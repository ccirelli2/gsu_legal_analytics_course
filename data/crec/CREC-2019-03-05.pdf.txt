House of Representatives
The House met at noon and was

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO
TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker:
WASHINGTON, DC,
March 5, 2019.
I hereby appoint the Honorable TED LIEU
to act as Speaker pro tempore on this day.
NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker of the House of Representatives.

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT
A message in writing from the Presi-
dent of the United States was commu-
nicated to the House by Ms. Mariel
Ridgway, one of his secretaries.
f
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 3, 2019, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by
the majority and minority leaders for
morning-hour debate.
The Chair will alternate recognition
between the parties. All time shall be
equally allocated between the parties,
and in no event shall debate continue
beyond 1:50 p.m. Each Member, other
than the majority and minority leaders
and the minority whip, shall be limited
to 5 minutes.
f
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Arkansas (Mr. HILL) for 5 minutes.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker,
in recent weeks, it has been sad to read
that a judicial nominee, Brian
Buescher from Nebraska, has been tar-
geted for his membership in the
Knights of Columbus as a part of his
Senate Judiciary Committee’s review
of qualifications.
The assertion that being a Catholic
and being a member of the Knights of
Columbus would prevent Mr. Buescher
from properly and effectively serving
our Nation is preposterous.
Religion should not be a factor when
measuring someone’s ability to serve
their country.
I remind Senators that our Constitu-
tion, in Article VI, states that ‘‘no reli-
gious test shall ever be required as a
qualification to any office or public
trust under the United States.’’
The Knights of Columbus was origi-
nally founded over 120 years ago. It is
a society for working-class and immi-
grant Catholics and is still true to its
founding principles of charity, unity,
and fraternity.
As a Catholic, my faith plays a sig-
nificant role in every aspect of life and
fosters a respect for the religious
rights and freedoms of others.
I was encouraged to see last month
that the Senate unanimously passed a
resolution confirming that membership
in a religious organization does not
make a person unfit for public office.
Fundamental American values,
among which are commitments to reli-
gious freedom and human rights, will
always be the cornerstones of U.S. do-
mestic and foreign policy.
I will continue to advocate for the
rights of individuals to express their
feelings without living in fear of vio-
lence and persecution.
RECOGNIZING MATTHEW ZAJAC
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize Matthew Zajac,
a double amputee Army vet, for his re-
markable service to our country and
welcome him to his new home in Little
Rock, Arkansas.
In 2007, during a deployment to Iraq,
Matt and members of his unit encoun-
tered an IED, which exploded under
their Humvee.
Matt lost both of his legs; shrapnel
tore through his wrist; and severe
burns covered the right side of his
body. He received the Purple Heart for
his injuries and was medically retired.
Mr. Speaker, 2013 marked the start of
a downward spiral for Matt after losing
his grandmother and his dad, a man
who had stood by his side throughout
the entire recovery process.
Matt came to Arkansas seeking more
than just help. He needed a commu-
nity. Today, central Arkansas commu-
nity groups, veterans support organiza-
tions, and our VA hospital are helping
Matt restart his life.
He is seeking proper treatment for
his PTSD and acts as a spokesman for
our Second Congressional District vet-
erans group, We Are the 22, which of-
fers assurance and hope for veterans
who are considering suicide.
Matt’s sacrifice for Arkansas and
America will never be forgotten, and I
join all Arkansans in offering Matt a
heartfelt welcome to his new house in
North Little Rock.
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN VENEZUELA
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I
rise to address the ongoing humani-
tarian crisis in Venezuela and the inef-
fective, inhumane, and irresponsible
actions of the Maduro government.
For years, Venezuela’s United Social-
ist Party has pushed a once-prosperous
nation towards desperate poverty and
open tyranny.
Today in Venezuela, Maduro cele-
brates while his people eat garbage.
For too long, the authoritarian re-
gime has acted without accountability.
Water sanitation is nonexistent, and
hospitals stand without power or medi-
cine, the results, Mr. Speaker, of 20
years of irresponsible socialism under
the Chavez and Maduro regimes—all
this while 200 tons of U.S. food and
medical assistance sit unused at the
Venezuela-Colombia border, blocked by
Maduro from entering the country.
I stand with the Organization of
American States and over 50 countries

their freedom back.
f
CLOSE THE LOBBYIST LOOPHOLE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
New York (Mr. ROSE) for 5 minutes.
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I rise today to urge my colleagues to
support the Lobbyist Loophole Closure
Act.
This bill will close a loophole that
lobbyists on both sides of the aisle—
and they are lobbyists—have been tak-
ing advantage of for far too long. They
have been using it to skirt disclosure
under the guise of just providing stra-
tegic guidance for billion-dollar cor-
porations.
You know, when I go back to Staten
Island and south Brooklyn, they see
right through this. They see it for what
it is, people getting over on the system
on the backs of hardworking Ameri-
cans. And they are tired of it.
It is time that we do our job here in
the Halls of Congress to end this. This
is the way our jobs should work, be-
cause for far too long we have been al-
lowing lobbyists on both sides of the
aisle to undermine this process and
keep our constituents in the dark.
Just look at this—both sides of the
aisle. We have seen this in my own
party with former Senate majority
leader Tom Daschle:
He laid the blueprint for the shadow lob-
bying industry. He did work that looks,
smells, and tastes a lot like lobbying, but
the public was in the dark. He earned mil-
lions advising healthcare clients and others
about how to navigate Congress without reg-
istering as a lobbyist.
And on the Republican side, the
President’s former lawyer, the infa-
mous Michael Cohen, getting paid hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars for pro-
viding strategic guidance to corpora-
tions when, in truth, it was providing
access to the President without ever
registering as a lobbyist. Again:
Used his ties to the President to land con-
sulting agreements; secretly hired to work
on the same issues their lobbyists were al-
ready registered to work on; was paid mil-
lions of dollars to help influence administra-
tion policy without once registering as a lob-
byist.
Folks, this is corruption. Mr. Speak-
er, make no mistake, this is corrup-
tion.
And no matter if you are a Democrat,
if you are a Republican, or if you are
an independent, we all see it for what
it is.
Now, this is why H.R. 1 is such an es-
sential step. I applaud my Democratic
colleagues for putting a bold
anticorruption bill on the floor of the
House this week, of which the Lobbyist
Loophole Closure Act will be a part.
We have got to take this opportunity
and push the ball forward because, for
the last 4 years, the American people
have been voting for change. The Re-
publicans called it draining the swamp.
The Democrats called it
anticorruption.
The American people are united
against the American political class.
They are united against the D.C. polit-
ical class.
We have got to do something about
it, because, if it looks like a lobbyist, if
it talks like a lobbyist, if it acts like a
lobbyist, then, Mr. Speaker, let’s call it
a lobbyist. Let’s disclose it and regu-
late it as such.
f
COMMEMORATING THE 157TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE HOMESTEAD
ACT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Nebraska (Mr. SMITH) for 5 minutes.
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise to commemorate the 157th an-
niversary of the Homestead Act pass-
ing the House of Representatives.
The Homestead Act was instrumental
in bringing settlers to the Midwest and
forming the State of Nebraska, as it al-
lowed any qualified person to claim up
to 160 acres of Federally owned land in
exchange for 5 years of living on and
improving the property.
Homestead National Monument,
which is located in Nebraska’s Third
Congressional District, commemorates
this law.
Unfortunately, the name of this facil-
ity does not represent its cultural and
historical value, as many tourists show
up looking for a physical monument
rather than a park, which would more
accurately describe it.
For this reason, and at the request of
the local community, I introduced a
bill on Thursday, February 28, the
law’s anniversary, to reclassify Home-
stead National Monument as a national
historical park.
I ask my colleagues to support this
bill in order to maximize its value in
terms of education, tourism, and eco-
nomic development for the surrounding
community as it commemorates an im-
portant event in our Nation’s history.
f
REMEMBERING REPRESENTATIVE
WALTER JONES
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. GAETZ) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I come to
the floor to remember my good friend
and our late colleague Representative
Walter Jones.
Walter Jones was someone who deep-
ly cared about this institution and the
constitutional principles that under-
gird our service. He was a respected
member of the Armed Services Com-
mittee, where he was a passionate ad-
vocate for military families and
against endless, senseless wars that
seem, too often, to have a small per-
centage of Americans bear a dispropor-
tionate burden for the decisions that
are made by this body and others.
Walter was a deeply caring indi-
vidual. He was an encourager. When he
saw Members on the floor, regardless of
your seniority or your status within
the institution, he referred to everyone
as ‘‘chairman.’’ He thought that was a
distinction that should be shared and
one he used to revere those with whom
he served in this body.
He had friends on the right, on the
left, and in the middle, because Walter
treated everyone with respect and was
the ultimate southern gentleman.
I will miss his friendship, his guid-
ance, his mentorship, and this institu-
tion and this country will miss the
principle with which Walter Jones
served our great Nation.

cans, to nurture and guarantee demo-
cratic freedoms to all who dwell in our
great Nation. Help us all to be truly
thankful and appropriately generous in

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the

in the Pledge of Allegiance.
Mr. BRINDISI led the Pledge of Alle-

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
f
DEMOCRACY REFORM
(Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I
started in this business as a college
student. Inspired by what was hap-
pening with the civil rights movement,
I worked on the campaign to lower the
voting age to 18 in my home State of
Oregon and on the national campaign.
After that, I had the privilege to
work on a series of nonpartisan efforts
to expand the franchise, to improve
voting rights, to streamline access—bi-
partisan, not particularly controver-
sial.
It has been one of the biggest dis-
appointments of my life to find that
the issues that I worked on as a college
student continue to vex us. But I am
pleased today that we are in the proc-
ess of advancing H.R. 1, the most sig-
nificant democratic reform package in
a generation.
H.R. 1 will make it easier to vote, re-
gardless of income, ability, geography,
or race. It fights to end the dominance
of big money in our politics and enacts
tougher ethics standards to ensure pub-
lic officials actually work for the pub-
lic.
I am particularly proud of three pro-
visions that I helped incorporate into
the bill from our Oregon experience.
Oregon is a pioneer of vote by mail,
and bringing that model nationwide
paves the way for all States to be able
to offer vote by mail and early voting
that is secure and verifiable. It even
saves money for State and local gov-
ernments.
We have a provision that has auto-
matic voter registration for individuals
interacting with State agencies. They
are automatically registered to vote.
And it mandates that paper ballots
ensure election integrity and the abil-
ity to audit.
I look forward to our moving for-
ward, Mr. Speaker, to be able to deal
with this significant conversation to
make sure that we meet our responsi-
bility for the democratic process to
function.
f
HERITAGE MISSION FOR
SOUTHEASTERN KANSAS
(Mr. WATKINS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. WATKINS. Mr. Speaker, today, I
rise to encourage the President to sign
into law S. 47, the bipartisan lands
package, which includes my legislation
protecting the Fort Scott National His-
toric Site in Kansas.
My first piece of legislation, the Fort
Scott National Historic Site Boundary
Modification Act preserves the legacy
of the fort’s role in the American fron-
tier. This legislation solidifies the
community’s contribution to sup-
porting the Union during the Civil War.
Known locally as Lunette Blair, this
antique structure is the sole remaining
blockhouse that helped repel the Con-
federate invasion into eastern Kansas.
It is only through the stewardship of
the Fort Scott community that this
blockhouse still stands.
I thank my colleagues in the Kansas
delegation for joining me in this herit-
age mission for southeast Kansas.
f
BETTER OVERSIGHT OF CABLE
AND INTERNET PROVIDERS
(Mr. BRINDISI asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BRINDISI. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to call attention to the need for
better oversight of cable and internet
providers.
Between price increases, slow inter-
net speeds, and baffling fees, customers
in all regions of the country, and in my
district in New York State, are over-
charged by their cable company and
don’t always get what they have paid
for.
For customers on fixed incomes, a
sudden jump in the cable bill can put a
painful squeeze on other parts of the
family budget. Customers in rural
areas often find their broadband speeds
are not nearly as fast as advertised, if
they are lucky enough to have
broadband at all. That is why I am in-
troducing the Transparency for Cable
Consumers Act.
Under this bill, if a cable or internet
company is fined by the State public
service commission, the company
would be required to report to the FCC
what they are charging customers and
what they are delivering in return.
By bringing more transparency into
the market, we can help increase com-
petition and improve services for con-
sumers across the country.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO
VENEZUELA—MESSAGE FROM
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 116–19)
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message
from the President of the United
States; which was read and, together
with the accompanying papers, referred
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs
and ordered to be printed:
To the Congress of the United States:
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90
days before the anniversary date of its
declaration, the President publishes in
the Federal Register and transmits to
the Congress a notice stating that the
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to
the Federal Register for publication the
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive
Order 13692 of March 8, 2015, with re-
spect to the situation in Venezuela, is
to continue in effect beyond March 8,
2019.
The situation in Venezuela continues
to pose an unusual and extraordinary
threat to the national security and for-
eign policy of the United States. For
this reason, I have determined that it
is necessary to continue the national
emergency declared in Executive Order
13692 with respect to the situation in
Venezuela.

STREAMLINING ENERGY EFFI-

Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I move to
suspend the rules and pass the bill
(H.R. 762) to amend the Energy Policy
and Conservation Act to provide for
the dissemination of information re-
garding available Federal programs re-

servation Act (42 U.S.C. 6371a) is amended by
adding at the end the following:
‘‘(e) COORDINATION OF ENERGY RETRO-
FITTING ASSISTANCE FOR SCHOOLS.—

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members may
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 762.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I want to voice my
strong support for H.R. 762 introduced
by my good friend and colleague from
Pennsylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT).
This legislation will provide a coordi-
nating structure for our Nation’s
schools to help them better navigate
available Federal programs and financ-
ing options.
Across our great country, K–12 school
districts spend literally billions of dol-
lars on their energy bills each year,
while an estimated 14 million Amer-
ican children attend deteriorating pub-
lic schools. By upgrading these sys-
tems, we can increase efficiency and
focus school funding to achieve better
educational outcomes.
We have a huge opportunity this Con-
gress to make major investments in
our Nation’s infrastructure—including
our most essential institutions, such as
schools.
I believe efficiency has to be our fuel
of first choice. We can save local tax-
payers money while upgrading and
modernizing these facilities.
This legislation has passed the House
in each of the last two Congresses with
broad bipartisan support, and I am
proud to be an original cosponsor of
this year’s iteration.
I commend Representative CART-
WRIGHT and the bill’s bipartisan co-
sponsors for their efforts, and I urge
my colleagues to join me in voting for
the bill.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self as much time as I want to con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 762, was
introduced by Representative CART-
WRIGHT on January 24. I would note
that it is identical to bills that passed
the House in prior Congresses by a
voice vote, unanimous and bipartisan.
This legislation would require that
the Secretary of Energy establish a
clearinghouse to share information re-
garding available Federal programs to
help schools initiate, develop, and fi-
nance energy efficiency, distributed
generation, and energy retrofitting
projects. These types of energy up-
grades will help schools stretch their
budgets and reduce their impact on the
environment at the same time.
This is a good, bipartisan bill. It is
going to help schools take advantage of
existing programs to cut down on their
energy use. As I have said before, we
should continue to encourage these in-
novations in energy efficiencies to help
address climate change, and this bill is
a good step in the right direction.
Mr. Speaker, when I was a student, I
never had a legislator come visit my
class. As part of my district operation,
I visit a school literally every week.
So we all have districts that look
pretty much the same. I have probably
100-some school districts, close to 500,
600 school buildings for sure, and as I
have visited these classrooms in the
years that I have served, every school
is different. Many of these schools are
40, 50, 60 years old.
This legislation is needed. We want
to make sure that the money for edu-
cation not only goes to help our stu-
dents move forward, but, in fact, that
they are in a safe environment. Energy
conservation is something that is need-
ed at almost every one of our schools.
This is a good piece of legislation. I
hope that we can pass it again today by
a strong, bipartisan—perhaps, unani-
mous—vote, and I urge that the Senate
take it up as quickly as they can.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield as
much time as he may consume to the
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
CARTWRIGHT). Representative CART-
WRIGHT is from Pennsylvania’s Eighth
Congressional District.
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I
would like to thank the leadership for
bringing this bill up under suspension
today, and to Representative TONKO for
yielding time, also, to Republican
Leader UPTON for his kind words.
Mr. Speaker, I would also like to
thank the entire Energy and Commerce
Committee for their long-term support
for this bill. And I say ‘‘long-term’’ be-
cause this bill has passed the House
under suspension under each of the
past three Congresses.
Unfortunately, our friends in the
Senate—and I use that word loosely—
have yet to bring it to the floor. I am
glad the House is considering this bill
early in the session with plenty of time
for the Senate to act.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank
Congressman WELCH of Vermont, par-
ticularly, for his leadership on this bill.
It is no secret that he is one of the
great energy efficiency gurus in the
House, and it has been a pleasure for
me to work with him.
Mr. Speaker, across the country,
school districts spend billions of dol-
lars on their energy every year. These

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2329

are schools in need of upgrades and im-
provements to their facilities.
In its most recent Infrastructure Re-
port Card, the American Society of
Civil Engineers gave the condition of
our Nation’s schools a grade of D-plus.
Now, what this bill proposes are en-
hancements that improve the state of
our schools, our economy, and our en-
vironment by implementing economi-
cally and environmentally sustainable
changes so school administrators can
address short-term and long-term
needs. In reducing their energy bills,
schools can put the savings toward
other educational priorities.
Now, according to the EPA and the
Department of Energy, K–12 school dis-
tricts, nationwide, spend approxi-
mately $8 billion on their energy every
year, second only to personnel costs. $8
billion exceeds the costs of textbooks
and supplies. An estimated $2 billion of
that cost could be saved by improving
energy efficiency, an amount that can
pay for 40 million textbooks.
Moreover, 43 percent of schools, ac-
cording to a Department of Education
survey, indicated that the poor condi-
tion of their facilities interferes with
the delivery of instruction. In fact,
high-performance schools can lower a
school district’s operating costs by up
to 30 percent.
Now, there are numerous Federal ini-
tiatives already available to schools to
help them become more energy effi-
cient, but these programs are spread
across the Federal Government, mak-
ing it challenging, time consuming,
difficult, and costly for schools to iden-
tify and take full advantage of these
programs. We are talking about har-
ried, busy school administrators that
don’t have the time to dive in to do
that kind of research.
These programs exist for schools to
utilize them. We should make every ef-
fort to assist schools in enacting sen-
sible upgrades that help our students
learn and help our schools run smooth-
ly and efficiently.
This bipartisan Streamlining Energy
Efficiency for Schools Act aims to pro-
vide a coordinating structure for
schools to help schools better navigate
available Federal programs and financ-
ing options. Now, this legislation does
not spend any additional money, and it
keeps decisionmaking authority with
the States, the school boards, and the
local officials.
The bill establishes a clearinghouse
through the Office of Energy Efficiency
and Renewable Energy. The clearing-
house will disseminate information on
Federal programs and financing mech-
anisms that may be used to develop en-
ergy efficiency, distributed generation,
and energy retrofitting projects for
schools.
The bill also directs the Office of En-
ergy Efficiency and Renewable Energy
to coordinate with Federal agencies
and develop an outreach program to
streamline communications and pro-
mote available Federal programs. For
example, outreach may provide a sin-
gle website where school officials can
learn, with one-stop shopping, about
the relevant programs.
This is commonsense legislation that
will ensure that schools can more eas-
ily take advantage of energy efficiency
programs. It is a strategic and cost-
saving investment to relieve the fiscal
pressure felt by school districts across
the Nation while bringing us closer to
energy security.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
pass this bill.
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I have no
further speakers on our side that I am
aware of, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield as
much time as he may consume to the
gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH),
my colleague and friend.
Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the ranking member; the chairman;
and the sponsor of this bill, Mr. CART-
WRIGHT, in persistent advocacy.
What Mr. CARTWRIGHT said really
makes sense. It is pretty bad, the con-
dition of many of our schools through-
out the country. About 43 percent are
in substandard condition. It has a real
impact on learning, but it also has an
impact on expense. It means that kids
are in cold and drafty schools or it is
too hot; it is one or the other.
Energy efficiency programs can
make a huge difference, and there are
some that are available.
As Mr. CARTWRIGHT said, the teachers
and the principals want to focus on in-
struction and taking care of the kids.
They don’t have time to manage and
investigate what are all of the pro-
grams out there that may allow them
to rehab their schools.
This allows the Secretary to essen-
tially provide a blueprint so that,
whether you are in a small town like
Norwich, Vermont, where I am from,
where we have got a population of
about 3,000, or you are in an urban dis-
trict in the middle of Chicago, you are
going to be able to get the information
you need without absorbing a lot of
staff time.
And then, by the way, kids are get-
ting involved in this question of cli-
mate change. This is a big deal be-
cause, at our schools and our high
schools, there is a lot of leadership
that is saying we have got an obliga-
tion to protect our planet. What is
going to happen when we embrace en-
ergy efficiency on a large scale but
start locally is that it is going to re-
duce carbon emissions.
In fact, when we passed the Waxman-
Markey bill in the House—it didn’t get
through the Senate—where the goal
was 80 percent carbon reductions by
2050, 40 percent of those carbon reduc-
tions were coming from energy effi-
ciency.
It is what Mr. TONKO says. It is our
fuel of choice. It is the cheapest way to
reduce carbon emissions.
The other thing is, every time you
are doing energy efficiency, it means
local tradesmen and -women are doing
the work. So it is those kids who are
going to have a warmer or a cooler
school, and it is their moms and dads
who are going to be doing the work to
make that happen. So this really
makes a lot of sense.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsor of
this legislation and leadership on the
committee for their work in bringing it
forward.
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge my
colleagues to vote for this legislation,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I encourage our col-
leagues to support this measure. Obvi-
ously, H.R. 762 enables us to make cer-
tain that we target wastefulness and
energy efficiency. It is a good way to
make certain that resources that can
be committed to education are not
wasted through inefficient use of en-
ergy—a good, strong message for the
development of our children.
So it is a great bill. I applaud Rep-
resentative CARTWRIGHT and his co-
sponsors for moving us forward and ask
that our colleagues support this meas-
ure.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from New York (Mr.
TONKO) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 762.
The question was taken; and (two-

RESPONSIBLE DISPOSAL
REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2019
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I move to

(H.R. 347) to extend the authorization
of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation
Control Act of 1978 relating to the dis-

The text of the bill is as follows:

vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 347.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, last September the
House approved an identical bill, H.R.
2278, in the 115th Congress by a voice
vote. Unfortunately, that bill did not
move in the Senate, so we are back to
reconsider H.R. 347, introduced by Mr.
TIPTON and cosponsored by my Energy
and Commerce colleague, Ms.
DEGETTE.
The Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation
Control Act established a process for
remediating inactive uranium-ore
processing sites, such as the one in
Grand Junction, Colorado.
To protect public health and safety
from potential risks, uranium mill
tailings must be disposed at a site that
is licensed and that meets standards
established by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission and the Environmental
Protection Agency.
The continued operation of the Che-
ney Disposal Cell is critical. Last year,
the Colorado Department of Public
Health and Environment provided the
following for the RECORD: ‘‘Given that
this is the only DOE uranium mill
tailings disposal site left in the coun-
try, it is critical that this facility re-
mains open to receive and dispose of
the uranium mill tailings that are dis-
covered in our communities. This ac-
tion will ensure the continued protec-
tion of human health and the environ-
ment.’’
The cell receives approximately 2,700
cubic yards of additional waste per
year, and has sufficient space to re-
ceive an estimated 235,000 cubic yards,
which represents 86 more years of oper-
ation at current rates.
H.R. 347 would authorize the Depart-
ment of Energy to continue to operate
the Cheney Disposal Cell through Sep-
tember 2048 or until it is filled to ca-
pacity. Currently, DOE is authorized to
operate this cell through September
2023.
Mr. Speaker, this is a good, bipar-
tisan bill, and I hope we can move it
forward today.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the gentleman from Illinois
(Mr. SHIMKUS) will control the time for
the minority.
There was no objection.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, first, with apologies to
our official reporter, and directed at
you, ‘‘let the good times roll,’’ ‘‘laissez
les bons temps rouler.’’
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 347, the Respon-
sible Disposal Reauthorization Act of
2019, was introduced by our Colorado
colleague, SCOTT TIPTON, and cospon-
sored by my Energy and Commerce
Committee colleague from Colorado,
DIANA DEGETTE.
H.R. 347 extends the authorization of
the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation
Control Act of 1978 site in Mesa Coun-
ty, Colorado. The legislation was
passed by the House last September,
and the bill today is identical to what
we passed last year, save a change in
dates.
The legislation was considered by the
Subcommittee on Environment and
marked up through regular order. It
was reported by the full committee
with a bipartisan amendment by a
voice vote.
Mining and processing of uranium
generates a byproduct known as ura-
nium mill tailings. Congress passed the
Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Con-
trol Act 4 years ago to establish the
framework for DOE to dispose of mill
tailings, which are left over from nu-
clear defense activities and the devel-
opment of our commercial nuclear in-
dustry.
The act also authorized the Grand
Junction, Colorado, site to serve as a
disposal location. This is the only DOE
uranium mill tailings disposal site re-
maining open in the Nation, so it is
necessary for the final disposition of
mill tailings discovered in commu-
nities.
H.R. 347 extends the site’s current au-
thorization until 2031. The extension
will enable the site to plan long-term
operations to protect public health and
the environment.
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this
bill, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I have no
additional speakers on my side, and I
continue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON),
the author of the legislation.
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank
my colleague from Illinois for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, the Department of En-
ergy’s Cheney Disposal Cell in Mesa
County, Colorado, is a critical compo-
nent of the DOE legacy management
mission to protect public health and
the environment.
The cell receives radioactive waste
materials that were produced decades
ago during the uranium milling proc-
ess. The waste materials continue to be
uncovered during road construction,
bridge replacement, home foundation
excavation, and other construction ac-
tivities in several towns in western
Colorado. Once the waste materials are
discovered, they must be properly dis-
posed of at the Cheney Disposal Cell.
The authorization for the Cheney
Disposal Cell expires at the end of 2023,
or when the site is filled to capacity.
Currently, the remaining capacity in
the cell is approximately 234,000 cubic
yards, therefore, an extended author-
ization is required. H.R. 347 would ex-
tend the authorization until 2031.
As my colleague from Illinois noted,
we passed this legislation in the last
Congress, but this bill is now coming
up at a critically important time. Ac-
cording to the Department of Energy,
if the disposal cell is not reauthorized
this year, DOE will have to take steps
to begin to decommission the site. This
means no more materials will be ac-
cepted in 2019 and we will lose a crit-
ical component of the DOE’s legacy
management program.
I thank my colleague from Colorado,
Ms. DIANA DEGETTE, for her support on
this bill, and for her leadership on the
Energy and Commerce Committee for
recognizing the need to bring this bill
up now.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support H.R. 347.
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I have no
additional speakers, and I continue to
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I urge
passage of the bill, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I, too, for
the reasons that this legislation would
allow for the only disposal site of its
kind in the country, it is important
that we pass this important infrastruc-
ture concept, and I encourage our col-
leagues to support the bill.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from New York (Mr.
TONKO) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 347.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on

REAUTHORIZING WEST VALLEY
DEMONSTRATION PROJECT
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I move to
suspend the rules and pass the bill
(H.R. 1138) to reauthorize the West Val-
ley demonstration project, and for
other purposes.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 1138
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members may
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1138.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, last September, the
House approved an identical bill, H.R.
2389, in the 115th Congress, by a voice
vote.
Unfortunately, that bill did not move
in the Senate. Today, we will recon-
sider H.R. 1138, which has been reintro-
duced by my New York colleague and
friend, Mr. REED.
The Western New York Nuclear Serv-
ice Center in West Valley, New York,
has been the center of disputes and leg-
islative actions since the 1980s. This
site is a difficult reminder that we are
still dealing with the consequences of
our Nation’s entry into the atomic age.
While the site is owned by New York
State, between 1966 and 1972 it was op-
erated by a private business to reproc-
ess spent nuclear fuel primarily pro-
vided by the Federal Government.
Those reprocessing activities ended
decades ago, but high-level waste and
transuranic waste continue to be
stored at the site.
A cost-sharing agreement for the
site’s remediation has been resolved,
but disposal of the waste remains a
point of contention.
Since 1986, DOE has classified the
waste as commercial rather than waste
deriving from atomic energy defense
activities.
Under this classification, DOE be-
lieves that the cost for disposal of the
wastes should be borne by the State of
New York. New York State believes
that since 60 percent of the material
sent to West Valley was from facilities
that conducted defense activities, and
80 percent of the reprocessed plutonium
shipped out of West Valley was sent to
defense facilities, it should be cat-
egorized as defense-related waste.
This classification disagreement has
major consequences for how the waste
can be disposed of and who will be re-
sponsible for covering the costs. While
I would prefer more certainty in clari-
fying the wastes’ classification, this
legislation puts us on a path towards
solving this issue by requiring a GAO
report on the origins of and disposal
pathways, including cost estimates.
In addition, the bill reauthorizes the
West Valley Demonstration Project at
$75 million annually for 7 years. This
funding level is in line with historic ap-
propriations levels and will ensure the
cleanup will continue on schedule.
This bill may not resolve the dec-
ades-old dispute between New York and
the Department of Energy. It does ad-
dress funding for the remediation of
the site and attempts to move the ball
forward to ensure that wastes are dis-
posed of properly and, most impor-
tantly, fairly.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1138, a bill to reau-
thorize the West Valley Demonstration
Project, was introduced recently by
our New York colleague, TOM REED. I
also see my good friend, BRIAN HIGGINS
on the floor, and I know the chairman
has been personally involved with this
for many, many, many years.
The House passed an essentially iden-
tical version of this bill this past Sep-
tember on suspension. Prior to that
vote, the bipartisan legislation had
moved through the Energy and Com-
merce Committee by regular order, in-
cluding a legislative hearing and mark-
ups as part of our broader nuclear
waste management agenda. It was re-
ported by the full committee with a bi-
partisan amendment by a voice vote.
H.R. 1138 authorizes appropriations
to support the Department of Energy’s
environmental remediation at its West
Valley cleanup site in New York
through 2026. It also directs a study to
help Congress determine the final dis-
position of radioactive waste that DOE
is cleaning up at the site.
H.R. 1138 continues the work of Con-
gress to address the Federal Govern-
ment’s obligations for treatment and
disposal of the legacy waste produced
during the Cold War, and through the
Federal Government’s early efforts to
develop a civilian nuclear energy in-
dustry.
The Department of Energy has suc-
cessfully remediated 92 sites of this
waste, but the most technologically
challenging projects remain in process
at 17 locations, one of which is the
West Valley site.
In 1980, Congress passed the West
Valley Demonstration Project Act to
direct DOE to address legacy environ-
mental issues and authorized appro-
priations only through fiscal year 1981.
The project has not been reauthorized
since that time, despite Congress fund-
ing DOE’s work at the site for the past
37 years.
H.R. 1138 corrects this situation, pro-
vides a path to answering important
questions concerning the waste disposi-
tion, and ensures spending at the site
is subject to an active authorization.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in supporting H.R. 1138, and I
reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from New York (Mr. HIG-
GINS), my colleague and friend from the
26th Congressional District.
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr.
Speaker, I rise in strong support of
Congressman TOM REED’s bill, H.R.
1138, which authorizes funding for the
cleanup of the West Valley demonstra-
tion project, the nuclear waste remedi-
ation site in western New York.
Mr. Speaker, advocates are in Wash-
ington this week to remind Congress of
the importance of the Great Lakes as a
source of clean water for millions of
Americans. The long-term cleanup at
West Valley, which sits 30 miles from
Lake Erie and at the foot of a tribu-
tary stream, will prevent harmful con-
tamination to the region.
The Department of Energy has an ob-
ligation to ensure that 600,000 gallons
of high-level radioactive waste are so-
lidified and disposed of safely and expe-
ditiously. The funding in this bill will
allow us to do just that.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this bill.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from New York (Mr. REED),
the author of the legislation.
Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS)
for yielding me the time and his lead-
ership on this issue, as well as my good
friends PAUL TONKO and BRIAN HIGGINS
for joining me in the effort today in re-
gards to the West Valley Reauthoriza-
tion Act before us.
Obviously, Mr. Speaker, I rise in
strong support of this legislation. This
legislation deals with the project lo-
cated in our district in western New
York and the great community of West
Valley.
West Valley, New York, is the home
of radioactive waste that has been dis-
tributed there and deposited there over
the years way back when. But I will
tell you, over the last 15 years, this
site has led the Nation, in my humble
opinion, in coming up with techniques
and technologies that are deployed
across other nuclear waste facilities
and sites in order to handle that high-
level radioactive waste from those fa-
cilities as well as those in West Valley.
Mr. Speaker, I think it is only right
to bring further clarity and certainty
to our area of the district at West Val-
ley in regards to this bill, giving 7
years’ worth of reauthorization legisla-
tion, to send the signal that not only
do we stand and support the appropria-
tions that go to this facility in order to
clean it up in the most efficient and ef-
fective manner, but, also, we stand as
authorizers to say that this type of fa-
cility and this type of program needs

to be renewed for at least 7 years be-
cause, Mr. Speaker, it is going to take
many more years to clean this site up.
Giving this site 7 years of that addi-
tional certainty is the only right thing
to do in order to have these folks who
are doing the hard work be given the
indications from Congress that we
stand with them as they engage in this
effort.
As I close, Mr. Speaker, I want to
thank the entire Energy and Commerce
Committee and Mr. SHIMKUS for his
tireless work on the issue of nuclear
waste cleanup and standing with us on
this piece of legislation.
In particular, Mr. Speaker, I would
like to thank the local officials: the
town of Ashford supervisor, Charles
Davis; the West Valley deputy general
manager, Scott Anderson; and the
other local leaders who have stood in a
community effort in order to bring this
West Valley demonstration site to a
complete closure, hopefully, in the
near future with the legislation that
we have before us.
So I ask my colleagues to join in sup-
port of this legislation, and I truly ap-
preciate their efforts to join us today.
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I urge
my colleagues to join me in supporting
H.R. 1138, and I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, West Val-
ley, as an issue, has been there for a
long time. It is good to know that we
are moving the ball forward.
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this measure, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from New York (Mr.
TONKO) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1138.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P.
ROE) each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself as much time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I, too, in celebration of
today say ‘‘laissez les bons temps
rouler.’’
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support
of H.R. 1381.
During Operations Enduring Freedom
and Iraqi Freedom and in other parts of
the world where American servicemem-
bers were deployed, the Department of
Defense exposed brave Americans to
toxic fumes and dangerous chemicals
by burning waste in open-air burn pits.
Some of the waste burned in these
open-air pits were human waste,
Styrofoam, lithium batteries, tires,
medical waste, and other toxic sub-
stances. Servicemembers had no way to
avoid inhaling the smoke from these
burn pits that were located on their
bases, sometimes right next to their
barracks.
When this committee held a hearing
last year on burn pits, we heard from
Leroy Torres, the founder of Burn Pits
360, who breathed in burn pit smoke
while stationed in Balad Air Base in
Iraq in 2007. When he returned home in
2008, he needed immediate hospitaliza-
tion for lung disease.
Mr. Torres and other veterans suf-
fering from medical conditions believed
to be caused by exposure to burn pits
are still fighting to receive healthcare
and benefits because illnesses poten-
tially caused by burn pit exposure still
aren’t recognized by the VA.
Research to understand the harmful
effects these toxic substances may
have had on military servicemembers
is now underway. However, the totality
of harmful health effects this dan-
gerous practice may have had on serv-
icemembers is yet to be fully known
and understood, and it may take years
for clinicians and scientists to under-
stand the health effects or discover ef-
fective treatments for those who were
exposed.
In an effort to better track the
health effects these exposures had on
deployed troops, Congress required the
VA to create the open burn pit registry
in 2012 to compile self-reported data on
veterans who believed they were ex-
posed to open-air burn pits while serv-
ing in Iraq and Afghanistan.
This registry allows VA to easily
communicate with this population of
veterans, as well as track trends within
the population that may indicate a
need for further research into certain
health concerns. However, the registry
failed to provide, in it, the ability to
report cause of death for veterans who
are registered and then subsequently
pass away.
Congressman RUIZ’s bill, the Burn
Pit Registry Enhancement Act, would
allow an individual designated by the
veteran during the registry process or
an immediate family member to up-
date the veteran’s file on the registry
with a cause of death.
These additional data will allow re-
searchers and the VA to identify
trends, similarities, and correlations in
this population that will better inform
our research efforts on the impact
these open-air burn pits have on the
servicemembers who served in combat
zones.
With the addition of more data to the
burn pits registry, we hope this will
help VA conduct groundbreaking re-
search that will lead to prevention and
treatments for toxic exposures, includ-
ing exposure to toxic substances ines-
capably connected to military service.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself as much time
as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 1381, the Burn Pit Registry En-
hancement Act.
This bill is sponsored by Dr. RAUL
RUIZ of California and Dr. BRAD
WENSTRUP of Ohio. Dr. RUIZ and Dr.
WENSTRUP are medical professionals,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2333
March 5, 2019
House Burn Pits Caucus. I am grateful
to them both for their efforts with re-
spect to this legislation and for their
continued dedication to serving our
Nation’s veterans on a bipartisan basis.
In response to growing fears about
the long-term health effects of burn pit
exposure, Congress required the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs, VA, to
create the Airborne Hazards and Open
Burn Pit Registry, the registry, in 2013.
The registry was intended to provide
a forum for servicemembers and vet-
erans to document the toxic exposures
they experienced in service to our
country and report health issues they
believe may be connected to those ex-
posures to VA to assist in research re-
garding toxic exposure impacts and
treatments.
While the registry continues to be an
important tool for those worried about
burn pits and other toxic environ-
mental exposures, advocates have ex-
pressed concern over the years that the
registry is not being used to its great-
est potential.
During a hearing before the Sub-
committee on Health last June, two
important stakeholder groups, Burn
Pit 360 and the Veterans of Foreign
Wars of the United States, or VFW,
recommended that the registry be im-
proved by allowing family members to
update the registry in the event of a
death of a servicemember or veteran
listed on it.
Accordingly, the Burn Pit Registry
Enhancement Act would, on the death
of a servicemember or a veteran listed
in the registry, allow an immediate
family member or other designated in-
dividual to report that servicemem-
ber’s or veteran’s death to the registry
and list his or her cause of death in the
registry.
According to Burn Pits 360, without
tracking the mortality rate through
methods such as allowing a surviving
family member to report deaths and
the cause of death, the registry’s abil-
ity to establish mortality rates related
to conditions and diseases associated
with toxic exposure will be precluded.
Mr. Speaker, I agree, which is why I
am pleased to support this bill today.
That said, I do regret that it did not
move through regular order. Had it
been subject to a committee hearing
and markup, it surely would have bene-
fited from a robust debate and discus-
sion by committee members, by VA,
and by veteran service organizations
and other interested parties and per-
haps made even stronger. I look for-
ward to continued committee work on
this important subject.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this
bill, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the comments from my colleague,
the ranking member, about regular
order. I can assure you we will discuss
this subject further, and I appreciate
and take to heart his comments.
At this time, I yield 5 minutes to the
gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ),
my good friend and the author of this
bill.
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Chairman TAKANO and his staff for all
their work on this. They have done a
great job. I thank them for fighting for
this bill and for their tireless work in
support of our veterans.
Mr. Speaker, I also thank the rank-
ing member, Dr. Phil Roe, for his sup-
port of veterans who have been exposed
to burn pits, and a special shout-out to
my good friend Congressman Dr. BRAD
WENSTRUP, who is the colead on this
bill. We have worked together on this
and numerous bills, and we are also
leading the efforts in the bipartisan
Burn Pits Caucus to really give an-
swers to our veterans who have been
exposed.
My bill, the Burn Pit Registry En-
hancement Act, will help our govern-
ment better understand the health ef-
fects of toxic burn pits on our men and
women in uniform.
As a nation, we have a responsibility
to provide our veterans with the bene-
fits that they have earned and deserve
and to keep them safe to the best of
our ability when they are in the field.
We bear that responsibility even
more heavily when the actions of our
own government—in this case, its use
of toxic burn pits—are causing vet-
erans to develop severe pulmonary ill-
nesses, cancers, autoimmune diseases,
and chronic conditions that are mak-
ing young, otherwise very healthy vet-
erans, extremely ill, permanently oxy-
gen-dependent, and totally disabled—
and, in some cases, leading to their
death.
This is what happened to Jennifer
Kepner, a constituent of mine, a moth-
er of two young children, and a veteran
of the United States Air Force. Despite
being only 39 years of age, living an ac-
tive lifestyle, very healthy, not having
any other risk factors, Jennifer devel-
oped a very aggressive pancreatic can-
cer that ultimately took her life.
b 1645
Jennifer’s oncologist conducted an
extensive genetic and environmental
risk assessment and found that the
only probable and most probable cause
of her cancer was her exposure to burn
pits. These are acres, sometimes 10
acres big, of open burn pits where they
burn everything and anything, like
that garbage open burn pit with jet
fuel, that exposes our servicemembers
to hundreds of toxic chemicals and car-
cinogens, with huge clouds of black
smoke that traverse long distances.
So while Jennifer was fighting brave-
ly against her cancer, she also had to
fight tooth and nail to get the
healthcare and benefits that she had
earned. Even then, the VA did not rec-
ognize her cancer’s connection to burn
pit exposures.
I was there in her final days, and she
wanted us to do something. She called
it our generation’s Agent Orange. She
wanted us to do something to prevent
this and to help other veterans.
There is a principle I use as a doctor
and a public health expert, and that is,
when there is a high enough suspicion
of an agent that can cause a severe
enough health consequence, then we
have to act on that suspicion. In this
case, we do have enough suspicion,
given the information that is out
there, that burn pits are essentially
toxic and causing health problems and
even death, so it is definitely severe
enough.
We need to do something. There are
four prongs that we need to pursue,
four pillars of a framework.
One is stop the use of burn pits.
Two is outreach to veterans and pro-
viders to educate them about their
risks.
Three is to make sure that we take
care of our veterans by providing
healthcare and some of the benefits
that they have earned.
Also, do more research so that we
can fully understand the full health ef-
fects of being exposed to these burn
pits.
This bill and the burn pit registry
will help with two of those prongs. One
is that it is a vehicle for the VA, DOD,
and our government to communicate
with veterans who have been exposed
to burn pits, and their family members,
about any recent health topics, re-
search, or policy change that they may
be interested in.
It also helps them grab samples of
veterans for future research so that we
can better understand with more ro-
bust scientific research the full effects
of burn pits in their lives, which could
lead to a better understanding, better
healthcare, better outreach, and more
benefits for our permanently disabled
veterans.
It is very important that veterans
who have been exposed to burn pits
register in the Airborne Hazards and
Open Burn Pit Registry and build this
communication vehicle with the VA,
our government, and those of us who
are strong advocates for our veterans.
My bill will allow an entry with the
cause of death in the Airborne Hazards
and Open Burn Pit Registry after a vet-
eran passes away. For example, right
now, if a veteran passes away, there is
no way to update this burn pit registry
with their cause of death. This allows a
spouse or a designee to enter that
cause of death.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield an
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman
from California.
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, those causes
of death could be brain cancer, esopha-
geal cancer, pancreatic cancer, auto-
immune diseases, lymphomas, leuke-
mias, constricted bronchiolitis, COPD,
and others.
Mr. Speaker, I urge each Member of
this Chamber to support this bipar-
tisan bill, which will help our Nation
uphold its commitment to serving our
veterans. Together, we are taking a
crucial first step toward honoring Jen-
nifer Kepner and improving and saving

the lives of countless veterans. I thank
the chairman for his support.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST), a very
active member and Marine Corps vet-
eran on the committee.
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 1381, the Burn Pit Registry En-
hancement Act. As the ranking mem-
ber said, I am a marine. As member of
the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, car-
ing for those veterans who have served
our Nation, and protecting them, is a
top priority for me. They should have
the peace of mind in knowing that they
will be cared for by a grateful Nation
after having that time that they
served.
I have had veterans come into my of-
fice with health problems, health prob-
lems that they shouldn’t be having.
They are young, and they don’t have a
family history. Sometimes, they just
can’t pinpoint the cause.
All too often, it can be from the use
of burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan. It
is equally frustrating that the VA
doesn’t have enough data to fully un-
derstand the effects of burn pits.
We have seen this movie before. We
saw it with people who were exposed to
Agent Orange, people who were serving
offshore, and the problems we have
dealing with blue water Navy Vietnam
veterans. They, too, faced the con-
sequences of unknown exposure risks.
We must do better. This bill seeks to
do that. This is a step forward. It is not
a fix all, but at least we are trying to
move in the direction that we need to
move and not be trapped in the same
situation we were with Agent Orange.
Today’s legislation is a bipartisan ef-
fort, and it puts our veterans first.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from South
Carolina (Mr. CUNNINGHAM), my good
friend and a member of the House Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee.
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker,
today, I rise in support of H.R. 1381, the
Burn Pit Registry Enhancement Act.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues,
Representative RAUL RUIZ and Rep-
resentative BRAD WENSTRUP, for all
their hard work on this bill and for
their leadership as co-chairs of the Bi-
partisan Congressional Burn Pits Cau-
cus.
As the Members of this body are
aware, one of the many perils our men
and women in uniform face overseas is
the threat of toxic exposure from burn
pits. To dispose of their waste, service-
members in Iraq and Afghanistan
tossed every variety of waste into mas-
sive pits to be set on fire, not knowing
the harmful chemicals they were likely
breathing in as a result.
Even today, we still do not fully un-
derstand all the risks associated with
exposure to burn pits. That is why Con-
gress established a voluntary registry
for veterans who served in the vicinity
of burn pits to document their experi-
ence and to learn more about ongoing
studies.
The data from this registry further
enables doctors and the VA to better
study the health impacts of burn pit
exposure and to develop lifesaving
treatments.
H.R. 1381 would strengthen this reg-
istry by allowing the families of de-
ceased veterans to update the registry
with the veterans’ causes of death.
This added data will give medical re-
searchers a more complete picture of
the effects of toxic burn pit exposures
and bring us closer to giving veterans
the answers and the treatment that
they deserve.
As a member of the House Committee
on Veterans’ Affairs, I am pleased to
support H.R. 1381, and I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to
pass this commonsense and pragmatic
bipartisan bill.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP), a
Congressman, colonel, doctor, former
member of the committee, and incred-
ible veterans advocate.
Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the former chairman for yielding
to me.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this
bipartisan legislation that I sponsored
with Dr. RUIZ, the Burn Pit Registry
Enhancement Act. I am pleased to have
Dr. RUIZ’ medical expertise engaged on
this issue.
Our Nation’s servicemembers experi-
ence a variety of threats to their
health and well-being, many of which
extend well beyond combat. The the-
ater of war can present many health
challenges that do not show up until
later in life. We are learning that burn
pit exposure can be one such condition.
I occasionally smelled that type of
smoke that can arise from burn pits
when I served in Iraq. I support in-
creased research into the range of
health impacts that can arise from
burn pit exposure. In order to effec-
tively help our Nation’s veterans, we
need an accurate registry of service-
members and veterans who were ex-
posed to burn pits, as well as detailed
records of health impacts from that ex-
posure.
Currently, the Airborne Hazards and
Open Burn Pit Registry monitors the
health records of veterans exposed to
burn pits. This registry helps the VA
identify health conditions possibly re-
lated to burn pit exposure or other air-
borne hazards that can arise during
military service.
It also keeps exposed veterans in-
formed about studies and treatments,
and it helps improve programs to help
veterans who are concerned that they
may have been exposed to toxic chemi-
cals while they were deployed.
The Burn Pit Registry Enhancement
Act will allow a veteran’s family mem-
ber or other selected individual to up-
date the burn pits registry with the
veteran’s cause of death. This will im-
prove the reported data available for
studies related to burn pits and help re-
searchers examine the full range of dis-
eases, health conditions, and outcomes
that may result from exposure to burn
pits.
Dr. RUIZ did an excellent job when he
spoke to many of those types of things
that we need to be concerned about.
We still have a lot to understand
about the impacts of burn pit exposure,
no doubt about it. This is one small,
but important, step toward that full
understanding.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I am
pleased to see that we have three doc-
tors who are either now or were associ-
ated with the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee and that they have supported
this legislation.
I have no further speakers, and I am
prepared to close, so I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, first of all, I thank Dr.
RUIZ, who was a very active member of
the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. I
really hated to see him leave our com-
mittee. He was a tremendous asset to
the committee and, as you can see,
continues to be that asset.
I think one of the things, Mr. Speak-
er, that this registry does is it also
shows us on the committee how impor-
tant it is to get our electronic health
records done, so that an Active Duty
military recruit can go in at 18 years of
age and have a virtual lifetime record
so that we will have a treasure trove of
data there 30 or 40 years later, as we
are doing right now in trying to figure
out what to do with Agent Orange.
If we do this correctly, we will be
able to not make these mistakes in the
future. We will be able to go ahead and
rapidly make these claims, adjudicate
these claims, so that veterans are
treated properly and get the medical
care they need.
I strongly support this bill, and I
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on
this bill.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I fully associate myself
with the remarks of the minority mem-
ber of the committee. Again, I want to
express my gratitude to the profes-
sionally trained physicians who have
weighed in on this legislation and fur-
ther commented about the importance
of the electronic health records and the
important oversight that was begun in
the last Congress, which will continue
in this Congress under my leadership.
I agree it is really important that we
get those records to work properly and
that the communication between the
Department of Defense and the VA is
functional.
I also think it is very important to
make sure that we get those legacy
records from the DOD wrapped into
this whole package, because the service

members have served and what they

ant to the rule, the gentleman from
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-

The Chair recognizes the gentleman

Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support
of H.R. 1271, the Vet HP Act. The De-
partment of Veterans Affairs reported
last month that it has 48,985 vacancies.
That means about 10 percent of the po-
sitions at VA are unfilled.
Sadly, a majority of these vacancies
are Veterans Health Administration
vacancies. VA does not have enough

physician assistants, and other medical

providers and support staff to make
sure veterans have timely access to the
high quality healthcare delivered by
VA. With shortages in areas like men-
tal health and primary care, it can be-
come increasingly difficult to maintain
a facility’s efficiency and quality. That
is why it is so important that VA does
everything it can to fill every last va-
cancy.
The committee is not blind to the
challenge of meeting this laudable
goal. Hospital systems throughout the
country also face health provider
shortages. Rural areas and some urban
areas are often the most in need of pro-
viders. However, that should not be an
excuse for inaction, and relying solely
on community providers who also face
shortages and lack the expertise and
cultural competency to provide for vet-
erans’ specific healthcare needs is an
incomplete, problematic, and high-cost
solution.
The VA must work to recruit and re-
tain talented and mission-driven clini-
cians and employees who are guided by
one goal: to provide the best possible
care to veterans when they need it.
The bill offered by Congresswoman
KAPTUR from Ohio is a creative and
necessary step towards ensuring VA is
able to fill each vacant position. The
Vet HP Act seeks to expose under-
graduate students considering careers
in medicine to experience the VA
healthcare environment directly. By
allowing undergraduates to observe the
work of staff at VA medical centers
firsthand, the department can begin re-
cruiting early—by sowing interest in
students about the VA’s mission and
the healthcare, research, academic, and
professional opportunities available to
clinicians at VA medical centers. As an
educator of 70 percent of the Nation’s
healthcare providers, VA can create an
early familiarity with VA among stu-
dents thinking about or preparing for
careers in medicine.
Our Nation’s future healthcare pro-
viders may be more likely to choose
residencies at academic affiliates of VA
medical centers and careers at VA if
they are more familiar with VA’s mis-
sion and are able to observe the im-
provements VA clinicians are able to
make in the lives of those who have
served our Nation.
Moreover, as the veteran population
becomes increasingly more diverse, VA
should strive to recruit students from
backgrounds as diverse as the military
and veteran population so that VA
staff and clinicians reflect that grow-
ing diversity and are better equipped
and able to understand the needs of the
veterans they serve.
In an effort to create a pipeline of di-
verse, mission-focused students, this
bill focuses specifically on students
who graduated from high schools in
health professional shortage areas, stu-
dents who attend Historically Black
Colleges and Universities and other in-
stitutions of higher education that
serve minorities, and first-generation
college students.
Giving students this exposure to VA’s
mission will help address the VA’s
48,985 vacancies so that it can continue
to provide the healthcare veterans
need.
I reserve the balance of my time, Mr.
Speaker.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 1271, the Veterans-Specific Edu-
cation for Tomorrow’s Health Profes-
sionals—or Vet HP—Act. The bill
would create a pilot program to pro-
vide undergraduate students with a
clinical observation experience at De-
partment of Veterans Affairs’ medical
centers.
This bill is sponsored by Congress-
woman MARCY KAPTUR of Ohio. I appre-
ciate her efforts to support aspiring
medical students by giving them a win-
dow into the healthcare profession.
This bill would further VA’s mission to
educate the Nation’s future clinicians
by giving those who have expressed in-
terest in the medical field an early in-
troduction to the VA healthcare sys-
tem.
It is my sincere hope that, if enacted,
this pilot program would inspire the
students it serves to pursue careers
serving veteran patients. While this
bill did not move through regular order
in the committee this Congress, it did
move through regular order last Con-
gress where it was supported by var-
ious veteran service organizations.
Mr. Speaker, I was proud to work
with my Democratic colleagues to get
this bill passed through the House last
year, and I am pleased to do so again
here today. I urge all of my colleagues
to join me in supporting this bill, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5
minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio
(Ms. KAPTUR), who is my good friend
and the author of this bill.
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I want to
thank Chairman TAKANO for his
staunch leadership for veterans in so
many arenas and for moving this bill
through his committee. I also want to
thank Ranking Member PHIL ROE for
his continued bipartisan support and
encouragement.
H.R. 1271, the Vet Health Profes-
sionals Act, Vet HP Act for short, also
called the Veterans-Specific Education
for Tomorrow’s Health Professionals
Act; I am honored to speak on its be-
half this evening.
By expanding opportunities for fu-
ture physicians interested in serving
our Nation’s veterans, this legislation
will lay the groundwork to help fill, as
was mentioned earlier, the Department
of Veterans Affairs’ nearly 50,000 med-
ical vacancies by creating a viable
pipeline for future physicians.
The Vet HP Act creates a 3-year pilot
program that will operate in at least
five VA medical centers for premed
students to gain clinical observation
experience, allowing them to gain a
deeper understanding of veterans’ spe-
cific health needs and experiences. We
have heard about some of those this
evening.
Several years ago, three premed stu-
dents—and I will put their names into
the RECORD—Andrew Frank, Seamus
Caragher, and Michael McNamara—
highlighted to my team that included
Andrea Kaman, Nora Sarsour, Carrie
Swope, and more recently Margaret
McGuinness, our legislative assistants,
the struggles that disadvantaged mi-
nority and other young people who
lack personal connections face as they
apply for medical school.
Health schools recommend or require
clinical observation hours, but there is
no formal process to apply for these
hours. Let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, in
the field of neuropsychiatry it is par-
ticularly difficult. Opportunities to
shadow are limited and are often based
on where you go to school or whom you
know.
Students who attend schools outside
major cities as well as those whose
families lack connections to the med-
ical community find it harder to shad-
ow and are disadvantaged in medical
school admissions. This places an un-
fair burden on otherwise qualified stu-
dents who come from less affluent com-
munities or even rural areas.
Through their own struggle to access
clinical observation experience, the
students realized an immense oppor-
tunity. This bill prioritizes students in
medically underserved areas, first-gen-
eration college students, students re-
ferred by minority-serving institu-
tions, and veterans themselves.
It also prioritizes training for stu-
dents who specialize in health profes-
sions where there is an identified staff-
ing shortage. This important bill will
help narrow the professional gap and
ensure we are training premed students
in careers that are in demand and nec-
essary. For example, the three VA
medical centers that service our con-
stituents in Ohio are located in Cleve-
land, Ohio; Ann Arbor, Michigan; and
the city of Detroit. They currently
have—this is an amazing number—542
medical and dental staff vacancies.
How are we to serve veterans when
we don’t have enough doctors and med-
ical professionals to do it?
This bill creates an important shad-
owing opportunity for health students
and will help strengthen the workforce
with a pathway going into the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs.
Importantly, premed students in this
pilot program will gain a deeper under-
standing of veterans’ specific health
needs and experiences, which is critical
for health professionals who treat vet-
erans.
One of our top responsibilities as a
Congress is to ensure that America’s
veterans receive top quality and timely
healthcare from highly trained profes-
sionals. This bill furthers that effort,
and I am pleased it will get a vote this
evening.
I would like to thank, again, Chair-
man TAKANO and Ranking Member ROE
for bringing this bill to the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2337
March 5, 2019
I urge my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle to support the bill’s passage
to strengthen medical care inside our
veterans’ healthcare system and help
the future be built through our work
here tonight.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of
my time.
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I strongly
support this bill. I have spent much of
my time over the years mentoring stu-
dents both in high school, college, and
in medical school. I have taught on the
clinical faculty at East Tennessee
State University College of Medicine.
I tell the students: Look, you really
need to think about going into medi-
cine if you like to work nights, week-
ends, and holidays.
That is not usually how I start the
conversation. But I look back as a
young man when I started, and I ask
myself, having now been serving in the
U.S. Congress, what would I do if I had
those choices all over again?
Unequivocally, I would go back to
the examining room and back to the
operating room and take care of pa-
tients. It is a phenomenal way to help
people. I think we have to share that.
I am a first-generation college grad-
uate in my family, as many of us are
who serve in this body, and I want to
thank both the chairman for his tre-
mendous support for medical education
in the Choice bill that we passed—it is
hard to believe—5 years ago, Mr.
Speaker, when the scandal in Phoenix
occurred. We put in that bill 1,500 resi-
dency slots at VAs in primary care so
that we would encourage those young
doctors to stay where they are train-
ing. Many of us will do that; we will
stay where we have done our training.
So I want to thank Congresswoman
KAPTUR for her interest in this. I thank
the students she brought up. Those are
the future doctors who are going to be
caring for all of us.
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this
bill, I urge my colleagues to, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the com-
ments of my colleague, the ranking
member, about our effort to insert 1,500
medical residencies into the Choice
bill. That was one of the great accom-
plishments of that particular Congress.
I would point out that we still face
shortages nationally of physicians and
specialists, and we face a great chal-
lenge with our medical workforce and
our healthcare workforce, and that im-
pacts the VA’s ability to fill these posi-
tions.
I particularly want to highlight the
gentlewoman from Ohio’s comments
about young people who do not have
the connections to medical profes-
sionals, or they are not necessarily
connected to the professional segments
of our society where they might be ex-
posed to what it means to be a medical
professional and what it means to serve
the VA’s mission. I think that her in-
sights and her experience and what she
brings to this bill is a tremendous un-
derstanding of the need for those of our
young people who come from lower in-
comes or who come from segments of
society that could be left behind. We
have Americans of great ability whom
we need to recruit and expose to the
opportunities that await them in orga-
nizations like the VA.
Let me just say that filling these va-
cancies is going to be a high priority of
the committee and to poke, prod, ca-
jole, and urge the VA to do what it
needs to do to reform itself in order to
make sure that these positions are
filled. Let me emphasize that these po-
sitions are funded, that these are fund-
ed positions. They are empty, and that,
to me, also indicates that we have a
workforce training challenge before us.
b 1715
H.R. 1271, offered by my colleague,
Ms. KAPTUR, is one of the necessary
steps that we need to take in order to
fill those vacancies.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in passing H.R. 1271, the Vet
HP Act, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from California (Mr.
TAKANO) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1271.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and to
insert extraneous material on S. 49.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-

There was no objection.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I move to
suspend the rules and pass the bill (S.

Department of Veterans Affairs in
North Ogden, Utah, as the Major Brent
Taylor Vet Center Outstation.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
S. 49
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) Major Brent Taylor began his military
service following the attacks of September
11, 2001. He joined the Army National Guard
in 2003, three days after his engagement to
his wife, Jennie. Five of his brothers would
eventually serve in the Armed Forces fol-
lowing the deadly attacks.
(2) During his time in the Army National
Guard, Major Taylor distinguished himself in
service to the United States and the State of
Utah. He received a commission as a second
lieutenant from the Brigham Young Univer-
sity Reserve Officer Training Corps in 2006,
while graduating as a member of the Na-
tional Society of Collegiate Scholars.
(3) During his impressive career with the
Utah National Guard, Major Taylor distin-
guished himself in multiple specialties, in-
cluding Intelligence and Military Police. One
of his earliest assignments included ana-
lyzing foreign language documents in sup-
port of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He
also led document exploitation efforts in
multiple European and South American lan-
guages for a variety of intelligence commu-
nity customers. Major Taylor also managed
a team that assessed security vulnerabilities
at high-profile facilities across the United
States, all while maintaining a successful
private sector career in Utah.
(4) Major Taylor was continuously ready to
take up a call to arms from the United
States and deployed four times in support of
operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. His de-
ployed duties varied from Platoon Leader
and Combat Advisor to Chief of Staff to the
Special Operations Advisory Group, respon-
sible for leading a joint task force advising
and assisting an elite Afghan special oper-
ations unit.
(5) Throughout his deployments, Major
Taylor distinguished himself on several oc-
casions, earning a multitude of awards in-
cluding the Bronze Star. The citation credits
the ability of Major Taylor to think calmly
and decisively to keep his subordinates safe
while traversing 600,000 miles of roads in
Iraq, laden with improvised explosive devices
(commonly referred to as ‘‘IED’’) and ripe for
ambush.
(6) During one particularly harrowing mis-
sion, Major Taylor’s vehicle was struck by
an IED. Although he survived the attack, the
wounds he received earned him the Purple
Heart.
(7) Major Taylor’s amazing record of serv-
ice was not limited to the battlefield. In 2010,
he served as a member of the North Ogden
City Council and, in 2013, Major Taylor was
elected mayor. His steadfast leadership led
to the city being recognized as ‘‘Business
Friendly’’ by the Governor of Utah, and as
one of the safest, freest cities in the United
States by several organizations. His initia-
tives included improvements to public works
and infrastructure, attracting businesses to
the area, developing a local community cen-
ter, and increasing transparency. His action
led his constituents to reelect Major Taylor
in 2017.
(8) In 2018, Major Taylor placed himself on
a leave of absence from his mayoral duties in
order to deploy to Afghanistan, explaining to
his constituents, ‘‘Service is what leadership
is all about.’’.
(9) While serving in Afghanistan, a dear
colleague, Afghani Lieutenant Kefayatullah,
was killed shortly before the Afghan elec-
tions. Major Taylor wrote, ‘‘The strong turn-
out at that election, despite the attacks and
challenges, was a success for the long-suf-
fering people of Afghanistan, and for the
cause of human freedom. I am proud of the
brave Afghan and U.S. soldiers I serve with.
Many American, NATO and Afghan troops
have died to make moments like this elec-
tion possible.’’. He also extolled the Amer-
ican public to embrace its civic duty, stat-
ing, ‘‘I hope everyone back home exercises
their precious right to vote. And that wheth-
er the Republicans or Democrats win, that
we all remember that we have far more as
Americans that unites us than divides us.’’.
(10) Tragically, on Saturday, November 3,
2018, Major Taylor was killed in an attack in
Afghanistan. He was survived by his wife,

Jennie, and his seven children, Megan, Lin-
coln, Alex, Jacob, Ellie, Jonathan, and Caro-
line.
(11) The impression that Major Taylor left
was indelible. An Afghan officer who had
served with Major Taylor penned a letter to
his wife, stating, ‘‘Your husband taught me
to love my wife Hamida as an equal and
treat my children as treasured gifts, to be a
better father, to be a better husband, and to
be a better man.’’. That officer further com-
mented that, ‘‘He died on our soil but he died
for the success of freedom and democracy in
both of our countries.’’.
(12) It is only well and fitting that, as a
tribute to the amazing life of Major Taylor,
Congress name a facility in honor of Major
Taylor’s shining example of service and sac-
rifice.
SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF MAJOR BRENT TAYLOR
VET CENTER OUTSTATION IN NORTH
OGDEN, UTAH.
(a) DESIGNATION.—The outstation of the
Department of Veterans Affairs located at
2357 North 400 East Washington Boulevard,
North Ogden, Utah, shall after the date of
the enactment of this Act be known and des-
ignated as the ‘‘Major Brent Taylor Vet Cen-
ter Outstation’’.
(b) REFERENCE.—Any reference in any law,
regulation, map, document, paper, or other
record of the United States to the facility re-
ferred to in subsection (a) shall be considered
to be a reference to the Major Brent Taylor
Vet Center Outstation.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P.
ROE) each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember the
life of Major Brent Russell Taylor, who
was killed in Afghanistan on November
3, 2018.
I thank my colleague, Mr. BISHOP of
Utah, for bringing this bill before us so
that we all may be able to pay tribute
to a selfless public servant.
Brent was born on July 6, 1979, in
Ogden, Utah, the second of eight chil-
dren of Stephen and Tamara Jones
Taylor. Five of his brothers joined him
in his military service in the Army Na-
tional Guard.
At an early age, Brent showed his
passion for business and politics. Dur-
ing his senior year at Chandler High
School, he earned his Eagle Scout
award and was elected student body
president. He graduated in 1997.
Brent was a man of faith. He was a
lifelong member of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints, and he
spent 2 years serving as a missionary
for the church in the Brazil Maceio
Mission from 1998 to the year 2000. This
time of full-time service largely im-
pacted the course of the rest of his life.
After his mission, Brent attended
Brigham Young University, where he
met Jennie Kristin Ashworth on a
blind date less than a month after she
returned from her own full-time serv-
ice as a church missionary in the Chile
Santiago North Mission.
They enjoyed a sweet courtship and
were engaged on a Saturday in June of
2003. Brent enlisted as a soldier in the
Utah National Guard the following
Tuesday, with Jennie proudly by his
side. They married on September 18,
2003.
In 2006, he was commissioned as a
second lieutenant from Brigham Young
University. He went on to work for the
Defense Intelligence Agency, the Na-
tional Ground Intelligence Center, and
the Department of Homeland Security.
Over the course of 15 years, he served
in the Utah Army National Guard, de-
ploying four times in support of oper-
ations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In 2009, he was elected to further
serve his community by sitting on the
North Ogden City Council, and in 2013,
he was elected mayor of North Ogden,
Utah.
In 2018, Major Taylor, a Purple Heart
recipient, left on his fourth deploy-
ment, acting as an adviser to the Af-
ghan Border Police. He was the first
known sitting mayor in Utah history
to deploy for wartime service.
Tragically, on November 3, 39-year-
old Major Taylor was killed in an in-
sider attack by an Afghan trainee he
was trying to help.
In addition to his wife, Jennie, Major
Taylor is survived by seven children:
Megan, Lincoln, Alex, Jacob, Ellie,
Jonathan, and Caroline. He is also sur-
vived by his parents and several sib-
lings.
In letters to his wife, Jennie, and his
children, his comrade, Afghan Air
Force Major Abdul Rahman, said of
Major Taylor: ‘‘He died on our soil, but
he died for the success of freedom and
democracy in both of our countries.
‘‘Your father was a loving, caring,
and compassionate man whose life just
wasn’t meaningful; it was inspira-
tional.’’
In his last message to his community
on October 28, 2018, Major Taylor
wrote: ‘‘It was beautiful to see over 4
million Afghan men and women brave
threats and deadly attacks to vote in
Afghanistan’s first parliamentary elec-
tions in 8 years. . . . Many American,
NATO allies, and Afghan troops have
died to make moments like this pos-
sible.
‘‘As the USA gets ready to vote in
our own election next week, I hope ev-
eryone back home exercises their pre-
cious right to vote,’’ he wrote, ‘‘and
that whether the Republicans or the
Democrats win, that we all remember
that we have far more as Americans
that unites us than divides us.’’
As lawmakers, the least we can do to
honor Major Taylor is to come to-
gether to pass S. 49 into law. His legacy
of fighting to protect democracy and
freedom and working to unite his com-
munity and all Americans must never
be forgotten.
We can all learn from Major Taylor’s
example to serve, as he would say,
‘‘whenever and however I can.’’
Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I owe
a debt of gratitude to Major Brent Rus-
sell Taylor and the entire Taylor fam-
ily for their service and sacrifice to our
Nation.
I fully support this bill naming the
Department of Veterans Affairs Vet
Center in North Ogden, Utah, as the
Major Brent Taylor Vet Center
Outstation and urge my colleagues to
do the same.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of S. 49, a bill to designate the
outstation of the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs Vet Center in North
Ogden, Utah, as the Major Brent Tay-
lor Vet Center Outstation.
This bill is sponsored by Senator
MIKE LEE of Utah and is a companion
bill to H.R. 54, which is sponsored by
Congressman ROB BISHOP, also of Utah.
I thank both of them for working to
honor Major Taylor in this way.
Having lost friends and classmates in
Vietnam, I know the loss that this
family is suffering is incalculable.
Family, friends, community, State,
and Nation mourn his loss.
Major Taylor’s life was characterized
by service both in and out of uniform,
and I am pleased to strongly support
this bill in his memory. Major Taylor
represents all that is right and good in
America.
My colleague, Congressman CHRIS
STEWART of Utah, is here today to
speak in support of this bill as well, as
he has a personal connection to the
Taylor family.
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
Utah (Mr. STEWART) to detail the in-
credible life that Major Taylor led and
the legacy that he leaves behind.
Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to, as these other gentlemen
have before me, honor a man who gave
everything he had to his God, his fam-
ily, and his country. These three great
loyalties guided the life of Major Brent
Taylor and the lives of his devoted wife
and children.
As has been indicated, I come from
generations of military service. Some
of my family had the great honor of
serving with Major Taylor. We know
from personal experience the great
leader and the great man that he was.
Mr. Speaker, 15 years ago, Brent Tay-
lor, hand in hand with his new fiancee,
Jennie, walked into a recruiting office
to enlist in the Army. Since then, this
man and his family—and it is so impor-
tant that we remember his family and
the many other families of military
members who sacrifice and serve as
well—have lived a life of patriotic ex-
emplary service.
He deployed twice to Iraq—in 2006
and again in 2007—and served in Af-
ghanistan in 2012.
For his outstanding dedication to
duty during combat operations in Iraq,
Major Taylor was awarded the Bronze
Star. This citation credited the ability
of Major Taylor to think calmly and
decisively to keep his subordinates safe
while traversing more than 600,000

miles throughout Iraq, areas riddled
with improvised explosive devices and
ripe for ambush.
This award recognized Major Taylor’s
tendency to do more than just carry
out the assigned task. He was a man
who went above and beyond to make a
positive difference in the world, believ-
ing his actions to be a small sacrifice
compared to what so many in our Na-
tion’s history have given up to keep
this the land of the free and the home
of the brave.
Such exemplary service is equally
evident in his life outside of the mili-
tary. After serving as a city council-
man, his community and neighbors so
entrusted him to lead that they elected
him to be the mayor of North Ogden
City.
In this role, Major Taylor’s initia-
tives included improvements to public
works and infrastructure, attracting
businesses to the area, and developing
a local community center.
The citizens of the community loved
his snowplow updates—in Utah, we get
a lot of snow—and his ability to see po-
tential and possibility in everything
around him.
Serving as mayor was one of the
greatest honors of Major Taylor’s life
and the highlight of his civilian profes-
sional career. He believed that service
is really what leadership is about.
On January 8, 2018, Major Taylor an-
nounced that he would temporarily
step down as mayor to continue his
service as a member of the Army Na-
tional Guard on what would be his
fourth and final deployment.
He didn’t deploy just once, not twice,
not three times, but four times he an-
swered the call to serve. And once
again, remembering his family, they
answered the call to allow their hus-
band and their father to serve.
This man recognized that there was
an immediate need for his experience
and skills and gracefully rose to accept
the call to serve in our Nation’s long-
est war in Afghanistan.
In his final months of deployment,
Major Taylor was killed by an apparent
inside attack on November 3, 2018,
while training Afghan security forces.
A loving husband and devoted father,
Major Taylor is survived by his wife,
Jennie, and, as you see here, his seven
beautiful children: Megan, Lincoln,
Alex, Jacob, Ellie, Jonathan, and Caro-
line.
One thing I am certain Major Taylor
would say: His family was far and away
the most important thing in his life.
Nothing made him more proud or
meant more to him than his wife and
his children.
The impression that Major Taylor
left was profound. He called on each of
us to find some way to brighten some-
one else’s day, to lift another’s burden,
to make our city, our State, our coun-
try, our Nation a better place.
This man and his family paid the ul-
timate sacrifice to fulfill this call, so it
is only well and fitting that, as a trib-
ute to this amazing life, Congress name
a facility in honor of his shining exam-
ple of service and sacrifice.
As has been mentioned, the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs Outstation in
North Ogden City will provide a range
of services to help guide veterans and
their families as they transition from
the military to civilian life.
Major Taylor recognized that mili-
tary service involves the entire family.
As such, I am proud to support the des-
ignation of this facility, located in a
city he loved and where he served and
called home, as the Major Brent Taylor
Vet Center Outstation.
The naming of the building will never
repay the debt the Nation owes to
Major Taylor and his family, but it can
stand as a humble reminder of the
faithful man who lived and died in the
service of his God, his family, and his
country.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I just want to say to my
friend and colleague, the gentleman
from Utah, that our hearts go out to
the families.
When I read the names of the seven
children, it was a very difficult mo-
ment for me, and we certainly are pay-
ing tribute today to his family, his
children, and his community of North
Ogden, where he served as mayor. It is
our tribute to him.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD
three letters—a letter from Frank
Maughan, Commander of the Disabled
American Veterans, Department of
Utah; a letter from G. Hayes
Stromness, Commander of the Amer-
ican Legion, Department of Utah; and
a letter from Nick Flake, Commander
of the VFW, Department of Utah—all
in support of S. 49.

DEAR CHAIRMAN ROE AND RANKING MEMBER
WALZ: Please accept this letter as dem-
onstrating the total support of the Utah De-
partment of the Disabled American Vet-
erans, in recognition of the ongoing initia-
tive to change the name of the Veterans’
Center in Ogden, Utah to the Major Brent
Taylor Veterans’ Center, in memory of Army
National Guard major and North Ogden
mayor, Brent Taylor.
Major Taylor’s model of selflessness in the
areas of military service and civic responsi-
bility should be a shining example for all
Americans to follow.
Major Taylor began his military service in
2003, and later received a commission as a
second lieutenant from Brigham Young Uni-
versity in 2006. He served in the Utah Army
National Guard for 15 years, during which he
deployed four times in support of US oper-
ations in Iraq and Afghanistan. His life of
service, however, was not limited to the
armed forces, and in 2013 he was elected
mayor of North Ogden, Utah. His devotion to
duty as a citizen soldier, in the tradition of
George Washington, Ulysses Grant and
Dwight Eisenhower. In 2018, Major Taylor
left on his fourth deployment, acting as an
advisor to the Afghan Border Police. Trag-
ically, on Saturday, November 3rd, Major
Taylor was killed in an apparent insider at-
tack. He leaves behind his wife and seven
children.
Today, the state of Utah, and the nation,
grieve for Major Taylor. We would like to
honor his amazing legacy. To that end we
offer our full support, and encourage the
committee to support legislation renaming
the Ogden facility as the Major Brent Taylor
Veterans’ Center.
Sincerely,
FRANK MAUGHAN,

Speaker, I yield myself such time as I

Mr. Speaker, this is one of the more
difficult things that we do. Obviously,
to see a beautiful family like this,
whose dad and whose husband has
made the ultimate sacrifice, it is dif-
ficult for me to stand here and under-
stand the pain that they have. I some-
times read Revelation 21:4; that may
help just a little bit.
I thank that family for their service
and wish them nothing but Godspeed
going forward. They will have some
tough days, I know, ahead of them, but
this is a grateful Nation. We very much
appreciate his service to our great
country. Our country is not better for
this loss.
I encourage my colleagues to support
this bill, and I yield back the balance

MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SUPPORT
GROUP OF HUDSON COUNTY
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to celebrate the launch of a won-
derful new group in my district, the
Multiple Sclerosis Support Group of
Hudson County.
Multiple sclerosis is a progressive
immune disorder. For people with MS,
the internal systems designed to keep
their bodies healthy wind up attacking
other parts of their body. Their im-
mune system eats away at the protec-
tive covering of their nerves.
Severe cases of MS result in paral-
ysis, vision loss, and diminished brain
function. Nearly a million people in
the United States are living with mul-
tiple sclerosis.
The MS Support Group of Hudson
County aims to bring people together
to help support, encourage, and uplift
people who are diagnosed with MS, as
well as their caregivers, friends, and
families.
I am proud of my constituents’ work
on behalf of the people in their commu-
nity. Groups like this serve an impor-
tant role in society, and I am honored
by their commitment to helping one
another.

READ ACROSS AMERICA DAY
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, Saturday kicked off
Read Across America Day and offi-
cially began National Reading Month.
The National Education Association
celebrates readers, authors, and stories
annually during March. For the past 20
years, NEA’s Read Across America Day
is a nationwide reading celebration
that takes place annually on March 2,
which is Dr. Seuss’ birthday.
Across the country, thousands of
schools, libraries, and community cen-
ters participate by bringing together
kids, teens, and books to celebrate
reading with young people. The mes-
sage is clear: Through the magic and
wonder of books, you can be anything
and go anywhere. This month helps
make students excited and engaged in
reading.
Children across the country have
celebrated Read Across America Day,
and I hope they keep it going for 365
more days because, as the beloved Dr.
Seuss said: ‘‘The more that you read,
the more things that you will know.
The more that you learn, the more
places you’ll go.’’
f
FAIRNESS FOR HIGH-SKILLED
IMMIGRANTS
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, we
often hear about the immunotherapy
revolution, medicine’s next frontier,
which is right now, for extending or
even saving lives. Dr. Sadhak Sengupta
and his wife, Sudarshana, two talented
scientists from Rhode Island, are on
the cutting edge of this research.
Dr. Sengupta is the director of brain
tumor immunotherapy research at
Rhode Island Hospital and an assistant
professor at Brown University. He has
been working as a scientist in the
United States since 2002, and he holds
numerous patents.
Despite these achievements, Dr.
Sengupta has been unable to get a
green card simply due to the country of
his birth, India. For years, we have
reached the per-country cap on em-
ployment-based green cards for India,
and the current backlog is, right now,
measured in decades.
Sadhak and Sudarshana dream of
launching a startup, but 17 years after
moving to this country, they still live
in uncertainty. Madam Speaker, that
is why I support the Fairness for High-
Skilled Immigrants Act, a bill to re-
move per-country green card caps and
treat all immigrants equally.
It is the right thing to do for the
Senguptas and for all Americans and
their families who will benefit from
their research and their greatness of
spirit.
f
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF FAITH CHRISTINE BARCROFT
(Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. WILLIAMS. Madam Speaker, I
would like to take this time to honor
the life and legacy of my good friend,
Jack Barcroft’s wife, Faith Christine
Barcroft.
Mrs. Barcroft resided in Gatesville,
in the 25th District of Texas that I rep-
resent. At the young age of 39, she
passed away on February 20, 2019, from
glioblastoma.
Glioblastoma is a very aggressive
cancer that can occur in the brain or
spinal cord. It is the most common
type of brain cancer, and almost 200,000
people die of it each year. Madam
Speaker, this number is far too high,
and it breaks my heart that my dear
friend fell victim to it.
Before and after her diagnosis, Faith
was a loving wife, mother, and daugh-
ter. She was often described as adven-
turous, welcoming, and she always put
her family’s well-being above her own.
This family has experienced an im-
measurable loss, and the entire
Gatesville community and I are pray-
ing for them.
While we cannot bring Faith back,
we can continue to raise awareness for
glioblastoma and the pain it causes
families like the Barcrofts. Unfortu-
nately, there is no known way to pre-
vent this type of cancer, but we must
not give up. We must bring attention
to this unforgiving diagnosis and pray
that one day, research will uncover a
cure.
Please keep this loving family in
your prayers.
May God bless the Barcrofts.
In God we trust.
f
OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM IS
RIGGED
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, constitu-
ents, Democrats, Republicans, and
Independents alike, have told me that
they feel that our political system is
rigged against working, middle-class,
and low-income Americans. And in
many ways, they are right.
It is rigged by politicians who make
it harder to vote, and it is rigged by
massive corporations that fund can-
didates who will give them tax breaks
and access to Washington.
H.R. 1 will move our country forward.
It will ensure every American can cast
a ballot, end partisan gerrymandering,
and reduce the influence of the
ultrawealthy, corporations, and special
interests. And it will allow us to fi-
nally get to work on the issues that
matter most to my constituents: cre-
ating an economy that works for all,
providing healthcare to all, and com-
bating climate change.
As part of this effort, I am proud to
introduce a bill that will help working
Americans make it to the voting
booth. By requiring every State to hold
at least 15 days of early voting, this
measure will raise turnout and make
our elections fairer and more rep-
resentative of our people.
Let’s return government to the peo-
ple. Let’s pass H.R. 1 right away.

HONORING THE FIRST RESPOND-
ERS TO THE RECENT FLOODING
IN TENNESSEE
(Mr. GREEN of Tennessee asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor the first
responders who have been working
around the clock tirelessly since the
recent flooding in Tennessee.
Last week, I visited a few counties to
see the damage and hear from the local
officials firsthand. The damage to our
infrastructure, homes, and businesses

was substantial. The flooding stranded
many Tennesseans, who had to be res-
cued by boat.
It breaks the heart to see so many
lose everything they own.
First responders and local leaders are
out every day and have been since the
flooding started. In many commu-
nities, mayors—in fact, in one commu-
nity, Mayor Carroll was out in a boat
delivering food and water to residents
of Perry County.
We are working hard to help these
Tennesseans return to normalcy, and I
hope you will join me in keeping every-
one affected by the floods in your pray-
ers.
f
LIFTING OF SANCTIONS AGAINST
OLEG DERIPASKA
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise
in strong opposition to the Trump ad-
ministration’s very curious lifting of
sanctions against Russian energy mag-
nate Oleg Deripaska.
The President and our allies must
strengthen sanctions against Russia,
not weaken them.
Russia illegally invaded the sov-
ereign nation of Ukraine and has killed
more than 10,000 people, including ci-
vilians. She has seized 24 Ukrainian
sailors and not released them. Russia
cyberhacks our firms and even our
democratic election process.
That is why Congress passed signifi-
cant sanctions in 2017 by an over-
whelming majority to raise the costs
on Putin’s sinister aims. Yet the
Trump administration caved to foreign
influence and, astoundingly, announced
it would lift sanctions on Deripaska.
Madam Speaker, America’s first job
is to protect liberty. It should not sell
off our liberty to billionaires, espe-
cially mob bosses who enable cold-
blooded murder in Ukraine. It does
make you wonder what forces pull the
strings of the Trump administration.
The free world must not be soft on
the Russian command structure, and I
look forward to hearing what addi-
tional sanctions our President proposes
to replace his ill-advised removal on
sanctions.
Stand fast, liberty lovers. Pay atten-
tion.
f
CONGRATULATING KAREN MILLER
ON HER RETIREMENT
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to congratulate Karen Miller
from Richland, Washington, on her re-
tirement and to honor her 20 years of
service to the ratepayers of the Benton
Public Utility District in Washington
State’s Fourth Congressional District.
Karen has been a tireless advocate
for the Tri-Cities community and for
the reliable, affordable power gen-
erated by central Washington’s hydro-
electric dams. She has been at the fore-
front of the community’s efforts to
‘‘Save Our Dams,’’ spearheading rallies
and events like RiverFest, to celebrate
the countless benefits of the Columbia
and the Snake River dams.
While I know the team at Benton
PUD will sorely miss Karen’s enthu-
siasm and friendship, I am confident
her service to the community will con-
tinue.
I wish Karen and her husband, Ken,
the best as they spend more time en-
joying golfing, traveling Europe, and
enjoying time with their beloved
grandchildren.
Congratulations, Karen.
f
CELEBRATING GINNY WALKER’S
100TH BIRTHDAY
(Ms. FOXX of North Carolina asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute.)
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I rise to wish Mrs. Ginny
Walker a happy 100th birthday. It has
been a delight getting to know Mrs.
Walker and her family since they
began splitting their time between
homes in Greensboro and Land Harbor
in North Carolina’s Fifth District.
Mrs. Walker is a mother of two,
grandmother of three, great-grand-
mother of six, and beloved by all of
them. Shortly after moving to North
Carolina, her husband, Delmer, started
Delta Electronic Plating Company, and
she went back to school to learn how
to keep books and even helped in the
plant and driving trucks.
Mrs. Walker remains an engaged cit-
izen to this day, especially in bridge
circles and First Baptist Church, where
everyone enjoys her pies.
At 100, I hope to be as full of life as
Mrs. Walker, and I wish her a wonder-
ful birthday and many, many more to
come.
f
CALIFORNIA’S HIGH-SPEED RAIL
SYSTEM
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to highlight some new legis-
lation I am introducing this week, H.R.
1515, the High-Speed Refund Act.
Simply put, California’s proposed
high-speed rail system has been a total
disaster. It will not meet the legal re-
quirements of true high-speed rail from
San Francisco to Los Angeles. The
total projected cost has now ballooned
to $100 billion, tripling what the voters
were told back in 2008.
The Trump administration has al-
ready canceled a $929 million grant, but
I think they should take the entire $3.5
billion in Federal dollars that Cali-
fornia is wasting under the Stimulus
Act of 2009, 10 years ago. That is why
my bill, the High-Speed Refund Act,
would require California to refund all
Federal funding for high-speed rail and
repurpose it to highway and transpor-
tation projects that would actually
benefit people and be economically via-
ble.
Madam Speaker, $5 billion has al-
ready been wasted. Let’s not make it
$100 billion. Undertaking the project
was a huge mistake. I think Califor-
nians and the other 49 States deserve a
refund and to have this money chan-
neled into something that would be
more useful for all Americans.
f
HONORING THE CONTRIBUTIONS
OF CLASSIC CHEVROLET
(Mr. OLSON asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, 10
years ago, March 2, 2009, big changes
happened back home in Sugar Land,
Texas. Bill Heard Chevrolet went to
the dustbin of history. It was replaced
by Classic Chevrolet. It opened on the
same lot at Southeast U.S. 59 and U.S.
90A. Don Kerstetter got it rolling. Jeff
and Tiffany Sebastian kept it rolling
stronger.
In 10 years, Classic has made Sugar
Land and Fort Bend County better. In
fact, they have been fully engaged in
our community. A few examples:
They participate every year in an an-
nual Classic Chevy Chili Cook-Off, rais-
ing tens of thousands of dollars for
first responders;
They support local schools, the Fort
Bend Education Foundation, last Sat-
urday, with Ray Aguilar of Classic em-
ceeing the event;
They support the Boy Scouts, Child
Advocates of Fort Bend boys choir, Im-
pact A Hero for combat-wounded vet-
erans, and on and on and on.
For 10 years, Classic Chevrolet has
had no need to find new roads. All
roads lead to Classic Chevrolet.

HONORING REPRESENTATIVE
WALTER B. JONES, JR.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
TORRES SMALL of New Mexico). Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2344 March 5, 2019
talk much more about that this
evening, as will I.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr.
PRICE), for his comments.
Then, Madam Speaker, we will be
recognizing our colleagues from both
sides of the aisle, which is extremely
appropriate, particularly in the case of
Congressman Jones.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I thank my colleague for
yielding and for calling this Special
Order to pay tribute to our departed
friend and colleague, Walter Jones, Jr.
Walter died on February 10, his 76th
birthday. He lived a full life of service:
four years in the National Guard, ten
years in the North Carolina General
Assembly, and nearly a quarter cen-
tury in this U.S. House of Representa-
tives.
Walter and I met long before either
of us served in the House. We worked
together on the Jimmy Carter Presi-
dential campaign of 1976. I have a
photo on my desk of a very youthful-
looking group of campaign workers to
prove that.
Walter, of course, went on to chart a
different course politically, a course
that was uniquely his own. In fact, he
found himself frequently at odds with,
if not one party, then the other, but by
the same token, he sometimes found
possibilities for alliances and coopera-
tion in unexpected places, and he didn’t
hesitate to take those opportunities.
Madam Speaker, tonight we are
going to hear from a wide range of col-
leagues, an amazingly diverse group of
colleagues that reflects the friendships
that Walter had in this Chamber. That
was also reflected in the delegation
that went to Greenville for Walter’s fu-
neral service on February 14. He was an
independent man and he just had
friends all over the place.
Now, that independence was rooted
in Walter’s strong convictions and his
personal sincerity. He actually, I think
we would all agree, stood out. In an age
in which sincerity is sometimes in
short supply in our Nation’s politics,
he earned respect and admiration on
both sides of the aisle.
The outpouring of tributes and re-
membrances that we have seen and will
see tonight is a testament to that fact.
Much has been said about the per-
sonal encounters Walter had with vet-
erans of the Iraq war and the families
of those who never returned and how
those encounters led him to reassess
his past and present policy cir-
cumstances.
Walter sent over 10,000 letters to fam-
ilies of fallen troops and he memorial-
ized those who died from North Caro-
lina’s Camp Lejeune with photos out-
side his office.
Walter’s determined and effective
voice for the military and especially
his beloved Marines and his deep love
for his home State of North Carolina
are going to be missed in these Halls
and in the coastal farming and mili-
tary communities in the Third Con-
gressional District.
So we express heartfelt condolences
to Walter’s wife Joe Anne, daughter
Ashley, his loyal staff who are joining
us in the Chamber here tonight, his
countless friends, neighbors and com-
munity members, the lives he touched
along the way.
Madam Speaker, I include in the
RECORD a tribute from one from his
longtime staff members, Ray Celeste,
Jr.
A TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSMAN WALTER B.
JONES
(By Colonel Ray Celeste Jr., U.S. Marine
Corps (Retired))
I had the pleasure and good fortune to have
served with Congressman Walter B. Jones for
almost eight years in his D.C. office as his
Military Legislative Assistant. He was an
American icon of virtue and American val-
ues. He loved America and his constituents
deeply. He worked tirelessly on their behalf
for many decades. He stood up against injus-
tices that many of them faced.
He had an iron-will to do what was best for
his constituents. His will was strong and un-
flinching. We, as part of his staff, worked to
ensure we represented the congressman as
best as possible and to be as helpful as pos-
sible to him and our constituents of the 3rd
District. His constituents’ services were re-
nowned.
Congressman Jones was the epitome of a
public servant. He was always working for
the betterment of his people. He was their di-
vine servant. He greatly appreciated the sac-
rifices our military veterans have made for
our great Nation.
He also appreciated the sacrifices their
families make. The general public sometimes
overlooks these sacrifices. He did a lot of
work in promoting the proper education of
military children who are autistic through
the use of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA).
Congressman Jones worked tirelessly to
help treat service members and Veterans
who suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Dis-
order (PTSD) and those that suffer from
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). He promoted
the use of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy
(HBOT). He did not think this was a cure-all
for PTSD or TBI, but as one of treatment
methods that that should be available to
service members and Veterans. He authored
a legislative provision that was adopted in
the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Au-
thorization Act (FY 2017 NDAA). This provi-
sion allows for the use of HBOT to be used as
a treatment method for PTSD/TBI by the
Department of Defense (DoD).
He was shocked at the overuse of drugs to
treat PTSD/TBI where there was no conclu-
sive clinical trial done that proved a certain
regime of drugs could cure or alleviate the
horrible mental and physical impacts of
PTSD/TBI. In some, if not many cases, it
made matters worse. He was shocked at the
over reliance on the use of drugs.
Congressman Jones looked for holistic
methods to treat PTSD/TBI such as the use
of service dogs. He also admired the positive
influence influences of yoga and combat acu-
puncture.
Congressman Jones was the Republican
lead on the legislation to honor Purple Heart
recipients and other American heroes by giv-
ing them access to Department of Defense
commissaries and recreation facilities. The
Purple Heart and Disabled Veterans Equal
Access Act of 2018 extends access to com-
missaries and Morale, Welfare, and Recre-
ation (MWR) facilities to Purple Heart re-
cipients, all veterans with a service-con-
nected disability, Medal of Honor recipients,
former prisoners of war, and veteran care-
givers. Commissaries are grocery/department
stores on military installations that sell
food and some household items. MWR facili-
ties offer a range of services on bases includ-
ing libraries, outdoor recreation, dining, golf
courses, and sports and fitness centers. It
was adopted in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).
Two words sum up Congressman Walter B.
Jones. He was highly principled and he was a
statesman. He thought we, as a Nation, must
look at what is best in the U.S.’s interests
first. He was not an isolationist, but he did
think the U.S. was allowing itself to be
taken advantage of by our allies.
Congressman Walter B. Jones was a once
in a lifetime member of Congress. God bless
him, his wife Joe Anne, and their daughter,
Ashley. Semper Fidelis.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I thank my colleague for
yielding.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I thank Mr. PRICE for his
comments.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. AMASH) for
his tribute to our good friend, Walter
Jones.
Mr. AMASH. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I can’t begin to tell
you how saddened I was at the passing
last month of my dear friend and col-
league, Walter Jones.
What a great man Walter was and
what a great loss to this institution.
Walter was one of my closest friends
in Congress. I wish I had been able to
spend more time with him, but I will be
forever grateful for the time that I did
spend with him.
I am glad I was able to attend his fu-
neral in North Carolina to say good-
bye and celebrate his life with his fam-
ily and friends. I am pleased to join
with my colleagues here today to do
the same.
Even though Walter was one of my
best friends, he would always refer to
me as ‘‘Chairman.’’ I used to think
that was because I was the chairman of
the House Liberty Caucus. Then one
day I realized that he would call all
sorts of people ‘‘Chairman,’’ so I asked
him about it, and he told me, ‘‘Every-
one is chairman of something.’’
Well, Walter, you were the chairman
of kindness, humility, dignity, courage,
integrity and honor.
Walter was one of the best men I
knew, a kind, humble, dignified man
dedicated to his faith, his family, and
the people he represented.
Walter had a courage and integrity
you rarely see in this chamber or any-
where. He never gave up fighting for
what he believed in. He wasn’t in Wash-
ington for money, power, or fame. He
cared about honor and doing the right
thing, and he was brave enough to
admit when he was wrong.
You were a good man, Walter, no
matter what you may have thought
about your mistakes. You were a good
man, chairman, and I will miss you.
May your memory be eternal.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I thank Representative
AMASH for his comments tonight.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2345
March 5, 2019
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. GABBARD).
Ms. GABBARD. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor the life of my
friend, Congressman Walter Jones, Jr.,
a man who was known by all of us
throughout his many years serving in
this chamber for his kindness, his
southern charm, and his big heart, his
fierce independence, and his pursuit of
peace.
Walter left us on February 10, his
76th birthday. He lived a long life of
service: four years in the North Caro-
lina National Guard, ten years in the
North Carolina General Assembly, and
nearly 25 years serving in these halls.
Walter stayed true to himself
throughout this time, following his
heart. He was never afraid to challenge
the status quo, often to the chagrin of
his party leaders.
We found a common bond and friend-
ship around shared ideals, of putting
people before politics, putting service
above self. He knew that when we see
each other as people, as public serv-
ants, not just as Republicans and
Democrats that this is when we have
the opportunity to find common
ground and work toward our common
goal of serving the people of this coun-
try.
Now, in 2002, Walter voted for the
Iraq war, the war that I served in, the
war that took the lives of my brothers
and sisters in uniform, the war that
took the lives of over 4,000 U.S. service-
members and over 100,000 Iraqis.
Walter shared with me, as he shared
with many others, that this vote that
he took was the biggest regret of his
time in public service.
He shared how when he attended a fu-
neral at Camp Lejeune for a 31-year-old
marine that was killed in Iraq in
March of 2003 while evacuating wound-
ed troops, everything changed for Wal-
ter, because he sat there and he heard
this marine’s widow, in front of their
three children, read the final letter
that this marine sergeant sent home,
and he saw those three kids, knowing
that they would never see their father
again.
This impacted him so deeply, and
maybe for the first time caused him to
realize the cost of war and who pays
the price. So Walter started writing.
He wrote over 12,000 letters to families
who lost their loved ones in both Iraq
and Afghanistan and shared how he
begged God to forgive him for his mis-
take.
He memorialized those who died from
North Carolina’s Camp Lejeune, as you
see here, with photos that he displayed
for all to see before they could come
inside his office here in Washington.
He became a leading voice not just in
his party, but in Congress, pushing for
additional oversight over matters of
war and peace. He called for ending il-
legal regime-change wars that put our
troops’ lives on the line, leaving their
families behind. He pointed out that
our taxpayer dollars should not be used
to be the policeman of the world.
Walter and I didn’t agree on many
things, but we also found many oppor-
tunities to work together on things
that we strongly believed in.
We cosponsored and co-led the No
More Presidential Wars Act, which
rightly put the responsibility back in
Congress’ hands to declare war, as the
Constitution provides.
He cosponsored my bill, the Stop
Arming Terrorists Act, to make sure
that taxpayer dollars are not being
used to directly and indirectly fund
terrorist groups, as we have seen done
in both Syria and Yemen.
We cosponsored the Weekend Voting
Act to strengthen voting rights.
We worked together to strengthen
civil liberties and privacy, upholding
our Fourth Amendment rights.
Walter was courageous. He didn’t
care about party politics, and as a re-
sult, he suffered the consequences in
tough primary elections, but he didn’t
care. He never hesitated to stand up for
what he believed in.
So while Walter and I were two very
different people coming from two very
different places, Walter was my dear
friend, fellow servicemember, and my
brother. He will be deeply missed.
My heart and prayers go out to his
family, his friends, and his loved ones.
We all know that Walter’s legacy of
service and his principles and values
will continue to live on in Washington,
in the Halls of Congress, and in the
lives of the many people who he
touched.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD), an-
other one of our colleagues.
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today, along with my col-
leagues, to remember and honor a
great, great public servant, a great
North Carolinian, devoted husband and
father, a man of great faith, and my
personal friend for over 40 years, Con-
gressman Walter B. Jones, Jr.
And, Madam Speaker, I emphasize
the word ‘‘junior,’’ because I knew Wal-
ter’s father and knew him very well,
for he was the Congressman for eastern
North Carolina for many years. And
though Walter did not use ‘‘Junior’’ in
his official name, he was indeed a jun-
ior.
Walter Jones passed away on Sunday,
February 10, 2019, on his 76th birthday.
He was a lifelong public servant,
serving in the North Carolina National
Guard for four years, the General As-
sembly of our State for ten years, and
the U.S. House of Representatives for
24 long years, where he served North
Carolina’s Third Congressional Dis-
trict.
b 1945
Since coming to Congress, I watched
Walter cast difficult votes with convic-
tion, standing firm in what he believed
was right for his constituents and for
the American people. That is why the
people of North Carolina’s Third Dis-
trict sent him back to Congress again
and again and again, electing him 13
times since 1994.
Even as Walter gained seniority in
the Congress, he maintained his strong
conscience and principles. As a senior
member of the House Committee on
Armed Services, Walter was an out-
spoken and effective voice for our mili-
tary.
Anyone in eastern North Carolina
who knew Walter Jones, or knew of
him, would know of his love for the
military. He was committed to safe-
guarding the well-being of our Nation’s
veterans and active servicemembers. In
fact, Congressman Jones sponsored and
cosponsored more veterans legislation
in the last three congressional terms
than any other sitting Member of Con-
gress.
Madam Speaker, it was one of the
greatest honors of my life for my
friend, Congressman Walter Jones, to
ask me to administer his oath of office,
which I performed at his Farmville
home on January 4, 2019. And I might
say that his home in Farmville is 20
minutes from my home in Wilson.
I am equally proud to say that a 30–
Member delegation traveled to Green-
ville, North Carolina, for the
homegoing service for Congressman
Jones. That 30–Member delegation was
led by the dean of our delegation, Con-
gressman DAVID PRICE, and the ranking
Republican among our delegation, Con-
gresswoman VIRGINIA FOXX.
I will miss Walter Jones in these
halls and in our beloved State. Walter
would drive home each week. We would
sit right here on the House floor each
Friday and talk about our weekends.
He would tell me how he was preparing
to drive home and how he dreaded the
traffic, but that he would offset the
dread of the traffic by listening to
audiotapes in his car while he would
drive.
Madam Speaker, we may have stood
on opposite sides of the aisle here in
the House, but there was always a mu-
tual respect and friendship between us.
I would say to the gentlewoman from
Hawaii who spoke a few moments ago
that he, too, called me Mr. Chairman. I
never understood exactly why he would
do that, but that was his vocabulary,
and I found it very honorable that he
would do that.
Although our friend is no longer
here, he has left an indelible mark on
eastern North Carolina, on the House,
and on the Nation. May our friend,
Congressman Walter B. Jones, Jr., rest
in peace and have eternal life with our
Father in Heaven.
To Joe Anne, Ashley, and all the
family and friends of Walter Jones, we
wish you God’s blessings in the years
to come.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from
eastern North Carolina (Mr. ROUZER),
my colleague.
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, many
in North Carolina and around the coun-
try are mourning the passing of our
friend and colleague, Congressman

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2346 March 5, 2019
Walter B. Jones, just as much as we
are. Our dear friend humbly served the
great people of eastern North Carolina
in the State legislature and in Con-
gress for more than 30 years. Having
known Walter for more than 23 years, I
can attest to his great faith in our cre-
ator and his servant’s heart.
Congressman Jones was elected to
Congress with the 1994 class, and it was
in his first term that I met him. I was
brand new to the Hill myself, working
for U.S. Senator Jesse Helms at the
time. Senator Helms and his wife, Dot,
quickly became great fans of Walter, so
much so—and many may not know
this—that even after Senator Helms
passed, Dot Helms would cut radio ads
for him up until her passing just a few
years ago.
What Dot and Jesse Helms admired
about Walter was no different than
what everyone else across the State of
North Carolina and throughout the
country who knew him admired: his
character, his adherence to his convic-
tions, and his commitment to serving
others.
He was a staunch advocate, of course,
for those who made the greatest sac-
rifice of all while serving our country.
He constantly worked on behalf of our
troops and veterans every single day,
especially those who were based in his
district at Camp Lejeune in Jackson-
ville and Cherry Point in Havelock.
Congressman Jones dedicated his life
to serving others. He stood strong for
his beliefs and even stronger for his
faith, always choosing to do what he
believed to be best for his constitu-
ency, our State, and our Nation.
The citizens of this State and coun-
try have lost a great friend whose life
made a real difference for so many. His
honesty, faith, and integrity will not
be forgotten.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I yield to the distinguished
gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. LAR-
SON).
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for
yielding, and I thank the dean of the
North Carolina delegation for putting
together this Special Order on behalf of
someone who truly epitomized the
word ‘‘gentleman,’’ indeed, ‘‘Southern
gentleman,’’ though not what you may
immediately conjure up if you are from
the North when you think about that
gentile Southern person and plantation
owner.
His father, who served in this body,
was a factory worker. Walter grew up
with great admiration for his dad, who
I was able to talk with him about on
several occasions on this floor.
What a special and unique place this
Chamber we serve in is, and through-
out history, how many people have
graced these hallowed halls and served
with distinction. Walter served not
only with distinction but with an acute
humility for what that service meant
and for the people he represented, most
notably, those at Camp Lejeune and,
has been alluded to already, the
thought process that Walter went
through in coming to the conclusion
that he must speak out and oppose a
war he had voted for. The very troops
that he nurtured, cared for, and felt so
much a part of, he felt honor bound
that he must speak on their behalf. He
could not withstand and was tortured
by the memory of looking at the little
boy who lost his father, knowing that
he would never know his daddy, as Wal-
ter would say.
I came in with Virginia in 1998. I
served on the Armed Services Com-
mittee with Walter. I was introduced
to him by a man from Mississippi
named Gene Taylor, who said that
there is more integrity in this man
than any Member of the United States
Congress. How right he was.
Walter would frequently come over
to the corner, as we referred to it, and
confer with Jack Murtha, my mentor
and arguably one of the most knowl-
edgeable people in this Chamber and in
this body on matters of defense, on
matters of the military, as he had
served as a colonel with distinction in
Vietnam. Walter would often probe Mr.
Murtha about the war in Iraq and how
bothered he was by that vote.
Jack would counsel him. When Wal-
ter would walk away, Jack Murtha
would add to the chorus of people who
would say: What honor, what integrity,
what thoughtfulness, what a genuine
human being Walter Jones is. He cares
so deeply about the people he rep-
resents and the feeling that he had not
done the right thing with his vote for
Iraq.
There are a number of reasons why
Jack Murtha came out to, ultimately,
oppose the war in Iraq. But I will al-
ways believe that Walter’s regular pil-
grimages over there to talk about the
rank-and-file soldier, about the person
on the frontline and their families be-
hind at home, and the fact that people
felt they were lied to, played an enor-
mous part in Mr. Murtha’s decision,
two profound figures that I had the
honor to serve with in this body, both
who have passed, both whose opposi-
tion to the war in Iraq changed the
course of events here in this country.
Walter, ever the gentleman, always
sincere, always humble, his friendship
and his acts of kindness are legendary.
I thank the dean of the North Caro-
lina delegation, who I hold in profound
regard, because I know he, and every-
body here tonight, cares deeply about
this institution. What makes this insti-
tution what it is, it is not the splendid
hall, but it is the humanity of people
like Walter Jones who have graced us
with his service and his presence, in-
deed, the people who bring honor and
dignity and integrity to the United
States Congress.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I yield to the distinguished
gentleman from California (Mr.
LAMALFA).
b 2000
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank
my colleagues, Ms. FOXX and Mr.
PRICE, both from North Carolina, who
have made this opportunity fittingly
available for all of us here tonight in
order to honor our friend, Walter
Jones.
I would always encounter him as a
low key but kind, gentle, sweet soul
that he is, around the building; and
just in his own way, just thumbs up,
keep going, encouraging in what we do
around here.
There were a lot of very kind re-
marks made about him here tonight
from people that got to serve with him
a lot longer than I did, but indeed, we
hear about how he was a very inde-
pendent voice. I think marching to his
own higher standard to what he felt his
own integrity required, not only as a
representative, as a person in this po-
litical business, but one who is answer-
ing to a higher power—the importance
of God in his life made abundantly
clear.
Indeed, at his service in North Caro-
lina, it really, really hit home for me
how much that was a part for him.
As we know, he was very, very un-
happy with the Gulf war. And after
that started, he really—I believe, and
the results show—he spent the rest of
his career trying to find and make and
provide comfort for the members of the
military—and even more so—the Gold
Star families, who he knows—and we
all realize—bear the loss the most
when one of theirs has fallen.
I heard that he would write to every
single Gold Star family when he would
learn of one of their loved ones having
fallen in conflict, that were killed in
action.
He would take his time in that posi-
tion as a Member of the United States
House of Representatives, using his
name, using that title and whatever
that carried, to provide comfort and
show those families that there are peo-
ple in this place that really, really do
recognize—we all do—but he went that
extra mile for people all over the coun-
try, not just in his district, to take
that care, to take that time. And I
thought that was pretty amazing.
Another way that he tried to help
was supporting the various programs
that were out there, to provide those
working dogs, a program I have en-
countered, to soldiers that have come
home that suffer with PTSD or similar-
type afflictions, that those comfort
dogs could provide something unique to
them that maybe no human contact
can reach for some of them.
He spent a lot of time, a lot of effort
in helping with that because he did
want to make as much of a positive
mark on those soldiers as possible.
Most importantly, though, his higher
calling he felt, it wasn’t here to put
treasures in this place or in his title. It
was the treasures he wanted to store in
Heaven, as he wanted to do what he
could to please God and walk with his
Savior Jesus Christ. And that is the
most important thing about Walter
Jones and his life and his devotion.
God bless him and his family and the
memory of him to this place.

Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from
California (Mr. LAMALFA), and I yield
as much time as he may consume to
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLU-
MENAUER).
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker,
I appreciate the gentlewoman’s cour-
tesy and my friend, Congressman
PRICE, in bringing us together.
I am standing in front of the chair
here on the floor that I routinely occu-
pied, and Walter sat next to me hun-
dreds of hours. It was fascinating
watching the dynamic on the aisle. I
think some people like to be on the
aisle because it is a place where people
come together.
I watched a parade of people in both
parties who would stop, greet him, and
talk about issues large and small, radi-
ating a sort of humanity that at times
is in short supply around here.
Walter epitomized what I think poli-
tics should be.
We talked often about how he was
creating problems for himself at home.
There is probably not a district in the
United States that is more oriented to-
wards the United States military, as
we have heard already.
He comes from a district that is in-
tensely patriotic and more than a little
Republican. Yet, he charted a path—
once he had determined that he had
made a mistake—he charted a path to
try and make it right, not just to the
Gold Star families, but to having that
interaction here on the House floor,
not in an accusatory fashion for people
who may have disagreed with him, but
just humbly focused on the human con-
sequences on the political foibles of
Congress.
He willingly took that burden on;
even though he knew that it could have
cost him his position in Congress. And
this is family tradition, as is men-
tioned, I mean his father before him. It
mattered a great deal to Walter to
carry that banner, to serve his con-
stituents and his State, but he walked
into that storm willingly because he
thought it was the right thing to do.
We don’t see a lot of that around
here, people who can face up to mis-
takes—which we all make. How many
of us have as graciously and publicly
acknowledged our mistakes, attempted
to make them right, and accept the
consequences?
Walter was a singular human being,
and I feel privileged to have sat next to
him all those hours.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from
Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER) for his com-
ments. And I now yield 3 minutes to
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOH-
MERT).
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I
thought it was appropriate, FOX News
had this headline: ‘‘Farewell to Rep-
resentative Walter Jones—a man who
lived his life putting people above poli-
tics.’’
Another headline from W. James
Antle: ‘‘Walter Jones and the Road Not
Taken.’’
Another from CBN News, Crystal
Woodall: ‘‘A Man of Faith, Honesty and
Integrity.’’
He was all of those. He, I guess,
manifested a bit of what Robert Frost
talked about when he said:
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
That was Walter Jones.
He was not going to take the easy
way. He was going to—and did—have
great integrity, great conscience, and
fulfilled his commitment to the people
in his district in North Carolina.
Those attributes, he would say, go
back to his Christian commitment. He
said on one occasion, There are some
documents you can’t rewrite, and
truthfully, one of them is the Bible.
He said, For over 15 years, I have led
the charge to return freedom of speech
to our churches and houses of worship.
During that time, I have spoken with
countless legal experts, and we believe
the clearest avenue to rectifying those
First Amendment rights is a full repeal
of the Johnson amendment.
He also said, America was built on
Judeo-Christian values, and these val-
ues should be protected. During my
years in Congress, I have been a stead-
fast supporter of traditional marriage,
the unborn, and the free exercise of re-
ligion.
Some people think that Christians
must hate everybody that disagrees
with them. And I think Walter Jones
was a living example of what a Chris-
tian should be.
With that conscience, with love, even
for those who hate, Walter had that
love. And I saw that that last day that
THOMAS MASSIE and I were with him.
God blessed America with Walter
Jones.
God blessed this body with Walter
Jones.
And God blessed me for having a
friend like Walter.
We miss you, Walter.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GOHMERT) for his extremely
eloquent remarks.
Madam Speaker, I yield as much
time as she may consume to the gen-
tlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR).
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman from North
Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for helping to or-
ganize this evening, as well as the dean
of the North Carolina delegation,
DAVID PRICE.
Truly, so many of us miss Walter
Jones among us already. And we thank
them for this Special Order, this order
to celebrate the honorable life and
service of the late Congressman Walter
B. Jones of North Carolina, a man of
deep conscience and integrity. His word
was his bond.
Madam Speaker, it is with a sense of
true sadness, but abiding gratitude,
that I rise tonight to join all of you as
we pay tribute to our cherished friend
and colleague, Walter, and offer sin-
cerest condolences to his beloved wife,
Joe Anne and daughter Ashley, to their
friends, to their family, to his constitu-
ents in North Carolina, and friends
across the country.
I also rise this evening in memory of
his father, Walter Jones, Sr., with
whom I had the privilege to serve when
I was first elected to the Congress.
We both shared a great interest in
maritime commerce. And so when Wal-
ter arrived in Congress, it was my
great privilege to serve with his son.
So I was able to serve with Walter
during his entire quarter century of ex-
emplary service here in the House.
And, yes, he was a man of deep con-
science in an era of utter distraction.
He exemplified exceptional honor,
kindness, and a steady conviction that
always stayed true.
I brought with me today a book Wal-
ter gave me entitled, ‘‘Extortion’’ by
Peter Schweizer. And in it Walter in-
scribed the following message:
Marcy, may those of us who serve in the
U.S. House work together to return the
House to the people and not let ‘‘special in-
terests’’ continue to influence policy. Thank
you for your friendship. God bless America.
Walter Jones.
At the time Walter wrote these
words, he and I had been talking about
a bipartisan effort to clean up Congress
using our joint efforts, traveling to ap-
propriate venues along the way to ad-
vance reform of our democracy, and get
big money out of politics.
But as the months went by, it be-
came clear that Walter would not be
able to make this journey, and he bore
his wounds with great dignity and in
silence.
What a man of courage.
Walter, as others have said, had a
deep passion for the people he rep-
resented—surely, the Marines of Camp
Lejeune and their families and col-
leagues, as these photos attest.
He would always take to this House
floor to compassionately recall their
patriotic service. He never, ever forgot
them.
The war in Iraq weighed so heavily
on him, and his integrity required him
to speak out. And he did, often.
His constituents knew the measure of
this committed, modest man of ster-
ling conviction.
b 2015
Walter is held in highest esteem by
his colleagues on both sides of the
aisle, and he will be sorely missed.
A grateful nation thanks the people
of the Third Congressional District of
North Carolina, and I know all of his
constituents join us in thanking Wal-
ter for his decades of public service and
his family for all of their sacrifices be-
cause he so conscientiously and self-
lessly dedicated himself to our Nation.
He was true; he was reflective; he was
faithful; and he was a patriot. His spir-
it lives right here. I can feel it myself
as a beacon across this Congress and as
a shining star for all to come with in-
tegrity and moral conviction.

May God bring comfort to his family,

move through this period of deep
mourning and come into the sunlight
again.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for
her comments.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO).
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman from North Carolina
for yielding.
As I look at Walter here, it reminds
me when I came to Congress in 2013,
my first term here. Walter was one of
the first people who befriended me.
We had, over the course of several
Congresses, many, many good laughs.
He was always quick to laugh. He was
always gentle, strong in his conviction,
and he wouldn’t hesitate to hold you
accountable.
Every time I went on a codel, he
would scold me for spending the tax-
payers’ money. When the codel went to
go to his funeral, I said, if I went on
that codel, Walter would roll over in
his grave and yell at me, and so I chose
not to go just to honor him on that.
He would give you the shirt off of his
back and help you in any way he could.
There was a Christmas ball, and I had
to have a date for my daughter because
she came up here. I took my wife, and
I called Walter. He said: ‘‘I don’t want
to do that, but for you, I will do that.’’
That is the kind of friend he was. And
he walked my daughter in there so that
she got to go.
He cared about God, country, his
family, the people who serve this great
Nation, and the people in his district.
He was held in high esteem, as was
evidenced the day when THOMAS
MASSIE and LOUIE GOHMERT gave the
eulogy here in the talk about Walter.
That was the quietest this Chamber
had ever been without the Speaker
having to interrupt.
He was always fun to have a joke
with or laugh, and we had many. His
team is back here, faithfully to the
end. Next time we are at a reception,
we will have a red wine and a cigar in
Walter’s favor.
I thank the gentlewoman for doing
this, and I thank you, buddy, Walter
Jones, for the things you did for us.
God bless.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his
comments.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAS-
CRELL), a long-serving Member and an-
other respected Member of this body.
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, to
VIRGINIA FOXX and to DAVID PRICE, I
would expect you two to be here. I real-
ly would.
To the gentleman and the gentle-
woman and to the staff, I sat quietly in
the back, but I know what you felt
about Walter Jones. I say thank you to
you for serving him as he served you
and all of us.
In a moment when our Nation cries
out for principled leadership, the loss
of Walter Jones is especially difficult.
The challenges we face right now really
demand the wisdom of men and women
like Walter Jones. The absence of his
voice in our Chamber is devastating.
Walter Jones was a real patriot. He
was gentle but persistent. He was fer-
vent but not self-indulged. He was a
real winner.
Our tenures in this place overlapped
almost completely, so I had the pleas-
ure of working closely with Walter
many, many times.
There is no Member I have served
with, man or woman, Democrat or Re-
publican, old or young, who was more
forthright or was more courteous or
kind. He was revered for his generosity
because that is exactly who he was.
Walter was my friend, and I was his
friend. We had been leading an effort,
both of us, to get Congress to reassert
its prerogatives and apply oversight of
the executive branch of government.
Walter stood up by himself for this.
If operating in the minority was a
lonely crusade for us, imagine how it
was for Walter to cast those votes all
by himself. He understood the song we
sing many times on Sunday, ‘‘Be Not
Afraid.’’ He was not afraid, but for Wal-
ter Jones, it was just another day at
the office.
Walter made a career standing up by
himself, guided solely by what he
thought was the right thing, and he
was often punished for it. He was
stripped of political clout and prestige
for his independence.
He was a person of faith who re-
spected all faiths. We were all equal in
Walter’s eyes and in Walter’s heart.
What a lesson. So it is important to
understand what that really entails.
There may be nothing more difficult
than standing alone. We see every day
here how challenging it is for men and
women to stand up when everyone else
is lined up against them. So even when
you know a position, a vote, an act is
right, to do it alone takes immense
confidence, courage, and unswaying
principle.
Walter Jones embodied those quali-
ties as much as anyone who has served
in the people’s House. There was only
one Walter Jones, and we have lost
him. We could use a lot more like Wal-
ter. He was not a photo op. He was the
real thing.
Thank you. Thank you for your gra-
cious friends who came tonight to
speak about you, and it was from ev-
eryone’s heart. I hope that Congress
learns something.
Thank you, Walter.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from
New Jersey for his eloquent comments.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. TONKO) for
his comments.
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman from North Carolina
for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I thank the dean,
the gentleman from North Carolina, for
bringing us together. The delegation
has done an awesome bit of tribute
here to recognize Walter B. Jones, Jr.,
our colleague who has served so faith-
fully well. I will offer a few comments
here. It has been a tremendous tribute.
I do, in my initial comments here,
want to extend my condolences to his
widow and his family and his many
friends and colleagues and, in a par-
ticular way, to his staff.
To know Walter Jones is to love Wal-
ter Jones. I have to believe that the re-
lationship that he had with so many
and, in particular, his family and his
extended family, his work family, had
to be driven by that love, that compas-
sion that was part of him. It was unde-
niable. It was so clearly presented by
every step, every thought he shared.
He was a person of deeply rooted
faith. His Christian faith, his Catholic
faith guided him. He was a pious indi-
vidual who was not self-righteous but
spoke with such integrity and such
deeply rooted beliefs that our goal in
life is to connect inextricably with ev-
eryone and to serve everyone.
He understood the role of a legislator
to be compassionate, to empathize, to
be able to express to the many people
who trusted in his leadership, to share
what needed to be done here.
And so, tonight, we gather together
to offer our thanks to this consummate
gentleman who was every bit of the
way, yes, an individual of greatness,
but if we do not mention his heart, his
kindness, we don’t capture the indi-
vidual.
His kindness worked in several ways.
He wove that kindness into every bill
that he addressed, every vote he under-
took, every step that he made in his
career of public service. He understood
that these acts of kindness would accu-
mulate to express an individual of
greatness.
His integrity was impeccable. I cher-
ish the many conversations we would
have on the walk over to the House or
in riding in the trolley about having a
sense of guidance, a sense of how to
conduct yourself, how to go forth and
understand that the work you can ad-
dress in this body affects individuals so
greatly.
Obviously, he was a person who was
humble and could acknowledge mis-
takes, as was indicated earlier, to do
that publicly and graciously as he did
when he suggested that the many thou-
sands, the 12,000-plus letters that he
had drafted to families of dead troops
since 2003 was, in a sense, an act of pen-
ance, a sense of expression that he had
erred and that he regretted that there
were these consequences of war that
were borne by these many families who
lost their loved ones prematurely.
There was a sense of coming together
that he would allow all of us to share
in the efforts for peace. Walter carried
himself in a peaceful way, a peaceful
manner. He was a moral compass for
this House, one who taught us, by his
very actions, that it is essential for us
to be bold, that our fight to be there
for what is just and fair should guide
us.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2349
March 5, 2019
Tonight, I acknowledge his great
work, his great friendship, his great
lessons taught. He didn’t use or need to
use words to teach us. His actions
spoke louder than any words he could
utter. And tonight, we say thank you
to an individual who is very much
missed already in the weeks that have
passed since his departure from this
world.
Walter, we cherish your memory. It
will live forever. You will be the meas-
uring stick for Members who serve in
this House, and you will be that con-
stant reminder, as I look at that kind
and loving smile that you have worn in
this photograph that we have on dis-
play on the House floor. It has guided
us. It will continue to speak to us.
Your actions are powerful. Your
words were so carefully chosen and so
heartfelt. Your drive to be a just and
fair man has earned you an eternal re-
ward. Good job, humble and faithful
servant.
God bless you. May you rest in peace.
b 2030
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I thank Mr. TONKO for those
words.
Madam Speaker, as we sometimes
say here to keep from using up time we
shouldn’t use, I want to associate my-
self with all the comments made by my
colleagues.
Walter was all of the things that our
colleagues have talked about. He had a
fantastic Southern charm and a fan-
tastic smile. He was humble; he exhib-
ited acts of kindness; and he was pious,
not self-righteous.
I regret, as others have said, that I
didn’t take more time to spend with
him. But I think even in Walter’s
death, he has done something we talk
about doing here and that is to bring
the House together on an issue.
We are here to honor a very extraor-
dinary man who did what his con-
science told him to do, and he some-
times suffered the consequences. But I
think tonight exhibits that doing the
right things for the right reasons will
be honored and has been honored to-
night.
I thank, again, all the Members who
came here tonight to speak on Walter’s
behalf. We all benefited from that.
I particularly thank the dean of our
delegation, DAVID PRICE, who was a
longtime friend of Walter B. Jones, Jr.
I thank his assistant, Gloria Nlewedim,
for her great assistance in this.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that
all Members may have 5 legislative
days in which to revise and extend
their remarks and include extraneous
material on the subject of my Special
Order, because I know there are Mem-
bers who wish to insert their comments
because they could not be here.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from North Carolina?
There was no objection.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I would ask Mr. PRICE if he
has any closing comments he would
like to make.
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I thank my colleague for pre-
siding over this remarkable series of
tributes. It has been a memorable
evening—more than I could have an-
ticipated—in the array of colleagues
who have paid tribute and in the kind
of emotions stirred in all of us, I think,
by the memory of a good friend and a
good man, but also a sense of the val-
ues and the affection that binds us to-
gether here.
It is too bad, perhaps, that it took an
occasion of this sort to bring this out.
But I will never forget it, and we will
never forget Walter Jones and what he
meant to all of us, so I thank the gen-
tlewoman so much.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I again thank Mr. PRICE for
his contribution to this evening, and I
agree with the gentleman. It is unfor-
tunate sometimes that it takes a death
to bring out these kinds of comments
and this kind of camaraderie. We must
remember tonight and practice it more
often.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay
tribute to our colleague Walter Jones, who
passed away last month. Walter was my
friend. Ever collegial and kind, he saw this in-
stitution for the good it could do for his con-
stituents and for our country.
I admired Walter for his candor and for his
patriotism. Over the years, I watched him
make very difficult decisions, take very difficult
votes. He did so out of principle. He stood up
for what he believed.
It’s no surprise that Walter had so many
friends on both sides of the aisle. And it’s no
surprise either why the people of North Caro-
lina’s coastal communities sent him back to
Congress election after election. Those of us
who served with him could also see the ex-
traordinary love he had for his wife Joe Anne
and for their daughter Ashley.
We will miss Walter Jones in this House. I
will miss my friend. We all are better off for
having served with him, and this House and
this country are better off for his service.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor the life of my friend and
colleague, Walter Beaman Jones, Jr., who
passed away on February 10, 2019 at the age
of 76. His passing is a deep loss to this insti-
tution, and we miss him dearly in the House
of Representatives. Walter was proud to rep-
resent North Carolina’s 3rd congressional dis-
trict, a geographically diverse district, for over
24 years and always found a way to address
the concerns of his coastal constituency as
well as his rural inland residents.
Those who knew Walter remember a tena-
cious, earnest and passionate Member of
Congress, who tirelessly fought for what was
right. Throughout his 24 years in Congress,
Walter represented his district and constitu-
ents with a passion and intensity that I think
we each strive to emulate. He followed a
moral compass that rarely took him off course.
In the rare event that it did, he did not let him-
self off the hook and dedicated his life and ca-
reer to right any wrong. Walter was known for
saying: ‘‘I would rather do what I think is right
than to sell my political soul.’’
Walter spent much of his career in Con-
gress serving on the Armed Services Com-
mittee. In this capacity, he stood up for military
families, investigated corruption within the De-
partment of Defense, and was relentless in his
pursuit to bring our troops home from Iraq.
Walter sent over 12,000 letters to families who
had lost loved ones overseas and gave over
150 floor speeches to clear the names of two
Marine Corps pilots who were unfairly blamed
for a deadly military accident. He was also
passionate about renaming the Department of
the Navy to the Department of the Navy and
the Marine Corps to better reflect the service
and sacrifice of our Marines. Walter was one
of the most independent voices in Congress.
He was never afraid to vote against his party
or President if it was what he thought was
best for his constituents, his district, and the
nation.
I had the opportunity to work closely with
Walter on several legislative initiatives. He
was the lead Republican cosponsor of the
Youth Promise Act, a comprehensive juvenile
justice bill that I first introduced in 2007. We
were proud to have core provisions of the
Youth Promise Act included in the Juvenile
Justice Reform Act passed by Congress and
signed by President Trump late last year. We
also worked together on legislation to protect
the mid-Atlantic coast from offshore drilling.
Madam Speaker, the House of Representa-
tives lost one of its most dedicated public
servants last month. We were all lucky and
privileged to know and work with Walter
Jones. I join my colleagues in expressing our
sympathy to Walter’s wife Joe Anne, his fam-
ily, many friends, and constituents for their
loss.
Mr. HOLDING. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the life and legacy of my good friend
and former colleague, Congressman Walter B.
Jones.
For nearly a quarter century, Walter Jones
served his country and the people of North
Carolina with steadfast dedication, conviction,
and integrity.
A man of deep faith, Walter Jones’ kindness
and servants heart earned him the affection of
all who knew him.
In Washington, Walter Jones was a rare
breed who truly broke the mold. He was an
independent-minded public servant who rose
above the trappings of partisan politics and
political parties to vote his conscience, no
matter the consequences.
Lucy and I send our heartfelt prayers and
deepest condolences to his wife Joe Anne, his
daughter Ashley, and the entire Jones family
during this difficult time.
Our nation and the state of North Carolina
are better off today because of Walter Jones’
principled and steadfast public service. I will
forever be honored to call Walter my friend
and colleague.
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in honor of my colleague, Representative Wal-
ter Jones, Jr.
For 24 years, Congressman Jones rep-
resented the people of North Carolina’s 3rd
Congressional District with pride and integrity.
In his quarter century in service to our great
country, Congressman Jones was a steadfast
voice and advocate for North Carolina.
He was unafraid to put people before poli-
tics. He was a dedicated public servant.

And he was a principled leader.
He stood firmly for what he believed—and
wasn’t afraid to admit when he made a mis-
take.
2 Corinthians 5:8 reminds us that ‘to be ab-
sent from the body is to be present with the

I pray that my friend has now found the
peace he sought.
To his wife, Joe Anne, and his daughter,
Ashley—please know that Walter left an indel-

TWO WOMEN, TWO PLACES
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. FOR-
TENBERRY) for 30 minutes.
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speak-
er, before I begin my remarks, let me
thank my colleagues, Congresswoman
VIRGINIA FOXX and Congressman DAVID
PRICE, for their beautiful, moving trib-
utes to our colleague, Walter Jones.
I wasn’t an intimate friend of Wal-
ter’s, but we did have a friendship.
Each encounter that I had with him
was special because he always had an
eye toward that which was higher,
noble, and good.
I heard some of the sentiments Mem-
bers expressed, heartfelt sentiments of
loss, but also a great tribute and honor
to this extraordinary man who did try
to rise above the difficulties and the
tensions here. I think both his life and
his death taught us invaluable lessons,
and frankly, I think it is what the
American people are longing for from
this body as well. So I thank the gen-
tlewoman very much for doing this.
Madam Speaker, tonight, I would
like to talk about two women, two
women from very different places, two
women from very different cultures
and different religions, two women
with very different stories. Together,
these two women, differently and sepa-
rately, are reinterpreting in light of
what was so that they can imagine
what will be.
The first woman’s name is Nadia
Murad. Nadia won the Nobel Peace
Prize in 2018. I know Nadia. She is a
Yazidi from northern Iraq. The Yazidis
are a people bound by an ancient faith
tradition, and they have sought to live
in peace in very harsh surroundings
through the centuries. Along with the
Christians of the area, they have en-
dured many persecutions for a very
long time. But nothing could have pre-
pared Nadia for what happened on Au-
gust 15, 2014.
Nadia lived in a little village called
Kawju in an area called Sinjar, again,
in northern Iraq. The town’s residents
were mostly farmers and shepherds. At
21 years old, Nadia dreamed of owning
her own hair salon and becoming a his-
tory teacher. But then the unthinkable
happened.
The Islamic State, ISIS, invaded her
village. ISIS rounded up everyone and
forced them into the schoolyard. The
men were then separated from women.
As Nadia told us, she said that she
never realized how small her village
was until she saw all of them in that
schoolyard.
They stood huddled on the dry grass.
Some whispered to one another, won-
dering what was going on. Others were
silent, in shock. No one understood
what was happening, as Nadia said to
us.
Nadia was then forced to watch as six
of her brothers were massacred. Her
mother was executed along with 80
other older women. The bodies of the
men and women were then thrown into
mass graves.
The rest of the women, including
Nadia, were taken to Mosul, the largest
city held by ISIS at that time, and
they were sold. They were sold as sex
slaves.
The depravity of ISIS further un-
folded as they sought to carry out a
genocide, a complete extermination of
Christians, Yazidis, and other religious
minority traditions in that area. The
Yazidis were singled out for persecu-
tion by ISIS because they were part of
a Kurdish-speaking religion without a
holy book.
Using that background as justifica-
tion, what was called the ISIS Re-
search and Fatwa Department targeted
women for sexual slavery in an effort
to lure young men into joining their
cause. ISIS’ twisted bureaucracy of
barbarity even prepared a document on
this, and it was called ‘‘Questions and
Answers on Taking Captives and
Slaves.’’
True to the dictates of the ISIS docu-
ment, Nadia was bought and sold sev-
eral times, with Facebook used as one
of the prime ISIS marketing tools. She
was repeatedly raped, burned with
cigarettes, and beaten. At one point,
she attempted to escape, but she was
caught. The vicious gang rape that
then ensued left her unconscious. She
decided not to try to escape again.
After months of unspeakable agony,
one day, Nadia discovered that a door
had been left unlocked, and she fled.
She found refuge with a Muslim family
who willingly helped her. In fact, the
eldest son, at great personal risk, took
her in his car and got her to the Kurd-
ish lines where she was safe.
I was first introduced to Nadia by
some friends in Lincoln’s Yazidi com-
munity. Through an interesting con-
vergence of things, Lincoln, Nebraska,
which is my home, has the largest
Yazidi population in America. Many of
the young men had served as our trans-
lators during the height of the Iraq
war.
Interestingly, one of the first pieces
of legislation that I worked on was to
give special visas accommodating peo-
ple to come to America who had risked
their lives alongside our troops, some
of whom died, and they were given spe-
cial status to come here. Many have
made their home in Nebraska, and I am
very proud of that.
When Nadia came to see me, I could
sense the trauma in her face and the
wounds in her soul, so I tried to gently
ask Nadia if she would be willing to
share her full story with those of us
there in my office. I told her that I
thought it was important that we hear,
in order to try to understand, but only
if she wanted to. She again gently an-
swered back that, yes, she would share
her story.
She walked us through her night-
mare. At one point, I looked over at
her Yazidi translator. Tears streamed
down his face. My own chief of staff
sobbed. It was just too much to bear.
But in a real moment of pride for me,
Madam Speaker, 1 month ago today,
Nadia Murad was my guest right here
in the House Chamber for the State of
the Union. I was happy to see her
again, and she gave me a copy of her
book called ‘‘The Last Girl.’’ Her fiance
was with her, Abid Shamdeen. What a
gentle young man. He had served as
well as a translator at the height of the
Iraq war and had earned his citizenship
to America.
Before the State of the Union event,
Nadia and I spent about an hour with a
reporter from The Washington Post.
The beautiful gift of watching her
interact with this reporter was this:
She answered the questions clearly,
with great grace and purposeful re-
solve, as Abid lovingly stood by her
and translated her words and the full
meaning of them.
She was in Washington to raise
awareness of the Yazidi genocide and
join us in the call for a new type of se-
curity settlement in northern Iraq that
would protect the ancient mosaic, the
ancient tapestry of religious pluralism
that once existed there, including
Christians and Yazidis, as well as cer-
tain Islamic minority traditions.
While that was her primary motive
before that reporter and us, again, she
gently and profoundly articulated the
need to respect human dignity. She
used that pain in her soul to project
healing on our broken world.
Madam Speaker, when I first came to
Congress, an older Member warned me
about something. He called it the tyr-
anny of the urgent. He said to be care-
ful of the tyranny of the urgent, be-
cause what that will do is subsume you
into emergency after emergency with-
out leaving any time for reflection, for
thought, for dialogue, for relationship.
We see that played out day after day,
and, of course, the media begs this as
issues switch and controversies arise,
and we are all summoned to give var-
ious opinions on whatever negative
thing just happened. The tyranny of
the urgent, we have to be careful of
that because it robs us of the chance to
sit with a heroic woman like Nadia and
listen carefully to what she has to say.
This hour-by-hour D.C. and 911 fire
alarm is distracting us from this essen-
tial work of reflection and authentic
governance. It is true now more than
ever.

HOUSE
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2351
March 5, 2019
A lot of what goes on here is outside
the glare of television. Recently, I had
the chance to engage the Adminis-
trator of the United States Agency for
International Development who had
come before the House Appropriations
Subcommittee on State, Foreign Oper-
ations, and Related Programs. I talked
to him about a number of issues that
were important to me: the country of
Haiti, the prospects for reforestation
around the world, conservation, the
story of Nadia and so many Yazidis,
and this need for the new security set-
tlement in northern Iraq.
b 2045
The American people are generously
helping with economic aid, under the
leadership of the Agency for Inter-
national Development, to help poten-
tially create the conditions in which
Yazidis and Christians could return
and once again flourish.
This was foremost in my mind as I
spoke with the administrator in the
committee hearing. But I told the ad-
ministrator this, that the name—the
name itself, the United States Agency
for International Development—really
does not capture the fullness of the
mission of what we are trying to do.
Ultimately, this mission and our dis-
position, as reflected in policy, ought
to be about one thing expressed in two
words: human dignity—protecting
human dignity and, in doing so, at-
tacking the root causes of poverty and
attempting to create for the 21st cen-
tury an imaginative architecture for
diplomatic relations, again, rooted in
authentic service to America’s human-
itarian impulse, creating the condi-
tions for international stability which
are inextricably intertwined with our
own national security.
This is a properly oriented foreign
policy trajectory of our Nation, and,
again, it is based on the idea that
America’s impulse is to be charitable,
America’s impulse is to help—yes, to
demand responsibility but, also, to help
create the conditions in which human
life can flourish.
This has profound meaning, Madam
Speaker, where I live, particularly in
Nebraska, because one of the ways in
which we express, in practical terms,
that humanitarian impulse is through
agricultural policy. We feed ourselves,
and we feed the world.
Nebraska has a big role in doing just
that, and this is true now more than
ever in our modern age. The land has
been the source of our vitality in
America.
Particularly where I live but, really,
across the country, agriculture is so es-
sential to our economic well-being, our
life, our way of life, our culture, to who
we are as a people.
And again, where I live, production
agriculture is so essential, in corn and
soybeans and livestock that cover
much of our landscape. They are an im-
portant part of America’s export prow-
ess.
The farm communities’ and the
ranch communities’ efficiency, their
quality, their ingenuity allows us to
provide food security for tens of mil-
lions of vulnerable people in America
and abroad, while ensuring that Ameri-
cans enjoy the lowest per capita gro-
cery bills in all the world.
Now, the challenge and the oppor-
tunity is to grow America’s farm fam-
ily. And to look to the future, we
should look to the past to see, again, in
this new century, a new connection
starting to occur between the urban
and the rural.
This diversification of our farm fam-
ily is happening rapidly, and so we, im-
portantly, are no longer talking in the
language of producers and consumers
but, rather, in terms of connecting the
farmer to the family.
You can now meet your farmer at the
local farmers market. That is a level of
intimacy not seen since the early days
of agriculture in America.
What is at stake here, Madam Speak-
er, is this desire to bring people closer
to their food and into an authentic re-
lationship with those who grow that
food.
Agriculture is creating an exciting
new entrepreneurial space, and we have
seen a real uptick in young people en-
tering the ag field. Young people are
being drawn to agriculture through ex-
citing new niches, including artisanal
foods and crops, organics, and the
farm-to-fork movement.
Agricultural studies no longer sit off
on the side in their own silo. They are
inextricably intertwined, an intimate
relationship with environmental
science and conservation, as well as
international development.
Restaurants that focus on locally
sourced foods are also growing in popu-
larity, and with that trend comes an
increased interest in the food of indige-
nous peoples—all exciting new spaces.
Still, at the heart of Nebraska and at
the heart of America is the traditional,
large-scale American farm.
At the beginning of this, Madam
Speaker, I talked about two women.
And we have heard about Nadia Murad,
who is living with a deep wound yet
seeking ways to rebuild what once was
a thriving tradition.
I want to talk about another woman
I recently met now, though, a fas-
cinating young woman who has merged
the millennial sense of authentic con-
nection with a traditional production
ag operation.
Hannah Esch is an agricultural stu-
dent at the University of Nebraska in
Lincoln and a Nebraska beef ambas-
sador.
Hannah was surprised when she re-
cently visited some young children in a
classroom in one of our counties and,
when asked a basic question about
where food comes from, a third grader
answered that eggs come from cows
since they are next to the milk in the
grocery store. This alarmed Hannah a
bit, but it reinforced Hannah’s desire
to go deeper into ag education and out-
reach.
Hannah is a specialty livestock pro-
ducer with a fascinating background as
an agriculture pioneer. She is a part of
a growing movement of young agricul-
tural entrepreneurs. She is a pas-
sionate advocate for production agri-
culture, while also seeking emerging
niche opportunities.
In Nebraska, the average age of the
farmer is 58 years old. I don’t know ex-
actly what it is across the country,
Madam Speaker, but I assume it is
somewhat similar.
What we have on our hands is, on the
horizon, a generational transfer. But
there is also an interesting conver-
gence of amazing new opportunity on
that same horizon.
Two dynamics are on the verge of
breaking out: small-scale farm produc-
tion and the nimble, innovative use of
technology in agriculture.
I met Hannah at an ag pioneers event
organized by the Agribusiness Entre-
preneurship program at the University
of Nebraska.
The businesses of these cutting-edge
ag leaders range from organic popcorn
production to ag tech in the Internet of
Things. Others were leaders in the
farm-to-table movement, boutique veg-
etable growers, and specialty livestock
sellers. Some were large grain pro-
ducers experimenting with cover crops
that would enhance the soil and also
advance their own innovation in the
precision agriculture space.
Not everybody in this room was
young. Not everybody came from farm
families, interestingly. But what they
shared was a passionate desire to add
value to traditional production agri-
culture and create the space for a new
food movement that is showing tre-
mendous potential.
Of course, at that meeting, given this
body recently passed a new farm bill,
an important piece of legislation that
does basically one thing—provides food
security in two ways: The risk manage-
ment policies that protect agriculture
producers from the vagaries, the ups
and downs, of weather, the supply prob-
lems as well as other difficulties that
arise in ensuring that a timely, good
harvest is delivered, that is the purpose
of the farm bill, combined with its
other purpose, to help those who are in
food-vulnerable circumstances through
our nutrition programs. We discussed
the policies embedded in the farm bill,
including the value-added grants sec-
tion and the assistance that we give to
beginning farmers and ranchers.
Another of the participants were the
Brugger brothers. They were engaging
young people who could honestly,
Madam Speaker, star in a reality TV
show.
They are adding enormous value to
the farm commodities they produce.
These twins not only distill corn and
raise cattle; they create a sequence of
value across multiple agricultural
products, from hops to whiskey to fin-
ished meats. Their vertical integration
puts the value in the value chain—in
their pocket. That is an exciting entre-
preneurial place to be.
These brothers, however, are about
more than food. They also want to lure

members of their younger generation
back to the small town. They want to
build community around artisanal ag-
riculture.
This connectivity around food is one
of the value propositions that I wanted
to highlight here that Hannah holds so
dear. She has grown her own premium
brand of beef through the power of
story.
Using Instagram and photos and
video, Hannah sells her livestock prod-
uct directly via the Internet to a di-
verse range of customers from around
the country who yearn to know the
provenance of their food.
Hannah draws interest in her beef by
showing the life cycle of her cattle,
and, through compelling use of social
media, she invites customers into the
intimate process of livestock produc-
tion. Her market, again, is to a world
hungry for the authentic story behind
what is for dinner.
Madam Speaker, with Hannah and
other ag pioneers, we are experiencing
a bit—or the front end, should I say?—
of an emerging set of ideas that will
help shape our social and economic
well-being for this century. It is the en-
trepreneurial drive that these young
people possess to be stewards of the
land, to grow the ag family, and to cre-
ate the space for genuine food relation-
ship.
This millennial-driven movement
signifies an embrace of the traditional
human-scaled model of agriculture for
which our society is yearning, while re-
maining firmly within and adding to
the mainstream of production agri-
culture that feeds America and feeds
the world.
So what do Hannah and Nadia hold in
common? I think they are connected.
They are from very different lands.
They speak different languages. They
have different cultural mores.
What they are driving for is meaning
around human dignity. Whether it is
Nadia, who has suffered the horrible
loss of her family and her extraor-
dinary tradition—she is being driven
by a purpose to pull out of that tragedy
deep meaning and projecting that on
the world, speaking to our hearts clear-
ly through her suffering about the need
for human dignity.
It is our only way out, to express and
rebuild our systems of governance, our
foreign relations, and our economics
around this idea of interconnectedness
with respect for human dignity. It is a
very important driver, even in the life
of an entrepreneur like Hannah, who
seeks, again, the authenticity of food
relationship. I think there is an inti-
mate connection here between two
women from two very different, far-
away places.
Madam Speaker, my wife was telling
me recently—and I venture out here a
little bit because I don’t know the
name of this art form. It is my under-
standing there is a type of porcelain
that is very, very delicate and fragile;
and, if it should break, it is actually
repaired by gold so that, as beautiful as
the original piece was, it becomes more
vibrant, more offering. Its brokenness
shows more beauty.
In listening to Nadia and her deep
woundedness and watching her young
fiance lovingly escort her through the
storytelling of her wounds to the
world, it is that porcelain being re-
paired by gold, and it shines all the
more beautifully.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

ant to notice or subpoena.

ceive three calendar days’ written notice (ex-

seek a ruling from the Chair either by tele-
phone or otherwise. If the Chair of the Com-
mittee overrules any such objection during
the deposition, the witness shall be ordered
to answer. If following the deposition’s re-
cess, the Chair of the Committee overrules
any such objection and thereby orders a wit-
ness to answer any question to which a privi-
lege objection was lodged, such ruling shall
be filed with the clerk of the Committee and
shall be provided to the members and the
witness no less than three days before the re-
convened deposition. If a member of the
Committee appeals in writing the ruling of
the Chair, the appeal shall be preserved for
Committee consideration. A deponent who
refuses to answer a question after being di-
rected by the Chair in writing, or orally dur-
ing the proceeding as reflected in the record,
may be subject to sanction, except that no
sanctions may be imposed if the ruling of the
Chair is reversed by the Committee on ap-
peal.

transcribed or electronically recorded or
both. If a witness’s testimony is transcribed,
the witness or the witness’s counsel shall be
afforded an opportunity to review a copy. No
later than five days after the witness has
been notified of the opportunity to review
the transcript, the witness may submit sug-
gested changes to the Chair of the Com-
mittee. Committee staff may make any ty-
pographical and technical changes. Sub-
stantive changes, modifications, clarifica-
tions, or amendments to the deposition tran-
script submitted by the witness must be ac-
companied by a letter signed by the witness
requesting the changes and a statement of
the witness’s reasons for each proposed
change. Any substantive changes, modifica-
tions, clarifications, or amendments shall be
included as an appendix to the transcript
conditioned upon the witness signing the
transcript.
(k) Transcription Requirements. The indi-
vidual administering the oath, if other than
a member, shall certify on the transcript
that the witness was duly sworn. The tran-
scriber shall certify that the transcript is a
true record of the testimony, and the tran-
script shall be filed, together with any elec-
tronic recording, with the clerk of the Com-
mittee in Washington, D.C. Depositions shall
be considered to have been taken in Wash-
ington, D.C., as well as the location actually

nority Member of the Committee shall be

deposition at the same time.

and Ranking Minority Member of the Com-
mittee shall consult in advance regarding
the release of deposition testimony, tran-
scripts, or recordings, and portions thereof.
If either objects in writing to a proposed re-
lease of a deposition testimony, transcript or
recording, or a portion thereof, the matter
shall be promptly referred to the Committee
for resolution.

ness shall not be required to testify unless

of the Federal agencies and entities having
responsibilities in or for the administration

diction which it intends to be effective dur-
ing that fiscal year.

ticable after a concurrent resolution on the
budget for any fiscal year is agreed to, the
Committee (after consulting with the appro-
priate committee or committees of the Sen-
ate) shall subdivide any allocations made to
it in the joint explanatory statement accom-
panying the conference report on such reso-
lution, and promptly report such subdivi-

olution (or both) to the House or submit such
recommendations to the Committee on the
Budget, in accordance with the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974.

mittee action which shall include—

count of remarks actually made during the
proceedings, subject only to technical, gram-
matical, and typographical corrections au-
thorized by the person making the remarks

PUBLICATION OF BUDGETARY
MATERIAL
STATUS REPORT ON CURRENT SPENDING LEVELS
OF ON-BUDGET SPENDING AND REVENUES FOR
FY 2019 AND THE 10-YEAR PERIOD FY 2019
THROUGH FY 2028
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET,
Washington, DC, March 5, 2019.
Hon. NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: To facilitate appli-
cation of sections 302 and 311 of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974, I am transmitting
an updated status report on the current lev-
els of on-budget spending and revenues for
fiscal year 2019, and for the period of fiscal
years 2019 through 2028. This status report is
current through February 25, 2019. The term
‘‘current level’’ refers to the amounts of
spending and revenues estimated for each
fiscal year based on laws enacted or awaiting
the President’s signature.
Table 1 compares the current levels of
total budget authority, outlays, and reve-
nues to the overall limits filed in the Con-
gressional Record on May 10, 2018, for fiscal
year 2019 and for the 10-year period of fiscal
years 2019 through 2028. These comparisons
are needed to implement section 311(a) of the
Congressional Budget Act of 1974, which es-
tablishes a rule enforceable with a point of
order against measures that would breach
the budget resolution’s aggregate levels. The
table does not show budget authority and
outlays for years after fiscal year 2019 be-
cause appropriations for those years have
not yet been completed.
Table 2 compares the current levels of
budget authority and outlays for legislative
action completed by each authorizing com-
mittee with the limits filed in the Congres-
sional Record on May 10, 2018, for fiscal year
2019 and for the 10-year period of fiscal years
2019 through 2028. These comparisons are
needed to enforce the point of order under
section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget
Act of 1974, which prohibits the consider-
ation of measures that would breach the sec-
tion 302(a) allocation of new budget author-
ity for the committee that reported the
measure. It is also needed to implement sec-
tion 311(c), which provides an exception for
committees that comply with their alloca-
tions from the point of order under section
311(a).
Tables 3 compares the current status of
discretionary appropriations for fiscal year

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2362 March 5, 2019
2019 with the section 302(b) suballocations of
discretionary budget authority and outlays
among Appropriations subcommittees. The
comparison is needed to enforce section
302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974
because the point of order under that section
equally applies to measures that would
breach the applicable section 302(b) sub-
allocation. The table also provides supple-
mentary information on spending in excess
of the base discretionary spending limits al-
lowed under section 251(b) of the Balanced
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act
of 1985.
Table 4 displays the current level of ad-
vance appropriations in fiscal year 2019 ap-
propriations bills. All of the advance appro-
priations are for accounts identified pursu-
ant to H. Res. 6 and the statement of the
Chairman published in the Congressional
Record on January 8, 2019. This table is need-
ed to enforce a rule against appropriations
bills containing advance appropriations that:
(i) are not identified in the statement of the
Chairman published in the Congressional
Record on January 8, 2019 or (ii) would cause
the aggregate amount of such appropriations
to exceed the level specified in section 103(c)
of H. Res. 6.
In addition, a letter from the Congres-
sional Budget Office is attached that sum-
marizes and compares the budget impact of
legislation enacted after the adoption of the
budget resolution against the budget resolu-
tion aggregates in force.
If you have any questions, please contact
Jennifer Wheelock.
Sincerely,
JOHN YARMUTH,
Chairman.

a Sections 1001–1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P. L. 114–255) require that certain funding provided for 2017 through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services—in particular the Food and Drug Administration and
the National Institutes of Health—be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) or the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Therefore, the amounts
shown in this report do not include $781 million in budget authority, and $770 million in estimated outlays.
b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the House, the resolution, as approved by the House of Representatives, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a
result, current level does not include those items
c In the House of Representatives during the 115th Congress, pursuant to section 5111 of H. Con. Res. 71, the budgetary effects of legislation that affects the Federal Reserve’s surplus funds are excluded from current level totals. As a
result, the amounts shown do not include estimated increases in revenues of $655 million in fiscal year 2019, $570 million over the 2019–2023 period, and $455 million over the 2019–2028 period.
d Division I of P.L. 115–254 provided $1,680 million in supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2019, and designated those amounts as being for emergency requirements pursuant to section 251 of the Deficit Control Act. In general,
the budgetary effects of authorizing legislation are recorded as direct spending or revenue. However, consistent with the language in division I, and at the direction of the House Committee on the Budget, those budgetary effects are clas-
sified as discretionary spending.
e The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116–5), as amended, extended several immigration programs through February 15, 2019, that would otherwise have expired at the end of fiscal year 2018. The estimated budgetary effects
of those previously enacted extensions are charged to the Committee on Appropriations, and are included in the budgetary effects of P.L. 116–6 shown in the ‘‘Appropriation Legislation’’ portion of this report. In addition, division H of P.L.
116–6 further extended those same programs through the end of fiscal year 2019. Consistent with the language in title III of division H of P.L. 116–6, and at the direction of the House Committee on the Budget, the budgetary effects of
extending those immigration programs for the remainder of the fiscal year are charged to the relevant authorizing committees, and are shown in the ‘‘Authorizing Legislation’’ portion of this report.
f In the House of Representatives, and pursuant to section 314(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, amounts designated as an emergency requirement shall not count for purposes of title III and title IV of the Congressional
Budget Act of 1974, and are excluded from current level totals. In addition, emergency funding designated that was not designated pursuant to the Deficit Control Act does not count for certain budgetary enforcement purposes. Those
amounts, which are not included in the current level totals, are as follows:
Budget

Outlays Revenues
Discretionary Emergency Requirements:
Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act, 2018 (P.L. 115–254, Division I) ............................................................................................................. 1,680 25 0

Total, Discretionary Emergency Requirements .................................................................................................................................................................... 1,680 35 0
g Section 30104 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115–123) required—in the absence of a concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2019 that the Chair of the House Committee on the Budget publish the aggregate
spending and revenue levels for fiscal year 2019; those aggregate levels were first published in the Congressional Record on May 10, 2018. P.L. 115–123 also allows the Chair of the House Committee on the Budget to revise the budg-
etary aggregates:

Article I, section 8, clause 4 of the Con-

found that this provision of the Constitution
grants Congress plenary power over immi-
gration policy. As the Court found in Galvan
v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 531 (1954), ‘‘that the for-
mulation of policies [pertaining to the entry
of aliens and their right to remain here] is
entrusted exclusively to Congress has be-
come about as firmly imbedded in the legis-
lative and judicial tissues of our body politic
as any aspect of our government.’’ And, as
the Court found in Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408
U.S. 753, 766 (1972) (quoting Boutilier v. INS,
387 U.S. 118, 123 (1967)), ‘‘[t]he Court without
exception has sustained Congress’ ‘plenary
power to make rules for the admission of
aliens and to exclude those who possess
those characteristics which Congress has for-
bidden.’

tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).
f
PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Sovereign Lord, You are our refuge
and strength. We look to You for
mercy and grace.
Send to our lawmakers the power and
grace they need today to glorify Your
name in all they do. Lord, give them
the purity of heart that will shut the
doors to all evil. Keep their feet in the
path of integrity that they may walk
securely. Develop in them a persever-
ance which refuses to leave any task
half done. Empower them with a dili-
gence to offer You no less than their

We pray in Your powerful Name.
Amen.

CONCLUSION OF MORNING

EXECUTIVE SESSION
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report.
The bill clerk read the nomination of
Allison Jones Rushing, of North Caro-
lina, to be United States Circuit Judge
for the Fourth Circuit.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1
minute as if in morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
THE GREEN NEW DEAL
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
would like to make a point about the
so-called Green New Deal. It is very ob-
vious it is a reference to Franklin Roo-
sevelt’s New Deal in the 1930s. The im-
plication is that what the New Deal did
for the Depression should be a model
for the environment.
There is just one great big problem:
The New Deal in the 1930s didn’t work.
It didn’t get us out of the Great De-
pression. The Depression didn’t end
until we entered World War II.
Just like the original, the Green New
Deal sounds like really bold action, but
it is really a jumble of half-cocked
policies that will dampen economic
growth and will hurt jobs.
Everything our government ought to
be trying to do is to encourage eco-
nomic growth and to create jobs.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
I ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
NOMINATION OF ALLISON JONES RUSHING
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
yesterday the Senate voted to advance
the nomination of Allison Jones Rush-
ing to serve on the Fourth Circuit
Court of Appeals.
As I noted yesterday, Ms. Rushing
comes with significant appellate expe-
rience and has filed 47 briefs in the U.S.
Supreme Court. It is clear to me, as it
was to a majority of our colleagues on
the Judiciary Committee, that she
would make a fine addition to the Fed-
eral bench. So I will support her con-
firmation later today, and I rec-
ommend that each of our colleagues do
the same.
NOMINATION OF CHAD A. READLER
Madam President, following Ms.
Rushing, the Senate will consider Chad
Readler of Ohio to serve on the Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Readler
is a two-time graduate of the Univer-
sity of Michigan, earning his J.D. with
honors in 1997. Following law school,
he held a clerkship on the Sixth Circuit
and has built a longstanding reputa-
tion in private practice as a consum-
mate legal professional.
Mr. Readler is also active in pro bono
work, including for the United Way of
Central Ohio, and his nomination
earned a ‘‘well qualified’’ rating from
the American Bar Association.
So I look forward to advancing yet
another of President Trump’s impres-
sive judicial nominees later this week.
H.R. 1
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, this week the House will be devot-
ing floor time to the Democrat politi-
cian protection act. That is what I call
the signature effort that Speaker
PELOSI has given top billing—top bill-
ing—as H.R. 1, because this new House
Democratic majority’s top priority is
apparently assigning themselves an un-
precedented level of control over how
they get elected to Washington, along
with how, where, and what American
citizens are allowed to say about it.
That is their priority No. 1.
Over there, across the Capitol, more
than anything else, Washington Demo-
crats want a tighter grip on political

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1636 March 5, 2019
debate and the operation of elections
nationwide. But the Democrat politi-
cian protection act is just part of a trio
of massive, unprecedented government
takeover schemes that Democrats have
already rolled out just this Congress.
On its face, this proposal might seem
less outrageous than Medicare for None
or the so-called Green New Deal. It
wouldn’t seem to impact the middle-
class families as directly as making
private health insurance plans illegal
or sending the U.S. economy on a nose-
dive in the name of tackling carbon
emissions while China goes roaring
right by.
Here is the thing. Those two pro-
posals are just terrible policy. Bad pol-
icy can be stopped or undone through
the political process, but H.R. 1 isn’t
just terrible policy. It is an attempt to
rewrite the underlying rules of that po-
litical process itself and skew those
rules to benefit just one side—that
side.
By every indication, the Democratic
politician protection act is a massive,
partisan solution in search of a prob-
lem. Democrats want to convince ev-
eryone that our Republic is in crisis,
but when you scratch the surface of
these scare tactics, their two main
complaints seem to be that Democrats
don’t win enough elections, and people
Democrats don’t like also happen to
have First Amendment rights.
Just look at the data. In 2016, turn-
out reached its third highest rate since
the 1960s. Turnout was very high. By
the sheer number of Presidential bal-
lots cast, an all-time record was set,
and these numbers were hardly a fluke.
Last November, the midterm turnout
rate set a new 50-year record for off-
year elections.
Nevertheless, the Democrats are in-
tent on fixing our elections even
though they aren’t broken. Their solu-
tion amounts to a hostile, one-sided
takeover of the electoral process with-
out—without—the input of both par-
ties.
In the Democrats’ view, our fed-
eralist system, in which State laws
evolve to address unique challenges, is
old-fashioned and no longer to their
liking. Now it is time for sweeping new
decrees from Washington.
What each State has found works
best for them to register voters or to
maintain voter rules—all of that is now
supposed to yield to what Washington
Democrats want.
It starts with a massive influx of gov-
ernment data to the registration rolls.
In one sweep, all of the duplicative and
conflicting data from across State and
Federal Government Agencies—as well
as colleges and universities—would
flood the voter registration system—
flood it.
This isn’t the slightly tested, auto-
matic voter registration some States
have installed with the DMV. This is a
massive data dump that is sure to in-
vite risk of inaccuracy and a loss of
privacy. It is especially concerning, as
the Democrats want to mandate that
agencies register 16- and 17-year-olds.
What about things like one-size-fits-
all online voter registration, where the
simple safeguard of signing a document
can be easily side-stepped? Or a manda-
tory new one-stop registration and vot-
ing procedure in every State, without
the assurance of verifying the voter’s
identity or address before adding their
ballot to the ballot box?
If your State requires even the
loosest voter ID requirement, the
Democrats’ bill would undermine it.
Everything down to the type of paper
the ballot is printed on is dictated by
Washington Democrats under their
proposal. The list goes on and on.
Now you might think that with
Democrats insisting that every locality
subscribe to ever looser registration
standards, they must provide strong
tools for verification and maintenance
of the voter rolls. Think again. In fact,
they seem more focused on taking
away these safeguards.
The bill leaves States with less abil-
ity to maintain voter records and to
ensure that people aren’t registered in
multiple States. In many instances, it
seems the Democrats want more iden-
tification required to correct an erro-
neous voter entry—listen to this: more
identification required to correct an
erroneous voter entry—than to register
a new voter. In other words, it is hard-
er to get off the rolls than it is to get
on the rolls.
What if we look at the problems that
actually exist? What about the murky
‘‘ballot harvesting’’ process that in-
vites misbehavior? It was already ille-
gal in North Carolina, where a congres-
sional election result was thrown out
recently due to fraud, but the practice
that threw out the election in North
Carolina just the other day remains
perfectly legal in California, where it
seems to benefit, amazingly enough,
the Democrats. Somehow, for all of the
other top-down changes that H.R. 1
would force on the country, somehow
addressing ballot harvesting didn’t
make the cut. Imagine that.
It is almost like Democrats’ purpose
here is not promoting integrity but,
rather, preserving the chaos that would
make close elections ripe targets for
their DC lawyers to contest. The law
itself suggests as much by creating new
private rights of action—new private
rights of action—for trial lawyers to
ramp up litigation when they are un-
happy with an outcome.
Now as I mentioned, elections aren’t
the only focus. Democrats are also
coming after America’s political
speech. Under H.R. 1, a newly partisan
Federal Election Commission would be
empowered with sweeping—sweeping—
new authority to regulate speech that
is deemed to be ‘‘campaign related.’’
New rules apply to the mere mention
of a politician’s name. There are new
limitations on advocacy groups to
speak on substantive issues and strict
new penalties for when private groups
of citizens cross the lines that Wash-
ington Democrats have drawn.
But it doesn’t stop there. Protecting
Democrat politicians is hard work—
hard work, indeed—and it requires a
multipronged approach. So not only
does H.R. 1 deploy stricter regulations
on political speech; it also ramps up re-
quirements when private citizens en-
gage in it. Even small expressions of
First Amendment rights could require
extensive documentation, and in many
new cases, forced public disclosure of
your private activities would be re-
quired.
So we are in a dangerous climate for
the robust exchange of ideas. There is
outright government bias like we saw
from Lois Lerner’s IRS. There are ac-
tivist-driven online mobs that come
after individuals’ reputations and their
livelihoods. This is not—I repeat, this
is not—a climate where the people’s
representatives should be rushing to
make more of Americans’ private in-
formation public.
The ACLU is not often an organiza-
tion that would be described as bipar-
tisan—not always—but here is what
the ACLU wrote in a letter to House
Democrats just a couple of days ago:
There are . . . provisions that unconsti-
tutionally impinge on the free speech rights
of American citizens and public interest or-
ganizations . . . [the bill] strikes the wrong
balance between the public’s interest in
knowing who supports or opposes candidates
for office and the vital associational privacy
rights guaranteed by the First Amendment.
That is the ACLU. They go on:
[H.R. 1] interferes with that ability by im-
pinging on the privacy of these groups, forc-
ing the groups to make a choice: their speech
or their donors. Whichever they choose, the
First Amendment loses.
This is the very issue that the
NAACP had to sue the State of Ala-
bama over way back in the 1950s. They
won a critical victory when the Su-
preme Court confirmed that the First
Amendment is eroded when Big Broth-
er forces private organizations to pub-
licize the people who work to support
them—the NAACP v. Alabama, in the
1950s.
It was true in the 1950s, and it re-
mains true today, but that erosion is
exactly what House Democrats want to
achieve. It is what they want to
achieve. Their bill even supports a con-
stitutional amendment to take away
First Amendment protections.
Even if their proposal does chill the
exercise of the First Amendment—fear
not—House Democrats have a plan to
make sure there is still plenty of activ-
ity come election season. It is a tax-
payer-funded stimulus package for
campaign consultants and political
candidates. They are going to take
your tax money and give it to can-
didates you oppose to buy commer-
cials, buttons, balloons, bumper stick-
ers with your tax money. Democrats
want to sign taxpayers up to a six-
times matching subsidy for certain po-
litical contributions. It could total
about $5 million in taxpayer money—$5
million in taxpayer money—for every
candidate who wants it. What a great
idea—right into the pockets of polit-
ical campaigns—your tax money.
That is what these guys want to pass.

privilege of watching television com-
mercials attacking their own beliefs
and the candidates they support and
knowing their own tax dollars bought
the airtime for candidates they oppose.
All of this is what House Democrats
are debating on the floor this very
week—H.R. 1—all of this and more. I
have only scratched the surface of the
Democratic Politician Protection Act:
running roughshod over States’ and
communities’ control of their own elec-
tions, regulating and chilling the
American people’s exercise of the First
Amendment, forcing taxpayers to indi-
rectly donate to the politicians they
don’t like, and a dozen other bad ideas
to boot.
Behold the signature legislation of
the new House Democratic majority.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
just briefly, I heard my good friend, the
Republican leader, decry H.R. 1. He
called it the Democratic protection
act. Well, if making it easier for people
to vote and getting Big Money out of
politics hurt the Republican Party and
is good for Democrats, what a sad com-
mentary on the Republican Party that
they don’t want to see people vote,
make it easier to vote, and that they
don’t want Big Money out of politics—
a sad commentary on the Republican
Party to be afraid of H.R. 1.
NOMINATION OF CHAD A. READLER
Madam President, later this after-
noon, the Senate will vote to take up
the nomination of Chad Readler to be a
judge on the Sixth Circuit. Mr. Readler
was the man behind the curtain last
year when the Trump administration
decided to side with Texas and 19 other
States with Republican attorneys gen-
eral in suing to repeal our healthcare
law. Mr. Readler didn’t merely work on
the case; he was the lead lawyer who
filed the Justice Department brief de-
claring the administration would
refuse to defend the laws of our coun-
try.
His recommendations were so out-
rageous that many career Justice De-
partment attorneys refused to sign it.
Mr. Readler argued that protections for
Americans with preexisting conditions
should be eliminated. Let me repeat
that. The nominee up for a vote later
this afternoon argued that protections
for Americans with preexisting condi-
tions should be eliminated. Then, a day
after Mr. Readler filed this awful brief
hurting average Americans—hurting
tens of millions of average Ameri-
cans—he was nominated for a lifetime
appointment on the Federal bench. Co-
incidence? I think not. You see, in the
Trump administration, depriving peo-
ple of protections for preexisting condi-
tions is actually something to be re-
warded. Shame. Shame on the Trump
administration. Shame on anybody
who votes for Mr. Readler, particularly
those who claim they want to protect
preexisting conditions. Those who say
they want to protect them and vote for
the chief cook and bottle washer who
pulled them away and was given this
nomination the next day, shame on
them.
During the past campaign, as I said,
many Republicans stood up and said,
rightly, that they supported keeping
protections for Americans with pre-
existing conditions. That is all well
and good, but that is what is so typical
of our Republican friends in the Sen-
ate. They talk the game that we do—
they are for more healthcare, they are
for protecting Americans with pre-
existing conditions—but their votes on
the floor of the Senate are exactly the
opposite. It is all well and good to say
you want to protect them, but those
promises and pronouncements mean
next to nothing if they will not vote to
reject a lifetime appointment for the
man who played the starring role in
the legal effort to take these condi-
tions away.
Republicans who vote yes on Mr.
Readler, I believe, will regret that vote
in future years. A vote to confirm Mr.
Readler is an endorsement of the Re-
publican lawsuit to eliminate protec-
tions for preexisting conditions and re-
peal healthcare for millions of Ameri-
cans.
DECLARATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, the national emergency. It seems
with each passing day, another Repub-
lican comes out to oppose the Presi-
dent’s declaration of a national emer-
gency at the border. Over the weekend,
Senator RAND PAUL, who often speaks
his own mind, became the fourth Re-
publican to officially announce his sup-
port for terminating the President’s
emergency declaration, apparently
guaranteeing enough votes for passage
in the Senate. I hope and expect that
Senator PAUL will not be the last Re-
publican to announce their support be-
cause this should be an issue that tran-
scends party. The President’s emer-
gency declaration gnaws at our very
fabric, particularly the separation of
powers. The President—this Presi-
dent—is trying to bend the law to his
will, to accrue powers that are not his.
There is no evidence that some new
emergency exists at the border. The
President himself has said he ‘‘didn’t
need to do this.’’ An emergency, by def-
inition, is something that you need to
do. Everyone here knows the truth.
The President didn’t declare an emer-
gency because there is one. He declared
an emergency because he lost in Con-
gress, threw another temper tantrum,
and wanted to go around it. That, my
friends, is a gross abuse of our con-
stitutional system.
Article I—not article II, the execu-
tive branch article, not article III, the
judiciary branch article, but article I,
Congress—gives Congress the power of
the purse, not the President. Were we
to permit an Executive—any Execu-
tive—to declare an emergency every
time they lost in Congress, what would
be the point of Congress? We would be
trading our democracy for a monarchy,
the very thing our Framers abhorred
and that our Constitution guards
against. Remember, back then, why did
the colonists—the brave colonists—
rebel? It was against the overreaching
power of King George. They said: We
need a government that is going to pro-
tect us from the overreaching power of
any individual, particularly one em-
powered to lead a nation. That is why
they did it. It is relevant today. Donald
Trump has shown more desire to over-
reach than any President. Some people
may like that, but it goes against 200
years of wisdom in this country, and I
hope people will reject it.
Whatever you think of the policy at
the southern border—I suppose Senator
PAUL is very much for the wall—no
President should be allowed to discard
the Constitution on a whim and do an
end run around a coequal branch of
government.
This vote on the resolution to termi-
nate this emergency is not a vote
about policy, it is not a vote about
party. It is a vote about Presidential
power and the precedent it will set,
which will reach far beyond the current
debate about the border. The debate
about the border will be forgotten, but
the fact that this Congress, this Sen-
ate, allows a President to so overreach
and rearrange singlehandedly the bal-
ancing blocks in our democracy will be
regarded by historians as a bleak day.
I say to my colleagues, that doesn’t
just apply to how you vote. It applies
to whether we have enough votes to
override the President should he veto
this resolution when it passes.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Madam President, on climate, Leader
MCCONNELL has spent a great deal of
time talking about bringing his version
of the Green New Deal to the floor. Ev-
erybody knows it is nothing more than
a political stunt. Everybody knows the
same Republican leader decried bring-
ing bills to reopen the government be-
cause the President wouldn’t sign
them, and he said those were stunts.
Now he is doing the same thing. It is
amazing sometimes that there can be a
180-degree turn so quickly.
So let’s talk about some of the things
Leader MCCONNELL could actually do
to move the ball forward on climate
change, which now more and more peo-
ple—two thirds of Americans, if you be-
lieve in polling—believe is a real threat
to our planet that demands the Sen-
ate’s action, not stunts, not games.
All 47 Democrats have introduced a
resolution that affirms three simple
things; one, climate change is real;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1638 March 5, 2019
two, climate change is caused by
human activity; and, three, Congress
must immediately act to address the
problem. Leader MCCONNELL could
bring that resolution to the floor. He
could say he believes climate change is
real and deserves our time and atten-
tion. Given the rampant denialism
from some wings of the Republican
Party, including so many in the White
House, that would be notable progress,
but I don’t think it will happen.
You scratch your head and wonder
why. Why would they be so afraid to
even say climate change is real? One
possible answer many people think is
the cause, one of the main causes, is oil
money—oil money. The oil industry
has such power around here—and much
of that money is dark, by the way—
that Republicans are afraid to admit
the candid truth and say climate
change is real.
Our resolution doesn’t talk about
how you propose to deal with this very
real issue. We are not locking people
into this proposal or that proposal. We
are simply saying, let’s start talking
about it. Actually, the one good thing
about Leader MCCONNELL’s stunt is we
are talking about it, and that is a good
thing. I have news for the leader. We
will keep talking about it throughout
this whole Congress, and we will keep
trying to use our leverage to make it
easier to resist the bad forces of carbon
dioxide entering our atmosphere.
So we are going to keep at this. We
are going to keep at this, Leader
MCCONNELL. No stunt that you put on
the floor is going to deter us. We are
preparing legislation to defund Presi-
dent Trump’s attempt to create a fake
climate panel within the executive
branch. Leader MCCONNELL can bring
that legislation to the floor once it is
ready so Congress can tell the Presi-
dent that we do not tolerate the inten-
tional dissemination of disinformation
to the American public on any issue,
especially climate change.
Democrats have also said any infra-
structure bill must include substantial
investments in green jobs. That is
something Leader MCCONNELL could
pursue. We all like jobs. Many Mem-
bers on his side of the aisle believe in
wind and solar power—well, not many
but at least some. Let’s move forward
on that. We need to upgrade our power
grids. We need to make energy more
available and cheaper and greener.
Let’s do that.
There are many more things besides,
but make no mistake, before and after
Leader MCCONNELL’s political stunt on
climate change, Democrats will con-
tinue to focus on the issue, propose so-
lutions, and try to get some of those
solutions enacted into law in the places
we have some leverage, even as a mi-
nority.
There is an enormous energy—enor-
mous energy in this country, particu-
larly among young Americans—to take
bold action on climate change. They
see the planet on which they live
changing before their eyes, not for the
better, and they are absolutely right.
It is our job to channel the energy of
those young people—wonderful energy;
I am so glad it is out there—into bold
legislation that addresses the climate
crisis head on, and that is exactly—ex-
actly—what Democrats will do, even if
Republicans continue to play these po-
litical games in their efforts to try to
keep their heads in the sand and ignore
that climate change is real.
CHINA
Madam President, finally, on China,
recent news reports have described an
emerging trade deal with China that
would see the United States ease up on
tariffs in exchange for the Chinese buy-
ing more American goods and making
some—some changes to its trade prac-
tices.
As the New York Times reports this
morning, ‘‘The agreement does not ap-
pear to require the sweeping changes to
China’s economy that prompted Mr.
Trump to begin the trade war.’’ If the
reports about the emerging agreement
are accurate, I would say to President
Trump, you are heading down a precar-
ious road.
The President’s instincts were right
when he took a hard line on China. I
supported his hard line on China. China
is killing us in terms of stealing our in-
tellectual property, in terms of not let-
ting American companies compete fair-
ly in their large market while they are
allowed to come here, in terms of not
creating a level playing field for com-
panies no matter what country they
are from.
The President was right when he said
we have to do something about it. In
fact, as he began on this road, he did a
lot more than previous Presidents.
Both President Bush and President
Obama did less to get China to under-
stand the seriousness of this problem
than President Trump did. He knows
that.
When you are getting close to a vic-
tory, to relent at the eleventh hour
without meaningful, enforceable, and
verifiable structural reform to China’s
trade policies would be an abject fail-
ure of the President’s China polices,
and people will shrug their shoulders
and ask, what the heck did he begin
this for if he will not complete it?
We need to put an end to the forced
transfer of American technology and
American know-how as a ransom for
doing business in China. We need to put
an end to China’s systemic theft of
American intellectual property. A big
hack from China was found out just
last month. Our companies need the
same unfettered access to China’s mar-
kets that we allow Chinese firms to
have to markets in America.
This may be our last shot. If the
President squanders his own efforts
now, there will be lasting and untold
consequences for generations to come.
The President is too focused on trade
imbalances. That is short term. Those
come and go. The reason our trade bal-
ance is so bad is because of all of the
structural things China does to make
it harder for us to export to China and
easier for them to import here after
stealing a lot of our know-how. A tem-
porary narrowing of the trade deficit
would be cold comfort to the millions
of American workers who have suffered
and will continue to suffer the abuse of
China’s policies.
When the President was headed to
North Korea, I said to him: When it
comes to North Korea, don’t let March
go in like a lion and come out like a
lamb.
The President did the right thing on
North Korea, and I got up here and said
that he did. He backed out when the
North Koreans wouldn’t give him much
and resisted the opportunity of a photo
op, which we know is hard for him to
resist. He should do the same thing on
China.
He got a lot of credit for backing out
on North Korea. The President will get
a lot of credit if he stands up to China
and will eventually win because the
Chinese economy is hurting. They just
reduced their own biased estimates on
growth. It is lower.
My plea to President Trump is this:
Stand firm. We will win this fight that
you correctly began, but don’t back off
for some temporary salve. America’s
future depends on it. The income of our
workers and the number of good-paying
jobs we create all depend on our stand-
ing tough with China right now when
we sort of have them where we want
them and completing a strong deal.
Please, Mr. President, don’t back off.
When it comes to China trade and your
actions, don’t let March come in like a
lion and go out like a lamb.
I yield the floor.

THE ECONOMY
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, last
week, we learned that the economy
grew at a rate of 3.1 percent from the
fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth
quarter of 2018. That is the strongest
economic growth in over 10 years. Eco-
nomic growth for the fourth quarter of
2018 smashed market expectations.
In January, the economy created
more than 300,000 jobs. More than 5.3
million jobs have been created since
President Trump was elected. Job
openings hit a record high of 7.3 mil-
lion in December, substantially exceed-
ing the number of those looking for
work. The Department of Labor reports
that the number of job openings has ex-
ceeded the number of job seekers for 10
straight months. Unemployment is
low. January marked the 11th straight
month that unemployment has been at
or below 4 percent. That is the longest
streak in nearly five decades.
Wage growth has accelerated. Wages
have now been growing at a rate of 3
percent or greater for 6 straight
months. The last time wage growth
reached this level was in 2009. Median
household income is at an alltime high.
U.S. manufacturing has rebounded.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1639
March 5, 2019
America’s factories are hiring again.
After years of job losses, U.S. manufac-
turing employment has risen for 18 straight
months among those holding production or
nonsupervisory jobs, the longest stretch of
gains since the mid-1990s.
That is from the Wall Street Journal.
The list goes on.
The economic growth we are experi-
encing is the direct result of Repub-
lican policies. Economic growth has ac-
celerated over the past 2 years, thanks
to the lifting of the burdensome regula-
tions and a historic reform of our Tax
Code.
Before we passed the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act, our Tax Code was acting as a
drag on economic growth. Small busi-
nesses faced heavy tax burdens that
frequently made it difficult for them to
expand and create jobs or even to get
their businesses off the ground in the
first place. America’s global businesses
faced the highest corporate tax rate in
the developed world, which put them at
a competitive disadvantage on the
international stage.
Of course, all of that had real con-
sequences for American workers. A
small business owner facing a huge tax
bill was highly unlikely to be able to
expand her business or to hire a new
employee. A larger business was going
to find it hard to create jobs or im-
prove benefits for employees while
struggling to stay competitive against
foreign businesses paying much less in
taxes. So we reformed our Tax Code to
make it easier for businesses to grow,
create jobs, and expand opportunities
for American workers. Now we are see-
ing the results—economic growth, low
unemployment, higher wages, a record-
high number of job openings, and more.
Importantly, the benefits of this
growth are being experienced widely.
The Wall Street Journal reports:
Racial minorities, those with less edu-
cation and people working in the lowest-pay-
ing jobs are getting bigger pay raises and, in
many cases, experiencing the lowest unem-
ployment rate ever recorded for their groups.
They are joining manufacturing workers,
women in their prime working years, Ameri-
cans with disabilities and those with crimi-
nal records, among others, in finding im-
proved job prospects after years of dis-
appointment.
Again, that is from the Wall Street
Journal.
The Obama administration was char-
acterized by a weak recovery and years
of economic stagnation. There were
predictions that 2 percent growth
would be the new normal. But Repub-
lican economic policies have turned
the economy around. Now we need to
focus on ways to extend the benefits of
tax reform even further and to secure
the gains we have made for the long
term.
Unfortunately, our colleagues across
the aisle are more focused on disman-
tling the policies that created the
growth we are experiencing today. Ap-
parently, it doesn’t matter to them
that workers are doing better after
years of economic stagnation or that
jobs and opportunities are increasing.
They are set on dismantling tax reform
and raising rates to fund their socialist
fantasies. They want to spend $93 tril-
lion—more money than the GDP of the
entire world—to put the government in
charge of Americans’ healthcare, en-
ergy usage, and more.
I wish I were joking, but Democrats’
turn toward socialist insanity is all too
real. The kinds of tax hikes that would
be required to pay for Democrats’ pro-
posals would cripple our economy and
severely downgrade America’s standard
of living—not to mention robbing
Americans of their freedom to make
their own decisions about all the var-
ious aspects of their lives.
It is mind-boggling that more and
more Democrats are embracing social-
ism and the less free and less pros-
perous future it would bring. Let’s
hope their socialist fantasies stay just
that—fantasies—because our economy
might never recover from the reality of
Democrats’ proposals.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader.
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President,
when I hear my friend from South Da-
kota describe the state of the economy,
it is amazing how political amnesia
can take over on the floor of the Sen-
ate Chamber.
Do you remember the election of 2008
when Barack Obama was elected Presi-
dent of the United States? Was there
anything going on with the economy
when he took office? Oh, something
that the Senator failed to mention—
our country was facing the one of the
worst recessions in the history of the
United States.
You had to go back to the Great De-
pression to see the impact of this reces-
sion on the American economy, and it
happened under a Republican Presi-
dent—George W. Bush. President
Obama inherited that, and most people
will never forget it because in 2008 and
2009, many people saw their savings
devastated by the drop in value in the
stock market. They saw this economy
teetering on the edge and financial in-
stitutions failing. This all happened on
President George W. Bush’s watch.
President Obama inherited it and had
to turn it around—without the co-
operation of the Republican Party, I
might add. A handful of them stepped
up to join him in a bipartisan effort,
but most of them opposed him. He did
everything he needed to do to save this
economy and then started turning it
around with job creation—unprece-
dented job creation—throughout the 8
years of his term.
Now, of course, along comes a new
President who wants to take credit for
all of it and, as the Senator from South
Dakota suggested, blame President
Obama for the state of the economy he
inherited. History tells us a different
story.
After this tax cut that the Senate
Republicans are so proud of, I think
you ought to ask the American fami-
lies paying their taxes now to take a
look at their taxes and tell you how
the Trump tax cut helped them as
working families. For some, there is
some value to it, but for most, there is
none. You see, over a long period of
time, the vast majority of the benefits
of this Republican tax cut go to people
in the highest income categories. If
there were ever a group who didn’t
need a break, it is people who are al-
ready making millions of dollars each
year. Yet this Republican tax cut gave
them the break. It added trillions of
dollars to our deficit, it helped the
richest people in America, and it forgot
working families and left them behind.
Yet Republican Senators still come to
the floor and boast about it with regu-
larity.
There is a better way to approach
this. Yes, I want to give tax incentives
and tax relief to working families be-
cause we know they are not getting the
paychecks they need to meet their ob-
ligations, to save for the future, and to
make sure their kids have a better life.
We should be focused on them, not the
wealthiest among us—they are doing
quite well, thank you. Let’s focus on
working families instead. The Trump
tax cut forgot that.

Chair.)
DIABETES
Mr. President, millions of Americans
got up this morning and faced the chal-
lenge of diabetes. For most of them, it
is now routine to measure their blood
sugar and to inject insulin when nec-
essary so that they avoid the terrible
outcomes of untreated diabetes.
At the highest levels of government,
the person I think about immediately
is Sonia Sotomayor, who is an Asso-
ciate Justice of the U.S. Supreme
Court. Hers is an amazing life story.
This woman from a Puerto Rican fam-
ily went to law school, became recog-
nized as a talented and brilliant law-
yer, and eventually ascended to serve
on the U.S. Supreme Court.
I got to meet her during the period of
time when she was going through her
nomination process. She slipped and
fell at an airport in New York and
broke her ankle and couldn’t get
around as much as she wanted to, so
she parked herself in my office upstairs
and invited Senators to come in to
meet her. Between those meetings, I
stepped in the room and got to know
her and learned a lot about her.
It turns out, to no surprise, that this
wonderful Supreme Court Justice from
the Bronx is a passionate fan of the
New York Yankees baseball team. We
talked about baseball, and I said to
her: Occasionally, the Yankees play
the Cubs at Wrigley Field. Would you
join me there?
She said: Sure. Invite me.
Well, I wasn’t sure she would actu-
ally show up if I did, but I invited her.
A few years ago, Justice Sotomayor
came to Wrigley Field. She was a great
sport. They had a Cubs jersey for her to
wear, which I am sure she didn’t ex-
actly feel comfortable in, and she went

out and threw the first pitch. We had a
wonderful time.
The reason I tell that story is, during
the course of that baseball game, as we
sat together at Wrigley Field, I noticed
that several times she tested herself
and her blood sugar because of the dia-
betes she battles with every day. That
is not an uncommon experience with
diabetics.
What is uncommon is what has hap-
pened to the price of insulin facing peo-
ple with diabetes in America. You have
to go back almost 100 years to the dis-
covery of insulin. This is not a drug
that just appeared on the market.
Almost 100 years ago, researchers in
Canada ended up discovering insulin
extracted from animals, and they
ended up making it available to Ameri-
cans and everyone, for that matter, be-
cause they surrendered their patent
rights. Those who discovered insulin
said: We don’t want to make money off
of this. This is a lifesaving drug.
Over the years, insulin has evolved
from human-based insulin to what is
known as analogue insulin and syn-
thetic insulin in different dosage, but
the fundamental chemical that is sav-
ing the lives of those who suffer from
diabetes has been known for almost a
century.
What has happened to the cost of the
insulin that has been around for many
decades? It has risen dramatically.
Last week, I took to the floor for the
first pharma fleecing award, which
went to the three companies that make
insulin and sell it in America today.
Those companies are Sanofi, Novo
Nordisk, and Eli Lilly.
I took them to task for this increas-
ing cost of insulin, a drug that has
been around for so long. They are just
raising the cost way beyond the reach
of many people who have to pay for
this lifesaving drug. I told the story of
a young man covered by his parent’s
insurance—thanks to ObamaCare, the
Affordable Care Act—who, when he
reached age 26, was on his own, man-
aged a restaurant, couldn’t afford the
insulin dosage that was required, ra-
tioned his own insulin, and died as a re-
sult of that decision.
I made the point on the floor of the
Senate that these pharmaceutical com-
panies are not sensitive to the reality
of life and death in what they are
charging Americans for the cost of in-
sulin.
Yesterday, there was a news flash.
Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical company,
one of the producers of insulin prod-
ucts, announced that they were going
to reduce the cost of a generic form of
insulin known as Humalog to $140 a
dosage. That is bringing it down from
as much as $329 to $140—dramatic.
Let’s put this in perspective for one
moment. We checked the records, and
it turns out you can buy that exact
product made by that same company
for sale in Canada for as little as $38.
They are expecting—I think Eli Lilly is
expecting all of us to send flowers to
their corporate headquarters in Indian-
apolis—to send flowers because they re-
duced the cost of their drug from $329
to $140 a dosage. I am not going to send
them any flowers, and I am not going
to express any great gratitude. They
are charging Americans, under this
new bargain approach, almost four
times what Canadians are paying for
exactly the same product—four times.
To the other drug companies in-
volved in this that are producing insu-
lin: America is watching. If you are
going to continue to kite the cost of
this lifesaving drug, pressure is going
to grow politically even to the point
where the U.S. Senate may take ac-
tion. I think that day is coming.
So, for Eli Lilly: Nice first step.
When you bring the cost of insulin in
the United States for the same prod-
ucts that you are selling in Canada to
the same level, then I will send you
some flowers.
NOMINATION OF ALLISON JONES RUSHING
Mr. President, we have three judges
before us on the floor of the Senate
this week. It turns out that the filling
of judicial vacancies is the highest sin-
gle priority of the Republican leader-
ship in the Senate.
Senator MITCH MCCONNELL, the Re-
publican leader, has gone to extraor-
dinary, precedent-breaking lengths to
fill vacancies. Of course, the most no-
torious example was when Senator
MCCONNELL, then in charge of the Re-
publican majority, announced that de-
spite the death of Justice Scalia and a
vacancy on the highest court of the
land, he would refuse to fill that va-
cancy for almost 1 year because Presi-
dent Obama was in office.
The man President Obama wanted to
put in that position, Merrick Garland
from the D.C. Circuit Court, was widely
respected by Democrats and Repub-
licans alike, but his qualifications
meant nothing to Senator MCCONNELL.
The end game, in his mind, was the
chance that a Republican President
might be elected and fill that vacancy
with a Republican nominee.
Well, Senator MCCONNELL’s dream
came true when Donald Trump was
elected President, and he turned
around and nominated Justice
Gorsuch, who now serves on the Su-
preme Court, filling the Scalia va-
cancy. That was the most extreme ex-
ample that we have, in the history of
the U.S. Senate, of the defiance of tra-
dition and precedent, a defiance by
Senator MCCONNELL with one goal in
mind: to make sure that the judicial
branch of our government became a po-
litical branch of our government, to
make sure that as many Republican
conservatives, some with the most ex-
treme views, were appointed to the
bench. That has been his goal, and he
pursues that goal to this day.
There are three nominations before
us that amply demonstrate his efforts.
When Donald Trump became President,
Senate Republicans stopped their ob-
struction of judicial nominations and
started moving nominations through
at a breakneck speed.
During the last 2 years, Republicans
in the Senate bragged about filling the
courts with Trump nominees at record
pace. The Republican philosophy, when
it comes to Trump judges, seems to be,
in Senator MCCONNELL’s words, ‘‘plow
right through’’ no matter how ques-
tionable the nominee’s credentials or
judgment.
There are three more confirmation
votes scheduled this week. Let me tell
you about these nominees whom they
want to put on the court.
Allison Jones Rushing is President
Trump’s nominee to fill a North Caro-
lina seat on the Fourth Circuit Court
of Appeals. For those who are students
of the Constitution, you know that the
circuit court of appeals is the highest
court below the Supreme Court.
Allison Jones Rushing checks a lot of
the standard Trump nominee boxes.
She is a member of the Federalist Soci-
ety, an absolute requirement if Trump
is going to nominate you for a lifetime
appointment to the Federal bench,
and—this is a recurring theme as
well—she clerked for Supreme Court
Justice Clarence Thomas.
She is 36 years old. She has practiced
law for 9 years. How many cases has
she tried to verdict or judgment? Four.
Has she been the lead attorney on any
of those cases? No. She is not a mem-
ber of the bar association of the State
of North Carolina, the State in which
she would sit if she is confirmed. That
is the most scant, weakest legal re-
sume imaginable for someone who is
seeking a lifetime appointment to the
second highest court of the land.
At our hearing—which, by the way,
was held during a Senate recess over
the objection of committee Democrats;
we weren’t even in town when her hear-
ing was scheduled—Senator KENNEDY
of Louisiana, who is becoming famous
for this, started questioning her about
her breadth of legal experience.
Senator KENNEDY is a real lawyer. On
the Republican side, he has put some of
Trump’s nominees on the spot by ask-
ing them some pretty tough questions
about legal procedure in a courtroom.
Senator KENNEDY said: ‘‘I think, to
be a really good federal judge, you’ve
got to have some life experience.’’ Ms.
Rushing struggled to describe how her
life experience actually prepared her
for this lifetime appointment to the
second highest Federal court.
Senator KENNEDY made a valid point.
The fact that a judicial nominee meets
all of the litmus tests of being a loyal
Republican doesn’t mean the nominee
has the experience or the legal ability
to be a good Federal judge. It is incon-
ceivable to me that in the State of
North Carolina, they couldn’t find a
qualified and experienced conservative
Republican judge.
The Federal circuit courts are criti-
cally important. Since the vast major-
ity of cases don’t reach the Supreme
Court, the circuit courts are often the
last word. This is a position where ex-
perience matters, and, unfortunately,
Ms. Rushing doesn’t have enough of it.
I am going to oppose her.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1641
March 5, 2019
NOMINATION OF CHAD A. READLER
Mr. President, the second nominee is
Chad Readler, a 46-year-old attorney in
the Trump Justice Department. When
he was nominated to another circuit
court of appeals, the Sixth Circuit, it
was a clear sign of the Trump adminis-
tration’s strong negative feelings about
the Affordable Care Act and the fact
that that act covers preexisting condi-
tions.
Mr. Readler filed the Trump adminis-
tration’s brief in the Texas v. United
States case, in which he opposed the
Affordable Care Act’s preexisting cov-
erage requirement. Do you remember
that issue from the last election? It
was a big one. It might have been the
biggest one.
We basically said that we think
health insurance should be available to
you even if you don’t have a perfect
medical record. And who does? Hardly
any of us. Certainly, each of us knows
someone in their family who struggles
with a medical challenge, and without
a perfect medical record, you can be
denied insurance or charged premiums
you can’t pay, unless you have the pro-
tection of the law. The law is known as
the Affordable Care Act, or
ObamaCare.
Mr. Readler argued that this require-
ment of covering people with pre-
existing conditions, which benefits tens
of millions of Americans, had to be
stricken from the law. The brief Mr.
Readler signed was deeply controver-
sial. Our colleague Senator LAMAR
ALEXANDER, Republican from Ten-
nessee, called the argument that Mr.
Readler made in his brief opposing
ObamaCare ‘‘as far-fetched as any I
ever heard.’’ Thank you, LAMAR.
Two Department of Justice attorneys
withdrew from the case when they were
asked to sign the crazy arguments in
this brief, and a senior Department of
Justice litigator resigned in protest of
the bizarre arguments that Mr. Readler
signed up for.
However, almost immediately, after
Mr. Readler signed this crazy brief, he
was nominated by the White House for
a lifetime appointment to a Federal ju-
diciary.
What message is the Trump adminis-
tration sending with this nomination?
They are doubling down on their at-
tack on coverage of people with pre-
existing conditions. They are putting
in a lifetime appointment a circuit
court judge who will be watching for
vindication. They are rewarding those
who have led the fight against the pre-
existing coverage requirement. This is
deeply troubling.
That is not my only concern with Mr.
Readler. He has also defended the
Trump administration’s unconscion-
able family separation policy. Do you
remember that one? Remember when,
in March of last year, Attorney Gen-
eral Sessions came forward and proudly
announced the family separation pol-
icy? Do you remember then that 2,800
infants, toddlers, and children were
forcibly, physically removed from their
parents and placed in detention and
that these infants, toddlers, and chil-
dren were then lost in the system?
They didn’t keep a computer check on
where they were sent or who their par-
ents were.
It took a Federal judge in San Diego,
CA, to mandate and require this ad-
ministration to account for these chil-
dren. It is one of the most shameful
chapters in recent American history,
and, of course, Mr. Readler, this nomi-
nee, defended it.
He argued in favor of the Trump ad-
ministration’s efforts to end the DACA
Program—790,000 young people brought
here as children to this country, who
went through all of the hoops and paid
the fees and qualified to have a chance
to stay in America without fear of de-
portation. Well, it turns out Mr.
Readler thinks that is a bad idea.
He litigated against the rights of
same-sex couples and opposed anti-dis-
crimination protections for LGBTQ
Americans. He advocated for making
the death penalty more widely avail-
able and applying it to children. He ar-
gued for denying Byrne JAG violence
prevention funds to a city I represent:
Chicago.
It is hard to imagine a more con-
troversial partisan nominee than Mr.
Readler. Yet his nomination is going to
be rammed through this week.
NOMINATION OF ERIC E. MURPHY
Mr. President, Senate Republicans
have also scheduled to vote this week
on Eric Murphy, a 39-year-old nominee
to another Ohio-based seat on the
Sixth Circuit. Mr. Murphy is well
known for his advocacy against LGBTQ
rights, including the landmark
Obergefell case, in which he argued
against the right of same-sex couples
to marry.
He has a lengthy record of defending
restrictive voting laws. He has fought
for laws to make it more difficult for
Ohioans to exercise their fundamental
right to vote, including voter purge
laws and laws limiting the ability of
poll workers to assist voters.
I know a little bit about Ohio’s expe-
rience because, a few years ago, I
chaired a subcommittee that held a
hearing in Cleveland, OH, discussing
their decision as a State to start lim-
iting the opportunity of people to vote
in Ohio. I called those witnesses before
my subcommittee—election officials
from both political parties, Democrats
and Republicans—put them under oath
and asked them a basic question: What
was the incidence of voter fraud in
Ohio that led you to restrict the access
of people to vote, to require voter IDs,
to limit early voting? What were the
instances which led to that conclusion?
They could tell me none, not one. I
asked them: How many people have
been prosecuted for voter fraud in Ohio
that led to this? Well, maybe one sev-
eral years ago—here or there—despite
millions of votes being cast. Let’s call
this for what it is: voter suppression
authored by Republicans at every level
of government, even here in Congress,
designed to fight demography.
Republicans understand they are not
doing well with growing segments of
the U.S. population, so they are trying
to restrict and limit the rights of some
groups who may vote against them to
actually show up and vote. They go to
ridiculous lengths. It turns out that
Mr. Eric Murphy—a nominee we will
have before us this week for a circuit
court position—agrees with their posi-
tion on voter suppression.
My Republican colleagues are largely
silent about the outrageous incident
that occurred in North Carolina last
week. There was a glaring case of elec-
tion fraud, and it involved their party,
not the Democrats. It involved a gen-
tleman whose conduct was so out-
rageous and criminal, they voided the
congressional election. I can’t remem-
ber that ever occurring. Why would the
Republican Party ignore that occur-
rence in their own ranks and then try
to restrict voting for people who,
frankly, have a right, as all of us do, to
legally vote in this country? Why are
they appointing judges who would de-
fend that approach? I think it is be-
cause of the endgame. The endgame is
to restrict the number of people who
are going to vote in the future and try
to limit those who might vote against
the Republican Party.
I also am troubled that Mr. Murphy,
the nominee before us, has declined to
commit to recuse himself from matters
involving tobacco. As the Campaign for
Tobacco-Free Kids noted, Mr. Murphy
personally and extensively represented
the tobacco company R.J. Reynolds
when he was in private practice. For
example, Mr. Murphy was the attorney
to R.J. Reynolds on a series of peti-
tions to the Supreme Court that sought
to limit that tobacco company’s liabil-
ity from a landmark lawsuit in Flor-
ida. Mr. Murphy’s refusal to commit to
recuse himself from matters where he
clearly has expressed his opinions and
has gotten paid for it raises serious
questions about whether he can serve
the cause of justice.
The nominations of Eric Murphy and
Chad Readler are being pushed through
this week over the opposition of Ohio
Senator SHERROD BROWN. Senator
BROWN testified before the Senate Judi-
ciary Committee about his opposition
to Murphy and Readler. He said: ‘‘I
cannot support nominees who have ac-
tively work to strip Ohioans of their
. . . rights.’’ I hope my colleagues will
listen to Senator BROWN. No one has
fought harder for the rights and oppor-
tunities of Ohioans than that Senator.
It is shameful that circuit court
nominees like Murphy and Readler are
being moved forward over the legiti-
mate objections of their home State
Senators. Each of us as Senators knows
our State. We know when our State’s
legal community lacks confidence in a
nominee’s qualifications.
The blue-slip procedure is the mecha-
nism Senators use for each State to
speak as to these nominees. This last
week, when it came to a circuit court
position in the Ninth Circuit, two Sen-
ators from the State of Washington

S1642 March 5, 2019
were denied their blue-slip rights,
which have traditionally been given to
them in the Senate. That broke the
precedent last week and continues this
week. The Republican Senate leader-
ship will break every rule, every prece-
dent—whatever is necessary—to fill
these vacancies. Without blue slips, the
White House can ignore home State in-
terests and pick extreme judges like
the ones before us this week.
It pains me to watch my Republican
colleagues systematically dismantling
guardrail after guardrail in the judicial
nomination process, all for the sake of
stuffing the court with their
ideologues. The nomination process in
the Senate is breaking down before our
eyes. Our ability to fulfill our constitu-
tional responsibility to advise and con-
sent is diminished under the Constitu-
tion we have all sworn to uphold and
defend. That is a shameful chapter in
the history of the Senate.
Mr. President, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma.
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, the
number 22 trillion should matter to us.
That is our current debt in the United
States. Not to be confused, we have
debts, and we have deficits. You will
hear those names get thrown around
together. Deficit is the amount of over-
spending in a single year—1 year of
overspending—and debt is the collec-
tion of all of those deficits.
As a nation, our current debt is $22
trillion. To give some perspective on 22
trillion, if you were to take the total
distance of 22 trillion miles, you would
have to fly from Earth to Pluto and
back 3,081 times to get to 22 trillion
miles. This is heavy debt.
We are used to hearing about debts
and deficits in relationship to things
like home mortgages. Many of us think
about taking 30 years to pay off our
mortgage. Well, for us to pay off our
national mortgage, this $22 trillion—if
we were to balance our budget, which
is way out of balance right now, and
then have a $100 billion surplus—so
let’s say that by next year, we have a
balanced budget and a $100 billion sur-
plus. That would be a very large sur-
plus for us. How many years of $100 bil-
lion surpluses in total revenue would it
take to pay off $22 trillion? The quick
math on that is 220 years. That is ap-
proximately as long as we have been a
republic. If we had a $100 billion sur-
plus every single year for the next 220
years, we could pay off our mortgage.
Does anyone think that every single
year over the next 220 years, we are
going to both balance our budget and
have a $100 billion surplus?
The issue we face as a nation is that
we have fumbled a lot in our past. We
fumbled our spending. We fumbled our
handling of Federal tax dollars. We
have to work our way out of this.
Climbing out of this is not going to be
a 1-year deal. This is not a short-term
fix; this is an intentionally long-term
fix.
There are two things we have to
have. We have to have economic
growth. If our economy is stagnant, we
never catch up. The reason for that is,
when the economy is stagnant, more
people in our Nation need assistance.
They need housing support. They need
food support. They need other things to
help them in those scarce times. Unem-
ployment benefits go up significantly
during the time period that our econ-
omy is down because people can’t find
jobs and our safety net kicks in larger
amounts.
When we have economic growth,
fewer people need housing assistance,
fewer people need food assistance, and
fewer people receive unemployment
benefits. The economy itself grows. As
more people have jobs and make
money, more people pay taxes. So eco-
nomic growth is essential to the
growth of our economy and to working
our way out of debt. That is why the
tax reform bill was so incredibly im-
portant to us—to get a growing econ-
omy again. Our economy had been
stagnant for a decade. We would lit-
erally have never gotten out of it if we
had stayed in a stagnant economy.
Folks called me and said: When the
tax revenue changed, when the tax re-
form bill happened, it also blew a hole
in the budget. I have had folks throw
all kinds of numbers around and say
this is the giant hole that is in the
budget.
Interestingly enough, we are now a
fiscal year through. Our revenue for
fiscal year 2017—the year before the tax
reform—was $3.315 trillion. Our revenue
after the tax cut and the tax reform,
for fiscal year 2018, is $3.329 trillion. If
you are doing the math in your head,
that is $14 billion more in revenue after
the tax cuts. That means our revenue
went up the next year.
Contrary to all the myths that were
out there early on saying we were
going to have this giant hole in the
budget, our revenue went up after the
tax cuts went into place. Why? More
people had more money to invest. More
people invested. As they invested, as
they engaged in the economy, as they
had more money in their pockets, they
bought more products, and that stimu-
lated more profits. That meant people
got paid more. In this past year of our
economy, wages have gone up—espe-
cially wages for the lowest income
Americans. Their wages have gone up.
Unemployment has come down. More
people have a job. There are more op-
portunities to get a different job.
All those things are great benefits,
but that doesn’t solve $22 trillion in
debt. We need to have economic
growth, but economic growth by itself
is never going to solve the issue. We
also have to deal with our spending and
our plans.
Each year for the last 4 years, my of-
fice has released something we call
‘‘Federal Fumbles.’’ It is ways we be-
lieve the Federal Government has
dropped the ball. Each year, we take on
different areas. Over the last 4 years,
we identified over $800 billion in ways
that we could save Federal tax dollars.
For the specific problems we laid out,
there is a solution. If we want to try to
start attacking some of these things,
here is a proposal. Our goal from our
office is very simple: We believe all 100
offices should be looking for ways to
save Federal tax dollars. We believe ev-
eryone should look for ways to be more
efficient. What we are doing is not
unique to our team; every team can do
it. In fact, we believe that everyone
wants to see the debt and deficit go
down, but now there is the next step of
actually identifying how to do it.
In the last 4 years, we have identified
$800 billion in ways to save Federal tax
dollars. That is a start. That is a begin-
ning point of how to actually get us
there. That would get us back to bal-
ancing our budget, but we still have a
ways to go to get to a surplus and pay-
ing off our debt and deficit.
We just released our ‘‘Federal Fum-
bles’’ report. It is actually out today
online. People from any office or any-
place can go to lankford.senate.gov and
download the free report. This report is
a little bit different for us. We want to
identify the major problems we have
not only in overspending and blowing
our deficit, but we want to identify
ways that we are actually being ineffi-
cient in how we operate. We begin by
talking about government shutdowns,
as I think we should begin with. We
just experienced the longest govern-
ment shutdown in American history. It
is not the first by far. People have
short memories when they forget the
government shutdowns that happened
during the Carter administration, the
three times Tip O’Neill shut down the
government on President Reagan in
the 1980s, or the multiple shutdowns
that occurred on almost every Presi-
dency in the modern day. But that is
not solving the problems we have.
Last year, eight Republicans and
eight Democrats met almost the entire
year and talked about how to reform
the budget process. I am a firm believer
that we will never solve the problem
with our budgeting until we solve the
problem with how we do budgeting. We
don’t budget in a way that actually de-
termines more efficient spending. We
determine how to spend more but not
how to spend less. That is an issue we
have to solve.
The 1974 Budget Act has only worked
four times since it was written in 1974.
It is not gospel. It is not the Constitu-
tion. It needs to be redone. There are
proposals we put into place specifically
on how we can fix the budgeting proc-
ess. Again, until we get a better budget
process, we will never get a better
budget product. We identified some
simple things—how we can do a 2-year
budgeting system; how we can avoid
government shutdowns. There are sim-
ple solutions we put into place that I
think would actually be effective.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1643
March 5, 2019
We released a bipartisan bill in the
last couple of days on ending govern-
ment shutdowns that I hope we can ac-
tually get momentum toward and solve
the issue of government shutdowns.
We deal with the issue of the Presi-
dent’s budget—not just this President’s
but every President’s budgets. It has
been a problem. There has never been a
time since the 1974 Budget Act that the
President’s budget has ever been imple-
mented. It is an informational docu-
ment. Let’s turn it into what it should
be.
Let’s figure out how we can start re-
ducing our deficit. We have 12 bills we
put out every single year for spending.
There is no mandatory bill for savings.
As simple as this sounds, why don’t we
add a 13th bill to our appropriations
process? There would be 12 bills that
are designed for spending and 1 that is
designed for savings. For every single
Congress, there would have to be a sav-
ings bill. Now, that Congress can
choose how much it wants to save, but
every single Congress would have a
mandatory savings bill to figure out
what it is going to do to actually pull
our deficits back. With our being $22
trillion in debt, I don’t anticipate any-
time soon that we are not going to
need that 13th bill.
We could do this. We could fix the
way we actually make the law regard-
ing the budget, which currently is not
law but is a suggestion made by Con-
gress that has been blown past every
single year. There are all kinds of
budget games that are out there that
make the budget actually look better
than it is. Some of them are great, cute
names, like CHIMPS, or Changes in
Mandatory Program Spending. They
sound adorable, but what they actually
do is to make the budget look like it is
closer to balancing when it is actually
even further from balancing but has a
budget gimmick. We need to end some
of those.
We lay out proposals on how to re-
solve the debt ceiling. Process reforms
will make a big difference in our being
able to get on top of the big issue. They
may not be exciting and they may not
be headline-grabbing, but until we fix
these things as a body, they are never
going to get better.
We deal with Senate rules on how we
are actually going to work together to
solve these issues. The Senate has
stopped working together on a lot of
these things. So we lay out some of the
internal aspects as to how to solve
them. We lay out some bills that are
out there that we have proposed. One is
called the Taxpayers Right-To-Know
Act.
We don’t have great transparency in
our spending. If taxpayers wanted to
find out how many government pro-
grams there were that were similar in
function, they couldn’t find out. The
hard part is, as Congress, we can’t find
out either. The only way that we can
get a programmatic list or get the de-
tails of different programs from dif-
ferent Agencies is to make the request
through an entity called the GAO. Usu-
ally, between 12 and 18 months later, it
will give us back a report just to say
what programs are out there and what
those programs do.
I have met multiple times with the
director of the GAO regarding a bill
proposal called the Taxpayers Right-
To-Know Act, a bill that passed unani-
mously in the House of Representatives
during the last session. Then it came
to the Senate and stalled. This bill
does something very simple. It tells
lawmakers and taxpayers what their
government actually does. It is not
trying to hide anything. It is trying to
list every program that we have and
how much we spend on that program. If
it is evaluated, how is it evaluated?
How many employees are dedicated to
it? There is no gimmick to it. It is just
that simple. It is transparency. The
great gift to our democracy is trans-
parency in how we spend dollars.
Just this basic bill would allow every
single person in the country to ask
questions of its government. Why do
we have four programs that seem to do
the same thing? Why do we have 18 pro-
grams in another area and 16 different
entities that seem to do something
similar? Why can’t we combine that?
Why can’t we crowd-source ideas? The
reason is that we don’t put transparent
information out. We could crowd-
source the ideas of how to fix our gov-
ernment if only we allowed the tax-
payers to see their government. The
Taxpayers Right-To-Know Act allows
us to do that.
We deal with our grant reforms. It is
one of the areas in which we have
pushed pretty hard in the last several
‘‘Federal Fumbles’’ books, but we lay
out a set of ideas. There is a bill called
the GREAT Act, which passed in the
last House of Representatives over-
whelmingly. By the way, the House of
Representatives in this session, led by
the Democrats, has also passed the
GREAT Act and has sent it over to us
in order to reform the grant process
and how that information gets out.
Now, it is a first step in getting infor-
mation. I think there are more, but it
is a great first step for that.
Grants always seem to be our issue.
Some $600 billion a year is spent by the
Federal Government just on grants.
There is a great need for greater trans-
parency in that. Some grants are very
large, and some of them are small. We
can’t figure out why we do some of
them at all as Federal taxpayers. For
instance, last year, the National En-
dowment for the Humanities gave a
grant to a California professor to use
Federal tax dollars to study Soviet
winemaking—not current Russian
winemaking with Federal grant dollars
but historic Soviet winemaking.
Now, I can kind of understand why
California winemakers may want to do
a study of Soviet winemaking for some
reason, but why are Federal taxpayers
being asked to pay for a study on So-
viet winemaking? Yet we did.
Since 2001, we have given a Federal
grant for a mariachi program in Cali-
fornia. Now, I kind of understand how a
successful mariachi program that
works with children and youths may be
something we would do for a couple of
years to get it started as a community
program. That makes total sense. Yet
we have done it every year since 2001.
At some point, shouldn’t the local enti-
ties pick that up? Why is that a Fed-
eral program that has to be done year
after year after year?
The grant issues don’t have a lot of
transparency, and there is a reason for
that. It is that people don’t want to be
seen. They don’t want anyone to know
that the program is out there. We want
just to ask a simple question. Let’s do
the grants, but let’s make sure they
line up with Federal priorities. Let’s
make sure they actually line up with
strategic things that actually help our
economy and help expand our Nation
and protect our national security.
There are basic things that we can
do, and we lay some of those things
out. We lay out some questions that we
think are practical questions on renew-
able fuel and, in particular, on ethanol.
The ethanol program was designed to
reduce emissions, but when it was de-
signed to reduce emissions, it also
grandfathered in all of the entities at
that time that had produced ethanol,
and none of those were required to re-
duce emissions—only new ones.
What has happened? Practically no
new ones have come on board because
it is a lot more expensive to limit
emissions than it is to be an old facil-
ity that doesn’t limit emissions. You
can’t be competitive in limiting emis-
sions. So really what the ethanol man-
date does is to protect the old ethanol
companies to make sure they never get
competition. As a Congress, why aren’t
we looking at that?
If you are not in the Midwest, you
pay more at the gas pump every time
you fill up because of the ethanol. If
you are in the Midwest, it may be a lit-
tle cheaper for you, but if you are on
the east or the west coast, your gas
prices are higher because of the eth-
anol mandate. Are you happy with
that? As a government, we need to look
at that. We think it is a legitimate
question to ask about not only our debt
and deficit but just about basic con-
sumer spending for our GDP and the
growth of our economy.
We deal with a lot of issues with re-
gard to the Federal workforce. We deal
with regulatory reform. We walk
through some of the hardest issues
about how we are taking care of our
veterans and what is happening with
regard to taking care of things like
healthcare and transitioning them into
vocational work. We feel it is impor-
tant.
We have dug into small programs—
for instance, an IT development pro-
gram for veterans in Muskogee, OK—
because if you are in the veterans serv-
ice center in Muskogee, which is one of
the largest veteran service centers in
the country, you handle a lot of dif-
ferent documents. As you go through

that process for those great employees
who are there—and there are really
some solid people who are there—they
have to log in multiple times and use a
whole list of workarounds in their sys-
tem, which gets bogged down. Each em-
ployee there spends 45 minutes a day
just going through the logistics of log-
ging in and changing around the sys-
tem to make it work. There are 45 min-
utes a day of lost productivity for
every single person there.
The good news is that Congress allo-
cated $30 million to fix the IT problems
there. The bad news is that the prob-
lems are still there. So we are asking
the simple question: Where did that
money go? How come the problem
wasn’t fixed?
We can go on and on with regard to
these issues. In page after page, we
have tried to lay out sets of solutions—
things that we see as problems and in-
efficiencies in the way our government
is working and in the way our Congress
is working—and establish what can be
done. Our goal is simple. Laying out
‘‘Federal Fumbles’’ is a to-do list for
us. This is what we are working on
right now along with a lot of other
issues.
We encourage every office to glance
through it. Ask your staff members to
glance through and see the things that
they are working on in their offices,
and see if we are not laying out some
ideas. Let’s find ways to work to-
gether. Of all of the things to agree on,
we should be able to agree that our $22
trillion of debt needs to be addressed.
Let’s strategize as to how we are going
to solve it. Let’s find ways that our
government is inefficient and find ways
to fix it.
Let me give you one more number.
We met in a bipartisan group last
year—eight Republicans and eight
Democrats—and tried to solve this
issue on budgeting. Unfortunately, it
was unsuccessful. Those with the Con-
gressional Budget Office visited with
us, and we asked them a very specific
question as to our current level of debt.
If we were to just try to stay at our
current level of debt—not grow any
more, not get any worse—how much
would we have to tax or cut? Their re-
sponse was $400 billion a year, every
year, for the next 30 years. To just not
make the problem worse, we have to ei-
ther tax more or cut $400 billion a year,
every year, for the next 30 years to
keep it from getting worse. That is be-
cause, as the CBO stated, Federal out-
lays, which is how we are spending, are
projected to climb from 20.8 percent of
the GDP in 2019 to 23 percent by 2029.
The aging of the population and the
rising healthcare costs contribute sig-
nificantly to the growth of spending for
the major benefit programs, such as
Social Security and Medicare, and the
rising debt and higher interest rates
drive up the Federal Government’s net
interest cost.
We have reached a tipping point in
interest. Last year, our interest pay-
ments were $325 billion just in the in-
terest on our debt. The CBO estimates
that within 10 years our interest pay-
ments alone will be $928 billion. We
have crossed over that tipping point we
talked about before. Now, just to stay
at the status quo, because of the rising
interest rates and interest payments,
we have to find $400 billion a year,
every year, in new taxes or new cuts.
We are fumbling on the biggest issue
that Americans have handed us. It af-
fects our national security. It affects
the future of our children. It affects
how we take care of those who are in
poverty. It affects those who are in the
most vulnerable moments of life. It af-
fects those with disabilities, and it af-
fects our transportation.
We have to have a real dialogue
about this. We are doing our part. We
are trying to get the word out. Let’s
have a dialogue and together figure out
what we can do next in order to solve
this because none of us have plans for
a $400 billion cut next year. That
means that next year it will again get
worse, and it will keep getting worse
until we solve it.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut.
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate the remarks of my good friend,
the Senator from Oklahoma. I look for-
ward to working with him on ways that
we can try to come together and solve
some of these big problems.
In a minute, I am going to talk about
the Affordable Care Act, which is prob-
ably the signature accomplishment of a
Democratic Senate and Congress. It is
notable that the Affordable Care Act,
for all of its controversy, reduced the
deficit. It did not increase the deficit.
It is also notable that the signature ac-
complishment of the Republican Con-
gress and the Republican Senate was a
tax reduction bill that has dramati-
cally spiraled the deficit out of control.
There is $2 trillion of additional defi-
cits in that provision.
I share the concerns about the def-
icit, and I find it curious that this Con-
gress, under Republican control, has
chosen to dramatically increase defi-
cits, making us on pace for having the
biggest deficits in our legislative his-
tory—with enormous additional new
elements of debt as well.
NOMINATION OF CHAD A. READLER
Mr. President, I am here, though, to
talk about the Affordable Care Act.
One of the things we talk a lot about
here on the Senate floor is of our mu-
tual concern for people with pre-
existing conditions. These are the 130
million Americans who are sick or who
have histories of sickness. If you were
to listen to both sides of the aisle, you
would believe that everyone is on board
with the idea that we should provide
protections to individuals who are sick
or who have ever been sick.
Yet actions do not meet words when
it comes down to it in the U.S. Senate.
Over the last 2 years, my Republican
colleagues have spared no expense or
effort to try to strip away protections
for those individuals with preexisting
conditions that were in the Affordable
Care Act. The repeal of the Affordable
Care Act is the most obvious example
of that.
This week, we will have a rare oppor-
tunity to take an up-or-down vote on
this issue of whether we support keep-
ing protections for people with pre-
existing conditions in this country.
The reason for that is, we are going to
vote on a nominee to the Sixth Circuit
Court who orchestrated—who di-
rected—the Department of Justice’s at-
tempts to take away protections for
people with preexisting conditions
through the court process.
Chad Readler filed a brief in a case
brought by State attorneys general—
all of them Republicans—to strike
from the Affordable Care Act the pro-
tection for people with preexisting con-
ditions.
Normally, when State attorneys gen-
eral come after the constitutionality of
a statute, whether those are Repub-
lican or Democratic attorneys general,
the administration, whether it be a Re-
publican or Democratic administra-
tion, defends the constitutionality of
the statute.
This was an exceptional case in
which these Republican attorneys gen-
eral were trying to take away protec-
tions for people with preexisting condi-
tions, saying the ACA was unconstitu-
tional, and an Assistant Attorney Gen-
eral by the name of Chad Readler stood
up and volunteered to file a brief alleg-
ing that, in fact, the attorneys general
were right—a rare, almost completely
unprecedented example of the Depart-
ment of Justice arguing against the
constitutionality of a statute that had
been passed by the Congress and signed
by the President.
Interestingly, before Chad Readler
decided to file that brief, others at the
Department of Justice refused. In fact,
one lawyer left the Department of Jus-
tice because he wouldn’t put his name
on something so absurd as the brief
Chad Readler filed.
I am not the only person who thinks
the arguments in his brief trying to
strike down those protections for peo-
ple with preexisting conditions was ab-
surd. In fact, Senator ALEXANDER read
Readler’s brief and said the arguments
in it were ‘‘as far-fetched as any I have
ever heard.’’ That is a Republican Sen-
ator.
Now, the consequences of the judge
following the recommendations of
Chad Readler were catastrophic. In
fact, the judge struck down the Afford-
able Care Act. That order has been held
in abeyance temporarily, but the con-
sequences of the Readler brief would be
that 133 million Americans would lose
their protections from higher rates be-
cause they were sick or had been sick.
The 20 million people who had insur-
ance would lose it virtually overnight.
Admittedly, the Readler brief didn’t
agree with every single element of the
lawsuit of the attorneys general but
enough of it such that it was very clear

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1645
March 5, 2019
the administration was weighing in on
the side of the petitioners.
Almost immediately after filing that
brief, he was nominated to serve on the
appellate court, sending a very clear
signal to all of those in the administra-
tion that if you take a leadership role
on trying to strip away protections for
people with preexisting conditions, you
will be rewarded—in this case, re-
warded with a lifetime appointment.
So we are about to vote on the archi-
tect of this administration’s legal
strategy to try to undo the most pop-
ular, most important protections in
the Affordable Care Act, and it rep-
resents this rare opportunity to under-
stand where Senators stand.
It is super easy. It takes no political
risk to stand up and say you support
protecting people who are sick and
making sure insurance companies don’t
jack up their rates. As it turns out, it
is a little bit harder to actually back
up your words with actions, but this
one isn’t that hard. Voting against
Chad Readler isn’t that difficult, in
part, because Senator BROWN, who is
the Senator from Ohio who did not sign
a blue slip for Chad Readler’s nomina-
tion, has made it clear as early as 10
minutes ago that he is willing to sup-
port and sign a blue slip for a main-
stream conservative nominee.
In this case, Democrats aren’t saying
we want a nominee to the Sixth Circuit
who isn’t one who could be charitably
described as a conservative nominee.
We just don’t want a nominee who has
made his mark trying to tear down
protections for sick people in this
country, but that is what happens
when you get rid of the blue ship. Sen-
ator MCCONNELL and Senator GRASS-
LEY have gotten rid of this decades-old
protection to try to make sure nomi-
nees to the Federal bench, to the appel-
late bench in this case, have the sup-
port of their home State Senators.
When you do that, you tend to get a
little bit more mainstream nominees.
Now that the blue slip is gone, now
that Senator BROWN has no ability to
weigh in on individuals who are going
to be making law in his State, you get
a much more extreme nominee like
this.
So let’s see what happens. I hope
there are some Republicans who will
stand up and decide they are going to
put their votes where their mouths
have been on the question of protec-
tions for people with preexisting condi-
tions, but at the very least, the Amer-
ican public will get to see where we all
stand on this very important question
in a matter of hours.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

NUCLEAR DETERRENCE
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, in the
116th Congress, I am once again
chairing the Senate Armed Services
Committee Subcommittee on Strategic
Forces, which oversees our nuclear
forces.
Over the coming months, I will be
coming to the floor to discuss specific
components of our nuclear deterrent
and their contributions to the defense
of this Nation.
Today, I rise to speak about the crit-
ical role strategic bombers play in our
nuclear triad. The triad is known for
its flexibility and resilience, and bomb-
ers contribute to this flexibility in im-
portant ways. They are highly visible,
and they can be forward deployed.
They can be used to signal resolve to
our adversaries and commitment to
our allies.
This benefit is not theoretical. Bomb-
ers have been used in exactly this way
many times, particularly on the Ko-
rean Peninsula. Bombers are also re-
callable and, when armed with standoff
weapons, they can offer the President a
variety of tailored response options in
a crisis.
As the oldest leg of our nuclear triad,
bombers have a long and distinguished
history. In some ways, the story of the
strategic bomber begins in the great
State of Nebraska.
In the early 1940s, Bellevue, NE, was
home to the Martin Bomber Plant,
which was located on the land that is
now Offutt Air Force Base. The Martin
plant, with the help of thousands of Ne-
braska workers, built and modified the
Enola Gay and Bockscar. These two B–
29 bombers went on to deliver the Lit-
tle Boy and Fat Man nuclear bombs
over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, ending
World War II and ushering in the nu-
clear age. The horrific destruction of
these attacks established the deterrent
power that has prevented conflict on a
global scale ever since.
As ballistic missile technology
evolved, the bomber continued to be
the mainstay of our nuclear deterrent
forces through the early 1970s. Al-
though bombers carried the heavy load
for many decades, today we no longer
rely on them in the same way. Nuclear-
armed bombers have not been on 24-
hour ready alert status since the end of
the Cold War in 1991, and the respon-
siveness that alert-status bombers pro-
vided now resides primarily with our
ICBM forces.
The strength provided by the other
legs of the triad have allowed us to
take our nuclear capable bombers off
alert and use them for conventional
missions. When we send B–52 bombers
to Afghanistan to complete a conven-
tional mission, we exercise the triad’s
flexibility. When U.S. B–2 bombers
struck targets in Libya, we utilized the
triad’s flexibility. These examples
clearly demonstrate that the flexi-
bility of the triad is not an abstract
concept. It is something our forces use
every single day.
Our current nuclear bomber force
consists of 46 B–52 and 20 B–2 aircraft.
While we rely on this highly capable
but aging fleet, we also look ahead to
the future of the bomber force, and
that is the B–21.
As the B–21 development progresses,
it is important to remember the les-
sons learned from the last time we de-
veloped a nuclear bomber, the B–2. As
the Cold War ended, nuclear tensions
cooled and the need for an expensive
nuclear-capable stealth bomber seemed
to diminish. Even though the B–2 had
already been developed and significant
resources spent on research and devel-
opment, Congress decided to reduce the
final order from 132 aircraft to 20. In so
doing, the per-unit cost of the airframe
rose to $2 billion. The Air Force has
said it plans to buy at least 100 B–21s,
but many in this Chamber believe more
are likely required to meet the conven-
tional mission the Nation expects our
Air Force to perform.
The nuclear triad is the bedrock of
our national security, and the airborne
leg continues to contribute to the
strength and resilience of our nuclear
forces. It is our responsibility to ensure
that this capability is modernized, par-
ticularly as the global security envi-
ronment transitions to one of long-
term strategic competition.

Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I
want to start my remarks this after-
noon by saying congratulations to our
friend Senator RICHARD SHELBY, Ala-
bama’s longest serving U.S. Senator as
of this Sunday.
Here in Washington, we know him as
chairman of the all-powerful Senate
Appropriations Committee, which
holds the congressional purse strings,
but Alabamians, from Huntsville to
Gulf Shores, know him as a devoted
public servant working for the good of
all of his constituents and an invalu-
able Member of the U.S. Senate.
Senator SHELBY is a man of prin-
ciples. He believes in smaller govern-
ment, supports the Second Amend-
ment, and works tirelessly for the mili-
tary men and women from Alabama.

S1646 March 5, 2019
There is only one thing he is more
proud of than his home State, and that
may be the Crimson Tide football team
and the number of their national cham-
pionships.
I just wanted to start my comments
this afternoon by saying congratula-
tions to our friend Senator RICHARD
SHELBY for 32 years of serving the peo-
ple of Alabama.
NOMINATIONS
Madam President, we will continue
to push through a long list of executive
and judicial nominations pending be-
fore the Senate.
People may wonder, well, why are we
making such an emphasis on nomina-
tions? That is mainly because of all of
the foot-dragging and obstruction we
have seen from our friends on the other
side of the aisle. They have basically
burned the clock and have caused
many nominees to simply withdraw.
There are not many people who can put
their lives on hold and wait a year and
a half for the Senate to act on their
nominations, especially when it is not
a controversial nomination in and of
itself.
This is simply a continuing reaction
to President Trump’s election in 2016.
Many of our colleagues simply haven’t
gotten over the fact that he won. They
are just not willing to engage in the
normal sorts of advice and consent
that the Constitution calls for, nor will
they let the President and his adminis-
tration get the people they want on his
team, even if there is not an extraor-
dinary problem.
Under previous administrations, we
know the process to confirm nominees
is relatively quick and unremarkable
and that cloture votes were rarely re-
quired. As soon as you start talking
about cloture votes, people start fall-
ing asleep, but it is actually a pretty
significant problem.
Cloture votes basically mean we have
to burn the clock and go through the
procedures—all of the different hoops
that you have to jump through absent
some consent or an agreement.
As you can see, under President
Trump, the Senate has had to file for
cloture 128 times, so it has caused an
extended debate, even on
uncontroversial nominees. What is
worse, even after you vote to close,
which is what cloture is, then you still
have to burn 30 hours postcloture,
which makes it very difficult for us to
do anything else in the Senate other
than to confirm uncontroversial nomi-
nees.
As you can see, when President Clin-
ton was in office, in his first 2 years of
office there were only eight cloture
votes on nominees. Under President
George W. Bush, No. 43, there were only
4, and, of course, under President
Obama, there were 12. That is a far cry
from the 128 nominees who were essen-
tially obstructed by our colleagues
across the aisle.
They aren’t forcing these votes be-
cause these nominees are controversial
or because they are unqualified. Just
look at one of the nominees we just
confirmed as an example. Nearly 400
days after he was nominated, John
Ryder was finally confirmed for a
board position with the Tennessee Val-
ley Authority.
Mr. Ryder was initially nominated on
February 1 of last year—more than a
year ago. Not long after he testified be-
fore the Committee on the Environ-
ment and Public Works, we saw unani-
mous support from the members of the
committee—bipartisan support.
During simpler times, the process
would have been pretty straight-
forward. He would have been confirmed
by the full Senate without any valu-
able floor time. He probably would
have been confirmed by consent or by a
voice vote, which would not have
burned all of this valuable floor time,
which is necessitated when you have to
file for cloture. It is now clear that
these simpler, more civil, and more bi-
partisan times have gone out the win-
dow.
Our Democratic colleagues have
forced cloture on this nominee. Again,
it is not because he is not qualified and
not because he is controversial but be-
cause they are literally using every
trick in the book to bring the work of
the Senate to a crawl.
It is not Republicans who are being
hurt; it is the American people. We are
here to serve the American people and
not to engage in these sorts of political
games that result in nothing.
Sometimes we have important bat-
tles, debates, and disagreements, but
usually they are over important prin-
ciples. But here, it is just about burn-
ing time and making nominees wait,
sometimes for a year or more before
their nomination is even voted on.
I am personally aware of a number of
nominees who have said: Do you know
what? No more. I have a life to live. I
can’t put my life on hold waiting for
the Senate to vote on my nomination,
even if it is not going to be controver-
sial.
I am afraid we will see the Demo-
crats’ political theater continue. One
of the nominees we will soon be voting
on is John Fleming of Louisiana, who
has been nominated as Assistant Sec-
retary of Commerce for Economic De-
velopment.
Mr. Fleming’s nomination was first
received by the Senate in June of last
year. Again, the committee held a
hearing and favorably reported out his
nomination within 6 weeks. Here we
are, 7 months later, and he still hasn’t
been confirmed because the only way
our Democratic colleagues will allow
that is by going through this long and
laborious procedure of filing for cloture
and burning hours on the clock.
Again, under previous administra-
tions, a nominee for this sort of a posi-
tion would be confirmed with little or
no fanfare and certainly without sit-
ting on the calendar for 7 months.
Again, this isn’t about Republicans
versus Democrats. Honestly, this is
about punishing the American people
and these nominees who want to serve
by keeping them hanging and forcing
them to wait more than a year before
they are confirmed. This, again, is part
of the ‘‘Never Trump’’ syndrome, part
of the Trump derangement syndrome
that seems to be an epidemic here in-
side the beltway.
I personally see no reason these
games should continue to play out, and
that is why I am an advocate for the
proposed rule changes to expedite the
process.
These expedited changes we will
make is something that, if the shoe
were on the other foot and we had a
Democratic President, Republicans
could gladly live with. This isn’t about
gaining some advantage by a rules
change; this is simply about returning
the Senate to some sense of normalcy.
GEAR UP PROGRAM
Madam President, on another topic,
this is a remarkable time for our Na-
tion’s economy. Sometimes with all of
the noise, chatter, and just the chaos
that is part of Washington these days,
we forget the fact that our economy is
doing so well that we are seeing a
record number of people employed, and
we are seeing the highest employment
rate for African Americans and His-
panics at any time in recorded history.
I attribute some of this—not all of
it—to the tax reform bill that we
passed over a year ago. Since that
time, 3 million jobs have been added
here in America—3 million jobs.
Wages are on the rise. Labor is tight.
It is hard to find people to work, par-
ticularly in places like West Texas in
the Permian Basin around Odessa and
Midland, which has the lowest unem-
ployment rate in the country because
of the energy boom there that has been
long associated with that part of our
State and that part of our country.
Workers are seeing more of their
hard-earned money in their paycheck
because tax rates are lower. As I said,
unemployment hit its lowest rate in
nearly 50 years. That is something to
celebrate.
Today we find ourselves in the
unique position of having more job
openings than jobseekers. It is an indi-
cation of how great our economy is
doing and a reminder that we need to
continue to invest in our workforce.
One of the biggest reasons these jobs
are unfilled isn’t because there aren’t
willing candidates. Let me say that
again. The reason these jobs are un-
filled isn’t because there aren’t willing
candidates. It is because the candidates
who are available lack the right skills.
For many students, postsecondary
education seems like a pipe dream.
Many of my constituents in Texas
come from families who have never at-
tended college and, thus, are the first
generation of young students who hope
to achieve a higher education.
There is a great program that I am
supporting. I introduced bipartisan leg-
islation with our colleagues here called

Readiness for Undergraduate Program,

also known as GEAR UP. That program
is working to change the landscape and
the educational opportunity for many
young people still in middle school and
high school.
This grant program is designed to in-
crease college and career readiness
through a range of academic, social,
and planning support.
Starting in seventh grade, you have
to start making decisions about what
your middle school and high school
education will be. If you guess wrong
and don’t take the appropriate math
class, for example, then you can’t fin-
ish the curriculum you need in order to
go to the college you want to go to.
One reason GEAR UP has been so
successful is that it recognizes that
college and career readiness begins
early, not when you are graduating
from high school but when you are in
seventh grade, literally.
GEAR UP is also unique because it
doesn’t use a blanket approach to sup-
port students. What works well in one
State or in one school district may not
be the best in another, so local leaders
and parents have the flexibility to
cater to their students’ needs.
The best part of GEAR UP is that it
actually works. It is a government pro-
gram that works. GEAR UP students
graduate from high school at a higher
rate than their peers, regardless of eth-
nicity or income, and they attend col-
lege at a higher rate.
Texans have benefited from $885 mil-
lion in GEAR UP grants over the last
20 years. We have seen incredible re-
sults, but I believe there are additional
steps we can take to ensure that local
leaders and parents have the increased
flexibility they need to tailor the pro-
grams to the needs of these students.
Over the last few weeks, I have had a
chance to travel my State and talk to
students, teachers, administrators, and
community leaders in Texas about the
legislation I have mentioned, the
GEAR UP for Success Act.
In Harlingen, for example, in the Rio
Grande Valley, I held a roundtable
with superintendents and community
leaders from across that area to learn
about the impact of GEAR UP there.
They say that they have seen great re-
sults in terms of improved graduation
and participation in postsecondary
education, and they are full of ideas
about how to build on the progress
they have already seen.
I also got a chance to spend some
time with the students themselves. As
I mentioned, this program begins with
seventh graders, and I had a chance to
meet several members of the class of
2024—you heard that right, 2024—who
have just begun their journey because
they are in seventh grade. You can see
the excitement in their eyes and that
hunger for success.
Particularly in the Rio Grande Val-
ley, with a large Hispanic population,
as I have said, many students whose
parents did not go to college realize
that college and education generally is
the key to the American dream. Be-
cause of GEAR UP, these students
don’t view college now as a farfetched
fantasy. They view it as part of their
life plan, and they are excited about it.
That is no doubt, at least in part, due
to the older students I was able to
meet. We talked about where they were
hoping to go to college and what they
want to major in.
One of the neatest things about the
GEAR UP program is that the older
students will actually mentor some of
the younger students in the GEAR UP
program and talk about what a dif-
ference it made in their lives and in
their education.
All of these students have bright ca-
reers ahead of them. One of them told
me he wants to be a U.S. Senator. I
said: You realize that you have to wait
until you are 30 years old to do that.
He is willing to wait. It was a pleasure
to spend time with all of them.
Last month I was in my hometown of
San Antonio at Gus Garcia Middle
School, and I held another roundtable
with students and school administra-
tors to learn about how GEAR UP has
impacted their communities. There
was one student, in particular, whose
life story illustrates just how much
this program can help.
Francisco Hernandez told me that he
and his family were once homeless, but
with the support he received from
GEAR UP and Sam Houston High
School, he was able to turn his life
around and make his dream of going to
college a reality.
Not only is Francisco now a student
at San Antonio College with a prom-
ising career ahead of him, he is also, as
I suggested a moment ago, a mentor
for younger students. Students like
Francisco are a reminder of how impor-
tant it is to support programs like
GEAR UP.
These pieces of legislation, these pro-
grams, and these grants we vote on
here in the Senate have an impact on
the lives of real people, but they are
also reminders of how we must find
ways to do more and to better serve
these students.
This bill, as I said, the GEAR UP for
Success Act, will provide greater flexi-
bility to school districts on how they
use GEAR UP funds. In some instances,
they told me that the local match was
a prohibitive problem. So what we in-
tend to do is to cut that local match
requirement in half.
There is, as I said, no one-size-fits-all
program to prepare all students for life
after high school. Each school district
knows its students’ needs better than
Washington ever could. So they should
have the flexibility to design and im-
plement programs that will work best.
This legislation will also improve
GEAR UP research and evaluation at
both local and national levels so we
can figure out what the best practices
are and what is working and what isn’t,
and it will reduce the administrative
burdens for those who receive the grant
so they can focus less on paperwork
and more on successful student out-
comes.
The young Texans I have heard from
over the last few weeks are inspiring,
and they are excited about their fu-
ture. That is the way we want them to
be. I hope Chairman ALEXANDER and
Ranking Member MURRAY will include
the GEAR UP for Success Act in their
efforts to reauthorize the Higher Edu-
cation Act this Congress so we can con-
tinue to support students like this
across the country.

NOMINATION OF CHAD A. READLER
Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, it is
very important that the American peo-
ple know that Republicans are still
trying to take away their healthcare.
Last year, Republicans filed a lawsuit
arguing that the entire Affordable Care
Act should be invalidated, and now
they want to give a promotion to the
person who led that effort at the De-
partment of Justice. That person’s
name is Chad Readler, currently a Dep-
uty Assistant Attorney General at the
Justice Department.
Last year, he filed an argument on
behalf of the Department of Justice to
take away protections for people with
preexisting conditions. The American
Medical Association said that Mr. Re-
adler’s argument would ‘‘have a dev-
astating impact on doctors, patients,
and the American health system as a
whole,’’ that it ‘‘would cause 32 million
people to become uninsured,’’ and that
it would double insurance premiums.
The American Medical Association
was not alone here. Lawyers at the
Justice Department refused to sign
their names to Mr. Readler’s brief. One
senior career official actually resigned
in protest, and Senator LAMAR ALEX-
ANDER said that his arguments were
‘‘as farfetched as any I’ve ever heard.’’
On the same day that Mr. Readler
filed his argument to take away peo-
ple’s healthcare, the White House nom-
inated him to a lifetime appointment
to the bench on the Sixth Circuit. They
wanted to promote him because of his
good work suing in Federal court try-
ing to invalidate the entire healthcare
system—the entire healthcare law.
We should not sign off on this nomi-
nee—not if we care about protecting
the health of our constituents, espe-
cially those who have cancer, asthma,
diabetes, or any other preexisting med-
ical condition.
We should also be wary of putting
someone on the Sixth Circuit who
makes the kind of poor, farfetched ar-
gument that Mr. Readler made, be-
cause this isn’t purely a question of
public policy. If it were public policy,
you would definitely say: Don’t take 32
million people and take away their
healthcare—right? If it were public pol-
icy, you would say: Don’t do the thing
that is going to double premiums.
This is about what kind of a lawyer
he is. This is about what kind of a
judge he would be. The White House
may want to reward his efforts, but we
don’t have to.

S1648 March 5, 2019
If you look at Mr. Readler’s record
and feel that, OK, he tried to deport
the Dreamers. Even if you concede past
his defense of the Muslim ban or his
discrimination against a gay couple
who wanted to get married or even if
you don’t mind that he is trying to
make it harder for people to vote or his
argument to allow kids under 18 to be
sentenced to death—even if none of
that bothers you—it should bother you
that a Senator in Mr. Readler’s home
State has not returned a blue slip. It
should really bother you. If you say
you are for protecting people with pre-
existing conditions, here is your oppor-
tunity.
It is one thing to say: Well, we would
never do that. We would never take
away protections for people with pre-
existing conditions. After all, we all
know people with preexisting condi-
tions.
I have no doubt that is the actual
sentiment among Members of the Sen-
ate on both sides. Here is the thing.
This week is the week to walk the talk.
This week is the week to decide wheth-
er or not you are for protecting people
with preexisting conditions, because
you have a guy who led the effort to
gut protections for people with pre-
existing conditions.
Mr. Readler is unqualified for other
reasons, but now we have a litmus test
on where you stand on preexisting con-
ditions. It is not enough to say it in
your campaign debate. It is not enough
to say it in the hallway and say: Hey,
we want to protect people.
Here is your moment. Someone who
has dedicated some portion of his pro-
fessional life to gut the American
healthcare system is now being given a
permanent job on the Sixth Circuit.
Everybody should vote no.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I
don’t come to the floor that often to
ask about or to talk about any person
who is being recommended by our
President, whether I agree or disagree.
This is one time I feel very compelled
to do so.
I rise today to urge my colleagues
not to confirm Chad Readler to the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Cir-
cuit. I would say this: A vote for him,
in my estimation, is a vote against
every West Virginian and every Amer-
ican with a preexisting condition, and I
will tell you why.
After 20 State attorneys general and
Governors challenged the constitu-
tionality of the Affordable Care Act
and its protections for people with pre-
existing conditions in Texas v. United
States, as Acting Assistant Attorney
General, Readler refused to defend the
Affordable Care Act. That is his job.
That is the law of the land. He refused,
basically, to protect and defend it,
which resulted in putting nearly 800,000
West Virginians with cancer, heart dis-
ease, asthma, or diabetes and women
who care to have a baby at risk of fi-
nancial jeopardy if they get sick.
Readler was not just a participant
but the chief architect of the Depart-
ment of Justice’s decision to not de-
fend the current law in the case. Let
me make sure we all understand how
devastating this could have been but
also the intent. Coming from the As-
sistant Attorney General, he was not
just a participant, but he was the chief
architect of the Department of Jus-
tice’s decision to not defend—to not do
his job, to not defend—the current law
in the case.
He wrote and filed a brief arguing
that the Affordable Care Act’s indi-
vidual mandate is unconstitutional,
and that if the mandate is stricken as
unconstitutional, the Affordable Care
Act’s protections for the people with
preexisting conditions should also be
stricken.
He is taking the position as one per-
son, not as an elected official, saying
that it is unconstitutional when we
voted in this body not to repeal it. We
voted in this body, representing the
people of the United States, not to re-
peal it. He made a decision as one per-
son, not an elected official, saying it is
unconstitutional.
This brief was so controversial and
inhumane that several career lawyers
with the Civil Division refused to sign
their name to this brief, and one senior
career Department of Justice official
resigned because of his decision.
After the Department of Justice’s an-
nouncement, I introduced a resolution
to authorize the Senate legal counsel
to intervene in this lawsuit on behalf
of the Senate and defend all Ameri-
cans’ right to access affordable health
insurance. Because of Readler and the
Department of Justice’s decision to
abandon its responsibility, the court
ruled against Americans with pre-
existing conditions in December.
This misguided and inhumane ruling
will kick millions of Americans and
tens of thousands of West Virginians
off their health insurance. So 800,000
West Virginians with preexisting con-
ditions will be at risk of losing their
health insurance, and the thousands of
West Virginians who gained health in-
surance through the Medicaid expan-
sion will no longer qualify. This ruling
is just plain wrong, and it is rightfully
being appealed to a higher court.
While I continue to fight to pass my
resolution to defend Americans and
West Virginians with preexisting con-
ditions, I must commend our col-
leagues in the House who passed a
similar resolution earlier this year
that allowed their legal counsel to in-
tervene. I wish we had both legal coun-
sel from the House and the Senate in-
tervening together.
In this body, I am known for exam-
ining judicial nominees fairly, based on
their qualifications, temperament, and
judgment, which I take very seriously,
but I cannot stand idly by and allow
the Senate to confirm a person who
singlehandedly tried to rip insurance
away from West Virginians and Ameri-
cans when he had no authority to do
so. He was not an elected official, not
speaking on behalf of the law, not de-
fending the law but trying to represent
his own beliefs or political agenda.
This vote today will show Americans
and West Virginias with preexisting
conditions who is really fighting for
them and all of us who believe strongly
in their right to be able to care for
themselves. A vote for Mr. Readler is a
vote against people with preexisting
conditions, and I hope my colleagues
on the other side of the aisle will join
me in voting against his confirmation.
This is something I don’t do often. I
don’t take it lightly. It is very serious.
This gentleman has basically shown it
is not about the law; it is not about the
Constitution; it is about his politics
and himself and not a man who should
be sitting on a higher court.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the

I ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.

DECLARATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President,
last week, I announced my intention to
vote in favor of H.J. Res. 46. This is a
resolution expressing disapproval of
the President’s February 15 proclama-
tion of a national emergency. At that
same time, I joined with my colleague,
the Senator from New Mexico, along
with the Senator from Maine, Ms. COL-
LINS, and the Senator from New Hamp-
shire, Mrs. SHAHEEN, in the introduc-
tion of the Senate companion, S.J. Res.
10.
I want to take just a few moments
this afternoon and speak to my ration-
ale not only for my statements but for
my support for terminating the na-
tional emergency. It is, certainly, not
based on disagreement over the issue of
border security on our southern border.
I recognize full well, along with, I be-
lieve, all of our colleagues here, the
situation on the border and the human-
itarian issues that face us. The issue
that faces us with the level of those
coming across our borders is not a sus-
tainable situation, and, certainly, the
influx of drugs that we are seeing in
this community must be addressed.
Rather, my concern is, really, about
the institution of the Congress and the
constitutional balance of powers that, I
think, are just fundamental to our de-
mocracy. In my view, it really comes
down to article I of the Constitution.
Article I, section 7, clause 8 reads: ‘‘No

Money shall be drawn from the Treas-
ury, but in consequence of Appropria-
tion.’’
This provision and the necessary and
proper clause of article I, section 8,
clause 18 and the taxing and spending
clauses—article VIII, clause 1—are just
generally regarded as the basis for the
notion that the power to spend resides
in the Congress. We say it around
here—that the power of the purse rests
with the Congress.
Of all of these three clauses that I
have just articulated, the admonition
that no money shall be drawn from the
Treasury but in consequence of appro-
priation is probably the clearest ex-
pression of the Framers’ view that the
executive has no power to spend money
in a manner that is inconsistent with
the intentions of the Congress.
Justice Story, in his 1883 Com-
mentaries on the Constitution, charac-
terized that clause as an important
means of self-protection for the legisla-
tive department.
He went on to write:
The [legislature] has, and must have, a
controlling influence over the executive
power, since it holds at its command all of
the resources by which the executive could
make himself formidable. It possesses the
power of the purse of the nation and the
property of the people.
Again, he just very clearly articu-
lates where these lanes of authority—
these lanes of jurisdiction—reside.
This past weekend, on Sunday, a
local newspaper, the Fairbanks Daily
News-Miner, published an editorial. In
that editorial, it was argued that our
colleagues here in the Senate should
vote for the resolution of disapproval.
The editorial is entitled: ‘‘A dangerous
course: Congress shouldn’t cede power
to president in border funding dis-
pute.’’
Madam President, I ask unanimous
consent that the editorial be printed in
the RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
[From the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner,
March 3, 2019]
A DANGEROUS COURSE: CONGRESS SHOULDN’T
CEDE POWER TO PRESIDENT IN BORDER
FUNDING DISPUTE
(Editorial Board)
Two reasons for alarm exist regarding
President Donald Trump’s declaration of a
national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico bor-
der so that he can reallocate funds approved
by Congress for other purposes.
First is the problem of potential precedent.
Is building a wall at the border the type of
situation envisioned by Congress when it ap-
proved the National Emergencies Act in
1976? Or is the president simply declaring a
national emergency as a way to overcome a
political dispute over a funding allocation?
If it is political dispute and is upheld by
the U.S. Supreme Court, where the issue is
almost certainly headed, how will Repub-
licans in Congress who support the presi-
dent’s emergency declaration react when—
not if—a Democrat occupies the White House
and uses the same national emergency logic
to force actions on climate change that Re-
publicans find objectionable?
That is one concern.
Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski earlier
indicated she would support a disapproval
resolution and Thursday joined fellow GOP
Sen. Susan Collins, of Maine, and two Demo-
cratic senators to introduce the resolution in
the Senate. Sen. Dan Sullivan, Alaska’s
other Republican senator, has not stated
publicly how he will vote.
The Senate resolution is similar to one ap-
proved by the House on Tuesday. Rep. Don
Young voted against the resolution. The Na-
tional Emergencies Act requires that the
Senate vote on the House resolution; a vote
is expected within the next two weeks.
There is also an issue that is greater than
that of border security. It is the issue of
guarding against encroachment by one
branch of government on the power of an-
other.
Members of Congress should be asked these
questions: Do you believe the president is
properly exercising authority granted by
Congress under the National Emergencies
Act? Or do you think his emergency declara-
tion is an unacceptable overreach by the ex-
ecutive branch?
Encroachment by one branch on another
and the consolidating of power in one branch
worried some of the Founders as they crafted
our system of independent yet interlocking
government branches. The Federalist Papers,
the series of 85 writings that aimed to con-
vince the public to support ratification of
the Constitution, contain references to that
concern.
James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 48,
published Feb. 1, 1788, that ‘‘It will not be de-
nied, that power is of an encroaching nature,
and that it ought to be effectually restrained
from passing the limits assigned to it. After
discriminating, therefore, in theory, the sev-
eral classes of power, as they may in their
nature be legislative, executive, or judiciary,
the next and most difficult task is to provide
some practical security for each, against the
invasion of the others.’’
‘‘Will it be sufficient to mark, with preci-
sion, the boundaries of these departments, in
the constitution of the government, and to
trust to these parchment barriers against
the encroaching spirit of power?’’
The concern appears again in Federalist
No. 51, written by Madison and Alexander
Hamilton and published Feb. 8, 1788: ‘‘The
great security against a gradual concentra-
tion of the several powers in the same de-
partment, consists in giving to those who ad-
minister each department the necessary con-
stitutional means and personal motives to
resist encroachments of the others. . . . Am-
bition must be made to counteract ambi-
tion.’’
Congress, as a co-equal branch of govern-
ment, should stand up for itself.
President Trump has said he will veto the
resolution if it comes to his desk. And at
this stage it appears unlikely that there are
enough votes in Congress to override that
veto.
What each member of Congress says and
does in this funding dispute will reveal clear-
ly how they view the law and the relation-
ship between the legislative and executive
branches.
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President,
in support of the argument outlined in
that headline, the News-Miner’s edi-
torial board wrote the following:
Encroachment by one branch on another
and the consolidating of power in one branch
worried some of the Founders as they crafted
our system of independent yet interlocking
government branches. The Federalist Papers
. . . contain references to that concern.
The editorial board goes on to refer
to Federalist No. 51, which reads:
The great security against a gradual con-
centration of the several powers in the same
department, consists in giving to those who
administer each department the necessary
constitutional means and personal motives
to resist encroachments of others. . . . Ambi-
tion must be made to counteract ambition.
When you translate that into just
plain old English, it basically means
Congress is a coequal branch of govern-
ment, and, as such, Congress should
stand up for itself. That really is the
reason—the root—of why I have an-
nounced my support for this resolution
of disapproval. I think it is fair to say
that we all have disagreements around
here about all sorts of things that are
part of the appropriations process, and,
certainly, the issue of border funding
or just border security is no exception.
Even if the fiscal year 2019 appropria-
tions process had run smoothly, which
it certainly did not, think about how
we got to where we are right now. The
President submitted his budget last
year. He requested money for barriers
on the border and other aspects of bor-
der security. The request went through
the appropriations process. I serve on
that subcommittee. In the Senate sub-
committee, we advanced out of the
committee the President’s request.
After 3 months of continuing resolu-
tions, we ended up in a stalemate with
the other body last year, calendar year
2018. In January, control of the other
body changed. The stalemate continued
until the lengthy negotiations con-
cluded, which allowed both bodies to
pass and for the President to agree to
sign an appropriations package just
several weeks ago in February.
Again, that appropriations package
was, I think it is probably fair to say,
the result of a great deal of back-and-
forth between the House, the Senate,
and the White House, but it was clearly
something that did help to advance the
priorities that the President had out-
lined with regard to the southern bor-
der.
I am quoting from a White House fact
sheet here, which reads: ‘‘Secured a
number of significant legislative vic-
tories that further the President’s ef-
fort to secure the Southern Border and
protect our country.’’ Chief among
those victories was ‘‘the bill provides
$1.375 billion for approximately 55
miles of border barrier in highly dan-
gerous and drug smuggling areas in the
Rio Grande Valley, where it is des-
perately needed.’’
So we are where we were on February
15 when the administration recognized
that significant gains had been made,
but I think we all know that the Presi-
dent believes very, very strongly that
there is more that should be done, that
must be done, and that will be done to
address that.
Clearly, there was a disagreement be-
tween the Congress and the President
about how much could be spent on bor-
der security in 2019. I think, in fair-
ness, sticking up for Congress’s power
of the purse doesn’t necessarily mean
that it comes at the expense of border
security. I believe very strongly we can

address the President’s concerns—the
very, very real and legitimate concerns
that need to be addressed—but that we
don’t have to do it at the expense of
ceding that authority, of ceding that
power of the purse, of ceding that arti-
cle I power that we have here.
There are ways that the President
can advance his issues, and he has done
so. He, certainly, has the prerogative
to ask for supplemental appropriations.
He has identified additional funding
that is outside of the national emer-
gency designation, or declaration, if
you will.
He has identified additional fund-
ing—close to $3 billion—from other
statutory authorities. These are the
authorities under 10 U.S.C. 284(b),
which is the counterdrug account,
counterdrug funds. That will require a
level of reprogramming through the ap-
propriating committees, but that can
be done outside of the national emer-
gency. The other source of funding is
the Treasury Forfeiture Fund through
the Secretary of the Treasury under 31
U.S.C. 9705. So I think it is clear that
there are avenues to enhance the fund-
ing opportunities to address the situa-
tion at the border.
The concern that many of us have
raised is the designation in this third
account—the designation of a national
emergency—that would tap into funds
that have already been designated for
military construction projects, impor-
tant construction projects that have
been designated around the country.
We certainly have many in my State of
Alaska. We haven’t seen the list that
would perhaps outline with greater ar-
ticulation where the Secretary of De-
fense might think it would be appro-
priate to delay some of these projects.
But, again, I would just remind—these
are projects that have perhaps already
been delayed because of the Budget
Control Act that has been in place for
several years, so I think further delay
for many of these projects would cause
most concern.
So I come to the National Emer-
gencies Act. I think there is a recogni-
tion that when this was adopted, was
put into law, it was initially intended
to rein in the President’s ability to de-
clare emergencies. But at the same
time it authorized the President to de-
clare national emergencies, it didn’t
ever clearly define the extent of that
power. So that is an issue that I think
we are dealing with right now. Implicit
in this grant is the trust that the
power will be used sparingly. I think
that if you look back over the history,
the 59 previous times these powers
have been utilized, you can say they
have been used sparingly. But also ex-
plicit is the authority for the Congress
to terminate an emergency if the Con-
gress believes it was imprudently de-
clared, and that is basically where we
are today.
Because Congress did not explicitly
constrain the President’s power to de-
clare an emergency, many of the con-
stitutional scholars—those who are
trying to game this out—believe the
President will ultimately prevail in the
litigation that we are entirely certain
will be seen in the courts.
The question for us to consider in
this body is not whether the President
could have declared an emergency but
whether he should have and, again, the
question relating to the redirection of
military construction funds from our
bases around the country to the south-
ern border. These are the questions we
are currently debating. But in the final
analysis, I look at the issue we have in
front of us, and this is really a very
challenging place for us as a Congress,
to be debating the constitutional pow-
ers of the Congress against a legisla-
tive agenda—a strong legislative agen-
da and an important one that the
President has. But I have come to be
quite concerned about where we are
when it comes to precedent and the
precedent that we may see unleashed.
In many ways, I view this as an expan-
sion of Executive powers by legislative
acquiescence.
If we fail to weigh in, if we fail to ac-
knowledge that this designation has
gone beyond that which has previously
been considered, if we go around, effec-
tively, the will of Congress, where will
it take us next? I think we need to
think about that because it is so easy
to get focused on where we are in the
here and now and the situation we are
dealing with today, but when we are
pushing out those lanes of congres-
sional authority, I think we need to be
thinking clearly about what that may
mean for future administrations and
for future Congresses.
As the chairman of the Energy and
Natural Resources Committee, my
focus is very often on the energy sec-
tor, on the energy space, and so I have
asked, if we were in a situation with a
new President, what could be invoked
if a new President should decide to ex-
ercise his or her emergency authorities
as they relate to energy? It is entirely
possible that a future President could
declare a national emergency related
to global climate change, speaking to a
humanitarian crisis and what it might
mean for national security. In fact, one
of our colleagues from Massachusetts
has already said as much—that a na-
tional emergency could be declared as
relates to global climate change.
You have to ask the question. What
would stop a future President from de-
claring an emergency and then direct-
ing the military to spend billions of
dollars on renewable projects or ref-
ugee assistance? What is to stop a fu-
ture President from targeting the Na-
tion’s oil and gas supply by cutting off
exports and shutting down production
on the Outer Continental Shelf?
I think we would all say: Well, we
don’t need to worry about that hap-
pening with our current President; he
is not going to do any of those things.
But the authorities technically would
exist for all of them, and so it is con-
cerning. It is concerning to me that a
future President could use that to
drive their agenda—again, without the
consent of the Congress.
So I repeat—I am concerned that, as
a Congress, as a legislative body, we
would stand back and we would acqui-
esce in the use of a national emergency
to resolve a disagreement between the
executive and the legislative branches
over the appropriate level of funding
for a situation that likely exceeds what
can be spent in our current fiscal year.
I know there will be continued dis-
cussion not only here in the Senate, in
the Congress, but certainly around the
country about these matters. I know
some of my colleagues are interested in
revisiting the scope of the National
Emergencies Act, and that is clearly
worth considering. But I firmly believe
that one can be strongly for border se-
curity and at the same time question
whether the administration has over-
reached in using the National Emer-
gencies Act in the way that it has, and
I find myself in that camp. That is why
it is with great resolve that I support
the adoption of the resolutions of dis-
approval.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The legislative clerk proceeded to

NOMINATION OF CHAD A. READLER
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I come to the floor to oppose the
nomination of Chad Readler to the
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and to
urge my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle to oppose this nomination as well.
We have learned that both Senators
from Ohio—one a Democrat and one a
Republican—had previously proposed
mutually agreeable candidates to fill
the Sixth Circuit Court position, but
despite that prior support, the Trump
administration instead nominated
somebody who did not have the support
from both Senators, which is a device
we use to try to encourage nomina-
tions that are not way out of the main-
stream. We want judicial nominees who
are not on the far right nor on any
other extreme. Yet this administration
decided to ignore that bipartisan sup-
port and nominated Mr. Readler for the
position on the Sixth Circuit Court of
Appeals.
Mr. Readler, unfortunately, has a
record that falls well out of the judicial
mainstream. I am very concerned
about the kind of judicial reasoning
and findings he will make as a member
of the Sixth Circuit, if he is confirmed.
He has been the Trump administra-
tion’s point man at the Department of
Justice to try to destroy the Affordable
Care Act and eliminate the protections
the Affordable Care Act has brought to
tens of millions of Americans, includ-
ing protections for people with pre-
existing health conditions—whether it

be a child with asthma, or somebody
with diabetes, or anybody who has a
preexisting condition health condition.
Before the Affordable Care Act was
passed, insurance companies would say
either we are not going to insure you
because you are going to be too expen-
sive to treat or we will provide cov-
erage but only at this price, and then
they would quote a price the person
couldn’t possibly afford.
The Affordable Care Act did away
with that discrimination based on pre-
existing conditions. Yet at the Depart-
ment of Justice, this nominee, Mr.
Readler, was the point person in trying
to reimpose discrimination based on
preexisting conditions.
Why do we say that? Because over
the last couple of years there was a
lawsuit filed in the State of Texas. It
was filed by the attorney general of the
State of Texas and a number of other
attorneys general from other States
around the country—Republican attor-
neys general—that went after the Af-
fordable Care Act. They argued that
once the Congress passed legislation
eliminating the penalties for the man-
dates, all the rest of the law collapsed.
It is a position most legal scholars
from all sides of the political spectrum
think is an absurd legal conclusion
that will not stand the test of time or
the test of the courts in the long run.
Despite the fact that the conclusion
was way out of the mainstream and di-
rected more out of a political charge to
try to undo the Affordable Care Act,
nevertheless, Mr. Readler filed the case
on behalf of the Justice Department—
not in support of the Affordable Care
Act, which would be the usual practice
of the Department of Justice in pro-
tecting the laws of the United States,
but deciding, first of all, not to protect
it and, secondly, to actively go after
the Affordable Care Act and side main-
ly with the positions of Republican at-
torneys general who were trying to de-
stroy the law.
This was a very unusual position to
take, and many of the career attorneys
at the Department of Justice decided
not to sign their names to the brief
that was filed. They did not want to be
associated with a brief that they
thought was more a political document
than a legal document. In fact, one
very respected career attorney at the
Department of Justice resigned in pro-
test.
Even our colleague, Senator LAMAR
ALEXANDER, said this about the brief
that was filed by the Justice Depart-
ment: It is ‘‘as far-fetched as any I’ve
ever heard.’’
Despite the fact that this was a legal
position far out of the mainstream—
authored by Mr. Readler from his post
at the Department of Justice—never-
theless, he went ahead and filed that
brief. It is totally inconsistent with the
position others claimed they were tak-
ing with respect to protecting people
with preexisting health conditions. In
fact, President Trump tweeted repeat-
edly that he wanted to protect people
with preexisting health conditions.
Many of our Republican colleagues in
this Chamber in the Senate, and in the
House, said they don’t like some parts
of the Affordable Care Act, but they
want to protect people with preexisting
conditions from discrimination by in-
surance companies. Yet the Texas law-
suit dismantles the Affordable Care
Act top to bottom, including getting
rid of provisions that protect people
with preexisting conditions.
I think it is important to remind peo-
ple what that means because it means
children with expensive, chronic med-
ical conditions will no longer be able to
get that kind of coverage.
We also know that before the Afford-
able Care Act, insurance companies
had arbitrary annual caps early in each
year. So if a child had a chronic condi-
tion and the costs of helping that child,
providing medical attention to that
child, began to build up, they would
sometimes hit that cap before their
fifth birthday, and then the family
would be on its own. People were pay-
ing health plans for coverage and serv-
ices they needed, only to discover in
the fine print that coverage really
wasn’t there for them when they need-
ed it, and women who became pregnant
found that their insurance plans would
not cover any of their prenatal care or
deliveries. Many of our fellow Ameri-
cans were diagnosed with cancer only
to discover that their plans did not
cover chemotherapy.
When the Texas attorney general,
with a cohort of other Republican at-
torneys general, filed that lawsuit
against the Affordable Care Act, they
filed a lawsuit that put a dagger in the
heart of the consumer protections and
patient protections we had in the Af-
fordable Care Act. It was Mr. Readler
who didn’t come to the defense of the
law for the Department of Justice but
in fact went after the Affordable Care
Act and sided with the attorneys gen-
eral in Texas.
Indeed, there was a U.S. district
court judge in Texas who went along
with these legal arguments. What that
means is, the case is now traveling
through the Federal court system. It
will go to the circuit courts and may
end up at the Supreme Court. So I
would hope our colleagues on both
sides of the aisle who say they want
judges who are going to do the right
thing and call the balls and strikes as
they see them and who have also said
they support protections for people
with preexisting health conditions
would be nervous about putting some-
one on the court who says the law re-
quires them to take the opposite posi-
tion of what our colleagues say they
support right now.
As we approach this vote, make no
mistake, in many ways, this is a vote
on the future of protections for people
with preexisting health conditions.
Unfortunately, Mr. Readler has also
taken a position on discrimination
issues that is very troublesome on
other fronts, specifically with respect
to LGBT rights. Under his leadership,
in his office, the Department of Justice
submitted a brief in the case of Zarda
v. Altitude Express. In that case,
Zarda, who was an employee, alleged
that his company had fired him be-
cause of his sexual orientation, and the
Department of Justice did not take the
side against the right of employers to
discriminate based on sexual orienta-
tion. What they argued was that title
VII of the Civil Rights Act does not
cover discrimination based on sexual
orientation.
Fortunately, in a rare en banc deci-
sion, the Second Circuit Court of Ap-
peals held that the LGBT community
is protected as a class under the Civil
Rights Act, but, unfortunately, be-
cause of a circuit split surrounding this
issue, it is likely to go up through the
court system and find its way to the
Supreme Court. The position he took
on behalf of the Trump Justice Depart-
ment is a telltale sign of where Mr.
Readler stands on questions of whether
the law protects people who have been
discriminated against.
I should say this is not a new issue.
For many of us, there have been efforts
in Congress to address this issue. In my
State of Maryland, in 2001, we passed
an anti-discrimination act that says it
is illegal to discriminate against peo-
ple based on their sexual orientation in
housing, in employment, and in public
accommodations. I recall that the bill
was filibustered late into the evening
by Republican State legislators, but
fortunately for Marylanders it passed.
I am also concerned about Mr. Re-
adler’s record in taking the side of to-
bacco companies during his time as a
partner at Jones Day, specifically R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Company. Like
many of us here, I have worked for
many years—first, in the Maryland
State Legislature and since then in the
U.S. Congress—to curb tobacco use, es-
pecially among young people. I hope we
all agree we don’t want young people
to get hooked on tobacco products or
to get hooked on nicotine, which we
know is very bad for their health and
could very likely kill them in the long
run. Yet Mr. Readler took the position
of the tobacco companies, defining this
issue simply as one of the need to have
somebody who would stick up for spe-
cial interests even when it was against
the public health interests of the
American people.
He represented the tobacco giants in
a number of cases—product liability
cases and commercial speech cases. In
one example, the city of Buffalo, up in
New York, passed a ban on tobacco ads
within 1,000 feet of facilities frequented
by children, like schools, playgrounds,
and daycare centers. The purpose of
that local ordinance was, of course, to
prevent kids from seeing these ads and
saying: Hey, that looks like something
I want to do. Let’s try this tobacco
product. Maybe it is a candy-flavored
tobacco product, maybe it is another
tobacco product. The whole point of
the ordinance was to protect the health
of kids. Yet Mr. Readler fought against
that local ordinance.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1652 March 5, 2019
The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids,
which is an organization that rarely, if
ever, gets involved in judicial nomina-
tions, has found the position Mr.
Readler took on behalf of these tobacco
companies so far out and so extreme
that they have taken the position of
opposing the nomination.
So whether it is fighting to dis-
mantle protections for people with pre-
existing conditions, as Mr. Readler did
from his perch in the Trump Depart-
ment of Justice, or whether it is the
positions he took as a lawyer for the
tobacco industry, trying to knock
down local ordinances and other laws
to protect kids from tobacco and get-
ting addicted to nicotine, or the posi-
tion he has taken not to prevent dis-
crimination but to say our laws do not
protect people against basic forms of
discrimination, in my view, Mr.
Readler is disqualified from taking a
position on a court where the goal of
every justice, regardless of who ap-
points them, should be justice itself
and making sure everybody who comes
before that court gets a fair shake.
They should not be positions based on
the power of a special interest like the
tobacco lobby, and it should not be a
decision based on political slogans or
political promises. Rather, it should be
based on the law itself. So I urge my
colleagues to oppose this nomination.
Even among nominees who are very
far to the right and who take a very re-
stricted view of our rights and lib-
erties, this is a nominee who finds him-
self way outside the mainstream.
I urge my colleagues to oppose the
nomination of Mr. Readler.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise
to announce my opposition to the nom-
ination of Chad Readler to be a Judge
on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.
As the Acting Assistant Attorney
General of the Justice Department’s
Civil Division, Mr. Readler was both a
lead attorney and policy adviser in the
Department’s decision not to defend
the Affordable Care Act, including its
provisions protecting individuals with
preexisting conditions.
Rather than defend the law and its
protections for individuals with pre-
existing conditions, such as asthma,
arthritis, cancer, diabetes, and heart
disease, Mr. Readler’s brief in Texas v.
United States argued that they should
be invalidated.
I strongly objected to DOJ’s position
to not defend the law, and it is telling
that this position also concerned some
other career attorneys in the Depart-
ment. In fact, three career attorneys
withdrew from the case rather than
support this position, and one of those
attorneys eventually resigned.
In my view, the Justice Department’s
severability argument is wrong and im-
plausible. On June 27, 2018, I wrote to
Attorney General Sessions and urged
the Justice Department to reverse
course and to defend the law’s critical
protections for individuals with pre-
existing conditions. Even the Justice
Department acknowledged that it was
‘‘rare’’ for the government to refuse to
defend the laws of the United States
against constitutional challenges.
I have continuously stressed the im-
portance of protecting Americans who
suffer from preexisting conditions, in-
cluding 45 percent of Maine’s popu-
lation: 590,000 Mainers. In July 2017, I
voted to block several proposals to re-
peal the ACA, which I feared would re-
duce protections for individuals with
preexisting conditions. In October 2018,
I voted to overturn a Trump adminis-
tration rule that expands the duration
of short-term health insurance plans,
which could deny coverage to people
with preexisting conditions.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, I ask

Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, I ask

NOMINATION OF ALLISON JOAN RUSHING
Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, I
come to the floor to thank my col-
leagues who voted and who will be vot-
ing to move forward the nomination of
Allison Joan Rushing to be the U.S.
Circuit Court judge for the Fourth Cir-
cuit.
Ms. Rushing has a great history in
North Carolina. She is actually from
East Flat Rock, NC. Both of her par-
ents were educators who taught in the
North Carolina public school system.
She received her degree with honors
from Wake Forest, and she received her
law degree from Duke University. She
now has over 11 years of experience
practicing law and is really considered
one of the fast-rising stars of the legal
profession.
I have had the opportunity to get to
know Ms. Rushing through the nomi-
nation process, and I know she is going
to do a great job as a circuit court
judge on the Fourth Circuit.
From the ABA, she has received from
a substantial majority a ‘‘qualified’’
rating and from a minority a ‘‘well
qualified’’ rating. She is clearly quali-
fied to do this job. She is young. She is
bright. She is a topnotch litigator, and
I look forward to casting my vote here
in a couple of minutes. Again, I think
my colleagues will also be casting a
vote in support of confirming this nom-
ination.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under
the previous order, all postcloture time
has expired.
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Rushing nomi-
nation?
Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, I ask
for the yeas and nays.

CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, in
California, several counties and cities
are suing the big oil companies to hold
them liable for the damages that cli-
mate change is causing to the infra-
structure out there. As judges consider
these cases, one thing they will be
asked to keep in mind is Big Oil’s his-
tory of deception and lies.
A group of scientific experts filed
this friend-of-the-court brief out in the
Ninth Circuit, carefully charting that
history, that pattern of deception and
lies. The group of scholars and sci-
entists chronicled how the fossil fuel
companies had actual knowledge of the
risks of their products and had taken
‘‘proactive steps to conceal their
knowledge and discredit climate
science’’ while at the same time taking
steps based on that science to protect
their own assets from the impacts of
climate change.
It is a 51-page document, so let me
cut to the chase. Big Oil knew for a
very long time that the production and
burning of fossil fuels would be disas-
trous for the planet. Yet they did ev-
erything in their power to confuse the
public, undermine the scientific evi-
dence of the dangers, and prevent ac-
tion to stave off this worldwide prob-
lem. The brief makes a fascinating
read. Here are some highlights.
Way back in 1959, when I was a kid
and Dwight Eisenhower was President,
Columbia University held a symposium
attended by oil industry executives to
mark the 100th anniversary of the pe-
troleum industry. At that event, the
legendary Dr. Edward Teller, a physi-
cist, warned the industry about global
warming. He said:
[A] temperature rise corresponding to a 10
percent increase in carbon dioxide will be
sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge
New York. . . . [T]his chemical contamina-
tion is more serious than most people tend
to believe.
In 1959. A few years later, in 1965, at
the American Petroleum Institute’s
annual meeting, API president Frank
Ikard briefed the Big Oil trade group
on a report from President Johnson’s
Science Advisory Committee that pre-
dicted significant global warming by
the end of the century, caused by fossil
fuels, and warned that ‘‘there is still
time to save the world’s peoples from
the catastrophic consequence of pollu-
tion, but time is running out.’’ The
American Petroleum Institute, 1965.
API then commissioned a Stanford
Research Institute report on the cli-
mate problem which was made avail-
able to its membership in 1968. The re-
port said:
[R]ising levels of CO2 would likely result in
rising global temperatures. . . . [T]he result
could be melting ice caps, rising sea levels,
warming oceans, and serious environmental
damage on a global scale.
Then, in 1969, Stanford produced a
supplemental report for the American
Petroleum Institute. As the authors of
this brief tell the Ninth Circuit, ‘‘The
report projected that . . . atmospheric
CO2 concentrations would reach 370
[parts per million] by 2000—exactly
what it turned out to be.’’ That was
1968 and 1969, very clear warnings that
have come to pass.
Big Oil did not just rely on the Amer-
ican Petroleum Institute to do its re-
search on climate change. Ed Garvey
was an Exxon scientist at the time. Mr.
Garvey said:
By the late 1970s, global warming was no
longer speculative.
Did you get that? ‘‘By the late 1970s,
global warming was no longer specula-
tive,’’ said the Exxon scientist.
The issue was not were we going to
have a problem, the issue was simply
how soon and how fast and how bad was
it going to be. Not if.
Indeed, Exxon did a lot of climate re-
search, and they understood the
science well. A 1979 internal Exxon
study found that:
[The] increase [in CO2 concentration] is
due to fossil fuel combustion . . . and the
present trend of fossil fuel consumption will
cause dramatic environmental effects before
the year 2050.
Meanwhile—back to the American
Petroleum Institute—they had put to-
gether a task force on what they called
the CO2 problem. In 1980, Dr. John
Laurman told this API task force that
‘‘foreseeable temperature increases
could have major economic con-
sequences [and] globally catastrophic
effects.’’ The American Petroleum In-
stitute, 1980.
Back at Exxon, Roger Cohen, the di-
rector of Exxon’s Theoretical and
Mathematical Sciences Laboratory,
warned in 1981—the next year—about
the magnitude of this problem.
[I]t is distinctly possible that [Exxon’s
planning] scenario will later produce effects
which will indeed be catastrophic (at least
for a substantial fraction of the earth’s popu-
lation).
In 1982, Roger Cohen reiterated his
warning:
Over the past several years a clear sci-
entific consensus has emerged regarding—
This is 1982—
the expected climatic effects of increased at-
mospheric CO2.
He continues:
[There is] unanimous agreement in the sci-
entific community that a temperature in-
crease of this magnitude would bring about
significant changes in the earth’s climate.
Unanimous agreement in the sci-
entific community.
In 1982, Exxon’s own scientist said
this, but almost four decades later, the
Trump administration pretends that
we just don’t know. Well, we do know.
Back to the brief. In 1982, an internal
Exxon corporate primer said that, in
order to mitigate the effects of global
warming, ‘‘[there is a need for] major
reductions in fossil fuel combustion.
. . . [T]here are some potentially cata-
strophic events that must be consid-
ered. . . . [O]nce the effects are meas-
urable, they might not be reversible.’’
So on into the late seventies and the
early eighties, they knew.
This is from a 1998 report by Shell
Oil’s Greenhouse Effect Working
Group:
Man-made carbon dioxide, released into
and accumulated in the atmosphere, is be-
lieved to warm the earth through the so-
called greenhouse effect. . . . [B]y the time
the global warming becomes detectible it
could be too late to take effective counter-
measures to reduce the effects or even to
stabilise the situation.
So, long story short, Big Oil knew,
API knew, Exxon knew, Shell knew.
They knew, but Big Oil also realized
that understanding climate change
meant limiting carbon emissions, and
that meant less oil sales. So they

began to tell something very different
than what they knew to the public.
A 1998 Exxon internal memo ac-
knowledged that the ‘‘greenhouse ef-
fect may be one of the most significant
environmental issues for the 1990s,’’
but Exxon’s position would be to try to
‘‘[e]mphasize the uncertainty in sci-
entific conclusions regarding the po-
tential enhanced Greenhouse effect,’’
and that became the drumbeat of the
industry: minimize the danger—the one
they knew—that the greenhouse effect
may be one of the most significant en-
vironmental issues for the 1990s but, in-
stead, undermine the science.
So the industry set up front groups
with innocuous-sounding names like
the Global Climate Coalition or the In-
formation Council on the Environment
to do this PR work for it. The sci-
entific brief notes this bit of industry
propaganda from 1996 from the so-
called Global Climate Coalition: ‘‘If
there is an anthropogenic component
to this observed warming, the GCC be-
lieves that it must be very small.’’
Well, here is what an earlier draft of
the same document said: ‘‘[The] sci-
entific basis for the Greenhouse Effect
and the potential impacts of human
emissions of greenhouse gases such as
CO2 on climate is well established and
cannot be denied.’’
They just weren’t telling the truth.
They knew, and they said things they
knew were not true.
Money poured from the oil industry
into these denialist groups. In 1991, the
so-called Information Council on the
Environment launched a nationwide
campaign with one goal, to ‘‘reposition
global warming as theory (not fact).’’
This thing they said was well estab-
lished and cannot be denied, they de-
cided to reposition as theory, not fact.
The polluters kept this up all the
way through the 1990s. A 1998 American
Petroleum Institute strategy memo
tells what they wanted people to be-
lieve, even though they knew it wasn’t
true. They said: ‘‘[It is] not known for
sure whether (a) climate change is ac-
tually occurring, or (b) if it is, whether
humans really have any influence on
it.’’
Again, well established, cannot be de-
nied on the one hand and not sure
whether it is occurring or whether hu-
mans have anything to do with it on
the other hand.
Here is Martin Hoffert, who was an
Exxon scientist for 20 years. He said:
Even though we—
‘‘We,’’ meaning the Exxon scientists.
Even though we were writing all these pa-
pers . . . [saying] that climate change from
CO2 emissions was going to change the cli-
mate of the earth . . . the front office—
The front office said otherwise.
. . . the front office which was concerned
with promoting the products of the company
was also supporting people that we call cli-
mate change deniers.
So even as they spun this massive
fraud out to the public, Big Oil inter-
nally took the evidence of climate
change seriously. They took the evi-
dence of climate change seriously
enough to factor it into their own plan-
et. So while they were telling the pub-
lic ‘‘This isn’t for real, and we don’t
have anything to do it with, and the
science isn’t secure,’’ they were doing
their own planning based on that very
science.
For instance, in designing and build-
ing the Sable gas field project off the
shores of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Mobil,
Shell, and Imperial Oil explicitly told
their own engineers about sea level
rise. They said that ‘‘[a]n estimated
rise . . . due to global warming, of 0.5
meters may be assumed.’’
Big Oil protected its own assets
against predicted sea level rise based
on this science, while, at the same
time, funding a massive campaign of
deception to fool the public and policy-
makers about this science. They pro-
tected themselves, and they connived
to prevent the public from taking steps
to protect itself.
There are some unsung heroes in this
climate battle. Among them number
the dedicated and assiduous group of
scholars and scientists who track this
climate denial apparatus that this in-
dustry built. Many of them are the au-
thors of this brief, such as Robert
Brule, Justin Farrell, Benjamin
Franta, Stephan Lewandowsky, Naomi
Oreskes, and Geoffrey Supran. They
are just a few. There are many, many
others who are watching, examining,
reporting, and subject to a peer review
chronicling the climate denial appa-
ratus set up by the oil industry to fool
the public. They patiently and thor-
oughly assembled in their brief a
record of industry malfeasance, and
they are helping to make sure that the
long history of industry deception is
part of the court’s official record.
I thank them for their work.

NOMINATION OBJECTION
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
intend to object to any unanimous con-
sent request relating to the nomina-
tion of William R. Evanina to be Direc-
tor of the National Counterintelligence
and Security Center, PN192.
When I noticed my intention to place
a hold on this nominee back in June of
2018, I made it very clear to the public
and to the administration my reasons
for doing so, and I put my statement of
those reasons in the RECORD. I have
done that consistently, not only since
the rules of the Senate require every
Member to do that, but even before
that rule was ever put in place.
I continue to experience difficulties
obtaining relevant documents and
briefings from the Justice Department
and the Office of the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence, ODNI, related to
2016 election controversies. On several
occasions, Deputy Attorney General,
DAG, Rod Rosenstein has personally
assured me that the Senate Judiciary
Committee would receive equal access
to information provided to the House
Permanent Select Committee on Intel-
ligence, HPSCI, with regard to any
concessions in its negotiations regard-
ing pending subpoenas from that com-
mittee. However, I and the Judiciary
Committee have not received equal ac-
cess.
For example, on August 7, 2018, I
wrote to the Justice Department and
pointed out that the House Intelligence
Committee had received documents re-
lated to Bruce Ohr that we had not re-
ceived. The Department initially de-
nied those records had been provided to
the House Intelligence Committee.
After my staff confronted the Depart-
ment, we eventually received some
Bruce Ohr documents. In that 2018 let-
ter I have referred to, I asked for docu-
ments based on my equal access agree-
ment with Deputy Attorney General
Rosenstein, and I have not received a
response to date.
I have since learned that the Justice
Department has taken the position
that Director Coats has prohibited
them from sharing the requested
records with the committee.
In addition to the records request, in
May 2018, the Director of National In-
telligence and the Justice Department
provided a briefing in connection with
a pending House Intel subpoena to
which no Senate Judiciary Committee
member was invited.
Thus far, the committee’s attempts
to schedule an equivalent briefing have
been ignored.
The administration’s continued, on-
going, and blatant lack of cooperation
has forced my hand. I must object to
any consideration of this nomination.
In the authorizing resolution that
created the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence, SSCI, the Senate ex-
plicitly reserves for other standing
committees, such as the Senate Judici-
ary Committee, independent authority
to ‘‘study and review any intelligence
or intelligence-related activity’’ and
‘‘to obtain full and prompt access to
the product of the intelligence and in-
telligence-related activities of a de-
partment or agency,’’ when such a

matter ‘‘directly affects a matter oth-
erwise within the jurisdiction of that
committee,’’ S. Res. 400. As I under-
stand it, the information at issue here
falls into that category.
Thus, unfortunately, I must object to
any consideration of this nomination.
My objection is not intended to ques-
tion the credentials of Mr. Evanina in
any way. This objection falls squarely
on the administration’s continued fail-
ure to uphold their end of the agree-
ment. The executive branch must rec-
ognize that it has an ongoing obliga-
tion to respond to congressional inquir-
ies in a timely and reasonable manner.

TRIBUTE TO BILL BAIRD
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
this year, the University of Pikeville in
my home State will mark its 130th
year of service to students in the
mountains of central Appalachia. For
more than half of that time, a member
of the Baird family has served the
school, its community, and most im-
portantly, its students. After three
decades of service, Bill Baird recently
retired from the UPIKE board of trust-
ees. In recognition of his legacy of
leadership, mentorship, and accom-
plishment, UPIKE President Burton J.
Webb awarded my friend with the inau-
gural Baird Family Service Award. So,
I would like to take a moment today to
pay tribute to Bill Baird and his family
for their steadfast contributions to
eastern Kentucky.
Bill’s family is deeply rooted in this
region with history going back nearly
a century. His father, William J. Baird
II, grew up on a farm in the Bluegrass
State before attending Berea College.
In 1947, William hung a shingle, found-
ing Baird & Baird law firm. Outside of
his professional success, William dedi-
cated much of his life to philanthropy
and leadership, serving on the board of
trustees of Pikeville Community Col-
lege for nearly three decades. In grati-
tude for his service to the Pikeville
community and the central Appa-
lachian region, William received an
honorary doctor of humanities degree
in 1977 from Pikeville College, UPIKE’s
name until 2011. Bill’s mother, Florane,
attended the Pikeville Collegiate Insti-
tute, a high school that later became
part of the modern UPIKE. Through
her care and compassion for the com-
munity, Florane also received an hon-
orary doctorate from Pikeville College.
Bill lovingly remembered them both as
service-oriented people, and their influ-
ence, paired with a deep faith, inspired
his work for the Pikeville community
and the school.
Working in the mines while studying
at Pikeville College, Bill graduated in
1966. He later earned admission to the
bar and served our country in the U.S.
Army. Reentering private life, Bill
worked at the family law firm and was
eventually joined by his brothers,
Charles and John, and members of the
family’s next generation.
Even as he worked full time at Baird
& Baird, Bill seemed to find extra
hours in the day for his community.
With leadership roles at UPIKE, in his
church, and at Westcare of Kentucky—
a substance abuse treatment facility—
Bill constantly gave of himself to oth-
ers. He coached the local high school’s
softball team for nearly two decades
and the UPIKE team from 1994–2004,
even receiving admission into the uni-
versity’s athletic hall of fame. After he
retired from the practice, Bill hardly
slowed down. He did so much pro bono
work that he quipped, ‘‘Some people
say I’m the only retired person they
know who comes in to the office every
day.’’
When asked about his impact on the
school, the chairman of UPIKE’s board
said Bill gave ‘‘of his time, talent, and
treasure to the university at a level
few have ever given, and he has done so
with an unmatched sense of love and
care.’’ A great deal of Bill’s support fo-
cused on first-time college students
from the local community to foster the
potential of Pikeville families. In addi-
tion to creating the award named in
the Baird family’s honor, the board of
trustees also unanimously voted to es-
tablish the Bill Baird Family Scholar-
ship to improve student retention and
to help provide for students who may
struggle to afford their education.
Bill’s not the only impressive mem-
ber of his household. Kaye, his wife,
spent much of her career contributing
to the community, helping lead organi-
zations like the chamber of commerce,
the school board, and the Christian Ap-
palachian Project. Excelling as an edu-
cator, she touched the lives of numer-
ous eastern Kentucky children and
earned her place in the inaugural class
of UPIKE’s Distinguished Educators
Hall of Fame.
Bill and Kaye have done so much for
their community, with compassion,
philanthropy, and leadership. I am so
proud to pay tribute to the Baird fam-
ily. They have earned our thanks and
have made a lasting impact on this re-
gion. I am glad the Baird family name
has rightfully earned a place of honor
at UPIKE, and I ask each of my Senate
colleagues to join me in congratulating
Bill and Kaye for a lifetime of dedi-
cated service to Kentucky.
The UPIKE Magazine published a
profile on Bill’s contributions to the
school. I ask unanimous consent that
the article be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:

THE BAIRD FAMILY LEGACY: BILL BAIRD
HONORED FOR EMBODIMENT OF SERVICE
(By Mark Baggett)
‘‘Our dad was a great teacher in treating
people right,’’ says Bill Baird about his fa-
ther, William J. Baird II, and about the
heart of the Baird family’s long legacy of
support for UPIKE students.
Among the many stories of the family’s
support, a remarkable statistic stands out: A
Baird has been serving at UPIKE for over
half of the 129 years of its existence. During
the 2018 opening convocation ceremony,
President Burton J. Webb, Ph.D., honored
UPIKE Trustee Emeritus Bill Baird with the
inaugural Baird Family Service Award, in
recognition of his remarkable impact on the
lives of others through steadfast service to
the university, to the Appalachian region
and to all humanity.
‘‘In 2019, we will celebrate 130 years of serv-
ice in the mountains of Central Appalachia,’’
says Webb. ‘‘During that span of time few
families have impacted the college more
than the Baird family. Bill Baird has taken
the legacy of servant leadership from his
mother, father, and brother even further. He
has been a softball coach, a friend of the uni-
versity and an ardent supporter of the uni-
versity for decades.’’
After more than 30 years of distinguished
service Bill Baird retired from the UPIKE
Board of Trustees, which was also served by
Bill’s father and brother, Charles. In recogni-
tion of Bill Baird’s indelible contributions,
the board voted unanimously to establish
and fund the Bill Baird Family Scholarship
to improve student retention by filling fi-
nancial gaps for students.
‘‘You pick up the need down here,’’ says
Bill Baird. ‘‘There is a gap between the edu-
cated part of the community and the work-
ing class such as the retired coal miners or
people on fixed incomes.’’
UPIKE Board Chairman Terry L. Dotson
has witnessed the fruits of Bill Baird’s self-
lessness for decades.
‘‘The entire Baird family is a treasure to
Eastern Kentucky and to the University of
Pikeville,’’ Dotson says. ‘‘Bill is an excep-
tional person in every way. He is someone
every good person strives to be. Bill cares
about all things—his church, family and
community. He has been a special board
member who has fully given of his time, tal-
ent and treasure to the university at a level
few have ever given, and he has done so with
an unmatched sense of love and care. Bill is
my friend and has served our board with dis-
tinction.’’
Dotson’s sentiments are echoed by UPIKE
Trustee Richard A. Sturgill. ‘‘Bill Baird has
been an inspiration to me and many others
in the UPIKE community. His unwavering
positive attitude, his willingness to encour-
age and mentor the students and his ability
to always stand up for what is right has been
steadfast. I am thankful to call him my
friend,’’ says Sturgill.
Bill Baird says the university and medical
and optometry colleges are ‘‘miracles.’’
‘‘UPIKE is a light on the hill to this city,
the region and even nationally. To me, what
we are is the answered prayers for the many
people who laid the foundation for this place
by praying for years. These are people who
have sacrificed and dedicated themselves to
the university.’’
Humbly, Bill Baird deflects the spotlight
to his parents. His father, who died in 1987,
was raised on a Kentucky farm and was a
graduate of Berea College and Duke Law
School (a classmate of Richard Nixon). He
also founded in 1947 the Baird & Baird law
firm in Pikeville where Bill Baird and his
brothers (Charles and John) as well as chil-
dren, grandchildren and in-laws also prac-
tice. Bill Baird’s mother Florane Justice
Baird, who died in 2011, also had strong
Pikeville roots: She attended the Training
School for grades 1–8 in Pikeville (which op-
erated in the original college building) and
then the Pikeville Collegiate Institute for
high school, before going to the University of
Kentucky.
‘‘My parents were very service-oriented
people,’’ says Bill Baird. ‘‘They were giving,
caring people who gave back to their com-
munity.’’
Bill Baird started at Duke University as an
undergraduate and says he ‘‘made an A in
fraternity and an A in football,’’ and soon he

returned to the Pikeville area and worked in
the mines, graduated from Pikeville college
in 1966. He was admitted to the Kentucky bar
in 1969 and served in the U.S. Army from
1969–1971.
A life-transforming event happened to him
in the spring of 1973 when heard the Rev. Ben
Sheldon, who was then a Presbyterian pastor
in Washington, D.C., preach in Pikeville.
‘‘He started preaching the gospel of God’s
love,’’ Baird says of Sheldon, who later be-
came a pastor in Pikeville. ‘‘I felt a personal
love that He died for me. It was God’s tim-
ing.’’
Baird went on to practice law in Pikeville,
joking that ‘‘in Hatfield and McCoy country,
folks can be litigious here.’’ He now de-
scribes his role as a ‘‘sometime’’ attorney,
not full-time nor part-time, who does pro
bono work and helps fill in for other attor-
neys at court appearances. ‘‘Some people say
I’m the only retired person they know who
comes in to the office every day,’’ he says.
He followed up on his short ‘‘athletic’’ ca-
reer at Duke by coaching softball at
Pikeville High School from 1986–2004 and at
the university from 1994–2004. Today one of
the family’s scholarships is dedicated to ath-
letics, and Bill Baird himself is a member of
the university’s Athletic Hall of Fame.
Much of the family’s UPIKE support is de-
scribed by Bill Baird as meeting the needs of
first-time college students who come from
the community. He says he hopes the schol-
arships will address larger gaps as well.
To meet additional need in his region, Bill
Baird has been actively involved in several
faith-based groups and community support
programs. He has supported the Fellowship
of Christian Athletes program, provided de-
votional Bibles to coaches and is Board
Chairman of WestCare of Kentucky, Inc.,
which is involved in treatment of substance
abuse.
Today, the Baird Family Circle is one of
the granite inlays of Benefactor’s Plaza on
campus. Acknowledging the recent service
award and scholarship fund honoring him at
UPIKE, Bill Baird says, ‘‘Christ made the
difference in my life. He gave me an oppor-
tunity to serve in this way.’’
He praises this year’s fellow recipients of
the Baird Family Service award, UPIKE
Trustee Gregory Pauley and his wife, Kath-
ryn, characterizing them as ‘‘wonderful, car-
ing people,’’ whose mobile home park neigh-
borhood ministry is just the kind of gen-
erosity and service embodied by the Baird
legacy.

TRIBUTE TO LINDSAY NOTHERN
Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I
honor my communications director
Lindsay Nothern for his dedication of
more than 20 years to Senate service.
Lindsay has been a valued member of
my staff since we both started Senate
service in 1999. When I was sworn in as
a U.S. Senator, my communications di-
rector refused to hire a press secretary
immediately because she wanted to
bring Lindsay onto the staff, and he
was not available for a few months, so
she did double duty until he was able
to join my staff, and I have always
been grateful for her insistence that we
wait for him. His instincts and media
savvy have been spot-on so many times
over the two decades he has been with
me.
Lindsay’s strategic view of how ac-
tivities and policy initiatives are pre-
sented has been instrumental. From
press secretary, he moved to serving as
communications director in 2011. While
Lindsay may not be an Idahoan by
birth, he has certainly earned his Gem
State stripes through his depth and
breadth of knowledge about the State.
His experience as a journalist has
served him well, first in reporting and
managing the news from the journalist
side and then from the other side as a
press secretary and media representa-
tive. His prior work includes serving as
press secretary for former Idaho Gov-
ernor Phil Batt, who initially dubbed
Lindsay as ‘‘Scoop,’’ and campaign
press secretary for Congressman MIKE
SIMPSON in Congressman SIMPSON’s
first House campaign.
Lindsay is unfailingly one of the
most pleasant people I have ever en-
countered. He can be counted on to be
a great sounding board and listener, re-
gardless of his personal opinions. I
trust him to represent me to Idahoans
throughout the State and know that he
will always leave a meeting with a
handful of new friends. That includes
those who show up angry and unan-
nounced in my office, demanding a
meeting. Lindsay has demonstrated pa-
tience, commitment, and empathy in
meeting for hundreds of hours with
those who have taken issue with some
aspect of government, the administra-
tion, or me. He is also a great
encourager among staff, helping them
to know their good work is valued and
appreciated.
Several issues have become close to
Lindsay’s heart—among them, domes-
tic violence prevention and awareness.
Somewhere in my office archives, there
is a photo of Lindsay in women’s heels
as he took part in a ‘‘walk a mile in
her shoes’’ event, representing the of-
fice. That was not a comfortable expe-
rience for his feet, but he has been a
strong advocate in helping me find
ways to illuminate and bring aware-
ness to domestic violence matters.
Thank you, Lindsay, for your 20
years of dedicated service to our Na-
tion and the people of Idaho, and thank
you for your continual assistance and
friendship over the years. Congratula-
tions on this milestone of public serv-
ice for the betterment of Idaho and our
Nation.

TRIBUTE TO JULIE BROOKER
Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President,
today I would like to recognize Julie
Brooker, my central Nebraska director
of constituent services who retired at
the end of February.
Julie Brooker’s service in the U.S.
Senate began in 1997 and has spanned
three U.S. Senators from Nebraska:
former Senator Chuck Hagel, former
Senator Mike Johanns, and myself.
Before her longtime work as a Senate
staffer, Julie was a committed and
hardworking volunteer on a number of
political campaigns.
She was well known as someone will-
ing to haul yard signs all over Nebras-
ka’s huge third district.
You see, a commitment to helping
and serving others ran in Julie’s fam-
ily.
Julie’s dad, Gordon, served faithfully
as a local volunteer firefighter, and her
mom, Doralene, served on both the
Buffalo County Board of Supervisors
and the Nebraska Public Power Dis-
trict Board.
Their example instilled in her lessons
in treating people with kindness, lis-
tening to others’ concerns, and lending
a helping hand.
If you were planning a run for office
in Nebraska, Julie Brooker was some-
one you needed to go see.
When I decided to run for U.S. Sen-
ate, Julie was one of the first people I
visited with, and she was so very gen-
erous with her time and her advice.
During her Senate career, Julie sac-
rificed many days, nights, and week-
ends to serve the people of Nebraska
well.
She was renowned for driving which-
ever U.S. Senator she was serving at
the time all over the third district.
In every county, Julie had many
friends. Her genuine interest in others
and friendly, approachable demeanor
were always on display.
Over the years Julie worked in my
office, I was always completely con-
fident that she was representing me
well and that my constituents in
Kearney and throughout the central re-
gion of the State were in the very best
of hands.
Whether it was through her tenacity
in helping resolve casework, her will-
ingness to meet with any Nebraskan
who crossed her path, or her ability to
provide tough news in compassionate
ways, Julie has always had a servant’s
heart.
Serving Nebraskans wasn’t a job for
Julie, it was a calling. She loves Ne-
braska, and she loves Nebraskans.
I want to thank Julie’s husband, Jim,
for loaning Julie to the people of cen-
tral Nebraska for so many years.
I am also so very grateful to Julie’s
kids and grandkids for sacrificing time
with her so that she could put the time
and energy she had into this service to
the people of Nebraska.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1657
March 5, 2019
The city of Kearney, the State of Ne-
braska, and the U.S. Senate are better
because of Julie’s wonderful work
throughout the years.
She is a dedicated, committed person
who focused on making life better for
Nebraskans.
She is truly one of a kind.
I congratulate Julie on her remark-
able career in public service. I thank
her for her many years of service to
our State and to our people, and I wish
her a retirement full of joy and fulfill-
ment.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO ANN MITCHELL
∑ Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, today I wish to recognize Ann
Mitchell for her 20 years of outstanding
dedication and visionary leadership as
president and CEO of Montgomery Hos-
pice. I am grateful to Ann for her tire-
less efforts to provide quality and com-
passionate end-of-life care and services
to residents of Montgomery County,
MD.
Ann understands that the experience
of people who are dying is extremely
personal and that each of us has a cul-
tural identity that is part of our char-
acter. When people are in their final
weeks of life, Ann believes that it is
paramount that each of us is cared for
with a deep respect for our cultural
identity.
Ann considers herself a global cit-
izen, as she grew up in seven countries
around the world. She celebrates diver-
sity and recognizes the value that a
multicultural team brings to end-of-
life care. Ann has worked diligently to
make Montgomery Hospice diverse at
all levels, including in senior manage-
ment, and firmly supports inclusion
and equity initiatives.
Montgomery Hospice is well-known
for its inpatient hospice, ‘‘Casey
House’’; its comprehensive ‘‘Hospice at
Home’’ service; and its compassionate
‘‘Bereavement Care’’ service. All Mont-
gomery Hospice services support its
mission ‘‘To Gentle the Journey’’ for
the dying residents of Montgomery
County, MD.
A trustee of Smith College, Ann
graduated with a major in economics
from Smith. She earned a master’s in
public health at Yale University. For
the past 20 years, Ann has led Mont-
gomery Hospice strategically in service
to its patients, employees, and volun-
teers.
I have known Ann for over 20 years,
and I can personally attest to the dedi-
cation and compassion she has brought
to her job. It has been an honor to sup-
port her efforts as she enlisted many in
our community in her important work.
She has been totally committed to her
mission of ensuring that every indi-
vidual in her care is treated with the
utmost respect and dignity, and our
community is stronger and better be-
cause of her work.
I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing all that Ann Mitchell has
done to make a difference in the lives
of others.∑

EMERGENCY THAT WAS DE-
CLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER
13692 OF MARCH 8, 2015, WITH RE-
SPECT TO THE SITUATION IN
VENEZUELA—PM 4
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message
from the President of the United
States, together with an accompanying
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Banking, Housing, and
Urban Affairs.
To the Congress of the United States:
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90
days before the anniversary date of its
declaration, the President publishes in
the Federal Register and transmits to
the Congress a notice stating that the
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to
the Federal Register for publication the
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive
Order 13692 of March 8, 2015, with re-
spect to the situation in Venezuela, is
to continue in effect beyond March 8,
2019.
The situation in Venezuela continues
to pose an unusual and extraordinary
threat to the national security and for-
eign policy of the United States. For
this reason, I have determined that it
is necessary to continue the national
emergency declared in Executive Order
13692 with respect to the situation in
Venezuela.

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
The following petition or memorial
was laid before the Senate and was re-
ferred or ordered to lie on the table as
indicated:
POM–10. A joint resolution adopted by the
Legislature of the State of Maine urging the
United States Congress to pass legislation to
support Federal Employees in Maine affected
by the federal government shutdown; to the
Committee on Appropriations.
H.P. 280
Whereas, the longest partial shutdown in
the history of the United States government
began on December 22, 2018; and
Whereas, the federal government shutdown
is affecting approximately 800,000 federal em-
ployees; and
Whereas, in Maine the workers currently
affected are employees of the Department of
Homeland Security, which includes airport
screening personnel and members of the
United States Coast Guard, and employees of
Acadia National Park; and
Whereas, those federal workers who have
not been furloughed are obliged to work
without pay; and
Whereas, the federal government shutdown
is also having an affect on other industries
in Maine, such as tourism, and small busi-
nesses that depend upon federal regulation
and loan processing; and
Whereas, as the federal government shut-
down continues, there is potential for many
social and housing services in the State to be
negatively affected; and
Whereas, it is important for the economic
health of the State that the federal govern-
ment shutdown cease as quickly as possible;
now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, on
behalf of the people we represent, take this
opportunity to respectfully request that the
United States Congress take immediate
steps to reach a compromise and end the par-
tial shutdown of the Federal Government
and restore financial security to the lives of
citizens; and be it further
Resolved, That suitable copies of this reso-
lution, duly authenticated by the Secretary
of State, be transmitted to the President of
the United States Senate, the Speaker of the
United States House of Representatives and
each Member of the Maine Congressional
Delegation.

SENATE RESOLUTION 93—EX-
PRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE
DESIGNATION OF MARCH 2, 2019,
AS ‘‘GOLD STAR FAMILIES RE-
MEMBRANCE DAY’’
Mr. COTTON (for himself, Mr. JONES,
Mr. MANCHIN, and Ms. MCSALLY) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which
was considered and agreed to:
S. RES. 93
Whereas March 2, 2019, marks the 90th an-
niversary of President Calvin Coolidge sign-
ing an Act of Congress that approved and
funded the first Gold Star pilgrimage to en-
able Gold Star mothers and widows to travel
to the gravesites of their loved ones who died
during World War I;
Whereas the members and veterans of the
Armed Forces bear the burden of protecting
the freedom of the people of the United
States; and
Whereas the sacrifices of the families of
the fallen members and veterans of the
Armed Forces should never be forgotten:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) supports the designation of March 2,
2019, as ‘‘Gold Star Families Remembrance
Day’’;
(2) honors and recognizes the sacrifices
made by the families of veterans and mem-
bers of the Armed Forces who gave their
lives to defend freedom and protect the
United States; and
(3) encourages the people of the United
States to observe Gold Star Families Re-
membrance Day—
(A) by performing acts of service and good
will in their communities; and
(B) by celebrating the lives of those who
have made the ultimate sacrifice so that oth-
ers could continue to enjoy life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness.

Mr. KAINE, Mrs. MURRAY, Mr. MURPHY,
Mr. UDALL, and Mr. WARNER) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which
was referred to the Committee on the
Judiciary:
S. RES. 94
Whereas, in 2010, Congress passed and
President Barack Obama signed the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public
Law 111–148; 124 Stat. 119) (in this preamble
referred to as the ‘‘ACA’’);
Whereas, prior to the enactment of the
ACA, individuals with pre-existing medical
conditions were routinely denied health in-
surance coverage, charged exorbitant rates
for health insurance coverage, exposed to un-
reasonable out-of-pocket costs for health
care, or subject to lifetime limits on health
insurance coverage;
Whereas the ACA instituted comprehensive
protections for individuals with pre-existing
medical conditions, including—
(1) the protection commonly known as
‘‘guaranteed issue’’, which requires health
insurance companies to issue a health plan
to any applicant regardless of health status
or other factors, under section 2702 of the
Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg–1);
(2) the protection commonly known as
‘‘community rating’’, which prohibits health
insurance companies from varying premiums
within a geographical area based on gender
or health status and limits the ability of
health insurance companies to vary pre-
miums based on age, under section 2701 of
the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.
300gg); and
(3) the prohibition on discrimination based
on health status, which prohibits excluding
from a health plan benefits for pre-existing
medical conditions or establishing eligibility
rules based on pre-existing medical condi-
tions, under sections 2704 and 2705(a) of the
Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg–3,
300gg–4(a));

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1662 March 5, 2019
Whereas, on June 7, 2018, pursuant to sec-
tion 530D of title 28, United States Code,
then Attorney General Jefferson Sessions,
under the direction of the President, notified
Congress that the Department of Justice—
(1) would not defend the constitutionality
of the requirement to maintain minimum es-
sential coverage under section 5000A of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as added by
the ACA; and
(2) would argue that certain provisions of
the ACA, including the provisions protecting
an estimated 133,000,000 individuals in the
United States with pre-existing medical con-
ditions, are inseverable from the require-
ment to maintain minimum essential cov-
erage;
Whereas the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Texas—
(1) issued an order declaring that—
(A) the requirement to maintain minimum
essential coverage is unconstitutional; and
(B) the remaining provisions of the ACA,
including protections for individuals with
pre-existing medical conditions, are
inseverable from that requirement; and
(2) invalidated the remaining provisions of
the ACA;
Whereas the decision of the United States
District Court for the Northern District of
Texas was stayed and is pending appeal be-
fore the United States Court of Appeals for
the Fifth Circuit;
Whereas the refusal of the Department of
Justice to defend the ACA, as even then At-
torney General Sessions acknowledged in his
notice to Congress, contravened the Execu-
tive Branch’s ‘‘longstanding tradition of de-
fending the constitutionality of duly enacted
statutes if reasonable arguments can be
made in their defense’’;
Whereas reasonable arguments can be
made in defense of the ACA, as evidenced by
an amicus brief filed by legal experts, includ-
ing experts who supported other legal chal-
lenges to the ACA; and
Whereas, by arguing that the guaranteed
issue, community rating, and other protec-
tions prohibiting discrimination are
inseverable from the remaining provisions of
the ACA and therefore the remaining provi-
sions of the ACA are invalid, the Department
of Justice is risking vital protections for the
estimated 133,000,000 individuals in the
United States with pre-existing medical con-
ditions: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate
that the Department of Justice should pro-
tect individuals with pre-existing medical
conditions, including by reversing its posi-
tion and defending the critically important
provisions of the Patient Protection and Af-
fordable Care Act (Public Law 111–148; 124
Stat. 119) in Texas v. United States, No. 4:18–
cv–00167–O (N.D. Tex.).

resolution; which was referred to the
Committee on Foreign Relations:
S. RES. 95
Whereas the people of ancient Greece de-
veloped the concept of democracy, in which
the supreme power to govern was vested in
the people;
Whereas the founding fathers of the United
States, many of whom read Greek political
philosophy in the original Greek language,
drew heavily on the political experience and
philosophy of ancient Greece in forming the
representative democracy of the United
States;
Whereas Petros Mavromichalis, the former
Commander in Chief of Greece and a founder
of the modern Greek state, said to the citi-
zens of the United States in 1821, ‘‘It is in
your land that liberty has fixed her abode
and . . . in imitating you, we shall imitate
our ancestors and be thought worthy of them
if we succeed in resembling you.’’;
Whereas the Greek national anthem, the
‘‘Hymn to Liberty’’, includes the words,
‘‘most heartily was gladdened George Wash-
ington’s brave land’’;
Whereas the people of the United States
generously offered humanitarian assistance
to the people of Greece during their struggle
for independence;
Whereas Greece heroically resisted Axis
forces at a crucial moment in World War II,
forcing Adolf Hitler to change his timeline
and delaying the attack on Russia;
Whereas Winston Churchill said that ‘‘if
there had not been the virtue and courage of
the Greeks, we do not know which the out-
come of World War II would have been’’ and
‘‘no longer will we say that Greeks fight like
heroes, but that heroes fight like Greeks’’;
Whereas hundreds of thousands of the peo-
ple of Greece were killed during World War
II;
Whereas Greece consistently allied with
the United States in major international
conflicts throughout its history as a modern
state;
Whereas Greece is a strategic partner and
ally of the United States in bringing polit-
ical stability and economic development to
the Balkan region, having invested billions
of dollars in the countries of the region and
having contributed more than $750,000,000 in
development aid for the region;
Whereas the Government and people of
Greece actively participate in peacekeeping
and peace-building operations conducted by
international organizations, including the
United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, the European Union, and the
Organization for Security and Co-operation
in Europe;
Whereas Secretary of State Michael
Pompeo hosted Acting Greek Foreign Min-
ister George Katrougalos in a United States-
Greece Strategic Dialogue on December 13,
2018, that underscored Greece’s importance
to the United States as a pillar of stability
in the Eastern Mediterranean and Balkans
and as an important NATO ally;
Whereas the eastern Mediterranean tri-
lateral partnership of Greece, Israel, and Cy-
prus is increasingly important to United
States interests, and each country’s strong
relationship with the United States, as well
as the prospect of an Eastern Mediterranean
pipeline enabling safe transmission of gas to
Western Europe, is critical to security and
energy stability;
Whereas the United States was the hon-
ored country at Greece’s premier
Thessaloniki International Fair on Sep-
tember 8-16, 2018;
Whereas Greece received worldwide praise
for its extraordinary handling during the
2004 Olympic Games of more than 14,000 ath-
letes and more than 2,000,000 spectators and
journalists, a feat the Government and peo-
ple of Greece handled efficiently, securely,
and with hospitality;
Whereas Greece, located in a region where
Christianity meets Islam and Judaism,
maintains excellent relations with Muslim
countries and Israel;
Whereas Greece remains an integral part of
the European Union;
Whereas the Government of Greece has
taken important steps in recent years to fur-
ther cross-cultural understanding, rap-
prochement, and cooperation in various
fields with Turkey, and has also improved its
relations with other countries in the region,
including Israel, thus enhancing the sta-
bility of the wider region;
Whereas the Governments and people of
Greece and the United States are at the fore-
front of efforts to advance freedom, democ-
racy, peace, stability, and human rights;
Whereas those efforts and similar ideals
have forged a close bond between the people
of Greece and the United States; and
Whereas it is proper and desirable for the
United States to celebrate March 25, 2019,
Greek Independence Day, with the people of
Greece and to reaffirm the democratic prin-
ciples from which those two great countries
were founded: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) extends warm congratulations and best
wishes to the people of Greece as they cele-
brate the 198th anniversary of the independ-
ence of Greece;
(2) expresses support for the principles of
democratic governance to which the people
of Greece are committed; and
(3) notes the important role that Greece
has played in the wider European region and
in the community of nations since gaining
its independence 198 years ago.

OPIOID EPIDEMIC
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I
have come to the floor of the Senate
today to talk about the opioid crisis, to
talk about what is happening out there
in our communities and how some of
our Federal legislation is working, and
to talk about some good news, which is
that there is some improvement in
terms of the overdose deaths we have
seen in this country, but also a warn-
ing that although we are finally mak-
ing progress on the opioid crisis, we are
also seeing other drugs, such as pure
crystal meth, coming from Mexico and
other drugs beginning to take hold in
our communities.
So let me start, if I could, by talking
a little about what the opioid crisis has
been and what we are doing to address
it.
You recall that the last data we had,
which is for 2017—over 70,000 Americans
lost their lives to overdoses. The No. 1
drug, the No. 1 killer, has been
fentanyl, which is a synthetic opioid
that, about 4 or 5 years ago, hit our
communities hard. Year after year, for
7 or 8 years now, we have seen in-
creases every single year in the number
of people who die from overdoses,
which is one way to measure it. An-
other way to measure it is just the
number of people addicted. That is a
harder figure to find, but that has also
increased year to year.
It is devastating communities. The
No. 1 cause of death in my home State
of Ohio is opioid overdoses. Among
Americans under 50, it is now the No. 1
cause of death in America.
It also has had many impacts on our
health system and on our criminal jus-
tice system. Go to the emergency
rooms. Look at our jails that are filled
with people whose crimes somehow re-
late to opioids. Often, these are prop-
erty crimes—people doing something to
get the money to pay for their drugs.
Look at the impact it has had on our
families. The foster care system is
overwhelmed. I was with some juvenile
court judges today from Ohio who were
telling me that they can’t find spon-
sors, that they can’t find foster parents
because the system is overrun with
kids whose parents are addicted to
opioids, and they cannot go home, but
they need a loving family.
It has impacted our economy because
so many people are now out of work al-
together, aren’t even looking for work,
and don’t even show up in the unem-
ployment numbers. If you look at the
labor force participation rate being so
low—in other words, the number of
people working—the unemployment
rate today would not be 4 percent; it
would be more like 8 percent if you just
went back to a normal level. And a lot
of that, based on studies done by the
Department of Labor and Brookings
and others, shows that the opioid crisis
is driving that.
It has impacted us in so many ways.
Here is the exciting news: After 7 or
8 years of increases every year in the
number of people whose hopes are lost,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1664 March 5, 2019
whose lives are lost, we are seeing—at
the end of 2017 and into 2018, the initial
numbers we have—some improvement.
It starts from an unacceptably high
number, so this is not something we
should start congratulating ourselves
about, but it is much better, finally, to
see this trend start to reverse.
Preliminary data from the Centers
for Disease Control and their National
Center for Health Statistics points to a
promising, although very modest,
downturn. They measure drug overdose
deaths in 12-month periods, ending in
any given month. The last data we
have regarding predicted deaths was
between September 2017 and March
2018, and during that time period, we
saw the number of deaths fall from
about 73,000 Americans to 71,000 Ameri-
cans.
So there is still a crisis that we face
as a country, but it shows that in many
States, including Ohio, we are begin-
ning to see a little progress. Again,
this follows a time period where we saw
a big increase due to this fentanyl—the
synthetic drug that is 50 times more
powerful than heroin—causing so many
of those overdoses.
In fact, in my view, we were begin-
ning to make progress through some
Federal, State, and local policies and
also the innovative work of the non-
profits that were working in our com-
munities. We had begun to see progress
on treatment and prevention and re-
covery and providing more Narcan, and
then this influx of fentanyl hit us and
overwhelmed the system. Now we are
beginning to see—even with the
fentanyl still out there—that we are
beginning to make progress.
In Ohio—fentanyl hit our State par-
ticularly hard. We had a record 4,800
overdose deaths in 2017, which was a 20-
percent jump over 2016’s toll. So it has
been tough for 8 years in a row.
What I can report today is that now
we are seeing a little progress. We saw
a 21-percent drop in overdose deaths in
the first half of 2018. Again, we have
not yet gotten all the numbers for 2018.
When we have all those, I will come
back to the floor and talk about them.
But for the first half of 2018, we are
getting the numbers in now at about a
20-percent drop.
That was the biggest drop in the Na-
tion, by the way, during the period
from July 2017 through June 2018, ac-
cording to the Centers for Disease Con-
trol. So that is good, because Ohio has
been in the middle of this. Other than
West Virginia, we probably have had
the highest number of overdose deaths
on average in the last several years.
Separately, preliminary data from
the Ohio Department of Health shows a
34-percent decrease in overdose deaths
from January to June 2018. Again,
those first 6 months, we saw a little de-
crease, finally—34 percent. That is
progress—again, from a high starting
point, but I believe we are headed in
the right direction.
Some people have asked me ‘‘Are we
ever going to see the end of this cri-
sis?’’ and I have always said yes. There
is a light at the end of the tunnel be-
cause we know what we need to do.
We need to have better education and
prevention programs to keep people
from falling into addiction in the first
place. We need to stop the overpre-
scribing from our doctors so that peo-
ple aren’t inadvertently, because of an
accident or an injury, taking prescrip-
tion pain pills and then becoming ad-
dicted and then moving to heroin and
fentanyl and so on and often to
overdoses.
We need to do much more in terms of
treatment and getting people into
longer term recovery because we know
initial treatment is important. In fact,
essential to getting people through the
process of coming out of their addic-
tion is that they have to go through a
painful process and then go into a
treatment program. We have also found
that longer term recovery programs
are key to people’s success—getting
back on their feet, getting back to
their families, and getting back to
work.
One of the reasons we have made
progress is because, as I said earlier, at
every level of government, there has
been movement, and there has been
progress made. Here in Washington, in
the Congress, we have done things that
are historic. As an example, never be-
fore have we funded recovery—until
just a few years ago. We have never had
this much focus on providing the funds
for Narcan to be used to help our first
responders and others use this miracle
drug to reverse the effects of an over-
dose. We have never spent so much
money on prevention and education.
And, of course, we have never spent so
much money on treatment.
Several years ago, some of us came
together, knowing this crisis was build-
ing, and said: How do we create legisla-
tion here in Washington that can make
a difference? Some said it is not really
a Federal role. My view was that the
Federal Government has a big role here
because it is a national emergency, a
national crisis, but we ought to take
the best information from around the
country, find out what the best prac-
tices are, and then help the States by
providing funding to leverage addi-
tional funding at the local level, the
State level. That was called the Com-
prehensive Addiction and Recovery
Act. We spent 3 or 4 years putting it to-
gether. We had five conferences here in
Washington. Senator WHITEHOUSE on
the other side of the aisle and I are the
coauthors of that legislation.
The first year, we got some money
from Congress—$181 million—to sup-
port these treatment programs, edu-
cation programs, treatment and recov-
ery programs together, Narcan for our
first responders—181 million bucks.
The next fiscal year, we got $267 mil-
lion to fund these same programs. The
next year, 2018, we got $608 million. In
2019, this year, we got $647 million. So
we have increased the funding and in-
creased the commitment. Why? Be-
cause it is working. Because we can all
go home now and look at our States
and see where some of this funding is
going and show that through innova-
tion, through doing things differently,
we are beginning to make a difference.
Let me give the best example, per-
haps, that I see around the country;
that is, instead of saving someone’s life
with Narcan and having that person
overdose sometimes again and again—
first responders will tell you that they
find it frustrating to save the same
people again and again and not find
any route to success. You want to get
these people into treatment. So what
we have funded through CARA—the
Comprehensive Addiction and Recov-
ery Act—are these rapid-response
teams. So when somebody overdoses
from fentanyl, they don’t just go back
home or go back to the old community
or the old gang. Instead, somebody vis-
its—a law enforcement officer, a social
worker, a treatment provider. They
knock on the door and say: We want to
get you into treatment. We want to
help you. We are here to help. We are
not here to arrest you; we are here to
help you.
The success rate is phenomenal—
maybe greater than you would think—
because a lot of these people, particu-
larly right after overdosing and having
Narcan applied, saw their lives flash
before their eyes, and they are looking
for some help. Probably 8 out of 10 peo-
ple are not getting into treatment, so
they are looking for an avenue to
treatment.
In some places in Ohio, there has
been as much as an 80-percent success
rate in getting those people who were
virtually a zero-percent success rate
before into treatment programs. Again,
they have to be the right programs,
and there has to be that longer term
recovery in order to ensure success, but
programs like those are beginning to
turn the tide.
Over the past several months, I have
been around the State of Ohio—as I
have done the last several years—and I
met with local leaders to find out what
is really going on and how the money
is being spent.
A couple of weeks ago, I met local
leaders and participants in the Path-
ways Achieving Recovery by Choice
program. That is a voluntary recovery
program for incarcerated women with
substance abuse disorders and many
with co-occurring mental health issues
as well. These are women behind bars
who volunteer to go into this program.
All of them are numerous repeat of-
fenders. In other words, these are
women whose chances of being back in
the system after they get out is ex-
tremely high. The program director
said it is virtually 100 percent because
they have been arrested numerous
times, and they keep coming back
again and again into the system.
This program that I got to see re-
ceived a grant from the Comprehensive
Addiction and Recovery Act of $881,000
so that this program could last not just

1 year but several years. They put it in
place. They are providing treatment
and recovery services for these women
and teaching them not just about how
to avoid going back to the old neigh-
borhood and getting back in trouble
again but also how to establish their
lives in a productive way—going back
to work, getting back with their fami-
lies.
It was great to hear from Dr. Patrice
Palmer, who runs the program, and
also Franklin County Commissioner
Marilyn Brown, Sheriff Dallas Baldwin,
and others about how this is helping
residents get what they need—the
treatment and recovery services they
need, the housing they need—but most
importantly, get them to rebuild their
lives and not come back into the sys-
tem. I mentioned earlier that the re-
cidivism rate is virtually 100 percent
for this group. In other words, 100 per-
cent of them are going to come back
into prison based on the record. This
program has got that down to 20 per-
cent. In other words, 80 percent of
these women have gotten out, gotten
into the programs they need, gotten
back on their feet, gotten a job, and
found an apartment. Eighty percent of
them are back in our communities as
productive citizens. That, to me, is
what this is all about.
I spoke to a number of the partici-
pants in the program, and they were
optimistic because it is a very upbeat
program. I was asked to give a quote,
and I gave a Winston Churchill quote
about how when you fall down, the
most important thing is getting back
up. That is more important than suc-
cess without having failures. I talked
about the fact that I have been to a lot
of these programs around the State,
and I have seen where people find—for
the first time in their lives, in many
cases—the kind of meaning in their
lives and the kind of hope for the fu-
ture that let them get back on track.
I talked to Nina Davidson. She is a
repeat offender. Nina said what all the
women said. She said: I don’t want to
go back to jail. She doesn’t want to
keep living that life. She has been in
and out of jail many times. Pathways
has helped her change her thinking,
and that is what it is all about—chang-
ing the thinking and therefore chang-
ing lives and saving lives.
Earlier this year, I met with law en-
forcement, local officials, and members
of the Hamilton County Heroin Coali-
tion to find out how they are using
these Federal funds.
Again, I am here talking to my col-
leagues, Republican and Democrat
alike, saying that we need more
money, and they want to know where
it is going. Is it working?
Well, I just talked about one that is
working in Columbus. It is also work-
ing in Hamilton County, which is the
Cincinnati Federal area. They have re-
ceived Federal funding through the
CARA legislation and also the 21st Cen-
tury Cures law—again, something this
Congress passed on a bipartisan basis.
The county has received a $500,000
CARA grant for an innovative program
to help those with substance abuse and
mental health disorders get help in-
stead of going through the criminal
justice system. They also got $50,000
for a prevention grant for a group
called PreventionFirst!, which is a
group I founded more than 20 years
ago, about 25 years ago in Cincinnati.
It is still there helping to prevent drug
abuse. They are doing a good job. They
have also received money through the
21st Century Cures Act. In fact, in the
last 2 years, Ohio has received 26 mil-
lion bucks a year from the Cures legis-
lation that goes straight to the State,
and the State decides how it is given
out to good groups and organizations
around the State.
The Cures funding and the CARA
funding, as I see it, is working. It is ex-
panding Medicaid-assisted treatment.
It is helping first responders—these are
our EMS, our firefighters—who are out
there trying to save lives. They need
the training on Narcan. They need the
funding.
It has also helped with regard to clos-
ing the gap for those who are seeking
treatment. I mentioned earlier the gap
between Narcan being applied and
somebody getting into treatment.
There is also a gap, unfortunately, be-
tween people in treatment and getting
into longer term recovery. Often, there
is a waiting period there, and people
fall back into their addiction. These
gaps can be closed, and when they are
and when it is a comprehensive, seam-
less program, the results are amazing.
During our meeting in Hamilton
County, Newtown, OH, Police Chief
Tom Synan told me that fentanyl con-
tinues to be the deadliest drug in
greater Cincinnati. He wants us to im-
plement quickly two pieces of legisla-
tion. One is called the STOP Act,
which this Congress passed to keep
fentanyl from flowing freely into our
communities.
In August 2016, we had 174 overdoses
in 6 days—174 in 6 days. It was what
they called a bad batch. It was fentanyl
being mixed with heroin. That drew na-
tional attention to the crisis. That is
when we started working on this STOP
Act, which is to say, let’s stop this
stuff from coming in through the U.S.
mail system, which is where most of it
comes, and from China, which is where
most of it comes. We passed that legis-
lation, and it is helping because it re-
quires the U.S. Postal Service to actu-
ally screen through these packages to
get the information to know what is a
suspect package to help Customs and
Border Protection pull these packages
off and begin to pull some of these
drugs out of our communities, which,
at a minimum, increases the cost of
this drug on the street, which is impor-
tant.
We also have the other legislation. I
see that my colleague SHERROD BROWN
is on the floor today. The INTERDICT
Act helps because it gives those same
people more funding for the screening
they need once they have identified a
package that is suspect. That combina-
tion is making a difference right now.
President Trump signed that law in Oc-
tober of last year after about 2 years of
hard work and investigation by the
Permanent Subcommittee on Inves-
tigations. It is making a difference,
but, as Police Chief Tom Synan said,
we have to implement it and imple-
ment it quickly.
I spoke today to the Secretary of
Homeland Security. She talked about
the INTERDICT Act. She wants to
push those quickly, and we need to, be-
cause those will continue to make a
difference. But they are starting to
work, and that is part of the reason we
are seeing some progress.
I recently toured the jail in Butler
County, OH, to see firsthand how they
are using their Federal funding. They
got about $800,000 in a CARA grant. I
met with Scott Rasmus, the executive
director of the Butler County Mental
Health and Addiction Recovery Serv-
ices Board, Sheriff Jones, and other
community leaders about how they are
using this funding to close the gaps
that often occur with treatment.
Again, they are doing what I talked
about earlier, with these rapid response
teams that ensure, that, yes, they are
saving people’s lives with Narcan, but
then getting them into a treatment
program that works for them.
In January I was in Portsmouth, OH,
one of the hardest hit areas of our
State. Portsmouth, OH, has been the
subject of a lot of attention by the
media—a lot of attention because they
were hit so hard by the heroin crisis
that followed the prescription drug cri-
sis.
I met there with law enforcement
and local officials from Adams County,
Lawrence County, and Scioto County.
They have received $525,000 in grants
from the Cures Act, and they are using
it to help to address every aspect of ad-
diction, including the gaps in treat-
ment I talked about. They funded a re-
entry project, the Hughes Re-Entry
Center, which provides longer term as-
sistance through outpatient services,
assisted housing, and working with the
Community Justice Center to close the
gaps occurring when people get out of
prison and getting them into programs
that will help them to avoid getting
right back into prison again.
Lastly, I want to highlight a recent
visit I made to the Oasis House. Oasis
is a safe house in Dayton, OH. It pro-
vides a supportive environment and re-
covery services to women who were
trafficked or abused, and it helps them
get back on their feet through coun-
seling, drug treatment, or other social
services. I was there last month and
had the opportunity to visit with the
women. It is a Christian, nonprofit or-
ganization—a faith-based group—that
runs these safe houses. Most of these
women are victims of human traf-
ficking. These women are often home-
less. Every single one of them I talked
to was also an addict or a recovering

addict. They have been through a lot—
a lot of trauma—and they need the
help, but the good news is they are get-
ting the help, and there is hope.
At my visit to the safe house, I met
these incredibly courageous women
who have taken these steps voluntarily
to get their lives back together, using
faith and using, in some cases, treat-
ment programs. The funding they are
getting is coming through the Mont-
gomery County ADAMHS Board, the
alcohol and drug board, and that fund-
ing comes from the CARA legislation
and the Cures legislation. Again, seeing
in action what is actually happening
on the ground gives me hope that we
are beginning to make progress.
I met with the safe house ‘‘Mom.’’
She is the resident mother, as she calls
herself, of this house. She is there to
take care of concerns that women
have. She is a recovering addict her-
self. She is a domestic violence sur-
vivor. Oasis House saved her life, and
now she is giving back by helping cur-
rent Oasis clients to be able to help
save their lives. I want to congratulate
Cheryl Oliver, their executive director,
for all of the great work they are
doing. The bravery of these young
women was inspiring and, again, it is
great to see firsthand how this is mak-
ing a difference in their lives.
We have recently seen this issue of
trafficking arise in connection with a
sex trafficking ring in Florida. We are
told that illicit spas—like those in
Florida that you have probably heard
about in the media in the last week or
so—can sometimes be hubs of human
trafficking, where women, often im-
ported from foreign countries, are
brought in to America. They are often
induced through fraud, fear, or some
other type of coercion to perform sex
acts for money, and that is what inves-
tigators believe happened here. They
believe that the women in these spas
were from foreign countries, and that
they were induced into this through co-
ercion. There is more information com-
ing out. They don’t have all of the de-
tails yet. The investigation continues,
but they suspect the managers at these
day spas were trafficking these women,
and, therefore, they arrested the own-
ers at several of these day spas. It is
another disturbing reminder that
human trafficking continues to exist
right here in this country in this cen-
tury, and we must stay vigilant in our
efforts to combat this horrific crime.
In my last 8 years here in the Senate,
it has been one of our top priorities to
pass legislation to combat human traf-
ficking. We have passed bills into law
to get better data on sex trafficking
here in the United States, to ensure
that victims are treated as victims and
not as criminals, to increase Federal
penalties on johns, and to enact a zero-
tolerance policy on human trafficking
and government contracts.
I am proud to say that, with Senator
BLUMENTHAL, we cofounded and co-
chaired the human trafficking caucus
here. We started off with a couple
Members, and now we have a couple
dozen Members of this body who work
day in and day out to say: How can we
do more to help?
One thing we found through our re-
search was that online sex trafficking
is growing dramatically and is one rea-
son you see the increase in sex traf-
ficking here in this country and around
the world.
After 18 months of investigation—
particularly into backpage, which was
the commercial site that had probably
three-quarters of the trafficking on it—
we passed a law called the SESTA leg-
islation, which ensures that these
websites that knowingly engage, facili-
tate, or promote trafficking are held
accountable for what happens on their
platforms. It is about time. We should
have done it a long time ago.
Having passed that legislation,
backpage is now shut down, and the
National Center for Missing and Ex-
ploited Children reported to us that
probably about two-thirds of these on-
line websites that sell women and chil-
dren online have now been discon-
tinued. Again, we haven’t solved the
problem. It is still very much out
there. Other websites will crop up on
the dark web as well, but we have made
progress by focusing on the issue in a
bipartisan way. Numerous websites
have been shut down, as we have been
told by the experts. I will quote the Na-
tional Center for Missing and Exploited
Children: ‘‘Since the enactment of
SESTA and the government’s seizure of
Backpage, there has been a major dis-
ruption in the online marketplace.’’
As we talked earlier—whether it is
the SESTA legislation that is now
working, whether it is the CARA legis-
lation and the Cures legislation on the
opioid crisis—that we are making a dif-
ference. The funding that has been pro-
vided by this body and by the House—
after careful research to figure out
what works and what doesn’t work and
sending it to evidence-based pro-
grams—is working. We cannot take our
eye off the ball. We cannot stop now. If
we do, we will just see this problem
crop up in different ways.
I mentioned that as we are making
progress on opioids, law enforcement
and those who are in the trenches—
treatment providers—are talking about
the fact that other drugs are beginning
to rise, particularly crystal meth. So
we can’t stop. We have to continue.
These programs are making a dif-
ference, helping people to get their
lives back on track and helping to save
their lives. The Federal Government
continues to have a role here to be bet-
ter partners in this effort with States,
local governments, and nonprofits that
are out there doing their best and, ulti-
mately, with our families. That is what
this is all about, giving people hope
and saving lives.
I yield back my time.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio.
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I
thank my friend from Cincinnati for
his work on both the issues he spoke
about—both, on sex trafficking, which
is a terrible affliction in our country
and especially in Ohio, and on the issue
of opioid deaths. We lose almost 100
people a week in Ohio to overdoses, and
more than 11 a day on opioid overdoses.
So I thank my colleague from Cin-
cinnati for that.

GM CLOSURES
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, this
week, General Motors is set to lay off
thousands of workers in Lordstown,
OH, and around the country. Tomorrow
is the day that most of the first shift
lose their jobs. Several months ago, the
second shift lost their jobs. A couple
years ago, the third shift lost their
jobs. That totals about 4,500 human
beings with families.
What is the President’s response? He
boasts nonsense and rubs salt in these
workers’ wounds. Last week, as if he
didn’t know about Lordstown and other
places, he said: We have car companies
opening up in Michigan and Ohio and
Pennsylvania and so many other
places.
I don’t know where those mystery
factories are in Ohio that the President
brags about. They aren’t in Lordstown,
where people are about to lose those
jobs. President Trump’s remarks, his
uncaring feelings, and his ignorance of
even knowing what has happened in
Ohio—the State he seems to boast
about and credit for his victory—are a
slap in the face to the workers, and
there is the fact that he has done noth-
ing to help.
Think about the workers who are out
of a job at the end of the week. Think
about their families. Think about the
other families in Lordstown who are
about to lose customers.
Senator PORTMAN and I spent a lot of
time working with General Motors, vis-
iting a restaurant near the plant and
talking to the workers there who know
their jobs are affected as fewer
Lordstown workers come to that res-
taurant. Multiply that with hardware
stores, police and fire jobs and teacher
jobs and all that afflicts the Mahoning
Valley when GM does what it does.
Remember what Donald Trump
promised people in communities like
Youngstown. He said that he would
fight for them, that he would fight for
their jobs. Last year, he told the people
of Mahoning Valley—Mahoning Valley
is Youngstown, Warren, Lordstown,
and that area: ‘‘Don’t move.’’
These are the President’s words:
Don’t move, don’t sell your house. We’re
going to fill up those factories or rip them
down and build new ones.
He said:
We never again will sacrifice Ohio jobs and
those in other states to enrich other coun-
tries.
Think about that. The President of
the United States comes in, in the
midst of these GM layoffs, and says:
Don’t sell your house. Don’t move. We
are going to fill those factories up. If

we don’t fill them up, we are going to
rip them down and build new ones.
He went on to say: Workers will come
back. Jobs will come back from these
countries.
Then, even when I called and talked
to him about the second-shift layoff, he
didn’t even know about it. I am not
sure what his staff is telling him.
Maybe FOX doesn’t cover these stories,
but the mainstream media does. These
are real stories. These aren’t political
opinions. Some 4,500 people lost their
jobs, and the President doesn’t seem to
know or care.
Those weren’t the only promises he
made. Over and over, Candidate Trump
and then-President Trump promised
American autoworkers that he would
fight for their jobs.
In Warren, just a few miles from
Lordstown, in 2016, he said: ‘‘If I’m
elected, you won’t lose one plant, I
promise you that.’’ ‘‘If I’m elected, you
won’t lose one plant, I promise you
that.’’
In Michigan in the fall of 2016—an-
other State with a lot of auto jobs—he
said: ‘‘We will bring back your auto
manufacturing business like you have
never seen it before.’’
In February 2017, he promised again:
‘‘A lot of jobs are going to be coming
back into Ohio and Michigan and Penn-
sylvania and all the places that have
been hurt so badly.’’
In March 2017, he said: ‘‘The assault
on the American auto industry, believe
me, is over.’’
Last year, after GM announced the
layoffs, he said: ‘‘Ohio is going to re-
place those jobs like in two minutes.’’
‘‘Ohio is going to replace those jobs
like in two minutes.’’
First of all, why would he say this
stuff? Second, does he not ever follow
the news? Does his staff not tell him
what has happened in the seventh larg-
est State in the country and the State
that he in part credits for his election?
He lost the popular vote by 3 million
votes. He won the electoral college be-
cause of Ohio and because of two or
three other States. But wouldn’t he
know that a valley of 450,000 people,
just during the time since the election,
has lost 4,500 jobs just in that plant
alone, and another 5,000 manufacturing
jobs that make the components that go
into the Chevy Cruze, and another 5,000
to 6,000 to 8,000 to 10,000 jobs? Nobody
knows for sure how many they will lose
in restaurants, hardware stores, and
car dealerships and cuts in public dol-
lars because the local governments
have lost tax revenue so there are
fewer police and fire and street clean-
ers and people who work in the cities,
the counties, and the school districts.
The workers who are going to be out
of a job by this week are still waiting.
These people trusted him. President
Trump did really well in the election in
this valley of 450,000 people. He did
really well.
He did really well. He did better than
Republicans ever do, but what did he
do for them after he made those prom-
ises? I am going to make a statement
that is provably true but almost
doesn’t even make sense that it could
be true. His tax bill says: If you do
your production in Lordstown, OH, you
pay a 21-percent tax rate, but if you
move your production to Mexico, you
pay a 10.5-percent tax rate.
In other words, because of Trump’s
tax law that, frankly, was written
down the hall in Senator MCCONNELL’s
office but with the President’s signa-
ture on it, these companies get a 50-
percent-off coupon for moving over-
seas. Think about that. If these compa-
nies move overseas, they get a 50-per-
cent-off coupon on their taxes.
I talked to the President about that.
I asked him to reconsider that law, and
he said: ‘‘Where did that law come
from?’’
I said: ‘‘Well, Mr. President, it was in
your tax bill, and you signed it.’’
Then I talked to him about the
American Cars, American Jobs Act and
how he can fix this. Here is what the
bill does. Customers who buy cars
made in the United States get a $3,500
discount at the dealership. If the Amer-
ican car is electric or a plug-in hybrid,
they get an even bigger discount. These
are the cars GM said it was going to
start making instead of the Cruze.
There is no reason they can’t make
them in Lordstown instead of Mexico.
Second, companies that cut the num-
ber of American jobs they had on the
day the GOP tax bill passed, if they
move those jobs overseas, they lose
their tax breaks. Under my bill, the
American Cars, American Jobs Act,
they lose their tax breaks, they lose
that 50-percent-off coupon, and then
that money they have to pay because
they lose their tax break goes to car
consumers at the dealerships, meaning
they will buy more American cars. So
what will happen is it will actually do
what Candidate Trump said he wanted
to do and promised that he would do,
and that is to bring American jobs
back.
This President who says: ‘‘I am the
workers’ best friend, and I fight for
these jobs,’’ that is phony populism. Do
you know something? Populism is
never racist. Populism is never anti-
Semitic. Populism doesn’t divide peo-
ple. Populism doesn’t push people down
to lift people up. Populism doesn’t give
tax cuts to rich people and then turn
around and cut Medicare and Head
Start. Populism fights for people and
fights to lift up all workers. That is
what we are not seeing here now.
I am calling on the President, again,
to try keeping his promises and actu-
ally fight for autoworkers, fight for
these communities like Lordstown, and
help us pass the Americans Cars, Amer-
ican Jobs Act, end the tax cut for cor-
porations to shut down American
plants and move jobs overseas, and
take this 50-percent-off coupon away
that some of the richest people and big-
gest corporations in this country enjoy
when they send jobs overseas because if
you love your country, you fight for
the people who make it work.
NOMINATIONS
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, the
last vote we took today was about
Americans’ healthcare. It was about
consumer protections for preexisting
conditions that are at risk because of
partisan judges.
The Presiding Officer was running for
the Senate at the time and wasn’t in
this body, but I assume she knows, and
all of us remember the day when the
repeal of the Affordable Care Act
failed.
The people on that side of the aisle,
the Republicans, were all voting to
take away consumer protections for
preexisting conditions. That was part
of the vote for the repeal. Among other
things, it was to cut people off Med-
icaid, many of whom were getting
treatment for opioid addiction, and it
was to take away the consumer protec-
tions for preexisting conditions. That
is when people can’t get insurance be-
cause they are sick or they get their
insurance canceled because they are
too expensive. They are sick, their in-
surance is too expensive, and the insur-
ance companies come down on them.
So the stage was set. The Republican
Members who said they wanted to pre-
serve preexisting conditions, many of
them ran their campaigns on—because
they knew the voters were very upset
with Republicans for trying to take
away the consumer protections on pre-
existing conditions, they ran their
campaigns on that issue. So the Repub-
licans quickly flipped and said: Well,
we are going to protect you too.
Well, tomorrow is the day we have a
chance to really protect the consumers
with preexisting conditions and to keep
the protections for consumers with pre-
existing conditions. The problem is,
they can’t do it in Congress. They can’t
take it away because voters don’t like
it if they take away the protections so
they do it through the Federal judici-
ary. That is how they work around
here.
These partisan judges who are voted
out of here—maybe the worst one yet
is from Columbus, OH, named Chad
Readler. Last summer, Readler did
what three career attorneys with the
Department of Justice refused to do—
he filed a brief challenging the law pro-
tecting Americans with preexisting
conditions.
He was the person in the Trump ad-
ministration who was the point person
for taking away the consumer protec-
tions protecting Americans against los-
ing their insurance because of a pre-
existing condition.
Do you know what? After he filed
that brief, the very next day the lights
went on. The very next day, Chad
Readler was nominated for a lifetime
appointment to the Sixth Circuit
Court—the next day.
He did his work for the insurance
companies. He did his work for the
Trump White House. He did his work
for the Republican majority who is
going to take away any consumer pro-
tections. What is his reward? I guess

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1668 March 5, 2019
you can’t say ‘‘payoff’’ because there
were no dollars actually exchanged,
but the reward that this party—the
Senate majority leader down the hall
and the President of the United
States—gave the guy who wants to
take those protections away and do the
bidding of the insurance company is a
lifetime—I don’t know, $180,000,
$200,000-a-year, whatever it is—Federal
judgeship. It is for life. Mr. Readler is
in his forties, so lifetime could be a
very long time.
The arguments he made were unprec-
edented. Three career attorneys with-
drew from the case after Readler made
that decision. One went so far as to re-
sign in objection to the Department of
Justice’s unprecedented actions.
Our Republican colleague Senator
ALEXANDER from Tennessee called Re-
adler’s arguments as farfetched as he
had ever seen. This is a Republican
saying that the Trump White House’s
Department of Justice Chad Readler’s,
Acting Assistant Attorney General,
logic was as farfetched as he had ever
seen.
We saw what happened with the
Texas decision in December, going
along with Readler’s arguments and
threatening the healthcare coverage of
20 million Americans; that is, 20 mil-
lion people because of a decision he
made.
Judges are deciding the fate of Amer-
icans’ healthcare right now. Judges
are. It is not their elected body. It is
judges who are taking away
healthcare. The elected officials failed
to take it away. They tried. They tried,
and they tried. They did it 50 times in
the House. They tried in the Senate.
We defeated it by one vote. The Vice
President was here on behalf of the
President just in case he had to break
the tie. He didn’t have to because we
defeated it by one vote. He didn’t get
to break the tie.
Now it is judges. Judges decide right
now. We can’t afford to put one of the
White House’s ringleaders in the fight
to dismantle healthcare protections on
the bench for life.
It is not just healthcare. It is LGBTQ
rights. It is women’s rights. It is voting
rights. Judges make decisions right
now that eliminate and limit Ameri-
cans’ rights for a generation.
On these issues, the President’s
nominees for the Sixth Circuit, Chad
Readler and the other one, Eric Mur-
phy, have a proven record of fighting to
strip Americans of their rights.
Get this. Chad Readler not only sup-
ported the death penalty for minors,
for 16-year-olds, as a private citizen, he
took it upon himself to pen an op-ed
saying he wanted to allow the execu-
tion of 16-year-olds—the execution of
16-year-olds. Think about that.
Apparently, he thinks it is OK for a
mistake someone makes as a child to
not only get them locked up for life but
to actually take away their life alto-
gether. What kind of person writes an
editorial calling for the execution of
16-year-olds, and we are going to put
him on the Federal court for life?
At a time when we are taking impor-
tant bipartisan steps forward on sen-
tencing reform, how do you turn
around and put someone on the bench
for life who supports executing chil-
dren? A 16-year-old is still a teenager,
a child, in our State, in our country,
and in our society.
During his nomination hearing,
Readler stood by his op-ed. He refused
to disavow his support for using the
death penalty on high schoolers.
As for Eric Murphy, he argued
against marriage equality in the land-
mark Obergefell v. Hodges case. That is
why Jim Obergefell has spoken out
against his nomination.
He worked to restrict access to con-
traceptives for women, and my favor-
ite, he defended Big Tobacco because
those companies were doing such useful
things for our country. As a lawyer, he
defended Big Tobacco.
He also defended Ohio’s voter purge.
Think about the anniversary we will
mark this week. This Thursday will
mark 54 years, to the day, since Bloody
Sunday.
Last weekend, my wife Connie and I
were in Selma and walked across the
Selma bridge. For me, it was the fifth
time. I took my teenage daughters
once. I took my mother, who was born
in a small town in the South and
taught me about civil rights. My wife
and I went. We went back again this
year to walk across the Edmund Pettus
Bridge.
I listened to their stories. Women
and men were beaten, their blood was
spilled, and their homes were broken
into. Why? Because people of color
couldn’t vote in many places in this
country, and Alabama was one of those
places. They were willing to suffer and,
in some cases, die so they could have a
right to vote. That was only a half cen-
tury ago. That happened only 54 years
ago.
Judges around this country, all the
way to the Supreme Court, are system-
atically dismantling those rights.
Without question, they are taking
away people’s right to vote by voter
suppression. We can’t let the sacrifices
of the foot soldiers in Selma be in vain.
It is pretty despicable that a bunch
of Members of Congress who have
health insurance are willing to take it
away for millions of people. That is
pretty despicable. It is also despicable
that Members of this body are going to
mark this anniversary by putting an-
other judge on the bench for life who
will work to undo that legacy, who will
likely be another judge ruling to send
us back to those days, and who will
rubberstamp modern-day poll taxes and
literacy tests. They will not exactly do
poll taxes and literacy tests, but they
will find plenty of ways to take voters
off the rolls.
We know the Governor’s race in
Georgia was essentially stolen from the
African-American woman who was the
nominee because of the sitting Sec-
retary of State—oh, yes, who happened
to be running for Governor. We know
that. We know the election in Georgia
was stolen. We know voters were
purged prior to that election by the
Secretary of State, who happened to be
running for Governor.
I ask my colleagues, if you will not
listen to me, listen to those foot sol-
diers in Selma, listen to the civil rights
leaders who ask you to reject these
judges.
I yield the floor.

HONORING LEE ARTHUR HOWE III
HON. JOSEPH D. MORELLE
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor a constituent of the 25th dis-
trict, Lee Arthur Howe, III. Mr. Howe passed
away on January 8, just 2 months shy of his
87th birthday. Mr. Howe graduated with his
master’s in education from Fredonia State
Teacher’s College before spending two years
in the army during the Korean War. After an
honorable discharge, he moved to Rochester
in 1955 to begin his devotion to public edu-
cation. He began teaching 6th grade at Lin-
coln Avenue School, known today as Suther-
land High School. His promotion to principal
came in 1962, and he would serve in that role
at three other elementary schools until his re-
tirement in 1988.
The oldest son of a Baptist preacher, he
moved to different towns around Western New
York along with his mother and three brothers.
While he was young, he developed two life-
long loves: jazz, especially big band jazz, and
making those around him howl with laughter.
He learned the trumpet and played it at every
opportunity. He served as a first chair trumpet
for the Perinton Concert Band for many years,
entertaining countless big band concert fans
all around the Rochester region.
Mr. Howe was beloved by his family, and
whenever he went, music and laughter fol-
lowed him. He was a gentle man, who took
more pride in the accomplishments of his chil-
dren and grandchildren than he did in his own
accomplishments. Patient beyond words, a
trait that is vital to being as avid of a golfer as
he was in his retirement, he was able to enjoy
his life to the fullest.
While I am saddened by Mr. Howe’s pass-
ing, I am proud to have represented a man
who brought so much joy to so many people
for so many years. My heart is with his entire
extended family.

DESTANIE ALLEN
HON. ED PERLMUTTER
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Destanie Allen
for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service
Ambassadors for Youth award.
Destanie Allen is a student at Jefferson Jr/
Sr. and received this award because her de-
termination and hard work have allowed her to
overcome adversities.
The dedication demonstrated by Destanie
Allen is exemplary of the type of achievement
that can be attained with hard work and perse-
verance. It is essential students at all levels
strive to make the most of their education and
develop a work ethic which will guide them for
the rest of their lives.
I extend my deepest congratulations to
Destanie Allen for winning the Arvada Wheat
Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award.
I have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of her future ac-
complishments.

OATH CEREMONY ON MARCH 8, 2019
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with
great pleasure and sincerity that I take this
time to congratulate twenty-five individuals
who will take their oaths of citizenship on
March 8, 2019. This memorable occasion will
be held at the United States Courthouse and
Federal Building in Hammond, Indiana.
America is a country founded by immi-
grants. From its beginning, settlers have come
from countries around the world to the United
States in search of better lives for their fami-
lies. Oath ceremonies are a shining example
of what is so great about the United States of
America—that people from all over the world
can come together and unite as members of
a free, democratic nation. These individuals
realize that nowhere else in the world offers a
better opportunity for success than here in
America.
On March 8, 2019, the following people,
representing many nations throughout the
world, will take their oaths of citizenship in
Hammond, Indiana: Saudi Elizabeth Gonzalez-
Martinez, Clemence lngabire Andrew, Avelina
Garcia, Maria Del Carmen Trevino, Simona
Podlecki, Fatoumata Diallo, Lorena Garcia-
Vargas, Thu Le Coultas, Gustavo Lopez
Lemus, Piotr Henryk Ozimek, Maria Del Pilar
Parent-Quintana, Paticia Aguirre, Alyda
Frederika Willemina Veenendaal, Khristine
Mascardo Bernier, Gurpreet Kaur, Nada
Jovanoski, Anaya Alvarez Lucila, Patricia
Bugayong Fry, Miguel Avila, Nelly Berenguel
Ramirez De Vargas, Elaine Criselda Dequina
Moline, Dipika Darji, Adriana Albertina Mar-
tinez, Carmen Mendoza De Garcia, and
George Vlahos.
Although each individual has sought to be-
come a citizen of the United States for his or
her own reasons, be it for education, occupa-
tion, or to offer their loved ones better lives,
each is inspired by the fact that the United
States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln de-
scribed it, a country ‘‘. . . of the people, by
the people, and for the people.’’ They realize
that the United States is truly a free nation. By
seeking American citizenship, they have made
the decision that they want to live in a place
where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment
of the Constitution, they can practice religion
as they choose, speak their minds without fear
of punishment, and assemble in peaceful pro-
test should they choose to do so.
Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask you and
my other distinguished colleagues to join me
in congratulating these individuals who will be-
come citizens of the United States of America
on March 8, 2019. They, too, are American
citizens, guaranteed the inalienable rights to
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We,
as a free and democratic nation, congratulate
them and welcome them.

SUPPORT OF S. 47, JOHN D. DIN-
GELL, JR. CONSERVATION, MAN-
AGEMENT, AND RECREATION
ACT
HON. DOUG COLLINS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today in support of S. 47, John D. Din-
gell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and
Recreation Act. This legislation is critical to
public lands management, and contains nu-
merous important provisions.
This legislation protects three historic sites
in my home state of Georgia—the Ocmulgee
National Monument, Fort Frederica National
Monument, and Kennesaw Mountain Battle-
field Park. By doing so, the Natural Resources
Management Act will provide Georgians with
increased opportunities to appreciate our pub-
lic lands.
Importantly, the Conservation, Management,
and Recreation Act also includes the Open
Book on Equal Access to Justice Act—legisla-
tion I have been working on for years.
I introduced the Open Book for Equal Ac-
cess to Justice Act with my friends Represent-
atives COHEN, CHENEY, and PETERSON, and
Senators BARRASSO and COONS. This bipar-
tisan, bicameral legislation reinstates needed
transparency and accountability requirements
to ensure that the Equal Access to Justice Act
is helping individuals, retirees, veterans, and
small businesses as intended.
I want to thank my Senate colleagues for in-
cluding the Open Book on Equal Access to
Justice Act in S. 47.
My legislation requires the Administrative
Conference of the United States (ACUS) to
develop an online searchable database that
includes information on the number, nature,
and amount of the awards, claims involved in
the controversy, and other relevant informa-
tion.
Agencies would be required to provide infor-
mation requested by ACUS for the develop-
ment and maintenance of the database.
As made clear in report language in pre-
vious years, it is our intent that ACUS take ap-
propriate measures to ensure that individual-
specific healthcare information, such as an in-
dividual’s diagnoses and treatments, is not
contained in the database.
This legislation ensures appropriate protec-
tions are in place, while facilitating critical pub-
lic and Congressional oversight.

DANIEL BURNETTE
HON. ED PERLMUTTER
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Daniel
Burnette for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge
Service Ambassadors for Youth award.
Daniel Burnette is a student at Arvada High
School and received this award because his

The dedication demonstrated by Daniel

HONORING THE LIFE OF DR.
EDWARD ZIGLER
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to celebrate the extraordinary life of Dr.
Edward Zigler. Dr. Zigler, often called the ‘‘Fa-
ther of Head Start’’ was a legendary figure,
and a force for good. He was also a dear
friend whose counsel I relied on over the
years to inform my work in Congress.
He was a giant in the field of psychology
and social policy, conducting some of the
most important research in developmental
science and creating the ‘‘whole child’’ ap-
proach to education. Dr. Zigler helped to cre-
ate the Head Start program, which has served
over 35 million children and families across
the country. He was a teacher, researcher,
scholar, and mentor who helped to shape
some of the most important family and child
legislation considered in Congress.
Dr. Zigler believed that science should serve
the public interest. His contributions are with-
out parallel, from serving as the first director of
the U.S. Office of Child Development—which
would later become the U.S. Administration for
Children and Families—to advising on child
and family policy to officials in nine consecu-
tive White House administrations. At every
step, he strived and succeeded in making the
lives of countless children better because he
understood that their wellbeing was directly
linked to their family and community. Dr. Zigler
will live on in those he prepared to carry on
his work, and in the children whose lives he
helped to shape.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the
House to join me in celebrating the life of Dr.
Edward Zigler. Through boundless wisdom, he
charted a vision for how to best help children
and families that shaped child nutrition, health,
injury prevention, and so much more. His im-
pact spanned decades, and will last well into
the future. He will be dearly missed.

INTRODUCTION OF THE BAYARD
RUSTIN STAMP ACT
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to introduce the Bayard Rustin Stamp Act.
This bill would direct the United States Post-
master General to issue a forever stamp to
commemorate the life and work of Bayard
Rustin.
Born March 17, 1912, Bayard Rustin be-
came one of the most important leaders in the
20th century civil rights movement. At a young
age, Rustin learned the values of nonviolence
and peacekeeping from his grandparents’
Quaker faith, and he would continue to build
these values into his life as a civil rights move-
ment leader.
Rustin attended City College of New York,
where he joined a progressive club that aimed
to remedy racial issues during turbulent times.
His time with the club was short lived, but it
inspired him to join the Fellowship of Rec-
onciliation, an organization that became a
champion for labor rights, equity and world
peace.
His time with the Fellowship of Reconcili-
ation led Rustin to become a leader in the
1947 ‘‘Journey to Reconciliation,’’ where white
and black people across the South rode buses
together to challenge segregation laws, a pre-
cursor to the Freedom Rides.
Rustin was an advisor in Martin Luther King,
Jr.’s inner circle as he advocated pacifism and
nonviolence for achieving equal treatment for
African Americans. He applied his brilliant
strategic mind to the use of aggressive,
peaceful action in the civil rights movement
and throughout his life as an activist.
His most important role was as the chief or-
ganizer of the 1963 March on Washington,
D.C., the largest demonstration ever organized
at the time, in which a quarter of a million peo-
ple turned out to demand civil rights for Afri-
can Americans.
In the years after the civil rights movement,
Rustin used his background as a gay man to
inspire others to advocate for and to achieve
LGBT rights. He remained a strategist and
public speaker for workers’ rights movements,
including co-founding the A. Philip Randolph
Institute for black trade union members. Rustin
committed to promoting social good, and ad-
vocating for the disenfranchised, until his
death, in 1987.
I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion.

Christian Castillo is a student at Jefferson

termination and hard work have allowed him

The dedication demonstrated by Christian

ment that can be attained with hard work and

cation and develop a work ethic which will

RECOGNIZING CAROLINE
BUECHNER AS THE SANTA ROSA
COUNTY TEACHER OF THE YEAR
HON. MATT GAETZ
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Caroline Buechner as the Teacher of
the Year for Santa Rosa County, Florida.
Ms. Buechner is the Choral Music Educator
at Navarre High School. She has served the
Santa Rosa County School District with excep-
tional passion and an unwavering commitment
to excellence.
It is recognized that the teaching profession
is one of the most difficult yet rewarding pro-
fessions in existence. Ms. Buechner has con-
tinued to exceed all expectations and proves
her devotion to her profession in a multitude of
ways.
During Ms. Buechner’s 9 years at Navarre
High School, she has impressively grown the
choral program from 80 members, to over 200
members.
Ms. Buechner exhibits her passion every
day in her actions. Her unmistakable love for
her job provides a strong foundation for her
ability to successfully engage and encourage
her students.
Ms. Buechner instills a love of music in
each and every one of her students. She sets
high expectations yet provides the necessary
tools and support for her students to success-
fully meet those expectations. She encourages
students to challenge themselves and enables
them to attain their fullest potential.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United
States Congress, I am privileged to recognize
Caroline Buechner for her accomplishments
and her profound commitment to the Santa
Rosa County School District. I offer my grati-
tude for her service and wish her all the best
for continued success.

COMMEMORATING THE
INTERNATONAL DAY OF AWARE-
NESS FOR CYCLIC VOMITING
SYNDROME
HON. DARIN LaHOOD
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, today I
would like to recognize the International Day
of Awareness for Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome
(CVS).
CVS is a rare condition that impacts both
children and adults, causing severe nausea at-
tacks that can last between several hours and
several days. The cause of CVS is still un-
known. Through research and education in the
United States and in over thirty other coun-
tries, the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Associa-
tion (CVSA) is working to develop a cure for
those affected by CVS. Founded in 1993,
CVSA started modestly with eighteen families
and a few medical professionals. All those in-
volved were dedicated to working towards a
cure for the debilitating condition and through
their hard work the organization has grown
into an international coalition fostering re-
search and providing resources and support
for families suffering with CVS.
The Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association
advocates tirelessly to make others aware of
how challenging CVS can be, and how impor-
tant it is to find a cure. With assistance from
the North American Society for Pediatric Gas-
troenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and
the American Neurogastroenterology and Mo-
tility Society, the CVSA produced the nec-
essary guidelines for the diagnosis and treat-
ment of both pediatric and adult CVS and in
2012, supported a breakthrough in treating
CVS with the establishment of the first emer-
gency room protocol model.
As we recognize the International Day of
Awareness for CVS, I know they will continue
to advocate for the advancement of medical
procedures, continued research and public
awareness for this disease and the patient
community.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION
HON. SUZANNE BONAMICI

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I was un-

2019 for the vote on H.R. 539. My flight from
Oregon was delayed because of weather con-
ditions. If I had been present for the vote, I
would have voted in favor of the Innovators to
Entrepreneurs Act. This bill would expand the
National Science Foundation’s Innovation
Corps program to give scientists and engi-
neers the tools to commercialize their re-
search. I support this effort to help research-
ers bring their innovations to market, and I
commend the House on the bill’s passage.

CONGRATULATING SUGAR LAND’S
NEW FIRE CHIEF
HON. PETE OLSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to congratulate Doug Boeker for his recent
promotion to the position of Fire Chief of the
Sugar Land Fire Department.
Chief Boeker has admirably served the
Sugar Land community for the past 27 years,
joining the Sugar Land Fire Department after
graduating from a fire academy in 1992. He
helped establish the Sugar Land Fired Up 5K
and leads youth outreach programs through
Shattered Dreams, Decisions Matter and Crud
Wars. In addition Boeker implemented the
Senior Fires and Falls safety prevention pro-
gram and a critical ambulance service estab-
lished after our Sugar Land population rapidly
grew. While these accomplishments are un-
paralleled by most, Boeker didn’t stop there.
He has also served as the chief executive offi-
cer of NexGen Group, the general manager of
Intercare Health Services and as the fire com-
missioner for the Harris-Fort Bend Emergency
Services District No. 100. His service to our
community is exceptional.
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-
sional District of Texas, congratulations again
to Fire Chief Doug Boeker on his promotion.
We thank him for his dedication to keeping
Sugar Land safe.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 31ST AN-

POGROMS
HON. JACKIE SPEIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, today, we
commemorate the 31st anniversary of the
Sumgait pogroms, which saw the murder,
abuse, and eventual expulsion of Armenian
Christians living in Azerbaijan and Nagorno-
Karabakh solely based on their Armenian
identity. The Azeri government cannot be al-
lowed to continue denying its role in instigating
these atrocities and allowing them to continue,
especially in light of similar efforts to target Ar-
menians by Azerbaijan today. I hold memories
of the Sumgait victims close to my heart, they
motivate me to fight for the rights for Arme-
nians and all people.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA ZONING COMMIS-
SION HOME RULE ACT
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Zoning Com-
mission Home Rule Act. This bill would give
the District of Columbia the authority to ap-
point all members of the D.C. Zoning Commis-
sion (Commission). Currently, the Commission
consists of two federal officials (the Architect
of the Capitol (AOC) and the Director of the
National Park Service (NPS), or their des-
ignees), and three mayoral appointees, sub-
ject to D.C. Council approval. The federal offi-
cials are members even though the Commis-
sion has no authority over federal property.
Land use is a quintessential local matter in
our country. Despite the D.C. Home Rule Act,
which gave the District jurisdiction over its
local matters, 40 percent of the members of
the Commission are federal officials, who are
unaccountable to the more than 700,000 resi-
dents who live in the District. The federal gov-
ernment would lose nothing as a result of this
bill because the federal government’s land-use
interests in the nation’s capital are protected
by federal law and federal agencies.
The Commission creates the zoning maps
and regulations, which must ‘‘not be incon-
sistent with the comprehensive plan for the
national capital.’’ The mayor is responsible for
the local elements of the comprehensive plan,
subject to Council approval. The National Cap-
ital Planning Commission (NCPC), which is
the central federal planning agency for the
federal government in D.C. and approves fed-
eral projects here, is responsible for the fed-
eral elements of the comprehensive plan. This
bill would not alter the comprehensive plan
process or the authority of NCPC and the
Commission.
This bill would immediately remove the AOC
and the Director of the NPS from the Commis-
sion, and the Commission would, at least ini-
tially, consist solely of the three mayoral ap-
pointees. The District would have the authority
to reconstitute the membership of the Com-
mission through local legislation.
This is an important step to increase home
rule for the District, and I urge my colleagues
to support this bill.

COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE MARCH 1ST
KOREAN INDEPENDENCE MOVE-
MENT AND THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF THE KOREAN PROVISIONAL
GOVERNMENT
HON. JIMMY GOMEZ
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the 100th anniversary of the
March 1st Korean Independence Movement.
One hundred years ago, Korea was not a free
nation but lived under the rule of Japan.
March 1st commemorates the start of Korea’s
independence movement from Japanese colo-
nialism and 100 years ago from this day, the
people of Korea united to fight for their free-
dom.
On March 1, 1919, a group of incredibly
brave individuals banded together across the
nation and declared their freedom in a procla-
mation of Korean Independence. These indi-
viduals started a movement that not only ex-
tended throughout the Korean peninsula, but
across the world. In the struggle for freedom,
many Koreans were imprisoned and killed.
Today we recognize the Koreans who coura-
geously fought to defend their home, people,
and heritage.
As the Member of Congress representing
California’s 34th District and home to the larg-
est Korean population in the country, I would
like to recognize this significant day and all
those who fought for independence. I ask all
Members to join with me in celebrating the
centennial of the March 1st Korean Independ-
ence Movement.
NATURAL RESOURCES
MANAGEMENT ACT
SPEECH OF
HON. PAUL COOK
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 26, 2019
Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I rise along with
my colleagues, Congressman RUIZ and Con-
gressman CALVERT to speak to S. 47, the Nat-
ural Resources Management Act and a provi-
sion that I introduced as part of the California
Desert Protection and Recreation Act of 2019,
specifically Section 1457 as it relates to the
designation of the Whitewater River as a Wild
and Recreational River.
The City of Banning and the Community of
Banning Heights, which are in the district of
Mr. RUIZ, receive a vital source of water from
a flume that conveys water from the head-
waters of the Whitewater River, which is lo-
cated in my district.
In 1913, the State of California recognized
the appropriative state water rights that the
City of Banning and Banning Heights Mutual
Water Company use to divert water from the
headwaters of the Whitewater River into the
San Gorgonio watershed. In 1918, the U.S.
Secretary of the Interior approved the right-of-
way for the diversion structures and the flume
that carries the water to the City and to Ban-
ning Heights. These communities have relied
on this water for over a century—water that is
critical for drinking, cooking, washing, and fire
control. The two communities own the water
rights, which provide 100 percent of the water
for the community of Banning Heights and ap-
proximately 30 percent of the water for the
City of Banning.
In designating the Whitewater River as a
Wild and Recreational River, we speak with
one voice in saying that we do not wish in any
way to interfere with these historic rights. We
recognize that the downstream portions of the
Whitewater River already have the necessary
flows for the Wild and Recreational designa-
tions and that additional flows are not needed
to maintain or enhance these designations. As
the primary sponsor of the legislation con-
taining the Whitewater designation in the
House, I in particular, wish to underscore this
as a matter of legislative history and Congres-
sional intent. We ask that the Forest Service
and the BLM in implementing the Wild and
Recreational River designations heed this
Congressional intent and incorporate it into
any land management plan amendment and
other implementing documents.
We also want to be sure that the United
States Forest Service—specifically the San
Bernardino National Forest—heeds the in-
structions from the FY19 Interior Appropria-
tions bill (P.L. 116–6) that reminds the Depart-
ment of the Interior and the Forest Service of
the states’ jurisdiction over water law and ex-
pect that all applicable laws will be followed
when considering a request for a permit or
permit renewal.
The U.S. Forest Service, Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, Bureau of Land Man-
agement, and other agencies should not now,
or in the future, point to the designation of the
Whitewater River as a Wild and Recreational
River as a justification to require the City of
Banning or the Banning Heights Mutual Water
Company to relinquish their state-granted
water rights nor should such agencies require
the removal of diversions at the headwaters of
the Whitewater River and the flume that are
necessary for these communities to receive
water appropriated to them by the State of
California.

INTRODUCTION OF THE MOVE
AMERICA ACT
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today
I introduced the Move American Act of 2019.
This bipartisan legislation will spur private in-
vestment in airports, ports, transit, freight and
passenger rail, bridges, flood projects, inland
and coastal waterway improvements, waste-
water and sewage facilities, and broadband in-
frastructure.
The Move America Act will bring billions of
dollars of investment to state and local gov-
ernments to help grow and repair America’s
aging infrastructure. The legislation creates
Move America Bonds, which provides states
the ability to issue tax-exempt bonds in part-
nership with private entities to expand infra-
structure investment. The legislation also al-
lows states to trade in some or all of their
bond allocation for Move America Credits,
which can be used to help finance individual
projects, or be allocated to state infrastructure
banks or infrastructure revolving funds. To be
clear, this legislation is not a panacea to solve
all of our infrastructure needs, we need more
direct funding. The Move America Act is an
important aspect of our strategy to rebuild and
renew America. I look forward to working with
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to
pass it into law.

CELEBRATING THE LIFETIME OF
EXCELLENCE IN MINISTRY AND
EDUCATION OF JESSE BERNARD
BILBERRY, JR.
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND
OF LOUISIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Speaker, I join
former Congressman Cleo Fields and the en-
tire Baton Rouge community today in honor of
Reverend Jesse Bernard Bilberry, Jr. Rev. Bil-
berry has spent the entirety of his life dedi-
cated to educational and community develop-
ment. Revered as a trailblazer throughout his
lifetime, Rev. Bilberry most recently retired
after 34 years of pastoral service at Mt. Pil-
grim Missionary Baptist Church in Baton
Rouge.
Rev. Bilberry was born on May 12, 1929 in
Marion, Louisiana the oldest of ten children of
Jesse Bernard Bilberry, Sr. and Joe B. Bil-
berry. He was baptized at the age of 14 at the
Bloomberg Grove Baptist Church in
Farmerville, Louisiana. Rev. Bilberry went on
to earn his Bachelor of Arts degree from
Southern University and A&M College. An
Army veteran, Rev. Bilberry was honorably
discharged from the United States Army after
serving from August 18, 1951 to July 21,
1953.
After Rev. Bilberry’ s return from the Army,
he went on to marry Verta Lee Hamilton on
December 23, 1953. The couple has one
daughter, Cassandra Gail.
Rev. Bilberry began a new chapter in life
after marriage that started his esteemed tra-
jectory in educational and community develop-
ment. He began his career as the principal of
Tensas Rosenwald High School in St. Joseph,
Louisiana from 1956 to 1969. During this time,
he completed his Master of Education from
Louisiana State University in 1957. He was
also awarded the Human Rights Award for
Creative Leadership in Education in 1968.
In 1969, Rev. Bilberry took his talents back
to Southern University where he served as the
Freshman Complex Director until 1971. He
then implemented and directed the inaugural
Office of High School Relations at Southern
from 1971 to 1973. The following year, Rev.
Bilberry was promoted to Director of Admis-
sions of Southern University, where he served
this role until 1984.
During his early years as Director of Admis-
sions for Southern, Rev. Bilberry first became
acquainted with Mount Pilgrim Baptist Church
in 1975. He was later ordained a Deacon and
asked to serve as the Chairman of the Fi-
nance Committee. By 1981, he became an
Associate Minister.
Rev. Bilberry retired from Southern Univer-
sity and the State of Louisiana in 1984. That
same year, he accepted the pastorate of Mt.
Pilgrim Baptist Church. Rev. Bilberry contin-
ued his studies of the church and graduated
from Christian Bible College in 1988 with a
Master of Theology and a Doctorate of The-
ology in 1990.
Throughout his lifetime, Rev. Bilberry has
received numerous awards and recognition,
including Minister of the Year in 1989 from the
Early Risers Kiwanis Club, two-time recipient
of the M.S. Tally Walk on the Water Award
from the Department of Christian Education in
1991 and 1992, and the Frontiersman Award
from the Sunday School Publishing Board of
the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. in
1993 for his work leading a mission trip to
Dominica, West Indies.
Rev. Bilberry has also dedicated his time to
a plethora of scholastic and service-oriented
organizations, including the Southern Univer-
sity and A&M College Board of Supervisors,
supervisor and instructor for the National Bap-
tist Congress of Christian Education, and a
member of East Baton Rouge Parish Ministers
Conference, Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, and
Phi Delta Kappa Honorary Society.
Rev. Bilberry’s trajectory in leadership con-
tinued as Chairman of the Board of Directors
of Crestworth Learning Academy, President of
the Fourth District Missionary Baptist Associa-
tion, and State Director of the Louisiana Mis-
sionary Baptist Congress of Christian Edu-
cation.
Rev. Bilberry has led a life of exemplary
service, leadership, and compassion that has
resonated throughout the entire Baton Rouge
community and the state of Louisiana. His life-
time body of work should be well known and
celebrated not only by those he has influenced
throughout the years, but by all who seek to
make a difference in this world through the vo-
cation of ministry and education.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor the
life and work of Rev. Jesse Bernard Bilberry,
Jr. and wish him luck in his retirement.

INTRODUCTION OF THE BICYCLE
COMMUTER ACT
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today
I introduced the Bicycle Commuter Act of
2019. This bipartisan legislation will reinstate
the bicycle commuter tax benefit, modify the
benefit to be used in concert with parking and
transit benefits, and expand the bicycle benefit
to include bikeshare.
The bicycle is the most efficient form of
urban transportation ever devised. Cycling re-
duces carbon emissions, provides enormous
physical and mental health benefits, and is
one of the most cost-effective modes of trans-
portation available. Communities across the
country have realized these benefits and sub-
stantially invested in building better bike net-
works and improving facilities for biking to
work. Across America, more than 100 commu-
nities of all sizes have installed or permitted
bikeshare systems, supporting a nationwide
network of nearly 5,000 stations, more than
100,000 bikes, and more than 120 million trips
since 2010. These investments are one of the
reasons that rates of biking to work have near-
ly doubled since 2000 while driving and public
transportation rates have increased by 16 per-
cent and 26 percent, respectively.
Despite these impressive developments,
there is currently no commuter tax benefit for
biking to work. Public Law 115–97 suspended
the bicycle commuting reimbursement benefit
through 2025, taking away a valuable financial
incentive for people who choose to bike to
work. The Bicycle Commuter Act reverses the
benefit’s suspension, changes the structure of
the benefit to be more flexible to, and adds
bikeshare as eligible for the benefit. Employ-
ees don’t commute the same way every day
and our commuter tax benefits should reflect
that. The Bicycle Commuter Act provides the
flexibility that people need while also
incentivizing a clean and healthy mode of
transportation: the bicycle.

haraja Sayajirao University in Baroda, India in
1969. Following graduation, Dr. Shah com-
pleted an internship and his residency at
Shree Sayaji General Hospital in Baroda,
India, the Albert Einstein Medical Center and
Philadelphia General Hospital in Pennsylvania.
Dr. Shah did a fellowship in Pediatric Cardi-
ology at St. Christopher’s Hospital for Children
in Philadelphia, and then led research at the
Congenital Heart Disease Research & Train-
ing Center’s Hekteon Institute for Medical Re-
search in Chicago, Illinois. He has also served
in the academic world, most recently as Clin-
ical Professor of Pediatrics at the University of
Illinois College of Medicine in Peoria. Dr. Shah
is a part of many scientific organizations and
has received two teaching awards for his time
in academia. I would like to wish Dr. Shah well
as he begins his well-earned retirement and
thank him for his many contributions to med-
ical research.
It is because of dedicated leaders such as
Dr. Jitendra Shah that I am especially proud to
serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional District.
Madam Speaker, I would like to again formally
congratulate Dr. Jitendra Shah on his retire-
ment and thank him for his service to the Peo-
ria community.

HON. PETE OLSON

INTRODUCTION OF STOP
UNDERRIDES ACT OF 2019
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of the Stop Underrides Act, a bipartisan,
bicameral bill I introduced earlier today along
with my colleague on the Transportation & In-
frastructure Committee, Representative MARK
DESAULNIER from California, and in the Sen-
ate, Senators KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND and MARCO
RUBIO, to prevent deadly truck underride
crashes.
An underride crash is when a car collides
with a truck and goes underneath the body of
the truck. Modern car safety features are de-
signed to ensure that a passenger can walk
away from a crash where the vehicle hits a
solid wall at 35 miles per hour. In an underride
crash, the first part of a car coming into con-
tact with a truck body is the windshield, and
as a result, a car’s safety features are ren-
dered useless. When a car collides with a
truck, it will keep moving forward, and decapi-
tation is a serious threat at 35 miles per hour.
While large trucks have been federally re-
quired to have rear underride guards since
1953, there is no requirement to adequately
maintain rear underride guards and they often
fail. In addition, underride guards are not fed-
erally required to be on the sides or front of
trucks. Too many lives have been lost or for-
ever altered by these preventable crashes and
the time has come for Congress to act.
The Stop Underrides Act does just that—
lays out a path to bring an end to these ter-
rible and all too often fatal accidents by requir-
ing all large truck trailers to have front, side,
and rear underride guards.
These guards, if installed, would have likely
prevented the death ofMichael Higginbotham,
who was killed in an underride crash in Mem-
phis and whose parents, Randy and Laurie
Higginbotham, have been urging Congress to
take action on this long overdue issue.
This is common sense legislation that will
save lives. I urge my colleagues to support the
passage of the Stop Underrides Act.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE SESQUI-
CENTENNIAL OF THE CITY OF
OCONTO
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the City of Oconto’s ses-
quicentennial.
Nestled on the coast of Green Bay, the City
of Oconto is the home to thousands of Wis-
consinites. The city hosts thirty-three sites list-
ed on the National Register of Historic Places
and in its 150 years, it has seen tremendous
growth and prosperity.
First settled by the Copper Culture People
over 6,000 years ago, Oconto is rich with his-
tory and culture. The Copper Culture People,
rightfully named for their role as some of the
earliest copper workers in the Americas, made
a variety of tools and ornaments, many of
which can still be found today in Oconto at the
Copper Culture State Park. When Jesuit mis-
sionaries arrived in Oconto in the mid-1600s,
Oconto became vital in building the trade rela-
tionships that helped so-called ‘‘New France’’
to prosper. The Copper Culture People, along
with ancestors of the Menominee who had
settled there, traded beaver and other furs for
various goods and tools with the European
settlers.
Oconto experienced a population boom dur-
ing the 19th and 20th centuries. Located di-
rectly on the Chicago and Northwestern Rail-
road, Oconto became a hub for the growing
commercial lumber and fishing industries.
Americans were in search of a beautiful place
to earn a living and raise a family, and this
wonderful city in Northeast Wisconsin offered
them just that.
Today, several industries have expanded
and are expected to continue to grow, creating
new jobs and boosting the local economy.
Oconto’s small-town fishing lifestyle has con-
tinued to play a crucial role in the economy,
attracting anglers from across the United
States fishing for walleye at its Breakwater
Park on the Bay.
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to congratu-
late the City of Oconto on 150 years of com-
munity, industry, and success. As citizens
committed to preserving the vibrant history of
their home and watching it grow and prosper,
the people of Oconto truly embody what it
means to be a Wisconsinite: to strive forward.
I wish them another 150 years of prosperity.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to thank James ‘‘Buck’’ Gilcrease on his years
of dedication and service to the students and
faculty of Alvin ISD.
Since assuming the Superintendent position
in 2014, James has overseen the opening of
seven new schools in the district. James led
the district through multiple successful bond
elections which were needed because of un-
precedented population growth. During his
tenure, seven new schools were opened by
Alvin ISD. Even though James is retiring, he
plans to continue his legacy advocating for the
advancement of our children’s education.
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-
sional District of Texas, thank you again to
James ‘‘Buck’’ Gilcrease for his years of dedi-
cation and commitment to academic excel-
lence at Alvin ISD. While we are sad to see
him leave Alvin ISD, we wish him the best in
his future endeavors.

HONORING ARCHIE ARCHULETA
HON. BEN McADAMS
OF UTAH
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life of one of Utah’s finest.
On January 25th, Utah lost Archie Archuleta—
a longtime community activist. Archie was a
shining beacon of hope, leading by example
on how to be a champion for marginalized
groups and for the causes of civil liberties and
peace in the State of Utah. He believed that
‘‘truth needs witnesses’’ and each person’s
voice matters.
Archie was born near Grand Junction, Colo-
rado, the child of farm workers who picked
sugar beets, lettuce and other crops. After get-
ting his bachelor’s degree in education, he
came to Salt Lake to teach elementary school.
He met the love of his life, Lois, and together
they raised five children.
Archie served as president of the Coalition
of La Raza for nine years and for his work on
behalf of the Latino Community, he was rec-
ognized by many for his efforts.
I’ll always remember Archie’s calls and visits
to my office to share his thoughts and advice.
He cared deeply about our community and
worked hard to make all of us better. I was in-
spired by Archie’s fiery speeches at public ral-
lies and humble mentorship in more private
moments.
Archie was someone bigger than life—a
man who left his mark on so many of the peo-
ple with whom he came in contact. We mourn
his passing but celebrate the legacy of this
fierce advocate and gentle teacher.

Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Dr. Richard Pearl for his retire-
ment as Professor of Surgery and Pediatrics
at the University of Illinois College of Medicine

Surgical Simulation at the Jump Simulation
and Education Center at OSF HealthCare and
is completing a long career of service through
medicine.
Dr. Richard Pearl began his distinguished
career after he received a medical degree
from Wright State University in 1980. Dr. Pearl
first gained experience as a Surgical Intern at
Madigan Army Medical Center prior to com-
pleting his residency at Harvard Surgical Serv-
ice in Boston, and a fellowship focused on Pe-
diatric Surgery in Toronto, Canada. In addition
to these outstanding achievements, Dr. Pearl
honorably served our nation as a Colonel in
the U.S. Army. He began his military service
as an infantry officer and helicopter pilot be-
fore joining the Army Medical Corps. In the
Army Medical Corps, Dr. Pearl served in Op-
eration Desert Storm as Deputy Commander
of a Combat Support Hospital and Com-
mander of a Forward Surgical Team in Saudi
Arabia and Iraq. This extraordinary service
earned Dr. Pearl many recognitions and acco-
lades, including three Bronze Stars, the Le-
gion of Merit and the Air Medal for Valor. I
would like to wish Dr. Pearl well as he begins
his well-earned retirement.
It is because of dedicated leaders such as
Dr. Richard Pearl that I am especially proud to

Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today

Chandler is the first UIL Congressional De-
bate qualifier in the history of Katy High

the role of a mock legislator. Students work
hard to prepare their bills and resolutions,
which they then debate with their competitors
as they work toward passing laws. Although
he has already made history, Chandler says
that there is no added pressure on his per-
formance. Instead, he is proud to represent
his school at the competition. Chandler, whose
mother is a 1984 refugee from Afghanistan,
says her work ethic and perseverance helped
shape him into the person he is today.

Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, I
rise to honor the life and legacy of Notre
Dame Law School Professor Thomas L.
Shaffer, a true icon who passed away last
week. Tom Shaffer was a teacher, mentor and
friend to generations of Notre Dame Law stu-
dents. I was privileged to be one of those stu-
dents whose life and career benefitted so
much from that experience.
Tom Shaffer began his teaching career at
Notre Dame in 1963 after graduating from the
Law School two years earlier. Besides his abil-
ity in the classroom Professor Shaffer served
as Dean from 1971–1975 and was a re-
nowned legal ethics scholar and prolific legal
author having written more than 300 scholarly
works.
Most important was Tom Shaffer’s lasting
impact on so many students to whom he im-
parted his dedication to strong legal thinking
and analysis founded on ethics and moral re-
sponsibility.
Tom Shaffer was a good man and that
goodness is being reflected in the outpouring
of statements from so many of his former stu-
dents since his death. All of us have Tom
Shaffer in our thoughts and prayers and send
our sincerest condolences to his wonderful
wife Nancy and their children and grand-
children.

the Top Micropolitan Community in the United
States for the fifth year in a row. The issuing
magazine, Site Selection, announced the 2019
award by describing Findlay as ‘‘being pro-
pelled into superstar status.’’
To be considered, a micropolitan city must
have a population ranging from 10,000 to
50,000. Over 500 of these cities were evalu-
ated on business growth and economic sus-
tainability. With Findlay’s 23 projects that met
Site Selection’s criteria, it surpassed the com-
petition and secured the ‘‘five-peat.’’
Fostering a cooperative environment be-
tween the community, business, and local
government has allowed for continued eco-
nomic growth in Findlay. This success would
not be possible without the commendable ef-
forts of the Findlay government, the Findlay-
Hancock County Economic Development of-
fice, the Hancock County Commissioners, and
the entire Findlay community.
Madam Speaker, Findlay has routinely
served as an example of what a strong com-
munity and a commitment to its prosperity can
do by implementing their renowned ‘‘Findlay
Formula.’’ This formula continues to pay divi-
dends and serves as an example to cities
across the country.
I congratulate Findlay for another year as

AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY
HEALTH
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, March 5, 2019
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, I want to thank the Academy of Nu-
trition and Dietetics who prepared this state-
ment for me in acknowledgement of Black His-
tory Month.
Minority populations, especially the African
American population, continue to remain in rel-
atively poor health when compared to the ma-
jority population, and also continue to be un-
derserved by the health care system.
One of the biggest health challenges facing
our country today is obesity, and the African
American community is especially at risk. In a
2015–2016 study by the CDC, the report
found non-Hispanic black (46.8 percent) adults
had a higher prevalence of obesity than non-
Hispanic white adults (37.9 percent).
Compared to other states, Illinois’ obesity
rate is a significant area of concern, with 31.1
percent adults having obesity. This statistic is
higher than the U.S. median.
Illinois has the twenty-seventh highest adult
obesity rate in the nation, and the seventh
highest obesity rate for youth ages 10 to 17.
Chicago’s African American community is
the demographic with the highest obesity rate
at 39.8 percent.
With such a high percentage of the African
American community falling in the obese cat-
egory, the demographic runs a higher risk for
obesity-related conditions, including heart dis-
ease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain
types of cancer that are some of the leading
causes of preventable, premature death. Com-
pared to the general population, African Amer-
icans are disproportionately affected by diabe-
tes.
Adult Illinoisans with hypertension is 32.32
percent, while 11 percent have diabetes—both
illnesses directly related to obesity.
13.2 percent of all African Americans aged
20 years or older have diagnosed diabetes.
African Americans are 1.7 times more likely
to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites.
African-Americans are significantly more
likely to suffer from blindness, kidney disease
and amputations.
Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney fail-
ure in African Americans. African Americans
are twice as likely to be diagnosed with diabe-
tes as Caucasians.
Approximately 4.9 million African Americans
over 20 years of age are living with either di-
agnosed or undiagnosed diabetes.
African Americans constitute more than 35
percent of all patients in the U.S. receiving di-
alysis for kidney failure, but only represent
13.2 percent of the overall U.S. population.
High blood pressure is the second leading
kidney failure among African Americans, and
remains the leading cause of death due to its
link with heart attacks and strokes.
With these troubling statistics, where do we
go from here? Awareness, education, and ac-
cess are the keys to changing our nation’s
health. And food and nutrition practitioners
play a very important role in leading the health
revolution.
Obesity is partially attributed to poor nutri-
tional intake and has been implicated as a
contributor to cancer, heart disease, stroke,
arid diabetes. Food and nutrition practitioners
have an opportunity and an ethical obligation
to positively influence the health care experi-
ence of individuals.
These experts have the power to influence
factors affecting health disparities at the indi-
vidual and the population level, including pro-
grams such as SNAP, WIC, adult care food
programs, and other nutrition programs. By
connecting with individuals who are most at
risk, food and nutrition practitioners can make
a huge change when it comes to the health of
African Americans, as well as all Americans.
