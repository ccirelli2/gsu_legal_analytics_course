(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, congratulations to Prime
Minister Narendra Modi for his land-
slide victory on May 23, as 600 million
Indians went to the polls.
After the elections, Prime Minister
Modi called for a ‘‘strong and inclusive
India.’’ According to The Washington
Times, Modi said, ‘‘This election has
become a movement of social unity,’’
and that his government would work to
earn the trust of all Indians, including
religious minorities such as Muslims
and Christians.
India’s rising global standing is due
in large part to the leadership of Prime
Minister Modi, who has promoted free
enterprise to create jobs. His reelection
reinforces the strategic partnership be-
tween India and the United States.
Best wishes to Prime Minister Modi
on his next term. India is appreciated
as the world’s largest democracy by
America, which is the oldest democ-
racy. India is well represented in Wash-
ington by Ambassador Harsh Vardhan
Shringla.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.

the date of enactment of this Act until such
grantee has reached a final agreement on all
fixed cost estimates within the timeline provided
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency:
Provided further, That prior to making any
grant of funds allocated pursuant to this sec-
tion, the Secretary must receive from the grantee
information that allows the Secretary to certify

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

The Chair recognizes the gentle-

GENERAL LEAVE
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the Sen-
ate amendment to H.R. 2157, currently
under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, today we are rejecting
the political stunts and grandstanding
that have made it difficult to deliver
much-needed disaster relief to families
and communities across America. It
has been 9 months since Hurricane
Florence struck the Southeast, just
one of the many natural disasters—in-
cluding other hurricanes, Pacific ty-
phoons, and Western wildfires—that
impacted our fellow Americans last
year.
In that time, the House has already
passed two strong packages of relief
and recovery assistance; bills to help
the people of Puerto Rico recover from
one of the deadliest and costliest
storms in American history and to
meet urgent needs following Midwest
floods and Southern tornadoes. Those
bills were held up because some in our
government refused to assist our fellow
Americans in Puerto Rico who are still
recovering from a 2017 hurricane. I am
pleased we have moved past that, be-
cause when disaster strikes, we
shouldn’t let a ZIP Code dictate our re-
sponse, and Americans across the coun-
try have been waiting far too long for
the relief and recovery assistance they
deserve.
That is why so many of us were deep-
ly disappointed last week when this bi-
partisan, bicameral disaster relief bill
was blocked three times by House Re-
publicans, even though it has the sup-
port of the President, Senate Repub-
licans, and congressional Democrats
and has passed in the Senate.
While it has taken far too long, this
bill delivers much-needed assistance to
American communities struck by re-
cent natural disasters. It includes a
broad array of measures—totaling $19.1
billion—to meet urgent needs: assist-
ance for farmers and rural commu-
nities who have been devastated by
crop losses brought on by storms; fund-
ing for infrastructure repairs that will
create jobs and revitalize broken com-
munities; approximately $1.4 billion for
Puerto Rico, including $600 million in
nutrition assistance; funding to sta-
bilize healthcare systems in disaster-
stricken Pacific territories; and repairs
and reconstruction at damaged Federal
facilities, including military bases that
are critical to national security.
The bill represents bipartisanship
compromise that will strengthen com-
munities and make lives better.
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to its en-
actment, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 2157, the Supplemental Appro-
priations Act of 2019. This bill provides
much-needed relief to more than 40
States and territories to help them re-
cover from devastating hurricanes,
wildfires, flooding, and tornadoes.
The bill provides critical aid to farm-
ers and ranchers across the country.
From the Category 5 hurricane that de-
stroyed crops in the Southeast to the
historic floods to farmland in the Mid-
west and fires in the West, billions of
dollars of damage have occurred. The
funds in this bill will help restore the
livelihoods of our agricultural pro-
ducers and rural communities.
The bill also provides critical funding
to repair military installations that
were severely damaged by hurricanes
and floods. This assistance will return
these facilities to a condition that can
support our men and women in uniform
and help them get back to the job of
protecting our Nation.
The bill provides vital funding for
community development block grants
to help rebuild areas devastated by
hurricanes, floods, and wildfires. I have
seen how critical these funds have been
for the State of Texas in the aftermath
of Hurricane Harvey.
The communities affected by storms
in 2018 and 2019 have been waiting for
these critical resources for months
now, and I am pleased we are taking
action today to provide needed relief to
restore housing and businesses where it
is so desperately needed.
The bill also provides funds to com-
pensate State departments of transpor-
tation for road and highway repairs al-
ready underway or completed. This
funding will go to dozens of States for
disaster repairs that are critical to re-
storing roads that are vital to both the
traveling public and the movement of
goods across the Nation.
The bill provides significant funding
for the Army Corps of Engineers, most
of which will be used to repair existing
projects to pre-storm conditions. This
work will include dredging navigation
channels, preparing levees, and reforti-
fying coastal defenses.
Funding will be used for the most
critical repairs following storms in pre-
vious years, as well as the ongoing
flooding in the Midwest. Funding for
the Corps also includes work to study
and construct new projects to protect
against future storms. These projects
will help protect our people, busi-
nesses, and property and will reduce
the funding necessary to recover from
future storms.
Finally, this bill was stalled for
months because of the administration’s
concerns about providing additional as-
sistance to Puerto Rico. The final
agreement removes the most problem-
atic language. Bringing this bill to the
floor today shows that we can put poli-
tics aside and work together to address
the needs of our Nation.
However, one emergency that is not
addressed is the humanitarian and se-
curity crisis on the border. We must
work together to pass a bill that ad-
dresses the surge of unaccompanied
children crossing the border and pro-
vides law enforcement agencies with
the funding they need. I have made sev-
eral recent visits to the border and
have seen this crisis unfold up close.
The numbers are alarming. Customs
and Border Patrol is exceeding 100,000
apprehensions per month. The stakes
are high. There are serious life-and-
death repercussions if the Congress
does not act.
In closing, I want to thank Chair-
woman LOWEY for working with mem-
bers on my side of the aisle to reach
this compromise on disaster assistance.
I also thank the Senate Appropriations
Committee chairman and vice chair-
man, Senator SHELBY and Senator
LEAHY, for their work on this bill. I
look forward to our continuing con-
versations about how to quickly ad-
dress the needs on the border.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.

Northern Mariana Islands (Mr.
SABLAN).
Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, 8 months
after Typhoon Mangkhut and 7 months
after Super Typhoon Yutu, we are fi-
nally ready to send a disaster relief bill
to the President for signature. Of
course, this has taken longer than any
of us might wish. But I want to use my
time simply to say thank you to my
fellow Americans who are always will-
ing to help when they see a neighbor in
need.
Is not this attitude of charity for all,
as Lincoln said, what binds our Nation?
Almost 50 years ago, the people of
the Northern Mariana Islands, whom I
represent here, voted to join the United
States. It is at moments like this that
we remember what a wise decision that
was and what a great nation we are
now part of.
On behalf of all in the Northern Mar-
iana Islands who suffer to this day be-
cause of the lasting effects of Typhoons
Mangkhut and Yutu, I say thank you.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
3 minutes to the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. COLE).
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I want to
thank my friend, the distinguished
ranking member of the full Appropria-
tions Committee, for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support
of this supplemental appropriation cov-
ering numerous disasters. Communities
hit by hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes,
and other natural disasters have been
waiting too long for this needed relief.
Over 40 States will be able to receive
long-needed funding provided by this
bill.
The bill provides critical aid to help
farmers and ranchers recover from
losses to crops and livestock. Funding
for cities and schools that have had
their infrastructure damaged by nat-
ural disasters will be able to begin nec-
essary repairs to buildings.
The bill includes $50 million for the
Department of Labor’s dislocated
worker national reserve. This funding
will go to States to create temporary
employment opportunities to assist
with cleanup and recovery efforts for
areas impacted by a disaster.
The bill includes over $300 million for
the Department of Health and Human
Services, and $80 million is provided to
support community health centers for
construction, equipment, and
healthcare services for low-income pop-
ulations. The bill provides $20 million
for the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention to assess and mitigate envi-
ronmental hazards, and $100 million is
targeted to mental health and sub-
stance use services, helping people re-
build and recover.
The bill includes $30 million for
childcare services and over $50 million
to repair damaged Head Start facili-
ties. The bill includes $25 million for
the community services block grant,
flexible funding that supports a range
of social services for vulnerable popu-
lations.
The Department of Education re-
ceives $165 million to help restart oper-
ations at elementary and secondary
schools and colleges and universities in
areas damaged by natural disasters.
This funding will also support school
districts and colleges and universities
outside of the affected areas receiving
students displaced by the storms and
other covered disasters.
Before I close, Mr. Speaker, I would
be remiss if I didn’t mention what is
not in this bill, and that is more than
$4 billion to deal with the intolerable
situation at the southern border. This
money has been requested by the ad-
ministration. Most of that money is to
take care of the unprecedented influx
of unaccompanied minors. Our Demo-
cratic friends claim they care about
these young people, but they fail to
provide the funds needed that are re-
quired to feed, house, and provide med-
ical care to this population. This is
something that we need to look at and,
frankly, deal with immediately.
As past chairman and now ranking
member for the subcommittee that
looks after the Department of Health
and Human Services, I can tell you
they are on the verge of running out of
money, and we are going to have a real
disaster with young people that I know
none of us wants.
So I want to urge my friends to turn
their attention to that urgent matter
and work with the administration on
it. I urge passage of the legislation, Mr.
Speaker.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve
the balance of my time.
b 1515
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. DIAZ-BALART).
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today in strong support of this sup-
plemental funding bill. This funding
bill is critical to the panhandle of Flor-
ida as they recover, Mr. Speaker, from
Hurricane Michael.
Under T-HUD’s jurisdiction, this bill
allocates $2.4 billion for CDBG-DR and
$1.7 billion for highways. CDBG-DR is
crucial to communities to help with
unmet housing, business, and infra-
structure needs.
More broadly, Mr. Speaker, this bill
also addresses agricultural needs, in-
cluding for the timber industry that
got hit so hard in north Florida. It will
also help rebuild Tyndall Air Force
Base.
I am so proud of the work that we
have done, and I want to also thank my
counterpart, the chairman of the sub-
committee, Chairman PRICE, for his
hard work; also, Representative NEAL
DUNN of Florida, who has been an advo-
cate; as well as the appropriators from
Florida on the Appropriations Com-
mittee.
Mr. Speaker, lastly, I thank the
chairwoman, Mrs. LOWEY, and the
ranking member, Ms. GRANGER, for
their continued leadership and help,
and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. ROY).
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentlewoman from Texas and appre-
ciate all that she does for the great
State of Texas.
I rise in gratitude that this disaster
relief bill will be debated and voted on
today. It is important legislation that
impacts people suffering in the wake of
numerous emergencies and natural dis-
asters.
My Democratic colleagues tried
three separate times to pass this $19
billion disaster supplemental, which is
unpaid for and most Members haven’t
read, without Members present for a
vote through simple consent with, sole-
ly, two Members in this Chamber.
I objected, along with my colleagues
Mr. MASSIE and Mr. ROSE, to that proc-
ess because, as I said throughout the
past week, Members should cast an up-
or-down vote on major legislation that
spends a significant amount of tax-
payer money.
The American people send their Rep-
resentatives to Washington to rep-
resent them. They deserve to see how
we vote.
While I am happy the Speaker chose
to go back to regular procedure, I am
still troubled that we are poised to
spend $19 billion that is not paid for
when we are racking up approximately
$100 million an hour in national debt.
At some point, before it is too late,
Congress will get serious about re-
straining out-of-control spending.
In the 10 days this body recessed
since the Friday before Memorial Day,
we have racked up approximately $24
billion in additional debt. At least
today we are voting, which is what I
requested all along.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I
strongly support the supplemental ap-
propriations bill and urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, today
will be the third time since January
that the House has passed an emer-
gency disaster package, the third time
we have advanced relief and recovery
assistance for the people—from those
in Florida and Puerto Rico to those in
California and the Carolinas, in Geor-
gia and in communities all across
America—trying to rebuild their lives
and return to normal.
Our fellow Americans have waited
long enough for the help they need
from our government, and I am pleased
this bill will deliver that help.
Mr. Speaker, I urge its swift passage
and enactment, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, once
again, I rise to support this bill.
On October 10, 2018, my district took a di-
rect hit from Hurricane Michael, one of the
most powerful storms to make landfall in U.S.
history. It slammed into the Florida Panhandle,
drove through much of the Southeast leaving

a path of destruction all the way up to Virginia.
In Georgia, many producers suffered nearly
100 percent crop losses. Hurricane Michael
killed more than 2 million chickens and dev-
astated the Georgia cotton crop, which was
nearing peak harvest, and was on track to be
the best crop in years. This was the third
straight year hurricane damage has caused
significant losses to the pecan, peanut, cotton,
vegetable, landscaping, and agritourism indus-
tries.
The Carolinas also suffered billions in dam-
ages a month earlier, from Hurricane Flor-
ence. Californians had another devastating fire
season, including both the largest and dead-
liest fires on record. In Hawaii, volcanic activity
caused pineapple farmers nearly $30M in
damages. Americans in the Northern Mariana
Islands and American Samoa were also hit by
violent cyclones.
To meet these needs, this House passed
and sent to the Senate an emergency supple-
mental appropriations bill on January 16, 2019
that allocated $14.17 billion in emergency
spending to help families and communities re-
cover from these hurricanes, wildfires, and
other natural disasters. For agriculture, it pro-
vided $3 billion for crop losses, $150 million
for the Rural Community Facilities Program;
$480 million for the Emergency Forest Res-
toration Program; $125 million for the Emer-
gency Watershed Program. It provided $600
million in desperately needed funds to help
with Puerto Rico’s continued recovery from
Hurricane Maria in 2017. Thanks to my fellow
Georgian, AUSTIN SCOTT, and the House lead-
ership on a bi-partisan basis for quickly getting
this bill passed.
But as we passed it, the Trump Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) issued a
Statement of Administration Policy, saying
‘‘The FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund (DRF)—a
significant mechanism through which the Fed-
eral Government conducts response efforts for
major disasters and emergencies—has suffi-
cient balances to address all immediate
threats to life and property resulting from
these recent disasters.’’
Meaning: no additional funds were required
for disasters.
I strongly disagree, farmers and commu-
nities in all the impacted States and territories
disagree, and even the USDA disagrees.
The emergency supplemental appropriations
bill was stalled in the Senate for 4 long
months with no action and no relief for Ameri-
cans who are suffering. When it finally passed
in the Senate on May 23, 2019, I returned to
Washington during recess to ask for unani-
mous consent for the House to pass the up-
dated disaster bill. Unfortunately, it was
blocked.
I cannot understand why anyone would play
politics when communities coast to coast and
the territories remain in catastrophic hard
times. America’s farmers are living through the
worst economic crisis in almost 30 years, driv-
en by low commodity prices, trade war pres-
sures, and natural disasters. Those impacted
have had their patience stretched thin, and
cannot wait any longer for the disaster assist-
ance they were promised. Right now due to
disaster losses, they cannot pay federal oper-
ational loans from last year; nor can they get
new loans to plant and operate this year.
Planting season is now. We are already in
the growing season, when conditions permit
normal plant growth. If we miss this window,
it will have long lasting effects on agricultural
production including food, fiber, building mate-
rials, and fuel that will increase costs for
American consumers all over this country.
We have entered the 2019 Atlantic hurri-
cane season, which officially began on June 1,
2019.
Today I am once again supporting an emer-
gency supplemental bill as more disasters
have hit since the last bill passed, the latest
being the terrible floods in the Midwest and
the tornadoes that ripped through Georgia and
Alabama. This expanded supplemental bill will
provide for the needs of those who suffered in
those disasters.
I will add an additional $5 billion and brings
the appropriations total to $19.1 billion, which
would cover all disasters, and get the much
needed funds to those who were so severely
devastated by Hurricane Michael. It will help
communities rebuild, assist farmers and rural
communities, provide critical health care, nutri-
tional assistance, and social services for dis-
aster victims, and repair damaged federal fa-
cilities.
I urge my House and Senate colleagues to
support this bill to finally bring relief to our
long-suffering communities.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
strong support of H.R. 2157, the Supplemental
Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2019.
This bill is a comprehensive emergency dis-
aster supplemental bill I to help meet the ur-
gent needs of American communities still
struggling to recover from recent hurricanes,
typhoons, wildfires, floods and other natural
disasters.
This bill would have been signed into law
much earlier, had it not been thwarted by Re-
publican House Members from the 21st Con-
gressional District of Texas and from the 4th
Congressional District of Kentucky who de-
prived the bill of the unanimous consent need-
ed for passage.
This robust disaster package includes $17.2
billion in long overdue emergency spending for
disaster-stricken communities across our na-
tion and territories.
It builds on the legislation that passed the
House in January—including an additional $3
billion to address the urgent needs of those
living in the Midwest (Nebraska, Missouri,
South Dakota, Iowa and Kansas) and South
(Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia and
the Carolinas) who have been devastated by
flooding and tornadoes in recent months.
This bill also provides some additional dis-
aster assistance to communities continuing to
recover from Hurricane Harvey.
House Democrats are standing up and act-
ing to help communities across the United
States and in Puerto Rico, Texas, the North-
ern Mariana Islands, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Is-
lands and American Samoa recover and heal
from devastating disasters—these commu-
nities should not be held hostage because of
this administration’s benign neglect toward
Puerto Rico.
Senate Republicans should come to their
senses and join Democrats in advancing this
bill and speeding relief to millions of Ameri-
cans.
Included in this legislation is critical funding
for:
Infrastructure and community development
to rebuild our transportation systems and re-
pair housing, businesses and public infrastruc-
ture;
Farmers and rural communities to bolster
the farmer safety net and restore disaster-
damaged lands;
Social services, mental health, education
and dislocated worker initiatives to invest in
the well-being of children, workers and fami-
lies in disaster-struck areas—including pro-
viding critical nutrition and Medicaid assist-
ance for Puerto Rico and U.S. territories;
DOD and Veterans Affairs to repair and re-
build hurricane-damaged bases and facilities;
and
Disaster resiliency to mitigate damage and
costs from future disasters which are becom-
ing more frequent as a result of climate
change.
American families hit by natural disasters
deserve to know that (their government will
stand with them throughout the road to recov-
ery.
Democrats are committed to delivering this
assistance to our fellow Americans as they
work to rebuild their lives and their commu-
nities.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2157, the ‘‘Supplemental
Appropriations Act of 2019,’’ provides much
needed and long overdue relief to Americans
in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and
Texans who are still suffering from the rav-
ages of Hurricanes Maria, Irma, and Harvey
as well as provide relief to victims of Hurricane
Michael which struck Alabama, Florida, and
Georgia in October 2018 and to the victims of
the Midwestern floods.
Hurricane Harvey ranks as the second-most
costly hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland since
1900, causing more than $125 billion in dam-
age.
Our residents need more money for single-
family home repairs, whether it is disaster re-
covery or general housing dollars and I will
continue to strive on behalf of the neighbor-
hoods and on behalf of hard-working home-
owners who deserve these funds, so they can
continue on with their lives and return to their
homes.
Victims of natural disasters are entitled to
know who to contact when issues related to
FEMA arise and to be assured that their ques-
tions are answered, and complaints ad-
dressed.
Allocating funding for measures such as
Electricity Delivery for necessary expenses re-
lated to the consequences of Hurricanes Har-
vey, Maria, Irma, and Super Typhoon Yutu, is
vital to negate the effects of these catastrophic
events from significantly worsening.
Hospitals, first-responders, and a number of
other vital institutions that help our commu-
nities recover from the after-effects of natural
disasters need access to electricity.
Moreover, with the severity of natural disas-
ters and the ranging of their locations, we
must be proactive in our preparation for recov-
ery.
Alternatively, water is the most essential re-
source known to man.
A human can go for more than three weeks
without food—Mahatma Gandhi survived 21
days of complete starvation—but water is a
different story.
At least 60 percent of the adult body is
made of it and every living cell in the body
needs it to keep functioning.
Under extreme conditions an adult can lose
1 to 1.5 liters of sweat per hour and if that lost
water is not replaced, the total volume of body
fluid can fall quickly and, most dangerously,
blood volume may drop.

We do not have the luxury of ignoring hurri-

With these events it is not a question of ‘‘if’’,
but ‘‘when.’’
For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to

EXTENDING TEMPORARY ASSIST-
ANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES
PROGRAM AND RELATED PRO-
GRAMS
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules
and pass the bill (H.R. 2940) to extend
the program of block grants to States
for temporary assistance for needy
families and related programs through
September 30, 2019.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 2940
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF THE TEMPORARY AS-
SISTANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES
PROGRAM AND RELATED PRO-
GRAMS THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30,
2019.
Activities authorized by part A of title IV
and section 1108(b) of the Social Security Act
shall continue through September 30, 2019, in
the manner authorized for fiscal year 2018,
and out of any money in the Treasury of the
United States not otherwise appropriated,
there are hereby appropriated such sums as
may be necessary for such purpose.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Il-
linois (Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS) and the
gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs.
WALORSKI) each will control 20 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Illinois.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that
all Members may have 5 legislative
days in which to revise and extend
their remarks and include extraneous
material on the bill under consider-
ation.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois?
There was no objection.
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2940 is bipartisan
legislation that extends the Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families pro-
gram, TANF, and the Child Care Enti-
tlement to States, CCES, through Sep-
tember 30, 2019. This legislation will
allow the Department of Health and
Human Services to make on-time pay-
ments to States, Tribes, and territories
for the fourth quarter of the fiscal
year.
I thank my friend and ranking mem-
ber, Mrs. WALORSKI, for her support of
parents and grandparents and for
partnering with me to ensure that
there is no disruption in help for fami-
lies or promised funding to States.
States depend on Federal TANF and
childcare funding to help struggling
parents and grandparents work and to
provide basic necessities for children.
Without the funding we are extending
today, States would likely reduce ac-
cess to childcare assistance, transpor-
tation, and job training, and delay or
reduce assistance families use to buy
basics like food, housing, and diapers.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD
this letter from the bipartisan leader-
ship of the National Governors Asso-
ciation urging Congress to quickly
enact H.R. 2940.
NATIONAL GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION,
Washington, DC, May 30, 2019.
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL,
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,
Washington, DC.
Hon. CHUCK SCHUMER,
Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,
Washington, DC.
Hon. NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY,
Minority Leader, House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL, MI-
NORITY LEADER SCHUMER, SPEAKER PELOSI,
AND MINORITY LEADER MCCARTHY:
We write to urge you to support and pass
H.R. 2940, introduced by Chairman Davis and
Ranking Member Walorski of the House
Ways and Means Subcommittee on Worker
and Family Support, which would extend the
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families
(TANF) program through September 30, 2019.
As you know, the program funding is cur-
rently slated to expire on June 30, 2019.
TANF is a critical program for states and
served 3.1 million recipients, including 1.2
million families in 2018. TANF provides vital
cash assistance, job training, child care, and
other critical services for families and chil-
dren. The program provided a total of $16.5
billion in 2018 in federal dollars for these
services for the 50 states, the District of Co-
lumbia, the territories, and American Indian
tribes. States also are required to contribute
at least $10.3 billion in state funds per year
under the maintenance-of-effort require-
ment.
We ask that Congress act quickly and pass
H.R. 2940, a clean TANF extension, and send
it to the President for signature in order to
avoid any lapse in funding for states and to
mitigate any adverse impacts to American
families. While continued short-term exten-
sions make it challenging for states to allo-
cate resources strategically, we look forward
to working with you on a long-term reau-
thorization bill in the near future.
Sincerely,
GOVERNOR KATE BROWN,
Chair, National Gov-
ernors Association,
Health and Human
Services Committee.
GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER,
Vice Chair, National
Governors Associa-
tion, Health and
Human Services
Committee.
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, in my home State of Illinois,
we use more than half of TANF dollars
to provide childcare to working parents
and grandparents, and almost a fourth
of it is for child welfare services to re-
duce child abuse and neglect. If the
Federal Government fails to make
TANF and CCES payments on time, it
will affect our State budget, but it will
also harm the most vulnerable fami-
lies.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 2940, to extend the Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families, or
TANF, program for another 3 months,
because families who use these critical
benefits should not be penalized for the
failures here in Washington.
We are here for the 39th extension of
TANF because we are once again un-
able to move a longer term extension
or a reauthorization of this program.
I certainly hope Democratic leaders
in the House will allow Chairman
DAVIS and me to work with our col-
leagues on the Ways and Means Com-
mittee in a bipartisan manner to de-
velop a long-term TANF reauthoriza-
tion that ensures this program focuses
on helping individuals prepare for, find,
and keep good jobs.
At a time when we have 7.5 million
job openings and growing demand for
workers that is driving wages up, we
not only want every person to reach
their full potential—we need them to.
We have the opportunity to make
economic and social gains in ways not
seen in decades so families are better
off financially, helping to improve
their overall well-being in the near and
long term.
Better wages and stable work bring
along a whole host of benefits, most
importantly, the positive impact on
children who are spared the trauma
that comes from unrest in the home.
At the root of addressing these chal-
lenges needs to be a focus on human
interaction, engagement, support, en-
couragement, and belief in the pos-
sible, not just assumptions about the
probable.
It is time to focus on solving the root
causes rather than pushing complex
government ideas that will only ad-
dress the symptoms.
That is why I, along with more than
50 of my colleagues, have come forth
with a full reauthorization of the
TANF program. Our bill, called the
JOBS for Success Act, would return
the program’s focus to families by:

Expecting universal case manage-
ment so we can rebuild the human con-
nection and so no one is ignored or left
behind in this process;
Holding States accountable for work
outcomes, meaning folks can get and
keep a job, and ensuring that dollars go
to their families;
Prioritizing households below 200 per-
cent of the poverty line so they get the
services they need to be successful;
Using funds to support and encourage
work over the long term, because we
know life is hard, not just when some-
one is starting a job, but 6 months into
the job when the car breaks down or
one of life’s many challenges happens;
and
Increasing resources available to sup-
port childcare to more than $14 billion
annually, better utilizing existing
funds, and allowing up to half of a
State’s annual allocation to be used for
childcare.
We all want families to succeed and
to achieve their American Dream. The
first step on that bridge out of poverty
is getting a job, keeping a job, and
moving through the ranks to higher
pay and more benefits.

Unfortunately, under Democratic
leadership, we have yet to see any pro-
posals to reform or improve this pro-
gram. And today, we are moving to the
floor without any formal consideration
by the committee or hearings on this
bill.
Instead of reaching across the aisle
to get things done for the American
people, Democratic leadership is fo-
cused on investigating the President
and going after his tax returns. They
are proposing new entitlements that
tax low-income workers and subsidize
large corporations. They are passing
bills that claim to protect people with
preexisting conditions but, in reality,
take away their health insurance
choices. And they are continuing to
allow infanticide by refusing to bring
to the floor the Born-Alive Abortion
Survivors Protection Act.
Republicans want to work on bipar-
tisan changes to improve childcare
under TANF, and we have come for-
ward with a viable plan to improve sup-
port for families in need by nearly dou-
bling historic funding levels.
I know my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle have the same desire,
and I hope we can find common ground
before the next bill comes to the floor.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. JUDY
CHU).
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.
2940. The bill authorizes the Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families program
and the Child Care Entitlement to
States, which expire on June 30. These
are vital programs that help keep chil-
dren and families out of poverty.
TANF provides an important safety
net for families, and States use the
money to give very low-income fami-
lies with children direct cash assist-
ance, childcare, and work training.
In my home State of California,
TANF is critical to so many families.
Administered through the CalWORKs
program, California supplements its
Federal TANF programs with its own
State dollars to help lift individuals
out of poverty, and it is working.
In Los Angeles County, where my
district is located, an additional 71,000
children would be living in poverty and
31,700 children in deep poverty without
TANF. Altogether, that would be over
100,000 more children living in poverty.
California sees the value in TANF
and is supplementing its TANF dollars
with increased State investments for
cash assistance and restoration of cost-
of-living adjustments.
Reauthorization of Federal funds is
key in ensuring that there is progress
in reducing poverty, so I urge all my
colleagues to vote in support of H.R.
2940. We must ensure that funding for
families in need continues until the
end of this fiscal year.
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL).
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in support of H.R. 2940,
to extend the authorization for the
Temporary Assistance for Needy Fami-
lies program and the Child Care Enti-
tlements to States program through
the end of the 2019 fiscal year. This leg-
islation will ensure that families in my
district continue to have access to the
important financial and social support
offered by these programs.
We know that low-income workers
face significant hurdles to economic se-
curity. TANF is a critical tool for mak-
ing sure that these families can afford
basic necessities like food, housing,
and medicine. In fact, over 11,000 fami-
lies in Alabama currently receive as-
sistance from TANF, and more than
20,000 children benefit from this impor-
tant program.
This bill will make sure that TANF
recipients in Alabama receive the $23.25
million that is expected to be allocated
to the State in the coming months.
This legislation also extends the
Child Care Entitlement to States pro-
gram, an important tool as we fight to
make sure all parents can have access
to affordable, quality childcare.
Childcare is one of the largest expenses
facing families, and the matching
funds included in this program are im-
portant to support low-income workers
and their children.
I am pleased that this bill will
unlock $10.2 million of funding for
childcare in Alabama to help meet the
needs of children and families in my
district.
While I strongly support this bill, it
should be noted that no one thinks
that this short-term extension of these
programs is the perfect solution. But it
is critical that we maintain funding
and provide continuity for working
families and children who depend upon
TANF and childcare grant funding.
It is my hope that we will continue
to explore ideas to improve these pro-
grams, including increasing funding
levels for childcare support grants and
identifying ways that these programs
can more effectively help families in
need.
I ask my colleagues to join us in sup-
porting this short-term extension of
TANF and childcare entitlement pro-
grams, and I ask that they support this
bill going forward.
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE).
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, here we
are, yet again, to extend block grants
to States for the Temporary Assistance
to Needy Families Act through Sep-
tember 30, 2019, this time in the form of
H.R. 2940. I support that initiative.
However, with the reform of ‘‘welfare
as we knew it’’ pre-1996, instead of
helping people out of poverty, as the
narrative goes, we have created a per-
manent underclass of primarily women
workers who have been denied edu-
cation, denied training, and denied
childcare while being required to work
at below-subsistence levels or, worse,
forced to engage in work activities
with absolutely no compensation,
which is violative of the 13th Amend-
ment to the Constitution, which abol-
ished slavery and uncompensated work.
Mr. Speaker, our so-called welfare re-
form can more accurately be described
as ‘‘welfare deform,’’ given the flagrant
flaws that amount to government-sanc-
tioned child abuse—for example, the
requirement to work without guaran-
teed, safe, and affordable childcare, and
the imposition of time limits during
countercyclical episodes, like the one
we saw during the Great Recession.
Mr. Speaker, I have drafted a bill
called the RISE Out of Poverty Act
that would do more than just extend
TANF. It would reform it by stipu-
lating that reducing child poverty and
securing childcare while the parent is
at work would be the primary purpose
of TANF.
We would lift people out of poverty.
The block grants would be spent on
programs that would alleviate poverty,
not on projects like filling the holes in
a government’s budget.
While I urge my colleagues to sup-
port H.R. 2940, I also encourage us, Mr.
Speaker, to roll up our sleeves and get
to work and craft an overhaul of this
program that would fix the short-
comings that exist in the TANF pro-
gram we now have.
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I
yield the balance of my time to the
gentleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES),
and I ask unanimous consent that he
be allowed to control that time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4197
June 3, 2019
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Indiana?
There was no objection.
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from Florida
(Mr. DUNN).
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, today, this
Congress will finally finish its work on
a disaster supplemental. For my dis-
trict, this bill comes almost 8 months
after Hurricane Michael destroyed 12
counties in Florida.
For 8 months, I have hammered this
Congress about the devastation and
desperate needs in my communities.
Month after month, one political ex-
cuse after another has been used to
delay the emergency disaster supple-
mental, which had always been prompt
and never been politicized.
But not this time. This time, my
neighbors, my communities, and my
friends were left to wonder why Wash-
ington doesn’t care about them.
Whatever became of Americans help-
ing Americans?
To my colleagues who have unneces-
sarily delayed this bill, and who may
even today vote against it, I ask why.
Some colleagues will say their prin-
ciples required a recorded vote, even
though the content of this bill has been
known for months and debated for
months. In fact, we had a chance to
vote on the amendments to it just 2
weeks ago.
For those upset at the cost, okay,
spending in Washington is a problem.
But are they willing to make an empty
gesture about balancing the Federal
budget on the backs of Americans who
have lost everything? Are they willing
to force the airmen at Tyndall and the
marines at Camp Lejeune to halt work
to repair their bases because they ran
out of money over a month ago? How
about the foresters in the timber indus-
try who grow a commodity not covered
by Federal crop insurance or any other
program? Are they willing to bankrupt
them? A ‘‘no’’ vote today does exactly
that.
I would like to close with a simple
thought for those who would think
about voting ‘‘no’’ on this bill: There
but for the grace of God go I.
If this happened in their districts,
would they be willing and prepared to
vote against their neighbors in the face
of a disaster that literally destroyed
their homes and businesses? Would
they look them in the eye and vote
‘‘no’’? I rather doubt it.
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today as Congress
debates another extension of the Tem-
porary Assistance for Needy Families
program, or TANF.
While TANF remains a vital program
to millions of Americans, and I support
an extension, I am disappointed in my
colleagues across the aisle for not tak-
ing the opportunity to discuss much-
needed reforms to TANF, which are
long overdue. In fact, since the pro-
gram began in 1996, TANF has had only
one true reauthorization and has been
simply extended 38 times, including
four times in the last 2 years since I
have been in Congress.
Today, we debate another extension
until September 30. However, another
extension does not allow us to discuss
proposals to reform TANF to help
Americans get jobs needed for an inde-
pendent and prosperous life.
Unlike my colleagues, Republicans
have put forth such a proposal called
the JOBS for Success Act. The bill ex-
pands services to connect people re-
ceiving TANF with tailored skills
training and jobs. It also allows States
to fund apprenticeships and on-the-job
training programs, and it expands
funding for work-related transpor-
tation costs and childcare. In return,
the JOBS for Success Act strengthens
accountability for securing a job and
maintaining it.
These commonsense reforms are
needed now more than ever. Under our
new Tax Code, our booming economy
has more jobs than workers for the
first time in history: 7.5 million job
openings versus 5.8 million unem-
ployed, according to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. Now is the time for
people to get the support and training
they need to take part in this historic
economic recovery.
Reforming TANF in Congress should
be a great first step toward this goal. I
know this because I have seen how re-
forms to TANF can help those in need.
In my home State of Kansas, we al-
lowed TANF dollars to go to the JAG
program, which helps at-risk high
school students graduate and get a suc-
cessful career path. In Kansas, JAG has
a 91 percent graduation rate and 80 per-
cent employment rate, both above the
national average for JAG students.
This one statewide reform is an ex-
ample of the potential that exists if we
come together to look at potential na-
tional reforms to TANF and to help
families in need and give them the sup-
port they need.
b 1545
Unfortunately, it appears that my
colleagues across the aisle are okay
with simply kicking the TANF can
down the road for the 39th time with-
out discussing the JOBS for Success
Act or offering any sort of reform pro-
posal.
As we debate this extension bill, I
continue to call on my colleagues to
work with us on reforming TANF and
developing a full reauthorization bill,
not just continuing to kick the can
down the road.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of
my time.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the
ranking member, Representative
WALORSKI from Indiana, and all of my
colleagues who have supported and who
cosponsor and support this legislation.
Congress can and should do far more to
reduce child poverty and help hard-
working families to make ends meet.
For example, a recent study by the
National Academy of Sciences found
multiple paths to reducing child pov-
erty by 50 percent in just 10 years using
well-known evidence-based tools like
the earned income tax credit, the child
independent care tax credit, and the
Child Care and Development Fund.
Mr. Speaker, I hope to work with my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to
find new ways to support the parents
and grandparents who are working so
hard. But while we are looking for
ways to make sure that States and the
Federal Government do more, we
should certainly not allow a funding
lapse that would result in States hav-
ing to do less.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this simple, bipar-
tisan legislation to allow us to meet
our commitments to State govern-
ments and to families in need across
the country.
Mr. Speaker, I urge full support, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
support of H.R. 2940, which strengthens the
‘‘Temporary Assistance for Needy-Families’’
program.
Specifically, H.R. 2940 extends the author-
izations for the Temporary Assistance for
Needy Families program (TANF) and the Child
Care Entitlement to States (CCES) through
September 30, 2019.
The legislation passed by Congress to end
the Trump Shutdown authorizes the TANF
program through June 30, 2019.
H.R. 2940 is necessary to ensure that the
Department of Health and Human Services
has the authority to pay fourth quarter allot-
ments to states, tribes, and territories on time
and in full, preventing any interruption of bene-
fits to low-income parents and children.
TANF is administered by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services (HHS)
and features four program goals: provide as-
sistance to needy families so that children can
be cared for in their own homes; reduce the
dependency of needy parents by promoting
job preparation, work and marriage; prevent
and reduce unplanned pregnancies among 1
single young adults; and encourage the forma-
tion and maintenance of two-parent families.
Under TANF, the federal government gives
states a fixed block grant totaling $16.5 billion
each year.
This annual amount has not increased for
inflation over the past two decades-and now
covers only two-thirds of the purchasing power
when it was created.
TANF and SNAP are essential to provide
nutritional and financial assistance to the na-
tion’s neediest families and children.
Nearly half (48 percent) (3,375,666) of
Texan children live in low-income families
which is significantly higher than the national
level of 41 percent.
Texas needs to increase the amount of
funding for needy families to support their live-
lihoods and prosperity.
Many TANF families struggle with multiple
barriers to self-sufficiency, such as disabilities,
mental health issues, domestic violence and
substance use disorders.
As a result, these families may not always
be able to meet the full participation require-
ments.

States and counties should be given the
flexibility to provide partial credit to these fami-
lies with special needs.
TANF funding should be increased annually
by an amount commensurate with the rate of
inflation to ensure that the program’s actual
value does not decrease each year.
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families
(TANF) in Texas has supported 57,201 Tex-
ans in FY2018.
Texas has reported March 2019 TANF ex-
penditures of $3,371,717 for 18,195 cases.
According to the Center on Budget and Pol-
icy Priorities, Texas is listed as one of nine (9)
states that spend less than 10 percent of
TANF funds.
Another families program that falls under as-
sistance for needy is the Supplemental Nutri-
tion Assistance Program (SNAP), which pro-
vides nutritional assistance to children and
families.
Texas has spent $357,125,771 over the
span of 1,377,384 cases in April 2019.
As of April 2019, Houston has 1,557 SNAP
cases, which provides services to 3,168 peo-
ple, of which 252 are elderly and 1,461 are
children.
In total, SNAP has funded $350,743 in food
assistance as of April 2019 in Houston.
Long-term reauthorization and adequate
funding for this safety-net program are critical
for counties, which invest over $58 billion an-
nually in human services.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join
me in supporting H.R. 2940 to support the ex-
tension of these critical programs for our
needy families and children.

question is on the motion offered by

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Hawaii?
There was no objection.
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such
time as she may consume to the gen-
tlewoman from Washington (Ms.
DELBENE).
Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Speaker, a little
over 5 years ago, on March 22, 2014,
Washington State experienced one of
the worst natural disasters to date. In
a matter of seconds, a tragic landslide
near Oso killed 43 people, destroyed
over 40 homes, and severely damaged
public infrastructure and private prop-
erty.
That day forever changed the people
of Oso, Darrington, Arlington, and the
Stillaguamish and Sauk-Suiattle
Tribes. They are an inspiring commu-
nity who did everything possible and
came together to help their neighbors.
The Federal Government declared a
major disaster in the State of Wash-
ington and made sure that Federal re-
sources were available to supplement
State, Tribal, and local recovery ef-
forts. While the recovery was slow,
these agencies responded to calls for
aid when our communities needed
roads rebuilt, an extension to file
taxes, assistance to get kids to school,
or to find new housing.
Unfortunately, this type of event is
not unique to Oso or to Washington
State. Every State in the country faces
some amount of landslide risk, a risk
that has not been well identified or ad-
dressed when compared to earthquakes,
hurricanes, or floods.
Substantial work needs to be done to
gain a better understanding of land-
slides and their potential impacts in
order to reduce losses of life and prop-
erty.
According to the U.S. Geological Sur-
vey and National Research Council,
landslides result in an estimated 20 to
50 deaths and between $1 billion and $2
billion of damage each year.
There is no one collective landslide
inventory for most counties, States, or
the entire country, and there isn’t an
agreed-upon methodology for creating
one. The establishment of a program
addressing landslide hazards as well as
increased funding for mapping, edu-
cation, and risk assessment is crucial
and could help save many lives, homes,
and infrastructure in the future.
We need to do more to ensure that we
fund programs and research efforts to
prevent future natural disasters from
becoming national tragedies. That is
why I introduced this bill, the National
Landslide Preparedness Act.
This legislation would establish a Na-
tional Landslide Hazards Reduction
Program through the U.S. Geological
Survey to better identify and under-
stand landslide risks, protect commu-
nities and property, improve emer-
gency preparedness, and, most impor-
tantly, save lives.
My bill would also direct the USGS
to implement a 3D Elevation Program

to update and coordinate the collection
of enhanced high-resolution elevation
data across the country. This is crucial
for numerous reasons:
To help communities plan for and re-
spond to natural hazards;
To update the Nation’s topographical
maps; and
To inform a myriad of uses, including
public safety, national security, plan-
ning, infrastructure, administration,
agriculture, and natural resource man-
agement.
Currently, much of the country still
relies on data collected more than 30
years ago using older technologies that
do not provide the same resolution and
benefits. It is time that landslide haz-
ards are addressed properly and in a
collaborative fashion. This legislation
will allow significant progress to be
made in landslide science and will
allow communities to be better pre-
pared for when landslides do occur.
We will never forget those who were
lost in the slide and the incredible
community that worked so hard to re-
build.
Five years ago at the Oso firehouse,
President Obama said that the Nation
was with the community every step of
the way in the rebuilding process. Part
of that process is making sure we do
everything in our power to make sure
that all communities have the nec-
essary information to be better pre-
pared for dangerous landslides.
Mr. Speaker, given the importance of
this issue to communities across the
country, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 1261, the National Landslide
Preparedness Act. This straightforward
piece of legislation will help prepare
and protect us from landslides.
Landslides are a dangerous and ex-
pensive national hazard. According to
the U.S. Geological Survey, landslides
cause as much as $2 billion in damages
each year and around 25 fatalities.
Wildfires, earthquakes, and severe
weather all make landslides more like-
ly. As cities and towns across our coun-
try continue to develop, the chances of
being affected by these events, like-
wise, increases.
Since the 1970s, one of the core mis-
sions of the U.S. Geological Survey has
been to use scientific data to minimize
the loss of life and property damage
from hazards like landslides. H.R. 1261
supports that goal by establishing the
National Landslide Hazards Reduction
Program, which will help identify and
understand landslide risk; and when
those hazards eventually occur, this
bill will help prepare us by improving
communication and emergency pre-
paredness.
H.R. 1261 also establishes a national
3D Elevation Program to create and
maintain standardized, publicly avail-
able 3D elevation data for the United
States. Not only will this program as-
sess landslide hazards, but could also
help identify energy, mineral, and
water resources, geological hazards
such as active faults, and other poten-
tial dangers, including swelling soils,
floodplains, and abandoned mine lands.
In Oklahoma, we have had lots of
floods, so if there are other things we
can do that will help get us some un-
derstanding of what is going on, people
will be better for it. I am confident
that this bill will help prepare for and
prevent against damage from land-
slides and, most importantly, save
American lives.
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the
measure, and I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my
colleagues to support this legislation,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.
1261, the ‘‘National Landslide Preparedness
Act.’’
H.R. 1261 establishes a national program to
identify and reduce losses from landslide haz-
ards and a national 3D Elevation Program.
The bill also authorizes a study of ground
subsidence.
Climate change charges us with the respon-
sibility to study significant landslide threats to
mitigate damages and protect our citizens.
The 3D Elevation Program (3DEP), author-
ized under H.R. 1261, systematically collects
3D elevation data in the form of light detection
and ranging (lidar) data for the conterminous
United States, Hawaii, and the U.S. territories,
with data acquired over an 8-year period.
Mr. Speaker, due to global warming, high
river levels provoke floods and landslides,
which block roads and hinder people from es-
caping life-threatening situations.
More than 30,000 people worldwide were
killed by landslides between 2004 and 2010,
according to the Geological Society of Amer-
ica.
And in the U.S. between 25 and 50 people
are killed by landslides every year, according
to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
Slides can occur in all 50 states, but regions
like the Appalachian Mountains, the Rocky
Mountains and the Pacific Coastal Ranges
have ‘‘severe landslide problems,’’ according
to the USGS.
Mother Nature is unpredictable and can en-
danger our constituents’ lives and homes if
advanced warning procedures are not estab-
lished.
Continued wet weather has also resulted in
rivers reaching increasingly dangerous levels.
As of 25 February, National Weather Serv-
ice data showed over 250 rivers in the Mid-
west, South and East to be above flood stage.
In February 2019, one person died in flash
flooding in Tennessee after a storm system
was caused by a landslide brought on by
record-breaking rain to the Nashville area.
The Cincinnati metropolitan area is another
region that faces constant threats of land-
slides.
It sits in part on what’s called the Kope
shale formation, which breaks down easily and
is highly prone to landslides.
In 2010, the Cincinnati metro area faced
landslides that wrecked properties and caused
damages that were difficult to assess.
Losses from landslides in the United States
were estimated in 1980 to exceed $1 billion
per year.
The U.S. Geological Survey estimated an-
nual losses to be between $2 billion and $4
billion per year.
However, landslide costs across the country
are not currently tracked or measured in a uni-
form way by any one agency.
Passage of H.R. 1261 will result in the:
publication of a national strategy for land-
slide hazards, risk reduction, and response in
the United States (including territories);
Development and maintenance of a publicly
accessible national landslide hazard and risk
inventory database;
an expanded early warning system for de-
bris flow; and
the establishment of emergency response
procedures for the rapid deployment of federal
scientists, equipment, and services to areas
impacted by a significant landslide event.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1261 incentivizes geo-
logic investigations, good engineering prac-
tices, and effective enforcement of land-use
management regulations to reduce landslide
hazards.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join
me in supporting H.R. 1261 to establish and
strengthen the nation’s emergency prepared-
ness procedures to assess and evaluate land-
slide damages and threats.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. CASE)
that the House suspend the rules and
pass the bill, H.R. 1261, as amended.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as
amended, was passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

relief to a small group of long-term
Northern Mariana Islands legal resi-
dents who will otherwise be forced to
leave the Commonwealth by June 29 of
this year if this legislation is not
passed.
This legislation is similar to legisla-
tion introduced back in 2011, which was
ultimately included in bipartisan, com-
prehensive immigration legislation
which passed the Senate in 2012 and to
legislation which has extended their
status previously.
Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as
he may consume to the gentleman
from the Northern Mariana Islands
(Mr. SABLAN), the sponsor of the bill.
Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding me time.
Mr. Speaker, 12 years ago, Congress
enacted legislation extending U.S. im-
migration law to my district, the
Northern Mariana Islands; and for my
11 years here in Congress, I have
worked to make the resulting transi-
tion as least difficult as possible.
Because there were unforeseen con-
sequences, there were people who fell
through the cracks. Today we have the
chance to help some of those people.
Their circumstances were not taken
into account when Federal immigra-
tion was extended to our islands.
b 1600
During the Obama administration,
they were granted humanitarian parole
that allowed them to stay. But Presi-
dent Trump decided that was an im-
proper use of parole.
The President’s executive order of
January 25, 2017, directed that parole
be granted only on a case-by-case basis
not to categories of people, as had been
done in the Marianas.
As a result, 1,039 long-term residents
of my island lost their parole status
last December. They were given until
June 29 to adjust status or leave.
I have no argument with the Presi-
dent’s thinking. In fact, I have worked
to provide permanent status in law for
these long-term residents. But immi-
gration legislation is difficult. I have
not been successful.
I hope today that will change because
even though the Trump administration
ended parole, at the same time, the ad-
ministration also recognized that these
long-term residents should be allowed
to stay in the Marianas. The adminis-
tration drafted legislation giving these

porting passage, which I include in the

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
HOMELAND SECURITY,
Washington, DC, February 21, 2019.
Hon. RAÚL M. GRIJALVA,
Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE GRIJALVA: This let-
ter sets forth Department of Homeland Secu-
rity (DHS) views with regard to H.R. 559, the
‘‘Northern Mariana Islands Long-Term Legal
Residents Relief Act.’’
Thank you for seeking the Department’s
input on this new legislation. We appreciate
the opportunity to review H.R. 559 as the
Committee begins the legislative process in
the 1st session of the 116th Congress.
As you are aware, H.R. 559 would provide
for the admission of certain aliens who are
currently present in the Commonwealth of
the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) and
who had been parolees as CNMI residents. In
doing so, the bill would establish an alter-
native regime to the now-terminated cat-
egorical parole program for the CNMI. DHS
believes that the bill would address the dis-
crete needs of this alien group in an equi-
table and lawful manner—more so than any
other bill that is now pending Congressional
consideration.
In light of the aforementioned, DHS sup-
ports H.R. 559. DHS would respectfully urge
the Committee to consider the bill favor-
ably. Further, it is the Department’s hope
that the full House of Representatives will
take up and pass the measure expeditiously.
The Department is pleased to inform you
that the Office of Management and Budget
has no objection to the presentation of this
letter to Congress. Nonetheless, I appreciate
your interest in the Administration’s con-
cerns on this matter. Fortunately, there are
none.
Again, thank you for the opportunity to
review and share the Department’s position
on H.R. 559. An identical letter has been sent
to Representatives Sablan and Bishop.
Respectfully,
CHRISTINE M. CICCONE,
Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs.
Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, let me
read from the administration’s letter.
‘‘H.R. 559 would provide for the admis-
sion of certain aliens who are currently
present in the Commonwealth of the
Northern Mariana Islands, CNMI, and
who had been parolees. . . . In doing so,
the bill would establish an alternative
regime to the now-terminated categor-
ical parole program for the CNMI. DHS
believes that the bill would address the
discrete needs of this alien group in an
equitable and lawful manner. . . . It is
the Department’s hope that the full
House of Representatives will take up
and pass the measure expeditiously.’’
Signed: Christine M. Ciccone, Assistant
Secretary for Legislative Affairs, De-
partment of Homeland Security.
To be completely transparent, the
bill before us has been altered slightly
from the original. The bill now in-
cludes an administrative appeal proce-
dure if an applicant believes an error
was made in processing their petition
for permanent status. But that new
language was also drafted, at my re-
quest, by the administration. So the
bill remains 100 percent as drafted by
the administration.
Again, the bill provides permanent
status in the Marianas only, with no
right of entry to any other part of the
United States and no right to any pub-
lic assistance, to a small group of peo-
ple who have lived and worked in the
Marianas, always lawfully present,
since before U.S. immigration law was
ever extended to our islands.
The Trump administration agrees.
These individuals should be allowed to
stay, but not by administrative fiat.
They should be allowed to stay under
the rule of law.
Today, I ask my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle to pass that law. Do
as the administration advises. Vote
‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 559.
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, as has been docu-
mented, the Commonwealth of the
Northern Mariana Islands’ workforce
has historically been comprised of U.S.
citizens as well as a nonimmigrant,
temporary foreign population.
Until 2009, the CNMI controlled its
own immigration policy for the foreign
workforce. Today, the Department of
Homeland Security manages the appli-
cations and eventual permits for any
foreign people entering the Common-
wealth for work. Since 2009, the transi-
tional worker program was forward-
looking, which left a certain portion of
the existing foreign workforce that has
resided and worked in the Common-
wealth for many years in a gray area.
H.R. 559 is an approach to resolve any
uncertainty for these long-term foreign
workers. I thank the Governor of the
Commonwealth, Ralph Torres, for his
help and Mr. SABLAN.
While the policy contained in this
measure is fair for long-term foreign
workers in the Mariana Islands, I am
deeply disappointed that the majority
did not consider this bill through reg-
ular order. Neither the Natural Re-
sources Committee nor the Judiciary
Committee, which received an addi-
tional referral of this bill, have acted
on this measure—no hearings, no
markups. It is my hope that the major-
ity truly believes in following their
rules that are supposed to provide for
an open and transparent process be-
cause this bill did not meet that test.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time.
I commend my colleague from the
Northern Mariana Islands for so ably
representing his people. As the Rep-
resentative proudly representing Ha-
waii, I recognize him and his constitu-
ents as members of our Pacific Islands
ohana, and I commend him also for
working very closely with the adminis-
tration to get this bill right from both
sides’ perspectives. It is a truly bipar-
tisan bill.
It is a necessary bill, and I urge my
colleagues to support the legislation.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. CASE)
that the House suspend the rules and
pass the bill, H.R. 559, as amended.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as
amended, was passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: I have the honor to
transmit herewith a scanned copy of a letter
received from Ms. Jessica Mathis, Director,
Bureau of Election Services and Notaries,
Department of State, Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, indicating that, according to
the preliminary results of the Special Elec-
tion held May 21, 2019, the Honorable Fred

Enclosure.
COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA,
DEPARTMENT OF STATE, BUREAU
OF ELECTION SERVICES AND NOTA-
RIES,
Harrisburg, PA, May 23, 2019.
Hon. CHERYL L. JOHNSON,
Clerk, House of Representatives,
The Capitol, Washington, DC.
DEAR MS. JOHNSON: This is to advise you
that the unofficial results of the Special
Election held on Tuesday, May 21, 2019, for
Representative in Congress from the 12th
Congressional District of Pennsylvania, show
that Fred Keller received 88,656 votes or
67.99% of the total number of votes cast for
that office.
It would appear from these unofficial re-
sults that Fred Keller was elected as Rep-
resentative in Congress from the 12th Con-
gressional District of Pennsylvania.
To the best of our knowledge and belief at
this time, there is no contest to this elec-
tion.
As soon as the official results are certified
to this office by all counties involved, an of-
ficial Certificate of Election will be prepared
for transmittal as required by law.
Sincerely,
JESSICA MATHIS,
Director.

SWEARING IN OF THE HONORABLE
FRED KELLER, OF PENNSYL-
VANIA, AS A MEMBER OF THE
HOUSE
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that the gentleman from
Pennsylvania, the Honorable FRED
KELLER, be permitted to take the oath
of office today.
His certificate of election has not ar-
rived, but there is no contest and no
question has been raised with regard to
his election.
The SPEAKER. Is there objection to
the request of the gentleman from
Pennsylvania?
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER. Will Representative-
elect KELLER and the members of the
Pennsylvania delegation present them-
selves in the well.
All Members will rise and the Rep-
resentative-elect will please raise his
right hand.
Mr. KELLER appeared at the bar of
the House and took the oath of office,
as follows:
Do you solemnly swear or affirm that you
will support and defend the Constitution of
the United States against all enemies, for-
eign and domestic; that you will bear true
faith and allegiance to the same; that you
take this obligation freely, without any
mental reservation or purpose of evasion;
and that you will well and faithfully dis-
charge the duties of the office on which you
are about to enter, so help you God.
The SPEAKER. Congratulations, you
are now a Member of the 116th Con-
gress.
f
WELCOMING THE HONORABLE
FRED KELLER TO THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES
The SPEAKER. Without objection,
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
MICHAEL F. DOYLE) is recognized for 1
minute.
There was no objection.
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, it is my pleas-
ure to welcome our new colleague rep-
resenting the 12th District of Pennsyl-
vania, FRED KELLER.
Mr. KELLER comes from Kreamer,
Pennsylvania. He comes to us from the
Pennsylvania House of Representa-
tives, where he served five terms.
Before his first election, Mr. KELLER
worked for 25 years in a factory pro-
ducing kitchen cabinets, working his
way up to manage the plant.
He also started his own real estate
business. His record of hard work and
commitment to public service will
surely serve this Chamber well.
I am looking forward to working
with you, Mr. KELLER; and on behalf of
the Pennsylvania delegation, I want to
welcome you to the House of Rep-
resentatives.
It now gives me great pleasure to
yield to the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. THOMPSON).
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, as a public servant,
FRED KELLER has built a reputation for
being hardworking, sincere, and dedi-
cated. He has worked passionately for
everything he has achieved.
Things weren’t always easy for FRED.
In fact, he grew up in a house where he
had no running water or electricity.
And he went straight from high school
to work in a factory and became the
manager of that great forest products
manufacturer. He then served honor-
ably for 8 years in the Pennsylvania
State House of Representatives.

H4206 June 3, 2019
FRED KELLER’s life is reflective of the
American Dream, and it is my privilege
to welcome him to the House of Rep-
resentatives today.
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I yield to our
newest colleague in the House of Rep-
resentatives, Congressman FRED KEL-
LER.
Mr. KELLER. Thank you, Madam
Speaker. Thank you, fellow Members of
Congress. Thank you to the folks of
Pennsylvania’s 12th Congressional Dis-
trict.
Before I begin, I just want to make
note of the gentleman whose position I
am replacing, and that is Congressman
Tom Marino, a dedicated public serv-
ant. We want to thank him for that
service, and also wish him and his fam-
ily all the best in the future.
I also would like to take a few mo-
ments to thank my family who are
here with me tonight, my grand-
daughter, Carson, standing next to me,
and up in the gallery, my wife, Kay, of
34 years, our daughter, Jamie, and her
husband, Ron, our son, Freddie, and
our other granddaughter, Camrie.
There are a lot of things that go into
public service, but having your family
and friends support you, it can’t be any
better than that.
I also would like to thank the out-
standing folks of Pennsylvania’s 12th
Congressional District who have placed
the privilege of representing them in
me here in Congress.
I also look forward to working with
all the Members of the United States
House of Representatives under Speak-
er PELOSI’s leadership. I also look for-
ward to working with the United
States Senate and our President to
positively impact the lives of all Amer-
icans.
Again, I thank you for this oppor-
tunity, and I look forward to working
with everybody.
May God bless you. May God bless
the United States of America.

MOMENT OF SILENCE REMEM-
BERING VICTIMS OF GUN VIO-

(Mrs. MCBATH asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1

Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I
rise on this first legislative day of June
to commemorate Gun Violence Aware-
ness Month and to remember the 12
lives that were tragically cut short in
Friday’s mass shooting in Virginia
Beach.
This month, we will be taking action
and bringing attention to common-
sense solutions to save the nearly 100
lives taken every day by tragic acts of
gun violence.
At this time, I ask my colleagues to
please join me in this moment of si-

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 962,
BORN-ALIVE ABORTION SUR-

Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that the Com-

from further consideration of H.R. 962,
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Pro-
tection Act, an act that protects living
babies who survive failed abortions,
and ask for its immediate consider-
ation in this House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been
cleared by the bipartisan floor and

Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Speaker, I
personally fought in the OB delivery
room for 30 years for the unborn and
newly born. I ask the Speaker to imme-
diately schedule this important bill so
we can protect these babies.

HONORING JENKINS HIGH SCHOOL
ROBOTICS TEAM
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the
Jenkins High School robotics team for
all of their accomplishments during
the 2019 season.
The Jenkins High School team, also
called Team WIRE, built from scratch
a robot that can pick up a large bouncy
ball, carry it across a room, and place
it in a specific location.
This year’s theme was space, and the
team had to design a robot that could
bring fuel to a spacecraft. In this case,
the fuel was the large bouncy ball.
Ranking 20th in the State of Georgia,
Team WIRE won the judge’s award at a
competition in Gainesville and ad-
vanced to a number of prestigious tour-
naments. I am proud that we have this
level of talent in the First Congres-
sional District of Georgia and thankful
that we have Jenkins High School,
which is doing so much to give their
students a STEM education and teach-
ing their students the value of team-
work.
I would like to congratulate Team
WIRE on its accomplishments this year
and wish good luck to Team WIRE in
the future.
f
GUN POLICIES WORK
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, in
the wake of yet another tragedy, I rise
to recognize the month of June as Na-
tional Gun Violence Awareness Month.
On Friday, yet another 12 people lost
their lives to gun violence, this time in
Virginia Beach. Twelve more families
were ripped apart, another community
forever changed.
I know firsthand the devastation a
gun can cause. The accidental shooting
that left me a quadriplegic was life-
shattering. And yet the pain of losing a
parent, a child, or a friend is forever
unimaginable.
I have said too many times to count
that we must address the gun violence
epidemic head-on. We owe it to the
family members, the friends, and the
neighbors who lost their lives in Vir-
ginia Beach and the thousands more
who will die this year.
We know the policies that work. Now
we must have the courage to enact
them.
f
RECOGNIZING PINE GROVE JROTC
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is
with great respect that I rise today to
recognize the JROTC cadets from Pine
Grove High School in Schuylkill Coun-
ty, Pennsylvania, and their com-
manding officer, Lieutenant Colonel
Michael Stefanchik.
These cadets are traveling overseas
to Normandy, France, to help mark the
75th anniversary of D-day and to honor
the beginning of the march to victory
in World War II.
In addition to participating in the D-
day memorial parade in Normandy,
they are taking part in the ceremonies
in Brittany and the American ceme-
tery at Omaha Beach. These hallowed
grounds are the resting place for thou-
sands of American heroes who gave the
ultimate sacrifice in defense of freedom
and liberty and to save the world from
tyranny.
2,014 Pennsylvanians stormed the
beaches of Normandy. It is a great
privilege to have these cadets from the
Ninth District present to honor and re-
member the bravery of countless ordi-
nary Americans who faced extraor-
dinary times.
I ask that my colleagues join me in
recognizing these cadets’ achievement
and remembering the great and lasting
sacrifices made at Normandy 75 years
ago.
f
WORKING TO IMPROVE THE LIVES
OF AMERICANS
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I was saddened to stand alongside Con-
gresswoman MCBATH to ask for a mo-
ment of silence for yet another inno-
cent group of Americans who died.
We must gather in this House and de-
mand the Senate to pass our legisla-
tion on gun safety, but we must also
stand together against making legal
access for anyone to have a silencer.
We just have to do better as relates to
the lives of Americans.
I stand, as well, to support the pas-
sage of the Supplemental Appropria-
tions Act, very important to those of
us in Texas.
As I watched this past week all of the
disasters that were happening, it was
sad. It was disappointing to know that
there were Members on the floor ob-
jecting to this bill.
In particular, Houston, Texas, im-
pacted by Hurricane Harvey, needed
this money for its water treatment, its
reimbursement, freshwater, and its
sewage treatment.
In addition, the people in the U.S.
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico terri-
tories are desperate for resources.
Many of us who visited know that they
are long overdue.
Finally, I am supporting the exten-
sion of TANF, the very important nu-
trition legislation that provides for our
children. It is expiring on June 30.
We have to do better. We cannot, in
essence, yield to people who believe
that these kinds of solutions should be
over.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4208 June 3, 2019
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize three schools that
recently finished excellent high school
baseball seasons.
First, I want to congratulate Lake-
land Christian, who capped off a 24-win
season by winning the Florida Class 3A
State championship on June 1. It was
no small feat to knock off a three-time
defending State champion, but under
the leadership of Coach Blane Fox,
they won 3 to 1. This was the first Polk
County team to win a baseball State
title in 24 years.
Second, it should come as no surprise
to those who know Florida baseball
that it was two Hillsborough County
schools, Plant City and Strawberry
Crest, that faced off in the Class 8A
championship on May 30.
Plant City, under the leadership of
Coach Michael Fryrear got off to a
quick start and never looked back,
winning 3 to 1 over Coach Eric
Beattie’s Strawberry Crest team and
finishing the season with 30 wins.
I congratulate Florida Class 3A State
champions, Lakeland Christian; Class
8A State champions, Plant City; and
Class 8A runner-up, Strawberry Crest.
Madam Speaker, all three teams
should be proud of their accomplish-
ments over this past season.
f
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE
ACTION
(Mr. LEVIN of California asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Gun
Violence Awareness Month, which
began mere days after another tragic
shooting in Virginia Beach and weeks
after the Chabad of Poway synagogue
shooting just outside of my district in
southern California.
This is wrong.
After the Poway shooting, I called
for concrete action to help end the
scourge of senseless gun violence in our
country. I called on the Senate to pass
H.R. 8, which would put commonsense
gun safety measures in place, requiring
a background check on every gun sale
or transfer. I also called on the Senate
to pass H.R. 1112 to close the Charles-
ton loophole, which currently allows
the sale of a firearm to proceed if a
background check is not completed
within 3 business days.
Months after the House passed those
bipartisan bills, they continue to lan-
guish in the Senate.
The American people deserve better.
The American people deserve a vote.
They deserve elected officials who
aren’t afraid of the NRA.
The American people deserve action.
That is what Gun Violence Awareness
Month is about. We have an epidemic
of gun violence that is unique to our
country, and we must finally do some-
thing about it.
RECOGNIZING WE BUILD THE
WALL
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the hard work
being done by a crowd-funded organiza-
tion called We Build the Wall.
Because Congress has failed to pass
legislation that will secure our border
and fund the construction of physical
barriers where they are needed, these
folks have taken the initiative.
We Build the Wall, led by Air Force
combat veteran and triple amputee
Brian Kolfage, has raised over $23 mil-
lion in private donations to help secure
the southern border and began con-
struction in New Mexico over the Me-
morial Day weekend.
Now, rumors were circulated about
the group, but they are fulfilling their
promise. After first being told their
permits were in order, the mayor of
Sunland Park and his administration
were flip-flopping, and their incom-
petence has threatened to put the
brakes on the whole project—but it
only delayed it 36 hours. They now
have been cleared to resume the con-
struction.
We know there is a crisis at the
southern border. Madam Speaker, I
thank Brian Kolfage and We Build the
Wall for their selfless commitment to
our great country.
It is too bad it has to come to this,
but it is also inspiring, in a way, that
citizens came forward to do the job of
the U.S. Government and secure our
sovereign border themselves.
This Congress should do better for
our border security and for our Amer-
ican citizens.
f
NOW IS THE TIME FOR ACTION
(Mr. CISNEROS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. CISNEROS. Madam Speaker, this
past Wednesday, I met with a group of
high school students from my district
who started a local March for Our
Lives chapter to talk about the gun
epidemic in our country. Then, 2 days
later, we had another mass shooting in
Virginia Beach.
According to the Mass Shooting
Tracker website, there have been over
181 mass shootings in the United States
this year, with over 200 victims losing
their lives.
I am proud that we finally passed
commonsense gun legislation in this
House that expanded background
checks, which is something over 90 per-
cent of the American people wanted,
but we need to do more.
The shooting in Virginia Beach used
both a silencer and a high-capacity
magazine. We need legislation now to
outlaw both of those items as well as
automatic rifles. We need to allow the
Centers for Disease Control to study
the gun epidemic in our country so we
can find a solution.
But it is not just mass shootings that
we need to address. Over two-thirds of
all gun deaths in the United States are
a result of suicides, and the number is
rising. Over 20 veterans a day are com-
mitting suicide. We must also study
firearm suicide and how it relates to
mental health and how we can limit
firearm access to those who are suf-
fering.
We have a problem in our country,
and it is not just going to go away.
Now is the time for action. Too many
lives are at stake.
f
HONORING MAUD BORUP
(Mr. HAGEDORN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. HAGEDORN. Madam Speaker,
the best gummy bears I have ever tast-
ed are made by a company right in
southern Minnesota.
Last week, I visited Le Center and
toured Maud Borup, a 112-year-old
wholesale confections company that
specializes in gourmet candy, baking
kits, food gifts, and more.
Maud Borup started as a woman-
owned brick-and-mortar candy shop in
St. Paul before women even had the
right to vote. Today it is a wholesale
company continuing to offer opportuni-
ties for women. In fact, 96 percent of
the more than 100 employees are
women.
Maud Borup’s president, Christine
Lantinen, was recently named the 2019
Minnesota Small Business Person of
the Year. Christine is an Army vet and
an entrepreneur who is making a dif-
ference in her community.
We had the opportunity to discuss
regulatory issues, healthcare reform,
trade, and how Federal policies are af-
fecting small businesses in Minnesota.
Madam Speaker, I thank Christine
and everyone at Maud Borup for being
a valuable part of Minnesota.

HONORING CHARLES NORMAN

permission to address the House for 1

Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, this
week we recognize the 75th anniversary
of D-Day, and we recognize a Mainer
who helped to liberate France and then
Europe from Nazi control in World War
II during the invasion of Normandy.
Charles Norman Shay is a Penobscot
Tribal elder and a decorated veteran of
both World War II and the Korean war.
He has received the Bronze Star, the
Silver Star, and the Legion of Honor,
making him the first Native American
in Maine with that distinction.
Charles Norman Shay was drafted at

sion. When he landed at Omaha Beach

in the first wave, it was his first time
in combat. Armed with only his med-
ical supplies, Mr. Shay charged Omaha
Beach dozens of times, pulling strug-
gling soldiers from the sea, bandaging
wounds, making splints out of pieces of
wood, or comforting soldiers through
their final moments.
Mr. Shay makes a pilgrimage back to
Normandy every year to remember his
fellow soldiers, and at 94 years old, Mr.
Shay is returning for the 75th anniver-
sary of D-Day.
Mr. Shay is a hero to all Mainers, the

A TRAITOR TO LIBERTY
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, what
defines a traitor to America’s liberty?
The Justice Department defines a
traitor as a person, who owing alle-
giance to the United States, adheres to
their enemies.
President Trump’s 2016 campaign
manager, Paul Manafort, fits that defi-
nition: a traitor.
Manafort proudly sought out multi-
millions of dollars from the enemies of
liberty to promote the pro-Russian
anti-democratic ruler of Ukraine—
President Viktor Yanukovych.
Yanukovych took his direct orders
from Russian dictator Vladimir Putin
who personally directed Russia’s inter-
ference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential
election.
When Ukrainian people rose up to
take back their nation, Yanukovych,
after killing his own countrymen, fled
back to his master in Russia to hide
out, looting countless millions that he
stole from the Ukrainian people.
The real question for America is how
could a U.S. citizen sell out liberty for
dirty money from such dictators for
whom liberty means nothing.
Mr. Manafort, Trump’s campaign
manager, is no stranger to criminal en-
terprise.
Just weeks ago, news broke out that
Manafort got millions upon millions of
dollars, auctioning off high-level
Trump administration positions to a
Chicago banker named Stephen Calk.
Madam Speaker, it is a fair question
to ask: At what exact point in his sor-
did career did Manafort become a trai-
tor to liberty? And, more importantly,
who else is riding his traitorous coat-
tails?
f
HONORING WILLIAM BRODISH AND
HERBERT TERNER ON THE 75TH
ANNIVERSARY OF D-DAY
(Ms. SHERRILL asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker,
this week, we will commemorate the
75th anniversary of D-Day, and I rise to
honor two of our New Jersey residents
who participated in Operation Over-
lord.
William Brodish worked at Picatinny
Arsenal for 3 years. He joined the Army
and was assigned to the 27th Ordnance
Bomb Disposal Squad.
On the morning of June 6, Private
Brodish landed on Omaha Beach and
got to work removing projectiles and
rockets from the shoreline. He was
only 22-years-old when he died on the
beach as a German artillery projectile
exploded over his position.
Herbert Terner enlisted in the Army
in 1942, and on D-Day, he parachuted
into Normandy with the 101st Airborne.
As a radio specialist, he alerted
troops of landing positions, and he con-
tinued to fight after D-Day in the Bat-
tle of the Bulge, and, eventually,
helped to liberate prisoners from the
concentration camps.
I had the great honor of meeting
Herb, now 98 years old and a resident of
Montville, over Memorial Day week-
end.
Tonight, I honor William, Herbert,
and all the New Jersey residents who
put their lives on the line to defend de-
mocracy and free Europe from the
grasp of the Nazis and totalitarianism.

JOANNE REAGAN DANCE STUDIOS
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, Jo-
anne Reagan of Joanne Reagan Dance
Studios in Cold Spring, New Jersey,
celebrated her 50th year teaching dance
over the weekend. She started training
at only 8 years of age.
Joanne Reagan Dance Studios is
founded on belief in the philosophy and
mission to build character, discipline,
and responsibility through the creative
and performing arts.
They aim to give students the ammu-
nition and the armor they need to pur-
sue a professional career, if they desire
to do so, or in whatever endeavor they
choose to pursue in their lives.
Students are encouraged to aspire to-
wards their own personal goals in a
manner which celebrates the individual
and promotes self-esteem, and it also
promotes a positive body image.
I celebrate Joanne Reagan’s service
to our community and commend her
for passing on these invaluable life
skills to southern New Jersey’s youth.
Madam Speaker, we are really lucky
to have her.

HONORING THE SELFLESS HEROES
OF THE OKLAHOMA STORMS
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
HOULAHAN). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the
gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. KEVIN
HERN) is recognized for 60 minutes as
the designee of the minority leader.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma.
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that all Members may have 5 leg-
islative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the topic of this Spe-
cial Order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma?
There was no objection.
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma.
Madam Speaker, the last 2 weeks have
been brutal for much of America.
Storms, tornadoes, and floodwaters
have attacked our homes and our peo-
ple.
I spent last week across the First
District of Oklahoma, watching the
waters rise and the homes and liveli-
hoods of my community be destroyed.
It was heart-wrenching.
Every day, I saw more families forced
to evacuate, more homes take on
water, more sinkholes open up, and
roadways disappear under the flood.
This disaster has reached every corner
of my district and has permanently af-
fected countless families.
For some, a lifetime of building a
home was washed away in a matter of
days. There are priceless photos that
will never be recovered, neighborhoods
that will never be the same, families
who have lost everything.
We may have caught the attention of
the Nation for a few days while torna-
does tore up our country and storms
battered our homes, but now the water
subsides, and the cameras turn off, but
the damage remains. Our communities
will be forever changed.
In times of war, there is an enemy.
There is a target for our retribution.
When foreign armies attacked Pearl
Harbor, we had a swift response. There
was somewhere to go, someone to fight.
When your people are attacked by
nature, when it is flood waters destroy-
ing your home instead of armies, where
do you turn?
In times of disaster, it is easy to
shake your fist at God. It is natural to
be angry and to turn that anger on the
only being you think you can blame.
Instead, what I have seen in my com-
munity this week is faith, generosity,
and the genuine love and care for our
fellow man.
It is these moments of devastation
when true character shines through.
This is when heroes are made.
When everyone is running away from
a problem or dangerous situation, who
runs toward it?
Tonight, we are here to honor the
selfless heroes of the storms, the men
and women of our communities who
showed true leadership and courage
these last few weeks to keep our people
safe and protect our families.
I am proud of Oklahomans and how
they came together. I am humbled to
have personally heard their stories.
Along with my colleagues, we will
shine a light on the brave people whose
sacrifices will forever have an impact
on our districts.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. LATTA).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4210 June 3, 2019
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding and for
holding this Special Order tonight to
honor all these individuals that did so
much.
A lot of people probably watched last
week on the evening news and during
the day the tornadoes that struck
Ohio. And one, in particular, struck my
district in Mercer County in the city of
Celina. And a lot of folks, when I was
over there, said they didn’t have very
much time to react and seek shelter
because of how fast the storms came
on.
But I think it is really important to
thank these individuals that responded
immediately to what happened.
These are our first responders, our
police, our fire, our emergency man-
agement, our emergency services out
there. They are the ones that got out
there to help, and they were on the
front lines, right when it struck in the
evening, and they worked all night
long, all the next morning, and
straight through.
I was there a day and a half after the
tornadoes struck, and it is amazing to
see how the community came together.
But, again, at the same time, it was
the individuals on the ground that
made sure it happened.
So, again, I just really thank all of
those individuals, and also our elected
officials, for all that they did, and the
countless hours that they spent mak-
ing sure that the citizens of their city
of Celina and their county of Mercer
received the help that they needed.
I think it is also important, because
of the resilience of the people that
lived there—and out in the community,
looking at all the destroyed homes, the
damaged homes—but I think it is im-
portant, because one of the gentlemen
I talked with really had his priorities.
When he was bringing out all the
damage from his home, you know, he
had told me when they built their
house, and how long they had lived
there. But he said, you know what, we
got out with our lives.
And all the things that he said that
they were hauling out of the house—
and he just kind of pointed to it all, it
was across the entire front—he said it
was just stuff. And he had his prior-
ities, because the families were safe,
and they got out.
Unfortunately, we did have a fatal-
ity. A gentleman who was in his bed
sleeping had a car lifted up from two
doors down and it crashed and crushed
him in his bed.
So, you know, it is when we have
these tornadoes and we have these dis-
asters across the country, I think it is
important that we always remember to
thank those who are on the front lines,
day and night, 7 days a week, 24 hours
a day, making sure that we are safe
and have that protection.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for having the Special Order
this evening, for having the ability to
thank those who needed to be thanked
again and again and again for all that
they do for us.
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from Ohio.
Madam Speaker, anyone can run for
office. Anyone can have a title, but it
takes true leadership and true selfless-
ness to stand up in the heart of a dis-
aster and lead your community.
Oklahomans are blessed to have in-
credible leaders at every level of gov-
ernment.
Local officials in all of my districts,
cities, and counties worked sleepless
nights, through torrential rains, and
devastating tornadoes to keep our peo-
ple safe and informed.
Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum has been an
around-the-clock warrior for his city.
Truly, I don’t think he slept in the last
2 weeks. Along with Tulsa’s city
councilors, Phil Lakin, Kara Joy
McKee, Vanessa Hall-Harper, and
TAEMA Director Joe Kralicek, they
have had a constant presence with our
people, helping where they can, but
most importantly, keeping the Tulsa
community informed of where the
water was headed, when to evacuate,
and where to go.
Tulsa County Sheriff Vic Regalado,
Undersheriff George Brown, and Com-
missioners Stan Sallee, Karen Keith,
and Ron Peters have been vigilant in
monitoring the movement of the flood
waters and have had an active presence
in the hardest hit areas of the city.
Wagoner Mayor Albert Jones, Coweta
Police Chief Mike Bell, City Manager
Roger Kolman, Mayor Evette Morris,
EMS Director Heath Underwood, and
Sheriff Chris Elliott have likewise been
a constant source of strength for Wag-
oner County.
Sand Springs was especially hard hit
this past week, and Mayor Jim Spoon
has shown true leadership for his com-
munity.
Vice Mayor Patty Dixon, Councilors
Phil Nollan, Mike Burdge, Christine
Hammer, Beau Wilson, Brian Jackson,
and Police Chief Mike Carter have
proven to be an asset to their town and
their people throughout this disaster.
In Bixby, Mayor Brian Guthrie, City
Manager Jared Cottle, Vice Mayor
John Easton, Councilors Paul Blair,
Brad Girard, and Robin Decatur have
gone above and beyond to protect their
people.
Jenks Police Chief Cameron Arthur,
City Manager Christopher Shrout,
Mayor Robert Lee, Vice Mayor Kaye
Lynn, and Councilors Gary Isbell,
Craig Murray, Dr. Josh Wedmen,
Donna Ogez, and Cory Box.
Bartlesville Mayor Dale Copeland,
Vice Mayor Alan Gentges, Councilors
Paul Stuart, Jim Curd, Jr., Trevor Dor-
sey, and Police Chief Tracy Roles.
Washington County Commissioners
Mitch Antle, Mike Bouvier, and Mike
Dunlap, Emergency Management Di-
rector Kary Cox, and Sheriff Scott
Owen.
Collinsville Mayor Bud York.
Skiatook Fire Chief Jim Annas, City
Manager Dan Yancey, Mayor Roger
Upton, and Vice Mayor Herb Forbes.
Owasso Mayor Dr. Chris Kelley, City
Manager Warren Lehr, and Police Chief
Scott Chambless.
Catoosa City Manager John Blish and
Mayor Brenda Conley.
Okay Mayor Brad Matthews, and
Johnny Walker.
All of these local leaders have been a
godsend to their communities during
one of Oklahoma’s worst widespread
natural disasters in memory.
Thanks to all of these incredible peo-
ple that have shown leadership during
our time of crisis. Your service does
not go unnoticed.
During this storm, members of the
community decided to stand up and
lead, not because they worked for local
government, not because they were a
first responder, but because they knew
there was a need for leadership in their
neighborhood.
Today, I would like to tell the story
of one of those men.
Jeremy Herrington is from the Town
and Country neighborhood of Sand
Springs—one of the communities hard-
est hit by the floodwaters.
After doing his own study of the
floodplain maps, Jeremy realized the
danger to his neighborhood long before
the Army Corps of Engineers or local
officials. He took to social media to
warn his neighbors to evacuate, and
many of them did.
Through the Town and Country
Facebook page that Jeremy manages,
his neighborhood has been transformed
into a loving community working to-
gether to overcome the disaster.
Instead of turning on each other,
Jeremy’s neighbors have come together
to share with each other, support each
other, cry together, and give advice on
how to recover from the floods.
b 2000
Most of the Facebook group have
never met in real life, but the commu-
nity Jeremy helped create online has
bound them together like a family.
Now that the Town and County neigh-
borhood is returning home, they are
mourning together and beginning their
recovery process together.
Without the attentive work of Jer-
emy, his community wouldn’t have
been notified of the danger in time. I
am thankful for Jeremy’s work to keep
his neighbors informed. I am sure his
community is grateful for his dedica-
tion as well.
The most important thing we can do
to prepare for disaster is to commu-
nicate. In that regard, Oklahoma’s
First Congressional District was in the
most capable hands. The meteorolo-
gists and storm chasers in our media
market have been working around the
clock to keep people informed of the
weather, telling them where to go and
what to do in case of disaster.
Some of the hardworking team in-
cludes: Mike Collier, Brandon Wholey,
Kirsten Lang, Clint Boone, Dan
Threlkeld, Chris Nestman, Caroline
Brown, Katy Kramer, James Aydelott,
Michael Seger, Laura Mock, Brad Carl,

June 3, 2019
Megan McClellan, Stacia Knight, Mi-
chael Grogan, Alan Crone, Stephen
Nehrenz, and of course, Travis Meyer.
Without the thorough preparedness
of these teams, the Tulsa area would
have faced unimaginable devastation.
When the skies are clear and it is
smooth sailing, it is easy to overlook
the work that these people put in day
and night. But after the past 2 weeks,
it is undeniable the essential role they
have in our community.
My deepest thanks to our hard-
working meteorologists and brave
storm-chasing teams that have kept us
informed and safe. The work is not
over. The floodwaters have not dis-
appeared yet, and they are all still
working hard to keep our community
informed.
We had the worst floods in history
and lost no lives, which is a testament
to their communication.
Our law enforcement officers, like
many in our community, have worked
tirelessly to protect our people through
the storms. Some, like Captain Jason
Morrison and Sheriff Corporal Mike
Heisten, are volunteering their time on
dive teams to rescue missing persons
and people stranded in the floods.
Dealing with the quick-moving,
murky floodwaters is challenging, to
say the least. It is a scary task, but
these men answered the call to action
because they knew their community
needed them.
In a flood situation as dire as we had
in Oklahoma last week, whole towns
were being evacuated. Entire cities
were underwater. There were places
completely shut off from the rest of the
State because all the surrounding
roads were underwater.
In this kind of danger, who goes back
for those left behind? Who goes in to
find the victims of the storms? Captain
Morrison and Sheriff Corporal Heisten
did.
We can never fully comprehend the
danger that these disasters bring to
our homes until they are here. Captain
Morrison and Sheriff Corporal Heisten
did not hesitate to step into the path of
danger to keep their community safe,
and for that, I am eternally grateful.
The devastation of these floods ex-
tends well beyond the homes and lives
of the people of Oklahoma’s First Con-
gressional District. Countless busi-
nesses took on disastrous amounts of
water over the last few weeks. Many
businesses had to shutter completely,
and many will need extensive repairs
before they can reopen.
The River Spirit Casino Resort along
the Arkansas River is one of those
businesses. The resort has become a
key destination in Tulsa, and it was
forced to shut down during one of the
most profitable travel holidays of the
year, Memorial Day weekend.
Instead of leaving hundreds of em-
ployees out to dry, River Spirit contin-
ued to pay these employees during the
flood and will continue to pay these
employees until the resort is able to
open and resume operations, well into
July.
Likewise, HollyFrontier Tulsa Refin-
ery, located on the Arkansas River, has
chosen to continue paying employees
for the duration of their building’s clo-
sure. HollyFrontier is even helping dis-
placed employees pay for hotel rooms.
These companies are going above and
beyond to help their employees during
a time of crisis, and it deserves rec-
ognition.
I would be remiss to speak tonight on
all local heroes of the last few weeks
and not talk about a woman who has
worked tirelessly to keep Tulsa County
safe. County Commissioner Karen
Keith has been a perennial source of
strength not only for the people im-
pacted by the floods but also for the
local leaders and responders who have
been working to combat the flooding as
well.
Commissioner Keith is not one to
stay safe inside the emergency oper-
ations room and direct from inside. She
has been out on boats in the flood-
waters in the most devastated parts of
town every day. She has been out in
the community, rain or shine, working
across party lines to make sure every-
one was safe and accounted for.
She has been helping business owners
deal with the aftermath of flooded
storefronts and helping families navi-
gate disaster aid and evacuation proto-
cols.
When water released from the dam
was increasing and posing a further
threat to Tulsa County, she made sure
people in the impacted areas were
evacuated and cared for.
Disasters like this make or break a
person as a leader, and Commissioner
Keith has proven her ironclad dedica-
tion to the people of Tulsa County.
Even now, as the floodwaters begin to
subside, Commissioner Keith is still
working at all hours to help those who
have been forever affected by these
storms.
I am so thankful for Commissioner
Keith and the work she has done to
keep Tulsa County safe these last few
weeks.
Wagoner County is the largest coun-
ty in the First Congressional District.
There was a lot of ground to cover
there and a lot of coordination needed
for emergency response during the last
2 weeks.
Heath Underwood, the Wagoner
County director of emergency manage-
ment, was the man to coordinate it all.
When floodwaters came for his commu-
nity, he kept all the moving pieces of
disaster relief functioning and running
smoothly.
It has been a never-ending cycle of
rainfall, water release at the dam, and
extending floodwaters across Wagoner
County, but Heath weathered it all. He
coordinated rescue efforts for people
stranded in their homes and on high-
ways across the county. I am sure
those who were stranded are thankful
for his dedication.
Our local leaders have proven abso-
lutely dependable and honorable
throughout this entire disaster, and
Heath Underwood is right up there
with the best of them.
There are so many people who have
proven absolutely vital to our commu-
nity throughout this time of disaster. I
could not be more thankful for our
leaders or proud of our people than I
am after experiencing the trauma of
the last 2 weeks in my district.
In times of disaster, true colors will
show. While these tornadoes, storms,
and floods could have brought out the
worst in Oklahoma, it brought out the
very best and bound us together as a
community. The friendships forged in
the fire of absolute devastation will
outlast these floodwaters. They will be
stronger than the damage to our
homes.
Heroes were made in Oklahoma this
week, and I am glad to have this
chance to share their stories.
I thank my colleagues who joined me
tonight. It means a lot that my col-
leagues would join me in shedding a
light on the people who have been truly
remarkable in our districts back home.
The message to take away from all of
this is simple: Together, we are strong-
er. Together, we will get through this.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader is recognized.
REMEMBERING THAD COCHRAN
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is
with great sadness that last week we
learned of the death of our friend and
former colleague, Thad Cochran from
Mississippi.
In nearly 40 years in office, Thad
served with a fierceness and loyalty to
Mississippi matched only by his sense
of dignity and respect for his col-
leagues.
When his issues were on the line,
Senator Cochran fought for Mississippi
as hard as any Senator. He nurtured
Mississippi’s universities, schools,
farms, hospitals, ports, and fishing in-
dustry. He was a champion of the poor
and gave a voice to rural communities
by expanding assistance for southern
farmers. Perhaps it is fitting that he
was first bitten by the political bug in
his run for head cheerleader at Ole
Miss because throughout his career and
throughout his life, Thad never stopped
being a cheerleader for Mississippi.
One thing I will never forget was
Senator Cochran’s graciousness after
my State was hit by Hurricane Sandy.
He knew, from his experience after
Hurricane Katrina, just how dev-
astating the damage can be and how
difficult the recovery process can seem
in the aftermath of a disaster. At a
time when many of his colleagues who
always voted for their regions but op-
posed Sandy because it was New York,
Senator Cochran not only supported it
but even made sure his team was avail-
able to give us guidance. I will never
forget that. That is the kind of gen-
tleman and fair-minded individual he
was—something missing a lot around
here.
In many ways, Thad Cochran was a
model Senator. He understood this
body’s preference for cooperation, com-
promise, and congeniality almost intu-
itively. Even as the Senate has gone
further away from those values, Sen-
ator Cochran held them close. That is
just who he was. It made him a better
Senator and a better man. We will miss
him. I think all of us will. Our prayers
go out today to his wife, Kay, his chil-
dren, his loved ones, and his many
friends.
BACKGROUND CHECKS
Mr. President, on background checks,
last Friday, another horrible mass
shooting transformed a peaceful com-
munity in America into a place of trag-
edy. In Virginia Beach, a dozen people
were killed, several others critically
wounded, and thousands of Virginians
left to mourn and pick up the pieces.
Today we grieve with the people of
Virginia Beach, and we send our
thanks to the brave police men and
women who risked their lives to pro-
tect their neighbors. These tragedies
leave scars that never go away on com-
munity after community that has suf-
fered from it.
It has been less than a month since I
spoke on the Senate floor after a shoot-
ing. That is the tragedy. It is less than
1 month that I had to come to the floor
and speak on the tragedy of one shoot-
ing, and now we have another. The list
of national tragedies is already too
long. The names and places of mass

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3146 June 3, 2019
shootings and the victims of everyday
gun violence are already too many—far
too many to count.
So it is time, long past time to bring
a bill to improve gun safety to the
floor of the Senate. The House has al-
ready passed a bill to close loopholes in
our background check system. It is
common sense. It is bipartisan. More
than 90 percent of Americans support
closing these loopholes, including a
majority of Republicans and a majority
of gun owners. It is hard to defend the
desire of felons, spousal abusers, and
those adjudicated mentally ill to get
firearms. In fact, those who oppose this
kind of legislation don’t defend it.
They sort of slink away and hide figu-
ratively, if not literally, under their
desks on the Senate floor.
Why will Leader MCCONNELL not
allow background checks to get a vote
or even a debate in the Senate? Why
has Leader MCCONNELL added this bi-
partisan legislation, that has already
passed the House, to his legislative
graveyard?
For too long, the gun lobby has re-
flexively opposed any gun safety re-
forms—the most benign and common-
sense reforms like closing loopholes in
our background checks—and for too
long the Republican majority has
marched in lockstep with them against
the will of the American people and
against the safety of the American peo-
ple.
It is time for that to change. Leader
MCCONNELL should call a vote on uni-
versal background checks now. Nobody
pretends it will stop every shooting,
but if it could prevent even one more
from happening, it deserves our consid-
eration. Let’s not delay any longer.
Let’s not cower before the NRA. Let’s
do the right thing that 90 percent of
Americans want us to do.
ELECTION SECURITY
Mr. President, there is no principle
more essential to democracy than the
principle of free and fair elections. It is
the very wellspring of our democracy.
It is what the people at Bunker Hill,
the farmers, put down their plows and
took up muskets for—no taxation with-
out representation, voting. Over the
past 3 years, we have been reminded
again and again how that very sacred
wellspring of democracy, voting and
fair elections, were attacked by a for-
eign power.
Mr. Mueller’s press conference last
week was only the latest reminder of
the concerted campaign by Moscow to
influence our elections in 2016. It was
also a reminder of how much we have
yet to do to secure our elections in the
future. We included some—some only—
but some funding for election security
in last year’s budget, but we have been
blocked so far from providing much
needed additional support in this year’s
budget.
We have bipartisan legislation to
harden election infrastructure and
sanction any foreign power that tries
to interfere in our elections. That leg-
islation is ready to go, but, once again,
MITCH MCCONNELL, self-described Grim
Reaper, has refused to take it up—an-
other tombstone in his legislative
graveyard.
At the very least, the Senate should
be briefed by our intelligence and law
enforcement chiefs about the threat of
election interference in the 2020 elec-
tion so we can all be aware of the dan-
ger that FBI Director Wray already has
pointed out.
On that front, I have some positive
news. I have spoken to the Republican
leader about that request. He has as-
sured me we will have a briefing. We
are still trying to sort out the timing
of the briefing, but I urge that it take
place as soon as possible during this
work period so we can prepare new leg-
islation that will go into effect at least
a year before election day of 2020. By
no means does a briefing replace all the
other things we must do to protect our
elections. It is necessary but not near-
ly sufficient. I hope when people go to
this briefing, Members, Democrats and
Republicans, they will see the danger
and act.
How can we sit by? We are a great
power. To sit by with our arms folded,
while Russia or China or Iran or some
other country, North Korea, tries to
interfere in our elections—that is not
what a great power does. It protects
itself and its people, especially when it
comes to something so vital as elec-
tions.
I hope we have this briefing quickly.
I hope it reignites a desire on both
sides of the aisle to move legislation,
increase funding, and do what is nec-
essary to protect our democracy.
BORDER SECURITY
Mr. President, on the border, since
the outset, the Trump administration’s
policy at our southern border has been
chaotic, ineffective and, in many cases,
inhumane. One of the most fundamen-
tally misguided elements of the Trump
administration’s policy is how it has
approached the root causes of the mi-
gration because, while the President
complains loudly about the number of
refugees and migrants at our border,
his administration has made a few of
the root causes of this migration more
severe.
One of the principal ways we could
address the surge on migrants is by
helping improve conditions in their
own countries. Most of them are flee-
ing violence or a huge economic hard-
ship, so they feel it is better to travel
thousands of miles of dangers, maybe
in the hands of coyotes, than stay
home. By cracking down on gang vio-
lence and drug trafficking back in their
home countries, we could reduce the
flow of immigrants at our southern
border.
No one can understand—so con-
founded—why, in late March, the Presi-
dent announced he would be cutting off
security assistance to Central Amer-
ican countries to address these very
issues. The President cut his nose to
spite his face. He made the problem
worse by cutting off these dollars.
The administration has provided vir-
tually no information about the ration-
ale for these cuts—$450 million. It is a
completely self-inflicted wound to our
national security that makes the prob-
lem the President complains about
worse, not better. It is almost as if the
President is intentionally trying to add
fuel to the fire, to fabricate a crisis,
and to create, post hoc, a justification
for a baseless emergency declaration
he made months ago.
I don’t think many Americans would
say cutting funding to help Central
American countries stop migration is a
responsible policy, and that is why we
Democrats have proposed just the op-
posite. We propose to actually get at
the root cause of migration by allowing
asylum seekers to apply for asylum in
their home countries, not at our south-
ern border, by increasing the number of
judges to process the cases at the bor-
der, and by helping Central American
countries crack down on gang violence
in the city’s drug cartels. In fact, our
bill authorizes $1.5 billion in security
assistance to the Northern Triangle to
do just that, far and above what the ad-
ministration has just cut.
The policies the administration pur-
sues make no sense whatsoever. They
seem vindictive, they seem done at the
moment, and they seem totally not
thought through. We are proposing
policies that will address the real
issues here, and Democrats will push
for them in any legislation that deals
with border policy.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.

VIRGINIA BEACH SHOOTING
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, as
millions looked forward to an early
summer weekend, Virginia Beach, VA,
became the latest community where
lives were shattered by violence.
Twelve workers at the Virginia Beach
Municipal Center were shot and killed
when a lone gunman—a fellow em-
ployee—opened fire on Friday after-
noon. Some of the victims had worked
for the city for decades, one for just
under a year. All of them leave behind
a grieving community that must now
try to make sense of the senseless. And
several more of their colleagues were
injured.
As the community rallies behind
those in grief and shock, the Nation is
also learning about the selfless heroism
of the law enforcement officers who
bravely brought the violence to an end.
Four officers moved quickly through
the municipal building that housed 400
workers. They quickly located the

shooter, hemmed him in to prevent fur-
ther innocent casualties, and engaged
him in a firefight. Reportedly, one offi-
cer was actually shot but was spared
serious injury due to his bulletproof
vest.
Thanks to their bravery, about 45
minutes after the shooting began, the
suspect was in police custody.
Such stories of courage strike us as
remarkable. They inspire gratitude and
remind us of humanity’s best, just as
we are faced with its worst. They
should also be occasions to remember
just how many men and women across
America put on their uniforms every
day and report to work, knowing they
might be called on for heroism just
like this. Hundreds of thousands of po-
lice officers and other first responders
across our Nation protect and serve
every day.
I know that all of my colleagues join
me in prayer and solidarity for the vic-
tims of this evil violence, for their
families, and for all of the first re-
sponders who stand ready to jump be-
tween their neighbors and harm’s way.
REMEMBERING THAD COCHRAN
Mr. President, on Thursday morning,
we received sad news out of Oxford,
MS. Our friend and distinguished
former colleague, Senator Thad Coch-
ran, had passed away.
Thad took retirement a little more
than a year ago to focus on his health
and his family. That day concluded a
truly remarkable career in the history
of the Senate: seven terms; nearly four
decades; the second longest serving
Senator from Mississippi; and the
tenth longest serving Senator, period,
in American history.
To put it all another way, when Sen-
ator Cochran first arrived in 1978, only
one of our current colleagues was here
to witness it. The other 99 of us are all
newer at this club than Thad was.
Such a storied career was far from
guaranteed when Thad decided to give
politics a try back in the early 1970s. I
have always enjoyed the story about
his very first run for Congress.
Remember, Mississippi had only had
one other Republican Congressman
since Reconstruction. So when this
young rising-star lawyer asked Rose
how she might like being married to a
Congressman, here was her response: ‘‘I
don’t know, which one?’’
If Thad’s presence here in Congress
at one point seemed improbable, it
quickly became difficult to imagine
Capitol Hill without him. His fruitful
career produced a huge number of leg-
islative accomplishments and a ster-
ling reputation as a thoughtful, meas-
ured, and effective leader. He chaired
the Appropriations Committee, the Ag-
riculture Committee, and the Repub-
lican conference. He was at once a pow-
erful force within our ranks and a
trusted friend and partner to many of
our friends across the aisle as well.
In just the past few days, the authors
of eulogies and tributes have enjoyed
noting all the ways that Thad seemed
to embody a whole region and era, as
though he had come right out of cen-
tral casting. One obituary talked up
the ‘‘traditional catfish fries,’’ ‘‘home-
spun politics,’’ and ‘‘Southern charm.’’
Another newspaper described his
‘‘Southern gentility’’ as a ‘‘courtly’’
and ‘‘understated style,’’ seeming to
suggest that approach was at odds with
his impressive and powerful perch.
It is true that over seven terms in
this body, Chairman Cochran appeared
on ‘‘Meet the Press’’ only twice. To say
he did not crave a national spotlight
would certainly be an understatement.
He was just too busy racking up
progress for the people of Mississippi
and for the country—busy managing
the appropriations process; busy find-
ing new ways to elevate historically
Black colleges and universities with
scholarship opportunities, research
grant funding, and new initiatives;
busy working across the aisle on mat-
ters of national security, like the bi-
partisan Cochran-Inouye National Mis-
sile Defense Act; busy using his voice
to champion the concerns of farmers
and rural communities, clearing obsta-
cles on commodity pricing and wet-
lands conservation.
Thad was so confident in American
agriculture that he used it as a tool for
international development. Now over-
seas farm delegations learn U.S. tech-
niques firsthand through the Cochran
Fellowship Program.
As much as the long list of achieve-
ments continued to grow, Thad Coch-
ran’s character and his values stayed
steady. Thad may not have followed his
schoolteacher parents into the edu-
cation business, but he sure did take us
all to school. His colleagues learned
firsthand that a dogged work ethic and
compassionate friendship are not in-
compatible here. His constituents
learned that their ‘‘quiet persuader’’
kept his promises. And the Nation
learned from a first-rate example of
humility and grace in public service.
So while we mourn that we no longer
have our friend Thad in this life, we
should also celebrate all of those les-
sons he taught us and celebrate the
fact that they aren’t going anywhere.
On Thad’s last day in the Senate, he
left us with a remarkable farewell
statement. In it, he noted that John
Stennis, another long-tenured Mis-
sissippian, had previously used Thad’s
desk and had signed it, per Senate cus-
tom. But while Senator Stennis had
noted his start date in 1947, he never
wrote down any end date on the other
side of the dash. ‘‘Perhaps there is
symbolism there,’’ Thad wrote in his
farewell, ‘‘that our service does not end
when we depart this Chamber.’’
Isn’t that the truth? When it comes
to Thad Cochran, his legacy and his ex-
ample are part of this place for good.
His impact continues. His service still
inspires all of us.
I want to close with a reference to
one more part of Thad’s farewell. Here
are his very last words in the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD, the capstone to 45
years of statesmanship. This is what he
said:
I will now return to my beloved Mississippi
and my family and my friends there. I will
miss this stately Chamber and this city. I
will not miss the power or politics. I will
miss people: you, my colleagues. . . . I trust,
if your travels bring you to Oxford, MS, you
will not hesitate to visit and join me for a
refreshment on the porch. We can listen to
the mockingbirds together.
That was our colleague—gracious,
generous, always with his home State
and his fellow Mississippians at the top
of his mind and deep in his heart.
Today, at the State capitol in Jack-
son, Mississippians gathered to return
the favor. Thad Cochran is at the top of
their minds. He is deep in their hearts,
and, most importantly, our friend is on
his way to a just reward in his Father’s
house.
So the Senate today sends our condo-
lences and our prayers to Thad’s wife
Kay; his two children, Clayton and
Kate; his grandchildren; and many,
many friends. We stand together in re-
membering our good friend.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas.
OPIOID EPIDEMIC
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, during
the last week, I spent some time trav-
eling through Texas, meeting with con-
stituents, and talking about some of
the legislation we have been working
on here in Washington and, perhaps
most importantly, spent a little time
listening to what was on their minds.
One of the things we talked about
was the fact that in 2017, more than
70,000 Americans died of drug
overdoses. That is according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention. The opioid epidemic, which
contributed mightily to that number,
has affected every State, every city,
and every community. My constitu-
ents, like all of our constituents, are in
search of real solutions to try to sup-
port those leading the fight on the
ground.
I had the chance to spend a little bit
of time in Tyler, TX, which is in East
Texas, which we affectionately call
‘‘behind the Pine Curtain.’’ I learned
from some of the folks in Tyler about
how substance abuse has affected that
area and what we can do better to
serve the people who are impacted. I
heard from pharmacists, healthcare
providers, law enforcements officers,
community leaders, and other experts
about their efforts. We talked about
the need for a holistic approach that
focused on reducing supply and also re-
ducing demand, helping those with sub-
stance abuse problems, and preventing
drug abuse from occurring and spread-
ing into the future.
We talked about some of the legisla-
tion we have passed here in Congress to
try to help equip them with the tools
they would need in order to fight this
fight—a bill we call the SUPPORT for
Patients and Communities Act. This
legislation provides critical tools to
those communities in the fight against
substance abuse. It reauthorizes pro-
grams to reduce demand for narcotics
and provides tools for pharmacists, pre-
scribers, and law enforcement so that

they can work together more
seamlessly to combat opioid addiction.
It also provides support for those re-
covering from substance abuse dis-
orders by providing expanded treat-
ment options and recovery services. It
takes unprecedented steps to combat
the opioid crisis, and it received over-
whelming bipartisan support in both
Chambers.
Now, I don’t blame people who may
listen to this and say: Well, I never
heard about that before. That is what
happens when we pass overwhelmingly
bipartisan legislation here in Congress.
If there is not a big fight about it, if it
is not on the cable news, if it is not on
social media, then it happens without
people paying much notice. Yet it is
important work that happens every
day here in Washington, DC—Repub-
licans and Democrats working to-
gether, trying to solve problems, try-
ing to equip those on the frontlines
with the tools they need in order to
fight that fight.
Folks in East Texas told me about
how the new grants under the SUP-
PORT for Patients and Communities
Act may help to strengthen their ef-
forts and help ease the pain of the
opioid epidemic.
Then I took a trip over to Lufkin
High School in Lufkin, TX, which is
also in East Texas, to meet with stu-
dents, educators, and administrators to
talk about the GEAR UP program. This
is a competitive grant program that
helps historically underrepresented
students to achieve college and career
readiness through academic, social,
and planning support.
For example, if you come from a fam-
ily in which no one has previously gone
to college, well, you may not really
know what it is you need to do, start-
ing even in the seventh grade, to begin
to prepare—what courses you need to
take, what prerequisites are going to
be required for you to be considered by
the college of your choice. If you de-
cide to take a career path that doesn’t
involve a 4-year college—through one
of our community colleges—and get a
certificate so you can qualify for a
good-paying job, let’s say, as a certified
welder, you need to prepare early.
The folks in East Texas told me how
these grants under the GEAR UP pro-
gram help one to do exactly that. The
GEAR UP program recognizes that col-
lege and career readiness begin early.
That is why it is so important that the
cohort that is first helped by these
GEAR UP grants is of those in the sev-
enth grade—pretty early. I don’t re-
member having a plan in the seventh
grade, to be sure. If I had had a plan, I
am not sure exactly what it would have
been. I came from a family in which
going to college was expected. As a
matter of fact, I never entertained any
other idea. Yet we have to recognize
that many young students don’t have
that sort of example in their own
households and that they need some
additional help in order to pursue their
educations and prepare for good, well-
paying jobs.
The good thing about the GEAR UP
program is that it doesn’t use a blan-
ket approach to support students be-
cause we know what works well in one
State and in one region of the country
may not work as well in another. In-
stead, the GEAR UP program gives
local leaders the flexibility to cater to
their students’ needs.
The best part about GEAR UP is that
it is actually a government program
that works. GEAR UP students grad-
uate from high school at a higher rate
than their peers, regardless of eth-
nicity or income, and they attend col-
lege at a higher rate.
In Lufkin, 3,000 students have bene-
fited from more than $10 million in
Federal GEAR UP grants over the last
two decades, and last week, I had the
opportunity to hear what it meant to
them personally. Statewide, Texas stu-
dents have benefited from $885 million
in GEAR UP grants over the last 20
years, and we have seen incredible re-
sults.
I believe there are additional steps
we can take to ensure that local lead-
ers have the flexibility they need in
order to tailor their programs appro-
priately, so earlier this year, I intro-
duced the GEAR UP for Success Act,
which will provide more flexibility to
school districts on how they may use
those funds so that local jurisdictions
can better tailor these programs to
their students’ specific needs. It would
reduce the local cost share signifi-
cantly—by half—that is required to re-
ceive a GEAR UP grant, which means
more students will benefit from these
funds and these programs.
I appreciate the folks in Tyler, in
Lufkin, and in the many other cities I
visited in Texas last week for taking
the time to share with me their
thoughts and ideas so that we can
bring more Texas common sense to
Washington, DC.
BORDER SECURITY
Mr. President, on another matter, we
know that Central American migrants
continue to make their way to our
southern border in record numbers and
that law enforcement, city officials,
and nongovernmental organizations
are struggling to manage this influx of
humanity. We are seeing people arrive
en masse, and it is not uncommon to
see multiple groups, each with hun-
dreds of people, arrive in a single day.
My State has 1,200 miles of a common
border with Mexico, and I believe that
border security is one of the Federal
Government’s most important respon-
sibilities. These are people who are
showing up at our border and literally
turning themselves in to the Border
Patrol because they know that by ex-
ploiting gaps in our asylum laws, they
are virtually guaranteed entry into the
United States. As well, the human
smugglers who get rich by smuggling
this human cargo from Central Amer-
ica, across Mexico, and into the United
States are making untold millions of
dollars in this very profitable business.
Last week, one of the large groups
who came to El Paso broke a record.
The Border Patrol encountered a group
of more than 1,000 illegal immigrants—
more than double the previous record
of 421 that was set last month. Only 39
of the people who were traveling in
that group were single adults. The rest
were either families or children who
were traveling alone, and that was no
mistake. The smugglers know that if
they send unaccompanied children or
families, they can exploit those vulner-
abilities in our immigration and asy-
lum laws and successfully place those
individuals in the United States, only
to be told to show up at later dates for
court hearings that are maybe months
or even years into the future. Surprise,
surprise—most do not show up, and
they successfully make their way into
the United States without complying
with our immigration laws. We simply
don’t have the facilities, the funding,
or the resources to detain and properly
care for many of these individuals, let
alone these children and families.
Regardless of where each individual
Member of Congress stands on immi-
gration generally, I hope everyone in
this Chamber can agree that there is a
problem and that it must be addressed
urgently.
In the short term, I hope appropri-
ators can come to an agreement soon
to provide desperately needed funding
to those who are working to manage
this humanitarian crisis in Texas and
in other border States. Without the
Federal Government’s assistance, fund-
ing to support these migrants may
soon dry up, and conditions in these fa-
cilities will rapidly deteriorate.
Additional funding is a much needed
bandaid to help manage this crisis
right now, but we need to continue
working on longer term solutions so
that we can stop the flow of migrants
without hurting our country economi-
cally or doing it in a way that is incon-
sistent with our values and our laws.
Our country relies, for example, on a
strong trading relationship with Mex-
ico. Goods and services that were trad-
ed between our countries in 2018 to-
taled more than $670 billion. Much of
the trade we have is between Texas and
Mexico. Mexico is by far and away my
State’s top trading partner. In 2018,
Texas exported nearly $110 billion in
goods to Mexico. That is roughly four
times the number of exports to our No.
2 trading partner—Canada. We also im-
ported more than $107 billion from our
southern neighbor. That includes ev-
erything from motor vehicle parts, to
computer equipment, to tractors, to
avocados. It is not uncommon to see
certain products, like automobiles,
cross the border multiple times
throughout the production process be-
fore they eventually make their way to
consumers. It is a fact of life that busi-
nesses and jobs in our communities in
Texas and literally around the country
rely on a strong trading relationship
between the United States and Mex-
ico—something I have always sup-
ported and for which I will continue to
advocate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3149
June 3, 2019
I appreciate President Trump’s un-
wavering commitment to securing our
southern border and enforcing our im-
migration laws, and I will continue to
support his efforts to stop the flow of
illegal immigration, to improve phys-
ical security, to close dangerous loop-
holes in the law, and to provide our
frontline officers and agents the tools
and resources they need to carry out
their sworn mission.
It is important to remember that
with any actions that we take to se-
cure our southern border, we must also
keep in mind the important role that
Mexico plays in the economy of the
United States. My State enjoys a
strong relationship economically with
Mexico because of that 1,200-mile com-
mon border and because of the sort of
trading and commercial relationships I
described a moment ago. Any decisions
that would disrupt that relationship
need to be closely examined and de-
bated and be subject to a cost-benefit
analysis.
I believe there are solutions that can
secure our border, that can fix this
mass influx of humanity that is coming
across as a result of the exploitation of
our asylum laws, and that can also de-
liver a secure economy not just for
Texas but for the entire United States.
In Laredo, TX, 14,000 to 16,000 trucks a
day cross the international border be-
tween Laredo, TX, and Nuevo Laredo,
and that is an important part of the
Texas and local economies. They un-
derstand the importance of that cross-
border trade, and they are interested in
working with us to try to make sure we
deal with what is broken when it comes
to our asylum laws.
My friend and colleague HENRY
CUELLAR, who is a Democrat from La-
redo and represents that part of the
State, has joined with me in a bipar-
tisan, bicameral bill to fix what the
Border Patrol and the Department of
Homeland Security say needs fixing in
our asylum laws because there is basi-
cally now a superhighway leading from
Central America, through Mexico, into
the United States, and we are seeing
more and more people being drawn to
the opportunities they have when they
enter the United States and exploit
those broken laws.
My plea to all of our colleagues here
on a bipartisan basis is this: We need to
get serious about fixing these prob-
lems. I think the American people look
at us and wonder why it is we have let
partisan politics overcome our willing-
ness to do the things we said we would
do when we ran for office to benefit the
American people. This is one of those
issues that require a congressional so-
lution. Nobody else can fix it. We need
to get serious about finding solutions
and getting this fixed as soon as we
possibly can.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms.
ERNST). The Senator from Kentucky.
Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
BUDGET PROPOSAL
Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I rise
today to let the American people know
that there are some of us left in Wash-
ington—some of your representatives—
who actually do care about the mount-
ing debt.
We now have over $22 trillion worth
of debt, and you ask yourself: Whose
fault is this? How did it get so out of
control? How did we accumulate so
much debt that we are accumulating
debt at $1.5 million every minute?
Under George W. Bush, the debt went
from about $5 trillion to $10 trillion.
Under President Obama, it went from
$10 trillion to $20 trillion. Under Presi-
dent Trump, it will go from $20 trillion
to about $30 trillion.
So the debt is out of control, and you
ask yourself: Why is no one doing any-
thing about it? Whose fault is it?
Well, really, I think you can see that
it is a bipartisan problem. Both parties
are at fault. We have a debt now that
exceeds $22 trillion. If you have ever
seen usdebtclock.org, you can see the
numbers spinning out of control.
Now, how would that apply to an in-
dividual? Each individual American in
the country owes about $70,000 of that
debt. Some people say: Well, it is so
enormous; do deficits really matter?
In fact, I think it was one of the
changes, when Republicans way back
said that deficits don’t matter. Well, it
actually does matter. It matters to
your budget each year because what
happens is that as interest grows, it
crowds out everything else.
In fact, interest right now is the
fourth leading item in the budget, only
behind Medicare and Social Security
and defense. But if you look at interest
on the debt, what is going to happen
over the next decade or so is that inter-
est is in the red, and you can see inter-
est is climbing and will exceed, over
time, both defense and also Social Se-
curity. So it is a real problem. As in-
terest on the debt rises, it sort of
crowds out all other spending.
So what are people doing about it?
What are your Senators doing about it,
and what are your Congressmen doing
about it? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
The Democrats control the House.
Will they have a budget this year? So
far, goose egg, no budget.
How about the Republicans in the
Senate? Do they have a budget? Well,
they did pass one out, but there is no
plan of ever voting on it on the floor.
So what we will get to vote on today
is my budget. My budget is called the
Penny Plan Budget. What my budget
does is that it cuts one penny out of
every dollar.
(Mr. BOOZMAN assumed the Chair.)
It is interesting because as I see peo-
ple come to Washington—and almost
everybody who comes to Washington
wants money—and I tell them: First of
all, I have to tell you, we have no
money. We are $1 trillion short this
year.
People have such good causes. They
say: Well, we want money for this dis-
ease or that disease.
I say: Well, wait a minute. What if we
said that we will give you 99 percent of
what you had last year? We will give
you one penny less. So if your charity
or disease or the thing you are con-
cerned about got $100 million, next
year you get $99 million.
Here is what is interesting. Most of
these people are advocates for Federal
money. They often advocate for the
State government looking for more
Federal money. I have yet to meet a
person, liberal, conservative or inde-
pendent, who doesn’t say: Hmm, I get
99 percent of what I got last year, and
everybody would get the same? We
would spend 99 percent of what we
spent last year, and it would be spread
across every sector, every sector that
the right or left wants? I say: Yes. We
spend 99 percent, and if you do, guess
what, the budget balances in 5 years—
or at least it did until recently.
I have been proposing the penny
budget for the last 6 or 7 years, and up
until now it actually balanced in 5
years if you cut one penny out of every
dollar, but guess what. The longer you
wait, the more interest there is, the
more of a burden of debt there is, and
the harder it is to actually fix the
problem. So this year, for the first
time, we have to call it a two-penny
plan. It still balances in 5 years, but we
spend only 98 percent of what we spent
the previous year.
What would happen? You will still
have 98 percent of your government. Is
there anybody in America who does not
believe there is 2 percent waste? I
think, if you did a survey of the Amer-
ican people, they would probably be
more accurate than up here. There has
to be 10-percent waste in these pro-
grams. We find it all the time.
I will give you two quick examples.
We are spending $50 billion a year in
Afghanistan, and even for those who
advocate staying in Afghanistan for
another decade or more—which I
don’t—we are spending money on
wasteful things. We spent $90 million
on a luxury hotel across from our Em-
bassy. It was never completed. It is a
shell of a building, and the Taliban can
crawl into this building and shoot
down into our Embassy. Now our sol-
diers have to risk life and limb to pa-
trol an empty hotel that somebody
ripped us off on for 90 million bucks
and fled the country.
We built a $45 million gas station in
Afghanistan. It was supposed to cost a
half million, but 83 cost overruns later,
it cost $45 million. Guess what kind of
gas is pumped at this gas station, if
you could ever get there to see if it ex-
ists—natural gas because somebody de-
cided that the defense industry should
be reducing the carbon footprint of the

world, and we weren’t supposed to be
killing our enemies so much as reduc-
ing the carbon footprint of the world.
So we built a natural gas station in Af-
ghanistan.
The problem? They don’t have any
cars. The average income in Afghani-
stan is about $800 a year, and there are
very few people who have cars, and of
the ones who do have cars, none of
them run on natural gas.
The examples go on and on.
We spent $2 million studying wheth-
er, when someone sneezes on the food
in front of you at the cafeteria, you are
more or less likely to eat the food. It
took them $2 million to figure that one
out.
This is throughout government.
There is, at the least, 1 to 2 percent
waste. There is probably 10 percent
waste and just throwing the money—it
would almost be better just to burn the
money.
What do we do? Who is saying any-
thing about it? The media says no one
is, and this is fake news—it is a lie—be-
cause when the tax cuts came around,
I insisted the tax cuts be paid for. How
many people voted with me? Eight Sen-
ators, all Republicans, not one Demo-
crat.
So you ask yourself what are the
Democrats for? Are the Democrats for
balancing the budget? No, they don’t
care at all about the deficit.
Do Republicans care? Some do, most
don’t. So we are going to have a vote
on my budget which cuts two pennies
out of every dollar, balances the budget
within 5 years, and then actually lets
the budget grow at 2 percent a year for
the remaining 5 years, and we would be
a much stronger nation.
If we were to actually balance the
budget and then let the country move
forward and grow, once again, we
would have the greatest confidence.
The world would have great confidence
in us again. If we don’t do it, I think
there is a real problem coming for us.
There is going to be a day within the
next 10 years that interest will actu-
ally exceed $1 trillion. Right now we
are spending $400 billion on interest. So
it is a real problem. It is crowding out
everything else, and it is becoming one
of the largest items we have in the
budget.
Why can’t we get there? What seems
to be the problem?
The first problem is math. They have
us kind of—it is fuzzy. It is called
Washington math. Washington math, if
you read the Washington Post, they
will say: Oh, no. It is not just cutting
1 percent; your budget is going to cut
$10 trillion over the next 10 years.
Here is what the difference is. If we
don’t spend any more money—last
year, we spent $4 trillion. If we keep
spending $4 trillion over the next 4
years, would that be cutting any
money or spending the same amount?
Be careful what you answer. The
Washington Post and the liberal media
will tell you we have now cut $10 tril-
lion if we keep spending the same
amount over 10 years. Why? Because
they are anticipating the curve of
spending. The baseline of spending, this
red line, is going up. Spending is going
like this, but most people in their nor-
mal household income would say: I
made $40,000 this year, and next year, if
I make $45,000, that is an increase. The
government would say: No, we antici-
pated your making $45,000 next year, so
it is not an increase. They work it on
a baseline that is elevated. So if we
don’t spend $10 trillion more next year
than we did this year, over the next 10
years, they will say we have actually
cut spending. This is a real problem.
For example, it is this dotted green
line. We cut 2 percent a year over a 5-
year period, and then we allow govern-
ment to grow at 2 percent a year. Peo-
ple would say: Oh, well, it doesn’t look
like you are really cutting spending.
That is the truth of the matter. Over a
10-year period, spending will increase
18 percent over where we are today, but
the fake news media will report that
we cut $10 trillion. This is not a round-
ing error. We say spending is going up
18 percent, and the fake news will say
they cut $10 trillion in spending and or-
phans and widows and the older genera-
tion will be out on the doorstep, and
there will be no more government. No.
We are talking about a $4 trillion gov-
ernment that is still spending close to
$4 trillion. What we will not let it do is
go to $5 trillion over the next 10 years.
This is eminently reasonable.
I have talked to people from the
right, the left, and the center, and said:
Can you live with 99 or 98 percent of
what you spent last year? I have yet to
have a person say that for the good of
the country, why don’t we do that.
What would happen is, it would be a
compromise.
Who drives the spending debate
around here? Who drives that we need
more spending? It is really both par-
ties, but recently it has been Repub-
licans. The Republicans say: We have
to have more military spending. The
Democrats say: We will give you more
military spending if you give us more
welfare spending. So all spending goes
up. That is the compromise.
People say we don’t compromise.
Hey, we are spending money, and these
guys compromise every day, and it is
at your expense. It is why the deficit is
so big.
What about a different compromise?
What if the right and the left said mili-
tary is important—the left said, social
welfare is important, but you know
what, for the good of the country, let’s
spend 99 percent of what we spent last
year on these programs or 98 percent.
It could be done, but it takes resolve,
and the American people need to know
that those who are in charge are not
doing anything about this.
Now, some will argue, and the fake
news media has argued, well, it is all
about the tax cut. Republicans don’t
care about the deficit because they cut
taxes. Well, that is actually not true.
We actually had more revenue last
year than the preceding year, even
though we did cut taxes. So we had $14
billion more in taxes but $127 billion
more in spending.
So the problem is a spending prob-
lem. Of all of our spending, which is
about $4 trillion in spending or a little
bit more, about two-thirds of that
spending is Social Security, Medicare,
Medicaid, and food stamps. We don’t
ever vote on any reforms to these pro-
grams. These are called the entitle-
ments, and nobody has any bills. There
are no bills coming forward to look at
the entitlement spending.
Why is this a problem? The remain-
ing third of government spending is
half military and half welfare. If you
eliminated the military spending com-
pletely and eliminated welfare spend-
ing completely, entitlements still drive
the deficit.
So what do we have to do? We have
to make some tough choices. I was
very honest with the people who voted
for me. I told them, look, we are living
longer, and we have less kids, so the
demographics of Social Security and
Medicare don’t work. The main reason
Medicare and Social Security is short
is because we have smaller families.
Your great-grandparents had a lot of
kids, your grandparents had less kids,
you had less kids, and your kids today
are having less. So we have less and
less young people and more and more
old people. It is a demographic imbal-
ance. That is why Social Security is
short, and that is why Medicare is
short, but you can fix them both eas-
ily.
You have to gradually raise the age
when we begin taking Medicare and So-
cial Security. We already did it in So-
cial Security. We did it under Ronald
Reagan and Tip O’Neill. A conservative
Republican and a liberal Democrat in
1983 came together and said: We are
running out of money. What do we do?
They actually did raise the age from 65
for Social Security very gradually to
67. I haven’t heard one person debating
it since. Everybody accepted it and
said: Look, in order to keep these pro-
grams intact and not bankrupt the
country, we have to do this.
This is what Democrats and Repub-
licans should do now: Come together
and say Social Security is $7 trillion
short. Medicare is $35 trillion to $40
trillion short. If you do nothing, they
are both going to implode. If you want
these programs and you want them to
continue, you have to do something.
Very gradually raising the age at
which people start Medicare and Social
Security has to be done. You can either
do it now and do it very gradually, a
month or two a year over a 20-year pe-
riod, or you can wait until they are
completely bankrupt.
If you wait until Social Security is
completely bankrupt in 2034, what hap-
pens is everybody has to take a 25-per-
cent cut, but if you do it very gradu-
ally, you will never have to have these
cuts. It just means that everybody will
have to wait a little bit longer to get
there.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3151
June 3, 2019
It is important that we do have budg-
ets. We have this enormous debt of $22
trillion. We are adding $1 trillion dol-
lars each year. Yet the Senate will not
vote on a budget this year, other than
my budget, and the House, controlled
by Democrats, will not vote on a budg-
et either. So you have both Houses
really not tending to their duty.
Now when we have a vote for the bal-
anced budget amendment, everybody
turns out in force and votes. In 2012, we
had a vote in this body, and every Re-
publican voted to balance the budget in
5 years—an amendment to the Con-
stitution that would require 5 years.
Yet the Republican budget that is com-
ing out of committee never balances.
So we kind of give lip service to this
idea. When people are at home cam-
paigning, they pound the table and say:
We are going to stop the deficits. We
are going to be the frugal party—and
guess what. Neither party has been
very good with your money.
It is because they are afraid. They
get elected, and they become afraid
that they will be unelected if you tell
them the truth.
I think we live in a time where it is
the opposite now. People want someone
to tell the truth—the emperor has no
clothes. Social Security spends more
money than comes in. If we don’t
admit these truths and have a discus-
sion about them and if we are so occu-
pied yelling at each other over elec-
tions and who did what during the last
election—have you heard any discus-
sion on television, have you seen one
television program talk about Social
Security going bankrupt, $7 trillion
short; Medicare going bankrupt, $35 to
$40 trillion short?
Have you heard any news program or
have you seen anything on the news—
right, left, or center—that actually
talks about our problems? No, it is
yack, yack, yack about election this
and election that. People are still un-
happy with the results of the election,
when in reality maybe we should talk
about some of the difficult problems
that confront us.
I think the No. 1 threat to our na-
tional security is our debt. I am not
alone. Admiral Mullin, who was Chief
of Staff under President Obama, said
the same thing. There are people in the
military who understand that maybe
our military mission is so big that our
military can’t keep up with it. If we
are going to have troops in 50 of 54 Af-
rican countries, if we are going to have
troops in every Middle Eastern coun-
try, and if we are going to have large
bases in Iraq and Afghanistan, yes,
maybe we don’t have enough money.
Our Founding Fathers said you only
go to war when Congress votes on it.
Recently, there has been a rattling of
sabers over Iran. We are tightening the
screws on Iran and not letting them
sell oil to anyone. They are getting
their back up and tensions are flaring.
Well, the Constitution says very clear-
ly that you don’t go to war with any-
body—including Iran—unless you ask
Congress for permission.
The President does not have permis-
sion to take us to war. Many people
don’t realize this. The Founding Fa-
thers specifically didn’t want to give
that power. In fact, it was Madison who
said that the executive is the branch
most prone to war; therefore, we have,
with studied care, vested the power to
go to war in Congress. Yet we live in a
time in which Presidents of both par-
ties take us to war. President Obama
began and continued the war in Syria,
in Libya. President Trump has contin-
ued those things on both sides of the
aisle. But it is not just whether it is
good or bad foreign policy; it is ex-
traordinarily expensive. We are bank-
rupting the American people. We are
borrowing money at a million and a
half dollars every minute. Really, this
is sort of a crummy gift to the next
generation. It is like: Oh, by the way,
you are lucky. You are going to be in-
heriting the national debt, and you will
be paying for it.
Kids already realize they are inher-
iting this college debt. It is difficult to
pay college debt. As you look at this
and you look at the individual share,
here is 2015—about $58,000 per person
with the debt. But look at what it is
doing over time. It is pyramiding. The
debt is beginning to explode because we
are just doing nothing to rein it in.
Whenever we have a vote on trying to
do something about the debt, as we did
when we passed the tax cut—I intro-
duced a budget motion that said the
tax cut should be paid for with spend-
ing cuts. We got eight Republicans. I
introduced another motion that said
we should use budget reconciliation—
fancy words for a majority vote—to ac-
tually rein in the spending and entitle-
ments. I got four votes.
There aren’t enough people up here.
The people up here don’t seem to care
about the debt. They just think, oh, we
will just pile it on, and we will be fine.
But we are hollowing out the country.
When people talk about hollowing out
the country, the one thing is the debt.
We superficially are doing quite well
at this point, but there will be a day of
reckoning. There will be a day of reck-
oning on which the government will
have to make a decision, and the deci-
sion becomes to print more money to
pay for the debt, at which time the
country loses the value of its currency.
It is happening in Venezuela. Do you
know what the inflation is down there?
It is 130,000 percent. The money is
worthless as soon as they print it. You
have to be paid a couple times during
the day because if you start working at
8:00 in the morning, by 5:00 in the
evening, the money is worth less and
less. It virtually has no value.
We have to decide. Do you want
something for nothing? Do you really
believe we can give you free college?
Do you think it is really free? Do you
think nobody is going to have to pay
for it? Do you think we can give you
free healthcare? Do you think we can
give you a free car or a free cell phone?
No. Somebody pays for it. If we don’t
pay for it through taxes, we just pile
on the debt, and we are destroying the
country with it. Most people sort of
know this instinctively. There is no
ability to have something for nothing.
You have to work for it.
The thing is, if we go on and on and
say we are just going to keep piling on
the debt, the day of reckoning is com-
ing, and when it comes, a once great
country could be dragged down by this
mountain of debt that we have.
Today my budget will be put forward.
It is the Penny Plan budget. The Penny
Plan budget is now basically the two-
penny budget because it no longer bal-
ances in 5 years if we cut one penny.
But if we cut two pennies, meaning
that next year, we would spend 98 per-
cent of what we spent this year—is
there anybody in America who thinks
the government and the people who re-
ceive stuff from the government
couldn’t live on 98 percent?
When I ask people in my office who
actually work in the private sector,
they say yes. Many times in their ca-
reer, there was a downturn in sales,
and they had to take less money or less
income—some people said significantly
less—or they had to cut back on their
family expenses. Do you know what
government does? The opposite. If we
go into a recession, there is this left-
wing, egg-headed idea that we should
spend more money, that we should go
further into debt and start lavishing
out money instead of—when you are
not selling things and things aren’t
doing as well, you cut back on your
consumption. You cut back on things.
We have a great country. We
shouldn’t let it get away from us. I
don’t think there is any way in the
world we could not move on and be-
come a stronger nation if we would try
the Penny Plan. Like I said, people
should pay attention to this because
all these representatives—at least on
the Republican side—go home and say
they are for balanced budgets, but they
are not really for balanced budgets if
they vote for budgets that never bal-
ance.
The budget by Republicans coming
out of the Senate committee never bal-
ances. The budget from the Democrats
hasn’t even made it out of committee.
There probably will be no vote in the
House or the Senate on the budget.
Neither one of them ever balances. It is
in the Republican rules that we are
supposed to advocate for a budget that
balances in at least 10 years. Now we
are putting forward budgets that never
balance.
Look at what the deficit has done.
The red is what has already occurred,
and the pink is what is to come. Most
of this is driven by entitlements. You
will hear that as an argument. Particu-
larly in the Republican caucus, they
will say: Yeah, it is all driven by enti-
tlements. We need to do something
about entitlements.
Then you put forward a bill. I have a
bill. I have a bill to reform Social Se-
curity by gradually letting the age go

up a month or two a year over the next
20 years. I also would means test the
benefits, meaning that wealthier peo-
ple would receive a little bit less Social
Security. People would say: Well, I
don’t want to do that. If you don’t, the
whole system is going to implode. So
can’t we go ahead and just do it now
and do it in the least painful sort of
way?
Do you know how many people I have
on my bill? I think there are four peo-
ple brave enough to put their names on
a bill that would gradually allow the
Social Security age to go up. But if you
talk to people quietly, even on the
other side of the aisle, they will admit
to you that, yeah, we ought to do
something, but nobody ever does any-
thing. The other side says: We will do
it only if you raise taxes on the
wealthy. We already have a progressive
Tax Code.
Interestingly—a lot of people don’t
know this—our Tax Code in America is
more progressive than Scandinavia’s.
You have heard some of the clamor for
socialism. They want Swedish social-
ism. Well, we have higher taxes on the
wealthy than they do in Sweden. In
fact, in Sweden, in Denmark, it is the
opposite, actually—the middle class
and the poor are more heavily taxed
than in our country.
When you look and you hear people
say ‘‘Well, Sweden and Denmark—why
don’t we become Denmark? Let’s give
everybody paid leave, free paid leave.
Let’s give the uncle of the baby free
paid leave. Let’s give everybody—the
grandparents need paid leave. It is all
going to be free,’’ well, guess what,
they do stuff like that in Scandinavia,
but everybody pays a 25-percent sales
tax. It is not free. Everybody pays a 25-
percent sales tax in Scandinavia.
In addition, the income tax in Den-
mark—and many of the other countries
are similar—is 60 percent at $60,000. Do
you want to buy a car in Scandinavia?
Do you wonder why these people are
freezing, riding their bike all winter
long? There is a 200-percent tax to buy
a car. If you want to buy a $30,000 car,
you have to have $60,000 up front to pay
the government, and then you need an-
other $30,000 to buy the car.
It is not free. There is no free lunch.
When people say that government can
provide you all these things, they can
only do it by either taxing you or bor-
rowing. Right now, we are doing it
mostly through borrowing.
The reason I think it is probably des-
tined to get worse over time is we have
gradually taken people off the tax
rolls. Really, below $50,000, there is a
very minimal amount of income tax
being paid. In fact, those who are in
the top 10 percent pay almost all of the
income tax in our country. People say:
We need to stick it to the rich; the rich
aren’t paying their fair share. Guess
what. The top 10 percent pay 87 percent
of the income tax. Almost all of the in-
come tax is paid by the top 10 percent.
If you go to the top 50 percent—that is
$75,000 and above—it is well over 90 per-
cent. Ninety-six or ninety-seven per-
cent of the income tax is paid for by
people who make $75,000 and above.
There is a young socialist on the
other side who says: We need a special
tax on the rich, on those who make $10
million a year. You have heard this.
Even Republicans are saying: Well,
yeah, let’s stick it to the rich. Let’s
get those filthy rich people.
Let’s say you do it, put a 70-percent
tax on those who make $10 million.
Well, let’s do the math. What does it
bring in? Let’s say they all continue to
work, and let’s say they all pay their
taxes and don’t move to another coun-
try. That will bring in $50 billion. That
sounds like a lot of money. How much
would Medicare for All cost? Sixty tril-
lion dollars. All right. The tax brings
in $50 billion. The spending proposal for
just Medicare for All is $60 trillion. For
the Green New Deal, add another $10
trillion. Their spending proposals are
so big—no one can even define them
within a few trillion dollars because
they are so enormous.
Realize what I said before: The def-
icit is driven by what you already
have. You have Medicare for senior
citizens. It is $35 trillion short. If you
were $35 trillion short, does it make
sense to now expand Medicare to every-
one? So what we have is Medicare for
Some, Medicare for senior citizens. It
is $35 trillion short, and they want to
expand it to everybody.
Also, realize they want to ban insur-
ance. There will be no insurance com-
panies and no insurance through your
employer. Right now, there are 180 mil-
lion people who have health insurance.
Do you think it is going to be a very
pleasant transition to having every-
body on the government insurance?
Where is the money going to come
from?
These proposals are ludicrous on
their face. We face mounting debt and
deficits from what we have. This
should be a no-brainer. These people
should be laughed out of polite society.
No one who is intellectually honest
should listen to these people. There is
really no reason for them to be in the
discourse because they are so com-
pletely out of touch with reality. We
have so much debt from what we are
already trying to give you through
Medicare and Social Security. These
people want to double, triple, and quad-
ruple that. It doesn’t work. It is a rec-
ipe for disaster.
As you look around the world, as peo-
ple get more and more in debt and
there is more and more spending, look
what happens. Look what happens as
we approach socialism around the
world. If you look at the examples of
socialism from the last century, it is a
history of famine and genocide—Stalin,
Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, Castro, Chavez,
Maduro. It doesn’t work.
We actually live in the best time ever
to be alive in the history of the world.
Does that sound excessive? It is abso-
lutely true. In 1800, 80 percent of people
lived in extreme poverty. When I was
born in the 1960s, it was down to a third
of the people who lived in extreme pov-
erty, $2 a day or less. It went from 80
percent to a third. In the span of my
lifetime, it is under 10 percent. I am
not talking about America; I am talk-
ing about the whole world. Less than 10
percent of the people live in extreme
poverty now. You have to ask yourself
why. How did we get here? Was it just
an accident? Was it a fluke? Were we
born with oil under the ground, and all
of a sudden we got rich?
For some nations, sometimes that
could be true. Look at Venezuela. They
have more oil under the ground, more
oil deposits than any other country in
the world, and socialism took the rich-
est country in the world and made it
the poorest country in the world. They
are eating their pets in Venezuela.
They are starving. The average person
has lost 20 pounds. What does that have
to do with the budget? They got over-
extended. Their deficit became massive
even in the face of oil revenue.
People say America is a rich country.
Yes, we are a rich country, but we are
overextended. I don’t want our country
to be Venezuela. When the President
said America will not become a social-
ist nation, I took that at face value. If
we don’t want to be a socialist nation,
we can’t keep piling on the debt.
What I have today is a proposal. We
will see if anybody chooses it. My pre-
diction is that not one Democrat will
vote to balance the budget. They vote
to hike all your taxes a million per-
cent, which would kill the economy,
and they would say: Oh, that is how we
balance the budget. But they will not
vote to cut any spending. They will not
vote to even control spending.
My budget over 10 years actually
slowly increases spending over time.
We keep it steady, and we cut it 1 or 2
percent for 5 years, and then we allow
it to grow at 2 percent. We could do
that and be a stronger country, but we
have to examine the failures in history.
We have to examine what has happened
under socialism, Big Government, and
debt in other countries and decide
whether we want to go that way, decide
whether we are going to simplistically
say: Gimmee, gimmee, gimmee. I want
something for nothing, and there is no
reason I should have to work for it. It
is just not fair unless you give it to me.
Realize there will be a price. There is
no such thing as a free lunch. There is
no such thing as something for noth-
ing.
I offer this budget to the American
people, and I hope you will watch all
your representatives vote. Not one
Democrat will vote for it, but over half
the Republicans won’t vote for it ei-
ther. They will say: It is too dramatic.
We can’t cut spending that much.
One penny out of a dollar is what I
have been proposing for 5 years. I usu-
ally get 15 to 20 votes. Now we have had
to go up to two pennies for every dollar
because nobody is really doing any-
thing to cut spending, and spending is
still exploding. So this is called the

75TH ANNIVERSARY OF D-DAY
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, in the
early morning hours of June 6, 1944,
75,000 members of the U.S. Armed
Forces and 75,000 of their counterparts
in the Allied Expeditionary Force
launched Operation Overlord when
they stormed ashore five landing areas
on the beaches of Normandy, France,
to break the Nazi stranglehold on
Western Europe. This courageous fight
to seize the beaches of Normandy
changed the trajectory of history.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3154 June 3, 2019
This week we commemorate the 75th
anniversary of this historic operation
and express our gratitude and apprecia-
tion to the members of the U.S. Armed
Forces, including those from Arkansas
who participated in this undertaking.
Let us also reflect on the courage,
heroism, and sacrifice that these self-
less Allied heroes demonstrated in the
face of evil. While fully aware of the
dangers and the perils that were before
them, they bravely accomplished their
mission to defend our country, ideals,
and allies.
During an interview for the Veterans
History Project, Wallace Cunningham
of Little Rock described the scene he
saw while in Oxford, England, as the
Allies were readying the D-Day inva-
sion. ‘‘Aircraft from one end of the ho-
rizon to the other,’’ he said. He was
overwhelmed by the number of aircraft
in the sky, a testament to the power
and force that the Allies were mar-
shaling for this strategically vital en-
deavor. The sight below was similar,
with boats carrying GIs across the
English Channel bound for France.
Arkansans like Cecil Blair remember
the rigorous training he and his fellow
soldiers underwent in England in early
1944. They didn’t know at the time, but
they were preparing for D-Day. Blair’s
boat was hit before landing in France,
forcing the crew to pull back and make
the trek again 3 days later.
The bravery exhibited during this
battle will never be forgotten. Allied
forces were in German crosshairs, and
they willingly faced their fears head-
on. The magnitude of their actions con-
tinues to be felt and recognized to this
day.
Now, 19-year old Jesse Beazley of
Kentucky was on one of the ships
bound for Normandy in June 1944. In an
interview for the Veterans History
Project nearly 60 years later, he re-
called thinking in the moments leading
up to the operation about how likely
he was to survive, saying he probably
didn’t have much of a chance to live
because he knew what was ahead of
him and his fellow soldiers.
The other troops in his transport
boat were his age, and he remembered
their looks and collective feeling. He
said: ‘‘All at once it got completely si-
lent, and young men looked like old
men.’’
They endured great hardships getting
to the beach. Beazley’s boat was blown
up far from shore. He was thrown into
the icy water where he was forced to
dump most of his gear before swim-
ming to safety, all while German bul-
lets were piercing the air inches away
from him. He described the devastation
as ‘‘a nightmare.’’
Approximately 10,000 Allied soldiers
were wounded or killed during the D-
Day landings, including 6,000 Ameri-
cans. Many of these heroic individuals
are buried in the Normandy American
Cemetery. The graves of brave Ameri-
cans dot the landscape where these
courageous liberators fought and died.
The crosses and Stars of David that
mark their places of rest shine in the
sunlight on the cliffs of Normandy, giv-
ing hope for peace and reminding us of
the costs of war.
The Normandy American Cemetery is
the jewel of American Battle Monu-
ments Commission sites. Approxi-
mately 1 million visitors each year pay
their respects to those who lost their
lives in the D-Day invasion and the
battles that followed. The cemetery
and visitor center recognize the sac-
rifice of members of the Armed Forces
who served at this turning point of the
war, including the story of PFC Harold
Eugene Sellers of Jonesboro, AR. Sell-
ers was a member of the Army’s 101st
Airborne Division. As a pathfinder, his
mission was to lead the invasion by
parachuting behind enemy lines into
Normandy and setting up radar lights
for C–47s, which had been loaded with
additional paratroopers the night be-
fore the amphibious landing.
He jumped over France and was tar-
geted by German gunfire. He didn’t
make it to the ground. Sellers landed
in a tree not far from Utah Beach,
where he was killed. He was one of the
first American casualties of D-Day.
D-Day was the largest amphibious in-
vasion in history. It remains one of our
Nation’s greatest military achieve-
ments. As a cochair of the Senate
French Caucus, I was honored to intro-
duce a resolution recognizing the 75th
anniversary of this operation and ac-
knowledging the courage and sacrifice
of the Allied troops who came to the
aid of those oppressed by Nazi and Fas-
cist regimes.
The courage, strength, and deter-
mination of members of the Greatest
Generation who were called to defend
freedom at Normandy will always serve
as an inspiration for future generations
of Americans. We must honor and con-
tinue to defend what they fought for
and fulfill our obligation to support all
of our veterans and their families.
This solemn occasion, the 75th anni-
versary of D-Day, deserves our utmost
respect and admiration. Let us resolve
to reflect on the sacrifice and heroism
displayed on behalf of our Nation and
the cause of freedom. Let us also com-
mit to let it influence us in ways that
challenge us to pursue the same devo-
tional service to America as the gen-
eration that stormed the beaches of
Normandy in 1944.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.

f
S. 1332
∑ Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this
afternoon we voted on cloture to pro-
ceed to a budget resolution written by
my Republican colleague Senator RAND
PAUL from Kentucky.
This is a budget that would lead to
devastating cuts to Medicare, Med-
icaid, nutrition assistance, and edu-
cation, while paving the way for even
more tax breaks to the top 1 percent
and large, profitable corporations.
Make no mistake about it: Senator
PAUL’S budget is an immoral budget. It
is bad economic policy. While I am con-
fident that this resolution will be de-
feated in the Senate, let me be very
clear.
Nearly half of the Republican Caucus
in the Senate voted to advance Senator
PAUL’S budget, including some of the
most senior members of this body. The
vision of America this budget puts for-
ward—balancing the budget on the
backs of working families, the elderly,
the sick, the children, and the poor in
order to make the richest people in
America even richer—is the vision of
the Republican Party as a whole.
So let me commend Senator PAUL for
being honest with the American people
in terms of what he believes and for
putting down on paper what the Repub-
lican Party and billionaire campaign
contributors like the Koch brothers
and Sheldon Adelson believe.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3155
June 3, 2019
And this is what they want.
At a time of massive wealth and in-
come inequality, Senator PAUL and the
Republicans who voted to advance this
budget do not believe that it was good
enough to provide nearly $2 trillion in
tax breaks to the wealthiest people and
most profitable corporations. The
budget that we are debating would ex-
tend those tax breaks for the wealthy
and the powerful.
Two years ago, the Congressional Re-
publicans came very close to passing a
bill that would have thrown 32 million
Americans off of health insurance. Sen-
ator PAUL and those who voted to ad-
vance this budget believe that earlier
effort did not go far enough. The budg-
et we are debating would throw up to 40
million Americans off of Medicaid.
A few months ago, President Trump
proposed a budget calling for Medicare
to be cut by nearly $845 billion. Sen-
ator PAUL and the Republicans who
support this budget do not believe
those cuts went far enough. The budget
we are debating would cut Medicare by
up to $3.4 trillion over the next decade.
At a time when 40 million Americans
struggle with hunger, Senator PAUL
and the Republicans who vote for this
budget want to cut the SNAP program
by $223 billion, cutting 16 million peo-
ple off of the program by 2029.
Overall, Senator PAUL’S resolution
calls for slashing the budget by more
than 51 percent by the end of the dec-
ade.
Not too long ago, if someone pro-
posed cutting Medicare, Medicaid, and
nutrition assistance in half so that bil-
lionaires could get a huge tax break,
that would have been considered a rad-
ical and extreme agenda. Today, it is
the mainstream position of the Repub-
lican Party in Washington.
The reality is that Republicans in
Washington have never believed in
Medicare, Medicaid, Federal assistance
in education, or providing any direct
government assistance to those in
need. They have always believed that
tax breaks for the wealthy and the
powerful would somehow miraculously
trickle down to every American, de-
spite all history and evidence to the
contrary.
Needless to say, and I am only speak-
ing for myself, I have a very different
vision of America.
In my view, we need to create a gov-
ernment and an economy that works
for all of us, not just a handful of bil-
lionaires.
What does that mean?
It means that, instead of giving tril-
lions of dollars in tax breaks to the top
1 percent and large profitable corpora-
tions, we must demand that Wall
Street, the billionaire class, and large,
profitable corporations start paying
their fair share in taxes.
Instead of trying to abolish the es-
tate tax, which impacts less than one-
tenth of 1 percent, we must substan-
tially increase the inheritance tax not
only to bring in needed revenue, but to
dismantle the oligarchs that now con-
trol so much of our economic and polit-
ical lives.
Instead of making it easier for cor-
porations to avoid paying U.S. taxes by
stashing their cash in the Cayman Is-
lands, we need to crack down on off-
shore tax haven abuse and use this rev-
enue to create 15 million good paying
American jobs rebuilding our crum-
bling infrastructure.
Instead of cutting Social Security,
we need to expand Social Security so
that every American can retire with
the dignity and the respect they de-
serve, and we pay for that by making
sure everyone who makes over $250,000
a year pays the same percentage of
their income into Social Security as
the middle class.
Instead of cutting Medicare, we need
to guarantee healthcare as a right to
every man, woman, and child in Amer-
ica through a Medicare for all, single-
payer healthcare program.
Instead of slashing Federal aid to
education, we must make every public
college and university in America tui-
tion free, and we pay for that by impos-
ing a tax on Wall Street speculation. If
we could bail out Wall Street 10 years
ago, we can tax Wall Street so that
every American who has the desire and
the ability can get a higher education
regardless of their income.
Instead of listening to the Koch
brothers, Sheldon Adelson, and other
multibillionaire campaign contribu-
tors, it is time to start listening to the
overwhelming majority of Americans
who want a government and an econ-
omy that works for the many, not just
the few.
Let us not only defeat the Paul budg-
et, but let us have the guts to take on
the greed of Wall Street, the greed of
the pharmaceutical and health care in-
dustry, the greed of big oil, and the
greed of corporate America and break
up the oligarchy that is destroying the
social fabric of our society.∑

stability in this region.
The proposed sale will contribute to Bul-
garia’s capability to provide for the defense
of its airspace, regional security, and inter-
operability with the United States and
NATO. These aircraft will provide Bulgaria
with a fleet of modernized multi-role combat
aircraft, ensuring that Bulgaria can effec-
tively operate in hazardous areas and en-
hancing the Bulgarian Air Force’s interoper-
ability with U.S. as well as NATO forces.
Bulgaria currently relies on the United
States and the United Kingdom to partici-
pate in joint air policing. By acquiring these
F–16s and the associated sustainment and
training package, Bulgaria will be able to
provide for the defense of its own airspace
and borders. Bulgaria will have no difficulty
absorbing this aircraft and services into its
armed forces.
The proposed sale of this equipment will
not alter the basic military balance in the
region.
The prime contractor will be Lockheed
Corporation, Bethesda, Maryland. There are
no known offset agreements proposed in con-
nection with this potential sale.
Implementation of this proposed sale will
not require the assignment of any additional
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to Bulgaria.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE
MILWAUKEE URBAN LEAGUE
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, today
I rise to recognize the Milwaukee
Urban League on its 100th anniversary.
It gives me great pleasure to honor this
remarkable organization and to com-
memorate this historic milestone.
The Milwaukee Urban League was es-
tablished in 1919 as an affiliate of the
National Urban League, which grew
out of the national quest for freedom
and opportunity. During the emergence
of the Milwaukee Urban League, mil-
lions of African Americans were mi-
grating from the South to Northern
States like Wisconsin in search of
greater opportunity and a better qual-
ity of life. The newcomers soon learned
that they had not escaped racial dis-
crimination in jobs, education, and
housing. By teaching useful skills and
offering an array of resources, the Mil-
waukee Urban League sought to help
African Americans through this dif-
ficult transition to urban life and em-
ployment in a manufacturing economy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3158 June 3, 2019
Throughout its early years, the Mil-
waukee Urban League was instru-
mental in fighting for social justice
and equal opportunity for African
Americans. The league became a strong
and dedicated voice for the poor and
underserved by helping them obtain de-
cent housing, acquire workforce train-
ing and leadership skills, find health
care, and ensure their children had ac-
cess to education and opportunity.
Over the past century, the Mil-
waukee Urban League has made tre-
mendous gains helping African Ameri-
cans achieve their greatest potential.
The league has continued to promote
self-sufficiency through a variety of
programs that teach professional
skills. The Milwaukee Urban League
has also demonstrated an unprece-
dented commitment to education and
youth engagement. By supporting ini-
tiatives to improve the lives of those
who are often left behind, the Mil-
waukee Urban League has brought
about meaningful change in Wiscon-
sin’s largest city.
With the great challenges still facing
the African-American community
today, Milwaukee continues to need
the league’s leadership, strength, and
resilience. Despite the organization’s
unflagging efforts, rising tides have not
raised all boats equally, and unaccept-
able disparities continue to exist.
Wages, educational outcomes, eco-
nomic conditions, neighborhood safety,
and the opportunity to achieve the
American dream still depend to a large
degree on a person’s ZIP Code or the
color of his or her skin.
By working together, we can ensure
that African Americans and all com-
munity members are educated, em-
ployed, and empowered to succeed. The
league’s persistent commitment to im-
proving opportunities for those trapped
in poverty fosters hope for the next
generation of leaders in Milwaukee’s
communities of color.
As the Milwaukee Urban League both
celebrates its accomplishments and re-
flects on its future challenges, I will be
forever grateful for the league’s
achievements over the past century,
and I look forward to its continued suc-
cess in the years to come.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO MARK WRIGHTON
∑ Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I take
this opportunity to honor the work and
career of Chancellor Mark Wrighton of
Washington University in St. Louis. On
May 31, 2019, Chancellor Wrighton con-
cluded his term as chancellor after 24
years at Washington University.
In 1995, Chancellor Wrighton began
his career at Washington University in
St. Louis. He was brought to St. Louis
to serve as the 14th chancellor to one
of the top institutions in the United
States. Consistently ranked in the top
20 for best universities and currently
ranked No. 8 for best research and med-
ical schools, Washington University in
St. Louis’s reputation has grown; and
its academic reach expanded under the
leadership of Chancellor Wrighton. Al-
though it was already a top school
when he arrived, Chancellor Wrighton
had a strong vision for boosting the
full-time faculty numbers, making cap-
ital improvements to continue the
high-quality learning experience for
students, expanding their reach inter-
nationally, and enhancing the advance-
ments in their medical research.
Under his guidance and leadership,
Chancellor Wrighton saw the construc-
tion of 50 new buildings, including a
state-of-the-art research facility, the
Debra and George W. Couch III Bio-
medical Research Building that is
home to top researchers involved in ge-
netics, genomics, and regenerative bi-
ology. In addition, one of his projects
that has arguably made the biggest im-
pact in St. Louis and is playing an im-
portant role in cancer research is the
development of the Alvin J. Siteman
Cancer Center. His focus on capital im-
provements to enhance the quality of
learning and research, as well as hiring
the best leadership to oversee the fac-
ulty, doctors, and researchers at the
Washington University School of Medi-
cine, have led to pivotal results in the
areas of treating, researching, and de-
veloping new approaches to dealing
with diseases, such as cancer and Alz-
heimer’s. His comprehensive vision for
the best talent to work in top-quality
facilities has pioneered the way for
better approaches to personalized med-
icine and lifesaving treatment making
a significant contribution to address-
ing many of the complicated diseases
facing patients and the families that
love them.
In addition to medical care and re-
search, Chancellor Wrighton had a vi-
sion for contributing to the entrepre-
neurial climate in St. Louis and sup-
porting the St. Louis community.
There have been many positive local
impacts made by Washington Univer-
sity, but an important commitment
Chancellor Wrighton supported as an
original collaborator was to launch
Cortex. Cortex is the St. Louis home to
the region’s largest innovation campus
for bioscience and technology startups
and companies. Chancellor Wrighton’s
early and continued support of enter-
prises such as Cortex and other col-
laborations, like the Donald Danforth
Plant Science Center, demonstrate his
commitment to support local economic
growth and enhance job creation.
Over the years Chancellor Wrighton
has been an instrumental leader not
just in the St. Louis region but across
the country. He is not only known for
being one of the best in the field of
chemistry, which is where he started
his career, but for being the best in
educating our next generation of stu-
dents, researchers, and citizens to be
productive, engaged, and to make a dif-
ference.
Chancellor Wrighton has led Wash-
ington University in St. Louis with
great integrity. He has been a valuable
partner to the St. Louis community.
He has been and I am sure will con-
tinue to be an important adviser to me
and to those that will seek his exper-
tise to help address the many issues
facing our region, State, and country.
He has laid the groundwork for his suc-
cessor to continue to enhance the qual-
ity education Washington University
in St. Louis has been recognized for
over the past several decades.
We thank him for his years of com-
mitment to the University and to the
St. Louis region.∑

TRIBUTE TO JOYCE WOODHOUSE
∑ Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President,
today I rise to recognize a true Nevada
public servant, State Senator Joyce
Woodhouse. For over 50 years, Senator
Woodhouse has been an education
champion who has dedicated her life to
ensuring that every child in Nevada
has an opportunity to succeed. Senator
Woodhouse will complete her final ses-
sion of the Nevada Legislature on June
3, 2019, and her last term as senator at
the end of next year.
Senator Joyce Woodhouse came to
Las Vegas in 1966 for her first teaching
position after graduating from Carroll
College in her home State of Montana.
She has dedicated her life and career to
serving the children of Nevada since
then. She was an elementary school
teacher and principal at JM Ullom Ele-
mentary School before joining and
eventually leading the Clark County
School District’s School Community
Partnership Program. During her ten-
ure, she sought to bring local busi-
nesses together in strategic partner-
ships to support Nevada’s schools.
Senator Woodhouse was first elected
to the Nevada Legislature in 2006. She
has served the State in that capacity
for nearly 12 years. She has led critical
deliberations regarding the funding
needs of the State as past chair of the
Senate Education Committee and as
current chair of the Senate Finance
Committee. Her experience as a teach-
er and school administrator has given
her a deep understanding of the needs
of students, teachers, and parents, and
that connection has inspired her
throughout her career in public serv-
ice.
Senator Woodhouse has been a fierce
advocate for hard-working Nevadans in
the State Senate. She helped broker
compromises to secure as many re-
sources as possible on behalf of stu-
dents. She has fought for the health
and well-being of our senior citizens, as
well as the dignity and respect of our
working families. Most recently, she
was the lead advocate for ensuring all
Nevadans have access to paid leave.
In addition to her commitment to
our students, our schools, and all Ne-
vadans as State senator, Senator
Woodhouse has been a dedicated volun-
teer in our community. Before serving
as a public servant, she was a vocal ad-
vocate for educators and the children

State Education Association. She con-
tinued to lend her voice in many roles
throughout the years, including treas-
urer and board member for Kids Voting
Southern Nevada, and cochair of the
Southern Nevada Science Education
Consortium. While Senator Woodhouse
closes this chapter of her career in pub-
lic service, I have no doubt that she
will continue to serve the people of Ne-
vada for years to come.
I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing and thanking Senator
Woodhouse’s lifelong commitment to
public education.
Thank you, Senator Woodhouse, for
all that you have done for our children,
our schools, and the future of the great

REMEMBERING LENORA LAPIDUS
∑ Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as
ranking member on the Senate Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor,
and Pensions, I wish to honor a public
servant who established a remarkable
legacy as a passionate champion for
gender equality, Lenora Lapidus.
Lenora fought for the rights of all
Americans. Over the course of her ca-
reer, Lenora distinguished herself as a
civil rights leader. She began working
at the ACLU in 1988 as a summer intern
and rose to serve as legal director of
the ACLU of New Jersey and led the
Women’s Rights Project since 2001. At
the ACLU, Lenora fought tirelessly in
the courts on behalf of women and
girls, winning cases that pushed us to
respond to gender-based violence and
ensured that combat positions in the
military were open to all Americans,
among many other cases.
Lenora was also a tireless champion
for improving lives through policy. She
played an important role in the Be
HEARD Act, legislation I introduced
this Congress along with many others,
which is the first comprehensive plan
to fight harassment in the workplace.
Lenora made sure the fight for gender
equality included all women, including
low-wage workers whose stories are too
often ignored or forgotten. Her legacy
is a testament to the work and passion
she brought to every fight against in-
justice. Lenora is irreplaceable, and
her loss will be felt by all of us who
worked with her.
I hope my colleagues will join me in
recognizing the life and important
work of Lenora.∑

RECOGNIZING PARTNER STEEL CO.
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, this
month I celebrate the power of the
American entrepreneurial spirit by
highlighting the success of a small
business in my home State of Idaho.
Hard work, innovation, and persever-
ance are some of the characteristics
that have helped so many of our Na-
tion’s citizens achieve the American
Dream. As a member and former chair-
man of the Senate Committee on Small
Business and Entrepreneurship, it is
my distinct privilege to recognize
Partner Steel Co. as the Idaho Small
Business of the Month for June 2019.
Partner Steel Co. first opened its
doors in Pocatello, ID, in 1947 as a cus-
tom steel fabricator and wholesaler.
Since then, Partner Steel has expanded
to provide Idaho-made products not
only to Idahoans, but to consumers all
over the world. Partner Steel uses
high-quality raw materials to produce
custom creations, meeting the unique
needs of each individual customer. As a
commercial steel supplier, Partner
Steel Co. provides steel to large and
small clients across the United States.
Spanning beyond the realm of com-
mercial steel supply and custom steel
fabrication, Partner Steel Co. has an
outdoor camping equipment line. They
create products such as camping
stoves, Dutch ovens, griddles, coffee
pots and water purifiers for outdoor
sanitation. These camping supplies
have generated an international cus-
tomer base, from the United States to
Canada, Europe, and Australia.
After operating Partner Steel for
more than five decades, the Partner
family decided to sell the business in
2005. Having worked at Partner Steel
for more than 30 years, Rick Eskelson
had a deep understanding of the oper-
ations of the company, and he and his
wife Debbie made the decision to buy
the business. Now owners for 15 years,
the Eskelsons have continued sup-
plying steel products to Pocatello resi-
dents and consumers around the globe.
In addition to operating their small
business, the Eskelsons have
prioritized reinvesting into the Poca-
tello community. Rick and Debbie are
avid supporters of the local 4H club,
local sports teams and high schools,
and are involved in the Pocatello busi-
ness community.
It is my honor to recognize Rick and
Debbie Eskelson and the employees of
Partner Steel Co. for their outstanding
contributions to the Pocatello commu-
nity. You make our State proud, and I
look forward to your continued suc-
cess.∑

David Parks.
Senator Parks arrived in Nevada to
serve as an airman in the U.S. Air
Force. He served our country with
honor from 1967–1971 and was stationed
at Nevada’s own Nellis Air Force Base.
After receiving his master of business
administration from the University of
Nevada, Las Vegas, he used his busi-
ness expertise to work on behalf of the
southern Nevada community he loved
dearly. Among his various public serv-
ice positions, Parks served as chairman
of the Paradise Town Advisory Board,
the director of the Office of Budget and
Management for the city of Las Vegas,
and the assistant director of the Re-
gional Transportation Commission of
southern Nevada.
David Parks first brought his exten-
sive experience in local government to
the Nevada Legislature when he was
elected to the Nevada Assembly in 1997.
He served the assembly with honor and
integrity as the assistant majority
whip and then later as the assistant
majority floor leader. In 2008, Parks’
community elected him to the Nevada
State Senate, representing Whitney
and parts of Paradise, Henderson, and
Sunrise Manor. He was subsequently
reelected in 2012 and again in 2016.
In his 22 years of legislative experi-
ence and life of public service, Senator
Parks has remained a steadfast cham-
pion for the LGBTQ community by en-
suring equal rights and protections for
LGBTQ individuals throughout the
State and serving for many years on
the Governor’s Statewide AIDS Advi-
sory Task Force. Nevada’s progressive
leadership on many issues that affect
LGBTQ Nevadans is a direct result of
the senator’s advocacy and persistence.
During his tenure in the legislature, he
has been the State’s leader on pursuing
LGBTQ equality, leading efforts to in-
stitute civil unions in Nevada, ban dis-
crimination based on gender identity
or expression, and address bullying and
cyber-bullying in Nevada’s schools,
among many other critical reforms.
We honor David Parks today as he
concludes his final legislative session
in the Nevada State Senate and leaves
behind a legacy of progressive change
and a deep commitment to public serv-
ice.∑

RECOGNIZING ROYAL FURNITURE
AND DESIGN
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as chair-
man of the Senate Committee on Small
Business and Entrepreneurship, it is
my pleasure to recognize a service-
minded small business. Small busi-
nesses fulfill important needs in our
communities, not only through their
valuable products and services, but
also in their ability to connect with
and assist their fellow neighbors in
times of need. It is my distinct pleas-
ure to name Royal Furniture and De-
sign of the Florida Keys as the Senate
Small Business of the Week.
Founded in 1984, Royal Furniture and
Design has grown from a single retail
store in Marathon, FL, to a full service
home design and remodeling company
with three Keys showrooms and a
warehouse in Florida City. Owned and
operated by the Elwell family, Ross
and Janice own the company, while
their sons Chris and Ryan help to man-
age the Key West and Marathon stores.
Today, Royal Furniture and Design
employs 40 full-time workers. The
Elwell family has long-standing,
generational ties with the Keys com-
munity as their family has been small
business owners in Marathon since
1959.
For decades, the Elwell’s have been
incredible philanthropists. Following

the devastation of Hurricane Irma,
Royal Furniture and Design set up
tents in their parking lot and fed mem-
bers of the community every day for a
month. Immediately following the hur-
ricane, they donated space in their
former Marathon location to the Amer-
ican Legion to store emergency relief
and water supplies. In collaboration
with other local organizations, they
helped 48 families who were severely
impacted by the storm with free,
brand-new furniture.
Royal Furniture and Design is an
outstanding example of the charitable
services that small businesses offer our
communities throughout Florida. They
continue to host charity cooking
events throughout the Keys in addition
to their Mardi Gras masquerade ball to
benefit the Fishermen’s Community
Hospital. In 2018, Royal Furniture and
Design was recognized as both the Best
Family Owned Business and Best Busi-
ness by Marathon Rotary Club and the
Marathon Weekly Newspaper. Members
of the Marathon community voted on
these awards and ultimately chose
Royal Furniture and Design for their
dedication to customer service.
Royal Furniture and Design and the
entire Elwell family are an outstanding
example of the American entrepre-
neurial spirit. They continue to go
above and beyond to serve the Keys
community while treating each cus-
tomer like family. It is my pleasure to
be able to recognize the Elwell family
and the entire team at Royal Furniture
and Design as the Senate Small Busi-
ness of the Week.
Congratulations, thank you for your
service to Floridians, and I look for-
ward to watching your continued serv-
ice and success.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and
were referred or ordered to lie on the
table as indicated:
POM–73. A resolution adopted by the House
of Delegates of the State of West Virginia
memorializing its support of ongoing and
continued development of West Virginia’s
energy resources, pipeline, and energy infra-
structure; to the Committee on Energy and
Natural Resources.
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 6
Whereas, West Virginia’s natural gas and
energy reserves and production have in-
creased significantly in recent years due to
the exploration occurring in the Utica and
Marcellus Shale formations; and
Whereas, West Virginia is now the ninth-
largest natural gas producing state in the
nation, providing five percent of our coun-
try’s total energy; and
Whereas, The natural gas and oil industry
supported over 70,000 jobs both directly and
indirectly and added $8 billion to the West
Virginian economy; and
Whereas, Pipelines and transmission lines
serve a critical role in delivering natural
gas, petroleum, and electricity in order to
meet our growing energy needs; and
Whereas, Denying the expansion and con-
struction of existing and new pipeline
projects would stop the significant revital-
ization of communities and manufacturing
industries in West Virginia; and
Whereas, The U.S. Department of Energy
has identified the benefits that West Vir-
ginia can accrue with the establishment of
an ethane storage and distribution hub to
promote diversity of supply and geography,
alleviating the strategic risk our country
faces as a result of a lack of redundancy and
flexibility; and
Whereas, West Virginia is business friendly
and welcomes investments in the state and
local economy; and
Whereas, West Virginia’s neighbors, in-
cluding Ohio and Pennsylvania, have bene-
fitted from using natural gas to attract in-
dustry; and
Whereas, The natural gas intensive indus-
try sector in Ohio has an output of $160 bil-
lion and Pennsylvania has an output of $156
billion in comparison to West Virginia’s out-
put of $18 billion; and
Whereas, Ohio and Pennsylvania have over
300,000 jobs in natural gas intensive industry
sector while West Virginia has over 30,000
jobs in the natural gas intensive industry
sector; therefore, be it
Resolved by the House of Delegates, That we,
the members of the House of Delegates of the
84th Legislature of the State of West Vir-
ginia, support the ongoing and continued de-
velopment of West Virginia’s energy re-
sources, pipeline, and energy infrastructure
in the State of West Virginia; and be it fur-
ther
Resolved, That we, the members of the
House of Delegates of the 84th Legislature of
the State of West Virginia, support ongoing
economic development efforts to attract end-
users of electricity and natural gas to ex-
pand our state’s economy and create family
sustaining jobs; and be it further
Resolved, That the Clerk transmit duly au-
thenticated copies of this resolution to the
President of the United States, the President
Pro Tern pore and Secretary of the United
States Senate, the members of the West Vir-
ginia Congressional delegation, and the news
media of West Virginia.
POM–74. A resolution adopted by the House
of Delegates of the State of West Virginia
memorializing its support of the Atlantic
Coast Pipeline; to the Committee on Energy
and Natural Resources.
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 11
Whereas, The Atlantic Coast Pipeline and
others are critical to the economic and en-
ergy future of the State of West Virginia,
providing our state’s natural gas production
with unprecedented access to new markets;
and
Whereas, Studies indicate construction and
operation of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline
alone will generate massive economic bene-
fits for West Virginia, including almost $478
million in additional economic activity dur-
ing the construction period and more than
$15 million in additional economic activity
each year after the facility begins operating;
and
Whereas, The Atlantic Coast Pipeline and
others will create thousands of new job op-
portunities for the working men and women
of West Virginia and significant new tax rev-
enues for many West Virginia counties; and
Whereas, The Atlantic Coast Pipeline and
others will help promote our nation’s energy
independence, helping make the burgeoning
natural gas production in West Virginia and
adjacent states more available to millions of
consumers and reducing the need for energy
imports; and
Whereas, The Atlantic Coast Pipeline’s en-
vironmental impact has been repeatedly and
thoroughly analyzed by state and federal
agencies, including the West Virginia De-
partment of Environmental Protection, the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and
the U.S. Forest Service, among others, with
all of the agencies finding that the project
can be built and operated in a manner that
protects the natural resources of West Vir-
ginia and the other states in its path; and
Whereas, Despite the enormous energy and
economic benefits, as well as the positive
findings from a broad range of environ-
mental regulatory agencies, some groups
have launched an all-out assault on the At-
lantic Coast Pipeline project, with the ulti-
mate aim of forcing its cancelation; and
Whereas, These attacks are not based on
the facts regarding the Atlantic Coast Pipe-
line but are part of what the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce describes as a nationwide ‘‘keep it
in the ground’’ strategy by some groups to
end all uses of fossil fuels in power genera-
tion; and
Whereas, These unwarranted attacks have
resulted in regulatory and legal proceedings
that have repeatedly delayed both the Atlan-
tic Coast Pipeline and the related Supply
Header Project; and
Whereas, In response to court orders stem-
ming from these attacks, the Atlantic Coast
Pipeline and Supply Header Project have
been forced to lay off or delay hiring thou-
sands of skilled construction workers in
West Virginia and also in Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Virginia and North Carolina, posing
significant hardships for working families
and depriving them of paychecks and steady
work; and
Whereas, The U.S. Chamber of Commerce
report estimates that these delays, through
August 2018, have already resulted in the loss
of $2.3 billion in the U.S. Gross Domestic
Product as well as $500 million in lost tax
revenue for U.S. states and localities; and
Whereas, The Chamber’s study also found
that the delays have already deprived U.S.
consumers of $377 million in energy cost sav-
ings; and
Whereas, The General President of the La-
borers’ International Union of North Amer-
ica (LIUNA) recently said obstructions to
the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and other vital
energy infrastructure ‘‘from activist groups
is costing our members jobs and the entire
country opportunities’’; and
Whereas, The LIUNA General President
also emphasized that the economic damage
caused by this opposition to new energy
projects is ‘‘being shouldered by the hard
working men and women who build our na-
tion’s energy infrastructure’’; and
Whereas, These assaults and delaying tac-
tics are also a direct threat to West Vir-
ginia’s energy production industry, which di-
rectly employs more than 22,000 men and
women and pays more than $6 billion in
wages annually; and
Whereas, Although the current employ-
ment and payroll figures are impressive, fur-
ther growth will be severely hampered unless
new infrastructure such as the Atlantic
Coast Pipeline and other pipelines are built
to transport West Virginia’s energy produc-
tion to market; and
Whereas, In addition to this economic
damage, the attacks on the Atlantic Coast
Pipeline and other interstate natural gas
projects have great potential to harm the en-
vironment, since other forms of electric gen-
eration powered by fossil fuels, such as nat-
ural gas, are needed to back up the expan-
sion of the intermittent generation from re-
newable resources such as solar and wind en-
ergy: Therefore, be it
Resolved by the House of Delegates: That we,
the members of the House of Delegates of the
84th Legislature of the State of West Vir-
ginia, categorically condemn these counter-
productive and economically damaging as-
saults on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and
other urgently needed energy infrastructure
projects; and, be it further
Resolved, That we note that these attacks
are denying steady employment and income
to thousands of West Virginia workers and
their families who would otherwise be em-
ployed in the construction and operation of
the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the related
Supply Header Project; and, be it further
Resolved, That we find that the attacks are
also damaging West Virginia’s energy pro-
duction industry, the source of more than $6

billion annually in wages to our state’s
working men and women; and, be it further
Resolved, That we find that the assaults on
these projects have great potential to dam-
age the environment by hindering the de-
ployment of electric generation powered by
solar power, wind and other renewable re-
sources, all of which must be backed up with
fossil fuel powered generation, such as nat-
ural gas; and, be it further
Resolved, That we strongly urge the groups
spearheading these assaults to stop their at-
tacks and delaying actions and in the proc-
ess help pave the way for a cleaner and
stronger energy future for West Virginia and
for the entire nation; and, be it further
Resolved, That the Clerk transmit copies of
this resolution to the President of the
United States, the President Pro Tempore
and Secretary of the United States Senate,
the members of the West Virginia Congres-
sional delegation, and the news media of
West Virginia.

HONORING CYNTHIA MILLER
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, it is with
great pleasure that I recognize a dear friend
and former long-time member of my staff, Ms.
Cynthia Miller. Every Member of Congress
knows they are only as good as the staff that
surround them. I was very fortunate to have
Cynthia standing with me for many years.
Cynthia was born in Harlem, New York but
was raised in the Bronx. She attended schools
in the Bronx and graduated from Theodore
Roosevelt High School in 1971.
Cynthia’s first job came in that same year,
1971, with Metropolitan Life, where she
worked for 14 years. In 1973 she married
Keith Miller and moved to Mount Vernon, New
York. She then moved to Yonkers in 1981 to
raise her three children, and she has been liv-
ing there for the last 38 years.
I first got to know Cynthia some 24 years
ago. She had been volunteering with Mary
Gaines at the Nepperhan Community Center,
dealing with children in the after-school pro-
gram. With Mary’s influence, I hired Cynthia
as an Assistant Aide to help lead my team in
Westchester.
Cynthia’s work mainly focused on helping
constituents with federal issues and problems.
And help she did. Thousands of people over
the course of two and a half decades were
aided by Cynthia Miller, with problems ranging
from immigration to Social Security and every-
thing in between. In addition to her work in my
office, Cynthia was also an active member in
several community groups, including the Black
Women’s Political Caucus, Aquehung Wom-
en’s Democratic Club and the Focus Group.
After recently retiring, Cynthia is now enjoy-
ing her volunteer work more than ever and
loves traveling. This year, the Hudson River
Community Association is honoring Cynthia at
their annual Spring Dinner. Perhaps I’m a bit
partial, but I don’t believe they could have
found a better honoree. Congratulations to
Cynthia, and I thank her for her years of serv-
ice to the community.

IN HONOR OF RETIRING SAN
FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY
PRESIDENT LES WONG
HON. JACKIE SPEIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to celebrate Dr. Leslie Wong, the retiring
President of San Francisco State University.
Dr. Wong leaves San Francisco State after
seven fruitful years, and it is a stronger, bolder
university due to his leadership.
Dr. Wong’s calm and effective manner, his
warm smile and enthusiasm won me over the
first time I met him. We compared notes about
the Upper Peninsula where he had just moved
from as the President of the Northern Michi-
gan University. Mind you, NMU is in Mar-
quette, a town of 35,000 mostly white people.
His new home, SFSU, is in San Francisco,
one of the most diverse cities of 880,000 peo-
ple. He immediately adapted and became part
of the fabric of the school and community.
San Francisco State is an urban jewel lo-
cated in my Congressional District. Its grad-
uates fill the ranks of the state’s leadership cir-
cles, and its 130+ academic areas, 27 creden-
tial programs, multiple certificate, master’s de-
gree and doctoral degree programs fuel the
regional economy. It is also the home of a
multi-cultural student body from around the
globe. If you go to San Francisco State, you
will receive a world-class education simply by
listening to debates in the public areas of the
campus or attending one of the many political,
cultural and civic affairs programs held annu-
ally.
It was into this mix of diversity and activism
that Dr. Wong walked when he assumed lead-
ership of San Francisco State in 2012 as its
13th President. He came from Northern Michi-
gan University, where he also served as Presi-
dent from 2004 to 2012. Earlier, he held a va-
riety of leadership posts at universities in
North Dakota, Colorado, and Washington
State.
He was successful in raising scholarship
funds, renovating the San Francisco State
gym, and building the Mashouf Wellness Cen-
ter. At present, the university is also building
the new Liberal and Creative Arts Building, the
first new academic building on campus in a
generation. Dr. Wong was instrumental in
bringing the Holloway Mixed-Use Project to
fruition to provide for more student housing
and to provide for street-level businesses.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E692 June 3, 2019
During his tenure, the six year graduation
rates for black and Latino students increased.
Also during his leadership, San Francisco
State was designated a Hispanic Serving Insti-
tution and is recognized as an Asian Amer-
ican, Native American, and Pacific Islander
Serving Institution. It is a little-known fact that
the school’s faculty and students regularly dis-
cover new planets. This is the kind of inquiry
that Les Wong inspires throughout the univer-
sity.
No university worth the title, however, is for-
ever without controversy. In the rich tradition
of San Francisco State, Dr. Wong listened to
faculty, students and to other stakeholders.
His thoughtful dialogues assured the San
Francisco State community that the beliefs of
all would be listened to and addressed, if pos-
sible.
Dr. Wong serves on multiple academic as-
sociation boards, including the Board of Direc-
tors of the Association of American Colleges
and Universities, the San Francisco Chamber
of Commerce, the Bay Area Council and the
National Collegiate Athletics Association Board
of Governors Committee to Promote Cultural
Diversity and Equity. He’s received numerous
national and community awards including the
2014 Asian Pacific Americans in Higher Edu-
cation President’s award for Leadership and
Contributions in Higher Education.
With his wife, Phyllis, Dr. Wong has three
sons and eight grandchildren. He now will step
down after 46 years in academia and become
grandpa, perhaps his most challenging posi-
tion yet.
Madam Speaker, San Francisco State was
first established in 1899. Since its founding as
a school to educate future public school teach-
ers, the university has branched out into
science, engineering, business, and the liberal
arts and humanities, in addition to education.
Each year, it currently graduates 8,000 stu-
dents, a number so large that, when coupled
with parents, friends and other loved ones, ne-
cessitates a graduation ceremony in the park
where the San Francisco Giants play ball.
For those of us who know and love the uni-
versity, it comes as no surprise that its depart-
ing President came to this university as the
final stop along his professional career. When
the M Ocean View next stops at Holloway and
19th Avenue, its passengers will eagerly dis-
embark in order to enter the hallways of a fine
university made stronger by the leadership of
this man.
Thus, we celebrate the irony: One man’s
final professional stop on a life’s journey is the
next generation’s early stop in pursuit of pro-
fessional and personal dreams. In his depar-
ture, let us salute Leslie E. Wong, PhD. He
has been a faithful steward of the phenomenal
dream machine known as San Francisco State
University. Ultimately, it fulfilled his dreams
and those of its students. He is a fortunate
man, and we wish him well in the years
ahead.

RECOGNIZING CATHY HUGHES
HON. JAMIE RASKIN
OF MARYLAND
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Cathy Hughes, who was recently
inducted into the National Association of
Broadcasters Hall of Fame, making her the
first African American woman to receive that
honor. Cathy’s world-famous business, Radio
One (now Urban One), is headquartered in my
district, in Silver Spring, Maryland, and I am
very proud of her and the more than 1,000
people employed there by Urban One.
Cathy began her radio career at KOWH–AM
in her hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. In
1971, she became a lecturer at the newly es-
tablished School of Communications at How-
ard University, and served as general sales
manager at WHUR, Howard University Radio.
She also became the first female Vice
President and General Manager of a station in
the Nation’s Capital and pioneered the format
known as the ‘‘Quiet Storm,’’ which aired on
more than 480 stations nationwide. In 1980,
Cathy purchased her flagship station WOL–
AM, in Washington, D.C., and pioneered yet
another innovative format—‘‘24-Hour Talk from
a Black Perspective.’’ With the theme, ‘‘Infor-
mation is Power,’’ she served as the station’s
morning show host for 11 years.
In 1999, Cathy became the first African-
American woman to chair a publicly-held cor-
poration. Along with her son and business
partner, she grew what was then Radio One
into a multi-media company that became an
urban radio market leader with more than 60
stations across the country. It became the first
African-American company in radio history to
dominate several major markets simulta-
neously, and Cathy became the first woman to
own a radio station that was ranked number
one in a major market.
I commend Cathy Hughes for her pioneering
contributions over the course of her career
and congratulate her on her induction into the
National Association of Broadcasters’ Broad-
casting Hall of Fame.

HONORING GREG MOORE
HON. JARED HUFFMAN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today, along with Speaker NANCY PELOSI and
Representative JACKIE SPEIER, to recognize
Greg Moore, an extraordinary park advocate
and community leader who has served as
President and CEO of the Golden Gate Na-
tional Parks Conservancy (GGNPC) for over
three decades.
A native of San Francisco, Greg graduated
from the University of California, Berkeley,
with a Bachelor of Science degree in Con-
servation of Natural Resources, and he later
earned a mid-career fellowship in Environ-
mental Planning from the University of Wash-
ington. Greg spent his early career in a variety
of planning and management roles with the
National Parks Service and other conserva-
tion-focused public agencies before becoming
the chief operating officer of GGNPC in 1985.
A non-profit membership organization,
GGNPC was founded in 1981 to help preserve
the now 37 distinct park sites and 80,000
acres that comprise Golden Gate National
Parks and to ensure universal access to them.
Over the course of Greg’s 34-year tenure,
GGNPC has become one of the most suc-
cessful organizations of its kind, having re-
cruited and managed over 250,000 volunteers,
restored over 130 miles of trails, preserved
700 historic structures, developed innovative
stewardship and education programs, and pro-
vided over half a billion dollars in contributions
for park programs and projects.
A large part of this success is due to Greg’s
ability to build relationships within and outside
the parks’ community. These relationships
have led to numerous cross-sector collabora-
tions, community-led stewardship programs,
and successful philanthropic campaigns that
fostered greater access and support for the
Golden Gate National Parks. The post-to-park
conversion of Fort Baker, the Presidio of San
Francisco, and Crissy Field are all examples
of this. Greg played a catalytic role in these lo-
cations, transforming decommissioned military
facilities into iconic destinations of the Golden
Gate National Recreation Area.
Madam Speaker, Greg Moore’s leadership
has been integral in preserving a collection of
parks that are unparalleled in the National
Park System. With a combined volume of
yearly visitors that outstrips Yosemite, Yellow-
stone, Grand Canyon, and Olympic National
Parks put together, Golden Gate National
Recreation Area has continued to thrive in part
because of the program support and culture of
stewardship that has been fostered under
Greg’s leadership. Therefore, please join us in
honoring Greg Moore as he steps away from
his leadership role and in wishing him success
on his future endeavors.

COMMENDING MR. ELVIN COSBY’S
73 YEARS OF SERVICE TO
HENRICO COUNTY, VIRGINIA
HON. ABIGAIL DAVIS SPANBERGER
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Mr. Elvin Cosby on his retire-
ment from Henrico County Government after
73 years of service.
Mr. Cosby began serving the Henrico De-
partment of Public Works in April of 1946. He
began his career in public service carrying
water to county work crews and has also
served as a truck driver, equipment operator,
and county foreman. Most recently, Mr. Cosby
acted as a maintenance supervisor and
cleared debris from Henrico’s roads.
Mr. Cosby has diligently served the public
through each and every one of his functions
within Henrico County Govemment. In addition
to his tireless work ethic, members of the
community have also praised Mr. Cosby for
promoting diversity and symbolizing selfless-
ness. As a fellow public servant, I am humbled
and moved by his dedication to serve Vir-
ginia’s 7th District.
Although I know he will be dearly missed by
mentees, colleagues, and friends at the De-
partment of Public Works, I hope Mr. Cosby
will enjoy getting to spend more time with his
wife and grandchildren. After seven decades
of working on others’ behalves, I cannot think
of many more deserving of a blissful and re-
laxing retirement.
Madam Speaker, please join me in com-
mending Mr. Cosby for his unwavering com-
mitment to improving our community.

Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize Judge Holly Williamson, Harris
County Justice of the Peace for Precinct 8,
Place 1, on being named the 2018 Judge of
the Year by the Justices of the Peace and
Constables Association of Texas.
Judge Holly Williamson took the oath of of-
fice as Presiding Judge of Harris County Jus-

load of approximately 20,000 cases a year
that include: civil and criminal trials, jury and
bench trials, traffic court, hot checks, evictions,
probable cause hearings, administrative hear-
ings, and truancy court.
From 2009 to 2015, Judge Williamson
served as the Co-Presiding Judge for the 16
Justice Courts of Harris County. Judge
Williamson is involved in many professional
organizations as a volunteer or presenter in-
cluding the Texas Justice Court Training Cen-
ter (TJCTC) Education Committee. She is re-
sponsible for developing and implementing

mending a uniform truancy policy for the
school districts of Harris County.

CONGRATULATING THE
KEWEENAW LAND TRUST FOR
RECEIVING LAND TRUST AC-
CREDITATION
HON. JACK BERGMAN
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it’s my
honor to recognize the Keweenaw Land Trust
for receiving Land Trust Accreditation.
Through its dedication to wildlife habitat, out-
door recreation, and its local community, the
Keweenaw Land Trust has become an indis-
pensable part of Michigan’s First District.
Locally focused land conservation under-
taken by community-based land trusts has be-
come increasingly important across the coun-
try. Accreditation by the independent Land
Trust Accreditation Commission is given to
those organizations that have proven to be
trusted, strong, and effective in their land con-
servation efforts. Through its tremendous work
in Michigan, the Keweenaw Land Trust has
shown that it is more than deserving of this
seal. First started in 1996, the organization
protects thousands of acres of forest and wet-
lands in the Keweenaw Peninsula and
throughout the Western Upper Peninsula. Its
work to protect wildlife habitats, water quality,
working farms and ranches, and healthy com-
munities has been invaluable for the people of
Michigan’s First District. Our region is home to
some of the most pristine natural landscapes
in the country, and I’m grateful for the
Keweenaw Land Trust’s efforts to ensure that
future generations can enjoy the same natural
beauty we so deeply treasure.
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to congratu-
late the Keweenaw Land Trust for receiving
Land Trust Accreditation. Michiganders can
take immense pride in knowing that the First
District is home to such a trusted organization
working to promote land conservation. On be-
half of my constituents, I wish the Keweenaw
Land Trust all the best in its future endeavors.

TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF JUDGE
WILEY DANIEL
HON. DIANA DeGETTE
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the life and achievements
of Judge Wiley Daniel, the first African Amer-
ican judge appointed to the U.S. District Court
for Colorado, who recently passed away on
Friday, May 10, 2019.
Judge Daniel was born in 1946 in Louisville,
Kentucky and received his undergraduate and
law degrees from Howard University in Wash-
ington, D.C. He spent six years in private
practice in Detroit before moving to Denver in
1977 where he practiced law for 24 years with
a specialty in civil litigation.
In 1992, he rose to be the first—and only—
African American president of the Colorado
Bar Association. Three years later, President
Bill Clinton appointed Mr. Daniel to the U.S.
District Court for Colorado, becoming the first
African American federal judge in the state.
Thirteen years after Judge Daniel took the
bench, he became chief judge of the court.
Judge Daniel served admirably both inside
and outside of the courtroom. He served as
President of the Federal Judges Association, a
national organization that supports hundreds
of federal judges. He also taught courses in
trial advocacy as an adjunct professor at the
University of Colorado Law School and the
University of Denver Sturm College of Law,
where he mentored students. Additionally,
from 1998 to 2003, Judge Daniel was a Trust-
ee of the American Inns of Court Foundation,
an organization which advocates for profes-
sionalism, ethics, civility and excellence
throughout the legal profession. Until his final
days, Judge Daniel was active in his church—
Park Hill United Methodist in north Denver—
where he served as a Deacon, sang in the
choir and mentored young members.
Judge Daniel believed that racial and gen-
der diversity in the judiciary is important. Ac-
cordingly, he was active in the Delta Eta Boulé
fraternity, the nation’s first African American
professional organization. In fact, one of Dan-
iel’s passions was the fraternity’s scholarship
program, which helps young, bright African
American students in the metro Denver area
attend college.
Judge Daniel retired in 2013 but continued
to hear cases and guide younger lawyers. Not
surprisingly, Judge Daniel’s distinguished legal
career and dedication to the community has
been recognized many times with numerous
awards and accolades. In 2006, Judge Daniel
was honored with the American Inns of Court
Foundation Professionalism Award for the
Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2012, he
was inducted to the Blacks in Colorado Hall of
Fame due to his pioneering professional
achievements. In 2013, Judge Daniel was
awarded the King Trimble Lifetime Achieve-
ment Award by the Sam Cary Bar Association.
In 2015, Judge Daniel was selected as the re-
cipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award by
the Center for Legal Inclusiveness in recogni-
tion of his lifelong commitment to diversity and
inclusiveness within the legal profession. Fi-
nally, in 2018, the National Black Prosecutors
Association presented Daniel with the Trail-
blazer Award.
On May 10, 2019, at the age of 72, Judge
Wiley Daniel passed away. He was one of the
trailblazing Coloradoans whose hands have
shaped the United States into the great nation
it is today. He was principled, pragmatic, well-
respected and beloved. That is why his legacy
will live on for many decades to come.
My heartfelt condolences go out to his fam-
ily, the Denver law community and all Colo-
radoans who mourn this terrible loss.

IN HONOR OF EDUARDO PADRON
HON. DONNA E. SHALALA
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize my dear friend, Eduardo Padron, on
the occasion of his retirement as President of
Miami-Dade College and his brilliant service to
the South Florida community.
Dr. Padron has spent his career giving back
to the community that welcomed him when he
arrived from Cuba as a child. In the 50 years
he has spent at Miami-Dade College, as a stu-
dent, professor, and President, he has fun-
damentally transformed the school into an
internationally recognized institution of higher
education. Under his leadership, Miami-Dade
College has become a true center of commu-
nity for South Florida. The college has edu-
cated thousands of students in South Florida
and sent them on to successful careers and
lives.
Dr. Padron has received numerous acco-
lades for his work as an educator. He was in-
cluded in TIME magazine’s list of top ten col-
lege presidents in 2009, named Floridian of
the Year by Florida Trend in 2010, and hon-
ored as one of the eight most influential col-
lege presidents in the U.S. by The Washington
Post in 2011. In 2016, President Barack
Obama awarded him with a Presidential Medal
of Freedom in recognition of his leadership on
access and inclusion in higher education.
We have all witnessed Dr. Padron’s extraor-
dinary dedication to the people of South Flor-
ida. I’m grateful to know him as a leader in
education and as a friend, and I wish him all
the best in his retirement.

CELEBRATING AMAZON’S 20TH
YEAR OF OPERATIONS AT THE

Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to join my constituents in Campbellsville, Ken-
tucky, who are celebrating Amazon’s 20th
year of operations at the SDF1 Fulfillment
Center.
Amazon has been a tremendous contributor
to Taylor County and the surrounding areas
since opening SDF1 as one of the first five ful-
fillment centers in North America. Over the
past two decades, Amazon has grown tremen-
dously and SDF1 remains one of the largest
employers in Taylor County and the region.
As evidence of the company’s commitment
to bettering the communities in which they op-
erate, and in commemoration of their 20th
year in Campbellsville, Amazon is donating
more than $10,000 in STEM-related supplies
to the Taylor County Public Library. This dona-
tion will enhance the library’s current STEM-
themed programs by fostering and promoting
the pursuit of STEM education, while also de-
veloping students with real-world, marketable
skills.
For two decades, Amazon has been proud
to call Kentucky home and I am grateful for
their continued investment in our common-
wealth. I am proud of the economic prosperity
and industrial development their presence has
brought to Taylor County, and I join with all
those whose lives they have bettered in cele-
brating their generosity to the community.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT
OF T.J. MCGRATH AFTER NEAR-
LY 27 YEARS OF DISTINGUISHED
CIVILIAN SERVICE
HON. JOHN A. YARMUTH
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor and recognize the outstanding
service of T.J. McGrath on her retirement after
nearly 27 years of distinguished public service,
the past 10 years at the Congressional Budget
Office, most recently as its General Counsel.
T.J. was promoted to that position in late
2016, in recognition of her dedication, ability,
skillful work, and breadth of experience. In that
capacity, she has served as CBO’s principal
legal officer and an integral part of the agen-
cy’s leadership team. She has overseen
CBO’s legal staff and their work, skillfully lead-
ing them in interpreting legislative proposals
and providing high-level analysis regarding
significant judicial decisions, scorekeeping
guidelines, and relevant budget laws. She has
been a leader in making CBO’s analysis more
transparent.
Moreover, since becoming CBO’s General
Counsel, she has worked tirelessly, building
professional relationships across the legisla-
tive branch, focusing on creating a positive
work environment at CBO, and providing train-
ing so that employees have the skills they
need to interact more effectively. One example
that encapsulates all three of those efforts is
bystander training. T.J. worked closely with
the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights
to develop training to prevent harassment in
the workplace. The training provided partici-
pants with practical tools for taking ownership
of their work environment and encouraged by-
standers not to remain silent if they witness an
incident that might make someone feel un-
comfortable. As a result of T.J.’s efforts, CBO
was the first agency in the legislative branch
to receive bystander training.
From 2009 to 2016, T.J. served as CBO’s
Deputy General Counsel. In that position, she
dealt with many operational matters and quick-
ly demonstrated her ability to develop practical
solutions. She instituted CBO’s successful
legal intern program, updated and refined
CBO’s internal policies, served as lead attor-
ney in cases involving the Congressional Ac-
countability Act, and worked closely with a
Justice Department attorney in a case brought
in U.S. District Court. T.J. also made valuable

contributions to numerous reports, testimonies,
and cost estimates in just about every subject
area covered by CBO, including the economy,
national security, and health care.
T.J.’s service to the nation did not begin
with her work at CBO. She came to CBO from
the Defense Department’s TRICARE Manage-
ment Activity (now the Defense Health Agen-
cy), where she was an Associate General
Counsel, providing guidance to the Director
and staff on policy and legal issues involved in
delivering quality health care to military per-
sonnel, military retirees, and their dependents.
Although T.J. is retiring from civilian service,
she will continue her exemplary military ca-
reer. For nearly 27 years, she has served as
a member of the Air Force’s Judge Advocate
General Corps. She first served on active duty
in various locations, including Alaska, Korea,
Germany, Iraq, and Afghanistan. During that
time, T.J. defended the Air Force against tort
claims, prosecuted criminal offenses, taught at
the U.S. Air Force Academy, commanded a
cadet squadron, and was a military assistant
to the General Counsel of the Department of
Defense. Since transferring to the reserves
more than 14 years ago, she has served in
the North American Aerospace Defense Com-
mand and United States Northern Command,
the Air Force Space Command, the Air Force
Nuclear Weapons Center, and the Pacific Air
Forces. She remains active as a colonel in the
selected reserves today.
Her colleagues in CBO and on the Hill ap-
preciate her hard work, keen insights, sense
of humor, and steady hand. They will espe-
cially miss her generosity with her time and
knowledge, her patience, and especially her
kindness.
I know my colleagues join me in extending
our thanks and appreciation to T.J. for her
service to our country. We wish her well in her
future undertakings and hope that the nation
will continue to benefit from her expertise and
commitment.

HONORING THE 25TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE METROPOLITAN
AREA AGENCY ON AGING
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM
OF MINNESOTA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the 25th anniversary of the
Metropolitan Area Agency on Aging (MAAA).
For 25 years, this nonprofit organization has
served as a trusted advocate and resource for
older adults and caregivers in the Twin Cities
seven-county metropolitan area, helping sen-
iors age well in their homes and communities.
As part of the history of the Older Ameri-
cans Act, in 1972, the Metropolitan Council
was designated the first Area Agency on
Aging (AAA) for the Twin Cities metro area.
MAAA was founded in 1994 as an inde-
pendent, nonprofit organization and des-
ignated the AAA to carry out Older Americans
Act services and programs. In 1997, Senior
LinkAge Line call centers were established at
MAAA and AAAs across Minnesota. In 2000,
the National Family Caregiver Support was
enacted by Congress and in 2001, MAAA es-
tablished the Metropolitan Caregiver Service
Collaborative. In 2004, it launched Sustaining
Minority Elders in Their Communities—an ini-
tiative to provide technical assistance and
funding for organizations serving minority el-
ders. The Upper Midwest Pension Rights
Project became part of MAAA in 2009. It pro-
vides free legal counseling to residents of Min-
nesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, North Dakota, and
South Dakota who have questions or prob-
lems related to their pensions. In 2011, MAAA
became the fiscal sponsor for ACT on Alz-
heimer’s—a statewide collaboration that began
in Minnesota and led to the creation of a na-
tional initiative—Dementia Friendly America. In
2015, MAAA hosted the regional White House
Conference on Aging.
Over the years, MAAA continues to adapt
and expand the connections, services, and
programs it oversees to better meet the needs
of our aging communities. In 2015, MAAA
founded Innovations for Aging, a wholly owned
nonprofit subsidiary to expand its health pro-
motion and wellness work. In 2016, Juniper
was started in partnership with AAAs across
Minnesota, and with Innovations for Aging as
the managing partner. It provides evidence-
based programming to help adults manage
chronic health conditions, prevent falls, and be
fit. Today, MAAA has grown from a staff of
eight to employing 108 staff and is located in
Arden Hills. In 2018, with Older Americans Act
funding, MAAA and its community-based part-
ners served 24,366 older adults and care-
givers with critical service including chore and
homemaking services, meals, rides, and care-
giver consultation. More than 35 percent of
those served were minority or Native elders.
Through the Senior LinkAge Line and the help
of its volunteers, MAAA served 66,673 people
and answered 43,000 Medicare Open Enroll-
ment calls last year.
Madam Speaker, the steadfast leadership,
unbiased information, and assistance that
MAAA provides to the aging communities in
the Twin Cities metro are commendable and
deserve to be celebrated. Please join me in
honoring the 25th Anniversary of the Metro-
politan Area Agency on Aging.

CONGRATULATING GORDON
HIGGINS ON HIS RETIREMENT
HON. DOUG COLLINS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize Hall County Schools’
spokesman and athletic director Gordon Hig-
gins on his retirement.
Higgins first moved to Hall County in 1980,
starting as a teacher and coach at Johnson
High School in Oakwood, Georgia. Now, at
the age of 71, Higgins is retiring after devoting
47 years of his career to education, 39 of
which he spent working as an administrator,
an educator, and a coach in Hall County.
When Higgins first began teaching in Hall
County in 1980, there were only three high
schools serving a population of approximately
60,000. Over the last five decades, the popu-
lation of Hall County has exploded to over
200,000 people, and there are now eight high
schools across the district. For the last 39
years, Higgins played a critical role in guiding
and shaping the school district through this
season of incredible growth, and he focused
heavily on the fact that with growth comes an
increased need for accountability. He made
continuous efforts to increase the role of ath-
letics in the local community and maintained a
close relationship with local media outlets to
ensure the community stayed informed on any
news coming out of the Hall County School
District, whether positive or negative.
During his tenure, Higgins partnered with
various individuals and organizations for the
betterment of the student body. Within the ath-
letic department, Higgins helped implement
new safety standards for tending to student
athlete injuries by partnering with Dr. John
Vachtsevanos to implement the Immediate
Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive
Testing Program, which has given Hall County
athletics staff the ability to quickly determine
whether a student athlete has suffered from a
concussion and should receive medical atten-
tion.
Higgins also worked tirelessly to help pre-
pare students for the workforce by working
with the Hall County Chamber of Commerce
to create partnerships between Hall County
schools and local businesses to make work-
study programs available to students.
Higgins says what he will miss the most is
the people. The community of students, teach-
ers, and parents he has served mean much to
him and his family, and Higgins certainly
means the world to our community. He has
served our students and our community as a
role model, teacher, administrator, and coach,
and the Hall County School District is forever
better because of his dedication. I want to
thank Gordon Higgins for his commitment to
our students and our community, and I wish
him all the best in his retirement.

RECOGNIZING THE BENJAMIN
MILLS CHAPTER OF THE NA-
TIONAL SOCIETY OF THE
DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN
REVOLUTION
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the Benjamin Mills Chapter of the
National Society of the Daughters of the
American Revolution.
During the Revolutionary War, Benjamin
Mills served as a private and then as a 2nd
lieutenant in the Maryland troops. His wife,
Elizabeth, was also a patriot, having sewn
shirts for the soldiers. After the war, the Mills
family left Maryland to live in Pennsylvania.
The family moved west, settling in Paris, Ken-
tucky where Benjamin, Sr. died in 1822. Son
Andrew and his family then migrated to Illinois
in 1827 and settled in the southern part of
Bond County, where hundreds of their de-
scendants still populate the area.
On June 16, 2019, the Benjamin Mills Chap-
ter, in coordination with the Illinois State Re-
gent, Gloria Perkins Flathom, will dedicate two
official NSDAR plaques in honor of Camp
Ground Cumberland Presbyterian Church and
Old Camp Ground Cemetery.
The Old Camp Ground Cemetery was es-
tablished around 1830. Buried there are Revo-
lutionary War soldier Joseph McAdams, Mary
Trotter Mills, daughter of Revolutionary War

soldier Joseph Trotter, as well as veterans
from the following conflicts: 1812, Black Hawk,
Indian, Mexican, Civil, Spanish, WWI, WWII,
Korea, and Vietnam.
The Camp Ground Cumberland Pres-
byterian Church began as a revival meeting of
local families, and eventually led to the found-
ing of the church at the site circa 1826. The
original church building held worship services
furnished with only the bare necessities, a dirt
floor and a pulpit.
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to recognize
the Benjamin Mills Chapter of the NSDAR as
it dedicates these two plaques. The Chapter
has been active in the Bond County area for
over 100 years, and I wish it the best as it em-
barks on the next 100 years of promoting the
Daughters of the American Revolution motto:
God, Home, and Country.

CELEBRATING THE PRESIDENCY
OF KATHERINE P. DOUGLAS AT
CORNING COMMUNITY COLLEGE
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
celebrate the career of Katherine P. Douglas
at Corning Community College, and congratu-
late her on her retirement.
For the last eight years, Katherine Douglas
has served as the President of Corning Com-
munity College. As the sixth President in the
history of the college, her goal has been to
support the power of learning and improve the
quality of life for students, their families, and
our communities. Through a number of initia-
tives completed by the College throughout her
tenure, Katherine has certainly met that goal.
Under Katherine’s leadership, Corning Com-
munity College has flourished and grown to
meet the needs of changing times. In 2012,
she founded the Presidential Scholars scholar-
ship program to aid exceptional students from
Chemung, Steuben, and Schuyler counties
and ensure they could graduate from Corning
Community College free of tuition debt. Kath-
erine helped transform the campus into a resi-
dential community with the opening of a three-
story residence in 2013, dedicated to the Col-
lege’s first President, William Perry. As the
workforce changed with an increased demand
for healthcare professionals, Katherine em-
braced that change and was instrumental in
the opening of the College’s new state-of-the-
art Health Education Center in 2017.
As Katherine moves forward with the next
chapter of her life, we applaud her dedicated
leadership of Corning Community College, and
we wish her all the best in her retirement.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
celebrate Katherine Douglas and her remark-
able presidency at Corning Community Col-
lege.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 350TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF WOODBRIDGE
TOWNSHIP
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR.
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, it is my
honor to recognize Woodbridge Township on
the 350th anniversary of its founding and join
with its officials and residents in celebration of
this historic milestone.
Woodbridge received its charter on June 1,
1669 by King Charles of England, nearly five
years after its settlement. Its long history has
been marked with notable events, residents
and visitors, including an overnight stop at the
Cross Keys Tavern by George Washington on
his travel from Mount Vernon to New York for
his inauguration.
It has also received several distinctions for
its outstanding growth and community excel-
lence. In 1964, Woodbridge was among only
ten municipalities in the United States to re-
ceive the All American City Award, and in
1966 the township was presented with the
Distinguished Achievement Award in the Na-
tional Cleanest Town Achievement Contest by
First Lady Johnson.
Woodbridge continues to preserve its history
and community atmosphere while embracing
growth. Today, the township is comprised of
the communities of Avenel, Colonia, Fords,
Hopelawn, Iselin, Keasbey, Menlo Park Ter-
race, Port Reading, Sewaren and Woodbridge
and is one of the largest municipalities in New
Jersey, with over 100,000 residents. It is home
to Metropark train station, Woodbridge Center
mall, large corporations and businesses as
well as bustling downtowns. It is also a thriv-
ing arts community, with the Barron Arts Cen-
ter and the Avenel Performing Arts Center,
among others. Its diverse population and dis-
tinct features make Woodbridge a unique and
flourishing town.
In its 350th year, the township is governed
by Mayor John McCormac, Council President
Cory Spillar and council members Kyle Ander-
son, Howie Bauer, Lizbeth DeJesus, Nancy
Drumm, Gregg M. Ficarra, Debbie Meehan,
Virbhadra N. Patel and Brian Small.
Madam Speaker, I sincerely hope that my
colleagues will join me in marking the 350th
anniversary of Woodbridge Township and
celebrating its rich history.
COMMEMORATION OF THE 225TH
ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUND-
ING OF THE ALEXANDRIA LI-
BRARY AND THE 80TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE HISTORIC ROBIN-
SON LIBRARY SIT-IN
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR.
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
commemorate the Alexandria Library, which
has a rich history that spans two centuries.
This year, the library is celebrating its 225th
year as an entity as well as the 80th anniver-
sary of the historic 1939 Library Sit-In.
The Alexandria Library was originally found-
ed on July 24, 1794, by the Alexandria Library
Company, where the Library was established
as a subscription service where members paid
a small fee to use its books, becoming the first
in the state to do so.
Over the years, the Library was housed in
several of the City’s historic buildings such as
the City Hall, Lyceum, the old Firehouse,
Stabler’s Apothecary and United Daughters of
the Confederacy’s Confederate Hall.
The community supported the recovery of
the Library in the aftermath of the Civil War
and the Depression of 1873, and again in the
1890s from the Panic of 1893.
In the 1930s, several groups came together
to form a public library with Dr. Robert Barrett
donating the money to build the Kate Waller
Barrett Library (in honor of his mother), includ-
ing the Alexandria Library Company, who do-
nated the books to create the collection, the
Society of Friends, who donated the land to
build the facility, and the city, which des-
ignated a line item in its budget to ensure op-
erations.
On August 20, 1937, the Kate Waller Barrett
Branch opened to the community, but in con-
formance with the Jim Crow laws, it did not
allow all citizens to use the facility and its re-
sources.
On August 21, 1939, local attorney, Samuel
W. Tucker, and five African-American men
challenged this law with a peaceful protest
wherein the five young men individually en-
tered the library and requested library cards
from Library staff, who denied each request.
Each young man took a book from the
shelves, sat down at a table, and began to
read. Eventually arrested for their act of civil
disobedience, this incident was recognized as
the first library sit-in to occur in the country.
Their actions resulted in the opening of the
Robert H. Robinson Library in 1940, which
served the African-American community be-
fore becoming the City’s Black History Mu-
seum. Each anniversary provides a unique op-
portunity to revisit the history that captures the
essence of the City as it evolved into the thriv-
ing, historical destination it is today.
As the Alexandria Library recognizes and
celebrates its entire past, the good and bad, it
seeks to meet the informational, educational
and recreational needs of the community. The
Alexandria Library of the 21st century provides
residents an opportunity to learn, explore, cre-
ate, and connect, emphasizing that libraries
today continue to function as the people’s uni-
versity and make information and technology
available and accessible to all.
I ask this body to join me in commemorating
the 225th anniversary of the founding of the

HONORING CO-OP CITY LITTLE
LEAGUE 50TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, as a former
resident of Co-op City for many years and an
avid baseball fan, it is my pleasure to recog-
nize the Co-op City Little League which this
season will celebrate its remarkable 50th Anni-
versary.
Founded in 1969, Co-op City Little League
has brought generations of families together
for five decades, while providing children with
great exercise and wonderful team building
skills. In the early days, games were played at
Pelham Bay Park, Haffen Field, and Seton
Falls Park. In 1975, a plan was drawn up be-
tween New York City and the Co-op City man-
ager, Riverbay Corporation, for the creation of
the Co-op City Fields. The fields stand on the
outskirts of the residential area, at the inter-
section of Co-op City Boulevard and Bellamy
Loop, and consist of a pair of excellently main-
tained baseball diamonds. Both of the fenced
fields contain dugouts and there is a walkway
with bleachers, a small picnic area, and a
comfort station for spectators.
Co-op City Little League began playing on
the new fields several years after they were
developed and have been going strong there
ever since. The League has served as a
launching pad for several professional players
and has had over 25 District 22 champions
over the years. In 1987, the District 22 cham-
pionship team, coached by Bruce Lasky,
made it all the way to the state championship
game.
Madam Speaker, Co-op City Little League
has been a staple in the community for almost
as long as Co-op City has existed. Thousands
of children and their families have enjoyed a
day at the ballpark thanks to this wonderful,
well run league, and I want to congratulate all
involved on 50 great years. Here’s to 50 more.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. JOHN
DAVID CHANDLER
HON. BRIAN BABIN
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life of my good friend, and fellow
dentist, Dr. John David Chandler of Kerrville
who passed away on May 15, 2019 in San
Antonio.
Dr. Chandler was born on September 7,
1947 in Victoria, Texas and graduated from
Victoria High School in 1965. He earned a
bachelor’s degree in biology from Sam Hous-
ton State in 1969 and a doctorate in dentistry
from the University of Texas Dental Branch in
1973.
Following dental school, Chandler served as
an officer in the United States Air Force Den-
tal Corps at Yokoga Air Force Base from 1973
to 1976. For the next year Dr. Chandler
served as an Associate Professor at the Uni-
versity of Texas Dental Branch. In 1977, Dr.
Chandler moved to Huntsville and started his
private dental practice. Chandler practiced for
38 years in Huntsville, Texas from where he
was recognized as an outstanding restorative
general dentist and was beloved by his pa-
tients, friends and his peers. John and his
wife, Janie, retired in 2015 and moved to
Kerrville, Texas where their love for the out-
doors led them to create a backyard sanctuary
for birds, butterflies and other wildlife.
Dr. Chandler had a passion for continued
education and teaching and mentoring young
dentists. He served in a leadership role in nu-
merous state and national professional organi-
zations such as the Academy of General Den-
tistry, Texas Academy of General Dentistry,
American Dental Association, Brazos Valley
District Dental Society, and the Heart of Texas
Dental Society.
Dr. John David Chandler leaves behind his
loving wife of forty-nine years and eleven
months, nearly half a century. John is also
survived by his son Ty Scott Chandler of Aus-
tin, son Ryan Todd Chandler of Amarillo,
brother and sister-in-law Jay and Ann Garner
of Laguna Vista, and sister, Brenda Anderson
of Austin.
Madam Speaker, my prayers and condo-
lences are with the family and friends of Dr.
Chandler.

COMMEMORATING THE 101ST
ANNIVERSITY OF THE FOUNDING
OF AZERBAIJAN
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, last
week, our friends in Azerbaijan celebrated Re-
public Day, honoring the 101st anniversary of
the founding of their country.
On May 28, 1918, the National Assembly of
Azerbaijan adopted a Declaration of Independ-
ence, and formed the Azerbaijan Democratic
Republic, the first secular parliamentary de-
mocracy in the Muslim world.
In 1920, the Bolsheviks invaded the Azer-
baijan Democratic Republic and established a
Soviet government. Azerbaijan was forcefully
incorporated into the USSR and suffered
under the weight of the Soviet regime for
many decades.
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union,
the Republic of Azerbaijan restored its inde-
pendence on August 30, 1991.
The United States recognized Azerbaijan as
an independent state on December 25, 1991
and established official diplomatic relations
with the Republic of Azerbaijan on February
19, 1992.
As they rebuilt from the wreckage of the
failed communist empire, Azerbaijan grew into
a strong and reliable ally of the United States.
Today, the Republic of Azerbaijan is not
only a valuable partner of the United States,
but also plays a critical role in the Caucasus
and Central Asia. Azerbaijan was one of the
first countries to render unconditional assist-
ance to the United States after the terror at-
tacks of September 11, 2001. It also has a
strong friendship and partnership with Israel,
one of the closest allies of the United States.
Azerbaijan, as a participant in the North At-
lantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) Partner-
ship for Peace program, has supported
NATO’s peace operations in Afghanistan by
providing troops from the Armed Forces of
Azerbaijan to assist with the missions since
2002.
As we commemorate this 101st anniversary
of the founding of Azerbaijan, the United
States remains grateful for the strategic rela-
tionship and enduring friendship between our
two countries. Furthermore, we look forward to
this strong and close friendship continuing and
even growing stronger in the many years to
come.

RICHARD MAXSON UKULELE
CHAMPION
HON. BILLY LONG
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
celebrate Richard Maxson, a professor at
Drury University in Springfield, Missouri, for
winning the 8th Annual International Ukulele
Contest in Honolulu, Hawaii.
Richard spent his youth performing in his
hometown of Ventura, California, and working
at Christian summer camps by providing the
musical soundtracks to sing-alongs and serv-
ices.
Little did he know where these experiences
would take him.
In 2007, Richard was on a business trip in
Hawaii when he came across a sign for free
ukulele lessons. Curious to see if he had what
it took, Richard signed up and learned his first
song: Little Red Hibiscus. Inspired by this,
Richard returned to Springfield, bought his first
ukulele and became what he refers to as a re-
covering guitar player.
As much fun as Richard was having, he
wanted others to join in on the fun. That’s why
in 2012 he formed a ukulele club at Drury Uni-
versity, called the DUkes. His goal was to at-
tract Drury students by sitting in a coffee shop
playing his ukulele. It worked. By 2013, 20
students joined the club and were drinking cof-
fee and playing the ukulele with him.
Over the next few years, the DUkes, under
the direction of Richard, performed at various
events in Springfield. In August 2015, the
DUkes traveled to Springfield’s Sister City of
lsesaki, Japan, to perform at the Isesaki Sum-
mer Festival. Richard also began performing
with his wife, Karen, in a ukulele duo called
Uke 66, performing in the United States, Mex-
ico and Japan. On a whim, Richard entered
the 8th Annual International Ukulele Contest in
Honolulu in 2019. As the only contestant from
the mainland United States, Richard was one
of six finalists in his division of 19 and older.
A few hundred people watched Richard on his
way to victory as he performed an original
piece, titled ‘‘Hedgehog Café,’’ which was in-
spired by a trip he took to Japan with his wife
in 2017.
Madam Speaker, the world needs dedicated
individuals who are eager to share their gifts
with those around them, and that is exactly
what Richard has done and continues to do.
That is why it is my great honor to rise today
congratulating Richard Maxson on his award-
winning performance and original composition.

ARNOLD’S FAITHFUL SERVICE
HON. MARK E. GREEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, in 2006, Sgt. Paul Arnold received his first
cancer diagnosis. But after 26 years in law en-
forcement—13 years with the Franklin Police
Department—Sgt. Arnold would not surrender
his post. For 13 more years, he has continued
to serve his community and act as a bulwark
against crime. Many consider Arnold a mentor,
and all know him to be an example of char-
acter and honor. His reputation is known far
and wide. In 2017, Sgt. Arnold was acknowl-
edged for distinguished service and given the
Theodore Roosevelt Police Award—an award
given to outstanding officers that serve in spite
of a serious illness.
Sgt. Arnold is soon retiring as a Franklin Po-
lice Officer. The Franklin Police Department
will miss this servant leader—but we are
grateful for all Sgt. Arnold has done to build
strong young men who will carry on the torch
of service in their community.
Too often everyday acts of bravery go unno-
ticed and our civil servants unacknowledged,
so it is my honor to thank Sgt. Arnold on be-
half of all Tennesseans for his courage, dedi-
cation, and service.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO WRITER
TONY HORWITZ
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to pay tribute to Pulitzer Prize-winning author
Tony Horwitz who died last week at the age
of 60. His 1998 Confederates in the Attic: Dis-
patches From the Unfinished Civil War was
hugely influential on me because, having
grown up in the South, I could relate to much
of what he wrote. His views on civil rights and
even on zoning laws were insightful and illu-
minating. I recall once visiting my neighbor
and friend the Civil War historian Shelby Foote
and seeing Confederates in the Attic among
his books. He told me Horwitz had recently
visited and had dropped off a copy, and Foote
said he wished he’d read it before the visit.
Horwitz won his Pulitzer Prize as a reporter at
The Wall Street Journal for his stories on low-
wage workers at garbage recycling and poultry
processing plants and worked for The New
Yorker before writing Confederates in the
Attic. Known for his deep reporting and
participatory journalism, Horwitz also wrote
Blue Latitudes: Boldly Going Where Captain
Cook Has Gone Before (2002) in which he re-
traced the 18th century explorer’s voyages in
the Pacific; A Voyage Long and Strange: Re-
discovering the New World (2008), which
looked at what America was like before its Eu-
ropean discovery; Midnight Rising: John
Brown and the Raid that Sparked the Civil
War (2011) about the abolitionist’s 1859 attack
on the military arsenal at Harper’s Ferry; and
Spying on the South: An Odyssey Across the
American Divide that came out in May which
followed the future landscape architect Fred-
erick Law Olmstead’s reporting for The New
York Times from the South prior to the Civil
War. Horwitz’s reputation as a hands-on re-
porter and writer will be long remembered. I
wish to express my condolences to his wife,
the novelist Geraldine Brooks; to his sons Na-
thaniel and Bizu; and to his many fans and
friends.

RECOGNIZING WHITE COUNTY NA-
TIVE KELLIE JOLLY HARPER AS
LADY VOLS COACH
HON. JOHN W. ROSE
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize a true Ten-
nessee Volunteer, a daughter of Tennessee’s
Sixth Congressional District, and the new
Head Coach for the University of Tennessee
Lady Vols basketball team, Kellie Jolly Harper.
Coach Harper represents the best of Ten-
nessee. She is known nationwide for her grit
and her relentless pursuit of victory. No doubt
these traits were instilled in her first by her
coach and father, Kenneth Jolly, and mother,
Peggy Simpson Jolly, and honed into cham-
pionship ingredients by legendary coach Pat
Summitt.
Coach Harper was raised in Sparta, Ten-
nessee, a rural town in White County that has
been and continues to be home to some of
the hardest working people I have met. Her
work ethic as a standout player for White
County High School led to a starting position
with the most prestigious women’s basketball
program of all time, the Tennessee Lady Vol-
unteers. Before graduating from the University
of Tennessee in 1999, Coach Harper ran point
for three of Coach Summitt’s national title
teams, including a perfect 39–0 season in
1998. Even more incredibly, she achieved all
this success after suffering an injury to her
knee that would have been career-ending for
most.
Coach Harper is only the third Lady Vol
head coach in the NCAA era of women’s bas-
ketball. She returns to Rocky Top alongside
her husband and Assistant Coach, Jon Har-
per, and their children, Jackson and Kiley. I
have noticed her attention to her children
throughout her start as Tennessee’s Head
Coach and I pray that she and her family
enjoy a long and fruitful era in Knoxville.
I believe in the great promise of the Lady
Vols basketball program and know that with
this homegrown leader, the team is in great
hands. I wish my sincerest best to Coach
Kellie Jolly Harper and the Tennessee Lady
Vols. She has certainly made her hometown
and region proud. Welcome home, Coach,
and Go Big Orange.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ROBERT
W. DAVIS
HON. DAVID P. JOYCE
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Madam Speaker, today
I wish to honor the life and legacy of Mr. Rob-
ert W. Davis of Cortland, Ohio who passed
away surrounded by his loving family on
Thursday May 23, 2019. I rise to pay tribute
to his life’s work as an educator and mentor
who instilled a strong and deep understanding
of government and civic responsibility to the
generations of young people he taught
throughout his distinguished career at Maple-
wood High School in Northeast Ohio.
Bob was a 1967 graduate of Hubbard High
School in Hubbard Ohio, and in 1971 grad-
uated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Education
and later a Master’s Degree from Youngstown
State University.
Mr. Davis was a government and social
studies teacher at Maplewood High School for
35 years, retiring in 2006, where he also was
an assistant principal and taught driver’s edu-
cation. He also was the past president of
Lakeview Band Boosters. He enjoyed sharing
his love for music and social studies with
young people. But most importantly, he en-
couraged his students to be active and in-
formed citizens who participate and appreciate
our democratic process.
He was presently employed by the Trumbull
County Board of Elections, and an active
member of the Trumbull County Republican
Party. Bob was a member of Grace Lutheran
Church of Hubbard Ohio, a former Sunday
School Superintendent, and also started the
recycling center at the church. It is evident
that Bob lived a life of full of service to his
community, and applied his deep values and
principles to all aspects of his life.
He will be sadly missed by his family; his
wife the former Deborah A. Drummond whom
he married August 2, 1975; his son William
Paul Davis and his wife Alison of Dublin, Ohio,
and two grandchildren Jacqueline Clare and
Parker Joseph. Beside his parents, he was
preceded in death by his in-laws William D. &
Dorothy Drummond, and his sister-in-law Mar-
sha S. Drummond.
I extend my deepest sympathies to the
many family and friends whose lives were
blessed by Bob Davis.

1958 and moved to Bakersfield with his family
in 1965. David graduated from Foothill High
School and earned several accolades as part
of the Foothill High School basketball team, in-
cluding winning the California State Boys Bas-
ketball Championship in 1976 when he was a
senior. David stayed in our community for col-
lege, earning his Bachelor’s degree from Cali-
fornia State University, Bakersfield (CSUB)
and then obtaining his teaching credential in
1984. David returned to Foothill as a teacher
and coached the boys basketball team, guid-
ing the team to a championship in 1988. In

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E699
June 3, 2019
1992, David became the Dean of Students at
Foothill High School, a position where he con-
tinued to excel at serving the needs of his stu-
dents. He quickly rose through the ranks at
Kern High School District—the largest 9th
through 12th grade school district in the State
of California—and became Principal of Ba-
kersfield High School (BHS) in 1999.
As the BHS principal, David oversaw the
largest and oldest high school in the commu-
nity, which has a student body of almost 3,000
students. A principled and passionate educa-
tor, David made it his top priority to raise grad-
uation rates and ensure his students were pre-
pared for college. During his tenure at BHS,
he prioritized innovative academic programs,
making the school the first to start Project
Lead the Way, an academic program de-
signed to foster student interest in science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics
(STEM) fields through hands-on experience
and visiting local STEM-related businesses
around the community. I know that he is proud
of the multiple national championships that
BHS students won in Virtual Business, a com-
petition where students learn how to start, op-
erate, and market a new business. In addition,
David helped promote the Earl Warren Cup, a
civics competition for government students de-
signed to test their knowledge of American
history and politics.
An avid supporter of the BHS Drillers ath-
letic program, David can often be seen cheer-
ing on student athletes at basketball, baseball,
football, softball, soccer, and volleyball games,
golf, tennis, and wrestling matches, and track
& field, cross country, and swimming meets in
our community and at state championship
tournaments. In recognition of all his work at
BHS and for our community, CSUB inducted
David into its Alumni Hall of Fame in 2017.
And, as this year’s BHS seniors graduate,
David will have presided over 19 graduation
ceremonies, having the honor of personally
handing out diplomas to over 13,000 students.
On behalf of the 23rd Congressional District
of California and the thousands of students he
helped educate during his time at Foothill High
School and Bakersfield High School, I want to
thank David for his work and dedication in
molding the minds of our community’s next
generation of leaders, helping them to acquire
the skills and education during one of the
most important and formative times of their
lives. I also want to thank his wife Abby, his
daughter Becky, and his sons Tyler David and
Tyler Thomas, for sharing David with us in the
community, including the many late nights and
early mornings at work.
While it may be bittersweet for David to
leave the school that he so loves, I am sure
that he is looking forward to the next chapter
of life and spending more time with his wife
and family. I know that David will never leave
the BHS community because, as the saying
goes, ‘‘Once a Driller, always a Driller.’’
