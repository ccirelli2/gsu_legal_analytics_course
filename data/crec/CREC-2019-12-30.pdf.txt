PRO TEMPORE

PRAYER
Rabbi Arnold E. Resnicoff, Chaplain,
U.S. Navy, Retired, Washington, D.C.,
offered the following prayer:
Almighty God, we pray, reflect, and
meditate in different ways, but as a
year—a decade ends—and 2020 begins,
may we reaffirm, united, the hope of
Langston Hughes: ‘‘Let America be the
dream the dreamers dreamed.’’
Dreamers dreamed a nation founded
on equality, rights; a Constitution es-
tablished for a more perfect union for
liberty, for us, and our posterity. Our
votes, oaths, and acts, must reflect
those dreams.
With this decade’s last House prayer,
we give thanks for progress, look ahead
with hope, but with eyes wide open to
prejudice, hatred, and terror, that re-
main—fueling violence like the anti-
Semitic Hanukkah party attack Satur-
day; the Texas church attack Sunday—
praying, Almighty God, for strength to
dream the bravest dream our dreamers
dreamed, our people dreamed:
‘‘We shall overcome. We shall over-
come. We shall overcome, some day.
Deep in my heart, I do believe, we shall
overcome, some day.’’
And let us say, amen.
THE JOURNAL
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 7(a) of House Resolution
758, the Journal of the last day’s pro-

United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

RECOGNIZING THE TENTH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF
SIVANANTHAN LABORATORIES
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, December 30, 2019
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker,
today I rise to recognize Sivananthan Labora-
tories as it celebrates the tenth anniversary of
its founding, and its founder Dr. Sivalingam
Sivananthan for his many contributions to
science and applied technology.
Dr. Siva began his pioneering research on
molecular beam epitaxy at the University of Il-
linois at Chicago, where he was awarded a
Ph.D. in physics. His success in developing
technical applications for MBE, and his aware-
ness of the confluence of our state’s great re-
search universities with the scientific and engi-
neering talent located in the Chicago area,
forged a vision to create a technology incu-
bator in the mold of Bell Laboratories and
Xerox PARC. That vision was fulfilled by the
incorporation of Sivananthan Laboratories in
the fall of 2009.
Since its creation, Sivananthan Laboratories
has assisted emerging Chicago-area small
businesses to research new technologies and
convert that knowledge into innovative new
products and services. Sivananthan Labora-
tories also has provided foundational support
to InSPIRE, a not-for-profit whose mission is
to spark interest in the sciences among Chi-
cago-area students and nurture the growth of
a renewable energy ecosystem in Illinois.
In recent years, Dr. Siva and Sivananthan
Laboratories have turned their interest towards
innovation in artificial intelligence and machine
learning tools that support automatic data
processing of infrared imagery. Sivananthan
Laboratories has also increasingly explored
the use of infrared imagery in the agricultural
and medical sectors. Based on their long his-
tory of groundbreaking research and track
record of converting that research into com-
mercially viable technologies, we can look for-
ward to exciting new contributions to our sci-
entific understanding and the development of
new economic enterprises in Illinois and be-
yond.
Madam Speaker, I want to recognize the
great achievements of Dr. Siva and
Sivananthan Laboratories on the occasion of
the tenth anniversary of its founding, and ac-
knowledge their tireless efforts to advance re-
search in both hard science and applied tech-
nologies. As a former member of the
Sivananthan Laboratories team, I take special
pride in their achievements and wish them the
very best in all their present and future en-
deavors.
