PRAYER
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer:
Eternal Father, thank You for giving
us another day.
Though the House is entering a 2-
week recess, and many Members will be
returning to their districts to meet
with constituents, we know that work
will be getting done behind the overt
political scene.
While important and significant
issues are being addressed, may all
Members be imbued with the wisdom of
Solomon, the patience of Job, and pro-
ceed like Nathaniel, who was a man
without guile.
In all, let there be more light than
heat.
May all that is done be for Your
greater honor and glory.
Amen.

ined the Journal of the last day’s pro-
ceedings and announces to the House
her approval thereof.
Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour-
nal stands approved.
Ms. LEE of California. Madam
Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I
demand a vote on agreeing to the
Speaker’s approval of the Journal.
The SPEAKER. The question is on
the Speaker’s approval of the Journal.
The question was taken; and the

THANK YOU, RHONDA E. FOXX
(Ms. ADAMS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to thank and congratulate a tal-
ented young woman who has served as
my chief of staff for North Carolina’s
12th District for nearly 5 years, Rhonda
E. Foxx.
While her career path will be taking
on a new chapter beyond my office,
without question, Rhonda has been an
extraordinary and extremely valued
member of my leadership team.
An energetic, innovative, creative
thinker, Rhonda’s bold leadership and
talented initiatives guided Team
Adams to cultivate new possibilities in
higher education, diversity, and tech;
as well as signature cooperative-inclu-
sive partnerships between students and
businesses and corporate and tech sec-
tors, and historically Black colleges.
I, along with the entire Adams team,
our stakeholders and our many part-
ners are grateful for her leadership and
her service, and extend to Rhonda E.
Foxx our best wishes, and Godspeed.
Mr. Speaker, I say, well done,
Rhonda. I thank her.
f
CONGRATULATING SWEET CHEEKS
DIAPER BANK
(Mr. CHABOT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Sweet Cheeks
Diaper Bank for opening their newest
warehouse location in Lower Price
Hill.
Since they opened their doors in 2015,
these wonderful people have been a
lifeline for women and children in the
greater Cincinnati and northern Ken-
tucky area.
Over the span of 4 years, they have
donated over a million diapers that
have, without doubt, changed the qual-
ity of life for so many infants.
Last month alone, Sweet Cheeks dis-
tributed over 135,000 diapers through 43
community partners. They also deliv-
ered health aid kits to women and
schoolgirls who otherwise couldn’t af-
ford them.
This tremendous organization gives
back so much to our community and,
most importantly, gives so many
women and children in my district a
sense of dignity.
Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate
Sweet Cheeks Diaper Bank on their
newest warehouse location in Lower
Price Hill and sincerely thank them for
all they do for women and children in
the greater Cincinnati area.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8060 September 27, 2019
PFAS Task Force who have come to
the floor this week to call on our con-
gressional leadership, House Armed
Services Committee, and all the con-
ferees tasked with conferencing the fis-
cal year 2020 National Defense Author-
ization Act to include a strong PFAS
package.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman
SMITH for his leadership and tireless
work crafting this year’s NDAA. It is a
good bill, and it includes many top pri-
orities that will care for our service-
members and keep the United States
well defended, but we are in the midst
of a growing nationwide human health
and environmental crisis.
PFAS chemicals are harmful man-
made toxic substances wherever they
are found.
We know that there are up to 297
military installations that have con-
firmed PFAS contamination. This puts
our military families at risk and the
communities surrounding them at risk,
and it puts our national security at
risk if we do not include robust PFAS
provisions.
The American people are counting on
us to protect them, and we must in-
clude this provision. Our military is ar-
guing that this needs to be cleaned up.
Please keep PFAS in the bill.
f
NATIONAL CLEAN ENERGY WEEK
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize National
Clean Energy Week, September 23
through September 27.
Clean energy throughout our world is
critical in fighting climate change and
making our world greener and more ef-
ficient.
Currently, only a small portion of
our total energy consumption in the
U.S. comes from clean energy, and we
are going to need more innovation and
a booming economy to continue raising
the statistics for clean energy.
In this regard, Georgia has largely
been leading the way. Over the past 5
years, we have been one of the top ten
States in solar power, all without
State tax credits or mandates. 175,000
homes are powered by solar, an in-
crease of 13-fold over the last 5 years.
I am proud of the State of Georgia’s
work and hope the rest of the Nation
will follow our lead. However, while we
boost our clean energy, we cannot for-
get the importance of a consistent, re-
liable energy supply, as well as the im-
portance of energy independence to our
homeland security.
While I personally subscribe to an
all-of-the-above energy strategy, I en-
courage all of my colleagues during
this National Clean Energy Week to
honestly discuss these issues in a bi-
partisan fashion.
f
SICKLE CELL AWARENESS MONTH
(Ms. LEE of California asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to highlight September as
Sickle Cell Awareness Month and to
call for more research on the sickle
cell trait.
Today, I am introducing a resolution
calling for more sickle-cell trained re-
search and public education and aware-
ness on the disease.
Mr. Speaker, sickle cell disease is
America’s most commonly inherited
blood disorder and affects about 100,000
Americans. More than 3 million Ameri-
cans, including 1 in 12 African Ameri-
cans and 1 in 100 Latinos carry the
sickle cell trait, which can lead to
sickle cell disease.
For example, one is tested at birth to
determine whether they have the sick-
le cell trait, and that is it. Later in
life, there are certain tests, such as the
A1C test, which some are often given to
determine diabetes. Well, if you have
the sickle cell trait, you could get a
false positive from this test.
So it is very important that we fig-
ure out a way in terms of awareness,
education, and to dedicate our re-
sources to making sure that there are
strategies to provide the information
for adults so that they know that they
have the sickle cell trait. Right now,
millions of people have it and they
don’t know it.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this bipartisan resolution.
f
RECOGNIZING MARTY BRENNAMAN
(Mr. WENSTRUP asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the career and re-
tirement of the Cincinnati Reds leg-
endary Hall of Fame broadcaster,
Marty Brennaman.
Yesterday, Marty signed off for the
last game of his famed career. He has
been part of our lives and the voice of
our beloved Reds for 46 years.
Marty was with us for his very first
broadcast when Hank Aaron tied Babe
Ruth for the most home runs hit ever.
He was with us when Pete Rose broke
Ty Cobb’s longstanding record for most
career hits.
He was with us through three World
Series titles.
Marty Brennaman is an institution
in Cincinnati. He feels like family.
Marty helped make both Riverfront
Stadium and the Great American Ball
Park feel like a second home to so
many.
I know we will all miss hearing his
play-by-play, his insights, and his sto-
ries.
Although I never saw Marty swing a
bat, I will be glad to replay his greatest
hits for the rest of my life.
I know I join Reds fans across Cin-
cinnati and the country in a collective
good-bye to one of our greatest, and
this one belongs to Marty.
TREASON
(Mr. DEFAZIO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, well, I
saw an extraordinary clip of President
Trump at a fundraising event where he
is accusing the intelligence agents who
rightly reported his conduct of com-
mitting treason.
Let’s see. Russia has invaded
Ukraine, Ukraine is dependent upon
the United States for military assist-
ance to defend itself, Trump is with-
holding the aid, at the same time ask-
ing them for dirt on his political oppo-
nent.
He is jeopardizing the national secu-
rity interests of the United States.
If anybody is committing treason,
and I believe that is an impeachable of-
fense, it is the President of the United
States, Donald Trump.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
CUELLAR). Members are reminded to re-
frain from engaging in personalities to-
ward the President.
f
NATIONAL HISPANIC HERITAGE
MONTH
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize National Hispanic
Heritage Month and the contributions
of Hispanic Americans in my congres-
sional district in central Washington
State.
Growing up in Sunnyside, Wash-
ington, I have witnessed firsthand how
Hispanic Americans contribute to our
communities through entrepreneur-
ship, military service, and cultural di-
versity. They are our friends, our fam-
ily, our neighbors, and our coworkers.
They are small businessowners, doc-
tors, police officers, and soldiers.
While we may take 1 month out of
the year to recognize the historical and
cultural contributions of our Hispanic
American friends, we should do more to
support and highlight our appreciation.
That is why I am an original cosponsor
of the National Museum of the Amer-
ican Latino Act, to finally create a
Smithsonian museum to recognize and
celebrate Hispanic American and
Latino history in our country.
As Americans, we share a common
heritage as a Nation of immigrants,
and the people of central Washington
cherish our diverse culture and history.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in celebrating National His-
panic Heritage Month.

September 27, 2019
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, as we
well know, the rules of the House ad-
monish speakers from including per-
sonalities. I would suggest that my col-
league opposite crossed that line. I will
remove my point of order if the Speak-
er cautions my colleague opposite that
such violation will not be tolerated in

f
RECOGNIZING INTERNATIONAL
AUTOMAKERS IN U.S.
(Mr. FLEISCHMANN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to celebrate the positive im-
pact international automakers’ invest-
ments have made in the United States
and, specifically, in my home State of
Tennessee.
Today, international automakers op-
erate 30 manufacturing facilities across
12 States and build more than 60 dif-
ferent vehicle models in America.
Volkswagen is a huge part of that pres-
ence in the Third District of Tennessee.
Tennessee is also home to the Infiniti
Decherd Powertrain Plant; the Nissan
Decherd Powertrain Plant; the Nissan
Smyrna Vehicle Assembly Plant; the
Nissan Smyrna Battery Plant; Toyota-
Bodine Aluminum, Inc.; and the head-
quarters of both INFINITI Americas
and Nissan North America.
In January, Volkswagen announced
an additional investment of $800 mil-
lion for its Chattanooga facility to
build two electric vehicles, with the
groundbreaking taking place in No-
vember.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to
join me in recognizing the important
role of international automakers in the
United States.

TERMINATION OF NATIONAL
EMERGENCY DECLARED BY THE
PRESIDENT ON FEBRUARY 15,
2019
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, pursuant
to House Resolution 591, I call up the
joint resolution (S.J. Res. 54) relating
to a national emergency declared by
the President on February 15, 2019, and
ask for its immediate consideration.
The Clerk read the title of the joint
resolution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 591, the joint
resolution is considered read.
The text of the joint resolution is as
follows:
S.J. RES. 54
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled, That, pursuant to section
202 of the National Emergencies Act (50
U.S.C. 1622), the national emergency declared
by the finding of the President on February
15, 2019, in Proclamation 9844 (84 Fed. Reg.
4949) is hereby terminated.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
joint resolution shall be debatable for 1
hour equally divided and controlled by
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure.
The gentleman from Oregon (Mr.
DEFAZIO) and the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. MEADOWS) each
will control 30 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Oregon.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on S.J. Res.
54.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon?
There was no objection.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, the President has de-
clared a national emergency so that he
can divert funds from the Pentagon
and other agencies to deal with the na-
tional emergency on the border. The
largest diversion of funds is going into
a wall.
The President says the emergency is
mostly about the smuggling of drugs.
Interesting.
As we know from testimony when
Carlos Guzman was tried and convicted
in New York, a big drug lord from Mex-
ico, his hench-people and others testi-
fied that the cartels don’t use people
with backpacks through remote areas
of the desert. That is too inefficient for
a multibillion-dollar business.
What they do is send trucks, which
they have modified, semis, through our
border control points, where we only
inspect 6 percent of the trucks, so they
lose one every once in a while. So
what? With tens of millions of dollars,
it doesn’t matter to them. It is just the
cost of doing business, kind of like
taxes.
What is the President doing about
the border control points? Nothing. We
are not buying the new technology we
need and reconfiguring them so that we
can inspect every truck that comes
across the border.
They have another way of getting the
drugs in, which they are using more
and more and more. That is that they
use semi-submersibles and other boats
and ships to smuggle the drugs around,
on the coasts of the United States.
The Coast Guard is our prime line of
defense against this. The retired last
Commandant of the Coast Guard said
that we have actionable intelligence on
80 percent of the drug shipments com-
ing into the United States, but the
Coast Guard only has resources to
intercept 20 percent.
Just last week, the Coast Guard
intercepted a semi-submersible that
had 12,000 pounds of cocaine on it. That
would be a heck of a lot of people with
backpacks coming across the border, as
the President alleges—no, that is not
the way they do it—worth over $165
million.
What is the President doing? He is di-
verting money from the Coast Guard to
the physical, land-based border and
saying that somehow this is going to
help us stop the drug shipments.
Here is the Coast Guard with a prior
drug shipment that they intercepted.
Now, they just intercepted another.
We have all seen the videos of them
jumping onto these semi-submersibles
out in the middle of the Pacific, with 6-
to 8-foot swells, jumping on there and
stopping and arresting these people.
What is the President doing? He is
cutting the Coast Guard’s capability of
doing this.
Back to the border. Again, there are
a few things we could be doing.
Oh, look, there is something just like
what the President wants, a big, tall
fence with slats. People seem to be
climbing over it.
Here is the border control point. Six
percent of these vehicles will be in-
spected.
Here is a tunnel under it.
There is a drone over it.
Some of these people are really inge-
nious. They even are imitating the
Middle Ages, using catapults to throw
drugs over where there is an existing
wall.
Here we are, cutting $6 billion from
the Pentagon for critical needs of the
Pentagon for housing where troops are
living in mold-infested barracks, for
training facilities for the National
Guard, for firefighting facilities on our
military bases, and from daycare cen-
ters for our troops’ kids. And we don’t
pay these troops a heck of a lot of
money; they can’t afford to send their
kids off base to daycare.
The President says all that stuff is
going to be cut because we have to
build his stupid wall, which isn’t even
targeting the way drugs are really
brought into the United States of
America. This is just an abysmally stu-
pid waste of money, but he is deliv-
ering on a campaign promise.
Oh, wait a minute. Mexico is going to
pay. Who is going to pay? Mexico. Who
is going to pay? Mexico.
Then he had a phone call with the
President of Mexico saying: I know you
are not going to pay it—we have this
transcript, too—but you can’t say pub-
licly you are not going to pay for it.
We are going to pay for it.
The taxpayers of the United States
are going to pay for his stupid, useless
wall, cutting essential things from the
Coast Guard, which does real, dan-
gerous work every day intercepting
drugs; cutting funds from the military,
which needs these facilities for their
troops, troop morale, and the safety
and security of our troops. All for a
stupid wall.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, this has nothing to do
with the Coast Guard. This has every-
thing to do with politics.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8062 September 27, 2019
Mr. Speaker, when they get up and
have this faux outrage over this, it is
about this President and their opposi-
tion to a secure border.
Now, I would point out to the gen-
tleman opposite, when President
Barack Obama requested $3.7 billion in
emergency funding, there was not a
peep from the other side of the aisle,
and all of a sudden, there is this out-
rage. The gentleman knows all too
well, Mr. Speaker, that this is not even
going to cut the funding.
I see over there that we have the
chairwoman of the Appropriations
Committee. She knows that this Presi-
dent, under his leadership, is funding
the military and our Coast Guard at
levels that we have never seen.
For my friend opposite to suggest
that this is all about the Coast Guard,
this is all about politics, making sure
that there is an open border.
When he had the chance, Mr. Speak-
er, to vote to make sure that we limit
any of these funds going to this, what
did he do? He looked the other way. He
voted for a CR just the other day. He
voted to allow this money to continue
to flow.
This is a show vote, Mr. Speaker.
This has nothing to do with really leg-
islating.
If they want to legislate, let’s figure
out how we work on those separations
at the border. Let’s look at the Flores
decision. Let’s make sure that we are
constructive.
I have had, Mr. Speaker, conversa-
tions with some on the other side of
the aisle. I am willing. But what we are
seeing today is nothing more than po-
litical theater.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
such time as she may consume to the
gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.
LOWEY), the chair of the Appropria-
tions Committee.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, the Presi-
dent’s fake national emergency is an
end run around this Congress’ power of
the purse and an offense to the Con-
stitution.
As the Committee on Appropriations
chair, I am outraged that this Presi-
dent has canceled $3.6 billion in mili-
tary construction projects to pay for a
wasteful wall.
I want to repeat: $3.6 billion in mili-
tary construction projects to pay for a
wasteful wall.
The President chose his wall over our
national security and the needs of our
servicemembers and their families.
Congressional Democrats have re-
peatedly made clear, including in our
appropriations bills, that we will not
give this President a blank check by
backfilling these projects.
Terminating the President’s fake na-
tional emergency declaration is the
only way to restore the 127 projects
whose funding the President stole. I
urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, facts
are a stubborn thing. I would like to
point out to my good friend from New
York that, indeed, we are backfilling
that. These projects will get funded.
She knows that; I know that; and soon,
the American people will know that.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from California (Mr.
LAMALFA).
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank
my colleague, Mr. MEADOWS, for the
opportunity here today.
Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, my
Democratic colleagues passed a meas-
ure that would install an ombudsman
within DHS to monitor the practices of
our Border Patrol and detainment offi-
cers. Thankfully, the Senate imme-
diately tossed that idea aside.
I have some good news for my col-
leagues across the aisle, however, be-
cause I can tell you that any inspec-
tion of our border facilities would find
an agency, though underfunded, stand-
ing strong, despite a record-setting del-
uge of people coming at our southern
border.
b 0930
Looks like today is Groundhog Day
because we are voting on yet another
resolution to stop being able to legally
call what is happening on our southern
border an emergency.
My colleagues justify this by calling
the President’s actions unprecedented.
Unprecedented is what you call it when
our immigration system is on pace to
be overwhelmed by a million immi-
grants pleading asylum. Maybe Demo-
crats call this policy.
Unprecedented is what you call it
when Congress refuses to fund our na-
tional security agencies and starts
threatening to abolish an agency and
fire our enforcement officers for doing
their job.
The situation is unprecedented, but
it is not because the President’s ac-
tions are unprecedented. It is the ac-
tions from my Democrat colleagues.
Rather than further consider this
resolution, I hope the majority leader
and Speaker immediately allow us to
recognize the crisis—as some Demo-
crats have, inadvertently—that we are
facing on the border.
Let’s address the root causes of the
emergency. Fund the Border Patrol’s $3
billion backlog, and install physical
barriers and security measures nec-
essary to ensure the whole length of
our southern border is secure.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. BROWN), a member of the
committee of jurisdiction.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise to once again oppose the
President’s outrageous decision to de-
clare a national emergency.
President Trump repeatedly prom-
ised that Mexico would pay for his bor-
der wall, but now he is diverting
money, $3.6 billion, away from our
servicemembers, military families, and
their children.
Two projects were canceled in my
district at Joint Base Andrews. Joint
Base Andrews is home to Air Force
One. It is the cornerstone of military
security in our Nation’s Capital.
President Trump canceled a much-
needed new childcare facility for fami-
lies at Joint Base Andrews. We have
been working on this for over a decade.
The current childcare center, which I
visited 2 weeks ago, 2 years ago, was
constructed during World War II. It is
too small to serve the children on base.
There is a 200-child waiting list.
It suffers from sewage backup. That
is right, classes are canceled when the
sewer backs up. The kitchen closes
when the sewer backs up, and that hap-
pens every other month.
It has got mold and rodent infesta-
tion, a leaking roof that collapsed 5
years ago, and a failing heating and
air-conditioning system.
Servicemembers will be forced to use
more expensive and lower quality off-
base programs. The Department of De-
fense studied it; they estimated it; and
it will cost military families $10,000 a
year, each, money that is coming out
of their pocket. Why? To build a wall.
The families at Andrews have been
waiting for years for a modern, safe
building, and now we are telling them
to wait. We are telling kids to go with-
out so President Trump can build his
wall before 2020.
Servicemembers that defend our Na-
tion should never have to worry about
the safety and well-being of their chil-
dren while they are serving our Nation.
This isn’t the only project being can-
celed at Andrews. The President can-
celed a hazardous material cargo pad
necessary to load ordnance and muni-
tions onto planes. The Pentagon said
that, without this project, Andrews
will have ‘‘enduring systemic weak-
nesses in its ability to support required
military activities.’’
Think September 11, 9/11. We relied
on fighter jets from Andrews, and now
we are risking their mission with this
cut.
The President is also canceling doz-
ens of essential projects that would
provide relief in Puerto Rico and in Eu-
rope against Russian aggression. It
hurts morale among the men and
women who sacrifice more and more
every year.
Voting to end this national emer-
gency is the only way to restore fund-
ing that the President has taken from
our troops and their families. The ad-
ministration should not build this inef-
fective, xenophobic, vanity project on
the backs of the military.
When we face critical challenges at
home and abroad, this kind of action
hurts our ability to respond to real-
world emergencies.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I would remind the gen-
tleman opposite that there is not a sin-
gle delay in the plan of building those
facilities at Andrews, and the gen-
tleman knows it. What happens is the
hyperbole from the other side doesn’t
match the facts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8063
September 27, 2019
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Florida (Mr. SPANO).
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, for the
third time, we will vote to terminate
President Trump’s national emergency
declaration related to the crisis on our
southern border.
When are we going to get serious
about solving the issue?
For the first half of the year, Demo-
crats wouldn’t even acknowledge that
there was a crisis. They ignored the re-
ports from Border Patrol showing
record levels of illegal crossings month
after month.
Mr. Speaker, I thought we had
progress in June, at least in terms of
Democrats acknowledging that we
have a crisis. You see, 305 Members of
the House and 84 Members of the Sen-
ate voted to provide emergency funding
in response to the humanitarian crisis.
Unfortunately, we are back to the
same partisan votes we started the
year with.
Today is the last day the House will
meet in session in fiscal year 2019. I
wish I could tell my constituents, yes,
we are going to terminate the emer-
gency declaration because the fiscal
year 2020 appropriations bill provides
the money needed to secure the border,
but that could not be further from the
truth.
Not a single full-year appropriations
bill has been signed into law. In fact,
the House hasn’t even voted on next
year’s Homeland Security appropria-
tions bill.
This brings me back to my question
of when. When are Democrats going to
get serious about securing our border?
It is certainly not in the appropria-
tions bills they have drafted.
Section 227 of their Homeland Secu-
rity bill reads: ‘‘No Federal funds may
be used for the construction of physical
barriers along the southern land border
of the United States during the fiscal
year 2020.’’
Their Defense appropriations bill
went even further. That bill prohibits
any funds from being used ‘‘to con-
struct a wall, fence, border barriers, or
border security infrastructure along
the southern land border of the United
States.’’
It is unbelievable. Not only is there
no funding for physical barriers, they
specifically prohibit it.
My constituents did not elect me to
stand by silently as we transition to
open borders in this country, and I will
not. I call on my colleagues across the
aisle: Let’s put this partisan vote be-
hind us; let’s get serious; and let’s
work together to secure our border. It
is what the American people want and
expect us to do.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, just in quick response
to the gentleman, as I pointed out ear-
lier, first off, the immigrants attempt-
ing to come to the United States seek-
ing asylum or otherwise are walking up
to border control points. They are not
sneaking across the desert. Building a
wall will do nothing.
As I pointed out earlier, drugs are
not being smuggled in backpacks
through the desert. We know they are
coming by sea, and we know they are
coming through our border control
points; and we know we don’t have the
technology nor the personnel necessary
to stop them.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ).
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.
Speaker, we are standing here today
because the President has decided that
a campaign promise is more important
than the safety and security of our Na-
tion.
Earlier this month, the President
stole funds from our brave servicemem-
bers to pay for a costly monument to
waste. Instead of owning up to the
falsehood that Mexico would pay for
his border wall, Trump has chosen to
degrade our national security.
The continuation of this fake emer-
gency declaration poses a direct threat
to both our military families and
America’s national security. It steals
from soldiers who must now keep send-
ing children to overcrowded schools. It
forces servicemembers to work on
bases where hazardous materials sit in
unsafe facilities.
These Trump cuts sacrifice emer-
gency and fire rescue facilities, flight
simulation facilities, roads, clinics,
and dining halls, just to name a few.
This action will make training readi-
ness and life harder for America’s fami-
lies and hurts our national security.
But don’t take my word for it; take
the word of a recent Air Force report
that detailed the risk to our troops and
national security at home and abroad
with the diversion of these previously
appropriated funds.
‘‘At Eielson Air Force Base in Alas-
ka, a boiler failure at a facility that
provides all electrical power and steam
heat for the base is ‘imminent,’’’ the
report says. ‘‘With temperatures as low
as 65 degrees below zero, a failure
would be devastating to facilities, and
the missions housed by them within
hours. The base would be forced to
evacuate within hours and, once closed,
would freeze and require millions of
dollars of repair to return to usable
conditions.’’
It does not sound like the border wall
for a fake emergency is more impor-
tant than making sure we don’t close
an entire base in Alaska.
I will remind Members that this wall
was rejected by a bipartisan majority,
and the fake national emergency was
rejected by bipartisan majorities, twice
now, in the Republican Senate.
This is using the playbook of an au-
thoritarian, jeopardizing our military
readiness to steal a wall after it could
not be lawfully secured. This is a dan-
gerous precedent. I hope all of my Re-
publican colleagues join me in termi-
nating this ‘‘emergency’’ declaration.
We all should agree that bypassing
Congress and the Constitution and
starving the military of funding is not
patriotism. It is everything that true
patriots fight against.
I urge my colleagues to vote for this
resolution and send a message to our
troops that their safety and our Na-
tion’s military readiness matter more
than fulfilling a deceptive campaign
promise.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire as to the remaining time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 171⁄2 minutes
remaining. The gentleman from North
Carolina has 241⁄2 minutes remaining.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I need to clarify, once
again, another fact. The gentleman op-
posite seems to think that all of the
drugs and all of the bad things come in
at the ports of entry, when the facts
are, since 2014, U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Protection has actually seized
more drugs between the ports of entry
than at the ports of entry.
So I would like to, and if the gen-
tleman wants to review the facts with
me, I will be glad to do it. We actually
collected 6.4 million pounds of drugs
between the ports of entry versus 3.1
million at the ports of entry.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs.
MILLER).
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to speak in opposition to the res-
olution on the floor.
Yesterday, we had one of the most
important hearings in this Congress,
where we learned about innovations in
energy efficiency and carbon capture.
These real solutions will allow us to
provide affordable, clean, and reliable
energy to continue to give America and
the world the security and prosperity
that we enjoy.
It took us 9 months to have that
hearing. Unfortunately, not every
hearing we have provides solutions.
For the past 9 months, instead of
prioritizing our Nation’s infrastruc-
ture, solving the opioid epidemic, or
ending the crisis—yes, crisis—on our
southern border, my colleagues across
the aisle have spent countless hours ex-
ploiting important committee meet-
ings, searching for something, any-
thing, that would impugn our duly-
elected President.
We need to stop wasting time on
these political games. The President
has already vetoed this ridiculous reso-
lution, and he has promised to veto it
again.
We must secure our southern border.
The President has taken action, while
this House has tried to undermine his
efforts at every step.
We must put aside our political dif-
ferences to save the thousands of lives
we lose every year to fentanyl and the
opioid epidemic and to save the lives of
the young boys and girls who are being
trafficked across the border against
their will.
I was sent to Congress to create jobs,
fix our infrastructure, and innovate the
energy industry, not to bicker over

partisan squabbles. I strongly oppose
this legislation, and I urge my col-
leagues to do the same.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, just in quick response
to my colleague from North Carolina, a
member of the committee of jurisdic-
tion, the Coast Guard has interdicted
more drugs than all of the other Fed-
eral agencies combined, yet they say
they are only acting on 20 percent of
them. So that is a pretty big hole.
But the second thing is, she is right.
We are not interdicting very many
drugs at the points of entry because we
only inspect 6 percent of the semis
with high technology. And Guzman’s
buddies said: That is how we bring it
in. We put fake floors in the semis, and
we are bringing tons of drugs across.
He is right. We are not intercepting
them because we don’t have the per-
sonnel and we don’t have the tech-
nology.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CAS-
TRO).
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
in February, I authored a resolution to
reject the President’s emergency dec-
laration at the border. Both Chambers
of Congress, a Democratic House and a
Republican Senate, rejected that sham
declaration by passing the resolution.
Today, we consider a similar resolution
to terminate the President’s emer-
gency declaration.
A border wall does nothing to make
us safer or address the real humani-
tarian crisis at our border. This time
around, the President is raiding actual
national security priorities to build his
wall. He is stealing millions of dollars
reserved for important projects that
range from training sites for our serv-
icemembers to the schools for their
children, to our military readiness
projects.
b 0945
It is shameful that our servicemen
and -women are collateral damage in
his quest to build this racist wall. It is
a disgrace that money is being stolen
from over two dozen States and terri-
tories, ensuring that American tax-
payers—not Mexico, as the President
repeatedly promised—are actually pay-
ing for the wall.
For example, in my district alone, we
are losing out on $18.5 million in mili-
tary construction funds. In the State of
Texas, that number is $38.5 million.
The total impact for the entire country
is over $1 billion.
This should be shameful to all of my
colleagues that this administration
would leave our military families out
to dry. I ask all of my colleagues to
vote their conscience and to vote their
district.
I would also add that the heavy bur-
den of this wall will be felt by the peo-
ple in the Rio Grande Valley and in
south Texas. Miles and miles of private
property, Texans’ land, will be taken to
build Donald Trump’s wall.
There have been stories about how
people’s property will be split; some of
it in front of the wall, some of it be-
hind the wall. Some people, there will
be the wall in front of them, and they
will have to drive and use a clicker to
open the wall to come into what would
be considered the United States. Those
are American citizens who are literally
going to be behind the wall in Texas
because of Donald Trump.
This is a shame. This was a simple
campaign promise. This doesn’t do any-
thing to keep us safer. I hope, as we did
last time, that this House of Rep-
resentatives, Republicans and Demo-
crats, will vote overwhelmingly to ter-
minate the President’s emergency dec-
laration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, the gentleman opposite
was just talking about the fact that
one particular person might have to
use a clicker. What about the millions
of Americans who go down to our bor-
der right now and they can’t even go on
U.S. territory because the cartel con-
trols it.
The gentleman knows all too well
that the border on our southern border
is controlled in areas by a cartel. But
far be it from me to be the expert. We
have the expert here on that particular
subject.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ROG-
ERS), my good friend, the ranking
member of the Homeland Security
Committee.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
In the last year, nearly 1 million ille-
gal immigrants attempted to cross our
southwest border. Let me put that into
perspective for you.
One million is more than the popu-
lation of Delaware, or South Dakota or
North Dakota or Alaska or Vermont or
Wyoming. One million is approxi-
mately the population of Austin,
Texas; San Jose, California; or Jack-
sonville, Florida.
For months, migrant families and
children arrived at the border in droves
thanks to sophisticated smuggling op-
erations. Coyotes told vulnerable popu-
lations that a child was their ticket
into the United States—whether or not
it was their child. The massive groups
of migrants overwhelmed our border
patrol facilities, leading to over-
crowding and unacceptable conditions
for migrants and law enforcement
alike.
At the high-water mark of this crisis,
more than 50 percent of the border pa-
trol agents were pulled off the front
lines to process, transport, and care for
the record numbers of migrant children
and families. The men and women of
CBP have worked hard to manage this
crisis while Democrats in this House
were busy talking about a fake emer-
gency at our border.
The administration has taken ex-
traordinary steps like the migrant pro-
tection protocols, DNA testing to catch
child smugglers, and interpreted new
rules to reduce abuse of our asylum
laws.
While the President is doing every-
thing in his power to manage the cri-
sis, House Democrats have done noth-
ing. They steadfastly refuse to do any-
thing to fix our broken immigration
system, to protect vulnerable families
and children from human smugglers, to
reduce the asylum backlog, or expand
migrant processing and long-term
housing. Now they want to take away
the President’s authority to respond to
this crisis and prevent another one
from happening. It is disgraceful.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on
this resolution.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. BROWNLEY).
Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr.
Speaker, I rise in support of S.J. Res.
54. The President’s declaring a national
emergency in order to deliver on a
failed campaign promise is a gross mis-
use of power and sets a dangerous
precedent.
Not only is the President’s fake na-
tional emergency unconstitutional, but
he is choosing to undermine actual
military readiness by diverting con-
struction funding to the border wall.
For instance, President Trump is tar-
geting critical military projects, in-
cluding a California Air National
Guard flight simulator, which is in-
tended to train C–130J pilots who put
their lives on the line every day fight-
ing wildfires, among many other mis-
sions.
Based in Ventura County in my dis-
trict with over 1,200 highly trained and
talented National Guard personnel, the
146th Airlift Wing has been called up to
respond to many of our Nation’s true—
true—true—national emergencies, in-
cluding the Mendocino Complex fire
and the Thomas fire, the largest fires
ever recorded in California’s history.
The 146th Airlift Wing also responded
to the Camp fire, one of the deadliest
and most destructive wildfires in U.S.
history.
Across the country, the 146th Airlift
Wing has been a critical component of
Federal disaster response and humani-
tarian relief efforts, including in Puer-
to Rico in response to Hurricane Maria,
in Florida in response to Hurricane
Irma, and in Texas in response to Hur-
ricane Harvey. Stealing the funds for
this critical flight simulator will harm
readiness and delay necessary training
for our Air National Guard members
who risk their lives to save the lives of
others.
The fact that President Trump is
willing to undermine military readi-
ness, California’s firefighting capabili-
ties, and our Nation’s emergency re-
sponse efforts is unconscionable. We
are talking about potential lives lost.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
vote for S.J. Res. 54 and end this made-

up crisis and fake emergency. What I
am talking about here today is a real
emergency.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I would
like to again inquire as to the time re-
maining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 131⁄2 minutes
remaining.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume. I
would like to say that I have a solution
for all of this.
The gentlewoman was just talking
about an emergency. The chairman of
the Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee is talking about the Coast
Guard. I will join both of them in mak-
ing sure that we fund it, if they will
join me in appropriating $3.7 billion to
secure our southern border. If it is an
emergency, then let’s get together and
work in a bipartisan fashion.
But do you know what?
This is not about an emergency. This
is about talking points, this is about
politics, and it is about wanting an
open border; and they know it.
But I am willing to work with them.
I see the gentleman from California. I
am willing to work with him on the
Coast Guard. It is his passion. Let’s
fund the Coast Guard, and let’s fund
the border. We will get together.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from California (Mr.
MCCLINTOCK).
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, for
43 years the President of the United
States has had the statutory authority
granted by this Congress to declare a
national emergency and to reprogram
unobligated military construction
funds to meet that emergency. Fifty-
eight times previous Presidents have
invoked this authority to address such
matters as civil unrest in Sierra Leone
and Burma.
Only when this President invokes his
authority for the 59th time to address
the most serious national security cri-
sis in our lifetime—the collapse of our
southern border—only then do we hear
protests from the left and its disciples
in Congress.
Under our Constitution, the Congress
appropriates money but cannot spend
it, and the President spends money but
cannot appropriate it. He spends it ac-
cording to laws given to him by this
Congress. In this case, Congress appro-
priated funds and delegated to the
President precisely the authority to
spend those funds that he is now exer-
cising. Whether Congress should have
delegated this authority is a separate
question that no one has raised in 43
years. But while that authority exists,
the President has both a right and a
duty to use it to defend our country.
We also hear protests that the Presi-
dent’s act will divert money from other
construction projects. I ask them:
What is more important to our Na-
tion’s defense than the defense of our
own borders? A childcare center in
Maryland? Really?
Our Nation is going to have to have a
serious discussion over whether we
wish to continue as a sovereign nation
with the uniquely American principles
and customs that have made us, in Lin-
coln’s words, the last best hope of man-
kind on this Earth, or whether we will
allow the Democrats to render our bor-
ders meaningless and reduce our once
great nation into nothing more than a
vast international territory between
Canada and Mexico.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I just
would comment, the gentleman just
said it is insignificant—or whatever—
because he just demeaned a childcare
center for the troops at Andrews, and
he heard about the conditions that
those children are living under: sewage,
mold, and collapsed roof, but he doesn’t
think that is necessary for the troops
or the troops’ kids.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from California (Ms.
PELOSI).
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding, and I thank
the chairman for making that very im-
portant point about the quality of life
of the families of our men and women
in uniform, which appears to have been
demeaned by our colleagues.
Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress
take a sacred oath to support and de-
fend the Constitution and to protect
the American people. Today the House
honors that oath with this resolution
to defend our national security and our
Constitution’s system of checks and
balances: the guardrails created by our
Founders to safeguard our Republic.
The President’s decision to cancel
$3.6 billion for military construction to
pay for his wasteful wall makes Amer-
ica less safe. The administration is
stealing funds from 127 initiatives in 21
countries, 23 States, and three terri-
tories, stooping so low as to steal from
a middle school at Fort Campbell in
Kentucky.
A recent U.S. Air Force report shows
that canceling these projects hurts our
national security worldwide, including
in Europe where the President is can-
celing construction for the European
defense initiative which deters Russian
aggression. The President is canceling
a project which deters Russian aggres-
sion. That makes the Russians very
happy.
In the Middle East he is canceling
maintenance at a key base to protect
our troops from—in the words of this
Air Force report—hostile penetration
in the midst of contingency operations
and an increased terrorist threat.
In the Pacific he is canceling con-
struction on storage facilities in Guam
for more than $1 billion in munitions,
the largest stockpile in the region; and
in North America he is canceling re-
pairs which are based in Alaska which
are needed to prevent an explosion that
would cause a full evacuation and re-
quire millions of dollars of repair.
b 1000
That decision also disrespects mili-
tary families, as our distinguished
chair, Mr. DEFAZIO, mentioned.
A coalition of leading education,
labor, and veterans organizations
wrote to the President to express their
‘‘profound concern,’’ saying, ‘‘Our
troops and their families deserve much
better for their sacrifices.’’
The President had said Mexico will
pay for his wall, not military families.
The administration’s decision also
dishonors the Constitution by negating
its most fundamental principle, the
separation of powers, in an assault on
our power of the purse. It does great vi-
olence to our Constitution and our de-
mocracy and strikes at the heart of our
Founder’s conception of America,
which demands a separation of powers.
Indeed, many White House decisions
that have recently come to light show
this same disdain and disregard for the
Constitution.
Today, we join the Senate—congratu-
lations to the Senate—in a bipartisan
way to restore our system of checks
and balances and reassert Congress’
constitutional responsibilities.
This issue transcends partisan poli-
tics. All Members take the oath to pro-
tect and defend. We continue to urge
House Republicans to join us to uphold
the Constitution and defend and sup-
port our national security.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. ADERHOLT).
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from North Caro-
lina (Mr. MEADOWS), my friend and col-
league, for yielding.
I also rise today to ask my colleagues
to oppose the joint resolution, which,
obviously, as has been said will termi-
nate the President’s proclamation, as
he has declared a national emergency
on the southern border.
As I have previously stated during
other debates on this issue, it is clear
that there is a national emergency
that exists. The American people un-
derstand that unchecked and unregu-
lated immigration, which is in viola-
tion of our Nation’s laws, has created a
border security and humanitarian cri-
sis, which allows the flow of drugs,
human trafficking, and gang members
into this country, as well as causing
desperate situations that are faced by
women and children who make this
dangerous journey.
Furthermore, I think it is important
for this debate that we remember and
make clear that it is clearly within the
authority provided by Congress for the
President to do this.
As an appropriator, I understand the
importance of Congress’ responsibility
for military construction funding, and
I appreciate the work my colleagues
have done on the Subcommittee on
Military Construction, Veterans Af-
fairs, and Related Agencies. I had the
privilege to be a vice chair of that sub-
committee several years ago. But I also
recognize that Congress has to provide
the executive branch with reprogram-
ming authority for military construc-
tion under title 10, U.S. Code, section
2808.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8066 September 27, 2019
This is not the first time this author-
ity has been invoked. President George
Bush invoked it, and President Obama
invoked it. I think it was a total of 18
projects between those two Presidents,
between 2001 and 2014.
I think most Americans agree with
President Trump that there is an emer-
gency at the southern border. It has
gotten worse in recent years.
I ask my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on
this resolution and acknowledge the se-
riousness of the border security and
the humanitarian crises on the border.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
oppose this joint resolution.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, may I
inquire as to how much time each side
has remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from North Carolina has 141⁄2
minutes remaining. The gentleman
from Oregon has 11 minutes remaining.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GARAMENDI).
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.
DEFAZIO).
Mr. Speaker, to my good friends on
the Republican side of the aisle, this is
really about the Constitution.
Madison, in the Federalist Papers,
wrote that the appropriations power—
that is, the power of the purse—is the
ultimate power that Congress has to
rein in excesses by the President or
even by the court. That is where we are
today.
It is not that there is an emergency.
We can all agree there is a problem.
Call it an emergency at the border.
There are many others—fires, floods,
Houston, you name it. There are plenty
of emergencies.
It is not that the President shouldn’t
have the authority and power to de-
clare an emergency and then deal with
it. That is not the issue here. The issue
here is that this particular emergency
declaration by the President was spe-
cifically used to circumscribe and
usurp the authority of Congress in our
power of the purse.
Keep in mind, government was shut
down for 35 days because the President
wanted money for his wall. We debated
it. At the end of that, we appropriated
$1.3 billion or so for border security, in-
cluding some fences and walls.
The President signed that bill and
then immediately turned around and
declared an emergency shortly there-
after, used that emergency power to rip
off $3.6 billion from necessary military
construction projects around the
world, of which $770 million of that—
three-quarters of a billion—was specifi-
cally designed to push Russia back,
part of the European Reassurance Ini-
tiative projects in Eastern Europe and
Europe to specifically push Putin away
from NATO.
Other projects have been described
here, all of them deemed to be essen-
tially important for the security of
this Nation.
That is not all. There was another al-
most $3 billion that came out of the op-
erations of the military. Nearly $6 bil-
lion was ripped out of our military, all
of it necessary for the security of this
Nation, and repurposed for the border
wall.
The fundamental issue here is not
about an emergency. It is not about
the emergency powers of the President.
Although, we certainly ought to cir-
cumscribe those. This is very, very
much about the way in which the cur-
rent emergency power is being used.
First, to circumvent the appropriate
constitutional and necessary power of
the Congress to do appropriations, that
power should not ever reside with the
President, but that is exactly what he
has used this emergency appropriation
to accomplish, to grab the power of the
purse, to take that power, that essen-
tial power, as Madison said, from the
Congress, and then specifically, and
most dramatically and dangerously,
harm the security of this Nation by
stopping necessary construction
projects that the military says we need
to protect NATO against Putin and
Russia.
We ought to pass this simply to re-
gather the power that we must have to
be a coequal branch of government, the
power of the purse.
We can debate emergencies. We can
appropriate money for the border, and
we do. But to allow the President to
use this power to usurp the funda-
mental constitutional authority of
Congress is wrong. Therefore, we
must—we must. We have no choice. If
we believe in the work and our oath,
we have no choice but to pass this reso-
lution.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, it is in-
teresting that the gentleman from
California (Mr. GARAMENDI) would sug-
gest that this President ripped this
from Congress. We willingly gave it to
him under section 2808.
The gentleman knows all too well
that if he didn’t want the money going
to the border, he could have done a
limitation amendment when they
passed the funding bill—not once, but
twice. The same funding bill that the
gentleman voted for, he could have put
a limitation bill on it.
This whole thing about the Constitu-
tion is actually about a section that
has been exercised not just by Presi-
dent Trump, but by President Barack
Obama. When President Barack Obama
exercised it, there was not a peep from
the other side, not a peep.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.
BISHOP), my colleague from the Ninth
Congressional District.
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for
yielding.
Mr. Speaker, having taken my seat
in this Congress on behalf of the citi-
zens of the Ninth District only last
week, I am experiencing already that
the majority is prone to theater, in
this case, a show vote for which the
majority lacks the two-thirds nec-
essary to override a promised Presi-
dential veto.
It is the first time I have had an op-
portunity to vote on it, so I will take
the opportunity to declare the south-
ern border is indeed an emergency be-
cause Democrats have sundered and
blocked effective border protection,
border security, for over 30 years.
It is not the emergency that is fake;
it is this futile vote. It is the sudden,
professed concern for men and women
of our armed services.
We saw it yesterday, the majority’s
concern for our armed services, when it
preferred electronic medical records for
illegals over EMR for our vets. Our
servicemembers know who is pro-
tecting their interests and who has
their backs.
As for me, I am with the President.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GARAMENDI).
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, the
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.
MEADOWS), my good friend, is a true
conservative. I know him. I know him
well. We have had many, many discus-
sions. The gentleman is a true conserv-
ative, and he really does believe in the
Constitution.
The gentleman made a most inter-
esting argument that, in the legisla-
tion that ended the 35-day Trump shut-
down, we should have put into that leg-
islation prohibitions on this. Yes, in-
deed, we should have, had we any idea
whatsoever that the President would so
abuse the emergency authority as to
literally rip away from Congress our
appropriations powers.
Keep in mind that we specifically put
legislation and money forward for the
border wall that solved the 35-day shut-
down. The President signed that bill
and then used the emergency power
that is the subject of this debate and
this resolution to usurp our appropria-
tions power.
He did that by going into the mili-
tary and taking nearly $6 billion. And I
understand he is looking for another
$10 billion or so from the same source,
using the same power.
This is a direct attack on our appro-
priations power.
Now, we have an emergency. You
want to talk about an emergency? We
are willing to work on emergencies and
appropriate the necessary money. We
have done so many times. In fact, there
once was an offer for some $20-plus bil-
lion for all of this.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, the gentleman, before
he exits—I want to make sure I am ad-
dressing you, Mr. Speaker, but I want-
ed to highlight one critical part.
He is exactly right, that the Presi-
dent signed this. If the President had
not given the other side the warning
that he was going to declare a national
emergency, then the gentleman would

have had a valid point, Mr. Speaker.
But I can tell you, before the President
signed it, he said: If we do not get the
money to secure our southern border
and make sure that communities are
safer, I am going to declare a national
emergency.
So, he put the Democrats on notice.
That is why all this outrage is inter-
esting. Go back and Google it. I prom-
ise you that they were on notice. He
said: I am going to declare a national
emergency.
This is not about ripping constitu-
tional power. This is about yielding the
power. And my Democratic colleagues
did exactly that.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS),
who probably knows more about the
border than anyone who has spoken
previously from our side because he has
been down there over and over again.
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentleman for yielding time to me.
I will just tell you, I spent at least a
couple weeks on the border this year
alone, multiple times. I have been in
every facility that I can find, and I get
down there as often as I can. I talk al-
most daily to folks who live along the
border.
I would get a chuckle, if it weren’t so
doggone serious, when I hear people
say: Oh, no, there are no drugs coming
across the border. We are getting them
on the ocean.
I will tell you one thing: In the Tuc-
son sector, 40 percent of the drugs that
come into this country from the south,
they come in through the Tucson sec-
tor. You know why? There are 75 miles
of open border. You have one port of
entry. It has a fence, about a mile-and-
a-half on each side of it. Then you have
single-strand barbed wire for as far as
you can see. You have four-strand
barbed wire. You know what it is hold-
ing it up to? It is coming up to the
bollard fencing. It has a slipknot, in
case you need to get into the country.
You can stand there and look at the
five paths that come across. They all
come right to the place where the slip-
knot is.
I will tell you one thing: If you have
a problem with an emergency declara-
tion, then you just simply don’t know
what an emergency is.
Mr. Speaker, 1.1 million people have
surrendered or have been apprehended
at the border this year.
b 1015
Another million or so—we don’t even
know—have come across. We even let
1.2 million people come in legally this
year.
And you want to tell me you don’t
have a border crisis? You have got
opioid addiction and overdoses killing
people. You have got people coming in
unvetted.
You had 1,000 people come in from
where? The Congo—the Congo—right
through the Rio Grande Valley.
I am telling you something: For you
to stand there and say you don’t think
this is an emergency means you just
simply aren’t paying attention.
And this President has the author-
ity—because Congress delegated that
authority to the President of the
United States of America—to deal with
emergencies, and this becomes a true
crisis, a true emergency.
I will just give you one thing.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
the gentleman from Arizona an addi-
tional 1 minute.
Mr. BIGGS. I was at one place, the
most remote border entry we have got
in the entire country. It is only open 9
to 4.
We have three customs agents as-
signed there. We have got one Border
Patrol agent who actually lives there
in a double-wide mobile home. I won’t
say what his name is. Let’s just say it
is Bob.
The night before I got there, 2 a.m.,
255 people, cartel-driven—because there
is no place for 30 miles, 40 miles. That
is the nearest town. So, 250 people were
dropped off, and they all go up and
knock on the door of the double-wide.
They are reading from a paper. They
say: ‘‘Bob, we declare asylum.’’
I talked to an agent. He tells me that
he has been exposed, in the last 6
weeks, to hepatitis A, B, and C; mea-
sles; mumps; lice; scabies; and he said:
‘‘Don’t forget, a skin-eating bacteria
that they haven’t been able to identify
yet.’’
That is not a border crisis? You don’t
want to address that? I am telling you,
it needs to be addressed. It needs to be
addressed today.
I thank the President for having the
courage to do it. You know what? If
you want more money, get him more
money for the Coast Guard. I will sup-
port that.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, may I
inquire how much time remains on
both sides.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from North Carolina has 81⁄2
minutes remaining. The gentleman
from Oregon has 6 minutes remaining.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
On his last rejoinder, my good friend
and colleague said that the President
said something about declaring an
emergency.
Well, the President says an awful lot
of things that he doesn’t do, so I don’t
know how we were supposed to give
credibility to that.
He said Mexico—he said, probably a
hundred times, maybe more than a
hundred times: ‘‘Mexico is going to pay
for the wall.’’
‘‘Who is going to pay for the wall?’’
‘‘Mexico.’’
I mean, he got cheers. He just would
brighten up, this was so wonderful.
But, of course, that is not happening.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON
LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Oregon for
the time.
It may have been 200 times that the
President said that Mexico would pay
for the wall, but here we are today.
I rise to support S.J. Res. 54.
I want the American people to know,
$3.6 billion is coming out of your
United States military, the men and
women, your children, your husbands
and wives that you send to faraway
places and to the bases where families
live. That is what is happening.
Now, as a Texan and a Member of the
Homeland Security Committee, since
the heinous act of 9/11, I probably have
been to the border more times than I
can count. I have walked across. I have
ridden in speed boats. I have watched
the officers deal with the issues at the
border, and I have asked and watched
as they have interdicted drugs.
Drugs don’t come in large numbers
across the border. They come through
legal points of entry. And our men and
women have been very successful in
doing that.
But let me tell you what we are fac-
ing:
A 1957 structure on the Portsmouth,
Virginia, shipyard known as Building
510 has been cited for numerous life
safety violations. That is where your
young Navy personnel are—life safety
violations. It has threatened the well-
being of hundreds of workers if not
heavily renovated.
The Navy warned in its budget re-
quest to Congress: The building has
been labeled a high-risk environment,
largely due to fire safety concerns.
So do you know what they have
done? To compensate for the risk of
fire, the Navy has been reassigning
workers to staff roving fire watches
around the clock, 7 days a week.
They have been cut out for getting
their money. Childcare centers have
been cut out for the men and women in
the United States military, for getting
their money, when we know that bor-
der crossings of desperate people are
down.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD
a September 7, 2019, article from The
Washington Post.

PROJECTS DEFUNDED FOR TRUMP’S BORDER
WALL INCLUDE MILITARY BUILDINGS WITH
‘LIFE SAFETY VIOLATIONS’ AND HAZMAT
CONCERNS
(By Aaron Gregg and Paul Sonne)
The U.S. Navy has been forced to stand
down on construction projects meant to fix
‘‘life safety violations’’ and fire risks at di-
lapidated ship maintenance buildings and
hazardous materials warehouses in Virginia
after funds were diverted to pay for Presi-
dent Trump’s border wall.
The pending construction projects at Nor-
folk Navy Shipyard are among 127 that the
Pentagon has defunded to free up $3.6 billion
in funding for fences and barriers on the
southern border with Mexico using emer-
gency powers.
One of the military facilities—a 1957 struc-
ture on the Portsmouth, Va., shipyard
known as ‘‘Building #510’’—had been cited
for numerous ‘‘life safety violations’’ that
threatened the well-being of hundreds of
workers if not heavily renovated, the Navy
warned in its budget request to Congress last
year.

The building has been labeled a ‘‘high risk
environment,’’ largely due to fire safety con-
cerns. As of last year it had no sprinkler pro-
tection, inadequate fire alarm systems and
not enough exits. Excessive heat and humid-
ity inside have caused equipment problems
despite a 60-ton portable HVAC system
brought in to clear the air, according to
Navy budget documents.
To compensate for the risk of fire, the
Navy had been reassigning workers to staff
‘‘roving fire watches’’ around the clock,
seven days a week. The budget request
sought to revamp the building, including re-
locating personnel overseeing nuclear con-
tainment and repairing Navy life rafts from
an even more dangerous building.
If the building isn’t replaced, the Navy
wrote in its 2018 request, ‘‘approximately 330
personnel, working more than 256,000
manhours annually will remain in a high
risk environment, with continuing signifi-
cant rework, high stress, and additional op-
erating costs due to inadequate working en-
vironment.’’ The Navy received $26 million
from Congress for a construction project
that would have upgraded the building, only
to see that funding taken away to pay for
Trump’s border wall project.
The project is one of eight military con-
struction projects in Maryland and Virginia
that will lose $155 million in funding being
diverted to construct fencing and barriers
along the southern border.
The episode highlights how long-neglected
military facilities that suffered under the se-
questration-induced budget restrictions are
now being buffeted by a different political
head wind.
The defunded projects include a Maryland
child-care facility for soldiers’ children, Vir-
ginia warehouses designed to hold hazardous
materials and a secure facility for classified
cyberwarfare operations. They are among 127
military construction projects across 23
states, three U.S. territories and 20 countries
that have been sidelined to pay for fencing
and barriers on the border with Mexico.
Shooting ranges, airfields, drone facilities,
schools, a missile field and a treatment cen-
ter for working dogs are among the projects
that have seen their funding rescinded.
Members of Congress representing Mary-
land and Virginia said the diversion of funds
will hurt U.S. national security.
‘‘I’m deeply concerned about President
Trump’s plan to pull funding from critical
national security projects—including mil-
lions of dollars from important projects in
Virginia—so he can build his border wall,’’
Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said in a statement.
His state will lose an estimated $89 million
in funded projects to pay for the wall effort,
making it one of the most affected.
Trump declared a national emergency in
mid-February after Congress refused to give
him the sum he wanted for border barrier
construction. An obscure U.S. Code section
governing the military allows the defense
secretary, in the event of a national emer-
gency requiring the use of the armed forces,
to carry out construction projects in support
of those troops without approval from Con-
gress. The statute permits the defense sec-
retary to take money that Congress has
given the Pentagon for other military
projects that have yet to start contracting.
Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper on Tues-
day determined that 11 border barrier
projects proposed by the Department of
Homeland Security would support troops de-
ployed to the border, and authorized the
Pentagon to divert $3.6 billion from 127 mili-
tary projects to finance them. On the cam-
paign trail, Trump regularly said Mexico
would pay for his planned wall along the
southern border.
For the defunded projects to proceed, Con-
gress must once again appropriate funds for
them. Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill
broadly support ‘‘backfilling’’ the $3.6 billion
worth of projects, and the Republican-led
Senate has included a provision to do so in
its version of the annual defense policy bill.
Democrats, however, have balked at the sug-
gestion, saying Trump’s action flies in the
face of Congress’s constitutionally mandated
power of the purse. Democratic lawmakers,
including Kaine, have argued that ‘‘back-
filling’’ the projects would set a precedent
allowing any future president to do an end
run around Congress when confronted with
funding he or she deems insufficient.
Top Pentagon officials say they are com-
mitted to making sure the defunded projects
are still completed, and say they will work
with Congress to ensure that the funding for
the projects is replenished. Still, they have
admitted there is no guarantee the funding
will be forthcoming.
The Portsmouth ship repair facility is part
of the Norfolk Navy Shipyard, the U.S.
Navy’s oldest shipyard, where workers repair
and build naval vessels ranging from sub-
marines to aircraft carriers. Among other
activities, federal workers and contractors
there are responsible for maintaining nu-
clear-powered aircraft carriers and sub-
marines, as well as disposing of the radio-
active waste they generate. The shipyard
processed approximately 8,000 cubic feet of
radioactive solid waste from nuclear sub-
marines between 2013 and 2017, according to
a recent report from the Energy Department.
But the infrastructure supporting the U.S.
military’s nuclear waste disposal efforts has
crumbled in recent decades under successive
waves of budget restrictions. In some cases,
that work has been carried out using anti-
quated 40–year-old pipes, valves and tanks,
according to a 2011 budget document.
Other projects that have been sidelined in
favor of the border wall include $41 million
for a pair of ‘‘noncombustible hazardous ma-
terials warehouses’’ at the Norfolk shipyard.
One of the warehouses was to include a new
storage shed for gas cylinders; according to
Navy budget documents, the existing one is
too small and doesn’t have the necessary fire
safety systems.
The Norfolk warehouses currently being
used to store hazardous materials ‘‘are World
War II-era structures that are inefficient and
not designed for HAZMAT warehouse oper-
ations,’’ Navy officials wrote.
‘‘If this project is not provided, [the De-
fense Department] will continue storing haz-
ardous materials in nonconforming storage
facilities that do not meet current life safety
/fire safety code requirements,’’ Defense offi-
cials told members of Congress in 2018.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, we
recognize that this border wall, over
and over again, has been said to be des-
ignated as an action of the sovereign
nation of Mexico. Why, then, are the
people of the United States, the tax-
payers, voting for something that was
promised by someone else?
Vote for this resolution and help the
men and women in the United States
military. Stand with them. Stand with
them.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of our
Constitution and in defense of our republic
and urge all members to join me in voting for
S.J. Res. 54, which terminates the phony dec-
laration of emergency issued by the President
on February 15, 2019.
The reason this resolution is before us
today is because of the petulant intransigence
of a single person, the current President of the
United States.
As a senior member of the Committee on
the Judiciary and the Committee on Homeland
Security, I visited the southern border on nu-
merous occasions several times and can state
confidently that there is no national emergency
or national security crisis that justified the
President’s reckless and unconstitutional deci-
sion or compels the Congress to abdicate its
responsibilities under Article I to check and
balance the Executive Branch.
The President only pursued this tactic of de-
claring a national emergency after realizing
that Speaker NANCY PELOSI was absolutely
correct when she informed him that he did not
have the support in Congress to require the
taxpayers to pay for his broken promise that
‘‘Mexico would pay for the wall, 100 percent!’’
In fact, according to public opinion polling,
Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the
President’s national emergency declaration by
a 61%–36% margin.
The President’s decision is opposed by both
men and women in every region of the coun-
try, by every income group and education cat-
egory; it is opposed by veterans organizations,
education associations like the NEA and AFT,
and organized labor.
National security experts across the political
spectrum are unanimous in their assessment
that the situation on the southern border does
not constitute a national emergency, an as-
sessment echoed by leading former Repub-
lican senators and Members of Congress.
They understand that after failing to con-
vince the American people or Congress to pay
for his ineffective, wasteful, and immoral multi-
billion dollar concrete wall, the President now
embarked on a course of conduct that is
deeply corrosive of the constitutional system
of checks and balances wisely established by
the Framers and which has served this Nation
and the world so well for nearly 250 years.
Having failed miserably to achieve his ob-
jective in the constitutional legislative process,
the President resorted to a desperate 11th
hour end-run around Congress with an unlaw-
ful emergency declaration that contravenes
the will of the American people and negates
the awesome power of the purse vested ex-
clusively in the Congress of the United States.
The Congress will not tolerate this.
Despite being repeatedly admonished and
in the face of overwhelming evidence to the
contrary, the President continues to propagate
false information regarding the state of our
southern border.
Mr. Speaker, these are the facts.
NET UNAUTHORIZED MIGRATION FROM MEXICO
HAS FALLEN TO ZERO
Net migration from Mexico is now zero or
slightly below (more people leaving than com-
ing) because of a growing Mexican economy,
an aging population and dropping fertility rates
that have led to a dramatic decrease in unau-
thorized migration from Mexico.
TOTAL APPREHENSIONS ARE LOW AND
MANAGEABLE
Migrant apprehensions continue to be near
an all-time low with only a slight increase from
2017.
The combined 521,090 apprehensions for
Border Patrol and Customs agents in fiscal
year 2018 were 32,288 apprehensions fewer
than the 553,378 apprehensions in 2016.
To put this in perspective, on average, each
of the 19,437 Border Patrol agents nationwide
apprehended a total of only 19 migrants in
2018, which amounts to fewer than 2 appre-
hensions per month.
In the last few years, an increased propor-
tion of apprehensions are parents seeking to

protect their children from the violence and ex-
treme poverty in Honduras, El Salvador, and
Guatemala.
But even with more Central Americans arriv-
ing to our southern border seeking protection,
total apprehension rates are still at their lowest
since the 1970s.
The absence of a massive wall on the
southern border will not solve the drug smug-
gling problem because, as all law enforcement
experts agree, the major source of drugs com-
ing into the United States are smuggled
through legal ports of entry.
BORDER COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE
The southern border region is home to
about 15 million people living in border coun-
ties in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and
Texas.
These communities, which include cities
such as San Diego, Douglas, Las Cruces, and
El Paso, are among the safest in the country.
CONGRESS HAS INVESTED BILLIONS IN BORDER
ENFORCEMENT
Congress has devoted more U.S. taxpayer
dollars to immigration enforcement agencies
(more than $21 billion now) than all other en-
forcement agencies combined, including the
FBI, DEA, ATF, US Marshals, and Secret
Service.
The bulk of this money goes to U.S. Cus-
toms and Border Protection (CBP), with a
budget of $14.4 billion in fiscal year 2018 and
more than 59,000 personnel.
CBP is the largest law enforcement agency
in the country, and more than 85 percent of
the agency’s Border Patrol agents (i.e., 16,605
of 19,437) are concentrated on the southern
border.
Expanded deployment of the military to the
border to include active duty troops could cost
between $200 and $300 million in addition to
the estimated $182 million for the earlier de-
ployment by the President of National Guard
to the border.
Mr. Speaker, having been soundly defeated
legislatively by Congress, a co-equal branch of
government, the President wants to finance
border wall vanity project by diverting funds
that the Congress has appropriated for dis-
aster recovery and military construction.
The funds the President wants to steal were
appropriated by Congress to help Americans
devastated by natural disasters, like Hurri-
canes Harvey, Irma and Maria, or for other
purposes like military construction.
Congress did not, has not, and will not, ap-
prove of any diversion of these funds to con-
struct a border wall that the President repeat-
edly and derisively boasted that Mexico would
pay for.
In fact, the President has admitted he
‘‘didn’t have to do this,’’ but has opted do so
because ‘‘I want to see it built faster.’’
Mr. Speaker, a bipartisan group of nearly 60
national security officials including former sec-
retaries of state, defense secretaries, CIA di-
rectors, and ambassadors to the UN issued a
statement declaring that ‘‘there is no factual
basis’’ justifying the President’s emergency
declaration.
Instead of protecting our national security,
the President’s declaration makes America
less safe.
The President is stealing billions from high-
priority military construction projects that en-
sure our troops have the essential training,
readiness and quality of life necessary to keep
the American people safe, directly under-
mining America’s national security.
Mr. Speaker, on September 4, 2019, citing
his emergency declaration, the President an-
nounced 127 military construction projects
being canceled to pay for construction of the
wall.
These 127 projects are critical to protecting
our national security and improving the quality
of life of our servicemembers and their fami-
lies.
President Trump’s cancellation of these
projects makes America less safe, disrespects
military families, and dishonors the Constitu-
tion.
A recent U.S. Air Force report also high-
lighted the security risks posed from the Presi-
dent’s cancellation of various Air Force military
construction projects, including:
1. Cancelling military construction for the
European Defense Initiative, preventing our
work to deter Russian aggression.
2. Cancelling maintenance at a key base in
the Middle East to fix weaknesses that leave
us open ‘‘to hostile penetration in the midst of
contingency operations and an increased ter-
rorist threat.’’
3. Cancelling planned upgrades of airfields
across Europe, leaving them unable to support
U.S. and NATO planes.
Mr. Speaker, the President’s declaration
clearly violates the Congress’s exclusive
power of the purse, and, if unchecked, would
fundamentally alter the balance of powers, vio-
lating our Founders’ vision for America.
Opposing the President’s reckless and anti-
American decision transcends partisan politics
and partisanship; it is about patriotism, con-
stitutional fidelity, and putting country first.
To quote Thomas Paine’s Common Sense:
‘‘In absolute governments, the King is law; so
in free countries, the law ought to be King.’’
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to uphold
the rule of law and the Constitution and reject
the President’s power grab; I urge a resound-
ing ‘‘yes’’ vote on S.J. Res. 54.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, only in
Washington, D.C., is spending $160 bil-
lion more on defense a cut. The gentle-
woman from Texas is talking like we
have cut the defense. We are spending
$160 billion more over a 2-year period.
Ask the military men and women if
they are better funded today than they
were under the 8 years of the Barack
Obama administration, and, almost to
the person, they will say yes. This
President is standing with the military
men and women of this great country.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN).
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, this is
just one more example of the Demo-
crats attacking the President instead
of trying to solve the problem.
We all know how serious the problem
was. We have known it for months and
months and months. For months, we
said there was a crisis on the southern
border, and the Democrats said: No, no,
no, not really a crisis. It is manufac-
tured. It is not real.
Even though there were 144 apprehen-
sions in the month of May alone, they
said: Oh, no, no—manufactured.
Finally, the real crisis got so ex-
treme, even the Democrats had to say:
You know what? That money the Presi-
dent is asking for, we are going to have
to give him a little money. We are
going to have to do something here.
They put all kinds of strings on it,
but they finally admitted there was a
real crisis on the border. But they lim-
ited what the President could do.
In the broader context, never forget
what they have said. They said: Abol-
ish ICE. Members of the United States
Congress: Abolish ICE.
We had a Member from the majority
say to abolish the whole Department.
We had the Speaker of the House, even
though she has a wall in her own State,
say walls are immoral.
The majority says they are okay
with noncitizens voting. This is the
perspective they offer, and now they
bring this bill?
Of course we should vote against this
thing. Of course we should vote against
this thing.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I believe
I have the right to close. I have no fur-
ther speakers, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from North
Carolina (Mr. MURPHY), the gentleman
from the Third Congressional District
of North Carolina, one who has actu-
ally been a strong advocate for the hur-
ricane relief that has hit his particular
district, the new Member and my good
friend.
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, I speak this morning on our
Nation’s security.
Over 200-plus years ago, brave men
and women literally sacrificed their
lives to create a nation that was based
upon freedom. That has now continued,
and we have today a nation of laws.
And now we have that nation of laws
and the sanctity of that country
threatened.
If you look back on the last several
Republican and Democratic Presidents
of the United States who, right from
that very seat, spoke about our border
crisis, they spoke about what they
needed to do to keep the sanctity of
our borders, yet nothing was ever done.
The American people have com-
plained incessantly on how this Con-
gress does not act. It is a stalemate.
Now we have a President, bold as he is,
who is finally acting on this crisis. We
are literally overrun by folks from the
southern border.
Yes, there are drugs. I heard that was
mentioned by the gentleman earlier.
There are drugs that are coming in.
But we also talk about human traf-
ficking, that is, the trafficking of
young men and women into this coun-
try into, essentially, slavery. We now
want to open the borders up and have
this country, what was previously a na-
tion of laws, now become overrun and
say that laws are no longer sanctified
in this country.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a
President who is bold, who has recog-
nized what has not been recognized by
previous Presidents, that we do have
an emergency, that we do have the
need for a physical structure to pre-
vent a physical object from moving
from point A to point B.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8070 September 27, 2019
We need a sanctified and a secure
border, and I wish the Republicans and
Democrats would get together and rec-
ognize that we do need this for our
country and it is truly an emergency.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, as I said
earlier, I have the right to close. I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume. If
the gentleman opposite has no more
speakers and is prepared to close, I will
go ahead and give my final remarks.
Mr. Speaker, I think it would be ap-
propriate for me to recognize our fine
staff that is here. All those who have
prepared the work have done a great
job, day in and day out. Many times,
our staff is looked at and overlooked,
and I didn’t want this day to go by
without recognizing their fine work on
this particular subject.
Mr. Speaker, it should come as no
surprise to the American people or to
this body why we are here today. Every
single day, Mr. Speaker, it becomes
clearer and clearer and clearer that the
majority is just blindly objecting to
anything that this President does, even
if those efforts are to serve this Nation.
The fact is that there is a real crisis
at our southern border, something that
even the Speaker, as recently as June,
has recognized. So, Mr. Speaker, I
think it is important that we come to-
gether and we do secure our commu-
nities, we do provide the funding.
I am willing to work with my friends
opposite. If we are looking at our Coast
Guard, wanting to make sure that they
have the proper funds, I am willing to
work with them on that.
I am also willing to look at what we
need to do to make sure that we not
only build a secure southern border,
but that we apprehend those cartels
and those human traffickers that my
good friend from North Carolina talked
about.
There is a cost of not doing some-
thing each and every day. My friend
opposite wanted to talk about how the
President really says things and
doesn’t do it.
I can tell you, this President is very
serious about building a wall on our
southern border to secure it. In fact, it
is being built right now.
This President was very serious
about moving the Embassy to Jeru-
salem. In fact, the Embassy is in Jeru-
salem.
This President was very serious
about lowering taxes. In fact, we low-
ered taxes.
This President was very serious
about making sure that our economy
hums so that unemployment would
reach historic lows, and, indeed, he has
done that.
This is not about a campaign promise
to build a wall. This is about a cam-
paign promise to secure our commu-
nities. In fact, this President has done
it.
I am going to stand with him. I ask
my friends opposite to work with us on
giving the proper funding to make sure
that we do exactly that.
Mr. Speaker, it is high time that we
put the interests of the American citi-
zens first, and, with that, I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the remainder of my time.
Well, again, in response to my good
friend, the President said hundreds of
times: Mexico is going to pay for the
wall. They are not.
We have the transcript of the phone
call where he called the new President
of Mexico and said: Look, I know you
are not going to pay for the wall, but
you can’t say that. We are going to pay
for it.
So, that is one thing.
Also, he talked about moving the
Embassy to Jerusalem. The President
was going to deliver a peace plan for
the Middle East. Where is it?
There are a lot of things this Presi-
dent said he was going to do that
haven’t happened.
Getting close to the President is sort
of like being in the orbit of a black
hole, which sucks in everything. And
that sucked in a lot of things and a lot
of people who have been, then, blown
back out at some point by the Presi-
dent.
b 1030
His current Acting Chief of Staff—I
don’t know how long he has been act-
ing now; a year, a year and half, some-
thing like that. The President likes
them to be acting because he can get
rid of them more easily, he thinks.
When he had his own opinions, when
he wasn’t in the orbit of the black hole
of Donald Trump, he said about walls,
Mick Mulvaney, the President’s acting
Chief of Staff: ‘‘You go under, you go
around, you go through. What they
need is more manpower and more tech-
nology.’’ Acting Chief of Staff Mick
Mulvaney said that August 25, 2015,
when he had his own opinions, when he
worked here in the United States
House of Representatives. He can’t
have his own opinions anymore.
He thought a wall was stupid then
and it wouldn’t do anything. And he
said what we have been saying; we in-
spect six percent of the semi-tractor
trailers that roll across the border, and
we have testimony in the conviction of
a drug lord, Joaquin Guzman, in New
York, we have testimony in that trial.
They are bringing the drugs in in just
boatloads, or truckloads, boatloads—
we already talked about the Coast
Guard—and truckloads across the bor-
der because we only inspect a fraction
of them.
So what if they lose a few? Hundreds
of millions of dollars; that is the cost
of doing business. This is a multi-bil-
lion-dollar business, these cartels.
And as Mick Mulvaney said in an
honest moment, we need manpower. We
already heard that they have only got
four people at the border crossing in
Arizona.
Why do they only have four people?
We have appropriated more money for
more Border Patrol people consist-
ently, year in, year out. But they are
way behind in their numbers. They
haven’t been able to hire up to the
numbers we have authorized.
And technology, which is what I am
talking about, they don’t have that ei-
ther.
There is also—I mean, you know,
people over there are pooh-poohing
child care centers for the troops in the
military and things like that. They
don’t need it. Their kids don’t need it.
Really?
And then also the President is taking
hundreds of millions of dollars out of
the European defense initiative.
I have been to Poland recently, and I
have seen the Suwalki Corridor. That
is the Russian invasion route into Eu-
rope. For years it was the Fulda Gap,
but now it is the Suwalki Corridor
since Germany is reunified.
And we are going to cancel projects
in countries to defend that area and
give them better capability to defend
themselves against the Russian inva-
sion.
But since Vlad—that is Mr. Putin,
whatever dictators are called in Rus-
sia—is buddies with the President; they
have secret phone calls, secret con-
versations that aren’t transcribed, the
President is withholding money from
Ukraine to defend itself.
And now we are going to cut money
for our allies, the European defense ini-
tiative, to build a stupid, useless wall
on the border.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time
for debate has expired.

2019 CONGRESSIONAL FOOTBALL
GAME
(Mr. PANETTA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today with my Democratic and Repub-
lican colleagues to present to you, to
present to this body, a trophy that rec-
ognizes something that hasn’t been
done in over a decade.
Now, I am not talking about the 2009
Raise the Wage Act. I am not talking
about the 2009 Hate Crimes Act. I am
not even talking about the creation of
the Office of Congressional Ethics in
2009.
What I am talking about is that
these Congressmen in front of you ac-
tually beat the Capitol Police in foot-
ball on Tuesday night for the first time
in a decade.
Now, at the game, Mr. Speaker, for-
tunately, there were no serious inju-
ries. At practice, there was, but not at
the game.
We had a lot of sore muscles, but
most importantly, we did raise a heck
of a lot of money for local charities and
the Capitol Police Memorial Fund.
So, Mr. Speaker, I present this tro-
phy to you, this rather large trophy to
you, I present it to this body as a re-
ward for that victory, but also a small
reminder of what Democrats and Re-
publicans can do when we work to-
gether.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS).
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I want to say thank you to
everybody standing up here. They came
to practices in the mornings, they
braved serious injuries.
Mr. Speaker, a special shout-out to
our colleague, RICK CRAWFORD, who is
not here, who broke a fibula trying to
play for this game. We missed him.
Mr. Speaker, another shout-out goes
to Bob Dole and Jeff Denham, former
Members who have played, but cer-
tainly our pros that helped coach us,
John Booty and Ken Harvey. All of
them deserve thanks.
Mr. Speaker, I ask all Members,
whenever they see these great Capitol
Police officers, thank them for what
they do each and every day for us and
for the millions of visitors that come
to this institution. But remind them
that the charities are the winners, and
make sure they know that the Mem-
bers are the victors.

JOINT TASK FORCE TO COMBAT
OPIOID TRAFFICKING ACT OF 2019
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the unfin-
ished business is the vote on the mo-
tion to suspend the rules and pass the

Security Act of 2002 to authorize a
Joint Task Force to enhance integra-
tion of the Department of Homeland
Security’s border security operations
to detect, interdict, disrupt, and pre-
vent narcotics, such as fentanyl and
other synthetic opioids, from entering
the United States, and for other pur-
poses, on which the yeas and nays were
ordered.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from California (Mr.
CORREA) that the House suspend the

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
DEGETTE) (during the vote). There are
2 minutes remaining.
b 1113
So (two-thirds being in the affirma-
tive) the rules were suspended and the
bill was passed.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.
Stated for:
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker,
I was unavoidably detained. Had I been
present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall
No. 554.
PERSONAL EXPLANATION
Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I was unable to
have my votes recorded on the House floor on
Thursday, September 26 and Friday, Sep-
tember 27, 2019 due to a family matter. Had
I been present, I would have voted in favor of
H.R. 3525, H.R. 3722, and S.J. Res. 54.
f
RAISING A QUESTION OF THE
PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I
rise to a question of the privileges of
the House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the resolution.
The Clerk read as follows:
Whereas at a press conference on Sep-
tember 24, 2019, Speaker of the House Nancy
Pelosi stated: ‘‘Therefore today, I’m an-
nouncing the House of Representatives is
moving forward with an official impeach-
ment inquiry’’;
Whereas House Practice states that:
‘‘Under the modern practice, an impeach-
ment is normally instituted by the House by
the adoption of a resolution calling for a
committee investigation of charges against
the officer in question’’;
Whereas in the past 25 years, the House of
Representatives has moved forward with im-
peachment against a Federal officer three
times, each initiated by an impeachment in-
quiry resolution approved by the full House,
not by a unilateral decree of the Speaker;
Whereas on May 12, 2009, the House ap-
proved H. Res. 424, authorizing and directing
the Committee on the Judiciary to inquire
whether the House should impeach Samuel
B. Kent, a judge of the United States Dis-
trict Court for the Southern District of
Texas;
Whereas on January 13, 2009, the House ap-
proved H. Res. 15, authorizing and directing
the Committee on the Judiciary to inquire
whether the House should impeach G. Thom-
as Porteous, a judge of the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of
Louisiana;
Whereas on October 8, 1998, the House ap-
proved H. Res. 581, authorizing and directing
the Committee on the Judiciary to inves-
tigate whether sufficient grounds exist for
the impeachment of William Jefferson Clin-
ton, President of the United States;
Whereas the Committee Report to accom-
pany H. Res. 581 stated: ‘‘Because the issue of
impeachment is of such overwhelming im-
portance, the Committee decided that it
must receive authorization from the full
House before proceeding on any further
course of action’’;
Whereas that report further stated: ‘‘Be-
cause impeachment is delegated solely to the
House of Representatives by the Constitu-
tion, the full House of Representatives
should be involved in critical decision mak-
ing regarding various stages of impeach-
ment’’;
Whereas the Speaker’s extraordinary deci-
sion to move forward with an impeachment
inquiry without any debate or vote on such
a resolution by the full House undermines
the voting privileges afforded to each Mem-
ber and the constituents they represent; and
Whereas this unprecedented and politically
motivated decision by Speaker Pelosi rep-
resents an abuse of power and brings dis-
credit to the House of Representatives: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives disapproves of the actions of the Speak-
er of the House, Mrs. Pelosi of California, to
initiate an impeachment inquiry against the
duly elected President of the United States,
Donald J. Trump.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution presents a question of the
privileges of the House.
MOTION TO TABLE
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I have
a motion at the desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the motion.
The Clerk read as follows:
Mr. Hoyer moves that the resolution be
laid on the table.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion to table.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
RECORDED VOTE
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I
demand a recorded vote.
A recorded vote was ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 5-
minute vote on the motion to table
will be followed by a 5-minute vote on
agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of
the Journal, if ordered.
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—ayes 222, noes 184,
not voting 27, as follows:

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

woman from Oklahoma?
There was no objection.

Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that I may here-
after be considered as the first sponsor
of H.R. 3088, a bill originally intro-
duced by Representative DUFFY of Wis-
consin, for the purposes of adding co-

tleman from Wisconsin?

Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that when the
House adjourns today, it adjourn to
meet at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, October 1,

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF
DON KENNEDY
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor the career of a pil-
lar of New England’s law enforcement
community. Don Kennedy served with
honor in the Rhode Island State Police
for 24 years before retiring as a captain
in 1998.
When he left the force, he did not
leave his brethren in blue, though.
Rather, for more than two decades, he
has guided the work of the New Eng-
land State Police Information Net-
work, or NESPIN. As deputy director
of field services, he helped departments
across the Nation with investigations,
and he will be retiring as executive di-
rector of the program.
Don has been a great advocate for the
Federal Regional Information Sharing
Systems program that helps fund
NESPIN. From Don, I have learned the

immense value of networking State po-
lice resources, and my friend Mr. KING
from New York and I have helped en-
sure the program is appropriately fund-
ed by Congress.
Don’s legacy will live on in the RISS
programs that he has helped support
and the communities made safer by
them. As a fellow Rhode Islander, I
wish him the best of luck in this excit-
ing, new, and forthcoming chapter of
his life as he enters retirement.
f
CELEBRATING NATIONAL
RECOVERY MONTH
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I
rise to recognize September as Na-
tional Recovery Month and to cele-
brate the millions of Americans who
are recovering from substance abuse.
Madam Speaker, I would like to
thank my colleagues Representatives
TRONE, RIGGLEMAN, KUSTER, and
FITZPATRICK for leading this initiative.
Like so many communities across
America, my district in east Tennessee
has been affected by the ongoing opioid
crisis. I am proud to work with my fel-
low Members in the Freshman Working
Group on Addiction to bring attention
to the severity of overdoses and how we
can support those in recovery.
Almost 70,000 Americans overdose on
drugs each year, and some 23 million
Americans are recovering from sub-
stance abuse.
Friends, family, local organizations,
and healthcare providers must do ev-
erything they can to combat this hor-
rible addiction, and Congress also
needs to play its part.
I sponsored the Effective Drug Con-
trol Strategy Act to improve federally
funded drug demand reduction pro-
grams and prevent addiction before it
begins. Madam Speaker, the House
should seriously consider this legisla-
tion and the positive impacts it would
have on preventing drug addiction.

CONGRATULATING THE CHAPMAN
UNIVERSITY MEN’S BASEBALL
TEAM AND HEAD COACH SCOTT
LAVERTY
(Mr. CORREA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I
want everyone to join me in congratu-
lating the Chapman University, in my
district, men’s baseball team and head
coach, Scott Laverty, for winning the
NCAA Division III Baseball Tour-
nament.
Congratulations, Panthers.
This is their third national cham-
pionship—the first one in 1968, second
one in 2003. In 2011, they were runner-
up, and in 2019, here they are.
California’s 46th Congressional Dis-
trict is the home of champs. Please
join me in congratulating Chapman
University Panthers on a job well done.
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair will remind all persons in the
gallery that they are here as guests of
the House and that any manifestation
of approval or disapproval of pro-
ceedings is in violation of the rules of
the House.
f
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF IRA LIPMAN
(Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute and to revise
and extend his remarks.)
Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the
remarkable and extraordinary life of
Ira Lipman.
Ira was not only a loyal friend, but
he was a humanitarian, a successful
businessman, and a widely respected
leader by all. Ira was committed to the
city of Memphis and inspired others to
make his hometown a better place to
live.
He founded his company,
Guardsmark, in the city of Memphis,
which grew into the Nation’s largest
privately held security company. He
was recognized as a national leader on
all security matters.
Ira also championed the creation of
the Memphis Shelby County Crime
Commission, which, for more than 20
years, has brought together leaders in
business, government, and law enforce-
ment to address the city’s crime issues.
Ira’s generosity, his wisdom, and his
courage were unparalleled, and I am
lucky to have been able to call him a
friend. Frankly, the world was a better
place with Ira in it.
Ira leaves behind his beloved wife of
49 years, Barbara, as well as three sons.
Indeed, Ira may have rested his head
at night on his pillow in New York
City, but his heart and his soul lived in
Memphis.
f
OPPOSING THE EXPANSION OF
THE ALCANTARA LAUNCH CEN-
TER IN BRAZIL
(Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I rise today in opposition to
the expansion of the Alcantara Launch
Center in Brazil.
This agreement between the Trump
and Bolsonaro administrations threat-
ens to displace hundreds of Afro-Bra-
zilian quilombo families from their
land, further disparaging an already
marginalized community.
Brazil’s Constitution provides ex-
plicit protections for quilombo lands,
and Trump and Bolsonaro are blatantly
disregarding these protections with
this land grab.
Previous expansions of this military
base have displaced over 300 families.
The expansion of that base on
quilombo land will displace some addi-
tional 800 quilombo families from their
constitutionally protected ancestral
land.
I appreciate America’s longstanding
relationship with Brazil; however, I
cannot support policies that dehuman-
ize native people and bring harm to
vulnerable communities in Brazil.
Madam Speaker, I oppose this agree-
ment, and I urge my colleagues to do
the same.
f
REMEMBERING THE LIFE AND
LEGACY OF E.J. HOLUB
(Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the life and leg-
acy of my dear friend and Lubbock leg-
end, E.J. Holub, who passed away Sat-
urday.
E.J. was the pride of Lubbock High
School and one of the best Texas Tech
football players of all time. Some re-
ferred to E.J. as ‘‘The Beast,’’ and I
called him ‘‘Uncle E.J.’’ because he was
one of my dad’s best friends at Texas
Tech and a lifelong member of the
Arrington family.
E.J. was larger than life on and off
the field. His stature and strength on
the gridiron was only rivaled by the
size of his heart for people.
E.J. was a true gentleman and a real
cowboy. He loved his family, his
horses, and all things Texas Tech. He is
leaving behind a tremendous legacy for
west Texas.
To Sandi and E.J.’s girls: Please
know that we love you and are praying
for you.
To Red Raider Nation: Take off your
hats, get your guns up, and join me in
paying tribute to our favorite fearless
champion and Herculean hero, E.J.
‘‘The Beast’’ Holub.
I love you, Uncle E.J.
f
RECOGNIZING 39TH CONGRES-
SIONAL DISTRICT SCHOOLS FOR
THEIR EXCELLENCE
(Mr. CISNEROS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. CISNEROS. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the incredible
performance of schools and students in
the 39th Congressional District in Cali-
fornia.
Yesterday, the Department of Edu-
cation recognized 362 schools across the
country as National Blue Ribbon
Schools for their academic excellence.
I am proud to say that two schools in
my district have received that honor:
Acacia Elementary School and Robert
C. Fisler Elementary School in Ful-
lerton.
This recognition is a testament to
the outstanding work of the teachers,
faculty, staff, students, and families
who, together, create a culture of suc-
cess at our schools.

Additionally, I want to congratulate
the students at the Placentia-Yorba
Linda Unified School District for their
84 percent pass rate on their advanced
placement, or AP, exams, one of the
highest averages in the Nation. They
were included in the prestigious Ad-
vanced Placement District Honor Roll.
Less than 3 percent of school districts
across the country have received this
honor.
As a longtime education advocate, it
is with immense pride that I stand here
able to recognize these schools and
their students for their achievements.
All of these schools and students are
shining examples of academic excel-
lence in the 39th Congressional Dis-
trict, worthy of their national distinc-
tion.
I ask my colleagues to join me in of-
fering my sincerest congratulations.
f
EXPANSION OF 529 EDUCATION
PLANS
(Mr. HAGEDORN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. HAGEDORN. Madam Speaker,
for our economy to continue growing,
workers need technical skills, the right
training, and education funding.
Workforce development is a bipar-
tisan goal, strongly supported by both
employers and employees. Small busi-
nesses, manufacturers, trade unions,
and industry groups are concerned
about the shortage of skilled trade
workers.
Sadly, many seeking technical train-
ing are precluded from using qualified
529 education savings plans, and many
apprenticeships are not eligible for 529
plans as well.
To solve this problem, I am proud to
have introduced H.R. 4469, the Amer-
ican Workforce Employment Act, and I
would like to offer special thanks to
my colleagues, Representatives JEFF
VAN DREW from New Jersey, RON ESTES
from Kansas, and PAUL MITCHELL from
Michigan, for coauthoring this legisla-
tion.
Our bipartisan bill expands the appli-
cation of 529 savings plans to include
expenses leading to postsecondary cre-
dentials, certain apprenticeships, and
the purchase of tools and equipment,
which is very important.
These programs have been identified
as critical by trade unions and manu-
facturers. Empowering men and women
to utilize their own pretax dollars will
increase the number of highly trained
individuals pursuing high-wage voca-

THE SHORTAGE OF SKILLED
WORKERS
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I
am here today to bring attention to
the American Workforce Empower-
ment Act which I worked on with my
friend from Minnesota, Congressman
JIM HAGEDORN.
This is a bipartisan solution—and I
hope everybody heard the word bipar-
tisan—to address the growing shortage
of skilled workers to fill job openings
in the technical and skilled trades.
Small businesses are in need of ma-
chinists, welders, truck drivers, and an
array of other qualified trades and
labor-intensive professions. We should
do everything we can to incentivize
technical skills training and appren-
ticeships for those who like to work
with their hands and see the product of
their hard work.
The bipartisan American Workforce
Empowerment Act expands these pro-
grams eligible for payment by 529 sav-
ings plans, and by making registered
apprenticeships eligible, we can more
easily and readily close the wide gap of
good-paying positions that have gone
unfilled in our robust economy.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to cosponsor H.R. 4469. We need
to expand our workforce, and this is a
great way to do it.

RECOGNIZING BEDFORD COUNTY
SHERIFF MIKE BROWN AND DR.
JANET BROWN
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Bedford County
Sheriff Mike Brown and his wife, Lib-
erty University professor, Dr. Janet
Brown, for their tireless efforts to com-
bat human trafficking and human sex-
ual slavery throughout the world.
The Browns founded the Safe Surfin’
Foundation in 1998 with the mission to
educate youth and teens about the dan-
gers of the internet and social media.
In May the Browns were invited to
present a program they developed
called Cyber Safety While Accessing
Technology, or Cyber S.W.A.T., to the
Global Sustainability Network at the
Vatican.
Cyber S.W.A.T. utilizes the social
cognitive theory, a means of education,
where students learn by observing and
imitating the behavior of their peers.
This program was first launched at Jef-
ferson Forest High School in Lynch-
burg, Virginia, where students received
training and designed presentations for
their classmates about online threats.
The response was outstanding, and
since then the program has been imple-
mented in eight other high schools
across the country.
Cyber S.W.A.T. has the potential not
only to save lives in the United States,
but around the world.
I want to thank the Browns for their
efforts to protect the next generation
by teaching them proper internet safe-
ty, and I look forward to watching the
continued success of the Cyber
S.W.A.T. program.

NATIONAL CHOCOLATE MILK DAY
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize September 27 as National Choco-
late Milk Day. Chocolate milk is
adored by millions of Americans na-
tionwide, and it is a favorite among
children. Seventy percent of the milk
children consume is flavored, with
chocolate being the most popular.
Why?
Because chocolate milk is low in fat,
high in nutrients, and packed with fla-
vor.
Milk consumption has been declin-
ing, however, and when the National
School Lunch Program removed the
most popular and the most nutritious
options from the schools to serve only
fat-free milk, the numbers continued
to drop. This was partially reversed by
the USDA when the decision was made
to, once again, allow 1 percent flavored
milk back in school lunches.
To build on this momentum, I intro-
duced the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids
Act earlier this year to once again
allow whole milk—both flavored and
unflavored—to be offered within the
program because children can greatly
benefit from the essential nutrients
whole milk provides.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to celebrate National Choco-
late Milk Day accordingly.

FRUITLESS INVESTIGATIONS IN-
VOLVING THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1

marks.)
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I rise
to reflect on what could have been ac-
complished in the past 9 months on
this House floor.
The list is staggering: border secu-
rity and illegal immigration reform;
lower drug costs and lower premiums
and deductibles for families; correcting
surprise billing; making the middle
class tax cut permanent; passing a ro-
bust infrastructure transportation bill;
promoting free, fair, and reciprocal
trade globally; and passing the United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and
other America-first, but not-America-
alone, trade agreements, which will
grow our domestic industry and agri-
cultural exports.

fruitless investigations aimed at reliti-
gating the 2016 Presidential election.
Every one of these investigations has
produced the same result: nothing.
The majority party has wasted its
own time and, much more seriously,
the time of the people who sent us
here.
House Democrats are now grasping at
one last desperate effort: an impeach-
ment inquiry over a baseless, second-
hand account. This farce, which choos-
es to push a presumption of guilt where
evidence is nonexistent, is nothing
short of a constitutional embarrass-
ment for our country.
May God continue to bless the United
States of America.

RECOGNIZING DOROTHY HUKILL
(Mr. WALTZ asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, 1 year
ago, on October 2, Volusia County,
Florida, lost one of its greatest public
servants, Dorothy Hukill.
Dorothy Hukill was a servant leader
who dedicated more than two decades
of her life serving our community,
working tirelessly to improve the lives
of residents in our area.
She served as a councilwoman of
Ponce Inlet before becoming the mayor
of Port Orange. She then headed to the
Florida House of Representatives. It
was there that she fought for education
and financial literacy, encouraging
high school students to take courses on
money management.
Dorothy didn’t care about the spot-
light. She preferred to be quiet, yet ef-
fective. She was always on her A game,
and she truly cared about her constitu-
ents. Dorothy didn’t see people as Re-
publicans, Democrats, or Independents.
She understood the need to work with
everyone, and she truly cared about
her community and the people she rep-
resented.
Dorothy would put up welcome signs
for people in our community who often
planned months in advance to travel to
Florida’s capitol in Tallahassee.
Madam Speaker, she was a true ex-
ample of a servant leader. She sought
to inspire others to make her commu-
nity a better place, and she is missed
dearly. It is my honor to recognize her
on the floor of the House of Represent-
atives today.

BUS DRIVER SAFETY AND
SECURITY MONTH
(Mr. TIPTON asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to invite my colleagues to join
my call designating September 2019 as
School Bus Safety and Security Month.
Earlier this month, I introduced a
resolution to honor and show my ap-
preciation to the more than half a mil-
lion school bus drivers across the coun-
try.
Over 26 million children rely on pub-
lic school transportation to get them
safely to and from school each year,
and September is the perfect month to
thank these drivers for keeping our
kids safe as they return to school.
In rural districts like Colorado’s
Third Congressional District, many of
these drivers find themselves driving
great distances facing inclement
weather, wildlife, and other hazards
that make driving difficult, yet they
work tirelessly to ensure safe transpor-
tation of our children.
Madam Speaker, I would also like to
commend the Child Safety Network for
their 30 years of commitment to Amer-
ica’s children and promoting this reso-
lution. I am truly appreciative of their
advocacy on behalf of school safety,
and I thank my colleagues who have
joined as cosponsors for this important
resolution.
f
RECOGNIZING TALLADEGA SUPER-
SPEEDWAY IN TALLADEGA, ALA-
BAMA
(Mr. ROGERS of Alabama asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam
Speaker, today I ask for the House’s
attention to recognize the 50th anni-
versary of the Talladega 500 Super-
speedway in Talladega, Alabama.
In the mid-1960s, NASCAR founder
Bill France, Sr., envisioned a bigger
and faster track on the NASCAR cir-
cuit. After meeting with local race car
driver and fan Bill Ward of Anniston,
Alabama, the location was selected for
the track, and the groundbreaking
ceremony for the Alabama Inter-
national Motor Speedway—today
known as the Talladega Superspeed-
way—took place on May 23, 1968.
The first race, the Talladega 500, was
held on September 14, 1969, with Rich-
ard Brickhouse winning that race. I
had the good fortune to be in attend-
ance that day with my dad. The race
played a major role in NASCAR’s his-
tory, as many of the top stars of the
sport walked out the day before the
race due to concerns over tire wear on
the 200-mile-per-hour track. Mr. France
said the race would go on and recruited
drivers from the smaller NASCAR
Touring Series, the Bama 400, the day
before to replace them.
The Talladega Superspeedway is the
most competitive racetrack on the
NASCAR schedule, the highest banked,
and the longest, as well as the most fan
friendly.
Madam Speaker, please join me in
recognizing the anniversary of the
Talladega Superspeedway.

RECOGNIZING EXODIE C. ROE, III
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCNERNEY) is recognized
for 60 minutes as the designee of the
majority leader.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that Members
have 5 days to revise and extend their
remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I
rise to recognize the dedicated public
servant and congressional aide, Exodie
C. Roe, III, who has been instrumental
in helping me serve the constituents of
California’s Ninth and Eleventh Con-
gressional Districts.
Exodie C. Roe, III was born in Stock-
ton, California, to Exodie C. Roe, Jr.
and LaJuana Johnson Bivens. He cred-
its his mother and his nonbiological fa-
ther, Robert ‘‘Bobby’’ Bivens, Sr., as
his inspiration for pursuing a career in
public service.
Exodie is a 2002 graduate of Stagg
High School in Stockton and a 2006
graduate of Dillard University in New
Orleans, Louisiana. This year he was
honored by Dillard University with the
‘‘40 Under 40’’ award for his public serv-
ice achievements.
Exodie began his service in my
Stockton office as a field representa-
tive when I was first elected in 2007. In
this role he developed the first major
congressional foreclosure assistance
workshop in the country that helped
more than 500 residents and hundreds
more through subsequent housing
workshops. He also organized dozens of
Congress at Your Corner events and
several other events throughout my
district. For his contributions to the
residents of San Joaquin County,
Exodie was featured in San Joaquin
Magazine’s ‘‘5 People Under 30 to
Watch For’’ edition as the Change
Maker.
After working in my Stockton office
for 4 years, Exodie was promoted to
legislative assistant and relocated to
my Washington, D.C. office in 2011.
Exodie was promoted again in 2015 to
senior legislative assistant. During his
time in my office, he worked on several
legislative initiatives and two bills
that were signed into law.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues
to join me in recognizing Exodie C.
Roe, III for his contributions to our
community and for his invaluable pub-
lic service over the past 12 years.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

September 27, 2019
set of regulatory guidance in a timely
manner and a failure of our govern-
ment to adequately prepare the Amer-
ican people for natural disasters and to
provide relief for suffering commu-
nities.
I happen to represent the great State
of Colorado’s Second Congressional
District, and my State is no stranger
to catastrophic weather events. Exac-
erbated by the dangers we face from
the threat of climate change, we regu-
larly experience forest fires, tornadoes,
and other disasters. Six years ago, we
experienced historic flooding most se-
verely impacting Boulder County and
Larimer County, both counties in my
district.
In September of 2013, we were inun-
dated with heavy rainfall with up to 15
inches of rainfall in 1 week in some
areas. The result was devastating
flooding across the front range of Colo-
rado.
b 1200
The storms took the lives of 10 Colo-
radans and caused nearly $4 billion in
damage across 21 counties in our State,
the most expensive disaster in Colo-
rado’s history. Rivers and creeks over-
flowed. Waters seeped into the homes
of thousands and displaced 18,147 people
across our State. Roads and bridges, as
you can see here, were completely
washed out. Much infrastructure was
destroyed.
My district, as I mentioned, contains
two of the counties that were the hard-
est hit by these events, Boulder and
Larimer Counties.
Yet, today, more than 6 years later,
many of these communities have still
not been able to recover from the flood-
ing fully.
Rebuilding from a disaster this se-
vere is a lengthy and expensive process.
However, it is made more difficult by
Federal grant regulations set by the
Federal Emergency Management Agen-
cy, or FEMA, that require cities and
counties to rebuild infrastructure in
the exact same way it had been built
before the disaster in order to qualify
for reimbursement.
If these counties were to rebuild the
roads and bridges that were destroyed
in the flood the same way they were
originally built, it would put these
same communities at risk of future dis-
asters once again.
There is a lack of clarity and consist-
ency for these cities and counties, as
well as countless other cities and coun-
ties across the country, in FEMA’s cur-
rent determination of reimbursements.
Many projects in my district have
been deemed ‘‘not cost-effective’’ be-
cause the counties made an adjustment
and wanted to improve their infra-
structure, not just rebuild the same
road right next to a river that would be
washed out again with the next flood.
Now, the good news is, Madam
Speaker, that Congress has already
acted in a bipartisan way to show that
we understand this problem. Section
1235 of the Disaster Recovery Reform
Act passed last year, in 2018, and it re-
quired that FEMA issue interim guid-
ance, which is based on ‘‘the latest con-
sensus-based codes and standards’’
within 60 days of that law being en-
acted.
Just to give you a sense of context in
terms of time, the law was signed by
the President on October 5, 2018. It has
been almost an entire year since this
bill was signed into law, yet FEMA has
issued no interim guidance.
I understand. I get it. I recognize
that it may take longer than 60 days,
maybe 90 days, maybe 120 days. But an
entire year?
This endangers not just the financial
security of counties in Colorado that
have millions of dollars at risk based
on the pending project determinations,
but it demonstrates a fundamental fail-
ure by the United States Government.
There is simply no excuse for the ex-
tensive delay that FEMA has taken in
issuing this interim guidance.
Millions of dollars are at risk every
day that counties have to wait to learn
if their projects will be reimbursed or
covered under FEMA rulemaking.
I know there are hardworking people
at FEMA who are doing their jobs each
and every day to protect communities
across our country, but I would just
implore the Agency—and we have cer-
tainly communicated this directly to
the Agency—that it should not have
taken 6 years for communities to re-
build their infrastructure after a flood
fully, and it certainly should not be
caused by delays from red tape at the
Federal level.
Promises were made by the Agency
to get this rulemaking done. I urge
FEMA to take action to issue this
guidance in the last few days of Sep-
tember, as they promised.
We have just a few more days,
Madam Speaker, until the month con-
cludes. My constituents are waiting.
The counties are waiting. The country
is waiting. I ask FEMA to not allow for
any other delays, and I yield back the
balance of my time.

RECOGNIZING MOUNT ZION MIS-
SIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH’S
100TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with
great respect and admiration that I take this
time to congratulate Mount Zion Missionary
Baptist Church of Michigan City, Indiana, as
the congregation joins together in celebration
of the church’s 100th anniversary. The parish-
ioners along with Mount Zion’s pastor, Rev-
erend Dr. Stanley Mason and leadership, will
be commemorating this momentous occasion
with a celebratory banquet on Saturday, Sep-
tember 28, 2019.
In 1919, Mount Zion Missionary Baptist
Church was established in Michigan City by
the church’s founding members, Reverend
and Mrs. John McGee, Mr. John Gibbons,
Mother Emma Wilkies, Mother Lola Bolden,
and Sister Willie Lee Thomas. After many
years of holding church services in member’s
homes and store fronts, the congregation and
leadership purchased a church building in
1923. Mount Zion has been through numerous
changes in leadership, membership, and loca-
tion throughout the past century, but the foun-
dation of giving back to the community has
been a steadfast and important mission, and it
continues to this day.
Throughout the years, the members of
Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church have
been dedicated to charitable efforts within the
community of Northwest Indiana and beyond.
Some of the church’s important public service
projects include providing Christmas baskets
for those in need, visitation for the sick, and
Sunday school programs.
Under the leadership of the current pastor,
Reverend Dr. Stanley Mason, new educational
ministries have been established, and charity
work has continued and expanded. In addition,
the church building has undergone numerous
improvements, and the membership has in-
creased. Reverend Mason and the congrega-
tion of Mount Zion have been a true blessing
to the community of Northwest Indiana and
beyond.
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my
other distinguished colleagues join me in hon-
oring and congratulating Mount Zion Mis-
sionary Baptist Church in Michigan City, Indi-
ana, on its 100th anniversary. The members
and church leaders have dedicated them-
selves to serving others, especially to those
most in need, and they are an inspiration to us
all.
HONORING THE CAREER OF JOHN
R. FLINT
HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Madam
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I recog-
nize the distinguished career of John R. Flint,
City Manager of my hometown of Weston,
Florida.
Mr. Flint is one of Broward County’s long-
serving public servants. Appointed as the City
of Weston’s first City Manager in July 1997,
Mr. Flint is the Chief Executive Officer of the
nation’s premier municipal corporation. Incor-
porated in 1996 by an overwhelming percent-
age of its voters, Weston quickly gained inter-
national attention for being one of the coun-
try’s largest master-planned communities and
for the progressive form of contractual munic-
ipal management which Mr. Flint has insti-
tuted. He currently oversees services to the
City’s 67,000 residents, over an area of 27
square miles.
Mr. Flint has served in local government
management capacities in the cities of Holly-
wood and Cooper City where he was respon-
sible for the design, construction and manage-
ment of municipal infrastructure. He has re-
ceived both gubernatorial and legislative ap-
pointments furthering his community service.
John is a consummate professional whom I
am proud to call my friend. I wish him well on
his retirement and thank him for the thoughtful
and committed work he has done to enrich
and safeguard the residents of Weston.
f
FAFSA TRANSLATION ACT
HON. GRACE MENG
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise to bring
attention to the need to have the Free Applica-
tion for Federal Student Aid form available in
multiple foreign languages. Currently, FAFSA
forms are available only in English and Span-
ish.
That is why I am introducing the FAFSA
Translation Act, which would amend the High-
er Education Act of 1965 by requiring the Sec-
retary of Education to translate FAFSA into no
fewer than 11 foreign languages and make
them available in paper and electronic for-
mats.
Madam Speaker, the cost of higher edu-
cation continues to skyrocket, and all students
and families in the United States—regardless
of how proficient they are in English—are enti-
tled to seek the same financial aid they need
to help pay for college. Those who face signifi-
cant language barriers should not be forced to
rely on for-profit companies that charge hun-
dreds of dollars to translate this free applica-
tion. Translating FAFSA into various lan-
guages will help make the financial aid proc-
ess less complicated for many families across
the country. Ultimately, this would allow more
students to access higher education—which is
critical for the economic health of the nation.
I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE CITY OF
ANN ARBOR’S COMMUNITY-LED
SOLAR INSTALLATION PROJECT
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the City of Ann Arbor’s
community-led solar installation project. The
city’s efforts to increase its use of renewable
energy are worthy of commendation.
The Ann Arbor City Council passed the Cli-
mate Action Plan in December of 2012 to help
combat the effects of climate change by re-
ducing the city’s emissions. In the years since,
the city has striven to discover new ways to
implement clean and renewable energy alter-
natives within the city’s daily operations, ex-
ploring possibilities with sun, wind, landfill gas,
and hydro energy sources. Having an average
of 4 to 6 hours of sun exposure every day,
sun in Southeast Michigan can satisfy a sig-
nificant portion of the Ann Arbor community’s
needs. Thus, the city is increasingly investing
in solar energy opportunities and seeking new
ways to incorporate its use.
The City of Ann Arbor’s solar installation
project exemplifies the community’s continued
commitment to climate action, environmental
protection, and public safety. Through the hard
work of dozens of community volunteers from
all walks of life, the project will lead to the in-
stallation of solar panels on the roof of Ann
Arbor Fire Station 6, thereby lowering the sta-
tion’s harmful emissions. The solar installation
project has a real and meaningful impact on
Ann Arbor, as it brings our community to-
gether not only to decrease the city’s carbon
footprint, but to enhance the ability to guard
against future, unpredictable disruptions to the
city’s public safety services like the fire depart-
ment.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring the City of Ann Arbor’s com-
munity-led solar installation project. I am proud
to be part of a community that is so dedicated
to protecting our climate and environment.

CELEBRATING LIUNA LOCAL 500’S
100TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. MARCY KAPTUR
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize a century of service of the Labor-
ers’ Local 500 union in Toledo, Ohio. Next
week members will come together to celebrate
this significant milestone, both reminiscing and
looking toward the future.
The International Hod Carriers’ and Building
Laborers’ Union (which would become today’s
Laborers’ International Union of North Amer-
ica, or LIUNA) Local No. 500 was chartered
on October 20, 1919 to represent laborers
who were in demand to build roads, bridges
and other infrastructure in Toledo and North-
west Ohio. The union has since provided skills
training to thousands of laborers and secured
living wages, health insurance and retirement
pension benefits for thousands of its members
who live and work in Northwest Ohio, allowing
them to live decent, productive lives; provide
for their families; and retire with dignity and
security. Local 500 has produced many com-
munity leaders and has been a beacon in our
community.
Local 500 helped protect its hundreds of
members during the Great Depression of the
1930s while working to build landmark Toledo
structures under the federal New Deal pro-
gram, including University Stadium at the Uni-
versity of Toledo and the Toledo Main Public
Library. Members also contributed mightily on
the home front during World War II, helping to
build many of the Northwest Ohio factories
that supplied and eventually helped win the
war effort.
Over the years, Local 500 members have
helped build many of the vital highways,
roads, bridges and infrastructure of Northwest
Ohio, including the Toledo Municipal Airport,
the Ohio Turnpike, the Davis Besse Nuclear
Power Station, Veterans’ Glass City Skyway,
Interstate 280 and Interstate 475. Members
have helped build and rebuild downtown To-
ledo, including the Fiberglas Tower, Prome-
nade Park, One Seagate Tower, Owens Cor-
ning World Headquarters and the Fifth Third
Field baseball stadium.
At the same time as the members of Local
500 helped to build and shape our region,
they have remained eager and important con-
tributors to our community. The union partici-
pates in charitable initiatives such as repairing
the City of Toledo’s Wilson and Farr pools and
sponsoring the Kings Kids Academy and Fam-
ily House Homeless Shelter.
Today, as Local 500 turns 100 years old, it
continues to serve and protect its membership
and its six-county jurisdiction of Lucas, Wood,
Fulton, Henry, Defiance, and Williams counties
while providing the region with a skilled work-
force involved in the placement and removal
of concrete, demolition, asbestos removal,
grade checking, flagging, carpenters tenders,
brick mason tenders, hazardous waste re-
moval, tunneling and more.
President Barack Obama noted, ‘‘Change
will not come if we wait for some other person
or some other time. We are the ones we’ve
been waiting for. We are the change that we
seek.’’ As the membership of LIUNA Local
500 looks back on a century of progress and
changing both lives and community for the
better, we pause to remember those on whose
shoulders we stand. We look forward to the
next century with promise. Onward.

INTERAGENCY COMMITTEE ON
WOMEN’S BUSINESS ENTERPRISE
ACT OF 2019
HON. GRACE MENG
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise to bring
attention to the critical need to support
women-owned businesses. Women-owned
businesses are driving economic growth in our
nation.
Since 1972, the number of women-owned
businesses increased nearly 3,000 percent.
Between 2018 and 2019, U.S. women of all
backgrounds started an average of 1,817 new
businesses per day, representing 42 percent
of all businesses. These businesses generate
$1.9 trillion and employs 9.4 million workers.
As of 2019, women of color account for 50
percent of all women-owned businesses, and
these businesses in particular are growing at
a significantly faster rate than women in gen-
eral and all businesses. The social and eco-
nomic benefits of encouraging and supporting
women entrepreneurs are undeniable and
enormous.
Despite the incredible ingenuity of women
entrepreneurs, women still face significant bar-
riers to business ownership due to unmanage-
able expectations for work-life balance, implicit
biases against women in STEM, and limited
access to capital.
That is why I am introducing the Interagency
Committee on Women’s Business Enterprise
Act of 2019—a bill to reauthorize a federal
agency (of the same name) that would help
coordinate federal resources and grow
women-owned businesses. Better coordination
is critical to making sure women business
owners and entrepreneurs receive the assist-
ance they need to help start, grow, and sus-
tain their business enterprises. The Inter-
agency Committee’s responsibility will be to
look at the behavior of the federal agencies in
how they support, expand, and strengthen re-
sources and programs for women-owned busi-
nesses—ultimately making sure our federal
government is doing all that it must to support
women entrepreneurs.
First established in 1979, the ICWBE led
several federal agencies in the development of
policies to assist women business owners.
While the Interagency Committee was initially
maintained through both Democratic and Re-
publican administrations, it has been inactive
since 2000 with no chairperson at the helm.
My bill would amend Title IV of the Women’s
Business Ownership Act to reauthorize the
Interagency Committee by making sure a
Chairperson is at the helm. Getting the Inter-
agency Committee back to functioning status
would help increase the ability of the federal
government to provide targeted assistance to
women entrepreneurs so they can achieve
their business goals, while ensuring this entity
carries out its mission to support and reinvigo-
rate women-owned businesses.
Madam Speaker, women entrepreneurs are
the key to engineering new and better innova-
tions in today’s global economy—and I urge
my colleagues to support this legislation.

TAIWAN NATIONAL DAY
HON. JOE WILSON
OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam
Speaker, on October 10, 2019, Taiwan will
celebrate its 108th National Day—also known
as Double Ten Day. I am grateful for the op-
portunity to offer my best wishes to the people
of Taiwan in advance of this occasion.
Taiwan is a friend, an ally, and an important
economic and security partner of the United
States. Trade ties between the U.S. and Tai-
wan have grown rapidly over the years, and
Taiwan is now the United States’ 11th largest
trading partner and South Carolina’s 10th larg-
est trading partner worldwide. We appreciate
the enormous investment of Nan Ya Plastics
Corporation in Lake City as a subsidiary of
Formosa Plastics Group, creating jobs.
The U.S.-Taiwan relations are broader than
just trade. This year marks the 40th anniver-
sary of the Taiwan Relations Act. In the years
since the Act’s adoption, Taiwan has blos-
somed into a thriving full-fledged democracy.
With its respect for the rule of law, human
rights, open market economy and a robust
civil society, Taiwan has served as a beacon
of freedom and an indispensable strategic
partner of the United States in the Indo-Pa-
cific. My lifelong appreciation of the people of
Chinese heritage was inspired by my father,
1st Lt. Hugh deV. Wilson, U.S. Army Air
Corps, 14th Air Force, with the Flying Tigers.
He developed an affection for the people of
China as he served in 1944 in Chengdu,
Xi’an, and Kunming to protect Chinese citizens
from aggressors.

TRIBUTE TO COURTNEY COX COLE
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker,
it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to
honor the life and legacy of Courtney Cox
Cole. An accomplished athlete, Ms. Cole was
known throughout the state of Indiana as both
a successful businesswoman and a dedicated
member of her community. The people of Indi-
ana’s Fifth Congressional District are forever
grateful for her contributions to the City of
Noblesville, the Hamilton County Community,
and the State of Indiana.
Growing up in Hamilton County, Indiana,
Courtney first displayed her immense athletic
talents on both the basketball court and the
golf course. While attending Noblesville High
School, Courtney’s excellence in both sports
helped push her teams to multiple state cham-
pionships. On the golf course, Courtney was
not only a dynamic team leader for the
Noblesville High School Girls Golf team, she
was also an integral part of back to back
championship teams; leading them to the state
championships in both 1987 and 1988. On the
basketball court Courtney amassed a school
record 1,896 points, the 4th highest point total
in women’s high school basketball for the
State of Indiana. With three straight trips to
the state finals from 1987 to 1989 and a state
championship in 1987, Courtney and her fel-
low Noblesville Millers teammates cemented
their place as legends of Hoosier Hysteria.
State and National honors such as being
named a 1989 Indiana All-Star, a USA Today
& Parade Magazine 1st Team All-American,
the Gatorade Player of the Year, and the Dial
Award for National High School Scholar Ath-
lete of the Year solidified Courtney’s place as
an Indiana high school basketball legend. Her
incredible high school academic and athletic
career set a solid example to many young
women for generations. Together, these acco-
lades led to Courtney being added to Seven-
teen Magazine’s list of ‘‘Most Likely to Suc-
ceed’’.
Courtney continued her outstanding aca-
demic and athletic achievement while attend-
ing Indiana University. As a member of the In-
diana’s Women’s Golf team, she twice quali-
fied for the N.C.A.A. Tournament, was a three-
time All-Big Ten and Academic All-Big Ten
performer. Courtney was also honored as a
two-time National Golf Coaches Association
Scholar Athlete. On the Indiana University
basketball court, Courtney was a valued lead-
er on the Indiana Women’s Basketball team,
helping to lead them to a runner-up finish in
the 1991 National Invitational Tournament.
Upon completion of her athletic and academic
careers at Indiana University, Courtney was
honored with Indiana University’s Leanne
Grotke Award for her outstanding contributions
to Women’s Athletics. This is one of the high-
est awards of its kind given by the institution
to trailblazers in women’s athletics.
In addition to her amateur athletic pursuits
after college, Courtney joined the family busi-
ness at Hare Chevrolet in Noblesville, Indiana.
Working for their father Dave Cox, Courtney
and her sister Monica Peck. continued the
family legacy. Courtney and Monica learned
the dedication to customer-service that built
Hare Chevrolet’s footprint in Central Indiana.
In 2008, Courtney and her sister Monica pur-
chased the family business from their parents.
The sisters were sixth-generation owners of
the 172-year-old company which was founded
in 1847 as a buggy and wagon maker busi-
ness. Under their leadership, Hare Chevrolet
quickly became the number one volume Gen-
eral Motors dealership in Indiana. Throughout
the community Courtney and Monica were
well known for their successful business acu-
men, philanthropic and community involve-
ment, and their famous ‘‘Sisters of Savings’’
radio advertisements.
Courtney will be forever missed by her fam-
ily, friends, colleagues, and the entire Indiana
community. On behalf of Indiana’s Fifth Con-
gressional District, I extend my deepest con-
dolences to Courtney’s children Cayla and
Blake Cole, parents Dave and Jackie Cox, her
fiance Tom New, sister Monica Peck and her
family and to Courtney’s entire family and
friends who mourn her loss.

RESOLUTION SUPPORTING THE
GOALS AND IDEALS OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DAY OF NON-VI-
OLENCE
HON. GRACE MENG
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
support the goals and ideals of the Inter-
national Day of Non-Violence by introducing
legislation in the same name. This resolution
calls on Congress to officially recognize Octo-
ber 2nd as the International Day of Non-Vio-
lence in the United States and encourages
Americans to observe this day with appro-
priate ceremonies, programs, and activities.
Mohandas ‘‘Mahatma’’ Gandhi once said, ‘‘I
object to violence because when it appears to
do good, the good is only temporary; the evil
it does is permanent.’’ This pioneer of non-vio-
lence political protest fought for India’s inde-
pendence from colonial rule through edu-
cation, tolerance, and other means. He be-
lieved that one must use peace, respect, and
community activism in order to create social
change. Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophies in-
spired Martin Luther King, Jr. and led the
United Nations General Assembly to choose
his birthday, October 2nd, as the International
Day of Non-Violence.
I urge my colleagues to join me in com-
memorating Gandhi’s birthday by celebrating
and redoubling our efforts to strive for non-vio-
lent solutions to address the world’s injustices.

HONORING SPECIALIST FOURTH
CLASS JOHN WESLEY DAHR
HON. SCOTT PERRY
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I rise today
on behalf of the Tenth District of Pennsylvania
and a grateful Nation to honor the memory of
Specialist Fourth Class John Wesley Dahr of
Dillsburgh, Pennsylvania who earned the Dis-
tinguished Service Cross for his exceptional
bravery in combat during the Vietnam War.
Specialist Dahr made the ultimate sacrifice for
the United States of America and for his fellow
soldiers.
On January 8, 1967, Specialist Dahr was
participating in search and destroy missions
near Cu Chi with elements of the 25th Infantry
Division when his company was pinned down
by Viet Cong and received heavy incoming
fire. He willingly exposed himself to enemy fire
and waded through waist-deep water to aid a
wounded comrade. After carrying that soldier
one hundred meters to safety, he repeated his
heroic actions, rescuing two more soldiers be-
fore returning to the center of the battlefield to
combat the enemy.
As he fired upon the Viet Cong, he saw an-
other wounded soldier and ran to his aid. De-
spite extreme risk to his own life, he stood up
in the open to hold the injured man above
water while he sought assistance to carry him
to safety. Dahr was mortally wounded during
his attempt to rescue a fourth soldier.
Specialist Dahr has America’s undying grati-
tude for his extraordinary heroism. His cour-
age and sacrifice demonstrate the best of our
military’s tradition of service to our Nation.

Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Captain Vincent Tiseo, a
resident of my hometown of Naperville, Illinois,
on his retirement from the United States Navy
and for a lifetime of service to our nation.
Upon receiving his ROTC commission from
the University of Michigan in 1988, Captain
Tiseo served as a surface warfare officer and
completed tours aboard USS Meyerkord,
where he earned his Surface Warfare Officer
designation, and at Fleet Deception Group At-
lantic in Norfolk, VA. He transitioned from ac-
tive duty in 1993, but his service did not end.
Capt. Tiseo remained in the U.S. Navy Re-

NOTCH FAIRNESS ACT
HON. GRACE MENG
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
bring attention to the need to right a wrong
caused by Congress in 1972 when Congress
amended the Social Security Act to adjust the
benefits formula to include automatic cost-of-
living adjustments. Unfortunately, this new for-
mula was flawed; it resulted in unexpected
windfalls for beneficiaries born before 1917.
In 1977, Congress corrected the formula,
but beneficiaries born between 1917 and 1926
received significantly less than those born be-
fore and after them. Those born during these
nine years are referred to as ‘‘Notch Babies,’’
and Congress has been attempting to offset
this disparity since 1999.
That is why I am introducing the Notch Fair-
ness Act, which would compensate Notch Ba-
bies by providing them with either a one-time
benefit of $5,000 payable over a period of four
years, or monthly benefits in accordance with
a new formula.
Madam Speaker, fixing this disparity in ben-
efits would not only make a real difference to
our seniors who rely on this money as their
main source of income, but it is the fair thing
to do for seniors who were shortchanged by
Congress. I urge my colleagues to support this
legislation.

HONORING DAVID DEMANT
HON. JARED HUFFMAN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of David Demant, who
has the honor of being named Humboldt
County Citizen of the Year for 2019. Mr.
Demant’s contributions to the local community
are exemplary.
Mr. Demant has been engaged in civic
issues since childhood. He joined the newly
formed Environmental Club at his middle
school in 1969, and wrote his first opinion let-
ter to his Congressman in 7th grade. His activ-
ism grew into adulthood when he joined the
Friends of the Eel River and became an active
union member.
Mr. Demant has a Bachelor of Arts degree
in Music Education and a teaching credential
from Humboldt State University. He was
named Outstanding Music Educator of the
Year in 2005 from the California Music Educa-
tor Association, North Coast Section, and he
has taught music to North Coast residents
ranging from preschool to community college.
He has spent over three decades working and
educating students in both public and private
schools. He served as president of the Eureka
Teachers Association, and he played a pivotal
role in the annual Labor Day Picnic over many
years. Mr. Demant is active in community or-
ganizations including the Humboldt and Del
Norte County Central Labor Council, organizes
local marches, and still finds time to sing to
Humboldt County residents in care homes
each week.
Mr. Demant has dedicated his life to public
service and community improvement. Madam
Speaker, please join me in expressing deep
appreciation for David Demant’s commitment
to bettering his community and congratulating
him on his service to the North Coast.

IN HONOR OF BRUCE
SPRINGSTEEN’S 70TH BIRTHDAY
HON. MIKIE SHERRILL
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Bruce Springsteen, the New
Jersey legend who turned 70 years old this
week.
There is so much this Jersey Girl could say
to honor Bruce Springsteen on his birthday. I
could remind you of his 19+ albums, 15 world
tours, sold-out Broadway shows, best-selling
autobiography, countless Grammys, an Oscar,
Kennedy Center Honors, Presidential Medal of
Freedom, and membership in the New Jersey
Hall of Fame. I could recount his lyrics that
are poetic stories of everyday people just try-
ing to get by.
I could tell you of his epic concerts and the
way he connects with each audience member
in sold-out stadiums and how he makes them
feel as though he’s singing directly to them. If
you’re lucky enough to experience it as I have,
a live Springsteen show is not something you
watch, but nearly 4 hours of power, raw beau-
ty, and sweat that you actively participate in.
Or maybe, to best honor him for his 70th
birthday, I should proudly say that Bruce
Springsteen is the unofficial spokesperson and
ambassador of our great state.
He sings for the underdog, for the quiet
hero, and for every New Jerseyan who has
dared to dream of a better life for themselves.
He sings about what is possible when we truly
connect with each other and work to better the
lives of our neighbors.
Bruce represents not only the best of New
Jersey, but the best of America. He reminds
us that this great nation of ours is indeed The
Promised Land, and that each of us has a re-
sponsibility to make it so.
Happy Birthday, Bruce.

DOUGLAS IRBY EARNS RANK OF
EAGLE SCOUT
HON. PETE OLSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to congratulate Douglas Irby of Pearland,
Texas for earning the rank of Eagle Scout.
Eagle Scout is the highest honor a Boy Scout
can achieve.
Only a small percentage of Boy Scouts
reach the rank of Eagle Scout. This honor re-
quires years of effort to develop the necessary
leadership, service and outdoor skills. To earn
it, Douglas planned, built and organized a li-
brary for First Nation students of Ojibway Her-
itage School near Winnipeg, Canada. Douglas
became aware of the need for a library and
reading facility during his canoe trip with Troop
55 during the summer of 2016. Douglas tack-
led this project with passion and determina-
tion, and provided a library for the students of
Ojibway Heritage School. This dedication has
prepared him to be a leader in his future ca-
reer. The leadership skills he learned through
Boy Scouts are already benefiting commu-
nities across the world, just as the contribu-
tions of Boy Scouts continue to benefit our
local communities in countless ways.
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-
sional District of Texas, congratulations again
to Douglas Irby for becoming an Eagle Scout.
We are proud of his continued success and
thank him for his dedication to making our
community a better place.

RESPONSIBLE BODY ARMOR
POSSESSION ACT
HON. GRACE MENG
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, gun violence
continues to plague our streets and our com-
munities. Even more frightening and dan-
gerous is a gunman who is protected by en-
hanced body armor.
Madam Speaker, every second a shooter is
on their feet, more lives are threatened.
Gun violence researchers and the law en-
forcement community agree that the armored
gunman is threatening the safety of our com-
munity. Enhanced body armor, which is de-
signed for military use, is increasingly being
used in the commission of violence crimes in
our streets, and to overcome law enforcement
response.
We have seen shootings by gunmen wear-
ing body armor in Riverside, CA, Salt Lake
City, UT, Pittsburgh, PA, Cleveland, OH, Bing-
hamton, NY, and many other communities. In
2012, the gunman in the Aurora, CO movie
theatre shooting wore a ballistic helmet, bal-
listic leggings, a throat protector, a groin pro-
tector, and tactical gloves. It has also been re-
ported the gunman in Dayton was wearing
body armor. Body armor was also found in the
home of the Gilroy Garlic Festival’s gunman,
and the Pulse night club shooter in Orlando,
FL, attempted to buy body armor to protect
himself during the massacre. One can deduce
that had the Gilroy and Orlando shooters been
wearing military-grade body armor, the num-
ber of casualties would have been far greater.
Shockingly, there are no federal restrictions
on civilians’ access to this type of military
body armor.
That is why I am introducing the Respon-
sible Body Armor Possession Act which would
keep military body armor out of the hands of
mass shooters by prohibiting the sale, trans-
fer, or possession of enhanced body armor by

civilians. The bill includes exemptions for law
enforcement, active duty military, and other
public servants whose job responsibilities re-
quire them to possess body armor. Ultimately,
my legislation will ensure a comprehensive ap-
proach to ensuring public safety.
Madam Speaker, there is nothing more dan-
gerous than a well-armored, unstoppable ac-
tive shooter. Armor designed for warfare has
no place in our communities and on our
streets. I urge my colleagues to support this
critical legislation.

CELEBRATING THE 50TH
ANNIVERSARY OF EL CHICANO
HON. PETE AGUILAR
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize El Chicano, an Inland Empire in-
stitution that has given a voice to Latinos in
my community for 50 years. Owned and oper-
ated by Gloria and Bill Harrison, this publica-
tion highlights the important role Latinos have
played in shaping the history and culture of
the Inland Empire and continues to recognize
the accomplishments and contributions of the
Hispanic-American community in Southern
California.
From lack of representation in public office
to limited educational opportunities, El Chi-
cano set out to address the inequities felt by
Mexican-Americans in our community. Found-
ed by young activists who sought to highlight
their own experiences and perspectives as
Latinos, the publication began to run inde-
pendently in 1969, and has celebrated the
unique culture and accomplishments of the
Southern California Latino community ever
since. Over the years, El Chicano has stayed
true to its original mission; to give a voice in
media to those who needed to be heard.
This Hispanic Heritage month, it is my privi-
lege to recognize 50 years of El Chicano,
which plays such a crucial role in the media
landscape of the Inland Empire. I want to
thank Gloria and Bill Harrison for their unwav-
ering commitment to this publication and to
our community, and I look forward to cele-
brating another 50 years of El Chicano.

INTRODUCTION OF THE SAFE AND
QUIET SKIES ACT
HON. ED CASE
OF HAWAII
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, today I have
introduced H.R. 4547, the Safe and Quiet
Skies Act, to ensure that commercial air tour
flights are adequately regulated to ensure
safety and address current widespread com-
munity disruption. I extend a special thanks to
my colleague, Congressman Brad Sherman of
California, for cointroducing this necessary
measure.
The national problem of inadequately regu-
lated commercial air tour flights has been
highlighted in my own state of Hawai’i in just
the last few months. We have seen three
dead in the crash of a commercial air tour hel-
icopter into a residential neighborhood and
eleven more dead in the crash of a commer-
cial skydiving plane.
These tragedies occurred amidst a rapid in-
crease in commercial helicopter and small
plane overflights of all parts of my state includ-
ing residential, commercial and industrial
neighborhoods, cemeteries and memorials,
land and marine parks and other recreation
areas, and sensitive military installations.
These have disrupted whole communities with
excessive noise and other impacts, destroyed
the peace and sanctity of special places, in-
creased risk to not only passengers but those
on the ground, and weakened security and
management of defense operations.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
currently has virtually exclusive jurisdiction
over these aircraft operations. Following both
of these recent tragedies, the National Trans-
portation Safety Board (NTSB), which is re-
sponsible for investigating accidents but not
for direct safety regulation, strongly rec-
ommended to the FAA that safety-related reg-
ulation of commercial tour helicopters and
small aircraft skydiving operations is generally
insufficient.
Regarding ground disruption and risk, the
FAA takes the position that its responsibility is
strictly operational safety and national air-
space efficiency and does not extend to
ground disruption and other negative impacts.
As a result, the operators, aside from strict
takeoff and approach, avoidance of estab-
lished flight paths and other limited cir-
cumstances, are virtually free to fly wherever,
whenever and as often as they want. And they
do, with little to no self-regulation.
This situation is unacceptable for both safe-
ty and community impact concerns. It is also
not limited to Hawai’i, with growing concerns
in other areas with high commercial tour
usage, more dense populations, valuable nat-
ural resources, significant defense installations
and other factors.
This bill would first require the FAA to imple-
ment the NTSB’s recommended enhanced
safety regulations. It would also prohibit flights
over federal property that requires privacy,
dignity and respect, to include military installa-
tions, national cemeteries and national parks,
wildlife refuges and wilderness. It would fur-
ther require the use of standard equipment to
monitor the location of flights, apply the ‘‘ster-
ile cockpit rule’’ to tour flights (meaning in part
that the pilot could not also be the tour guide),
prohibit flights lower than 1,500 feet over ac-
tual ground, and limit decibel levels to those
commonly applied to operations in residential
areas. Additionally, the bill would allow states,
localities, and tribes to impose stricter regula-
tions on tour flights in their jurisdictions with
required public engagement.
I look forward to working with my colleagues
to pass this bill into law.

LTG LaCamera received a Bachelor of
Science from the U.S. Military Academy and a
Master of Arts degree from the U.S. Naval
War College. After graduating from West Point
in 1985, he was commissioned as an Infantry
Officer and has proven time and again to be
a natural leader with an incredible drive and
work ethic. His past assignments include serv-
ice with the 82d Airborne Division, Fort Bragg,
North Carolina; 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger
Regiment, Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia; 4th
Ranger Training Battalion and the 75th Rang-
er Regiment, Fort Benning, Georgia; 2d Infan-
try Division, Eighth United States Army, Re-
public of Korea; 10th Mountain Division

vision, Schofield Barracks, Hawaii; U.S. Army
Special Operations Command, Fort Bragg,
North Carolina; 4th Infantry Division, Fort Car-
son, Colorado; and the Office of Security Co-
operation, Baghdad, Iraq.
I know I speak for everyone in the Fort
Bragg community when I say he will be
missed but is well deserving of this promotion.
I wish him, his wife Theresa, and their four
children the best of luck as they embark on
this new adventure in service to our nation.

honoring LTG Paul LaCamera and his nomi-
nation for promotion and selection of General

HONORING MARY E. PERRY
HON. DAVID E. PRICE
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mary E.
Perry, a long-time community leader and ad-
vocate in Wake County, North Carolina, who
is celebrating her 90th birthday on October 15,
2019.
Mrs. Perry has served as President of the
Wendell-Wake County Branch of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP) for 41 years, amplifying the
voices of underrepresented community mem-
bers. She also was elected the first African
American to chair the Wake County Demo-
cratic Party and served for 20 years on the
East Wake Advisory Council.
Mrs. Perry’s service is marked by a resolve
to fight injustice—from the early days of the
civil rights movement to the present fight for
voting rights and equity in education, health
care, and housing. In Jim Crow North Caro-
lina, she endured threats as she challenged
the practice of segregation at restaurants in
Zebulon. This difficult and formative experi-
ence strengthened her determination to speak
out and stand up for underrepresented com-
munities. More recently, she served as a
plaintiff in a NAACP lawsuit against North
Carolina’s discriminatory voter ID laws. Mrs.
Perry also helped empower the next genera-
tion of youth leaders to follow in her footsteps
by reactivating the Wendell-Wake County
NAACP youth council.
Her dedication earned her numerous acco-
lades. The NAACP recognized her as the
President of the Year in addition to granting
her the Charles McLean Award and the Polit-
ical Action Trailblazer Award. She received the
Order of the Long Leaf Pine from then-North
Carolina Governor James B. Hunt and the
Zeta Sigma Chapter of the Phi Beta Sigma
Fraternity Social Act Award. Additionally, she
is widely recognized for her devotion to com-
munity service, receiving the North Carolina

In her hometown, Mrs. Perry has attended
and offered leadership at the Pleasant Grove

me in recognizing Mrs. Mary E. Perry for her
long and fruitful life of service and in sending
her best-wishes for her 90th birthday.
REAFFIRMING IMPORTANCE OF
THE UNITED STATES TO PRO-
MOTE THE SAFETY, HEALTH,
AND WELL-BEING OF REFUGEES
AND DISPLACED PERSONS
SPEECH OF
HON. TED LIEU
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, September 24, 2019
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I
am glad that the House is considering H. Res.
444, a bipartisan resolution that I introduced
with Representatives DIAZ-BALART, NEGUSE,
and LOFGREN to reaffirm U.S. leadership in re-
sponding to displacement crises around the
world.
We are facing the worst refugee crisis in
history. According to the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, in 2018, there
were more than 70.8 million displaced persons
worldwide. This included nearly 26 million ref-
ugees, over 41 million internally displaced per-
sons, and 3.5 million people seeking asylum.
Put another way, in 2018, 37,000 people were
being displaced from their homes each day.
About half of all refugees were children. 67
percent came from Syria, Afghanistan, South
Sudan, Myanmar, and Somalia and 84 percent
were hosted by developing nations.
Beyond the statistics, there are far too many
stories of people fleeing despair. Seemingly
every day we are presented with new ac-
counts of migrants in Central America escap-
ing gang or domestic violence and seeking
refuge in the United States. Across the globe,
Syrians, Somalians, Yemenis, and others con-
tinue to be displaced by various conflicts.
This refugee crisis requires global leader-
ship and compassion—yet we have seen the
Trump Administration drastically reduce ref-
ugee admissions into the U.S. In 2018, the
United States resettled only 22,000 refugees
compared to the 85,000 resettled in 2016.
Now, we’re hearing reports that the Adminis-
tration is considering lowering the refugee ad-
missions ceiling for next year to as low as
zero to 10,000 people. And while the new fis-
cal year begins in one week, the Administra-
tion still hasn’t consulted with Congress—as
it’s required to do by law—about its plans.
This is a betrayal of our shared American
values. And it’s a betrayal of our fellow human
beings. Refugees are fleeing their homes be-
cause they are being persecuted for their
race, religion, nationality, for belonging to a
particular social group or being of a certain
political opinion. They need our assistance.
The United States resettlement program is
critical to global humanitarian efforts. These
efforts serve to strengthen global security, ad-
vance United States foreign policy goals, and
support regional host countries while also
serving individuals and families in need. More-
over, the resettlement program benefits the in-
terests of the United States.
When I was in the Air Force I saw the need
for and the significance of our refugee reset-
tlement program first-hand. In the 1990s, I
participated in Operation Pacific Haven, where
the United States helped thousands of Kurds
flee from northern Iraq to prevent Saddam
Hussein from slaughtering them. We first
brought them to Guam, where I saw the ex-
tensive screening process that the U.S. con-
ducted before bringing many of the refugees
to the mainland. Not only were lives saved in
this operation, but decades later our nation
continues to benefit from helping those refu-
gees. Knowing the severity of the refugee cri-
sis today, we as a nation must do better to
help those in need.
My resolution reaffirms the United States
commitment to promote the safety, health, and
well-being of the millions of displaced persons.
It recognizes the people and organizations
who have risked their lives to provide assist-
ance to displaced communities. Moreover, the
resolution calls on the Secretary of State and
the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations to
continue supporting robust funding for refugee
protection and humanitarian response over-
seas and resettlement to the United States; to
set robust refugee admissions goals; and to
work in partnership with the international com-
munity to find solutions to existing conflicts
and to promote peace and reconciliation.
I am grateful that it is supported by more
than 60 organizations including Church World
Service, International Rescue Committee,
Oxfam America, and Refugees International,
and has been cosponsored by 74 of our col-
leagues in the House. I also thank my col-
leagues, Representatives MARIO DIAZ-BALART,
ZOE LOFGREN, and JOE NEGUSE, for their part-
nership on this bipartisan legislation.
The United States was built on the idea that
we could create a free country that would
serve as a haven for those fleeing persecu-
tion. Refugees don’t make our country less
safe. But, xenophobia, fear and hate do.
Today, by passing this bipartisan resolution,
Congress will send a clear message that
America is stronger when we welcome refu-
gees and help those in need.
I urge my colleagues to support this resolu-
tion.

DOUBLE TEN DAY
HON. CHARLES J. ‘‘CHUCK’’
FLEISCHMANN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Madam Speaker, Octo-
ber 10 is the national day of Taiwan. I would
like to take this opportunity to wish the people
of Taiwan a very Happy Double Ten Day.
Despite its small size, Taiwan is the 11th
largest trading partner for the United States
overall. The United States is Taiwan’s 2rd
largest trading partner and a leading destina-
tion for Taiwan’s overseas investors. These
figures represent a strong foundation that has
been built between the two industries.
Our close ties are not just for trade and
economy. Over the years, Taiwan has proven
itself to be a model democracy in the Indo-Pa-
cific. Its embrace of democracy shows a better
path for it’s people and their future. Wash-
ington and Taipei share the same values of
democracy, freedom, and rule of laws. The
Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) was enshrined in
1979, and later supplemented by the Six As-
surances given by President Ronald Reagan
in 1982. The TRA and the Six Assurances
both formed the cornerstone of our relations
with Taiwan. Together we have faced many
challenges while displaying a steadfast com-
mitment to one another’s security and pros-
perity.

HONORING LLOYD WRIGHT
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor Mr. Lloyd Wright, the
President and CEO of WFYI in Indianapolis,
Indiana, on his retirement. For the last three
decades, Lloyd has led WFYI to become one
of the premier radio stations in the State of In-
diana. Under the stewardship of Lloyd, WFYI
made unprecedented strides forward in the
quality of programming and the number of
daily listeners.
Lloyd, a native of Beech Grove, Indiana who
upon graduation from Indiana University
began his nearly four decade long career in
public broadcasting. He began with a position
as Director of Instructional Broadcasting with
the Indiana Department of Education. Later
Lloyd served for six years as Broadcast Oper-
ations Manager at WTTW (Chicago Public Tel-
evision), and then moved on to become a Pro-
ducer, Director, and Writer for the Indiana Uni-
versity News Bureau. Lloyd joined WFYI in
1988 as Director of Program Production. The
following year, Lloyd was appointed WFYI’s
President and Chief Executive Officer, a posi-
tion he has held for a remarkable 30 years.
Under Lloyd’s leadership, WFYI’s annual oper-
ating budget grew from $2.5 million in 1988 to
more than $11 million today.
In his time at the helm of WFYI Public
Media, the group flourished as a multi-media
content provider, with its three distinct public
television services, two HD public radio chan-
nels, interactive website and a growing array
of social media assets. Program lineup
changes made to satisfy audience demand for
National Public Radio programs such as
‘‘Morning Edition’’ and ‘‘All Things Considered’’
helped to increase the footprint of WFYI
throughout Central Indiana. Nationally loved
children’s television programs such as ‘‘Ses-
ame Street’’ and ‘‘Mr. Roger’s Neighborhood’’
help to anchor a strong daily program lineup
that built large audiences. Lloyd’s leadership
also saw the creation of Indiana-related con-
tent and shows such as ‘‘Indiana Week in Re-
view’’ and ‘‘Across Indiana’’. These steps for-
ward in programming led to a 450 percent in-
crease to the station’s operating budget and a
station membership of 25,000 listeners.
In 2008, under the stewardship of Lloyd,
WFYI successfully completed a $20 million
capital campaign, and was awarded a
$900,000 Kresge Foundation Capital Grant.
As a result of this massively successful fund-
raising campaign, WFYI was honored with
multiple PBS Development Awards, including
the ‘‘Award of Excellence for Overall Member-
ship’’. Lloyd himself was recognized with
Emmy Awards for Technical Achievement and
Station of Excellence, as well as two Saga-
more of the Wabash honors, the highest
award given by Indiana Governors to recog-
nize distinguished service to the State of Indi-
ana. The station also earned distinctions from
the National Academy of Television Arts and
Sciences, Society of Professional Journalists,
the Public Media Journalists Association, As-
sociated Press and the Indiana Broadcasters
Association during Lloyd’s time at the helm. In
October of 2013, Lloyd received the distin-
guished honor of being inducted into the Indi-
ana Broadcasters Association Pioneers Hall of
Fame.
In addition to his work with WFYI, Lloyd
served multiple terms on the PBS Board of Di-
rectors, including the PBS Executive Com-
mittee, lending his expertise to those also in
the public broadcasting arena. Lloyd has also
generously given back to the City of Indianap-
olis, participating in many community organi-
zations. Lloyd serves on the boards of the
Greater Indianapolis Progress Committee, The
Economic Club of Indiana, among others. Ad-
ditionally, Lloyd also serves as a member
ofthe Board of Trustees for Central Christian
Church in downtown Indianapolis.
The positive impact of Lloyd’s work with
WFYI has benefited generations of Hoosiers.
His dedication to public service and public
broadcasting have been invaluable to the citi-
zens of Central Indiana and the country. On
behalf of all Hoosiers I would like to thank
Lloyd for his decades of service to public
media consumers throughout Central Indiana,
and wish him and his family all the best in a
well-deserved retirement.

HONORING MARY ANN LEVAR ON
HER RETIREMENT
HON. MIKE QUIGLEY
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Mary Ann Levar and express my con-
gratulations on her retirement from the U.S.
House of Representatives. Since my election
to Congress ten years ago, Mary Ann has
been indispensable to my congressional office,
serving as my District Director and assisting
thousands of my constituents in Chicago and
in the Chicagoland area.
It would be impossible to properly thank or
congratulate Mary Ann without making clear
the indelible mark she has left on my district.
Mary Ann was not just my District Director—
she was truly the Fifth District of Illinois’ Dis-
trict Director. What began with a role serving
as a receptionist and staff assistant for Con-
gressman Dan Rostenkowski in 1994 evolved
into years of working as a caseworker for
Congressman Rod Blagojevich and culminated
in her promotion to District Director for Con-
gressman Rahm Emanuel and for myself.
After a decade of working together, I have
seen firsthand what I’ve heard time and again
from my constituents: that Mary Ann Levar is
a tireless advocate for them and for the peo-
ple of Chicago, leading my District Office with
a compassionate, steady hand.
As a lifelong Chicagoan, Mary Ann put her
heart and soul into her service to the people
of Illinois’ Fifth District. The daughter of Ger-
man immigrants, Mary Ann spent her career
working to improve her city. She raised her
four children—Julie, Ryan, Michelle, and Pat
Jr.—in Chicago with her husband of over forty
years, former Alderman Pat Levar. She is now
a proud grandmother to four, with a fifth
grandchild on the way. I have no doubt that
she is excited to spend more of her time with
those beautiful grandchildren.
Madam Speaker, the Fifth District will simply
not be the same without Mary Ann’s leader-
ship. Her contributions will be felt for years to
come and her legacy will live on in the work
of all the staff she trained over the years. I ask
my colleagues to join me in thanking Mary
Ann Levar for her tremendous public service.

HONORING CMSGT DARYL COOK
ON HIS 32 YEARS OF MILITARY
SERVICE
HON. RICHARD HUDSON
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Chief Master Sergeant Daryl Cook on
his 32 years of military service.
Over the years, CMSgt Cook has made im-
measurable contributions to our great nation
and continues to personify the core North
Carolina National Guard values of integrity,
selfless service, and honor. He started his ca-
reer in 1987 as a Fire Protection Specialist
with the U.S. Air Force and retires as the In-
stallation Fire Chief, 145th Airlift Wing, North
Carolina National Guard located at Charlotte
Douglas International Airport.
During his career, CMSgt Cook has served
as Airport Fire Fighter, Driver/Engineer, Fire
Inspector, Hazardous Material Technician, and
Nuclear Biological Chemical (NBC) Federal
Trainer. Immediately following the September
11th terrorist attacks that devastated our na-
tion, CMSgt was requested through the Army
National Guard Readiness Center to staff the
Civil Support Team Cell. Exemplary of CMSgt
Cook’s devotion to service, he helped manage
response and readiness in support of Oper-
ation Noble Eagle. Cook has served as DOD
HazMat Trainer, an instructor for the On-
Scene Commanders Course and through the
Department of Defense instructs first respond-
ers in NBC type events. CMSgt Cook has
been instrumental in the development of the
NC Emergency Training Center project at the
Stanly County Airport.
I am proud to represent a district with one
of the largest military and veteran populations,
and I know I speak for our entire community
when I say we are truly grateful for CMSgt
Cook’s extraordinary service and cannot thank
him enough. I would like to offer my sincerest
appreciation and wish him success in his fu-
ture endeavors.
Madam Speaker, please join me today in
honoring Chief Master Sergeant Daryl Cook
on his 32 years of military service.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF
ANTOINE RIPOLL AS DIRECTOR
OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
LIAISON OFFICE
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the service of Mr. Antoine Ripoll, the
outgoing Director of the European Parliament
Liaison Office.
Antoine Ripoll has dedicated his career to
the European Union and transatlantic rela-
tions. After completing his Master in Public
and European Law at Paris-Panthéon
Sorbonne University, he first worked as a civil
servant at the European Commission.
In 1988, Antoine Ripoll joined the European
Parliament, where he went on to hold a num-
ber of roles ranging from communication to
positions with parliamentary committees.
When the European Union began exploring
the prospect of enlargement into the former
Eastern Bloc, he worked to lay the ground-
work for this remarkable achievement.
Antoine Ripoll’s accomplishments do not
end there. From 2007 to 2012, he served as
the Chief of Staff of the European People’s
Party, which was the largest group in the EU
Parliament at the time. In 2012, he
transitioned to serving as Director for Rela-
tions with Parliamentary Groups in the Gen-
eral Secretariat of the European Parliament
and, later that year, moved to Washington,
D.C. to become Director of the European Par-
liament Liaison Office.
In his current role, Antoine Ripoll has facili-
tated discussions between Members of both
Houses of Congress, from both sides of the
aisle, with their European counterparts to pro-
ductively address matters of critical impor-
tance on both sides of the Atlantic.
His commitment to transatlantic under-
standing and cooperation has positively im-
pacted the E.U.-U.S. relationship in a wide
range of areas. For his many services and
contributions, he has been honored with the
Chevalier de l’ordre national du Mérite by his
native France.
Over the past several years, the U.S. lead-
ership of the Transatlantic Legislators’ Dia-
logue has worked closely with Antoine Ripoll.
Members of Congress have spent many hours
discussing European-American relations and
have benefited immensely from his experience
and expertise.
With the transatlantic relationship more im-
portant today than perhaps any other time in
our shared history, it is critical to recognize the
achievements of those who have worked to
build and maintain the peace and prosperity
we currently enjoy on both sides of the Atlan-
tic.
Antoine Ripoll’s commitment to helping
American and European legislators work to-
gether, and his overall contributions to the
transatlantic relationship, should serve as an
inspiration to us all.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in recognizing the service of Mr.
Antoine Ripoll and wishing him the best in his
future endeavors.

HONORING DAPHNE AND BOB
PHILIPSON
HON. NITA M. LOWEY
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor the accomplishments and contributions
of Daphne and Bob Philipson, recipients of the
2019 Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic
(PPHP) Legacy Award, in recognition of their
substantial years of community involvement
and active volunteerism.
Daphne Philipson, CPA, has served multiple
stints on the PPHP board, first from 1999
through 2006, then from 2008 through 2012.
She has also served on PPHP Executive,
Board Development and Nominating, Budget
and Finance, and Fundraising Committees.
She was a partner at E.M. Warburg, Pincus &
Co., where she headed investor relations. She
is a graduate of Columbia University’s Busi-
ness School and Barnard College, where she
currently serves on the board of trustees.
As a teenager, Bob Philipson developed a
passion for ensuring access to family planning
through reading about Marie Stopes and was
a strong supporter of the legalization of abor-
tion in the United Kingdom. He went on to
graduate with a degree in Politics and Eco-
nomics at Durham University’s Hatfield Col-
lege and subsequently held positions in a
number of companies in the UK, Belgium,
Sweden and the U.S. He became a U.S. cit-
izen in 1998 and became active in Democratic
politics, serving as Treasurer and Chairman of
the Irvington Democrats. He spent many years
escorting at clinics that provided abortion serv-
ices and demonstrating and lobbying in sup-
port of Planned Parenthood. He continues his
activism to this day.
The advocacy and commitment of commu-
nity members like Daphne and Bob Philipson
is a crucial element of the fight to ensure that
every woman, and man, in America has ac-
cess to the reproductive and preventative
health care they need. I’m proud to be a part-
ner with the Philipsons and Planned Parent-
hood Hudson Peconic in this effort, and I
thank them for their diligent work.
Madam Speaker, l urge my fellow Members
of Congress to join me in recognizing Mr. and
Mrs. Philipson for their many years of service
to the community.
VETERAN OF THE MONTH
WILLIAM CALDWELL
HON. KEVIN HERN
OF OKLAHOMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Madam
Speaker, I rise to honor the First District of
Oklahoma’s September Veteran of the Month,
Lieutenant William Caldwell.
A B–17 Pilot in the United States Air Force,
Lieutenant Caldwell honorably served our na-
tion during World War II. A member of the
Greatest Generation, Mr. Caldwell began his
military service in 1936 at the age of 14 when
he joined the National Guard. When the
United States entered World War II, William
and his four brothers, Wayne, George, James,
and Floyd, like so many others, courageously
answered their nation’s call. All five Caldwell
brothers served abroad and returned safely
home to Oklahoma.
As our nation has recently paused to re-
member our POWs and MIAs through POW/
MIA Recognition Day, it is important that we
honor veterans like Lieutenant Caldwell who
continued to honorably serve their country
while being held captive by enemy forces. On
his 22nd and final bombing mission, Lieuten-
ant Caldwell and his crew were shot down
over Germany. They were taken captive by
German forces and held in prison camps until
they were liberated in 1945.
Lieutenant Caldwell has lived a life of un-
matched dedication, sacrifice, and service to
our great nation. He answered the call to de-
fend freedom across the globe and sacrificed
whatever was necessary in the name of that
noble cause. It is my honor to recognize Lieu-
tenant William Caldwell as the 1st Congres-
sional District of Oklahoma’s September Vet-
eran of the Month.

Arbor center.
In 1991, Ele’s Place was founded in the
basement of a church by a group of grieving
parents, healthcare professionals, and other
volunteers to support children experiencing the
death of a loved one. Realizing children and
teenagers process grief in entirely different
ways than adults, the organization knew it
needed to find a way to properly help youth
cope with their feelings of sadness, anger, and
loss. Through a great deal of research, the or-
ganization determined that peer support pro-
grams offered the best way for children to
work through their grief and began extending
these services to children and their families
multiple times a week.
Since its humble beginnings, Ele’s Place
has significantly expanded. With the addition
of its new Ann Arbor space, Ele’s Place today

ment, Ele’s Place still works tirelessly to find
new ways to support children experiencing
loss and is fully dedicated to reaching its mis-
sion of ensuring no child in Michigan ever has
to grieve alone. The efforts of Ele’s Place are
critical and have a real impact on our commu-
nity, as its services help hundreds of children
and teens each week.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring Ele’s Place for its commitment
to grieving children throughout Michigan and
congratulate the organization on the opening
of its new home in Ann Arbor. We are grateful
for its impact on the children of our community
and wish it continued success ahead.

RECOGNIZING INDIANA
UNIVERSITY
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor my alma mater, Indiana
University, as we recognize and celebrate the
Bicentennial Anniversary of this hallowed insti-
tution. As a beacon of world-class academic
excellence, Indiana University has given the
world a multitude of dynamic and impactful
leaders in a vast array of disciplines. Both the
United States and the international community
have benefited from the influence of the le-
gions of Indiana University alumni spanning
the globe.
Shortly after gaining statehood, the Indiana
General Assembly passed legislation man-
dating the creation of a state seminary institu-
tion in 1820. By 1822 construction on the ear-
liest Indiana State Seminary buildings was un-
derway in Bloomington, Indiana. In 1828, the
State Seminary would be renamed Indiana
College. Under the early leadership of inau-
gural President Andrew Wylie, whose term
lasted from 1829 to 1851, the institution in
Bloomington expanded its educational cur-
riculum and transformed from Indiana College
to Indiana University in 1829. Under the lead-
ership of President David Starr Jordan, who
served from 1884 to 1891, Indiana University
saw major increases in enrollment, with the in-
stitution of the elective system. This multiplied
the education offerings and solidified Indiana
University’s reputation as one of the premiere
educational institutions in the United States.
As Indiana University closed out the 19th
century, it became a leader in making higher
education more accessible. As early as 1867,
it became one of the earliest public univer-
sities in the country to admit women on an
equal basis with men. Throughout the 20th
century, Indiana University experienced mas-
sive changes under the direction of legendary
President Herman B. Wells whose term lasted
from 1938 to 1962. Total enrollment sur-
passed the 30,000 student threshold. Much of
this increase coincided with the new opportu-
nities available to military veterans as a result
of the G.I. Bill. Guided by the leadership of
President Wells, the university pursued an ef-
fort to become one of the foremost internation-
ally recognized centers for research and
scholarship. This expansion based a greater
emphasis on academic research in many dif-
ferent areas of study leading to further ad-
vancements in the understanding of both our
natural world and the human condition.
Through these past 200 years, Hoosier stu-
dents have displayed their excellence in the
academic, athletic and cultural arenas, amass-
ing numerous Rhodes Scholar, Marshall
Scholar, and MacArthur Fellow honors in the
classroom, as well as multiple Big Ten Con-
ference and NCAA Championships in Men’s
and Women’s sports. Over the last 200 years
many notable Hoosiers have left their mark on
our society. The university has produced world
political leaders, cabinet members, titans of in-
dustry and commerce, cutting-edge scientific
researchers, artists, Olympians, musicians,
and entertainers.
In addition to the world-renowned under-
graduate opportunities available at Indiana
University, there are also over 400 graduate
degrees and certificates that Indiana Univer-
sity offers students. Many of Indiana Univer-
sity’s graduate schools have become industry
leaders in the areas of medicine, law, busi-
ness, music, media, education, politics, and
the arts. The alumni of the graduate schools
have also had a long and integral hand in the
development of Indiana’s well respected public
and private sectors. The impact of research
conducted by post-graduate students and fac-
ulty at Indiana University has been felt
throughout the world, benefiting untold mil-
lions.
Now well into the 21st century, Indiana Uni-
versity, under the direction of the 18th Presi-
dent Michael McRobbie, has continued its
steadfast charge to be a national leader in
public education. Guided by President
McRobbie, the university has undergone the
largest academic restructuring in its history,
leading to the creation of 10 new schools. In-
diana University has also been dutifully sup-
ported by the many Indiana Governors and In-
diana General Assembly Members over the
past two centuries. Hoosier lawmakers con-
tinue to further the Indiana University commit-
ment of providing students a world-class edu-
cation.
Over 690,000 students and alumni of the 9
campuses throughout the State of Indiana
have been well served by forward-thinking uni-
versity administration officials. The Board of
Trustees, Chancellors, Administration, Faculty,
and Alumni Association members have been
integral to the immense academic and edu-
cational footprint that Indiana University has
developed and maintained. This leadership
has allowed Indiana University to develop over
16 schools and 550 individual degree pro-
grams, keeping Indiana University on the cut-
ting edge of student development and aca-
demic excellence.
I join all current and former Hoosiers in
wishing our beloved alma mater a happy Bi-
centennial Anniversary. Hail to Old I.U.
RECOGNIZING MS. GAYLE BRIDGES
HARRIS ON THE OCCASION OF
HER RETIREMENT FROM 47
YEARS OF PUBLIC HEALTH
SERVICE
HON. G. K. BUTTERFIELD
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, September 27, 2019
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, l rise
to recognize a great American and public
servant, Ms. Gayle Bridges Harris of Durham,
North Carolina. Lauded as a skilled and re-
sourceful community builder and valued public
health leader in Durham, NC, Ms. Harris will
be retiring after 47 years of faithful and dedi-
cated service to the health and well-being of
all those she served. I am honored to share
with my colleagues in the United States House
of Representatives the accomplishments of
this remarkable public servant.
As the 2nd African American student to
graduate from Duke University School of Nurs-
ing, Gayle Harris’ extraordinary career began
in 1970. At 22 years of age, she began work
at Durham County Health Department as a
public health nurse. Ms. Harris’ most recent
role was serving as the Public Health Director
and the General Manager for Community
Well-being for Durham County, North Carolina.
As General Manager for Well-being, Ms.
Harris provided strategic leadership for Dur-
ham County’s Department of Public Health,
Department of Social Services, Cooperative
Extension, Veteran Services and Durham Pub-
lic Libraries. She also served as a lead liaison
between the County and Alliance Behavior
Health Care, Durham Parks and Recreation,
Duke University Health System, Lincoln Com-
munity Health Center, Public and Private Uni-
versities, United Way of the Greater Triangle
and other entities uniquely positioned to pro-
mote Durham’s health indicators to new levels.
With nearly 50 years of service in Durham
County, Ms. Harris has served in several sig-
nificant leadership roles. As Public Health Di-
rector since 2009, she contributed to the de-
sign of and managed the department’s move
into a new Human Services Building in 2011.
At that time, she also played a key role in im-
plementing two innovative programs: the Dur-
ham Diabetes Coalition, a joint venture of Dur-
ham County Department of Public Health with
Duke University Health System to address dia-
betes in the community, and Bull City United,
a violence interruption/reduction initiative. Ms.
Harris was elected to serve as the President
of the North Carolina Public Health Nurse Ad-
ministrators in 1994 and the President of the
North Carolina Public Health Association in
2011.
Gayle Harris is the recipient of numerous
awards: Communities Joined in Action 2014
Grassroots Leaders Award; Senior Pharm As-
sist 2014 Thomas R. Howerton Leadership
Award; NC Association of Local Health Direc-
tors 2013 Ham Stevens Award for Outstanding
Contributions to Local Public Health; Auxiliary
of the Durham Academy of Medicine, Dentistry
& Pharmacy 2012 Legacy Award; Duke Uni-
versity School of Nursing 2012 Distinguished
Alumna Award; and University of North Caro-
lina School of Public Health Alumni Associa-
tion 1995 Distinguished Alumna Award. She
was inducted into Sigma Theta Tau Inter-
national Honor Society of Nursing in 1990.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1228 September 27, 2019
Ms. Harris has served on numerous boards
and committees, including Durham County’s
Strategic Plan Goal Champion (Health and
Well-being for All); Mayor’s Initiative to Re-
duce Poverty One Neighborhood at a Time;
Durham Community Health Network; Project
Access of Durham County Board of Directors
(Vice-Chair); Co-Principal Investigator and
Steering Committee member of the Durham
Diabetes Coalition; United Way of the Greater
Triangle Women’s Leadership Council and
Health Impact Committee; Durham YMCAs;
and the Lincoln Community Health Center
Board of Directors (Secretary).
In 2012, spearheaded by Ms. Harris’s ef-
forts, the Durham County Board of Health,
supported by the County Commissioners and
City officials, adopted a rule to regulate smok-
ing in prescribed public areas. In a city once
dependent on tobacco for its existence, much
of its public space is now smoke free including
parks, bus stops, sidewalks, public indoor
areas such as restrooms, and public areas of
retail establishments.
In 2014, the Durham health community,
under Ms. Harris’ leadership, won the pres-
tigious RWJF Culture of Health award. This
award ‘‘recognizes communities that have
come together around a commitment to
health, opportunity, and equity through col-
laboration and inclusion; especially with his-
torically marginalized populations and those
facing the greatest barriers to good health.’’
Because of Gayle Harris’ leadership and sup-
port, the Durham County Department of Public
Health has led racial equity work within Dur-
ham County Government by hosting racial eq-
uity training and presentations for thousands
of government employees, nonprofit agencies,
businesses, and community members.
Gayle Bridges Harris has played a critical
role in advancing the culture of health in Dur-
ham, North Carolina. She is a health leader
from whom others learn. In her honor, we re-
member that: ‘‘A community’s vitality is built
upon the health of the residents and the ca-
pacity of the community to foster and enhance
the well-being of every citizen.’’
I ask my colleagues to join me today in rec-
ognizing Ms. Gayle Harris on this auspicious
occasion.

LAW ENFORCEMENT
ACTION PARTNERSHIP.
To: Chairwoman Maxine Waters and Mem-
bers of the Subcommittee on Consumer
Protection and Financial Institutions
From: Major Neill Franklin, Ret., on behalf
of the Law Enforcement Action Partner-
ship (LEAP)
Re: Challenges and Solutions: Access to
Banking Services for Cannabis-Related
Businesses
Hearing: Wednesday, February 13, 2019, 2:00
p.m.
Position: Support
Distinguished members of the Committee,
thank you very much for the opportunity to
present the views of the Law Enforcement
Action Partnership (LEAP) in support of this
legislation.
LEAP’s mission is to unite and mobilize
the voice of law enforcement in support of
drug policy and criminal justice reforms that
will make communities safer by focusing law
enforcement resources on the greatest
threats to public safety, promoting alter-
natives to arrest and incarceration, address-
ing the root causes of crime, and working to-
ward healing police-community relations.
‘‘LEAP envisions a world in which crimi-
nal justice and drug policies keep our com-
munities safer.’’ This is a quote directly
from our website and that quote is exactly
what this hearing is about. It is about enact-
ing policy that will dramatically enhance
public safety in our communities.
This hearing is not, nor should it be, a
hearing about whether we should legalize,
regulate, and control marijuana for adult
use. It should be clear to everyone here that
Americans have already decided this issue.
In October, Gallup said 66% of American
residents supported legalizing marijuana.
More than half of states already allow mari-
juana for medical and/or adult-use purposes.
A vast majority of Americans live in a state
where marijuana can be purchased legally.
This is not a niche business market; it’s a
significant part of our economy.
If Congress respects the rights of the states
and the will of the people, as protected in the
Tenth Amendment, then we don’t need to de-
bate the legalization of marijuana or med-
ical marijuana here today. We need to decide
how best to protect those states, given the
choices they’ve democratically enacted.
However, I know some opponents will try to
cloud the banking issue with attacks on le-
galization, so I will quickly address some of
these concerns.
Let’s talk about what’s happened in Colo-
rado, the first state to legalize marijuana for
adult use. A federal study by the National
Survey on Drug Use and Health showed that
teen marijuana use decreased after legaliza-
tion. The American Public Health Associa-
tion determined that ‘‘motor vehicle crash
fatality rates . . . were not statistically dif-
ferent from those in similar states without
recreational marijuana legalization.’’ Fur-
thermore, legalization has resulted in a sig-
nificant decrease in traffic stops, leading to
fewer negative interactions between police
and drivers, potentially limiting dangerous
clashes and tensions with people of color.
And because police didn’t have to waste their
time on these stops and could concentrate on
real crime, researchers studying Uniform
Crime Reports data (another federal publica-
tion) concluded legalization had resulted in
greater police clearance rates. So don’t lis-
ten to Chicken Little. The sky over Colorado
did not fall.
Licensed marijuana businesses are legiti-
mate contributors to our economy. It follows
that regulated banking, vendor relations,
payroll, and tax payments should be per-
mitted as part of that legitimacy—a condi-
tion that will further serve to dismantle the
illicit market’s influence in this growing in-
dustry and help local economies.
Current conditions, which require all-cash
transactions in every aspect of the business
encourage tax fraud, add expensive moni-
toring and bookkeeping expenses, and—most
importantly—leave legitimate businesses
vulnerable to theft, robbery, and the vio-
lence that accompany those crimes. The
SAFE Banking Act presents us with an op-
portunity to greatly assist in stabilizing the
industry and enhancing public safety.
As more legitimate businesses are estab-
lished, opportunities for cash robberies will
increase as more grow-facilities and
dispensaries come on line. Securing cash on-
site, transporting cash to secure locations,
and managing cash payroll are necessities
for these businesses. And criminal entities
are quite adept at conducting high-level re-
connaissance of businesses and their security
protocols when they know those businesses
will have tens of thousands—or even hun-
dreds of thousands—of dollars on hand.
Although extremely important for business
owners and the people they employ, my
greatest fear is not the loss of profits due to
theft. It is the potential for serious assaults
and death to the people attempting to pro-
tect that cash, or who are merely responsible
for it. I fear dispensary employees being at
great risk. I fear for the safety of those
transporting the cash, and I fear for the well-
being of employees on payday. Two weeks of
pay for one employee can easily exceed a few
thousand dollars. That one employee trying
to get home safely from work is an attrac-
tive ‘‘score’’ for any criminal, and a very
easy target for those who know what to look
for. Beyond any concern for protecting prof-
it, we have a duty to protect the lives of
community members working to earn a liv-
ing.
In 2012, Melinda Haag, the U.S. Attorney
for Northern California, said, ‘‘Marijuana
dispensaries are full of cash, they are at risk
of being robbed, and many of them are.’’ One
example of what can happen: In October 2012,
three people kidnapped the owner of a lucra-
tive dispensary in Orange County. According
to court documents, the assailants zip-tied
the victim, tortured him, and drove him to a
patch of desert where they believed he had
buried large sums of money. When the kid-
nappers couldn’t find it, they burned him
with a blowtorch, cut off his penis, and
doused him with bleach before dumping him
along the side of a road.
Four of my policing years were spent in-
vestigating crimes within Maryland’s Divi-
sion of Corrections. I’ve interviewed hun-
dreds of incarcerated civilians convicted of
serious crimes, many of whom were proud to
boast of their criminal activities and strate-
gies. Their strategic thought process is mini-
mal. The easier the target the better. The
bigger the ‘‘score’’ the better. Casing the
next target is about finding the softest tar-
get, and the current conditions in this indus-
try have created many soft targets.
We, the police, teach target hardening
when we conduct security assessments for
business owners. Our advice to them is not to

have large amounts of cash on hand, to make
use of credit and debit card services, avoid
routine trips to the bank, and to make use of
armored car services. This valuable ‘‘crime
prevention 101’’ advice is literally useless to
marijuana business owners, making them
very attractive soft targets.
I’m not one for fear mongering—what I tes-
tify to here today is rooted in experience and
research. Any police officer who has worked
the street, or investigated enough robberies,
will testify to the same regarding any busi-
ness forced to handle large amounts of cash.
Members of the committee, it is up to you
and other members of Congress to act upon
this legislation, establishing access to bank-
ing for legitimate marijuana businesses. The
safety of thousands of employees, business
owners, security personnel, police officers,
and community members is in your hands.
On behalf of myself and the Law Enforce-
ment Action Partnership, I ask that you act
swiftly on the SAFE Banking Act because we
know it will enhance public safety within
our communities. Thank you for your time.
Sincerely,
MAJOR NEILL FRANKLIN, RET.,
Executive Director.
ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS
ASSOCIATION,
Washington, DC, March 26, 2019.
Hon. MAXINE WATERS,
Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
Hon. PATRICK MCHENRY,
Ranking Member, Committee on Financial Serv-
ices, House of Representatives, Washington,
DC.
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS AND RANKING
MEMBER MCHENRY: On behalf of the members
of the Electronic Transactions Association
(ETA), I am writing in support of H.R. 1595,
the bipartisan Secure and Fair Enforcement
Banking Act of 2019 (SAFE Banking Act),
which would allow states that have legalized
medical or recreational use of marijuana to
bring that commerce into the banking sys-
tem.
ETA is the leading trade association for
the payments industry, representing over 500
companies that offer electronic transaction
processing products and services; its mem-
bership spans the breadth of the payments
industry to include independent sales organi-
zations, payments networks, financial insti-
tutions, transaction processors, mobile pay-
ments products and services, payments tech-
nologies, equipment suppliers, and online
small business lenders.
Thirty-three states and several U.S. terri-
tories have legalized marijuana for medical
use and ten states have done so for rec-
reational use. Financial institutions pro-
viding services to state-licensed cannabis
businesses could find themselves subject to
criminal and civil liability under the Con-
trolled Substances Act and federal banking
statutes because the use and possession of
marijuana is illegal under federal law.
The conflict between state and federal laws
forces businesses to operate on a cash-only
basis and has created significant legal and
compliance concerns for financial institu-
tions that wish to provide banking services
to marijuana related businesses in states
where it is currently legal. The SAFE Bank-
ing Act would allow legitimate marijuana
businesses to access the safety and security
of the banking ecosystem in states that have
legalized marijuana. Having access to the
banking system makes it easier for busi-
nesses to track revenues for taxation pur-
poses, decreases a public safety threat as
cash intensive businesses are often targets
for criminal activity, and allows proper
tracking of finances for BSA/AML compli-
ance.
With the clarifications to Section 4 in the
amendment in the nature of a substitute, the
SAFE Banking Act would extend the same
protections to payment processors as banks
and credit unions by prohibiting federal
banking regulators from taking adverse ac-
tions against financial institutions. This up-
dated language allows the entire scope of
these legitimate businesses to access the en-
tire banking ecosystem—including any enti-
ty performing a financial service in associa-
tion with a depository institute.
ETA takes no position on the legalization
or decriminalizing marijuana at the state or
federal level for medicinal or recreational
uses. However, ETA does support legislation
that would resolve the conflict between state
and federal laws to allow financial institu-
tions to serve marijuana related businesses
in states where these businesses are legal
under state law.
We appreciate your leadership on this im-
portant issue. If you have any questions,
please feel free to contact me directly.
Sincerely,
SCOTT TALBOTT,
Senior Vice President of Government Affairs.
THIRD PARTY PAYMENT
PROCESSORS ASSOCIATION (TPPPA),
Washington, DC, September 24, 2019.
Re H.R. 1595, Secure and Fair Enforcement
Banking Act of 2019.
Hon. MAXINE WATERS,
Chairwoman, House Financial Services Com-
mittee, House of Representatives, Wash-
ington, DC.
Hon. PATRICK MCHENRY,
Ranking Member, House Financial Services
Committee, House of Representatives, Wash-
ington, DC.
Hon. ED PERLMUTTER,
House Financial Services Committee, House of
Representatives, Washington, DC.
The Third Party Payment Processors Asso-
ciation (TPPPA) is writing in support of
H.R. 1595, the Secure and Fair Enforcement
Banking Act of 2019 (SAFE Banking Act).
The TPPPA agrees that action by the federal
government is the only durable solution to
the challenges posed by conflicting state and
federal laws related to cannabis and are
eager for a roadmap to compliance related to
cannabis-related businesses for banks and
payment processors.
The Third Party Payment Processors Asso-
ciation (TPPPA) is a national not-for-profit
industry association whose members include
payment processors and banks. The TPPPA
has created industry best practices in pay-
ment processing through our Compliance
Management System (CMS), which relies
heavily on the guidance of federal regu-
lators. The CMS serves as guidance to our
members in creating documented, risk-based
compliance management programs for pay-
ment processing.
The SAFE Banking Act would allow the
opportunity for our members to provide
banking and payment processing services to
cannabis-related businesses in states that
have legalized medical or recreational use of
cannabis. The SAFE Banking Act would har-
monize the conflict between state and fed-
eral laws related to financial services, there-
by reducing the reluctance of banks and pay-
ment processors, like our members, to pro-
vide critical financial services to these busi-
nesses. The SAFE Banking Act will have the
benefit of removing cash, resulting in im-
proved public safety and providing greater fi-
nancial transparency, reducing the risk of
money laundering.
Payment processors are a key component
in reducing cash transactions and keeping
money in the financial system. Payment
processors include not only companies that
facilitate the collection of payments, but
also includes payroll processors. Payment
processing in the form of either the collec-
tion of payments or processing of payroll
and/or vendor payments removes the han-
dling of cash. In the absence of payment
processing, companies are required to hold
large amounts of cash. Customers and em-
ployees of merchants without payment proc-
essing capability, like cannabis-related in-
dustries, are also required to carry and
transact with cash. Consider the employee
that must hand-deliver cash from their pay-
roll to their bank, if they are even afforded
a bank account due to being related to a can-
nabis business. This creates a great public
safety issue not only for businesses, but also
for consumers.
Payment processors are unable to provide
payment services without a bank to sponsor
these payments into the various payments
networks, (e.g. check, ACH, debit/credit
cards). Payment processors act as service
providers to both the banks and the mer-
chants. (This is not necessarily obvious, and
the TPPPA was glad to see specific reference
made to payment processors.) Without the
safeguards afforded by the SAFE Banking
Act, particularly related to FDIC insurance
and regulatory enforcement, there are very
few banks that are able to reconcile the risks
with the opportunities to provide services to
this ever-growing sector. Without banks,
there are no payment processors.
We are encouraged by Representative
Perlmutter’s willingness to consider the ad-
dition of related topics. There are two other
cannabis-related business matters of impor-
tance to the TPPPA members addressed
below.
Operation Choke Point
The TPPPA believes that cannabis-related
businesses are subject to moral bias. While
the SAFE Banking Act does prohibit finan-
cial regulators from using their regulatory
enforcement authority solely based upon the
fact that the company or service provider is
a cannabis-related business, it does not pre-
clude these same agencies from using their
authority based upon reputation risk. As
such, we strongly urge the inclusion of lan-
guage, or merging of H.R. 189—Financial In-
stitution Customer Protection Act, which
has received overwhelming bipartisan sup-
port.
Hemp/CBD-Related Businesses
Other guidance that is notably absent, yet
still a critical piece to being able to fully ad-
dress compliance requirements for providing
financial services and payment processing to
cannabis-related businesses is USDA guid-
ance on hemp. With the passing of the 2018
Farm Bill, the opportunity for providing
services to the Hemp/CBD industry is imme-
diately appealing to many of our members.
Many banks and payment processors that
may be reluctant to banking marijuana at
this time, are open and eager to provide fi-
nancial services to hemp-related businesses
but cannot do so with a reasonable level of
certainty without the USDA guidance on the
regulatory requirements for hemp. Absent
this guidance, hemp, in particular CBD, can-
not be readily differentiated from marijuana.
While the SAFE Banking Act would provide
some protection in this regard, it does not
provide those banks and payment processors
that are open to CBD, but prohibit mari-
juana, the ability to know that they are not
inadvertently engaging in marijuana. The
TPPPA urges the escalation of USDA guid-
ance on the requirements of hemp.
TPPPA members are eager for the clarity
afforded by federal regulatory guidance re-
lated to banking cannabis. We are encour-
aged to see that the SAFE Banking Act pro-
vides for the timely creation of regulatory

This will allow the TPPPA to include this
guidance in our best practices. We are grate-

and opinions with The Committee.

THE REAL ESTATE ROUNDTABLE,
Washington, DC, March 25, 2019.
Hon. MAXINE WATERS,
Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services,
House of Representatives.
Hon. JERROLD NADLER,
Chair, Committee on the Judiciary,

Ranking Member, Committee on Financial Serv-

Hon. DOUG COLLINS,

DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS, CHAIRMAN
NADLER, AND RANKING MEMBERS MCHENRY
AND COLLINS: We represent members involved
in almost every aspect of residential and
commercial real estate development, design,
construction, ownership, management, fi-
nance, and brokerage. Our members provide
the homes, apartments, health care facili-
ties, offices, industrial sites, shopping cen-
ters, and hotels where the American people
live, work, play, and heal.
We support the broadly bipartisan H.R.
1595, the Secure and Fair Enforcement
(‘‘SAFE’’) Banking Act. The bill has been re-
ferred to your committees and is scheduled
for markup tomorrow by the Financial Serv-
ices Committee. The measure will bring
state-licensed cannabis-related businesses
(‘‘CRBs’’) into the federal banking system. If
enacted, federally regulated banks would no
longer face the threat of sanction simply by
providing financial services to a legitimate
CRB.
Furthermore, H.R. 1595 clarifies that banks
could not take adverse action on a loan to a
real estate owner solely because that owner
leases property to a legitimate CRB. The
measure also protects sellers and lessors of
real estate and other CRB ‘‘service pro-
viders’’ by clarifying that proceeds from le-
gitimate marijuana-related transactions do
not derive from unlawful activity, and thus
do not provide a predicate for federal crimi-
nal money laundering.
There is a deepening rift between federal
and state laws regarding cannabis policy. Ac-
cording to the National Conference of State
Legislatures, all but four (4) states have en-
acted some form of public marijuana access
to this point. At the federal level, however,
the Controlled Substances Act classifies
marijuana as a ‘‘schedule 1’’ drug rendering
its use, possession, and sale illegal. This fed-
eral-state conflict leaves banks and real es-
tate providers trapped between their mission
to serve the needs of lawful businesses in
their local communities, and the threat of
federal enforcement action. The SAFE Bank-
ing Act provides much-needed clarity for the
banking, real estate, and business sectors to
function within the contours of state laws
that have legalized marijuana.
Without a bank account, dispensaries and
other legal CRBs must operate on a cash
basis. Risks of crime thus increase and tax
revenues to pay for infrastructure and other
government services are potentially lost.
H.R. 1595 can significantly address these
problems by providing protections for banks,
real estate firms and their employees from
punishment simply because they aim to
serve businesses within the 46 states that
have legalized marijuana to varying degrees.
Passage of the SAFE Banking Act is a
strong first step to clarify a full range of
proper business conduct in the rapidly evolv-
ing context of cannabis policy. We rec-
ommend that Congress further pass the bi-
partisan Strengthening the Tenth Amend-
ment through Entrusting States Act
(‘‘STATES Act,’’ H.R. 6043 last Congress).
The STATES Act more holistically addresses
financial issues caused by the federal mari-
juana prohibition. It provides that state-
compliant transactions are not ‘‘trafficking’’
and do not result in unlawful proceeds. Bro-
kerage, investment, transportation, adver-
tising and other commercial transactions in-
trinsic and ancillary to real estate services
could function more productively with
STATES Act safeguards.
We commend Representatives Perlmutter
(D–CO), Heck (D–WA), Stivers (R–OH), and
Davidson (R–OH) for originally introducing
the SAFE Banking Act, and the dozens of
members who have joined as co-sponsors.
The Real Estate Roundtable urges H.R. 1595’s
swift enactment. For more information,
please contact Duane J. Desiderio, Senior
Vice President and Counsel.

President and Chief Executive Officer.
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION
OF REALTORS,
Washington, DC, September 23, 2019.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Washington, DC.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the
more than 1.3 million members of the Na-
tional Association of REALTORS® (NAR)
and its affiliate, the Institute of Real Estate
Management (IREM), I urge you to pass H.R.
1595, the ‘‘Secure and Fair Enforcement
(SAFE) Banking Act of 2019,’’ when it is con-
sidered on the House floor this week. This bi-
partisan bill, introduced by Representatives
Ed Perlmutter (D–CO).and Steve Stivers (R–
OH), provides a clear framework for cannabis
businesses to access financial services. As
more states legalize cannabis use, the indus-
try continues to rapidly grow, with more
than $10 billion in sales and $1 billion in
state tax revenue already recorded. However,
barriers preventing these state-legal busi-
nesses from accessing federally-insured
banks can impede their ability to grow while
raising safety issues in their communities.
Thirty-three states have legalized cannabis
for medical or recreational use, a number
that is expected to rise over the coming
years. Despite this, current federal law pre-
vents banks from working with cannabis
businesses or ancillary businesses that pro-
vide them with goods and services—including
real estate professionals who have cannabis
business owners as their clients. As a result,
those states are struggling to address signifi-
cant challenges to public safety and the reg-
ulatory compliance issues that arise with
cash-only businesses.
The SAFE Banking Act takes an impor-
tant step toward enabling financial services
for legitimate cannabis-related businesses by
specifying that their proceeds will not be
considered unlawful under federal money
laundering laws, thus allowing these busi-
nesses access to federally-insured banking
institutions. Further, it directs the Finan-
cial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)
and federal banking regulators to issue guid-
ance and exam procedures for banks working
with cannabis businesses. As the legal state-
cannabis industry grows, the connections to
other types of industries—including real es-
tate—will grow as well. The SAFE Banking
Act not only gives the industry equal footing
with other businesses, enabling it to con-
tinue to expand and stimulate the economy,
but also provides oversight and improves fi-
nancial transparency.
State-legal cannabis businesses require
real estate—farmland, warehouses, and
storefronts—creating multiple contacts to
other industries and businesses, each of
which is affected by current laws keeping
their money out of the bank system. The
SAFE Banking Act provides clarity for busi-
ness owners, banks, and regulators in the
cannabis industry while promoting safety
and ensuring further growth within the U.S.
economy.
REALTORS® thank you for your diligent
work to help provide access and clarity to le-
gitimate businesses in those states that have
legalized cannabis, which in turn will boost
economic growth in real estate and other in-
dustries around the country.
Sincerely,
JOHN SMABY,
2019 President.

CHAIRWOMAN WATERS, CONGRESSMAN PERL-

MEMBERS: I am writing on behalf of the Safe
and Responsible Banking Alliance
(‘‘SARBA’’), a coalition of financial institu-
tions, associations, governments, and busi-
ness groups advocating for a solution to fed-
eral cannabis banking prohibitions. SARBA
supports the Secure and Fair Enforcement
(SAFE) Banking Act of 2019, which would ad-
dress many of the key problems associated
with the cannabis industry’s lack of access
to financial institutions. We thank the Com-
mittee for holding a hearing on the legisla-
tion and urge swift action to bring the bill to
the House floor.
States are rapidly updating and revising
existing cannabis policy, and forty-seven
states have laws acknowledging the medical
benefits of medical cannabis. Of those, thir-
ty-three have enacted legislation that allows
for the production and sale of medical can-
nabis, including nine that allow the sale of
cannabis for adult personal use. Dozens of
states are considering expanding and imple-
menting new cannabis policies during their
current legislative sessions. Unfortunately,
federal cannabis laws remain markedly dis-
connected from the reality of what is hap-
pening in the states. Cannabis is still consid-
ered an illegal substance under federal law,
which means that cannabis-related busi-
nesses cannot utilize traditional banking
services. The problems that arise from this
lack of access are at once substantial and
largely avoidable, if we follow the course
charted by the SAFE Banking Act.
When cannabis industry businesses are de-
nied access to financial institutions, they
are forced to operate and purchase using
cash alone. This poses obvious public safety
dangers, including the potential for an in-
crease in violent crimes. Communities will
be safer if cannabis-related funds can be elec-
tronically-transferred and deposited in regu-
lated financial institutions—yet our current
laws make this nearly impossible. The SAFE
Banking Act would change this by creating
protections for financial institutions that
work with the cannabis industry. The sooner
we move forward with the SAFE Banking
Act, the safer it will be for those working in
and around the regulated cannabis industry.
The SAFE Banking Act will improve con-
ditions not only for the public, but for finan-
cial institutions as well. Even in jurisdic-
tions where cannabis is legal, financial insti-
tutions face the potential for risk because

funds involved in cannabis transactions
could be considered illegally-gained by fed-
eral regulators and law enforcement. This
discourages banks from working with the in-
dustry, providing loans to cannabis and an-
cillary businesses, and maintaining personal
accounts for individuals who work for these
businesses. Further, under current policy,
banks are forced to make determinations
about how to deal with existing and new cos-
tumers who are ancillary to the cannabis in-
dustry, such as plumbers, electricians, and
horticulturists.
While approximately 500 institutions are
known to be working with the cannabis in-
dustry, most financial institutions are hesi-
tant to become involved in the industry due
to a lack of clarity surrounding cannabis
laws. Federal law paints any dollar that
flows through the cannabis industry as
tainted, but such broad brush strokes pro-
vide little certainty to financial institu-
tions. Financial institutions may feel com-
pelled to cancel the account of someone who
works in the cannabis industry. All deposi-
tory institutions have to consider how to
handle an individual’s cash deposits that
may have at some time been involved in a le-
gitimate cannabis related transaction. Such
dilemmas reveal the broad reach of the can-
nabis industry. Under current federal law,
banks interacting with these customers are
at risk. Financial institutions cannot help
but be exposed to potential consequences, be-
cause the cannabis industry is intertwined
with so many other legitimate businesses
that support the burgeoning marijuana in-
dustry.
The SAFE Banking Act is a critical first
step to addressing the potential risk created
by the inescapable comingling of cannabis-
related funds with ancillary business and in-
dividual accounts. By clarifying federal can-
nabis regulations, including money laun-
dering issues and Suspicious Activity Re-
ports (SARs), the SAFE Banking Act would
make it much safer for financial institutions
to process cannabis-related transactions.
In addition, the SAFE Banking Act could
increase access to capital among demo-
graphics that have been disproportionately
disadvantaged by the federal prohibition of
cannabis. This bill would allow financial in-
stitutions to provide small business loans for
cannabis-related businesses, allowing those
with the least access to capital—often mi-
norities—to participate in the new legal can-
nabis industry. Congress has an opportunity
and responsibility to help this process move
forward.
Addressing the existing banking options
could also improve patient access in the 33
states with medical marijuana programs.
Currently patients and caregivers who rely
on medical marijuana are forced to pay out
of pocket because no state or private insur-
ance company will cover the treatment.
Compounding this significant financial
strain is the fact that these are almost ex-
clusively cash transactions, because credit
or debit cards—including HSA/FSA cards and
accounts—cannot be used in cannabis-related
transactions. Families are thus forced to
choose between coming up with large sums
of cash each month and forgoing other basic
needs, or going without necessary medica-
tion. Many state legitimate medical can-
nabis businesses that are working with
banks are forced to pay large monthly fees.
For those not working with banks or credit
unions there are significant costs related to
necessary security measures. If medical can-
nabis businesses are better able to work with
financial institutions, this could signifi-
cantly reduce the cost of medication. By
opening up financial services to the cannabis
industry, the SAFE Banking Act could in-
crease patient access to medical cannabis
which is disproportionately high due in part
due to a lack of banking access.
With two out of every three Americans liv-
ing somewhere that allows the legal pur-
chase of marijuana, it is long past time that
the federal government enact policies to re-
solve the conflict between existing policy
and state laws. Cannabis banking reform is
an important issue facing members of the
116th Congress, and the SAFE Banking Act
would be a significant step in the right direc-
tion.
SARBA is pleased to support the SAFE
Banking Act, and would urge the House Fi-
nancial Services Committee to move swiftly
to consider this important legislation.
Sincerely,
BECKY DANSKY,
Executive Director.
