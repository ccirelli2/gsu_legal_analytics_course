So the amendment was agreed to.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
AMENDMENT NO. 48 OFFERED BY MR. JEFFRIES
The Acting CHAIR (Ms. PLASKETT).
It is now in order to consider amend-
ment No. 48 printed in part B of House
Report 116–109.
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Chairwoman,
I have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division A (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll. None of the funds made available
by this Act may be used in contravention of
section 203 of the Department of Education
Organization Act (20 U.S.C. 3413).
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentleman
from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New York.
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Chairwoman,
let me first just thank the distin-
guished gentlewoman from Con-
necticut, the chair of the sub-
committee, for her tremendous work in
connection with this bill.
The mission of the Office for Civil
Rights is to ensure access to education
and to promote educational excellence
throughout the Nation through vig-
orous enforcement of civil rights. How-
ever, this administration and Sec-
retary DeVos have methodically
worked to limit the effectiveness of the
Office for Civil Rights at the Depart-
ment of Education.
This amendment would prohibit any
funds in the underlying measure to be
used to thwart the important work
that is done by the Office for Civil
Rights. This administration has gone
out of its way to hurt students of color
and undermine diversity in a variety of
ways. They have eliminated guidance,
encouraging schools to endeavor to-
wards diversity in admissions, and they
have rescinded guidance issued by the
previous administration directing
schools to reduce racial disparities in
how they discipline students.
Frederick Douglass said: ‘‘It is easier
to build strong children than it is to
repair broken men.’’
Excellence in academic and edu-
cational preparation is an important
part of the American Dream, and every
single child in this country, regardless
of race, regardless of gender, and re-
gardless of religion should have access
to the highest quality education. That
is the mission of the Department of
Education and the role of the Office for
Civil Rights within that department.
By prohibiting the use of funds in the
underlying measure from being used to
limit the functions of the Office for
Civil Rights, we are taking a necessary
step toward ensuring that in this coun-
try, the pursuit of excellence in edu-
cation will be available to every single
child.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment, and I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO), the distinguished chair of
the subcommittee.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chairwoman,
I thank the gentleman for yielding.
I rise in support of this amendment
and the Department of Education Of-
fice for Civil Rights. The legacy of ac-
cess to education in America is inter-
twined with the legacy of civil rights
in this country. Education remains a
civil rights issue today.
The Office for Civil Rights has as its
mission, ‘‘ . . . to ensure equal access
to education and to promote edu-
cational excellence through vigorous
enforcement,’’ and I underscore, ‘‘vig-
orous enforcement of civil rights in our
Nation’s schools.’’
b 0100
There are strong concerns, very
strong concerns, that this Department
of Education’s Office of Civil Rights is
not upholding this mission. This
amendment would ensure that the crit-
ical mission of OCR is not undermined
and that equal access and treatment is
present throughout our Nation’s
schools. I support my colleague’s
amendment.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I claim
the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Chair, I yield
1 minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Massachusetts (Ms.
PRESSLEY).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4605
June 12, 2019
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Chair, I rise
today in support of this amendment
and applaud my friend and colleague,
Representative JEFFRIES, for his lead-
ership in the fight against this cal-
loused administration and its efforts to
roll back critical civil rights protec-
tions for millions of students across
this country.
Under Secretary DeVos’ failed leader-
ship, OCR has scuttled more than 1,200
civil rights complaints, hastily dis-
missing cases, closing investigations,
and depriving students and families of
justice.
At the same time, the Education De-
partment has taken one action after
another to make schools less safe for
Black and Brown students, queer and
trans students, students with disabil-
ities, and sexual assault survivors.
The Department has rescinded crit-
ical Obama-era guidance intended to
protect students from excessive dis-
ciplinary practices that disproportion-
ately push out Black and Brown stu-
dents and students with disabilities
and exacerbate the school-to-prison
pipeline.
The agency has proposed rules that
would make it harder for survivors of
sexual violence to seek justice and
easier for K–12 schools and universities
to sweep these cases under the rug.
Instead of ensuring that all students
have access to quality education, she
embraces and promotes private schools
and voucher schemes that would funnel
Federal funds to schools that explicitly
discriminate against LGBTQ students,
all while defanging the very office in-
tended to enforce the law and do right
by students and families.
Our amendment would block Sec-
retary DeVos’ efforts to dismantle this
office. We finally say enough is enough.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I am not
sure what this amendment does be-
cause it just says that you can’t
change the Office of Civil Rights in
contravention of the statute that set
up the Department. There is no change
in the Office of Civil Rights.
The bottom line is that the Depart-
ment of Education enforces civil rights
laws. Yes, there was misguided guid-
ance by the last administration that
actually decreased discipline in the
schools in my district because the
teachers in my district and the admin-
istrators in my district were scared
that they would lose Federal funds if
they disciplined students because they
had to do paperwork, and there were
reports, and the Department of Edu-
cation was going to come down on
them. Discipline suffered.
The bottom line is that the record of
this administration on minorities is
clear: the lowest unemployment in his-
tory for African Americans in the
country and the lowest unemployment
in history for Hispanics in this coun-
try.
The record of this administration in
dealing with minorities is clear. It has
provided economic opportunity for tens
of millions of minorities in this coun-
try. The Office of Civil Rights works in
the Department of Education, and I op-
pose the amendment.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Chair, the
Brown v. Board of Education decision
was a historic and important step and
a strong step in the right direction. We
have come a long way in this country,
but we still have a long way to go as it
relates to providing equal access to
education.
This amendment is pretty simple. It
says to the Secretary: Keep your hands
off the Office of Civil Rights.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, we have
heard the debate. I don’t know if
vouchers are brought into this debate.
It is interesting because, with vouch-
ers like the OSP program in the Dis-
trict of Columbia, 97 percent of the stu-
dents are minorities. That is a voucher
program, and 97 percent are minorities
supported by the administration. The
majority just yesterday rejected an in-
crease in funding to that program that
benefits 97 percent that are minorities.
Let’s get civil rights straight. If my
colleagues support opportunity and
education for minorities in this coun-
try, that is what the administration is
doing.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-

ceedings on the amendment offered by

AMENDMENT NO. 49 OFFERED BY MR. SEAN

The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 49 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of
New York. Madam Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:

$5,000,000) (increased by $5,000,000)’’.

from New York (Mr. SEAN PATRICK
MALONEY) and a Member opposed each
will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New York.
Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of
New York. Madam Chair, I rise today
on the anniversary of a day 3 years ago
when we were mourning a terrible loss
because of a gun massacre in Florida
that affected my community in par-
ticular.
I rise to offer an amendment to the
Department of Labor, HHS, and Edu-
cation Appropriations Act that will set
aside $5 million of funding for gun vio-
lence research in our schools. This bill
rightfully includes $25 million for gun
violence research funding at the Cen-
ters for Disease Control. This funding
is critical when 100 Americans die
every day because of gun violence.
Ninety-four schools across our coun-
try had shooting incidents last year.
That is the largest number of school
shootings in a single year since 1970.
The other side has held gun violence
research hostage for more than two
decades by refusing to appropriate
dedicated funds for gun violence re-
search—just research. Now that we are
finally able to look into this public
health crisis, we need to address it
head-on.
As a Representative and as a dad who
sends his kids to public school every
day and whose worst nightmare is that
someone will use a gun to hurt them or
their friends, I am asking that we take
action to stop school shootings now.
The lives and safety of our kids are at
risk, all of our kids, and we have al-
most no data on what is happening.
This funding will treat gun violence
in our schools just like we treat any
other public health crisis and finally
give the CDC the funding it desperately
needs to help us find answers on how to
address these ongoing acts of violence.
As we know, quality data can lead to
breakthrough solutions. Investing in
research on car accidents and the risk
of smoking has led to policies that
have saved countless lives. We can fi-
nally free and empower researchers to
study the unique impacts and causes of
gun violence in schools, examine the
data, and formulate solutions that will
save lives, children’s lives.
I urge support of my amendment.
Madam Chair, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO) for her remarks.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of this amendment that
calls for the CDC to specifically study
the impact of firearm violence in ele-
mentary and secondary schools and
higher education institutions.
Earlier this year, our subcommittee
held a hearing on gun violence preven-
tion research. I might add, it was the
first one we have been able to hold in
20 years in this institution, 20 years
until we were able to have a hearing on
gun violence prevention and research.
We highlighted that gun violence is a
public health emergency and that it
needs to be responded to with evidence-
based interventions. Just as we do for
other public health challenges, we
must conduct research to know how to
best address the impact and which
interventions will be most effective.
The underlying bill that we are con-
sidering tonight includes $50 million of
dedicated funding for firearm injury
and mortality research at the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention and
the National Institutes of Health. This

amendment specifically focuses on the
impact of firearm violence on students
in our schools and higher education in-
stitutions.
Unfortunately, so many communities
have students who have been affected
by firearm violence. In my own State
of Connecticut, we have all been af-
fected by the tragedy at Sandy Hook
Elementary School in 2012, a slaughter
of the innocents.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I rise in

New York. Madam Chair, I yield back

Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, read the
plain language of the amendment. It
decreases an amount, and it increases
an amount. That is all it does. It
doesn’t increase funding for firearm vi-
olence.
If the gentleman were so interested
in doing more, more research, he could
have increased the amount. He didn’t
increase the amount.
At 1 o’clock in the morning, we are
talking about a do-nothing amendment
instead of bringing a supplemental bill
to the floor that funds the care of chil-
dren at our border that has been re-
jected by the majority time and time

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from North Carolina.
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Chair, I want to
first offer my thanks to Chairwoman
DELAURO and our other appropriators
for their tireless work on this year’s
Labor-HHS bill.
I offer this amendment to recognize
the important work of the National
Center for College Students with Dis-
abilities and to press the Senate to act.
The national center, located in
Huntersville, North Carolina, sets as
its mission to improve retention and
graduation rates of U.S. college stu-
dents with disabilities. It accomplishes
this through technical assistance and
outreach and the dissemination of
peer-reviewed research that tries to de-
termine the needs of disabled college
students, their families, disabled serv-
ice providers, and higher education
staff and faculty.
Additionally, the center has devel-
oped and is constantly updating a pub-
lic clearinghouse that contains dis-
ability resources at institutions of
higher education across the U.S. This
allows disabled students to access cru-
cial information to intelligently assess
their higher education options.
Last but not least, the center empow-
ers its students through the dissemina-
tion of a weekly newsletter that re-
ports current events and news about
the disabled in higher education, pro-
mulgated by its student group DREAM,
or Disability Rights, Education, Activ-
ism, and Mentoring.
To sum up, the center has been a god-
send for the 20 percent of college stu-
dents who have some form of disability
since its $2.5 million authorization in
2015, and that expires at the end of this
fiscal year.
Madam Chair, this amendment would
add $500,000 to the higher education ac-
count, which funds the national center.
If passed, it will be used in conference
with the Senate to justify a new au-
thorization.
Without more funding, the center
will close in June 2020, wasting 5 years’
worth of taxpayer dollars used to cre-
ate groundbreaking research for our
disabled students. It would leave thou-
sands of higher education staff, fac-
ulty, and students without support for
the disabled in higher education.
The center has bipartisan support on
the Education and Labor Committee,
and it is expected to be included in the
next Higher Education Act reauthor-
ization.
I thank the chair of the Higher Edu-
cation and Workforce Development
Subcommittee, Representative SUSAN
DAVIS, as well as Representatives
HUFFMAN, MOULTON, BONAMICI, and
LOWENTHAL for cosponsoring this
amendment, and I urge the House for
its support.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance

Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment, even
though I don’t oppose the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Maryland is
recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, this is a
modest request, but it is offset by a re-
duction in departmental management
funds.
Now, there are a number of amend-
ments that do that. Obviously, if we do
too many amendments that do that,
you will leave nothing for the depart-
ment to be properly managed. But this
is a modest request, so I believe we
should support the amendment.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Ms. DELAURO).
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of this amendment. It draws
attention to the importance of the Na-
tional Center for College Students with
Disabilities.
The center is the only Federally
funded national center in the country
for college and graduate students with
any type of disabilities, chronic health
conditions, or mental or emotional ill-
ness.
It supports students with disabilities
in higher education and provides tech-
nical assistance to students, to faculty,
and to families.
I thank the gentlewoman for offering
this amendment and am happy to ac-
cept it.

a line item for the Social Services/In-
come Maintenance Research program,
as well as report language to support
Community Resource Centers.
These centers, or CRCs, as they are
called, help administer social programs
such as Medicaid, WIC, and SNAP. But,
unlike other State one-stop shops,
CRCs have completely integrated serv-
ices, which allow for greater efficiency.
Instead of repeating their story to
multiple administrative staff during
the screening process, customers can
be screened and assessed at one central
administrative service area, which pro-
vides initial screening and assessment
for all programs and services offered in
the CRC.
If a customer needs to access mul-
tiple county services or partner agen-
cies, staff arranges cross-service co-
ordination, which allows individuals to
assess their eligibility and apply for
multiple Federal programs in a quick,
efficient manner.
H.R. 2740 will, for the first time,
allow the Federal Government to
evaluate the viability of CRCs and de-
termine whether their expansion can
help save taxpayer money and make
social services more accessible to ev-
eryday Americans.
That is not all that CRCs do. They
also partner with local workforce de-
velopment boards to connect job seek-
ers with employers, putting a dent in
our Nation’s skills gap.
If this amendment passes, an addi-
tional $3 million will be provided to the
Children and Families Services ac-
count, which will fund the research
into CRCs. We then will work with
Senate colleagues to ensure that the
funding is used for the purpose of this
groundbreaking research.
Madam Chair, Congress should sup-
port initiatives that make Federal pro-
grams more accessible for Americans
and do it in a way that saves taxpayer
money.
Community Resource Centers are a
perfect example of that, and I applaud
H.R. 2740’s recognition of that fact. I
urge the House to support my amend-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Ms. DELAURO), our distin-
guished subcommittee chair.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
to support my friend’s efforts to dem-
onstrate how the centralized Commu-
nity Resource Centers can be a cost-ef-
fective, one-stop shop for those looking
to access and apply for Federal social
service programs like SNAP, WIC, and
Medicare or for access to services like
domestic violence prevention assist-
ance.
It is an innovative approach. Part-
nerships with local governments allow
citizens to access Federal social serv-
ices in a single location, which could
reduce burdens to constituents and
allow Federal resources to flow in a
more cost-effective manner.
I urge my colleagues to support the
amendment.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I rise
hesitatingly to oppose this amend-
ment. This is not an inconsequential
amount of money. This is $3 million,
and it is taken out of the Secretary’s
office.
It is not prioritizing and saying, well,
this program is more important than
this program, so we are going to shift
funds from one program to another. It
actually strikes at the core of how the
Secretary can manage the department.
I just don’t think that is the respon-
sible way to do business. If we think
this program is important, that is fine.
Find another program that is less im-
portant. But let’s not just take it from
the Secretary’s office because the Sec-
retary has to manage a large organiza-
tion.
And, again, I know we are in Wash-
ington, but $3 million is a lot of money
to take out of an office, so I rise in op-
position to the amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Chair, I respect-
fully challenge my colleague and would
certainly invite him to go to the Com-
munity Resource Center in Mecklen-
burg County to see the work that they
do every day, to see how they stabilize
families and help reduce the need for
those seeking social services to travel
multiple times to access Federal pro-
grams.
The last thing we should be doing is
burdening working Americans by in-
creasing their costs to receive the help-
ing hand that programs like Medicaid
and SNAP provide.
Madam Chair, I would just, again,
urge support for the amendment, as
our most important job as Members of
Congress is to make the lives of Ameri-
cans better.
The CRCs do that work, and let’s do
ours and ensure that they have the re-
sources they need to continue that
progress.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, this is a
good cause. This is a good idea. But,
you know, we have $10 billion in
unspent CHIP funds sitting in a fund.
So the question is: Why take this
from the Secretary’s office? I get it.
Some people don’t like the Secretary.
Some people don’t like the administra-
tion.
But there is $10 billion sitting there
that could be spent on programs like
this, unspent CHIP funds.
So I have to oppose this amendment
because, again, let’s prioritize. This is
an important fund. Don’t take it out of
the Secretary’s office.
I get it. You don’t like the adminis-
tration. You don’t like the Secretary.
Don’t take it out of his office.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman

Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, my
amendment would allocate funds for a
feasibility study on the adoption of
geolocation for the Suicide Lifeline.
Suicide is a leading cause of death
across all groups. The Centers for Dis-
ease Control recently reported the age-
adjusted suicide rate had increased 33
percent from 1999 through 2017. In 2017,
the last year for which we have statis-
tics, 47,000 Americans took their own
life.
The Suicide Lifeline is a one-stop,
anonymous, toll-free means for any
person in the United States who is in
emotional distress, who is thinking
about killing themselves, to be con-
nected to a trained counselor for as-
sistance at anytime, anywhere in the
U.S.
The Lifeline routes calls to a net-
work of certified local crisis centers. In
northern Virginia, it will call some-
body in northern Virginia. They can
then intervene with support and link
them to the resources they need: men-
tal health, social services, sometimes
police, sometimes emergency rooms.
Last year, 2 million people used the
Lifeline, and we are tracking 2.5 mil-
lion in 2019.
What is relevant now is that 80 per-
cent of callers are using their
cellphones, not their land lines. The
Lifeline network routes the call based
on the area code. If it is a northern
Virginia area code, it is going to send
it to a northern Virginia call center.
The problem with wireless devices, as
we all know, is that people are moving
all the time and, often, their cellphone
follows them. As I call most of the
young people on my staff, I am calling
cellphone numbers in Massachusetts,
California, Texas, and Maryland.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4608 June 12, 2019
So, what we need is geolocation,
which is what we already use for the
911 calls. Geolocation means that,
when they make that call to the sui-
cide hotline, it is going to be allocated
not based on their area code but based
on where the call is actually made
from.
When you figure that 25 percent of
the callers are determined to be in im-
minent risk of suicide, that they are
thinking about it right then and now,
the counselor needs to be able to en-
gage rescue services, police, emergency
rooms; and accurate location informa-
tion makes all the difference in the
world.
This knowledge—this timely, reliable
knowledge—really can be the dif-
ference between life and death. So, im-
plementing geolocation for Lifeline
could result in crucial gains for people
in distress.
SAMHSA, the Federal agency in
charge of mental health, when they re-
ported on Representative STEWART’s
bill to modernize the Lifeline, reported
very positively on geolocation as a
piece of that.
So, what we are simply calling for is
a study, with money moved from one
program to another program, to study
this and to make sure that it works.
Suicide is now the 10th leading cause
of death in the United States and ris-
ing, so this is a very worthwhile
amendment, and we hope that it will
save many lives in the years to come.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO), the chair of the sub-
committee.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of this amendment.
The National Suicide Prevention
Lifeline provides free and confidential
emotional support to people in suicidal
crisis or emotional distress, 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week, across the country.
The Lifeline provides this essential
service through a national network of
over 150 local crisis centers, combining
custom local care and resources with
national standards and best practices.
To further support these efforts, the
bill includes an $8 million increase for
the Suicide Prevention Lifeline.
What this amendment calls for is a
feasibility study to be conducted on
how we find out where these folks are
so that we can help them. When people
reach out for help, we must do our best
to respond to them in order to be able
to reduce suicide attempts.
Suicide is devastating communities
across our country with 47,000 deaths in
2017. Depression and other mental
health conditions are a significant risk
factor for suicide. Less than half of the
people who die from suicide have a
known mental health condition.
As our bill shows, we are committed
to suicide prevention efforts. I support
the gentleman’s proposal to study ways
to improve these efforts, and I am urg-
ing my colleagues to support this
amendment.

the height of the family separation, we
couldn’t find out where the kids were
being held in Virginia. In fact, when we
did find out, we found out from the
media, from newspaper reporters and
television reporters.
I recognize the need to respect these
minors’ privacy, but there has to be an
exception for the individuals who are
in a position to help them, people on
the congressional committees that
have the oversight and the legal coun-
sel. They have got to know where they
are.
This is especially true now that we
are learning that ORR is using unli-
censed facilities like Homestead and
Carizzo Springs.
Increased transparency around the
unlicensed facilities is necessary in
order for legal advocates to effectively
monitor the conditions and to track
violations of the Flores settlement.
The legal orientation providers can’t
serve these kids if they don’t know
where they are. Neither they nor the
legal help of the kids nor the leaders in
Congress should be learning about the
shelters through the media.
The second piece of the amendment
is the monthly census broken down by
age and gender. Right now, we don’t
know whether the kids are 17 years old
or a baby or a 17-year-old with a baby.
Now, ORR is under statutory man-
date to reunite these kids as quickly as
possible, and tracking gender and age
will help tell us whether they are doing
it or not. We need to know where the
kids are and for how long they are
there.
Beyond that, that sense of duration,
we need a much more accurate count.
We don’t want to hear one number
from the agencies and a different, per-
haps more accurate, number from the
media. We just want thoughtful trans-
parency. We are dealing with kids.
I have visited a couple of these facili-
ties in Virginia. They desperately need
our help, and we need to be able to help
them, and knowing where they are will
really do that.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I claim
time in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, I yield
such time as she may consume to the
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.

Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of the gentleman’s amend-
ment.
Oversight of the Unaccompanied
Alien Children program has been and
will continue to be critical under my
watch as chair of this subcommittee.
To be fair, my good friend, Mr. COLE,
was also very supportive of our efforts
to get reporting requirements in last
year’s Labor-HHS appropriations bill
and in the end-of-year bill as well.
If there is information that we are
missing that we need in order to make
better decisions about how this pro-
gram is funded, I will work with my
friend, Mr. BEYER, to get the best infor-
mation we can from ORR.
Congress and this Appropriations
Committee will be vigilant in its over-
sight role of the Unaccompanied Alien
Children program.
And to those who will grandstand
about their concern of the fate of these
children who are in our custody, I say
the following: Where were you? Where
were your voices when children were
separated from their families at the
border?
Not only that, when you take your
clothes to the cleaners, you get a claim
check. When you check your baggage
at an airport, you get a claim check. If
you go to a restaurant and leave your
coat, you get a claim check.
This administration had no claim
check for the children they took away
from their families. And to date, there
may be youngsters who will never be
reunited with their families because of
this administration’s policy.
Where were they? Where were you?
Crying out in help for these children.
Don’t come forward now and be polit-
ical in what you are doing.
We are going to provide humani-
tarian assistance, as we have in 2019

I support the gentleman’s amend-
ment. I support the gentleman’s

PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I have a
parliamentary inquiry.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
will state his parliamentary inquiry.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, are re-
marks supposed to be directed to the
Chair?
The Acting CHAIR. Members are re-
minded to address their remarks to the
Chair.
Ms. DELAURO. I will direct them to
the Chair.
Where were they?
I support the gentleman’s amend-
ment.
Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, Mr. COLE
supports the children. He actually sup-
ports funding these programs for the
children past this month, something
the majority doesn’t. Time after time
after time, the majority has refused
the funding.
Now, Madam Chair, there is no need
for this amendment because, in 1
month, we can’t take care of any chil-
dren because the majority has refused,
time after time after time, to provide
funding to take care of these children.
And then, Madam Chair, the majority
gets up, Members of the majority get
up and claim that they are for the chil-
dren.
Sure, we need reporting. But before
we need reporting, we actually need
funding. We should bring—instead of
being here at 1:40 debating a two-line
amendment that says just decrease and
increase, we ought to be actually de-
bating a supplemental bill.
Madam Chair, I yield such time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. ROY).
Mr. ROY. Madam Chair, it is 1:35 in
the morning here on the East Coast.
I represent a district in Texas. Some-
where in Texas right now are a host of
families and children who have no
place to be put, nowhere to be put be-
cause we are not doing our job. Those
are facts.
All the theater, all the grandstanding
that is going to be pointed out here on
the floor of the House of Representa-
tives, those are the facts.
There is a child today who doesn’t
have a place to be put. We can’t just
take that child and put him or her
someplace magical. We have to have a
place to put him or her.
Today, right now, the Reynosa fac-
tion of the Gulf Cartel is making hun-
dreds of millions of dollars moving peo-
ple—not just fentanyl, not just co-
caine, not just heroin, although lots of
that, too, but moving people.
Right now, somewhere in the United
States of America, particularly prob-
ably in Houston or San Antonio, there
is a stash house with children in it and
people in it being held hostage to pay
money back to the cartels.
If you don’t believe it, go talk to the
people in the Department of Public
Safety in Texas and CBP and ICE in
Texas. Talk to them. That is what is
actually happening.
And how can we, with a straight face,
say that we are the most powerful na-
tion in the world and allow that to be
happening at our border, while our asy-
lum laws are being exploited by cartels
for profit, asylum laws which we
should have, but where people should
go to ports of entry and have a path to
come here? Instead, we allow them to
be violated by cartels for profit, and
cartels have operational control of our
border.
I literally cannot comprehend how
our colleagues on the other side of the
aisle believe it is more appropriate to
bury their heads in the sand of this
Chamber and ignore this, ignore this
problem, this real problem, where
144,000 people were apprehended in
May. HHS has taken charge of nearly
41,000 UACs this year—41,000.
In December, 4,700 unaccompanied
children were apprehended on the
southern border. In May, 11,500 unac-
companied alien minor children were
apprehended on the southern border.
These are the actual numbers. Does
that not matter?
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, if I can
inquire how much time I have remain-
ing.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland has 45 seconds remain-
ing.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I yield 45
seconds to the gentleman from South
Carolina (Mr. NORMAN).
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Chair, it is—
what?—20 till 2. We have got a group
here that is willing to stay all night
until we address this problem with the
supplemental.
You can talk about children, but,
just like my good friend from Texas
says, go to the border. See these chil-
dren who are going, who are being drug
back and forth, charged, making
money for these adults.
Let’s put the money—we don’t have
to just go to Virginia. I feel for these
children in Virginia, but I feel for those
144,000 whom they caught, much less
the ones that got by.
I further feel for the children who,
according to DHS, were saying that
they are being carted back and forth,
raped. They have rape trees. Go to the
border. Where is the compassion for
them?
It is high time for us to debate a sup-
plemental. And if it takes however long
on this clock, we are going to do it, be-
cause we are tired of it.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, may I ask
how much time I have left.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Virginia has 30 seconds remain-
ing.
Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, in 30
quick seconds, I would like to point out
there is a difference between appre-
hended and offering yourself at the bor-
der to Customs and Border Patrol for
asylum. There is an enormous dif-
ference.
I would also like to point out that
there is not a single person on this side
of the aisle who doesn’t want to bring
this humanitarian aid to the children.
We have to be able to find something
that the White House will also accept.
I am not in the room when this hap-
pens with our distinguished leaders of
appropriations, but I know they are
working very hard to make that hap-
pen.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam
Chair, I want to first thank the mem-
bers of the Appropriations Committee
for recognizing the ongoing and critical
shortage of primary care physicians
and behavioral health specialists, a
trend that is projected to continue into
the coming years, by requesting that
HRSA, the Health Resources and Serv-
ices Administration, issue a report to
Congress on how to better recruit and
train these health professionals, as
well as recommendations to address
health professional staffing shortages.
My amendment serves to underscore
the importance of the requested report
and to encourage HRSA to not just
analyze how these efforts can improve
staffing shortages in underserved
areas, but how we can increase the
number of physicians serving in com-
munity health centers located in those
areas.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4610 June 12, 2019
Delaware, like many States around
the country, is facing a severe primary
care physician shortage. In 2018, there
were just 815 primary care physicians
in Delaware, down 5.4 percent from
2013.
b 0145
According to HRSA, of the three
counties in Delaware, two of them,
Kent and Sussex, exceed the 2,000 to 1
primary-doctor-to-patient ratio, which
is a benchmark for shortages.
According to a study commissioned
by the Delaware Department of Health
and Social Services, this trend is going
to significantly impact the State’s
rural, downstate communities.
As HRSA develops recommendations
for addressing physician shortages,
they should also focus on how we can
incentivize primary care physicians, in
addition to other physicians experi-
encing health staffing shortages, to not
just practice in underserved areas, but
at community health centers.
Community health centers bring
comprehensive primary care to under-
served areas, improving not only access
to healthcare, but health outcomes.
People in my State depend on com-
munity health centers for a variety of
reasons. La Red Health Center, located
in Georgetown, Delaware, shared that
their patients appreciated their access
to primary care, behavioral health
services, and oral health care all in one
place, and that medical services fo-
cused on the full lifecycle. For some,
they face the inability to access care at
private practices.
Community health centers will con-
tinue to be a vital source of care for
underserved communities, and we
should know the best ways to attract
physicians to serve in them.
Madam Chair, I encourage my col-
leagues to support the amendment.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO), a tireless advocate and dis-
tinguished Member, the chairwoman of
the Appropriations Subcommittee on
Labor, Health and Human Services,
Education, and Related Agencies.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
Madam Chair, I rise in support of this
amendment. I share the gentlewoman’s
concern about the lack of healthcare
providers, especially in rural and un-
derserved areas across the Nation.
This bill provides an increase of $138
million for programs to support train-
ing for the next generation of
healthcare providers.
For example, the bill provides addi-
tional resources to support nurse train-
ing, including a new $20 million nurse
practitioner residency training pro-
gram. The bill increases funding for
Children’s Hospitals Graduate Medical
Education by $25 million.
The bill increases funding for Area
Health Education Centers to expand
the reach of healthcare networks and
improve healthcare delivery in rural
and underserved areas.
The bill also includes two new pro-
grams, authorized last year in the
SUPPORT Act, to support the mental
health and substance use disorder
workforce.
All of these programs focus on the
areas of practice and populations most
in need across the country.
Madam Chair, I thank the gentle-
woman for offering this amendment,
and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam
Chair, I encourage my colleagues to
support H.R. 2740 and this common-
sense amendment. It will ensure that
we have the best information available
to help all communities, both rural and
urban.

The Chair recognizes the gentle-

Mrs. MURPHY. Madam Chair, I yield
myself as much time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Chair, I rise in support of my
amendment, which I am proud to co-
lead with 25 members of the Future
Forum, a generational caucus that fo-
cuses on issues important to younger
Americans.
My amendment would provide addi-
tional support for youth suicide pre-
vention strategies in K–12 schools, col-
leges, and universities, juvenile justice
systems, and foster care systems.
My amendment would provide an ad-
ditional $2 million for the Garrett Lee
Smith Youth Suicide Prevention State
and Campus grants.
Suicide is the second leading cause of
death among youth in America. In the
past decade, approximately 22,000
Americans ages 10 to 19 have died by
suicide.
This is staggering, and we must re-
member that behind every abstract
statistic lies a shattered human life, a
brokenhearted family, and a distraught
community.
This issue hits close to home for fam-
ilies in my central Florida district
where, in recent years, we have
mourned the loss of far too many stu-
dents to suicide. Just months ago, a
student died by suicide on a school
campus. She was only 17 years old.
Last year, I held youth and mental
health advisory board meetings in my
district. My constituents told me that
there was a need for additional re-
sources on campus and in our commu-
nities to help students and young
adults treat mental health conditions
before they become serious or even life-
threatening.
That is precisely what our amend-
ment would do.
Simply put, this grant funding will
help save lives.
Madam Chair, I respectfully ask my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to
support it.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO), the chairwoman of the
House Appropriations Labor, Health
and Human Services, Education, and
Related Agencies Subcommittee.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of this amendment.
Madam Chair, we know suicide is
devastating our communities across
the country; 47,000 deaths in 2017.
The underlying bill that we are con-
sidering includes $20 million of new
funding for suicide prevention efforts
at the Centers for Disease Control and
also at the Substance Abuse and Men-
tal Health Services Administration.
This amendment increases funding
for efforts to prevent suicide among
youth at the places that many of them
can be found: colleges and universities,
youth-serving organizations.
Through training and activities
aimed at identifying youth at risk for
suicide, screenings and the connection
to appropriate services are preventing
suicides and suicide attempts.
The underlying bill that we consider
tonight shows my interest and that I
strongly support suicide prevention ef-
forts.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this effort.

leadership in our Future Forum and for
focusing on the important healthcare
issues facing our young people today.
Madam Chair, I am proud to cospon-
sor this amendment to invest in the
Garrett Lee Smith Youth Suicide Pre-
vention grants to promote outreach,
education, awareness, and prevention
efforts to young people in our commu-
nities and to vulnerable students on
our college campuses.
Suicide is the leading cause of death
among young people ages 15 to 24 in my
State of Utah, and we know that we
can do more to save lives.
We have tremendous leaders stepping
up in Utah to change the conversation
on mental health and to reach people
in crisis.
In fact, Weber State University in
Utah recently used a Garrett Lee
Smith Campus grant to fund its peer-
based support network to address men-
tal health stigma and to expand stu-
dents’ access to mental health support.
Madam Chair, I am proud to support
this amendment and to expand our
work to invest in the mental health of
our young people.
Mrs. MURPHY. Madam Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, there is
no question that suicide prevention is
important, no question in anyone’s
mind. We have an epidemic of it, but
we also have an epidemic of substance
abuse.
Here is the problem. This amendment
takes funds from health surveillance
and program support, which supple-
ment activities funded under the head-
ings mental health, substance abuse
treatment, and substance abuse pre-
vention.
So there is a problem there, because
no question suicide is important, sui-
cide prevention is important, but this
amendment is robbing Peter to pay
Paul, Madam Chair. This amendment is
taking money from substance abuse.
If we are going to set priorities, both
should be high priorities. The gentle-
woman should have found the money
somewhere else, maybe in the $10 bil-
lion that is sitting unspent in the CHIP
account, instead of taking money from
substance abuse.
Madam Chair, that is why I oppose
this amendment, and I yield back the
balance of my time.

tlewoman from Florida (Mrs. MURPHY).
The question was taken; and the Act-

The Chair recognizes the gentle-

Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Madam Chair,
I rise to offer an amendment transfer-
ring $15 million to the CDC’s Opioid-
Related Infectious Disease program.
Madam Chair, one of the deadly con-
sequences of the opioid crisis and its
related use of contaminated drug
equipment has been the increased inci-
dence of blood-borne infections, includ-
ing hepatitis, HIV, and bacteria-caused
heart infections.
The CDC’s infectious disease program
works to implement evidence-based
drug prevention in schools and commu-
nity settings.
The opioid crisis has impacted nearly
every community in the United States,
rich and poor, rural and urban, and
people of all racial and cultural identi-
ties.
In my own home borough of the
Bronx, fatal overdoses are now at their
highest rate since official data has
even been made public, and 85 percent
of those overdoses involved opioids.
In order for us to really approach and
solve this issue, we have to make sure
that we are adequately funding pro-
grams that are backed by evidence and
backed by studies and funded in a way
that reduces the load and reduces the
incidence of fatality.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, the bot-
tom line is this bill already increases
this program. With the committee re-
port, page 59, we suggest an increase of
$15 million.
The $15 million in this amendment
comes out of the Office of the Sec-
retary. Again, I don’t know how the
Secretary is going to do all the work
he has to do to take care of the entire
Department if $15 million comes out to
supplement a program that is already
being supplemented.
Madam Chair, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ROY).
b 0200
Mr. ROY. Madam Chair, I thank the
gentleman from Maryland. I appreciate
my friend from New York’s concern
about this important issue that is obvi-
ously paramount for the Nation. Every
State in the Union is touched by the
tragedy of opioid abuse.
I do want to point out, as has, I
think, been made clear by my col-
leagues and myself about our contin-
ued concern about our lack of apprecia-
tion and effort by this body to deal
with the crisis at our border, that the
impact on the opioid problem by the
trafficking going on at our southern
border is significant. I think we all
agree on that. We all recognize that.
In fact, my colleague from New York
and I have sat in Oversight hearings
where we have had witnesses there
where we talk about the massive in-
crease over the last several years in
the amount of narcotics that are com-
ing through our southern border, and
this is just something that I hope we
can have a bipartisan understanding
and agreement on about addressing and
actually dealing with the concern.
According to Border Patrol’s most
recent data, through the end of May,
they seized 144 pounds of fentanyl be-
tween ports of entry since October; 98
percent was seized on our southwest
border.
Fentanyl, in a pack of sugar, is
enough to kill everybody in this room.
It is a very dangerous narcotic—144
pounds between ports of entry.
In 2018, U.S. Border Patrol seized 388
pounds of fentanyl.
6,162 ounces of heroin have been
seized between the ports of entry in fis-
cal year 2019 alone; 444 pounds of co-
caine in May of this year between the
ports of entry. Office of Field Oper-
ations has seized 241,000 pounds of
drugs, total.
Seventy thousand Americans died
from drug overdoses in 2017, and
fentanyl played a large roll in that.
Deaths involving fentanyl increased
more than 45 percent in 2017, alone.
I could go through the stats and we
can keep talking about it, but I would
hope that, on an issue like this, where
I believe very much in the heart of my
colleague and what she is trying to ac-
complish with this amendment, that
we could come to an agreement that
the vast quantities of these narcotics,
so much of it is coming across our
southern border. In addition to, obvi-
ously, the prescription drug problems
we have had and we have been dealing
with and we are trying to deal with, we
have got to address this problem.
The cartels, literally, have oper-
ational control of our border; and the
consequences aren’t just the profit on
the back of people and children and
what we are dealing with and the in-
ability to house them, but it is in this,
in the opioid crisis that we are all try-
ing to deal with that is being supplied
so much from both China and then
through Mexico.

appropriation in health and human
services.
The opioid crisis is here, and there is
no denying that this is a crisis on our
doorstep. There are multiple levers and
multiple solutions that we can ap-
proach in order to treat the amount of
pain that is being experienced across
the country.
So with that being said, what we
really need to focus on is what those
levers are, and one of these is the fact
that infectious diseases, the rates of
hepatitis B, hepatitis C are exploding
due to the injection methods in the
opioid crisis and self-administering
opioids.
That being said, we have to address
this issue. We are not even asking for
an increased appropriation. We are ask-
ing for a transfer of funds. So it is the
same amount of funding, but we are
just transferring it to a place where it
is going to be most effective and treat
and impact more families positively.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I yield to
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY).
Mr. ROY. Madam Chair, I appreciate
that, and I would only point out in re-
sponse to my friend from New York,
and recognizing that this is an HHS-re-
lated matter, that one of the issues we
are trying to deal with with respect to
HHS is the office of ORR in dealing
with the children and dealing with the
unaccompanied children that we don’t
have anyplace to house, and we are
looking for $41⁄2 billion to deal with the
problem at our border, including deal-
ing with ORR and the children who are
being housed at HHS. That it is a very
paramount issue, and I think it is rel-
evant in this particular moment.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, there are
a lot of important issues we can discuss
on the floor. This is one of them, clear-
ly. But we should be discussing a much
larger issue, the issue of border secu-
rity and stopping the flow.
144 pounds of fentanyl seized at the
border, that could kill the entire popu-
lation of the United States. This is the
amount we seized.
It is unbelievable that Congress can’t
act to control the flow of drugs across
our southern border, because we are
playing politics with our children’s
lives now.
Madam Chair, we should bring the
supplemental bill to the floor as soon
as possible. As the gentleman from
South Carolina suggested, we are ready
to go all night. Let’s bring it to the
floor. House leadership can bring it to
the floor tonight. Let’s go ahead.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Madam Chair,
I yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tlewoman from New York (Ms. OCASIO-
CORTEZ).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.

AMENDMENT NO. 58 OFFERED BY MS. OCASIO-
CORTEZ
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 58 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Madam Chair,
I have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
On page 164, beginning on line 1, strike sec-
tion 509.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentlewoman
from New York (Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ)
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York.
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Madam Chair,
I rise today to offer this critical bipar-
tisan amendment that will allow
United States researchers to study and
examine the extraordinary promise
shown by several schedule I drugs that
have been shown in treating critical
diseases, such as MDMA’s success in
veteran PTSD, psilocybin’s promise in
treatment-resistant depression, or
ibogaine’s effectiveness in opioid and
other drug addiction. Additionally, this
will allow research into marijuana’s
impact in cancer relief, seizure treat-
ment, and more.
This amendment strikes a war-on-
drugs provision that prohibits any ac-
tivity ‘‘promoting the legalization of
any drug included in schedule I of the
Controlled Substance Act.’’ The prob-
lem with this provision is that it is so
vague and broadly interpreted that it
prevents scientists from researching,
examining, and exploring avenues of
treatment that could alleviate an enor-
mous amount of suffering from medical
conditions.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to
gentleman from California (Mr.
CORREA).
Mr. CORREA. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding.
I am proud to join my colleague from
New York (Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ) to sup-
port this life-saving amendment. We
need legitimate, reliable research by
universities and other institutions into
the health benefits of cannabis and
other substances. This amendment will
allow credible research institutions to
conduct research by removing layers of
paperwork that serve as hurdles meant
to block such research.
As more Americans, including vet-
erans, use cannabis and so-called magic
mushrooms to manage or treat their
pain or other health conditions, it is
important that doctors have the nec-
essary information on the possible ben-
efits or not of these substances.
Our brave men and women who
served in Iraq and Afghanistan re-
turned home with many wounds, many
of them invisible. Sadly, the current
use of opioids to treat PTSD and other
chronic pains has been effective and
many times has led to addiction and
even death.
I have listened to veterans both in
California and in my office here in
Washington, D.C., who have called for
additional research into cannabis. Ac-
cording to an Iraq and Afghanistan
Veterans of America survey, more than
80 percent of their membership agree
that cannabis should be legal for med-
ical purposes, while 90 percent also sup-
port medical cannabis research.
As a result, I introduced a bill to pro-
mote cannabis research, the VA Med-
ical Cannabis Research Act. My bipar-
tisan bill requires clinical research on
the safety and effectiveness of medical
cannabis in treating veterans.
Likewise, this amendment will re-
duce barriers to research on cannabis
and psychedelics. Since Denver and
Oakland have decriminalized the use of
certain psychedelics, this amendment
is both timely and very necessary.
I urge my colleagues to pass this
amendment.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, the bot-
tom line is this is not the place and
this won’t do what the offer in support
of the amendment says it is going to
do, because the fact of the matter is
that the DEA is the one that enforced
the classification of schedule I. This
bill has nothing to do with the DEA.
In fact, the problem with research
and the problem with the difficulty in
doing research does not lie in HHS. The
problem lies in the fact that it is a
schedule I drug, and the appropriate
way to deal with this is through an au-
thorizing committee, as the gentleman
from California suggests, with legisla-
tion that would allow more research,
as has been suggested.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
PERRY).
Mr. PERRY. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentleman from Maryland, and I
just wonder about the responsibility of
this legislation. To have the govern-
ment promote these items that are on
the schedule, things like MDMA, the
pure form of Molly and meth, is that
what we want? We want the Federal
Government telling our families and
our children: ‘‘Take this. It is good for
you’’?
Maybe it is, but I sure don’t think it
is. I certainly don’t want my kids tak-
ing it, and I certainly don’t want the
government promoting it.
Essentially, my whole life was smok-
ing cessation of tobacco. Now we are fi-
nally at a place where we have reduced
that dramatically, and now we are
going to tell the whole rest of the
country, well, let’s all start smoking
marijuana instead.

June 12, 2019
I don’t think this is what the govern-
ment should be promoting, and I think
we should have a lot more research be-
fore we tell our kids that this is what
they should be doing.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
PERRY), who is absolutely right. We do
need more research. But the current re-
striction that is struck, section 509,
says that this limitation shall not
apply where there is significant med-
ical evidence of therapeutic advantage
or that federally sponsored clinical
trials are being conducted.
Well, that is what we need. We need
federally sponsored clinical trials. The
current section 509 does not stop this.
Now, look, I get it. There are people
who want the legalization of mari-
juana. I get it. But as a physician, I
will tell you I urge the people who sug-
gest that there are broad
applicabilities that are proven medical
uses of marijuana to go back to the
Journal of the American Medical Asso-
ciation, which did a review last year
that indicated that, of the over 50 sug-
gested uses for medical marijuana,
only 4 are proven through rigorous sci-
entific trials—4, Madam Chair.
PTSD is not one of them. It is not.
Treatment for opioid abuse is not one
of them.
In fact, Dr. Nora Volkow, the head of
the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
who I think knows probably more than
anyone in this room about the subject,
says that marijuana is an addictive
drug that is dangerous, and recent re-
search says that induces psychosis in
young people, serious major psychotic
conditions.
And we want to remove all the re-
strictions in the health part of the law?
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Madam Chair,
my colleague across the aisle said we
need to research this more, and I agree,
and that is why this amendment is
being introduced.
The note was brought up that there
is a rider provision saying that there is
an exception for those drugs that have
shown medical promise, but we cannot
prove that medical promise unless we
fund the research to actually have it in
the first place.
So we have a catch-22, and we have to
get rid of it.
There are war-on-drugs provisions in
so many Federal statutes beyond just
the one schedule, the one scheduling of
these drugs.
I am a strong believer in evidence-
based policymaking, and wherever
there is evidence of good, we have a
moral obligation to pursue and explore
the parameters of that good, even if it
means challenging our past assump-
tions or admitting past wrongs.
Thirty percent of all military vet-
erans have considered suicide—30 per-
cent. So if a substance shows promise
in treating PTSD, we have an obliga-
tion to study it.
One of the leading causes of death in
America today is suicide. So if a sched-
ule I drug shows clinical promise in
treating and in treatment-resistant de-
pression, perhaps it is not the drug we
should say is morally wrong, but per-
haps it is the law, the schedule, the
statute.
b 0215
Moreover, I am proud to say that this
is a bipartisan amendment. My col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle
often bemoan the role of government
and promote ideas of choice. Here, in
that spirit, I am happy to agree, to say
we should get government and political
opinion out of scientific research that
we have seen and has shown promise in
any way that can help people and their
medical needs.
Lastly, I understand that the politics
of this bill may make it difficult for
some to support right now. But I pro-
pose this amendment, and I urge my
colleagues to support it, because poli-
tics isn’t always about winning today.
It is about fighting for what is right in
the future and for future generations.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, may I in-
quire how much time I have remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland has 2 minutes remain-
ing.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, the bot-
tom line is that there is scientific evi-
dence about the danger of marijuana.
It is largely unstudied, and anyone,
Madam Chair, who understands how re-
search is conducted here should realize
that the roadblock is not in HHS. It is
not in the jurisdiction of this bill. It is
with the DEA. This does nothing to re-
move the scheduling with regard to
how the DEA views marijuana.
Dr. Volkow, one of the world’s ex-
perts on addiction, it was brought up
that maybe we can treat addiction
with marijuana, and she says abso-
lutely not. This drug causes addiction.
One-seventh of the people who are ad-
dicted to opioids started with mari-
juana. It is a gateway drug. It is dan-
gerous.
This amendment does nothing to deal
with promoting research because the
problem is not in HHS. The problem is
in DEA.
Madam Chair, I have tried to deal
with this problem. I have cosponsored a
bill that promotes research with a
broader approach, to involve all the
Federal agencies that could hinder re-
search in any way. This amendment
does nothing to do that. This sends a
bad signal.
As the gentleman from Pennsylvania
suggested, this isn’t about marijuana,
it is about every schedule I drug, and
there are very dangerous schedule I
drugs.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tlewoman from New York (Ms. OCASIO-

Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, I rise to offer my
amendment to strengthen our national
efforts to address the public health cri-
sis of suicide in our country.
I would like to applaud Chairwoman
LOWEY and Ranking Member GRANGER
for their work on this bill, as well as
my colleague from Utah on the com-
mittee, Representative STEWART, who
has been a champion of suicide preven-
tion efforts in Congress.
For the first time, this legislation
specifically provides funding for re-
search, outreach, and prevention meas-
ures on the concerning public health
issue of suicide through the Centers for
Disease Control’s Injury Prevention
and Control programs. My amendment
would build on this work by providing
additional capacity at the CDC to en-
sure the agency can enhance its out-
reach and prevention work for youth at
risk of suicide.
My home State of Utah is grappling
with a suicide crisis. From seniors ex-
periencing isolation in rural commu-
nities to young people who face bul-
lying in schools, we are seeing rates of
suicide rise across multiple popu-
lations. In fact, one high school in my
district recently lost seven students to
suicide in only 1 year.
Utah has the unfortunate distinction
of being the State with the sixth high-
est rate of deaths by suicide, and sui-
cide is the leading cause of death of
Utahns 15 to 24 years old.
According to the CDC, between 1999
and 2016, per capita deaths by suicide
rose 46.5 percent in Utah, well above
the concerning national increase of 25.4
percent over the same period. Our
youth suicide rate more than doubled
between 2011 and 2015.
We have a bipartisan agreement in
our State that we need to do more to
understand and address this crisis. I
thank our State Governor, Governor

Herbert, for convening a youth suicide
task force to lead this effort, and the
public and community leaders who
have been working on a number of ini-
tiatives. School leaders have been
working to hire more mental health
professionals and to offer services to
help students in crisis. Our conversa-
tion in Utah on mental health wellness
has continued to evolve and bring a
focus to the health needs of vulnerable
people.
From suicide prevention lifelines, in-
cluding those for at-risk populations
like veterans, to mental health crisis
training for first responders and care
providers, we know we still need to in-
vest in the services and infrastructure
that serve people in crisis.
Policymakers must continue to re-
view how we are working to strengthen
our public health education on suicide
prevention and ensure that people with
mental health and behavioral health
needs can access affordable, quality
care.
I believe my amendment takes a
strong step to ensuring our national
and State public health experts have
sufficient resources to investigate this
troubling rise in deaths by suicide, par-
ticularly among young people, and to
develop and implement prevention
strategies.
I look forward to continuing this
work with my colleagues on the Appro-
priations Committee.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO).
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of this amendment.
We established over and over again
this evening how suicide is devastating
our communities across this country.
While depression and other mental
health conditions are a significant risk
factor for suicide, less than half of the
people who die from suicide have a
known mental health condition.
The underlying bill that we are con-
sidering tonight includes $10 million
for a new effort at the CDC to explore
the leading mechanisms of suicide
deaths and identify prevention strate-
gies to reduce deaths by suicide. This
amendment increases the funding for
this effort by $2 million to specifically
focus on youth suicide awareness, re-
search, and prevention efforts.
I am committed to suicide preven-
tion, and I appreciate the gentleman’s
support for the efforts that are focused
on our youth.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment.
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, again,
there is no question that everyone
knows that we are in a suicide epi-
demic. We have to do whatever we can,
whatever is within our powers—work
with our States, work within our local
jurisdictions, work with our commu-
nity agencies—to deal with this hor-
rible epidemic that we are having.
My problem with and my opposition
to the amendment is not the fact that
we need to pay attention to suicide
prevention. It is from where we get the
funds.
We take the funds from that, I guess,
bottomless piggybank some people
think is the Secretary’s office. In the
short time we have had since the last
vote series, we will have taken $20 mil-
lion from the Secretary’s office if all
those amendments pass on final vote.
Madam Chair, we increased the Sec-
retary’s office by 1 percent in the un-
derlying budget, so we increased it less
than inflation.
Again, the job of HHS is growing, not
shrinking. We increased it only 1 per-
cent. With this amendment, just since
the time of the last vote series, we will
have decreased the budget by 5 percent
in that office.
That is not responsible. That implies
that the committee didn’t do good
work in setting how much the Sec-
retary’s office needs to administer a
huge government agency, a very impor-
tant government agency, one that, in
fact, runs suicide prevention programs
and drug addiction programs.
Madam Chair, we have to set prior-
ities. It is nice to say we have suicide
prevention, but let’s find the pro-
gram—we didn’t take it from a pro-
gram. This amendment doesn’t take it
from a program. This amendment
takes it from something that is not a
limitless reserve: the Office of the Sec-
retary.
That is why I believe we should op-
pose this amendment.
Madam Chair, we should expect that
Members who want to prioritize pro-
grams find other programs that have a
lower priority and shift those funds.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
On page 109, line 23, after ‘‘medical goods
and services,’’, insert ‘‘which may include
early childhood developmental screenings,’’
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentlewoman
from Washington (Ms. SCHRIER) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Washington.
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, my amendment would
ensure that early childhood develop-
mental screenings are considered a
medical service and, therefore, can be
provided to children at the border who
are in the care of the Office of Refugee
Resettlement. These screenings would
be performed by volunteer medical pro-
fessionals at no cost to the taxpayer or
to the child.
There are already, thankfully, provi-
sions for pediatric-focused medical
care. That is critical given that six
children have died while in the care of
the Office of Refugee Resettlement.
This amendment goes further,
though, and makes sure that the devel-
opmental, social, and emotional health
of the children is also evaluated. Devel-
opmental screening is a standard part
of pediatric care and will diagnose
things like hearing loss, autism, lan-
guage delays, and even developmental
regression that is associated with toxic
stress.
Given the conditions under which
these children are living right now,
often without their parents and with-
out age-appropriate activities to bol-
ster their cognitive development, this
type of screening with appropriate fol-
low-up and care is critical.
Early intervention is paramount. Al-
lowing medical professionals to volun-
teer their time and expertise to screen
babies and young children for physical
problems and developmental delays is a
way to make sure that children do not
fall behind during these critical forma-
tive years and that they are set up for
success in their school years and be-
yond.
This amendment simply clarifies
that if Americans are willing to donate
medical services to children at the bor-
der, those may include developmental
and behavioral assessments.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I claim

ment, even though I support the

amendment perfects the bipartisan
provision that was included in last
year’s Labor-HHS bill, which allowed
the Department to accept donations to
assist in providing basic medical care
and support for children in the Office of
Refugee Resettlement’s care. I believe
it was an amendment by our colleague
Representative CUELLAR of Texas.
The Congresswoman’s proposal to in-
clude early childhood developmental
screenings is a great one for those gen-
erous volunteers who want to help
these children while they are in ORR’s
care.
I also want to emphasize that we will
not allow HHS or its grantees to abdi-
cate any of their responsibilities to
meet the standards that are set in law
to care for these children. On numerous
occasions, we, in fact, found, that the
care was less than what was required
by the agreement struck in 1997.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentlewoman has expired.
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Chair, I yield
an additional 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Connecticut.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I
strongly support the efforts of local
groups to provide comfort to those suf-
fering, and I commend the Congress-
woman for her amendment.
I might also add, for those who are
speaking loudly about their support for
children at the border, my colleague on
the other side of the aisle voted ‘‘no’’
on the FY appropriations Labor-HHS
bill, which provided $1.3 billion for
dealing with the children at the border.
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Chair, I am
prepared to close, if my colleague has
no further comments.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, we are
going to need a lot of volunteers, actu-
ally, in a month because the majority,
time and time and time again, has
voted against taking care of these chil-
dren when money runs out this month.
That is a fact. Yes, we will need volun-
teers. We need volunteers to do more
than the mental health, which is very
important.
When you talk about toxic stress,
wait until a child comes to the border
and we can’t provide medical services.
And we can’t provide services because
the majority in the House refuses to
bring a supplemental appropriation to
the floor.
Now, the gentlewoman commented
on someone—I don’t know, maybe it
was me—voting against a bill that has
$1.3 billion, that spends tens of billions
of dollars above the statutory Budget
Control Act numbers, and yet the ma-
jority voted in committee this week to
provide billions of dollars of funds to
take care of children at the border.
They leave that inconvenient fact out.

der of Texas, they don’t know where to
put her; they don’t have a bed for her.
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity has made this request. They have
said they are out of money. They are
out of resources. Some little girl who
has probably been brought by some
trafficker, who has been told to keep
her mouth shut or else, has nowhere to
be.
We are in here talking about reports
and everything but providing the re-
sources—not that the President has
asked for. I mean, I am sure the Presi-
dent has, at the behest of his Secretary
who knows, who is operationally on the
ground, who sees the problems as they
occur.
And because we certainly can’t have
President Trump have a victory, some
poor little girl is crying in a corner
somewhere because she has been
dragged across the border by some traf-
ficker.
We don’t even do the biometric test
that is required by law. We don’t even
know, we can’t prove that she is with
her family.
The adult says: You tell them that I
am your father. You tell them I am
your brother or uncle. You tell them,
or else.
And what do we do? We just accept
it. We accept this trafficker’s word for
it that this little girl belongs with him.
It is unacceptable.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
PERRY).
The fact of the matter is that the
majority, last year, when they were in
the minority, voted along party lines
to not provide funds to take care of
children in the Labor-HHS bill in com-
mittee. Every single member voted
against it in committee, of the now-
majority, then-minority. So I guess
what is good for the goose is not good
for the gander.
But we did take votes this year on a
motion to recommit, on an amendment
in committee this week, and a major-
ity of the majority voted to not fund
care for the children. That is where we
are going to run out of money.
The President, to his credit, has
asked and said: Please send money.
Please send money to fund the care for
these children and to stop the flow of
drugs across the border.
Madam Chair, 144 pounds of fentanyl.
We have to stop that.
Yes, certainly, it is important to do
these screenings, and I thank the gen-
tlewoman for offering the amendment,
but we have got to go much further
than that.
And again, Madam Chair, it is still
early in the morning. We are ready.
Bring the supplemental bill to the
floor.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Chair, for
somebody who agrees with my amend-
ment, that was a lot of commentary
about our situation at the border.
I am not here to discuss our situation
at the border or how we treat refugees.
I am not here to discuss the fact that
families can be with sponsors in the
United States and not in detention cen-
ters.
I am merely here to discuss my
amendment, which is that I would like
children to have appropriate medical
care and developmental screenings.
Madam Chair, I am so glad to have
the agreement from my colleague. I
yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

Madam Chairwoman, our amendment
would provide an increase in funds for
graduate medical education.
Just today, the Commonwealth Fund
rated my home State of Nevada as the
48th State, overall, for healthcare per-
formance. We trail the vast majority of
States in access, affordability, and use
of preventive care. Preventable hos-
pitalizations are up, and adults with a
regular doctor are down.
Our amendment would invest in grad-
uate medical education slots, expand-
ing access for Nevadans to get a pri-
mary care doctor or family physician.
I am grateful for the help of Chair-
woman DELAURO on this amendment,
as well as Congresswoman PORTER for
cosponsoring it with me.
Madam Chair, I urge all of my col-

H4616 June 12, 2019
There was no objection.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Chair-
woman, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO).
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
I rise in support of this amendment.
Our country is facing medical pro-
vider shortages in many critical fields
of care, including primary care. These
shortages have a disproportionate im-
pact in communities of color and in
rural areas.
The bill includes an increase of $138
million to support the Health Re-
sources and Services Administration’s
health workforce programs, which are
designed to fill gaps in the supply of
health professionals in the areas with
the most need. These programs prepare
the next generation of healthcare pro-
viders with the goal of improving ac-
cess to and quality of care.
The gentlewoman’s amendment will
build further on these efforts, and I
urge my colleagues to support this
amendment.
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Chair, I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, graduate
medical education is absolutely a prob-
lem; there is no question about it. The
demographics are clear in the United
States.
We have an aging population that re-
quires more services, and yet we don’t
have enough graduate medical edu-
cation to train all the physicians and
providers that we need to train.
Here is the problem with the amend-
ment: It goes to one of those bottom-
less wells, I guess. And not only does it
go to a bottomless well in the depart-
ment that the money is spent in, it
goes to a bottomless well in another
department.
Again, there is $10 billion in CHIP’s
funds unspent, could have come from,
but, no, the money is taken from the
Secretary of Education’s departmental
management fund.
Now, let’s review the budget of the
Department of Education, because the
budget is increased by 5 percent under
the bill passed out by the majority
from the House, from the committee.
So get it. The Department of Edu-
cation increased in size by 5 percent,
and the bill itself level-funds the De-
partment—management, not Depart-
ment, but the management.
So we are already asking the man-
agement to basically do 5 percent more
work for the same amount of money,
and here comes along this amendment,
again, no question we need more grad-
uate medical education. Again, it is a
question of priorities. If we need grad-
uate medical education, let’s find
something in HHS that we don’t need
much of, and let’s transfer that money.
But, no, that is not the approach
taken here. It is magic. We want magic
to happen.
We want the Department of Edu-
cation to do all the wonderful things
that we pay for in this budget, and we
want them to do it with level funding,
even though the budget goes up 5 per-
cent. And, now, this amendment takes
1 percent—that is significant, 1 per-
cent—because this is not the only
amendment that has gone after that
pot of money. The bottom line is it cre-
ates more mouths to feed.
This doesn’t end well because, next
year, this now becomes the baseline
and the Department—I don’t know
what they are going to do in conference
because, if all these amendments are
passed, the Department can’t run on
that money. They can’t. You can’t
manage it.
Who are we going to fire? Are we
going to fire 5 percent of the people, 10
percent of the people expecting to do
the same work?
This ain’t the way to run anything,
much less the Government of the
United States.
Madam Chair, I applaud the author of
the amendment for the idea, but for
heaven’s sake, we need fiscal sanity.
We have a $22 trillion debt, a $1 trillion
deficit. We spend over $100 billion more
than the statutory authority in these
appropriations bills. We have got to
exert fiscal discipline at some point.
Madam Chair, I reluctantly oppose
the amendment, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Chair, I
again thank Chairwoman DELAURO for

The text of the amendment is as fol-

Page 48, line 1, after the dollar amount, in-

Page 90, line 6, after the first dollar

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentlewoman
from Minnesota (Mrs. CRAIG) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Minnesota.
Mrs. CRAIG. Madam Chair, every
Minnesotan deserves access to high-
quality healthcare no matter where
they live. However, too many of my
neighbors face difficulty traveling long
distances to the nearest hospital or
even finding a nearby pharmacy. On
top of that, prescription drug prices are
skyrocketing and putting lifesaving
medications out of reach for too many
families.
These critical issues—access to
healthcare and the price of prescription
drugs—are the top issues I hear about
in my district. Therefore, my amend-
ment would take a step toward ad-
dressing these issues by giving the
Health Resources and Services Admin-
istration’s, or HRSA, Federal Office of
Rural Health Policy an additional $1
million to prioritize its coordination
with the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture to establish its rural health li-
aison.
This amendment builds on report
language in the underlying bill that en-
courages HRSA to coordinate with the
U.S. Department of Agriculture to en-
sure communities have access to the
full suite of Federal resources and that
those resources are used effectively for
health outcomes.
Madam Chair, for a bit of additional
background, Representative CHERI
BUSTOS and Senator TINA SMITH of
Minnesota, their bipartisan Rural
Health Liaison Act of 2018 was ulti-
mately included in the 2018 farm bill
and established this rural health liai-
son position.
b 0245
The liaison position at USDA will be
responsible for working with the U.S.
Department of Health and Human
Services to better coordinate rural
health resources across Federal agen-
cies. This new program is critical to
rural areas, which have historically
lacked access to adequate healthcare,
and this disparity is getting worse.
It is vital that we move forward to
close these gaps and address the rural
shortage of hospitals, medical profes-
sionals, mental health services, and
other healthcare resources to ensure
that every family can access the
healthcare that they need.
Madam Chairwoman, as a Member of
the House Agriculture Committee, I
have made it a priority to partner with
rural communities to improve access
to healthcare, broadband, housing, and
quality of life for those who live there.
This amendment is part of that com-
mitment.
Our fight for more affordable, acces-
sible healthcare must include rural
America if we are going to truly ad-
dress this critical issue. When our rural
communities are healthy, all of our
communities are healthy.
Madam Chairwoman, I yield to the
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO), the chairwoman of the
House Appropriations Subcommittee
on Labor, Health and Human Services,
Education, and Related Agencies.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chairwoman,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4617
June 12, 2019
I just want to commend the gentle-
woman for her commitment and dedi-
cation to rural America and to her
community.
The success of HHS programs to ad-
dress rural health is enhanced when
programs coordinate with other agen-
cies that have a related mission. The
committee report encourages the
Health Resources and Services Admin-
istration, to coordinate—HRSA is a
part of Health and Human Services—to
coordinate with the U.S. Department
of Agriculture and its forthcoming
rural health liaison, which has been de-
termined by the farm bill, to ensure
communities have access to the spec-
trum of Federal resources available to
them, to ensure that these resources
are managed effectively and effi-
ciently, and that people who are living
in rural communities are not isolated
and without the services they need for
themselves and for their families,
whether it be health, or whether it be
broadband, whether it be a variety of
other areas, to allow people to be able
to have a good quality of life in some of
the most remote areas.
I thank the gentlewoman for offering
this amendment and I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’
Mrs. CRAIG. Madam Chairwoman, I
urge my colleagues as well to support
this commonsense amendment, and I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chairwoman, I
rise in opposition to the amendment,
even though I agree with the idea be-
hind the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Maryland is
recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chairwoman,
there is no question that the rural
areas in this country frequently get
shortchanged. I know because I rep-
resent a rural area. That is why I was
surprised because we just heard a lot of
lip service to doing great things for the
rural areas, but, in fact, rural health is
level funded in this bill before us.
The Department spending is $10 bil-
lion higher and nothing, no increase
could go to the rural areas. And now,
all of a sudden, we are all fans of rural
areas. On the other side of the aisle I
guess we are all fans of rural areas.
We do need this extra $1 million.
Here is the problem. It didn’t identify
another program to take the money
from. It went to the believably bottom-
less well of department management,
the Office of the Secretary, which now
is up to $21 million in being raided just
since the last vote series.
I don’t know. I don’t think you need
an accounting degree to figure out that
that doesn’t work. We are asking the
Department to do more with much less
money. And, again, we do these rural
health programs. No question. But I
wish that rural health programs had
gotten a proportionate increase in the
base bill that we are talking about, but
they didn’t.
Now, I will tell the gentlewoman
about one problem that is very ramp-
ant in my rural areas and across the
country. If most people were asked:
Where is the opioid crisis worse, urban
or rural areas? We know what they will
respond, but the data shows that it is
rural areas. They have a worse prob-
lem. And, yet, it is now 2:50 in the
morning and we still haven’t seen the
supplemental bill that would help stop
the flow of illegal drugs across our
southern border.
If we really care for our rural areas,
we would ask the leadership to now
bring the bill. We can have it here in a
half hour. Let’s spend all night. Let’s
protect our rural areas. There was 144
pounds of fentanyl seized. When are we
going to be tired about fentanyl cross-
ing our borders and killing our rural
citizens?
When are we going to stop proving a
political point and dealing with the
problem? We have been promised we
are going to fast-track this. Madam
Chairwoman, the President suggested
this amount a month ago. No wonder
America has an opinion of Congress of
9 percent, because the President identi-
fied a problem a month ago and said:
We are going to run out of money to
take care of children and to secure our
border, and Congress does nothing.
We want to help our rural areas. This
is not the way to do it. Let’s stop the
flow of illegal drugs across our south-
ern borders. Let’s stop playing politics
with the lives of our youth in rural
areas by allowing that flow of drugs
across the border.
Madam Chairwoman, bring the sup-
plemental bill to the floor tonight. I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mrs. CRAIG. May I inquire how much
time I have remaining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Minnesota has 30 seconds remain-
ing.
Mrs. CRAIG. Madam Chairwoman, I
would like to point out that I, too, am
concerned about $22 trillion in deficits.
But I can tell you, the rural people in
my district, they are very concerned
about the $1 trillion tax bill that was a
giveaway to the top 5 percent and large
corporations in this country.
I grew up in a mobile home park, and
that was the last time we tried trickle-
down economics in this country, and
nothing trickled down to my family.
So I will tell the gentleman this: If he
wants to find $21 million since we have
been here tonight, let’s take a look at
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and have
real middle-class tax reform.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Mrs. CRAIG. Madam Chairwoman, as
a mother of four sons, the wife of an
educator, and the daughter of a teach-
er, I know that we should never under-
estimate the power of a high-quality
education, and we need the Federal
Government to be a strong partner in
this effort.
That starts by fully funding special
education. Unfortunately, for far too
long, the Federal Government has not
lived up to its commitment to fully
fund special ed. Under the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act, or
IDEA, the Federal Government is re-
quired to fund special education up to
40 percent per pupil. Special education
programs in Minnesota currently re-
ceive as little as 8 percent.
My amendment, which I am incred-
ibly proud to introduce today with my
Minnesota colleague, Representative
PETE STAUBER, stresses the importance
of IDEA grants to States to address
funding gaps in special education pro-
grams.
These grants are given to each State
to ensure that adequate resources are
being devoted to special education pro-
grams.
As the mother of a son with learning
challenges, I am proud to fight for our
children and our communities. I want
to thank the Appropriations Com-
mittee for working on this issue, and I
applaud their work in increasing fund-
ing for IDEA.
This bill provides over $14 billion for
special education, an increase of $1 bil-
lion over the 2019 enacted level. This is
a great start toward that 40 percent.
Special education should be a critical
piece of any conversation surrounding
education because for too long, we
haven’t given it the attention or the
resources it deserves.
I am listening to my district. My dis-
trict wants the Federal Government to
send its tax dollars back to Eagan, and
Apple Valley, and South Saint Paul,
and West Saint Paul, and all of the
places where we can do what we need
to do for our kids.
This isn’t just about special edu-
cation children. It has a ripple effect.
When we fail to fund special ed pro-
grams, that money is taken from other

budgets in our schools to make up the
difference, and all students end up at a
disadvantage.
Every student deserves access to a
quality education no matter how they
learn. Our public schools give kids the
skills they need to become future lead-
ers in our communities and earn a good
life for their families. Special edu-
cation can make all of the difference in
a student’s life and in a family’s life,
and we must take action to ensure we
are properly supporting these students.
Madam Chairwoman, I yield 1 minute
to the gentlewoman from Connecticut
(Ms. DELAURO), chairwoman of the
House Appropriations Subcommittee
on Labor, Health and Human Services,
Education, and Related Agencies.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chairwoman,
I rise in support of this bipartisan
amendment in grants to States under
the Individuals with Disabilities Edu-
cation Act, IDEA.
My colleague is right that the Fed-
eral Government has never met its
commitment to special education,
which is why the underlying bill in-
cludes $13.4 billion for IDEA Grants to
States, a $1 billion increase over fiscal
year 2019.
This increase reflects the largest in-
crease to the program in more than a
decade. I am deeply concerned that the
Federal share of the excess cost of edu-
cating students with disabilities has
declined in recent years and intend for
this historic investment to play a crit-
ical role in helping to reverse that
trend.
I appreciate that the amendment
draws attention to this important pro-
gram. I am happy to support it, and I
urge my colleagues to support it.

Mrs. CRAIG. Madam Chair, education
is at the core of our communities, but
for too long, students have been told
that traditional, 4-year degrees are
their only option for finding good-pay-
ing jobs.
In reality, we have a major skills gap
in Minnesota. We are unable to find
skilled workers for the jobs that exist.
I have one son in high school, two in
traditional 4-year colleges, and my last
son, Josh, just graduated from a career
training program. He is my son with
multiple job offers.
Career and technical education needs
to be a critical investment in order to
connect workers with the right train-
ing to help keep our economy strong.
My amendment stresses the impor-
tance of Perkins funding in adult edu-
cation to ensure that we are devoting
adequate resources to job training pro-
grams. Expanding access to grants for
career and technical education, includ-
ing apprenticeships, is critical.
Minnesota’s economy depends on
bright, talented young people, and we
need to make sure that they have the
skills they need to succeed. That starts
with taking a new approach to postsec-
ondary education and training and ex-
panding career and technical education
opportunities.
Everyone should be able to get the
skills and training that they need to
find a good-paying job. To make this a
reality, we need to take a fresh look at
our job market, our education system,
and the way we prepare students for
the workforce. That starts by investing
in these programs and helping our
young people see 2-year degrees as part
of their career path.
We have to change the way we think
about postsecondary education in this
country. We have to look at the econ-
omy in education, and a critical piece
is investing in career skills and tech-
nical education.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO).
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of this amendment.
The career and technical education
program helps ensure that high school
and community college students are
well-prepared for further education and
employment in high-skill and high-de-
mand jobs in the 21st-century econ-
omy.
Research by the conservative Amer-
ican Enterprise Institute found that
students who take career and technical
education credits in high school were
more likely to be employed full time a
decade later than those who did not.
The adult basic literacy education
program provides education and lit-
eracy assistance to low-skilled Ameri-
cans, enabling them to acquire
foundational reading, math, and
English skills as well as career readi-
ness skills for employment or transi-
tion to advanced postsecondary edu-
cation. That is why the Labor-HHS bill
provides an increase of $77 million for
CTE and adult education, for a total of
$2 billion, to further support the work
that these critical programs do.
Today, 70 percent of the people in the
United States do not have a 4-year lib-
eral arts college degree. We need to
make sure that this 70 percent has the
opportunity to realize their dreams and

cational opportunities that will give

rity for their futures.
I appreciate that the amendment
draws attention to these important
issues, and I am happy to support it.
Mrs. CRAIG. Madam Chair, I reserve

Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I rise in
opposition, even though I support the
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Maryland is
recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, there is
no question that we have shortchanged
career and technical education over the
last few years because, to be honest,
the last administration had a very dif-
ferent attitude about the needs of high-
er education. Thank goodness this Sec-
retary and this administration have
said career and technical education is
important.
It is an important part of our econ-
omy, and we find that those individuals
who have career and technical edu-
cation in those sectors of the economy
that are vibrant do have multiple job
offers. They have very lucrative job of-
fers.
On the other hand, some of the indi-
viduals who go to a traditional college
leave with liberal arts degrees and
leave with huge debts and very limited
opportunities for employment.
We have to rebalance that. I applaud
the gentlewoman from Minnesota for
emphasizing the importance because
this is long, long overdue.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mrs. CRAIG. Madam Chair, I urge my
colleagues to support this amendment,

AMENDMENT NO. 65 OFFERED BY MS. PORTER
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 65 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Ms. PORTER. Madam Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 75, line 4, after the dollar amount, in-
sert ‘‘(increased by $2,000,000)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. PORTER) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
Ms. PORTER. Madam Chair, I rise to
offer an amendment to the fiscal year
2020 appropriations bill that would in-
crease funding for the Senior Medicare
Patrol program.
Every year, we lose more than $60
billion to fraud and abuse in Medicare.
Money lost to fraud means fewer dol-
lars available for needed services and a
decreased quality of care for all.
Senior Medicare Patrol supports both
Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries by
helping them to detect and report
healthcare fraud. Each year, this pro-
gram helps both seniors and the Fed-
eral Government recover or avoid los-
ing billions of dollars.
I am proud to say that California’s
Senior Medicare Patrol program is
based in my district and in my home-
town of Irvine. The program is admin-
istered there by California Health Ad-
vocates.
CHA recently received its perform-
ance measure numbers from the Office
of the Inspector General for 2018.
Through the program, it reached
200,000 California beneficiaries, fami-
lies, and caregivers with fraud preven-
tion messages; hosted nearly 3,000 out-
reach events; and recruited over 600
volunteers across the State to fight for
seniors and families.
I thank those 600 volunteers in Cali-
fornia and more than 5,000 across the
country, many of whom are retired and
are on Medicare themselves, for their
tireless efforts.
Last year, the Office of the Inspector
General of HHS investigated a case in
Los Angeles in which a doctor and a re-
cruiter were found guilty for their
roles in frequently billing Medicare for
clinic, hospice services, and durable
medical equipment that patients either
didn’t need or didn’t receive. This fraud
cost Medicare and patients $33 million.
Senior Medicare Patrol helps stop
fraudulent actors, saving the system
money.
Rising as well are lab schemes in
which labs are offering cancer screens
using genetic testing, but really, these
labs are collecting Medicare numbers
for potential medical identity theft or
billing Medicare for expensive genetic
tests that no one needs. These costs are
passed on to Medicare, taxpayers, or to
the patients themselves.
Recently, California Health Advo-
cates issued an alert in nine languages
about these fraudulent tests. Because
of this alert, senior centers that have
been approached by those executing
these schemes have shut them out,
armed with the knowledge they need to
protect their patients from fraud.
I am proud to be here today to ensure
that this program receives the funding
it needs. As a consumer protection ad-
vocate, keeping seniors and taxpayers
safe from fraud is a top priority.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO).
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of Congresswoman PORTER’s
amendment.
It increases funding for the Senior
Medicare Patrol program by $2 million.
It provides important outreach, coun-
seling, and education to Medicare bene-
ficiaries, their families, and caregivers
to detect and report fraud, a critical
program. It protects seniors as well as
taxpayers from criminal fraud, reaches
nearly 2 million beneficiaries per year,
and returns millions of dollars in sav-
ings to the Treasury.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment.
Ms. PORTER. Madam Chair, I thank
the chairwoman for her remarks, and I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR (Mrs. CRAIG). The
gentleman from Maryland is recog-
nized for 5 minutes.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, the idea
is okay. This is all part of the puzzle.
The Senior Medicare Patrol is a part of
the puzzle.
But, again, my problem with this
amendment is not that this program
doesn’t have some value. It is from
where it takes the money. It makes the
judgment that the other things in that
pot of fraud control—because that is
the pot it comes out of. It doesn’t say
that this fraud control program is so
important that we are going to look
into some other part of HHS to take
those dollars. It says that the other
parts of fraud control are not as impor-
tant.
Madam Chair, part of this money
goes, for instance, to Department of
Justice special attorneys who actually
have to prosecute the cases. It is nice
to find fraud, but if we don’t have
money to prosecute the cases, then we
have a problem.
Again, this is the wishful thinking
that we can just create all kinds of pro-
grams and that it doesn’t make a dif-
ference where the money comes from.
But it does because this $2 million
comes out of some other fraud control
somewhere. That is my concern.
I don’t know that we have the knowl-
edge to know that this fraud control
actually yields more in terms of catch-
ing fraud and getting fraud moneys
back than other uses of this account.
That is why, again, I applaud the
idea. Let’s train everybody to look. We
know that fraud in Medicare and Med-
icaid is huge. The American taxpayer
deserves to catch all the fraud. I am
just not sure this is the best way to
spend our fraud dollars. This account
has already been plussed-up in the un-
derlying bill, and that is why I reluc-
tantly oppose the amendment.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. PORTER. Madam Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. POR-

in part B of House Report 116–109.
Ms. PORTER. Madam Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-

Page 90, line 6, after the first dollar

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. PORTER) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
Ms. PORTER. Madam Chair, I rise
today to offer an amendment to the fis-
cal year 2020 appropriations bill that
would provide essential funding to the
Health Resources and Service Adminis-
tration, HRSA, for its critical research
to create a strategy to address inti-
mate partner violence.
Intimate partner violence is a crit-
ical public health issue that affects
millions of women, men, children, and
families. The HRSA strategy uses re-
search to help partners identify and ad-
dress key social determinants of health
and their interactions with the impacts
of intimate partner violence through
awareness, screening, and treatment.
Building on studies from the VAWA
health program, HRSA has used this
funding to couple the strategy with a
program known as Project Catalyst to
foster intimate partner violence re-
sponse and health collaboration at the
State level.
More than 25 percent of women and
11 percent of men have experienced sex-
ual violence, physical violence, or
stalking by an intimate partner in
their lifetimes, and I am one of them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4620 June 12, 2019
My three children and I were able to
move forward with our lives, staying in
our community and our home. I found
help to heal our family and let us re-
build our lives, and I relied on essential
healthcare resources in this process.
That rebuilding brought me here to ad-
vocate for survivors who escaped the
cycle of violence and to speak on be-
half of those who haven’t.
Each year, millions suffer in silence.
Our healthcare workforce needs the
tools and knowledge necessary to sup-
port every single victim of intimate
partner violence. The funding through
HRSA’s strategy to address intimate
partner violence includes the integra-
tion of intimate partner violence re-
sponses into HIV, home healthcare, and
numerous other women’s programs.
This fiscal year 2020 request will cre-
ate dedicated funding under programs
at HRSA specifically focusing on com-
munity health centers that provide es-
sential local primary and mental
healthcare.
My district in Orange County is
home to eight community health cen-
ters. I hope that with the growth of
this program, more of these providers
will have the opportunity to address
intimate partner violence.
b 0315
We need funding to complete the
work necessary to implement HRSA’s
strategy and for the growth of Project
Catalyst to add more States to this ini-
tiative.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO).
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of this amendment. First of
all, let me say a ‘‘thank you’’ to our
colleague, the gentlewoman, for having
the courage to tell her own story in
such a public way.
Intimate partner violence is a serious
public health problem. It affects mil-
lions of women and men across the
country.
The HRSA strategy to address inti-
mate partner violence focuses on
agency- and system-wide efforts to im-
prove the awareness about this vio-
lence, screening, and treatment.
The related Project Catalyst is sup-
porting these efforts at the State level.
Madam Chair, I thank the gentle-
woman for offering this amendment,
and I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I don’t
oppose the amendment, because this is
a very important topic. There is no
question about it. This is another one
of the ways that our country needs im-
provement. Certainly, the Federal Gov-
ernment is an appropriate place to look
for strategies to do that improvement.
Here is the problem: We have to set
priorities. If this is a priority—look, we
have a trillion-dollar deficit. And this
should be a priority. Let’s find a pro-
gram that is not as important, de-
crease the funding to that program, in-
crease the funding to this program.
Madam Chair, that is not the ap-
proach the amendment takes.
We are now up to $22 million, if all
the amendments pass that we have dis-
cussed since just the last amendment
vote—$22 million coming from the Sec-
retary’s management account.
You know, this is having your cake
and eating it too. This is saying: This
is important, but I am not going to
make the tough decision of what is less
important. Because it is mythical to
believe that we are going to cut $22
million out of a growing agency’s budg-
et to manage that growing agency and
not have an effect.
So, that is why I reluctantly rise to
oppose it. Madam Chair, it is about pri-
orities.
They send us to make the tough deci-
sions. The tough decision isn’t to say:
Here are all the things. Let’s go fund
them all.
The tough decision is: This is what
needs priority. And this does need pri-
ority. The tough decision is asking
what has less priority, not going to
that magical, bottomless well of the
Secretary’s management funds, be-
cause, Madam Chair, we are up to $22
million. And that is just since this
vote. I haven’t totaled up before the
last vote series.
At some point, the Secretary is going
to have to start taking out loans.
So, Madam Chair, again, I reluc-
tantly rise to oppose the amendment,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. PORTER. Madam Chair, it is not
eating cake to want women to be safe
in their homes and from their partners.
I know a lot about tough decisions
and about priorities, and I have faced
tough decisions about how to protect
my own family. And I am proud that it
is a priority of mine and of my Demo-
cratic colleagues to support full fund-
ing to stop intimate partner violence.
Madam Chair, I respectfully ask for
the support of all of my colleagues in
this amendment, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I join
the gentlewoman from California in
recognizing the incredible importance
of this. I have stated that.
Having your cake and eating it too is
not related specifically to this amend-
ment, but the idea that we have been
discussing now for 2 hours, that we
have all these things that are good—
they probably are priorities—but the
tough decision is to find where we are
going to—and not pretend that the Sec-
retary’s management budget is an end-
less well. That is just pretending.
Madam Chair, that is why 9 percent
of Americans have a favorable view of
Congress. Because, in our households,
when we make a decision about a pri-
ority to spend money on something
here, we take it out of somewhere else
where we are not going to spend
money, and not make-believe stuff.
So, Madam Chair, again: Well inten-
tioned, well needed. We need to set pri-
orities, and then we need to find places
to make the cuts to fund those prior-
ities.
I yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tlewoman from California (Ms. POR-
TER).
The question was taken; and the Act-

AMENDMENT NO. 67 OFFERED BY MS. PORTER

Ms. PORTER. Madam Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 108, strike lines 8 through 11 and in-
sert the following:
(1) Detailed monthly enrollment figures
from the Exchanges established under the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
of 2010 pertaining to enrollments during the
open enrollment period, including State en-
rollment figures disaggregated by race, eth-
nicity, preferred language, age, and sex.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. PORTER) and a
Member opposed each will control 5

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
Ms. PORTER. Madam Chair, I rise
today to offer an amendment to the fis-
cal year 2020 appropriations bill which
would require the Secretary of Health
and Human Services to provide the Ap-
propriations Committee with detailed
monthly State enrollment figures.
My amendment requires that these
figures include State enrollment num-
bers, disaggregated by race, ethnicity,
preferred language, age, and sex.
It is important to get detailed infor-
mation on who is enrolling and who
isn’t in ACA coverage. By under-
standing trends, we can look for popu-
lations that are being missed or under-
served.
In particular, under this administra-
tion, progress that we had made in re-
ducing the uninsured population has
stalled. According to the latest census
data, in 2017, for the first time since
the passage of the ACA, the Asian
American uninsured rate remained vir-
tually flat at 6.4 percent, while the Na-
tive Hawaiian and Pacific Islander un-
insured rate increased from 7.7 percent
to 8.3 percent.
Previously, disparities in
uninsurance rates among these com-
munities had been eliminated because
of coverage expansion from the ACA.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4621
June 12, 2019
Groups engaging in enrollment work
have fewer resources because of this
administration and, therefore, must
engage in more targeted and limited
outreach.
Even further, this data is from 2017,
before the administration launched
even more aggressive attacks to dis-
mantle our healthcare system after
they failed to repeal it without a re-
placement.
Our next census will show how the
attacks of 2018 and 2019 will affect en-
rollment numbers, but we need the in-
formation that essential monthly en-
rollment data can tell us long before
the census is published.
By better understanding where gaps
exist and in which groups we are seeing
negative trends in insurance enroll-
ment, we can better focus essential
outreach and education. In particular,
this will help organizations serving
hard-to-reach populations and commu-
nities of color.
While CMS has provided an annual
detailed enrollment report, it has
failed to provide more regular updates
on enrollment during the year and also
has failed to provide detailed enroll-
ment data showing enrollment for race
subgroups or data to show how people
are enrolling.
This amendment would provide the
necessary transparency into enroll-
ment trends.
I am proud to represent a diverse dis-
trict, and I came to Congress to serve
and represent their needs. I hope this
amendment will be an essential step
forward to helping Congress and the
country better understand how we are
failing communities of color and how
we can provide more accessible care.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO).
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of the gentlewoman’s
amendment, which adds this require-
ment for monthly ACA enrollment in-
formation to be disaggregated by race,
ethnicity, preferred language, age, and
sex.
The amendment will help States and
their healthcare exchanges reach un-
derserved and in-need populations that
are not yet enrolled or are under-
enrolled.
As the HHS’s Office of Minority
Health said in 2017: ‘‘In the United
States, it has been estimated that the
combined cost of health disparities and
subsequent deaths among racial and
ethnic minorities due to inadequate
and/or inequitable care is $1.24 tril-
lion.’’
We need to do more to eliminate
these disparities and improve access to
healthcare. This amendment is part of
our efforts to be able to do so, and I
urge my colleagues to support the
amendment.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, there are
a lot of wonderful things we can do, but
here is the problem: Since the last vote
series, we have actually cut manage-
ment by $22 million, and now we expect
them to do more.
This is wanting to have your cake
and eat it too. Literally, this amend-
ment causes the administration to
have to spend more.
Look, that could be a priority, but, if
we pass all the amendments that we
have considered since 1 p.m.—1 a.m.—I
am sorry—East Coast time when we
had the last vote series, we have cut
the Secretary’s ability by $22 million
to do these things.
So you have got to choose: Do you
want this, or do you want to cut the
Secretary’s budget? This is what prior-
ities are all about.
So, no matter how useful this could
be, Madam Chair, I would urge my col-
leagues, if we pass the amendments
that cut tens of millions of dollars
from management, then we can’t ac-
complish this.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. PORTER. Madam Chair, this
amendment would ultimately save dol-
lars, as explained by Chairwoman
DELAURO. It would reduce uninsurance
rates, particularly in populations that
are receiving less care.
This is, ultimately, a bill that will
reduce the costs of our healthcare sys-
tem by making all of our communities
healthier. It is a bill about equity, but
it is also a financially responsible bill.
I urge my colleagues to support it,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, again, it
is nice to believe that, somehow, if we
put this language in, we are going to
save money somehow.
This was the promise of the ACA: If
we just insure more people, for in-
stance, they won’t use the emergency
room as much. Remember that?
Back in 2010, they said: Oh, we are
using the emergency room a whole lot.
All we have to do is pass the ACA and
our emergency room usage will go
down.
What happened? It went up 20 per-
cent. Healthcare spending actually
went up.
Now, look, having insurance is a good
thing. No question about it. I am a
physician. I get it. But, to say that we
are going to save money by doing
this—no. This is going to cost money
because management has to obtain
these figures.
If this was going to save money, this
is easy. Let’s find someplace to pay for
it rather than the Secretary’s account
if it is this great money saver.
As useful as this could be, again, I
would urge my colleagues: If we pass
all the amendments, again, just the $22
million in cuts to management since
the last vote series, we can’t afford
this.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tlewoman from California (Ms. POR-
TER).
The question was taken; and the Act-

Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Madam
Chair, I rise in support of my amend-
ment, which would set aside a further
$5 million for the Minority AIDS Ini-
tiative Fund.
HIV/AIDS remains a major problem
in this country, with approximately 1.1
million people currently living with
the disease, 130,000 of whom reside in
the State of Florida, and over 26,000 in
Miami-Dade alone. It is estimated that
there are 40,000 new diagnoses every
year, with racial and ethnic minorities
making up three of four new cases.
Despite advances in medicine and re-
search and progress combating this
issue nationwide, in Miami, this trend
is going in the wrong direction. The
rate of new diagnoses in the Miami
area is three times the national aver-
age, the highest rate of anywhere in
the country.
It is critical that we devote the nec-
essary resources to curb the spread of
this disease and provide care for those
living with HIV/AIDS. The Minority
AIDS Initiative Fund plays a crucial
role in addressing key health dispari-
ties by bringing Federal, State, and
community organizations together to
test innovative solutions and address
emerging needs in communities im-
pacted by this epidemic.
My amendment will help support fur-
ther efforts to improve access to HIV
prevention and care services for racial
and ethnic minorities. In its current
capacity, the program supports more
than 33 projects and 130 community
partners across the country. This in-
crease in funding would not only ex-
pand on the successful initiatives, but

also support new ventures addressing

populations.
For example, in my home district,
the organization Prevention305 is help-
ing combat this epidemic by increasing
awareness of and access to PrEP medi-
cation, a key tool that greatly reduces
the spread of HIV.
It is critical that we continue to pro-
vide for such innovative initiatives
that help prevent the spread of this dis-
ease and provide quality care for those
infected by HIV/AIDS.
I ask my colleagues today to join me
in the fight to end this epidemic once
and for all and provide the relief to
those living with or impacted by this
disease.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the

amendment will help to address an epi-
demic in communities most in need. Of
all PrEP users, only 8 percent are Afri-
can American, and only 9 percent are
Hispanic. I might add that there is also
a very low percentage of women who
are able to access PrEP. There is a par-
ticular lack of access in the south. And
the cost of PrEP is exorbitant, in some
cases, up to $13,000.
Only half of racial minorities living
with HIV have a suppressed viral load.
That is why the underlying Labor-
HHS, Education bill that we considered
tonight, or early morning, increases
funding for HIV/AIDS prevention and
treatment activities by more than $500
million, including increases for the
Ryan White program, to increase ac-
cess to antiretroviral therapy, or ART,
community health centers, to increase
availability of pre-exposure prophy-
laxis, or PrEP, and the CDC for preven-
tion activities.
I support this amendment and, again,
commend the gentlewoman for bring-
ing it forward.
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Madam
Chair, I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, here we
go again. I mean, let’s play some more
pretend.
Look, it’s 3:30 in the morning, Amer-
ica is watching. This is why they have
a 9 percent favorable rating of us.
The fact of the matter is, this whole
budget is pretend. It pretends that our
current statute, under the Budget Con-
trol Act, isn’t at a billions of dollars
lower level. So the committee pre-
tended and said, we are going to pre-
tend that the statute is something else,
and we are going to spend all this
money, including over $500 million
more for AIDS. Laudable. It is pretend
though.
So what does this amendment do? It
just pretends a little more. It pretends
that we can take that $5 million be-
cause, Madam Chair, this comes from
that same fund. This is the Secretary’s
management fund.
We are up to $27 million we have
taken in just 21⁄2 short hours. This isn’t
a bottomless well.
I get it. We want to make a point
that—and look, congratulations to the
President. The President’s State of the
Union address, standing right on that
podium, said that we have to have a
struggle and a fight to end HIV/AIDS.
But you don’t do it by taking the
money from the Secretary’s manage-
ment fund, now up to $27 million in
just 21⁄2 short hours. Find it somewhere
else. If this is so important, find it
somewhere else. Don’t play pretend.
We are not going to fool the Amer-
ican people. When they make a budget
decision today, they choose to do some-
thing that they think is important.
They choose not to do something that
they think is less important. That is
the way they expect us to act, not play
pretend.
We have a $22 trillion debt, a $1 tril-
lion deficit, and we are playing pretend
at 3:30 in the morning. No wonder we
have a 9 percent favorable rating. No
wonder Americans don’t trust Con-
gress, because they know we make this
stuff up.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

AMENDMENT NO. 70 OFFERED BY MR. LEVIN OF
MICHIGAN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 70 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam
Chair, I have an amendment at the
desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 20, line 4, after the first dollar
amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $4,000,000)’’.
Page 135, line 13, after the first dollar
amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $4,000,000)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentleman
from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Michigan.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam
Chair, I am proud to be joined by 11 of
my colleagues from the Committee on
Education and Labor in presenting this
amendment, which would increase
funding for the Department of Edu-
cation’s Office of Inspector General, or
the EDOIG, by $4 million dollars.
EDOIG conducts independent and ob-
jective audits, investigations, and
other activities to promote the effi-
ciency, effectiveness, and integrity of
the Department.
This office helps prevent and detect
fraud, waste, and abuse, and that work
is as important now as it has ever been,
especially since the Department of
Education has violated the law on
three different occasions under this ad-
ministration.
Just last year, a Federal court ruled
that the Department’s actions during
the rollback of a loan-relief plan, had
violated Federal privacy law.
The Department also violated the
Administrative Procedures Act by arbi-
trarily refusing to discharge the stu-
dent loan payments of borrowers who
attended Corinthian College, a for-prof-
it university accused of predatory lend-
ing.
And recently, the Department ille-
gally delayed Obama-era regulations
governing online colleges, without con-
ducting the legally-required negotiated
rulemaking.
We insist upon the utmost integrity
at the Department entrusted with the
education of our children, and this
amendment will make sure that OIG
has the resources and staff it needs to
do its critical work.
I would like to reiterate my grati-
tude to my Education and Labor Com-
mittee colleagues who joined me as co-
sponsors of this amendment. And I
would also like to thank Chairman
BOBBY SCOTT and his team for his vi-
sionary leadership of our work on be-
half of students, families, workers, and
all Americans.
I also thank Chairwoman DELAURO
and Chairwoman LOWEY for working
with me on this, and for their leader-
ship on this bill which prioritizes fund-
ing for programs that provide opportu-
nities for millions of American fami-
lies. Many of those programs have been
shortchanged in recent years, and that
will no longer be the case, thanks to
the gentlewomen’s leadership.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment.
Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentlewoman from Connecticut
(Ms. DELAURO), my esteemed col-
league.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentleman for yielding, and
I rise in support of his amendment.
The mission of the Office of Inspector
General is to ‘‘conduct independent and
objective audits, investigations, and
other activities to promote the effi-
ciency, effectiveness, and integrity of
the Department’s programs and oper-
ations.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4623
June 12, 2019
We must insist on a strong ethical
framework and invest in robust over-
sight of our Federal Government. That
is why I am pleased to say that the un-
derlying Labor-HHS bill provides an in-
crease of $2.3 million, for a total of
$63.4 million for the OIG.
Over the past several years, we have
witnessed a collapse of predatory for-
profit colleges; publicly-traded Corin-
thian and ITT Technical Institutes
were among them.
The Department of Education Inspec-
tor General issued an audit report that
evaluated the ways in which the De-
partment is monitoring these institu-
tions. It concluded that the existing
Borrower Defense regulation will help
the Department better mitigate poten-
tial harm to students and taxpayers.
It is critical that we heed the infor-
mation and recommendations that
come from these reports, and we must
protect the integrity of the Borrower
Defense rule. It uncovered the mis-
management and the lack of oversight
of the student loan serving industry by
the Federal Student Loan Office, harm-
ing millions of students across this
country.
The work carried out every day by
the OIG across agencies is fundamental
to maintaining the integrity and the
efficiency of our government programs.
I commend the gentleman, and I am
happy to accept this amendment.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam
Chair, I want to commend my col-
league from Connecticut, on behalf of
the entire freshman class, for her in-
credible leadership on this bill.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, well, we
finally have a prioritization here. This
amendment actually takes money from
one program that it thinks is not as
important and puts it in another pro-
gram it thinks is underfunded. But
that is interesting because, look, the
Inspector Generals are very important.
God knows the Inspector General
over at Justice is doing a very impor-
tant job right now. He has got to look
into what the heck went on over in the
senior levels of the Department of Jus-
tice that resulted in that Steele dos-
sier, paid for by a campaign, actually
ending up causing an investigation dur-
ing a political campaign. Oh, those In-
spector Generals are important. I will
agree with on you that.
But this bill already increases the
funding of the Inspector General by 4
percent, higher than inflation. The bill
already has an increase.
Most people would think that is
enough. Most Americans, if they got a
4 percent increase in their paycheck,
they would go, wow, this is great. This
is more than inflation. We want to do
a little more.
But that is not the problem with
this. It is where the money comes
from. You see, because the money
comes from already-reduced funding at
the Office of Labor Management Stand-
ards.
So what is the Office of Labor Man-
agement because, you know, Madam
Chair, we have—at 3:45 Eastern Time
we probably don’t have millions of peo-
ple watching, but we have Americans
watching who might be asking, what is
this Office of Labor Management?
This is the one that actually sees
that unions are following the rules.
b 0345
Now, that is actually pretty impor-
tant now, because there was a major
Supreme Court decision called Janus
last year that actually said that unions
can’t force their members to pay dues
for political purposes. That is a broad,
new responsibility.
So the fact of the matter is that the
Supreme Court has basically said there
is this broad, new responsibility for the
Office of Labor-Management Standards
because, Madam Chair, we already have
reports of how unions are kind of gam-
ing this and not really complying with
the Supreme Court. The committee al-
ready cut it.
Madam Chair, I do commend the gen-
tleman, because if he has been here a
while—well, he may not have been here
for the last couple of hours, but I have
said, look, when we fund one program
more, we have got to fund another pro-
gram less. Madam Chair, I congratu-
late the gentleman for doing it.
I just disagree with what the gen-
tleman wants to fund less, because this
is critical, because American workers
who don’t believe in the politics of
what their union is promoting
shouldn’t be forced to pay for that po-
litical advocacy. Janus was clear on
that.
It is also clear that unions are trying
to get around that, and the enforce-
ment is through the Office of Labor-
Management Standards.
We should be increasing this, not de-
creasing it as it was in the baseline
budget, and certainly not decreasing it
further, as the gentleman has proposed.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam
Chair, may I inquire how much time I
have remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
has 15 seconds remaining.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam
Chair, I will close.
I will use my last 10 seconds to tell
the gentleman that the Janus decision
was nothing about people not paying
dues. Unions have not been allowed to
make people pay dues for 60 years in
this country. It was about not having
workers pay their fair share for serv-
ices that unions are forced to provide
them under U.S. law.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I stand
corrected. The gentleman is absolutely
right. It is the unions actually forcing
nonunion members to pay. And it is
equally egregious. It equally is en-
forced under this, and that is why I op-
pose it. We should actually be increas-
ing the funds.
Again, I congratulate the gentleman
for setting priorities. I just disagree
with his priorities.
Madam Chair, I urge the Members to
oppose the amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-

AMENDMENT NO. 71 OFFERED BY MS. PRESSLEY
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 71 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Chair, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 42, line 13, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(increased by $5,000,000)’’.
Page 71, line 16, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(reduced by $5,000,000)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentlewoman
from Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY)
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Massachusetts.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Chair, a
school nurse saved my life. Throughout
grade school, I was a frequent flier at
the nurse’s office, not because any-
thing was physically wrong with me,
but because the nurse’s office was a
place of refuge from the destabilizing,
predatory abuse that I was experi-
encing at the hands of people charged
with my care.
Instability, abuse, food insecurity,
and violence are serious systemic
issues that are significant barriers to
learning. Trauma is a barrier to learn-
ing.
According to the National Child
Traumatic Stress Network, more than
25 percent of American youth experi-
ence a serious traumatic event—such
as sexual abuse, community violence,
displacement—by their 16th birthday,
and many children suffer multiple and
repeated traumas.
Health and education are inex-
tricably linked, and it remains one of
the greatest public health challenges of
our time.
As a Boston city councilor, I fought
for equitable access to school nurses in
the Boston Public Schools system, and
as a Member of Congress, I plan to do
the same.
My amendment provides $5 million to
fund high-quality healthcare for chil-
dren and young people in schools and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

to support school-based health centers,
a critical safety net for our Nation’s
youth.
School-based health centers provide
excellent, accessible, trusted
healthcare and information for stu-
dents.
I firmly believe students who are
present and healthy are best prepared
and able to learn. That is true for chil-
dren across my own district in the
Massachusetts Seventh and all dis-
tricts throughout our country.
Today, nearly 4 million children are
uninsured and lack access to necessary
healthcare services. There are children
living in poverty for whom school-
based health centers and nurses are
their only source of accessible primary
and mental healthcare.
Rates of suicide, childhood chronic
illness, and community gun violence
are on the rise. This is a public health
crisis. It is downright irresponsible, un-
conscionable for us to ignore it.
In addition to funding high-quality
and accessible healthcare, my amend-
ment leverages the safety and conven-
ience of neighborhood schools, like
those across the Massachusetts Sev-
enth, to improve the health and well-
being of students and help families ac-
cess the quality healthcare they need.
School-based health centers provide
comprehensive healthcare to children
and young people in a setting that they
trust, a setting that is familiar, and a
setting that is accessible at their
school.
It was a school nurse who picked up
on the signs. Like so many children,
some act out and some shut down, and
I was one of those who shut down. Were
it not for a school nurse who saw the
signs that I was exhibiting of distress
and trauma, I doubt that I would be
here standing before you today.
There are young people like Sofia, a
junior at a Boston public high school
whom I spoke with recently, who vis-
ited the school nurse and revealed that
she was depressed, suicidal, and miss-
ing school. The proximity to the school
nurse’s staff made her feel safe and lis-
tened to, and they helped her brain-
storm ways to talk to her parents.
Within a week, she was in school-based
counseling, with the consent of her
parents, as well as working to manage
her assignments.
Unfortunately, Sofia’s story isn’t
unique. There are many students who
struggle under the weight of mental
health and trauma every day.
It was a former Surgeon General who
once said: ‘‘We can’t educate children
who are not healthy, and we can’t keep
them healthy if they aren’t educated.’’
It is our moral imperative to support
children in their health and wholeness.
My amendment asks Congress to do the
right thing, the smart thing, and in-
vest in school-based health centers to
improve the health and well-being of
our Nation’s youth.
Madam Chair, I yield 45 seconds to
the gentlewoman from Connecticut
(Ms. DELAURO).
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding,
and I rise in support of her amendment.
I will take less than 45 seconds.
Madam Chair, my view and what I
think this amendment does is it fur-
ther increases resources for the Health
Centers program. The underlying bill is
$50 million, but it expands it to provide
the opportunity for school-based care.
What we need in this Nation is men-
tal health services in every school in
this Nation to be able to recognize tell-
tale signs of adverse effects that chil-
dren are experiencing, whether it be
trauma, whether it be food insecurity,
whether it be violence or abuse, in
order to be able to prevent what could
happen as a result of those adverse ex-
periences.
Madam Chair, I support the gentle-
woman’s amendment.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I claim
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, there is
no arguing that these programs are im-
portant, but, again, we have to set pri-
orities.
This doesn’t say this program is im-
portant, and this other one is less im-
portant so we are going to take money
from it. In fact, it takes money from
CMS management.
Now, that is kind of interesting, be-
cause I have a lot of seniors in my dis-
trict who depend upon Medicare being
administered properly.
Thirteen thousand seniors enter
Medicare every day, and what this
amendment does is cut the funding to
HHS that oversees the management of
CMS, oversees the management of
those 13,000 people entering Medicare
every day.
I have no argument with these school
health programs. They are important.
But if they are important, then we
have to choose what is less important.
I wouldn’t have chosen, certainly,
the management of the Medicare pro-
gram. I think the seniors in my district
would beg to differ that that is a good
priority choice.
For that reason, Madam Chair, I re-
luctantly oppose the amendment be-
cause it doesn’t set the priorities that
need to be set, despite how important
they are.
Madam Chair, I thank the gentle-
woman from Massachusetts for recog-
nizing the importance of these pro-
grams.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Chair, I
could argue that this amendment will
actually find administrative savings to
cover healthcare costs.
Further, it has been my experience
that the elders and the grandparents I
work with are deeply concerned about
the state of their grandchildren and
the growing chronic illness, mental
health, substance abuse issues, rates of
suicide.
Furthermore, persistent disparities
exist in my district and districts
throughout the country where ZIP
Code determines your health outcomes.
Children in Dorchester are two times
more likely to be hospitalized, three
times more for asthma, than children
in more affluent parts of my district.
We should leverage every tool avail-
able to us to ensure that all children,
regardless of where they live, have ac-
cess to the health services they need to
thrive.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, again, I
am not going to argue about the impor-
tance of the clinics, but to somehow
suggest that a program that is a com-
plete subsidy program—Madam Chair,
all we have to do is just read. This is,
again, why the American people just
have to read the amendment.
The amendment doesn’t say anything
about forcing administrative savings.
It says we are going to administra-
tively cut. It doesn’t suggest how sav-
ings are going to be found.
Again, it is important to get that $5
million for this program, but for heav-
en’s sake, the fact of the matter is we
have to make priority decisions. I
would offer that cutting the adminis-
tration for Medicare, when we take
13,000 people into the program every
day, is not the proper offset for this.
