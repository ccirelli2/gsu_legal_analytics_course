f
THE FUTURE OF CONGRESS
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to speak about the future of our
Congress.
I stand here today at a crossroads: a
crossroads of cooperation, a crossroads
of bipartisanship, and a crossroads of
accomplishment.
This is a chance to begin to make
Americans proud of our Congress once
again, certainly more proud than the 13
percent approval rating that we cur-
rently have.
Republicans and Democrats can have
different opinions. They should have
different opinions. But they should
never push these opinions to such ex-
tremes that we end up hurting our good
American people.
In the next 21⁄2 weeks, both sides of
the aisle can truly achieve greatness.
Mr. Speaker, we came here not to be
great Democrats nor to be great Re-
publicans. We came here to become,
and to be, great Americans. I pray to
God that we will be.
God bless our great country of Amer-
ica.
f
RECOGNIZING HOLOCAUST
REMEMBRANCE DAY
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, this past Sunday, the
world joined together in honoring the
memory of those who were murdered
during the Holocaust.
In 2005, the United Nations des-
ignated January 27 as International
Holocaust Remembrance Day.
The systematic, government-spon-
sored persecution and murder of 6 mil-
lion Jews by the Nazi regime and its
collaborators will always be a scar on
humanity.
We promise to always remember
those who lost their lives, those who
survived, and those who saved them,
those who stood in the face of such evil
and refused to turn a blind eye. We
make this promise to ensure such
blight on humanity will never happen
again.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1288 January 30, 2019
By remembering the events of the
Holocaust, we can understand how im-
portant it is to defend those who are
defenseless. We must eradicate hatred
and never become indifferent to the
suffering of others.
Mr. Speaker, on the international
day of remembrance, the most impor-
tant thing to reflect upon is the hu-
manity that exists in all of us.
f
PREVENTING THE NEXT
SHUTDOWN
(Mr. HARDER of California asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute and to revise
and extend his remarks.)
Mr. HARDER of California. Mr.
Speaker, I rise to say I am embarrassed
by the past month.
This is my first week in Congress
without our government being shut
down. I came to Washington to help my
community. It is a shame that the
benchmark for progress so far has been
whether or not the government has
even been open. It is hard to lower the
bar from there. We can’t let this hap-
pen again.
Alongside some of my freshman col-
leagues, I have cosponsored legislation
that says, even if the government shuts
down, Congress will still have the fund-
ing to pay our Federal workers.
And it goes further than that. If Con-
gress fails to make a deal, we should
withhold pay from Members of Con-
gress, we should stop using taxpayer
dollars for travel, and we should end
bonuses for the executive branch.
In other words, if the government
shuts down, the people at fault should
be held accountable, not the workers.
If families in my district can’t get
their paychecks or if farmers can’t get
their USDA grants, then elected offi-
cials need to feel the consequences.
Mr. Speaker, governing from one cri-
sis to the next is an embarrassment. I
came here to do better. We have a
chance to turn it around right now.
f
FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IS
POSSIBLE
(Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr.
Speaker, as my new Governor just
mentioned in her first budget address,
in South Dakota, we don’t spend
money we don’t have.
South Dakota has never incurred any
general obligation debt, and that
doesn’t happen by accident. It takes
decades of prudent and, sometimes, un-
popular decisions. I am proud to be a
part of that history.
Now, in Washington, the story is a
little different. We haven’t always had
that same kind of intestinal fortitude,
so our debt is $22 trillion.
Mr. Speaker, I know there is plenty
of blame to go around, but I am more
interested in solutions. Taking our
medicine—and we do need to take our
medicine—will not be easy, and we
can’t do it all at once, but I am ready
to take the tough votes. I am hopeful
that some of my colleagues are as well.
After all, fiscal responsibility is pos-
sible. Just ask South Dakota.
f
GUN SAFETY
(Mrs. MCBATH asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, when it
comes to gun violence, we talk about
Parkland, we talk about Trayvon Mar-
tin, and we talk about Jordan Davis.
But I want to take a moment today for
the victims whom we don’t always talk
about.
I want to talk about the nearly 100
Americans who lose their lives to gun
violence in this country every single
day.
I want to talk about the mothers and
the fathers who have suffered tragic
loss—the voices that we don’t always
hear.
Just last week, four lost their lives
in a shooting just a few miles outside
of my district in Georgia. Those four
families are torn apart forever.
Each day, nearly 100 families are torn
apart forever. For those loved ones,
thoughts and prayers are simply not
enough. We need policy and we need
change. It is on us here in Congress to
do something.
Mr. Speaker, I pray that my col-
leagues here and in the Senate will
support me in acting to pass meaning-
ful gun safety legislation
f
FLOOD INSURANCE FOR FARMERS
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to highlight a bipartisan bill
that I have been working on with my
colleague from California (Mr.
GARAMENDI). This week, we introduced
H.R. 830, the Flood Insurance for Farm-
ers Act.
Currently, FEMA’s requirements for
flood hazard areas essentially prohibit
farmers from expanding or improving
operations on what they deem as
floodplains, often requiring barns and
silos to be raised upwards of 10 feet,
which can be very cost prohibitive for
farmers and prevent needed buildings.
This legislation would remove this un-
necessary red tape, while also allowing
farmers to pay more reasonable flood
insurance rates that align with their
true level of risk.
If levees in the area provide a 50-year
level of flood protection, FEMA would
then charge rates based on that risk
level instead of the lack of 100-year
flood protection of the existing levee
system, which, essentially, means zero
availability for flood insurance.
From the north State to the Sac-
ramento Valley and beyond, this legis-
lation is good for agriculture produc-
tion in California. I urge its passage.
f
JAMES ISLAND OCEAN
ACTKIDVISTS
(Mr. CUNNINGHAM asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker,
today I rise to share the story of a very
remarkable group of children: the
James Island Ocean ActKIDvists—
Betty, Louis, Makena, and Liam—all
between the ages of 6 and 8, who have
made it their mission to protect our
oceans and our marine life.
Recently, they successfully lobbied
the Charleston and James Island City
Councils to ban plastic bags, straws,
and foam containers, collecting over
300 signatures in support of the ban. At
town council meetings, these young ac-
tivists had the courage to speak up for
the marine life that could not speak for
itself.
It is our job to preserve the low coun-
try’s vibrant natural resources for fu-
ture generations to come. I am proud
of the James Island Ocean ActKIDvists
for helping lead the way. I thank
Betty, Louis, Makena, and Liam.
f
WASHINGTON IS BROKEN
(Mr. BRINDISI asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BRINDISI. Mr. Speaker, it is an
honor to stand here today as a Rep-
resentative of New York’s 22nd Con-
gressional District.
When I talk to upstate New Yorkers,
there is one thing I hear time and time
again: that Washington is broken.
We are all tired of Washington’s par-
tisanship, and I am here today to reit-
erate my promise to work with anyone
who is willing to solve problems.
I will work with Members of both
parties to address skyrocketing
healthcare costs and make sure every-
one has access to high-quality, afford-
able care.
I will work to bring good jobs to up-
state New York, strengthen our
schools, and improve job training pro-
grams.
I will fight to make sure our local
farmers have the support they need to
get a fair price for their goods, succeed
financially, and make an honest living.
And I will stand with servicemembers
and veterans to ensure they have the
support and resources they need when
wearing our country’s uniform and
when they return home.
I will fight for everyday people and
take on companies that use power
through monopolies to abuse con-
sumers.
Above all else, my top priority will
be to listen to my constituents, to be a
voice for upstate New Yorkers.
I know that, by working together, we
can deliver real results for hard-
working people.

PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION
OF H.R. 790, FEDERAL CIVILIAN
WORKFORCE PAY RAISE FAIR-
NESS ACT OF 2019, AND PRO-
VIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF
MOTIONS TO SUSPEND THE
RULES
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, by direc-
tion of the Committee on Rules, I call
up House Resolution 87 and ask for its
immediate consideration.
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 87
Resolved, That at any time after adoption
of this resolution the Speaker may, pursuant
to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the
House resolved into the Committee of the
Whole House on the state of the Union for
consideration of the bill (H.R. 790) to provide
for a pay increase in 2019 for certain civilian
employees of the Federal Government, and
for other purposes. The first reading of the
bill shall be dispensed with. All points of
order against consideration of the bill are
waived. General debate shall be confined to
the bill and shall not exceed one hour equal-
ly divided and controlled by the chair and
ranking minority member of the Committee
on Oversight and Reform. After general de-
bate the bill shall be considered for amend-
ment under the five-minute rule. The amend-
ment printed in part A of the report of the
Committee on Rules accompanying this res-
olution shall be considered as adopted in the
House and in the Committee of the Whole.
The bill, as amended, shall be considered as
read. All points of order against provisions
in the bill, as amended, are waived. No fur-
ther amendment to the bill, as amended,
shall be in order except those printed in part
B of the report of the Committee on Rules.
Each such further amendment may be of-
fered only in the order printed in the report,
may be offered only by a Member designated
in the report, shall be considered as read,
shall be debatable for the time specified in
the report equally divided and controlled by
the proponent and an opponent, shall not be
subject to amendment, and shall not be sub-
ject to a demand for division of the question
in the House or in the Committee of the
Whole. All points of order against such fur-
ther amendments are waived. At the conclu-
sion of consideration of the bill for amend-
ment the Committee shall rise and report
the bill, as amended, to the House with such
further amendments as may have been
adopted. The previous question shall be con-
sidered as ordered on the bill, as amended,
and on any further amendment thereto, to
final passage without intervening motion ex-
cept one motion to recommit with or with-
out instructions.
SEC. 2. It shall be in order at any time
through the legislative day of February 8,
2019, for the Speaker to entertain motions
that the House suspend the rules as though
under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or
her designee shall consult with the Minority
Leader or his designee on the designation of
any matter for consideration pursuant to
this section.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland is recognized
for 1 hour.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, for the
purpose of debate only, I yield the cus-
tomary 30 minutes to the gentleman
from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL), pending
which I yield myself such time as I
may consume. During consideration of
this resolution, all time yielded is for
the purpose of debate only.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland?
There was no objection.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, on Tues-
day, the Rules Committee met and re-
ported a rule, House Resolution 87, pro-
viding for consideration of H.R. 790, the
Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise
Fairness Act of 2019.
The rule provides for consideration of
the legislation under a structured rule.
The rule self-executes a manager’s
amendment, which strikes section 3 of
the bill and makes certain other tech-
nical corrections to it.
The rule makes in order three
amendments. The rule provides 1 hour
of debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and the ranking
member of the Committee on Oversight
and Reform. Finally, the rule provides
suspension authority through the legis-
lative day of February 8, 2019.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 790 will provide for
a 2.6 percent pay increase for Federal
civilian workers in 2019, beginning with
the date of passage, and this brings the
civilian pay increase in parity with the
automatic adjustment of pay for mili-
tary servicemembers, which is also 2.6
percent.
The President’s fiscal year 2019 budg-
et requested a 2.6 percent increase in
basic pay for military servicemembers
equivalent to the statutory formula.
This increase went into effect on Janu-
ary 1. But on August 30 of last year,
President Trump announced that he
would issue a downward adjustment of
the pay increase for civilian employees
because of a national emergency or se-
rious economic conditions affecting the
general welfare. He proposed to set the
civilian pay increase at zero, no raise.
On December 28 of last year, he fol-
lowed through on this announcement
by signing an executive order over-
riding the automatic 2.1 percent pay
increase civilian workers were set to
receive and replacing it with zero. Con-
gress can override and Congress should
override this executive order with leg-
islation providing for a pay increase for
our hardworking Federal civilian work-
ers. H.R. 790 does just that with a rea-
sonable 2.6 percent increase, matching
the increase going into effect for mili-
tary servicemembers.
Mr. Speaker, if there is any redeem-
ing feature to the sordid chaos of the
35-day government shutdown, the long-
est in U.S. history, surely, it is that it
reminded America that our Federal
workforce is indispensable to our com-
merce, to our economy, to our society,
and to our way of life.
We have been reminded that if you
take away the air traffic controllers,
you take away air travel. If you take
away the Transportation Security Ad-
ministration agents, you take away
transportation security.
If you take away the Park Service
rangers and the Park Service mainte-
nance personnel, you take away our
ability to enjoy the national parks free
of liter, garbage, backed-up sewage,
and criminal activity.
If you take away the food safety in-
spectors from the FDA and other agen-
cies, you threaten the food supply with
E. coli, salmonella, and insect infesta-
tion.
If you shut down the EPA, you em-
power the polluters to foul the air and
dirty the waters.
If you shut down the Department of
Justice, you throw a monkey wrench
into the ability of law enforcement to
go after the Mafia, Medicare fraud,
white-collar crime, human trafficking,
and all of the criminal enterprises en-
dangering public safety.
If you shut down the National Weath-
er Service, you threaten transpor-
tation, travel, and public safety.
If you stop paying Customs and Bor-
der Protection officers, you weaken
border security and you demoralize our
Border Patrol.
If you shut down NOAA, you disable
America’s first responders in the cam-
paign to meet the challenges of climate
change.
All of it has an effect on the private
sector, too. If you furlough the people
writing checks for home mortgages,
farm subsidies, State Department per-
sonnel, and private contractor pay-
ments, you threaten to ruin private
contractors, home purchases, small
farmers, and small businesses.
If you were to cut off the VA, you
would cut off the veterans.
And if you were to pull the plug on
the Social Security Administration,
you would threaten tens of millions of
Americans who depend on Social Secu-
rity.
The contribution that more than 2.1
million Federal employees make to our
country is indispensable; it is incalcu-
lable; and it is irreplaceable.
Mr. Speaker, throughout the 35-day
self-identified Donald Trump shut-
down, the American people not only
witnessed the surpassing dedication
and patriotism of the Federal work-
force, 30 percent of which is made up of
veterans, but we were reminded of the
critical nature of the work that they
do for all of us. They deserve a raise,
and we should override President
Trump’s insulting and embarrassing
2019 pay freeze for the Federal work-
force.
To be clear, Federal workers deserved
a raise before the shutdown. The Fed-
eral Salary Council, an advisory body
of the executive branch established to
provide recommendations on locality
pay, found at the end of last year that,
‘‘Federal employee salaries on average
lag behind those of the private sector
by almost 31 percent,’’ a finding based
on U.S. Department of Labor data cov-
ering more than 250 different occupa-
tional categories.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1290 January 30, 2019
900,000 Federal workers earn less
than $60,000 a year, and we have seen in
the soup kitchens and in the pantries,
and the desperate pleas of our constitu-
ents for their families, how many Fed-
eral workers are just one or two pay-
checks away from disaster.
So Federal workers deserved a raise
before the shutdown when 800,000 of
them were furloughed or compelled to
go to work without any pay and they
had to take out loans from family
members or credit unions just to pay
their monthly bills.
They deserved a raise before Presi-
dent Trump imposed the Federal hiring
freeze in 2017 and before he froze Fed-
eral worker pay in 2019.
They deserved a raise before he tried
to cut their health benefits and before
he issued three executive orders that
would have made it easier to fire Fed-
eral workers and destroy their collec-
tive bargaining rights, orders that were
promptly struck down in Federal
court.
But if the Federal workers deserved a
raise and needed one before President
Trump declared war on the workforce
for the American Government, before
Steve Bannon defined the goal of the
administration as ‘‘deconstruction of
the administrative state,’’ before they
were derided by the President as Demo-
crats and vilified as the deep state,
surely, the economic and moral debacle
of the shutdown makes this modest 2.6
percent pay raise a powerful and ines-
capable imperative today.
Mr. Speaker, the Federal Govern-
ment simply must do much better as
an employer of our own people. How
many private employers would try to
retain their best workers and attract
great new workers by attacking and
furloughing the workforce, by accusing
the employees of disloyalty, by freez-
ing their pay, and then by compelling
them to work for 35 days with no sal-
ary at all? It would never work for the
vast majority of private-sector employ-
ers.
All over America, we read of workers
demoralized and defeated, thinking of
leaving their Federal jobs because of
the sheer folly and cruelty of this most
recent episode and because the Presi-
dent, I am sorry to report, is again
threatening another shutdown with
nothing but complicity from many of
our friends across the aisle.
On top of all the anxiety induced by
the shutdown, we know that between 30
and 35 percent of the Federal workforce
is eligible to retire within the next 5
years. How will we replace them and
replenish the ranks of this embattled
and besieged workforce?
These are our people, Mr. Speaker.
These are our workers. These are our
constituents. These are the people who
make America work.
Federal workers do not live the life-
styles of the rich and famous. They
don’t jet down to Mar-a-Lago at per-
sonal or government expense. And they
can’t afford the $36 cheeseburger at the
Trump Hotel.
The Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur
Ross, will never be able to figure out
why they can’t just call up a friendly
banker for a loan, just as Lara Trump
will not be able to see why the 35-day
shutdown caused something more than
an eentsy-weentsy ‘‘little bit of pain’’
for them as they are invited to suffer
in service of the greater glory of the
Trump administration agenda.
Our public servants, civilian and
military alike, deserve better from us,
whether they work as a civilian officer
or uniformed officer at the Pentagon;
whether they are safeguarding air trav-
el or the air or the water or the cli-
mate or our food supply; whether they
are taking care of our treasured na-
tional parks; or treating breast cancer
patients or finding the cure for cystic
fibrosis or multiple sclerosis; or run-
ning our museums; or cutting Social
Security checks; or preparing the
President’s meals at the White House;
or guarding the coastline with the
Coast Guard; or making the justice
system work as judges, prosecutors, de-
fenders, clerks, and marshals. They de-
serve better from us.
They need a pay raise, not a pay
freeze. They deserve our respect, not
our contempt. They don’t ask to be dei-
fied, but they don’t deserve to be de-
monized.
They have an important job to do.
Let’s pay them for it. Let’s invest in
our Federal workforce. I urge all of our
colleagues to come together to pass
H.R. 790, the Federal Civilian Work-
force Pay Raise Fairness Act of 2019.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman
from Maryland for yielding. I would
like to pick up where my friend from
Maryland left off. They don’t deserve
to be deified, but they don’t deserve to
be demonized either. That doesn’t just
apply to our Federal workforce. That
applies to so many elements of our con-
versation today.
I hope you have a chance, Mr. Speak-
er, to go watch the Rules Committee
debate last night on this rule. You
might have thought that, with a simple
two-page resolution such as this one,
we might have been up and out in
about 10 minutes, making three amend-
ments in order.
But, no, we spent the better part of
almost 3 hours there talking with the
committee experts on the issue, Mr.
CONNOLLY from Virginia and Mr. MEAD-
OWS from North Carolina. You would be
affected by the amount of agreement
that those two gentlemen had.
b 0930
Now, Mr. Speaker, I don’t want to
say you would be surprised, because
you might know those two gentlemen
as I do, you might know this issue as I
do, and you might know its bipartisan
roots and its bipartisan future as I do.
But if you don’t watch that hearing,
if you don’t know the issue, if all you
do is see a bill that was dropped in the
hopper just a couple of days ago, has
had no markup in committee, has had
no hearings, has had no witnesses, and
has had no dialogue whatsoever on it,
but happened to be dropped in the mid-
dle of the week where some of the more
cynical among us expected us to still
be in a government shutdown before
the President brought us out of it, this
might just look like a messaging state-
ment to folks who view it through that
lens.
It is so frustrating and disappointing
to me because this is an issue on which
we agree. My friend from Oklahoma, an
appropriator, happens to be the rank-
ing member up on the Rules Com-
mittee. In testimony last night, we are
talking about not an insignificant
amount of money in this bill; we are
talking about not millions with an M,
we are talking about billions with a B
of dollars going out the door.
The question is: Where do the dollars
come from?
The answer is: They are just going to
come from other accounts these agen-
cies already have.
I don’t know what other account that
is, and I think that is worth having a
conversation about.
If you read through this language,
Mr. Speaker, you will see no effort
whatsoever to do what every single one
of us knows needs to be done, and that
is to find those Federal employees who
make us proud at agencies every single
day, reward that service, protect that
service, encourage that service, and
make sure retention plans are in place
for those employees. There is not a line
in here to target those high per-
formers.
Equally, look through this legisla-
tion, Mr. Speaker, to find those folks
whom I know—because I hear it from
my veterans in my district every day,
and I hear it from the leadership in the
VA every day—find those folks who
just do not want to show up and serve.
Somehow they got involved in Federal
service. They are the exception, not
the rule. They bring their colleagues in
Federal service down instead of lifting
them up. They bring the folks they are
intended to serve down instead of lift-
ing them up. There is no effort to iden-
tify those folks and no effort to reward
the high performers while trying to
train up the low performers. In true
government fashion, it says that the
definition of success is to treat abso-
lutely everybody the same.
Mr. Speaker, there is no one else
doing this work other than us. The
problem in the civil service system
isn’t that we protect employees. That
is laud worthy. That is a laudable goal.
What the problem is in civil service is
we are the only ones who do the over-
sight. There is no other board of direc-
tors. It is us.
Yet we bring a bill to the floor that
we claim raises our Federal employees
up and praises our Federal employees.
We didn’t even give it the dignity of a
hearing or a markup. We can do better

than that, and candidly, I think we
will.
We will never know what would have
happened had we not gotten started on
the foot we got started on in January
as we did. I particularly regret that for
our freshmen who are trying to figure
out what the tone and tenor is of this
place. This isn’t it. Apparently, Repub-
licans got us in bad habits in the last
session of just dropping bills in the
hopper and bringing them to the floor
the next day, no hearings, no markup.
It was wrong then, and it is not wise
now either.
We have a lot of choices to make
going forward, Mr. Speaker.
Are we poisoning the well, or are we
protecting it?
Are we tilling the fields, or are we
spreading salt in them?
We don’t need to deify our ideolog-
ical opponents, but we don’t need to de-
monize them either. There is more that
unites this country than divides this
country, Mr. Speaker. Our Federal em-
ployees do deserve our trust, our appre-
ciation, and, yes, a paycheck at the end
of the week for the work they have
done on our behalf.
They also deserve a way to be recog-
nized when they go above and beyond.
They also deserve to know that folks
on their team who are not up to the
task today are either going to be
trained up or moved out.
We can do those things together. For
reasons that are not clear to me, we
have not chosen to try. This could have
been a bipartisan effort. This could
have been part of a larger package, and
it wasn’t. I regret that.
I will tell my friend from Maryland I
did not bring any additional speakers
with me who would have shared that
very same message, so when he is pre-
pared to close as am I.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my
dear friend from Georgia for his
thoughtful comments, especially for
conceding that the Federal workers do
deserve a paycheck at the end of the
week, and I am glad that we can start
off a new season here where we agree
that Federal workers deserve and need
to be paid. I suppose we still have this
difference about whether or not they
deserve a pay raise.
Yes, the substance is clear. We are
fighting for a 2.6 percent pay raise for
the Federal civilian workforce to
match the 2.6 percent pay raise that
has gone into effect for the military
servicemembers who are serving our
country with their hard work and their
sacrifice.
Mr. Speaker, our message is clear.
There is a message that is built into
there, because when you are deciding
whether or not to give your workers a
raise or give them a pay freeze or you
are deciding whether or not to praise
them or to compel them to work for
free for 35 days or to furlough them,
there is a message built into that. So
we are the employer of these 2 million
people who have come to work for the
Federal Government, and there is a
message there.
It is not just the money for their
families, it is not just the money to
pay the mortgage and to pay the rent
and for the car bills and for the food
bills and for health insurance and so
on. There is a message there, and the
message is simple: we stand with the
Federal workers.
That is the message. We embrace
that message that is built into the pay
raise here.
But I have to disagree with my friend
if he says that all we are doing is send-
ing that message that we stand with
the Federal workers. That is not all we
are doing, we are giving them a pay
raise they deserve. We have got tens of
thousands of people who work at the
Pentagon who go dressed as military
servicemembers every day, and we have
tens of thousands who go dressed as ci-
vilians, they work side by side, and
they work together for the country.
Shouldn’t they all get a pay raise?
Don’t all of them deserve a pay raise?
Now, Mr. Speaker, my friend invites
us to believe that because we are giv-
ing the workforce a pay raise, we can’t
continue to implement civil service
rules that are meant to get rid of the
rare bad apple that you get in the Fed-
eral workforce.
Why not?
Why can’t we use the other mecha-
nisms that are in place to reward work-
ers?
If we want to improve those, then I
am so happy to work with my friend on
the Rules Committee to develop legis-
lation to do that. But I am afraid that
is an irrelevant distraction from the
matter at hand. The matter at hand
today is whether or not we are going to
give the same pay raise to civilian
workers that we have given to military
workers.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON
LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Maryland
for his astute analysis and his service
on the Rules Committee, and I thank
my good friend from Georgia for offer-
ing his recognition of the value of our
Federal workers.
Mr. Speaker, this morning, I started
my day, first of all, with supporting
H.R. 21, and gathering with the leader-
ship of the House and Senate recog-
nizing that Social Security must be
strengthened. But truly I joined in my
long-term commitment for not only
the survival of Social Security, but the
survival of our families and seniors—3
million senior women living in pov-
erty, 2 million senior men. These indi-
viduals have worked. They may have
been Federal employees.
I then joined my colleagues, House
and Senate, on supporting pay equity
for women. And now I am on the floor
dealing with a crucial component of
survival in this Nation.
I thank Mr. CONNOLLY and the Over-
sight Committee for bringing this bill.
It is important, as I speak about the
needs, to emphasize that we can do
nothing else but pass this bill, the Sen-
ate pass this bill, and the President
signs this bill.
For the idea of paycheck inequality,
for example, that will be debated later
today, it is important to know that
women working full-time still earn 80
percent on average for every dollar
earned by men, and women of color
face the brunt of inequality, African-
American women 61 cents on the dol-
lar, Latinas earning 53 cents on the
dollar, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Is-
lander women earning 62 percent with
white non-Hispanic men.
So what are we doing today?
We are saying that the executive
order squeezing Federal workers in the
middle of the shutdown by the Presi-
dent of the United States in an execu-
tive order is null and void.
As I left for Washington talking to
TSO officers who had worked and
worked and worked with no pay as es-
sential workers, one quietly said to me:
Are we going to get our pay raise? Are
you going to fight against the execu-
tive order?
Mr. Speaker, I said to them: We sure
will.
We want Democrats and Republicans.
But I said: We sure will.
So I rise today to support this legis-
lation that deals with the Federal Ci-
vilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness
Act of 2019. Texas has over 270,000 Fed-
eral employees. I have 4,000 in my dis-
trict. The cost of the pay raise would
be approximately $25 billion. President
Trump’s tax reform bill costs over 10
times that amount.
It is important to note that this is a
2.6 percent pay raise for Federal civil-
ian workers and establishes pay parity
between the military and service work-
ers.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the
gentlewoman from Texas an additional
30 seconds.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it
is ridiculous to say that Federal em-
ployees have been paid too much. They
have been victims of attacks of, What
do these people do? There have been
charges of waste, fraud, and abuse.
With the government shutdown we
know what these workers do. They
take care of our parks, they keep them
safe. They keep the airways, the avia-
tion industry, the aviation system in
America and around the world alive
with the best air traffic controllers in
the world. They protect the airports
with TSOs.
Mr. Speaker, I support enthusiasti-
cally the 2.6 percent increase. Let’s do
it now. Let the President sign the bill.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I am always affected by the words of
the gentlewoman from Texas, but my
answer is clear: No, everybody doesn’t

deserve a pay raise all the time; it is
true on my staff, it is true in my life,
it is true in every private-sector com-
pany in the country, and it is true in
the Federal Government too.
Now we won’t be able to have that
conversation because there was no
hearing on this bill. We won’t be able
to improve that circumstance because
this bill doesn’t try to expand itself to
that scope.
We are in a new age. I won’t be able
to close this debate, Mr. Speaker. My
friend from Maryland will be able to
close as is the privilege of the major-
ity.
The other privilege of the majority is
titling the bills as they are coming to
the floor. This is the Federal Civilian
Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act, and
the definition of fairness in this case is
that civilian workers be treated the
same as military workers as it relates
to a cost-of-living increase. That is
worthy of debate.
I know many of my friends who rep-
resent the Washington, D.C. metropoli-
tan area that have so many civilian
Federal workers believe in that equity
issue deeply and passionately and have
worked to protect it over a long num-
ber of years. In the State of Georgia,
we have many DOD employees, folks
whose tempo changes regularly, folks
who are called on with increasing fre-
quency, folks who ask: Where shall I go
when you send me?
That is qualitatively different serv-
ice.
Should it be treated differently?
Again, this is not the right place for
that conversation. This is a debate on
a rule about whether or not we will
bring up a bill that the folks on the
other side of the aisle absolutely have
the votes to pass if they want to pass
it.
In fact, it is language in the bill that
we could absolutely move in a bipar-
tisan way if we had it in the conversa-
tions. It is language that could have
absolutely been part of the negotia-
tions to end the government shutdown
since this was a decision that the
President made back in December of
last year not to institute the 2.1. If
folks had gone to the negotiating table,
if folks had negotiated in good faith, if
folks had said that this is what we
need, and this is what we think is im-
portant, then we could have solved this
long before now.
But this bill was dropped just days
ago, again, with no hearing and no
markups, and here it is before us.
b 0945
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, as well as add any
extraneous material, immediately
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia?
There was no objection.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, if we
defeat the previous question, I intend
to bring up a very simple amendment
that would address just one of the
questions that we would have ad-
dressed if we considered this issue im-
portant enough to have the committee
of jurisdiction actually gather and hold
a hearing on it; and that is the ques-
tion of those who are delinquent in
their taxes: those folks who have an
outstanding tax bill, who have not
tried to enter into a negotiated settle-
ment, those who are not in a payment
plan, but those who simply are not
paying their Federal taxes, that they
not be a part of this pay increase.
My constituents work hard every day
of the week. They expect us to be doing
the oversight. They expect us to be
doing performance reviews. They ex-
pect us to be looking at who is showing
up and who is going the extra mile, re-
warding those folks who are going the
extra mile, training those folks up who
are not, and not rewarding those folks
who are falling well below the stand-
ards that each and every one of us ex-
pect as taxpayers and, candidly, even
more so, each and every Federal em-
ployee expects of his or her colleagues.
I want good work to be recognized
with good pay, Mr. Speaker, but what
would be better than this bill is a com-
prehensive plan from the Committee
on Oversight and Reform to reform the
civil service system so that that is not
an aspirational goal but an absolute
certainty that the American people can
count on.
The best thing we can do to respect
our fellow employees, Mr. Speaker, is
not to have a messaging bill come to
the House of Representatives. The best
thing we can do for our Federal em-
ployees is to make sure that the rep-
utation that travels across the land is
not one of underperformance but is one
of overperformance.
We are the only ones who can deal
with the issues of bad apples spoiling
an entire barrel. We are the only ones
who can do it. We owe it to every agen-
cy in this land to be their partner in
getting that done. By defeating the
previous question and including this
amendment, we will take a small step
in that direction.
Mr. Speaker, unless my friend is pre-
pared to close, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
The gentleman from Georgia has
given me a lot to think about here.
The very first thing that I need to
clear up is that 85 percent of the Fed-
eral workforce does not live in the na-
tional capital region. It is true that the
local delegations from Maryland and
Virginia and the District of Columbia
are sensitive to these continuing as-
saults on the Federal workforce be-
cause we have so many workers who
live here, but, again, 85 percent of the
workforce lives all over the country.
I just learned that there are 100,000
civilian Federal workers in Georgia
who also were affected by this govern-
ment shutdown and lockout of the Fed-
eral workers, and I am sure the distin-
guished gentleman from Georgia heard
the same kinds of complaints from his
constituents that I heard from mine
about not being able to balance their
checkbooks, not being able to pay the
mortgage or pay the rent because of
what took place with the shutdown.
The President froze Federal worker
pay without any hearings. The Presi-
dent froze Federal worker pay without
any markups, and he did it without
consulting any of us. That is some-
thing that he did.
Now, of course, we know that the
115th Congress, the last Congress, be-
came famous—or perhaps I should say
infamous—for being the most closed
Congress in U.S. history, bringing us
the most number of closed rules on the
floor, shutting down debate, bringing
us so many bills without hearings or
markup.
We would have loved to have been
able to have hearings and markup for
this bill, but the Committee on Over-
sight and Reform wasn’t organized
until yesterday. We are all recovering
from the shocks of the Federal Govern-
ment shutdown. We are all trying to
catch our breath from what has been
imposed on the country. We have been
consumed entirely with the question of
the government shutdown.
So when the new rules come into
focus and are activated on March 1,
which is when they are supposed to
come in, we have every intention of
being a dramatically more open Con-
gress than what we saw in the last Con-
gress.
But we appreciate the push from our
friends. They should give us the push.
Certainly, they know what it is like to
close down debate because they did it
for so many years.
Now I understand they are sug-
gesting, as a substitute resolution,
what they want instead is a prohibition
on raises for Federal employees with
delinquent tax debt.
It is very clear that the Federal civil-
ian workforce is graded on an annual
basis, and you can get five different
kinds of rankings. These are dealt with
in the promotion process, in all kinds
of personnel actions, including exclu-
sion and separation in cases of delin-
quency where Federal workers are not
performing. So the idea that the Fed-
eral civil service has existed all of this
time without the ability to have incen-
tives and disincentives and sanctions
for nonperformance is, of course, quite
apart from reality.
I am amazed that my friends would
be immodest enough to raise the ques-
tion of taxes in their opposition to this
legislation. The first problem, of
course, is that they passed a $1.5 tril-
lion tax cut for the wealthiest corpora-
tions and people in America—$1.5 tril-
lion.
Mr. Speaker, a trillion dollars is a
thousand billion dollars.
So they piled what it is going to be a
$1.9 trillion addition to our national
debt over the next decade, at least. The

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1293
January 30, 2019
Congressional Budget Office estimates
that it adds at least $1.9 trillion to our
debt, yet they come back and say that
they don’t want to give a 2.6 percent
pay increase to our Federal workers,
who were just furloughed or compelled
to go to work with no pay for the last
35 days.
Prohibition on raises for Federal em-
ployees with delinquent tax debt, that
is their attempt to distract everybody
from the pay raise that America’s Fed-
eral workforce needs.
What about the President of the
United States? What about his taxes?
Are they finally going to support re-
lease of President Trump’s taxes,
which is what the last four decades of
Presidents, Republicans and Democrats
alike, have done?
No. They maintain a demure and re-
spectful silence towards the President
on that one. They are not interested in
the President releasing his taxes, but
they want to use the fact that maybe
there is a Federal worker who wasn’t
able to pay his or her taxes as justifica-
tion for not giving America’s Federal
workforce a pay raise. That is quite re-
markable to me, Mr. Speaker.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time to close.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, you have the benefit of
being there in the chair where I used to
get to stand from time to time to pre-
side over these proceedings, and you
know that feeling. You may be a par-
tisan on the weekends when you are at
a Democratic rally, but when you
stand in that chair, you don’t stand
there as a Democrat. I didn’t stand
there as a Republican. You stand there
as the representative of the entire U.S.
House of Representatives to make sure
we have a full, fair, and free debate. In
fact, you have got a wonderful team
there in the Parliamentarian’s and the
Clerk’s Office to make sure that all
goes unaffected from one leadership to
the next.
In fact, we go back hundreds of years
in terms of trying to honor the prece-
dence and the practices that this
Chamber has brought together. We do
that because, when you govern this in-
stitution with that mantra of fair play,
we get better results in the end: we
spend less time arguing about the proc-
ess; we spend more time working to-
gether on progress; and we get to where
it is each and every one of our con-
stituents wants us to go.
My friend from Maryland and I, we
are in a tough trap here in January. Of
all the things I thought we would be
talking about down here as it affects a
Federal employee pay increase, the
President’s conversations about his tax
forms in a campaign 3 years ago wasn’t
one of them.
But somehow, because of the nature
of discourse today, if you have a sharp
stick with the President’s name on it,
you just kind of have to work that in
whenever the debate gives you an op-
portunity. It never once brings us clos-
er to solutions, but it apparently
makes folks feel better from time to
time, makes their constituents feel
better from time to time.
We are going to have to ask ourselves
sometime soon: Did we get elected to
make a point or did we get elected to
make a difference? I know what that
answer is for me, and I want this, Mr.
Speaker, to go down as a missed oppor-
tunity.
This could have been a bill that we
spent our time on the floor talking
through together, as Mr. CONNOLLY and
Mr. MEADOWS did just last night in the
Rules Committee as representatives of
the committee of jurisdiction on this
issue, of all the things we have in com-
mon from coast to coast, from north to
south, as it relates to honoring our
Federal workforce and improving our
Federal workforce.
And, for whatever reason, the leader-
ship decision was made that we
wouldn’t do this in a partnership way,
we wouldn’t do this in a bipartisan
way, we wouldn’t do this in a full-
throated legislative process way, but
we would just craft this bill, drop it on
the floor, and force a vote.
We can miss a couple of opportuni-
ties, Mr. Speaker, to come together.
We have already missed a few in Janu-
ary. We can miss a few more. But I
know my friend from Maryland shares
my concern.
There is going to come a time—and it
happened to Republicans, too—where
you miss one too many opportunities
to work together and you poison that
partnership well for weeks or months
or, in worst case scenarios, even years
to come.
America can’t afford that, Mr.
Speaker, and each and every one of us
is better than that. We haven’t found
our stride yet. If we defeat this rule
today, perhaps that will be a step in
finding our stride. If we defeat the pre-
vious question and consider my amend-
ment, that might be a step in finding
our stride. Even in the absence of those
eventualities, we still must commit
ourselves to one another to find that
stride moving forward.
It is to the disadvantage of every
Federal employee in the Nation to
make this conversation about the im-
portance of the work they do look like
an ‘‘us’’ against ‘‘them.’’ When it
comes to folks who wear a flag on their
shoulder, when it comes to folks who
show up in service of their fellow man,
there is no ‘‘us’’ and ‘‘them’’; there is
just an ‘‘us.’’ Any opportunity we use
to either distort that understanding or
fail to recognize that understanding
does violence to us all.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on
this rule, a ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous
question, and I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
My friend from Georgia eloquently
calls us back to bipartisanship, and I
could not agree more. I would love
nothing more than for him and for all
of our colleagues across the aisle to
join us in supporting the 2.6 percent
pay raise for America’s Federal work-
force.
I almost feel as though, if we were to
add the names of our distinguished col-
leagues on the other side to the bill,
they might support it. So I would re-
open that offer and restate that offer:
We invite everybody to come on and to
be cosponsors with us in giving Amer-
ica’s Federal workforce a pay raise
right now.
But we do have to think about this in
bipartisan-nonpartisan terms.
It was the President of the United
States who maligned the Federal work-
force, apparently, from his perspective,
by calling them Democrats, and there
are two problems with that.
One, it is not true. I have got lots of
Republicans who work as Federal em-
ployees. I have got lots of Independents
who work as Federal employees, as
well as Democrats, as well as Greens,
as well as people who are not affiliated
with any party at all and are probably
sick of a lot of the partisanship that
goes on here in Washington.
Think about what the real problem
with the President deriding Federal
workers as Democrats is. The real
problem is that they are Americans.
We are all Americans. We stand to-
gether as Americans. That is why we
have got to stand behind our Federal
workforce.
I want to just clear up one other
thing that has been bugging me, be-
cause the gentleman from Georgia is so
persuasive in his tactics, and he kind of
mixed apples and oranges.
We are talking about a pay raise for
the workforce, and he said: Well,
maybe most of the workers deserve
one, but there might be some who
don’t.
I just want to state generally what
the procedure is for evaluating Federal
workers. Federal agencies use formal
performance-rating programs for al-
most all of their career employees,
typically with five different levels. The
ratings are used in deciding on pro-
motions, merit pay increases, cash
awards, or discipline.
b 1000
In the most severe cases, low-per-
forming employees can be disciplined
and removed from their jobs.
Now, the gentleman, I am sure, has
some ideas for how we can improve
that system and make it better. By all
means, let’s discuss that, but let’s not
cloud the issue of the fact that our
workers need a raise.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on
the rule.
The material previously referred to

Sec. 4. The amendment referred to in sec-

At the end of the bill, add the following:
SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON RAISE FOR FEDERAL
EMPLOYEE WITH DELINQUENT TAX
DEBT
(a) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any
other provision of law, including any other
provision of this Act, during calendar year
2019 any Federal employee with delinquent
tax debt may not receive a salary increase.
(b) DEFINITION OF DELINQUENT TAX DEBT.—
In this section, the term ‘‘delinquent tax
debt’’—
(1) means a Federal tax liability that—
(A) has been assessed by the Secretary of
the Treasury under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986; and
(B) may be collected by the Secretary by
levy or by a proceeding in court; and

FEDERAL CIVILIAN WORKFORCE
PAY RAISE FAIRNESS ACT OF 2019
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 790.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland?
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 87 and rule
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in
the Committee of the Whole House on
the state of the Union for the consider-
ation of the bill, H.R. 790.
The Chair appoints the gentleman
from the Northern Mariana Islands
(Mr. SABLAN) to preside over the Com-
mittee of the Whole.
b 1042
IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
consideration of the bill (H.R. 790) to
provide for a pay increase in 2019 for
certain civilian employees of the Fed-
eral Government, and for other pur-
poses, with Mr. SABLAN in the chair.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the
bill is considered read the first time.
The gentleman from Maryland (Mr.
CUMMINGS) and the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. MEADOWS) each
will control 30 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Maryland.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, I am proud to be an origi-
nal cosponsor of H.R. 790, the Federal
Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness
Act of 2019, along with my fellow col-
leagues of the local delegation. I pay
special thanks to Chairman CONNOLLY
and Majority Leader HOYER for their
leadership on this very important piece
of legislation.
H.R. 790, as amended, would author-
ize a 2.6 percent pay raise for Federal
civilian workers for 2019, the same
raise that our military servicemembers
are receiving this year.
Historically, Congress has tried to
ensure parity in pay increases between
Federal civilian employees and mili-
tary servicemembers. This bill would
continue this longstanding tradition.
The bill would provide the pay raise
to Federal employees in the competi-
tive and excepted services, blue-collar
workers, members of the career Senior
Executive Service, and employees in
the scientific and senior-level posi-
tions.
The men and women of our civil serv-
ice deserve this small increase in pay
because they have endured so much
during the last several years. They
were subjected, Mr. Chair, to repeated
and unrelenting attacks on their pay
and on their benefits.
b 1045
They have suffered through pay
freezes, hiring freezes, higher pension
costs, and furloughs due to sequestra-
tion and government shutdowns.
Since 2011, Federal workers have con-
tributed nearly $200 billion to help re-
duce our country’s deficit and to fund
other government programs. These
hardworking, dedicated Federal work-
ers include the 800,000 employees who
were furloughed or forced to work
without pay for 35 days during the
longest shutdown in our great Nation’s
history.
The men and women of our civil serv-
ice were held hostage to a political dis-
pute over funding for a border wall
that the President had stated over and
over again would be paid for by Mexico.
There is something wrong with this
picture.
They include members of the Coast
Guard, TSA screeners, Department of
Agriculture workers who help farmers
and ranchers, FAA air traffic control-
lers and safety inspectors, FDA food in-
spectors, the FBI, EPA pollution in-
spectors, Border Patrol agents, and Se-
cret Service agents.
Given all the hardship Federal em-
ployees have experienced, they deserve
a modest pay increase to help make up
for the years of freezes and negligible
increases and to help offset the cost of
inflation.
The pay increase also would help the
Federal Government compete against
the private sector to recruit and retain
highly qualified candidates to serve the
American people.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman
for his words on the importance of
making sure that our Federal work-
force is properly compensated. Indeed,
this is an important subject.
Mr. Chairman, I guess my question
here today is, fundamentally, if it is so
important, then why haven’t we had a
hearing? Why haven’t we had a mark-
up? Why the rush to push this bill on
the floor?
Not too long ago, my good friend
from Maryland, the chairman of the
committee, would be on this same floor
arguing the same thing: Why are we
not having a markup? Why are we not
going through regular order?
Mr. Chairman, I remind this body
that, less than 30 days ago, there was a
vote on the House floor that said we
are going to return to regular order; we
VerDate Sep 11 2014 01:17 Jan 31, 2019 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A30JA7.005 H30JAPT1
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1296 January 30, 2019
are going to make sure that every bill
goes through the committee, has a
markup, and actually has fair debate.
Yet, here we are, less than 30 days
into this new Congress, and we are put-
ting forth a messaging bill that, quite
frankly, has not been vetted. The
amendment process has not come out
of the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form.
I will also say, and this is no laugh-
ing matter, I have been one of the few
Members on our side of the aisle on
this committee who has actively en-
gaged in trying to make sure that our
Federal workforce is not only com-
pensated, but properly recognized.
Mr. Chairman, here is my problem.
According to Federal workers, over 25
percent of them believe that raises do
not happen based on merit, that every-
one gets a raise. Indeed, this bill does
that. It says, regardless of how you per-
form, we are going to give everybody
the same increase.
Now, that same Federal workforce
went even further. One-third of them
said that we don’t do enough to get rid
of poor performers.
What message are we sending to the
Federal workforce here today? We are
rushing a bill that has not gone
through committee. We have not pro-
vided meaningful amendments that are
actually appropriate. We have a Fed-
eral workforce that says they don’t get
raises based on the merits of their
work, on the hard work they put forth.
Indeed, they are saying that a third of
the employees are getting compensated
regardless of their performances.
Now, when we look at that, what
message does this body send to the
Federal workforce? It says that it
doesn’t matter what kind of job you do.
I think that is a terrible message to
send.
I can tell you, Mr. Chairman, as we
look at this bill—and I am sure we will
debate the merits of this particular
piece of legislation—we have the gen-
tleman from Virginia, Mr. CONNOLLY,
here, and the gentleman from Mary-
land, Mr. CUMMINGS, both Members
who I respect greatly. Yet, this rush to
put this messaging bill on the floor
does nothing but damage the under-
lying support that many of us on both
sides of the aisle have for the Federal
workforce.
I strongly object to this particular
measure. Let’s slow it down. Let’s go
through the appropriate time to make
sure that, indeed, we have a markup,
that we have a bill.
The chairman knows full well that
Federal workers, not only in and
around Washington, D.C., but across
the Nation, deserve our full attention,
and this deserves a full debate.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chairman, let me be clear that
there are many Federal workers who
are suffering and who have suffered.
The message that we send to them is
that we care about them, and we know
that they give their blood, sweat, and
tears over and over again. That is one
of the messages we send.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to
the distinguished gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CONNOLLY), the chairman of
our Subcommittee on Government Op-
erations.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I
thank my friend, the distinguished new
chairman of the Committee on Over-
sight and Reform. I am so proud to call
him that.
Mr. Chairman, let me just say, I
heard the arguments from my friend
from North Carolina, and I know he
does care about the Federal employees,
but his arguments ring hollow when
you support a 35-day shutdown of the
Federal Government.
If you believe in regular order, then
you never shut down the Federal Gov-
ernment, nor do you advise the Presi-
dent of the United States to shut down
the Federal Government, nor do you
use shutdowns as a tool to get some
policy goal achieved.
That is never acceptable. It shouldn’t
be acceptable to Washington. It is not
acceptable to the American people. It
certainly is not acceptable to the
800,000 Federal employees and an equal
number of Federal contract employees
and small business owners who were af-
fected negatively by this shutdown.
So it is hard to listen to a lecture
about regular order in the midst of
that wreckage.
That is what we are trying to do
here. It is not a messaging bill to em-
barrass anybody. It is a bill to try to
begin to restore the integrity of re-
spect and dignity to the men and
women who serve this country. They
are called Federal employees. They
were innocent victims of political
games, as if they were pawns, Mr.
Chairman, for a wall. We are just try-
ing to begin the process of making
them whole again.
I thank the majority leader, Mr.
HOYER, for bringing this bill to the
floor. The bill would end the current
freeze for Federal employees, rec-
ommended by President Trump, and
provide hardworking civil servants
with a 2.6 percent pay increase, match-
ing that for military employees.
On the heels of this largest govern-
ment shutdown in U.S. history, and the
longest, I believe it is appropriate for
the House of Representatives to take
up this legislation to make a state-
ment in the people’s body that we do
respect the work of our civil servants
and our Federal employees and that we
are prepared to provide concrete meas-
ures to do that.
During the shutdown, some of these
individuals reported to work without
knowing when, or if, they would re-
ceive their next paycheck, while others
were willing to work, but were told
they couldn’t.
Even though the Federal Government
has reopened, most Federal employees
are still waiting to receive that first
paycheck. Under statute, Federal em-
ployees should have received a 2.1 per-
cent pay increase for 2019. Instead, the
recommendation from the White House
was zero.
This bill represents a pay increase for
Federal employees above that statu-
tory level equal to an additional 0.5
percent over and above the statutory
level that would have otherwise been
provided.
While the House of Representatives
passed appropriations bills that in-
cluded a 1.9 percent pay increase for
Federal employees, the continuing res-
olution agreed to by the House and
Senate did not reverse the President’s
pay freeze. This bill would.
Historically, Congress has tried to
ensure parity in pay between Federal
civilian employees and military serv-
icemembers. This bill would continue
the tradition of pay parity for which I
have advocated since I came to Con-
gress 10 years ago.
A Federal employee pay increase of
2.6 percent is, in my view, further justi-
fied, as the distinguished chairman of
the committee pointed out, by the
hardships just suffered and those suf-
fered over the last 10 years: three pay
freezes, hiring freezes, compensation
cuts, and benefit cuts. Federal employ-
ees are the only group on the planet
that actually has contributed nearly
$200 billion to deficit reduction.
In 9 of the last 10 years, Congress has
failed to enact an increase in basic pay
consistent with the statute. Not true
on the military side. That is why we
are trying to have pay parity.
In 8 of the last 10 years, basic pay in-
creases trailed increases in the cost of
living itself.
I will point out that the legislation
in front of us has been endorsed by the
American Federation of Government
Employees; the National Treasury Em-
ployees Union; the American Federa-
tion of State, County and Municipal
Employees; the International Federa-
tion of Professional and Technical En-
gineers; the Senior Executives Associa-
tion; the Federal Managers Associa-
tion; and the Professional Managers
Association.
Mr. Chairman, I include in the
RECORD letters of support from these
groups.
AMERICAN FEDERATION OF
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, AFL–CIO,
January 29, 2019.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the
American Federation of Government Em-
ployees, AFL–CIO (AFGE), which represents
more than 700,000 federal and District of Co-
lumbia government employees within 70
agencies, I write urging you to support H.R.
790, the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay
Raise Fairness Act of 2019, introduced by
Representative Connolly (D-VA), when it
comes to the floor this week. This legislation
provides federal workers with a FY 2019 pay
adjustment of 2.6 percent. This modest ad-
justment would allow federal employees to
make up some of the purchasing power they
lost over the last decade and restore the long
tradition of parity in the rate of adjustment
for civilian and military employees of the
United States government.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1297
January 30, 2019
January 25, 2019 marked the end of our na-
tion’s longest government shutdown, and
federal employees have been without a pay-
check since December 21st. As a result of the
funding lapse, many federal employees have
fallen behind on their monthly bills and are
experiencing serious financial hardship. Al-
though some federal employees make more,
among AFGE’s own membership, the average
take home pay is just $500 per week after
they pay their taxes, health insurance pre-
miums, and mandatory retirement contribu-
tions. Many federal employees were strug-
gling to make ends meet before the shut-
down, and H.R. 790 would not only help agen-
cies recruit new employees, and retain a
workforce battered by the shutdown, com-
pensation cuts enacted in the wake of the
2008 financial crisis, it would also dem-
onstrate that the Congress values the federal
workforce’s dedication and commitment to
serving the American public.
For decades, Congress supported pay ad-
justment parity between federal and mili-
tary employees. The civilian workforce not
only works alongside the warfighters to keep
our nation safe, they are also public servants
who have dedicated their lives to providing
the American public with invaluable benefits
services. Federal employees work across the
country securing our borders, keeping trav-
elers safe, providing benefits to the elderly
and disabled, caring for our veterans, and
keeping our air and water safe and clean. Un-
fortunately, in recent years pay adjustment
parity has not been upheld and federal civil-
ian salaries have continued to lag standards
set by private employers. H.R. 790 would help
narrow this gap.
As you work to pass legislation to fund the
remaining seven appropriations bills, AFGE
urges you to support H.R. 790 when it comes
to the floor this week, and we strongly urge
you to support inclusion of a 2.6 percent fed-
eral employee pay adjustment in the final
funding measure for FY 2019.
Sincerely,
J. DAVID COX, SR.,
National President.
THE NATIONAL TREASURY
EMPLOYEES UNION,
January 29, 2019.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the
National Treasury Employees Union, which
represents over 150,000 federal employees in
33 agencies, I urge you to support H.R. 790,
the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise
Fairness Act of 2019, which would provide
federal workers a 2.6 percent pay increase for
2019 and ensure pay parity with the military,
with whom they frequently work in service
to the nation.
At the end of August, the President sent a
letter to Congress reiterating the call in his
Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget Request for a
pay freeze for federal workers. If not for the
President’s decision to implement a pay
freeze, the Federal Employee Pay Com-
parability Act (5 USC 5303) indicates that
federal employees should receive a 2.1 per-
cent pay raise in January 2019, prior to any
amount being provided for locality pay rate
increases. This formula is designed to ensure
that the gap between federal government and
private sector wages does not further dete-
riorate. According to the most recent Fed-
eral Pay Agent Report, the current pay dis-
parity is over 30 percent.
Like all American workers and middle-
class taxpayers, federal employees face ever-
increasing costs of living, with rising utility,
health care and food bills, along with school
loan and rent or mortgage obligations. Due
to a three-year pay freeze and five subse-
quent years of below-market pay raises that
were lower than the amounts called for
under current law, federal employees have
seen their wages fall further behind the pri-
vate sector, which has adversely impacted
them and their families.
Moreover, if the federal government is to
have the ability to compete with the private
sector in recruiting and retaining a skilled
workforce, it is essential that the federal
government provide its workers a pay in-
crease. The federal government relies on
qualified and professional civil servants that
live and work in every state and congres-
sional district across the country to carry
out our nation’s laws and programs, pro-
viding critical services for our nation and
the American people.
Now, after suffering through a 35–day shut-
down that caused unimaginable hardship for
hundreds of thousands of federal workers,
their families, and their communities, it is
important to ensure that employees are able
to afford the increased fees and penalties
that they suffered as a result. All federal em-
ployees deserve an adequate pay raise and we
urge your support for H.R. 790 in apprecia-
tion for their service.
Sincerely,
ANTHONY M. REARDON,
National President.
AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE,
COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOY-
EES, AFL–CIO,
Washington, DC, January 29, 2019.
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the
members of the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees
(AFSCME), including thousands of federal
government employees, I write to strongly
support the ‘‘Federal Civilian Workforce Pay
Raise Fairness Act of 2019,’’ H.R. 790, which
would increase federal employee salaries for
calendar year 2019 by 2.6 percent. AFSCME
urges you to vote for this bill to demonstrate
your support for America’s dedicated and
hardworking federal workers.
A salary increase is necessary because ex-
pert analysis demonstrates that when con-
trasted position by position, federal workers’
wages lag below employees in the nonfederal
sector—both in the private sector and in
state and local governments. In fact, federal
employees are significantly underpaid in nu-
merous occupations. Furthermore, since
2010, as a direct result of congressional legis-
lation that reduced pay and benefits, federal
employees have had their compensation cut
by more than $180 billion (over 10 years).
Congress should take action to reverse these
cuts and close this pay gap.
To recruit, hire, and retain a qualified ca-
pable federal government workforce, Amer-
ica must pay competitive salaries. This is
vital to continue attracting the best and
brightest to our public service. Unfortu-
nately, during the last two years, the federal
government’s hiring freeze and shutdowns
have lowered morale, forced many federal
employees to cover others employees’ job re-
sponsibilities, and reduced the federal gov-
ernment’s effectiveness. H.R. 790 would help
address these challenges and move us for-
ward.
AFSCME endorses this important legisla-
tion and urges you to vote for the ‘‘Federal
Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act
of 2019,’’ H.R. 790.
Sincerely,
SCOTT FREY,
Director of Federal Government Affairs.
INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF PRO-
FESSIONAL & TECHNICAL ENGI-
NEERS,
January 29, 2019.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the
90,000 represented members of the Inter-
national Federation of Professional and
Technical Engineers (IFPTE), we are writing
regarding the Federal Civilian Workforce
Pay Raise Fairness Act of 2019 ((HR 790), leg-
islation sponsored by Virginia Congressman
Gerry Connolly that is scheduled for full
House consideration this week. After the
longest government shutdown in the history
of the United States, which impacted some
800,000 federal workers and their families,
IFPTE is urging you to support pay parity
between military and civilian workers by
voting in support of this bill.
After three consecutive years of pay
freezes, followed by meager across-the-board
adjustments, federal workers have seen their
incomes decrease by nearly 15% with respect
to inflation over the last eight years. There-
fore, IFPTE feels it is both fiscally respon-
sible and reflective of the income sacrificed
by federal employees to adopt the long-
standing practice of pay parity between ci-
vilian workers and the military by sup-
porting HR 790 calling for a 2.6% federal pay
increase.
As Congress works to negotiate an accept-
able solution to pass the remaining FY19 ap-
propriations bills, IFPTE urges that what-
ever action is taken—whether it be a Con-
tinuing Resolution (CR) or a full FY19 Mini-
bus that includes all or some of the seven
outstanding spending measures, we believe
that quickly approving a 2.6% civilian pay
raise is more than reasonable. This number
is reflective of pay parity with the military
pay raise approved last year as a part of the
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)
and is reflective of the many years of sac-
rifices made by federal workers, including
enduring a senseless 35-day government
shutdown.
IFPTE does recognize the acute difficulties
facing Congress in these contentious times,
but we simply ask that the men and women
who work hard every day in the trenches to
deliver excellence for the taxpayer not be
harmed any more than they already have by
the political turmoil in Washington.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
PAUL SHEARON,
President.

H.R. 790, the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay
Raise Fairness Act of 2019.
For the past decade the federal workforce
has been treated as the nation’s piggy bank,
with nearly $200 billion in pay and benefits
being taken for debt reduction and other
purposes. Providing all civilian federal em-
ployees with a 2.6% raise in 2019, especially
following the shutdown, is an important step
to ensure the government can attract and re-
tain the talent it needs to serve the Amer-
ican public in a competitive labor market.
Moreover, reestablishing pay parity with the
uniformed services is applauded and wel-
comed.
This legislation sends a signal that Con-
gress is serious about ensuring the federal

government is an employer of choice. For
too long race-to-the-bottom policies related
to the federal workforce have become the
norm. It is our hope that the silver lining of
the shutdown is that the American people
now better understand what government
does for them every day, how dedicated the
professionals who work for them in the gov-
ernment are, and that Congress and the ad-
ministration will find ways to work together
to ensure our federal government has the
personnel, tools, and resources necessary to
fulfil the duties assigned to it.
SEA is deeply concerned that neglect of
federal workforce capabilities in recent
years have resulted in an increased risk of
government failure, as outlined in a paper we
released last week. Strengthening the Senior
Executive Service (SES) and civil service
and advocating for cultivation of the public
service leadership profession are among our
top organizational priorities in the 116th
Congress. I hope that passage of this legisla-
tion is just the beginning of concerted efforts
to modernize and strengthen our civil serv-
ice, to bring data-driven approaches to man-
agement and compensation, and much more.
Thank you for your steadfast support of
our federal workforce and your leadership on
this issue.

FEDERAL MANAGERS ASSOCIATION,
Alexandria, VA, January 29, 2019.
Hon. GERRY CONNOLLY,
Washington, DC.
DEAR CONGRESSMAN CONNOLLY: On behalf of
the managers and supervisors currently serv-
ing our nation in the federal government and
whose interests are represented by the Fed-
eral Managers Association (FMA), we extend
our strongest support for your bill, the Fed-
eral Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness
Act of 2019 (H.R. 790). This legislation pro-
vides a much-deserved 2.6 percent pay raise
for 2019, and addresses the inequity federal
employees faced in recent years due to pay
freezes and minimal raises.
The federal workforce ensures the safety of
our borders, protects the nation’s food sup-
ply, cares for our elderly and veterans, and
serves alongside our military forces. But the
minimal increases in pay received do not re-
flect the duties of these dedicated workers.
It is time for the federal workforce to be rec-
ognized for their dedication to serving our
country at home and abroad, and your legis-
lation does that.
In addition to providing fair wages to fed-
eral employees, FMA believes H.R. 790 will
help to combat the problem of morale, re-
cruitment, and retention in the federal gov-
ernment, particularly in the aftermath of
the partial government shutdown. As the
federal government continues to struggle
with these issues, your bill is a step towards
offering competitive salaries, attracting and
keeping the brightest and best to the federal
workforce. By calling for wages that fairly
compensate the abilities and responsibilities
of the federal workforce, you recognize the
need to ensure a fully engaged federal work-
force that remains dedicated to serving the
nation.
Thank you for your continued support of
our federal workforce.

DEAR MAJORITY LEADER HOYER AND REP-
RESENTATIVE CONNOLLY: On behalf of the Pro-
fessional Managers Association—the non-
profit professional association that has,
since 1981, represented professional man-
agers, management officials, and non-bar-
gaining unit employees at the Internal Rev-
enue Service (IRS)—I write to endorse H.R.
790 the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise
Fairness Act of 2019.
Pay parity between federal civilian em-
ployees and members of the military has
long been the norm, until recent years in
which the federal workforce has been faced
with constant attacks that have taken bil-
lions in earned pay and benefits out of the
pockets of hardworking middle class Ameri-
cans. The result of abandoning pay parity
has been an ever-growing imbalance between
the compensation of federal workers and the
broader labor market.
In a highly competitive economy in which
the types of skills and abilities the govern-
ment needs are in high demand across the
board, this legislation providing a 2.6% pay
increase across the board to federal civilian
employees can help begin to close the gap.
Especially on the heels of the embarrassing
35-day government shutdown, it is important
for Congress to ensure the government is a
competitive employer with good pay and
benefits offerings.
Thank you for your leadership on this
issue, and for your steadfast support of our
federal workforce.
Sincerely,
THOMAS R. BURGER,
Executive Director,

The CHAIR. The time of the gen-
tleman has expired.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I
yield an additional 1 minute to the
gentleman from Virginia.
Mr. CONNOLLY. The bottom line,
Mr. Chairman, is that our Federal civil
servants are like any other workforce.
More than 900,000 of those Federal em-
ployees earn less than $60,000 a year.
They are not rich. They are not living
high on the hog. They deserve and need
this adjustment, especially after the
longest, most reckless shutdown of the
government in American history.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, I
yield such time as he may consume to
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN),
my good friend, the ranking member of
the committee, and a champion for the
American people.
b 1100
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentleman from North Carolina for his
hard work on the committee and in the
United States Congress.
There are just a couple of key things
to keep in mind. I am against this bill.
The average yearly pay for a govern-
ment worker is $85,000. CBO did a
study. Those with college degrees who
work in the Federal Government make
21 percent more than people with col-
lege degrees in the private sector;
those without a college degree, 53 per-
cent more than those in the private
sector.
Think about what this bill says. All
of those hardworking taxpayers in the
private sector, hey, you are already
making less, but now you are going to
have more of your tax dollars go to pay
people—who are already making more
money than you—to get a raise. How is
that fair?
Even worse, think about what the
Democrats are doing on H.R. 1, their
signature legislation. H.R. 1, they are
saying to those same people who are al-
ready making more money than folks
in the private sector, they are saying
to those private-sector taxpayers, Hey,
guess what? We are not only going to
give them a raise, even though they are
already making more than you, we are
going to give them 6 paid days to work
on campaigns, 6 vacation days where
they get to work on campaigns. And,
oh, by the way, they may be helping
the very candidate you are against.
Such a deal for the taxpayers.
That is why I am a ‘‘no’’ on this bill.
I am thinking about the taxpayers in
the 11th District of North Carolina, the
Fourth District of Ohio, and all across
this country. Tell me how that is fair.
Oh, I forgot. There is one more thing
the Democrats want to do. H.R. 1, they
want to make election day a paid holi-
day for Federal employees. This is not
where we need to be. This is not the re-
spect taxpayers deserve.
Mr. Chair, I would urge a ‘‘no’’ vote,
and I appreciate the good work Con-
gressman MEADOWS is doing on this
legislation. Frankly, he is right. We
probably should have had a hearing and
talked about this. Maybe the Demo-
crats didn’t want to talk about the fact
that people in the private sector are
making less with the same kind of edu-
cation than those who work for the
Federal Government.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), our distinguished
majority leader.
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chair, I am, of
course, not shocked that those who
wanted to shut down the government
and keep it shut had Federal employees
making nothing. I am not shocked that
they don’t want to give Federal em-
ployees a cost-of-living adjustment.
Now, I could spend a lot of time re-
sponding to my friend from Ohio about
the qualifications necessary to run
NASA and to work at NASA, or the
FBI, or the CDC, or the other agencies
that require high levels of skill to
work.
I am sure my friend from Ohio has
read the government reports from the
council that is charged with the re-
sponsibility of determining whether we
are paying comparable wages who say,
no, we are not. As a matter of fact, we
are substantially under, if you compare
apples to apples, educational require-
ments, and skills requirements to the
private sector, similar requirements.
He doesn’t mention that because the
averages, they sound just much better.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1299
January 30, 2019
Now, of course, the average salary on
the Washington National’s team is a
little higher than that. Why, because
their skill levels are higher than al-
most anybody else in the country.
Mr. Chair, I want to thank Rep-
resentative CONNOLLY and Representa-
tive WEXTON for their hard work, and I
want to thank my friend, the chairman
of the committee. Representative CON-
NOLLY, of course, has been a long-time
advocate of the pay and benefits, and
retaining, and being able to recruit
people who have those kinds of skill
levels.
You better be careful; some 30 to 40
percent of our people are getting pretty
close or are at retirement age, and
they are going to say, you keep shut-
ting them down and not keeping their
salary level, unlike our salary, which
has deteriorated now for 10 years in
terms of its purchasing value. But
averages are averages.
I want to thank my colleagues, Mr.
CONNOLLY in particular. He has been an
outstanding advocate for many Federal
civilian employees living and working
in northern Virginia and across the na-
tional capital region, and, indeed,
around the country.
Let me disclose, I represent 62,000
Federal employees. You are not
shocked that I am for Federal employ-
ees. But when I was in the State Sen-
ate, I represented a miniscule amount
of State employees, and I was for pay-
ing them comparable wages so that we
could hire competent, capable, com-
mitted people to serve my constitu-
ents.
This shutdown just showed what kind
of pain it has caused. Do you think
those high-price people were in food
lines because they wanted to say: I am
in a food line? No, sir. They were there
because they were not making enough
in the Washington metropolitan area
and in other areas around the country,
because less than 20 percent of the Fed-
eral employees live in this Washington
metropolitan area.
The pay freeze President Trump im-
posed on Federal workers has been det-
rimental to our ability as a nation to
recruit and retain the best and bright-
est citizens to serve in government.
Now, very frankly, Abe Pollin, a very
good friend of mine, owned the Wash-
ington Wizards. He never asked me to
play center because I have a disability.
I am 6-feet tall, not 7-feet tall. That is
all. And the people he asked, he had to
pay a lot of money to them because he
wouldn’t get them if he didn’t.
The people who were running our
space program, or running NIH, they
are just not run-of-the-mill people,
frankly, like me. They have got ex-
traordinary skills. If we keep shutting
them down and we keep not paying
them, you are going to have a second-
rate government. That is where you
are going.
You are going to have another oppor-
tunity to say shutdown is stupid. I
hope you join us on that because it is
stupid. It cost us $11 billion according
to CBO. After 5 weeks of an unneces-
sary, costly, and painful shutdown, the
American people have been reminded
how critical the work our Federal em-
ployees perform is to our national se-
curity and economic security.
Americans were horrified to learn
that many civilian Federal employees
live paycheck to paycheck, as they do.
Even a single month’s delay of income
sent many of them to food pantries and
in search of emergency loans.
That isn’t right. We had, for a long
time, an agreement. We do parity for
our military personnel. Now we pay
our military, who we put at the point
of the spear, hazardous duty pay, as we
should. But our agreement was we are
going to make sure that everybody
keeps their pay at pretty much a stable
level of purchasing power. That is the
key.
Very frankly, some people in this
House are not for raising the minimum
wage. The minimum wage has eroded 40
percent in purchasing power since 1968.
The Federal employee pay will erode in
purchasing power if we don’t pass this
legislation.
Let’s not forget that 85 percent of
Federal employees live outside the
Washington area in some of your dis-
tricts; even in North Carolina.
Those who work hard to keep our
country and its people safe deserve to
be paid competitively. This does not
bring them to competitive pay with the
private sector, I tell my friends.
I am proud to represent, as I said,
62,000 of them. I have met many of
them over the years. They are wonder-
ful people dedicated to serving the Na-
tion and the people of our country.
They deserve better than to be treated
like pawns in political games with
shutdowns and pay freezes.
Now, the Senate included 1.9 percent.
We included zero over here, of course,
not surprising. When you don’t respect
people, you don’t necessarily have to
treat them as you would treat an em-
ployee in your own firm.
Federal civilian employees, unlike
their counterparts in the military,
have been asked to contribute $182 bil-
lion over the last 10 years in reduced
benefits and pay. $182 billion they have
contributed to try to bring down our
debt, which is sort of a drop in the
bucket when you give yourself $1.5 tril-
lion for some of the wealthiest people
in America.
You give yourself headroom to create
$1.5 trillion to $2.5 trillion of additional
debt to give some of the wealthiest
people in America a huge tax cut, but
not 2.6 percent for Federal employees.
My no.
That scientist at NASA or the FBI
agent who has maybe a college degree,
maybe a law degree, who has to figure
out what some of the most dangerous
people in America and around the
world are doing, no, not 2.6 percent for
them.
Mr. Chair, we need to make sure pay
is keeping pace with the rising cost of
living for those who serve this country
in civilian roles, as well as those in
military roles. They are no less deserv-
ing of our gratitude and fair compensa-
tion. This bill would ensure that civil-
ian Federal employees receive the
same 2.6 percent that all of you voted
for on that side of the aisle for our
military personnel.
I honor our military personnel. We
should give them that. We should make
sure their purchasing power doesn’t
erode. And by the way, you can talk to
military families who also from time
to time are in food lines. Is that the
right way to treat our people who work
for our country and our constituents?
I urge my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle to join us in supporting this
bill. In doing so, we can show the hard-
working men and women—unlike we
showed them for 35 days—that we do
have respect for them; that we do care
about their morale; and that we do
care about their ability to support
themselves and their families. We can
show them that we value their con-
tributions and thank them for their
important service.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues, at a
time of extraordinary trauma among
our Federal employees, to show them
the gratitude and respect that they
have earned and that they deserve.
The CHAIR. Members are reminded
to address their remarks to the Chair.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I am glad the Chairman made this
admonishment because some of the
comments that were just offered actu-
ally seemed to be directed at me from
a standpoint of respect. I would remind
the gentleman from Maryland, both
gentlemen from Maryland, that this is
one of the individuals who has actually
worked in a bipartisan fashion on TPS
and a number of things. The majority
leader knows that well.
I would also say if we are going to
make broad-sweeping statements that
impugn the motives of individuals, it
needs to start with the previous Presi-
dent of the United States, Barack
Obama, because he froze the Federal
workforce at zero three different times.
I didn’t hear the outrage on this
floor, Mr. Chairman, that I am hearing
today. It is somehow always one side of
the aisle’s fault, unless it happens to be
their party’s President that invokes
the freeze.
So I would say, Mr. Chairman, we
need to make sure that those broad-
brush characterizations are not con-
veyed here on the House floor.
Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman
yield on the point he just made?
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chair, I respect-
fully yield to the gentleman from
Maryland.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentleman very much because he
makes a good point. When President
Obama became President, of course, we
were in a deep trough as the gentleman
remembers.

It was January of 2009, and we sat

Federal employees ought to get no cost-of-

I supported the second year of not

COLA while so many people in the
country were struggling without a job
and losing their homes. So I just want-
ed to tell the gentleman that when a
Democrat was President of the United
States, I told the Federal unions—all of
whom supported me—Look, the coun-
try is in trouble.
But we are not in trouble now. The
President talks about what a great
economy we have and what low unem-
ployment we have. So now is the time
to give them that raise.
Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gen-
tleman for yielding.
Mr. MEADOWS. I appreciate the gen-
tleman, but I want to make sure, Mr.
Chairman, we correct the record be-
cause the gentleman is correct in 2009
and 2010. But we gave them raises in
2010. The Federal pay freezes were 2011,
‘12, and ‘13 when the same President
was saying that everything was going
fine. So I want to remind the gen-
tleman that if we are going to look at
history, then I think—to use the gen-
tleman’s words—let’s not use revi-
sionist history.
Mr. HOYER. I didn’t support him,
however, when he did those zeros in
those years when we were doing well.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, I am
going to direct it to you. The same
gentleman who is making the argu-
ment here today was not on the House
floor talking about how evil the Presi-
dent was and how he should not be
doing that. So I just want to make sure
we correct the record here today.
Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
Ohio (Mr. JORDAN).
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Chairman, I have
the utmost respect for the majority
leader. In his comments he said that
the shutdown is painful and stupid.
No one wants a shutdown, Mr. Chair-
man, but I will tell you what is stupid.
What is stupid is a southern border
that is not secure. I feel for the Federal
employees who missed a paycheck. We
don’t want any family to have to go
through that, and I understand that.
But I also understand the pain that
some families across this country have
suffered, particularly when they lose a
loved one because an illegal immigrant
is here and took the life of someone
they cared deeply about.
This shutdown would have never hap-
pened if the Democrats would have
voted for what they were for before,
what they had already supported. But
no, no, no, they are so focused on stop-
ping the President that they can’t get
focused on helping the country.
Everybody knows we need a border
security wall. All you have to do, Mr.
Chairman, is watch the caravan phe-
nomena over the last several months.
There is another one forming. Until we
understand this and are willing to deal
with the problem, we can keep having
these debates, but I just wish Demo-
crats would support what they did pre-
viously, support money for the border
security wall that everybody knows
needs to happen. That is the real prob-
lem here.
Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman
for yielding.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Let me make it clear, Mr. Chairman:
this is not about a border wall. This is
about building people and allowing
them to sustain themselves.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to
the gentleman from New York (Mr.
JEFFRIES), who is the very distin-
guished leader of our caucus.
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the distinguished chairman for
yielding and for his tremendous leader-
ship on behalf of the hardworking Fed-
eral employees who serve this Nation
in such a tremendous fashion.
I rise today in strong support of this
legislation which will provide a modest
and well-deserved cost-of-living in-
crease for the Federal workforce.
For 35 days, this administration
recklessly shut down the government
so it could try to fund a campaign ap-
plause line. For 35 days, this adminis-
tration shut down the government and
held hardworking employees hostage
using them like bargaining chips from
a bankrupt casino. For 35 days, hun-
dreds of thousands of Federal employ-
ees were furloughed, putting their well-
being in jeopardy.
For 35 days, members of the Coast
Guard, air traffic controllers, TSA
agents, FBI agents, Border Patrol
agents, Secret Service agents, and so
many others were forced to work with-
out pay in the wealthiest country in
the history of the world. For 35 days,
these hardworking Federal employees
across the country from north to south
to east to west stepped up for us. Now
it is time for this Congress to step up
for them.
Over the last 2 years, my colleagues
on the other side of the aisle have
spent their time working on behalf of
the wealthy, the well-off, and the well-
connected. That is the only way, Mr.
Chairman, that you can explain jam-
ming a reckless tax scam down the
throats of the American people where
83 percent of the benefits went to the
wealthiest 1 percent.
House Democrats will spend our time
fighting for working families, middle
class folks, senior citizens, the poor,
the sick, the afflicted, and veterans
from all across this country, many of
whom, by the way, are part of the Fed-
eral workforce. We are going to con-
tinue to stand up for them.
We promised the American people
that we would increase pay for every-
day Americans. Keeping that promise
begins today. Day after day, week after
week, and month after month we will
continue to do everything possible as
we fight hard for the people.
Mr. Chairman, I strongly support
this legislation, and I urge my col-
leagues to do the same. I thank the dis-
tinguished chair and this wonderful
committee for their great work.
Mr. CUMMINGS. I reserve the bal-
ance of my time, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, may I
inquire as to how much time I have re-
maining.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. CÁRDENAS).
The gentleman from North Carolina
has 181⁄2 minutes remaining. The gen-
tleman from Maryland has 151⁄2 min-
utes remaining.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, be-
fore I make some statements, I would
notify the gentleman from Maryland,
my good friend, Mr. CUMMINGS, that I
have no additional speakers on this
particular topic, so I am prepared to
close at any time he would like to do
so.
Mr. Chairman, I will continue to re-
serve the balance of my time based on
the speakers the gentleman might
have.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Let me say this, Mr. Chairman. Yes-
terday we had our organizational meet-
ing, and I made it clear that the distin-
guished gentleman from North Caro-
lina has been truly a person who has
worked very hard in a bipartisan way
trying to come up with commonsense
resolutions. So in no way do I want the
gentleman to feel as if that is not being
recognized, and we appreciate it.
It is just that we have a lot of em-
ployees who aren’t making those very
high salaries. They are the ones who
are living from paycheck to paycheck.
Mr. Chairman, one of the saddest
parts is when they go from paycheck to
paycheck it is almost like no check be-
cause when they look at their bills, the
bills are so much higher than their net
pay. All we are trying to do is make
sure that they keep up with the cost of
living.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from Massachusetts
(Mr. LYNCH), who is the distinguished
chairman of our Subcommittee on Na-
tional Security.
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the chairman for yielding.
I do agree that the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. MEADOWS) has
tried mightily to work with us on var-
ious issues. He is not a bad man, he is
just wrong on this one issue, in my
opinion.
First of all, I rise in support of this
very, very modest cost-of-living in-
crease for Federal workers.
My wife has a habit of reminding me
from time to time. She says: When we

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1301
January 30, 2019
first met, you were an ironworker.
Then you went to law school and be-
came a lawyer. Then you ran for office
and became a politician. You know, it
has been one disappointment after an-
other.
But I want to say, as an ironworker
I was in a much better position than
our Federal workers. When I was an
ironworker—and I eventually became
president of the union—if my job was
unsafe or if the employer refused to
pay my workers, as a union president,
I would pull my men and women off the
job. Under Taft-Hartley 1947, we
changed that law for Federal workers,
everybody in the Federal Government.
We said, ironically, that these jobs are
so important that we can’t have the
government shut down. We can’t have
the government shut down.
So even though we have a President
now in the White House who not only
shut the job down, forced the workers
to work without pay, and then—that
was on the 22nd of December—on the
28th of December he signs an executive
order that says no pay increase for all
of 2019 for our Federal workers.
I want to point out that the TSA
workers—whom we walk by at least
twice a week as we come and go from
Washington—their base starting salary
is $28,000 a year—$28,000 a year. I made
more money than that when I was an
apprentice boy for the ironworkers
back in 1972—$28,000 a year. This would
represent a $27-a-week cost-of-living
adjustment for those workers.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentleman has expired.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I
yield the gentleman from Massachu-
setts an additional 1 minute.
Mr. LYNCH. In Taft-Hartley we said
that as a government we were taking
away the right of workers to strike. As
an ironworker, I put my tools down if
I thought it was unsafe or if somebody
cut my pay. We don’t allow Federal
workers to do that.
I am saying that this President has
broken that covenant of treating our
workers with respect. I think it is only
fair that we consider giving back the
right to strike to our Federal workers.
Let them stand up for themselves and
protest like we give every other human
being in our society. Give them the
right to protest. Give them the right to
strike if we are not going to treat them
right.
I think that, unfortunately, we have
come to this point. I certainly want to
urge my colleagues to vote in favor of
this very modest cost-of-living adjust-
ment on behalf of our Federal workers.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished
gentlewoman from the District of Co-
lumbia (Ms. NORTON).
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chairman, I thank
my good friend, the new chairman of
our committee, for yielding to me.
Mr. Chairman, this tiny—I will call it
modest—2.6 percent pay raise author-
ized by H.R. 790 does not begin to make
up for the long overdue pay raise our
Federal workers are due. It does not
begin to make up for the puny raises—
sometimes as low as 1 percent, some-
times no raise at all—that our Federal
workers have had to bear, and it cer-
tainly does not make up for 35 days of
no pay for the longest shutdown in
American history.
It is particularly unconscionable to
follow the Trump shutdown with a
Trump pay freeze. Every Member in
this House represents Federal workers.
Every Member should be on the floor
speaking for them.
For years, Congress recognized pay
increase equity between civilian and
military personnel. But perhaps with
the disparagement of Federal workers
by Republicans and Republican Presi-
dents, and perhaps to save money, we
no longer even try to bring together
these two parts of our workforce. It is
hard to justify bifurcation of the civil-
ian from the military workforce today.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I
yield the gentlewoman from the Dis-
trict of Columbia an additional 1
minute.
Ms. NORTON. For example, what
about the many who work side by side
such as the civil servants who guard
our borders who are hardly different
from the soldiers who do the same
thing around the country?
The 2.6 percent pay raise proposed
here does not begin to make up for the
32 percent average difference between
Federal and private-sector employees
who do the same work according to the
council that measures this work every
year. But for now, after 35 days of no
pay, now is the time to try to insinuate
some fairness into pay for Federal
workers with this modest 2 percent pay
raise.
b 1130
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
We hear a lot of discussion today on
what is reasonable and small amounts.
In fact, the pay raise that they are
talking about is about $5.5 billion a
year or $55 billion over 10. Actually,
CBO would probably score it higher
than that, closer to $60 billion over 10
years. Yet this whole shutdown that we
are talking about could have been
solved with a compromise between zero
and $5.7 billion for a wall.
So it was an extreme amount of
money when we are talking about se-
curing families, securing our borders,
and protecting our communities. It was
a price too high to pay. But now, all of
a sudden, it is not too high of a price to
pay because it is a small amount of
money? I fail to see the logic, Mr.
Chairman.
When we are looking at this, if we
are really talking about compromises,
where was the compromise over the
last 35 days? There was zero money for
a wall on day one. There was zero
money for a wall on day 35. Yet, here
today, we are talking about $5 billion
or $6 billion as if it were pocket
change.
I find that interesting, Mr. Chair-
man, because, as we look at this par-
ticular issue, my friends on the oppo-
site side of the aisle would have the
American people think that it is only
the Republicans who are totally re-
sponsible for everything. Yet we know
that history shows that, when there
was a Democrat in the White House, in-
deed, there was a pay freeze 3 different
years.
We also know that there were two
votes during the economic and finan-
cial meltdown in 2008 and 2009 where
they gave Federal workers a 3 percent
increase while everybody else was out
looking for a job. Now, where is the
parity in that?
The last question I would have for
you, Mr. Chairman, is this: Where is
the parity, when we look at our mili-
tary men and women’s faces, when we
start talking about 2.6, that they are
getting the same amount? They are not
getting the same amount. Talk to a
chief master sergeant who has been on
the job for 15 years. He is getting far
less pay than the Federal worker who
is getting this same increase when you
have over 25 percent of the Federal
workforce making over $100,000 a year.
We hear all these statistics that are
low statistics, but let’s at least be hon-
est in our debate. When we look at
what we have, if this is a small amount
of money, I guess I would challenge my
colleagues on the opposite side: Let’s
find a compromise on border security
measures.
What amount of money is proper to
save families from losing loved ones? I
have looked in the faces of angel moms
and angel dads, where they have lost
their kids. Are we going to just turn
our back on them as well?
Perhaps there is a spirit of com-
promise here where we can work to-
gether and find a compromise where
there are no more shutdowns. Let’s
look at passing a bill that freezes con-
gressional pay if there is a shutdown. I
am all in. Are all the Democrats in?
Let’s look at it, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Today we are zeroing in on Federal
workers whose average pay is $60,000.
We are zeroing in on folks who are, in
many instances, barely making it.
I don’t want us to get it twisted. We
have a situation where a lot of times
we discuss a whole lot of other things
but don’t necessarily concentrate on
the subject matter at hand.
Yesterday, Mr. Chairman, in our
committee, we had a lady who came in
and told us that her daughter died. She
died because she couldn’t get $333
worth of insulin a month. That hap-
pened in America.
What is my point? These dollars
mean a lot to these Federal employees.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1302 January 30, 2019
I am not going to pit our military
against our civilian employees. They
are all very important. I want them all
to be well paid. But right now, we need
to concentrate on, again, building peo-
ple and making a difference in their
lives.
Speaking of building people, Mr.
Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the dis-
tinguished gentlewoman from Virginia
(Ms. WEXTON), a cosponsor of this bill.
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Chair, I thank my
colleague, GERRY CONNOLLY, for his
strong leadership on this issue.
I rise in strong support of H. Res. 790
and in strong support of a long-overdue
cost-of-living increase for Federal civil
servants.
Many will remember the President’s
callous executive order of December 30,
right in the middle of the shutdown,
freezing Federal workers’ salaries
while hundreds of thousands of them
were furloughed or, worse, working
without pay.
Federal employees are not the
swamp, as some would have you be-
lieve. Federal employees are the people
who make sure that Social Security
checks are mailed on time each month.
They are the scientists researching
cures for cancer. They are tour guides
in our national parks. They are FBI
agents investigating criminal activity.
They are the air traffic controllers and
TSA agents keeping us safe when we
fly.
We saw during the shutdown how im-
portant every dollar of every paycheck
is for Federal employees to pay their
bills, to pay their rent, to pay their
mortgage, to afford childcare, to pay
off their student loans, and, yes, even
to feed their families.
It is time to give Federal employees
the pay raise and the respect they de-
serve, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation.
The Acting CHAIR. Members are re-
minded to refrain from engaging in
personalities toward the President.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Let me close by saying a sincere
word of compliment to the gentleman
from Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS) and the
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY).
We have great differences on this
piece of legislation, and, indeed, we
represent very different districts. It
has been said many times that you can
disagree without being disagreeable,
and I want to compliment the two gen-
tlemen for their vigorous debate today
yet where they didn’t make personal
attacks. I hope that, Mr. Chairman,
they have seen the same from me, and
I have high respect for both of them.
I also believe that, at times, where
perhaps we deescalate the emotions—
and I know this is a highly charged,
emotional debate, as it should be—we
can find common ground.
Mr. Chairman, I commit to the two
gentlemen with whom I have had the
privilege of working for the last 6 years
that I will continue to work hard and
with great resolve to find ways that we
can not only recognize and compensate
our Federal workers, but we can do so
in a manner that is fair and equitable
and certainly makes sure that the serv-
ants they are is recognized.
Mr. Chairman, I would also say that
this particular piece of legislation,
hopefully, will provide the fodder for us
going back to the committee and going
through a markup process to look at
how we actually address this, where we
actually have hearings and bring in ex-
perts, because, Mr. Chairman, we have
had the majority leader of the Congress
on this House floor citing one par-
ticular survey and we have had me here
citing the CBO, and those two statis-
tics are at odds. So I think it is impor-
tant that we hear from real experts and
figure out how we do this.
The time is now for us to find a way
to work in a bipartisan manner to
truly move this country forward. The
Federal workforce is an important part
of that.
I believe this particular piece of leg-
islation sends a bad message to those
Federal workers who believe that pay
raises are not based on merit, that
they don’t identify the poor per-
formers. We have to address that as
well, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman, I urge rejection of this
bill, and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chair, may I in-
quire how much time I have remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland has 5 minutes remain-
ing.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, I insert in the RECORD an
article from The Washington Post that
reports the Federal Salary Council, the
official monitor of Federal pay, found
that Federal workers make an average
of 30 percent less than their private-
sector counterparts.
[From the Washington Post, Nov. 14, 2018]
FEDERAL EMPLOYEE SALARIES LAG BY
AVERAGE OF 31 PERCENT, PAY GROUP REPORTS
(By Eric Yoder)
Federal employee salaries on average lag
behind those of the private sector by almost
31 percent, an advisory council said Tuesday,
while splitting between union and non-union
members on whether to recommend poten-
tial changes in the way it arrives at that fig-
ure.
The average salary difference of 30.91 per-
cent reported by the Federal Salary Council
is somewhat smaller than the 31.86 percent it
reported at a special meeting it held April.
The figures of prior years were in the 34 to 35
percent range.
Those figures, based on two Labor Depart-
ment surveys covering some 250 occupations,
stand in contrast to assessments of some
conservative and libertarian organizations
that have concluded that the advantage is
about the same or even greater in favor of
federal employees.
The Congressional Budget Office last year
essentially split the difference. It found an
average advantage for federal workers of 3
percent, although within that average it said
there is a wide range by educational level:
from a 34 percent advantage for federal
workers with a high school education or less
to a 24 percent shortfall for those with a pro-
fessional degree or doctorate.
Under a federal pay law, the ‘‘pay gap’’ as
measured by the Salary Council is to be used
in setting annual raises varying by locality
for federal employees under the General
Schedule, the pay system covering most
white-collar employees below the executive
levels. However, that law never has been fol-
lowed due to the potential cost of paying
such large raises and disagreements over
how the figure is calculated.
In an August message to Congress, Presi-
dent Trump said that following the law’s for-
mula would result in locality-based raises in
January 2019 averaging 25.7 percent plus an
across-the-board raise of 2.1 percent, at a
cost of $25 billion. ‘‘Federal agency budgets
cannot sustain such increases,’’ Trump’s said
in backing a pay freeze that he originally
proposed in a budget plan early this year.
A House-Senate conference underway on a
spending bill will decide between a freeze and
a Senate provision to pay an average 1.9 per-
cent raise. Unless Congress passes, and
Trump signs, a bill specifying a raise, sala-
ries will be frozen by default. If the raise is
enacted, it would vary slightly among 44 city
areas and what is called the ‘‘rest of the
U.S.’’ locality everywhere else; employees
working in the Washington-Baltimore area
would stand to receive one of the larger
raises, probably around 2.3 percent.
The long-running controversy over com-
paring salaries flared at Tuesday’s meeting
of the Salary Council, a group of federal em-
ployee unions and compensation experts
whose decisions typically are unanimous.
A ‘‘working group’’ document produced
since the April meeting laid out a series of
potential changes for consideration by a
higher-level body called the President’s Pay
Agent. Those options included adding more
detailed data on salaries by occupation and
level of work, taking into account other data
such as attrition rates, switching to a ‘‘total
compensation’’ approach taking benefits
into account, and conducting a very detailed
review only once every four or five years—
the latter two of which would require a
change in law.
Council chairman Ron Sanders, a longtime
career federal personnel official who is now a
clinical professor at the University of South
Florida School of Public Affairs, argued in
favor of exploring those options. ‘‘I think it’s
obvious to all of us that the current method-
ology is problematic,’’ he said.
‘‘That methodology does not tell the whole
story,’’ Sanders said. ‘‘It’s nice to say there’s
a 30 percent gap. If OMB [the Office of Man-
agement and Budget] doesn’t believe it, the
White House doesn’t believe it, the Congress
doesn’t believe it, what good does it do?’’
He pointed to the testimony of officials of
federal agencies from several urban and
rural areas not now receiving higher city-
based locality pay, who told of their difficul-
ties in recruiting and retaining employees
despite using special hiring authorities and
incentive payments. However, the current
process doesn’t support specific salary rates
for them, he said.
Two other members supported exploring
the options: Katja Bullock, associate direc-
tor of presidential personnel, and Jill Nelson,
who leads an advisory committee on pay for
blue-collar federal employees.
However, members from federal unions ar-
gued against changing the calculations and
questioned whether the group even has the
authority to raise new options for consider-
ation. ‘‘I don’t think the methodology is bro-
ken,’’ said J. David Cox Sr., president of the
American Federation of Government Em-
ployees.
‘‘The elephant in the room is the Congress
and the president over time not funding the

pay system’’ as the law intended, said Randy
L. Erwin, president of the National Federa-
tion of Federal Employees. Anthony M.
Reardon, president of the National Treasury
Employees Union, expressed concern that in-
cluding the value of federal benefits ‘‘will be
used as a justification to reduce those bene-
fits.’’
The council adjourned without voting on
whether to recommend that the Pay Agent
consider different approaches. Afterward,
Sanders said that in the annual report to
that higher-level body to be made by year’s
end, individual members of the Salary Coun-
cil could express their own opinions.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chair, it is so
important that we do everything in our
power to support our Federal employ-
ees, and I want to thank Mr. CONNOLLY
and Mr. HOYER. They have given their
blood and their sweat and their tears
for Federal employees: constantly
standing up for them, trying to make
sure that they are treated fairly and
given their due.
Just today, I spoke to two people who
were telling me about how Federal em-
ployees at NIH basically saved their
lives—saved their lives. One told me
that the person who saved their life
was making about $65,000. This is a doc-
tor. Come on now. And the other said it
was about, maybe, $70,000 at best.
These are people who could have been
doing other things, could have been
making a lot of money, but they de-
cided to give their efforts to a greater
cause.
Their names will probably never ap-
pear on the front page—or any page—of
The Washington Post. They won’t be
on ABC News. They will not have the
mansion that they could have gotten,
but they have done something that will
have fed their souls. They have come to
the job with passion, compassion, and
the desire to make things better, and
they are the ones who have determined
that they want to put their finger-
prints on the future of generations yet
unborn.
Then there are the others, like the
TSA workers—you know the ones—
earning $28,000 a year and coming to
work, by the way, during the shutdown
when they couldn’t even afford the gas
to get there. What about them?
So we can make example after exam-
ple after example, but one thing is for
sure, and that is that they are working
hard and they deserve our utmost sup-
port.
Now, if any message is going to be
sent today, I pray, Mr. Chair, that that
message goes to our Federal employees
that we care about them and that they
are not unseen, unnoticed,
unappreciated, and unapplauded. No.
I hope the message goes out that we
are upholding them and we realize that
it is just not about them. We realize,
when they don’t get their raise, their
family doesn’t get their raise. When
they don’t get their raise, maybe that
little girl they wanted to send to ballet
lessons can’t get them. We get that.
Or maybe that little vacation that
they wanted to take, they can’t get
that. They are not trying to get to Dis-
ney World. They are just trying to get
to the nearest amusement park with
some tuna fish and crackers.

Come on now. And that is what this
is all about. We can talk about fences
all we want.
Right now, we are talking about the
building of people and making their
lives the best that they can be. We only
have one life to live. This is no dress
rehearsal, and this is that life.
I applaud the gentleman from North
Carolina. I know his heart is right, but
right now, I want to concentrate on
those folks, the ones like people who
live on my block, who get up at 5 in the
morning, catch the early bus to get to
Social Security and places, and trying
to serve the public. I am talking about
them.
Mr. Chair, I pray and I ask the Mem-
bers to vote in favor of this great legis-
lation.
I thank Mr. CONNOLLY, Mr. HOYER,
Ms. WEXTON, and all of our cosponsors,
and I thank the gentleman from North
Carolina (Mr. MEADOWS).
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Chair, I rise today in
support of H.R. 790, the Federal Civilian
Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act of 2019.
Our federal civilian workforce, who contin-
ued to work without pay through a record-long
35-day shutdown, deserves to be fairly com-
pensated for their dedication to our country.
Often unnoticed, this group includes TSA
agents who ensure our airports and air travel
is safe, the FBI, which actively combats ter-
rorism, and CBP agents, who diligently protect
our borders. These heroic employees deserve
to see their salary reflect the important and
selfless work they do on behalf of the United
States.
The civilian federal workforce also includes
FDA personnel who ensure the food we eat is
safe, National Park rangers who patrol and
maintain our beautiful national parks, and IRS
employees who work tirelessly to process and
distribute tax refunds to Americans all over
this country.
Mr. Chair, these federal workers dedicate
their lives to serving the American people and
this great nation—it is about time we return
the favor by ensuring they are fairly com-
pensated for their hard work.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise today
in support of H.R. 790, the Federal Civilian
Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act of 2019.
On December 28, 2018, one week into the
longest government shutdown in history,
President Trump added insult to injury by an-
nouncing that all federal civilian workers would
not receive a pay raise in 2019.
This action continues the years of menial
pay raises that federal employees have re-
ceived.
Federal employees have endured pay
freezes, hiring freezes, higher pension con-
tributions, and furloughs as a result of seques-
tration and government shutdowns, including
the longest shutdown in our nation’s history.
Texas has over 270,000 federal employees.
Almost 4,000 of those federal employees
call my district, Texas 18, home.
It is time that Congress act and shows its
appreciation for these and the almost 2 million
other men and women who are federal em-
ployees and the services they provide to our
great nation.
Denying these federal workers a hard-
earned raise is not the way to balance the
budget.
Providing these workers with a raise is not
an unrealistic burden on the federal budget.
The cost of a pay raise would be approxi-
mately $25 billion.
Trump’s tax reform bill cost over 10 times
this amount.
It is inappropriate for the President to use
these civil servants as a bargaining chip, and
it is inappropriate to not recognize their hard
work and dedication through a much earned
pay raise.
For too long, federal employees have been
the victims of attacks being told that ‘‘good
people don’t go into government,’’ that the fed-
eral government is full of ‘‘waste, fraud, and
abuse.’’
This is categorically false.
Federal employees have contributed nearly
$200 billion to deficit reduction and other gov-
ernment programs over the past several
years.
These attacks on federal employees are in
addition to the Republican attacks on federal
worker pay and benefits that have been hap-
pening for years.
We need to help the morale of the federal
workforce.
We need to make the federal government
competitive with the private sector so that
highly qualified candidates are able to serve
the American people.
We need to retain the talent that we have.
It is time for Congress to show their support
for the men and women who work selflessly
and tirelessly for our government with this
modest pay raise.
H.R. 790 would authorize a 2.6 percent pay
raise for federal civilian workers and estab-
lished pay parity between them and military
service members for 2019, a longstanding
Congressional tradition.
Federal workers who would receive this pay
raise are employees in the competitive and
excepted services; prevailing wage or blue
collar workers; members of the career Senior
Executive Service; and employees in the sci-
entific and senior level positions.
This modest pay increase, between
$488.41–$4,041.54 a year, would help offset
the cost of inflation and to make up for years
of freezes and negligible increases.
I am a strong supporter of the men and
women who make up the federal civilian work-
force, and I ask my colleagues to show their
support to these integral federal employees by
joining me in supporting H.R. 790.
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I rise today in sup-
port of the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay
Raise Fairness Act.
Our federal public servants dedicate their
lives to serving their fellow Americans.
Today, let’s thank them for their dedicated
service to our country by providing them and
their families an overdue pay raise that they
have earned.
The Trump shutdown exposed the all-too-
real economic reality for many Americans. Mil-
lions live paycheck-to-paycheck, including
many of our public servants. They did not
choose a life of public service to make it rich,
but rather to serve and improve the lives of
their fellow citizens.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1304 January 30, 2019
The shutdown also crystalized the daily im-
pact federal workers have on all our lives. 85
percent of all federal workers live outside of
Washington, and their paychecks drive the
economies of communities across the U.S.
This increase of 2.6 percent will help federal
workers, 1 in 8 of whom make less than
$40,000 a year, make ends meet while stimu-
lating local small businesses across the nation
when federal employees spend their earnings.
Mr. Chair, it is unacceptable that their pay
has not reflected the increased demands of
cost of living for years. It’s time we give our
hardworking federal employees the pay raise
they deserve and earn every day.
The Acting CHAIR. All time for gen-
eral debate has expired.
Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be

AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR. TRONE
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 1 printed in
part B of House Report 116–5.
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Chairman, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Insert after section 2(e) the following (and
redesignate subsequent subsections accord-
ingly):
(f) SECRET SERVICE EMPLOYEES.—For cal-
endar year 2019, the rate of basic pay of any
employee of the United States Secret Serv-
ice provided under chapter 102 of title 5,
United States Code, who did not receive a
pay increase by operation of subsections (a)
through (e) shall be increased by 2.6 percent.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 87, the gentleman
from Maryland (Mr. TRONE) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Maryland.
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Chairman, I rise to
speak on behalf of this amendment,
which would guarantee the United
States Secret Service receive a 2.6 per-
cent pay increase with the rest of the
civilian workforce.
The underlying bill will nullify the
President’s executive order that froze
pay for Federal workers. It is impor-
tant we include all employees of the
Secret Service in that correction.
The Secret Service’s most well-
known mission is to spend every day
protecting the President of the United
States. That is why it is unfortunate.
First, he froze their pay, and then he
didn’t pay them for 35 days in the long-
est government shutdown in history.
I represent a district right outside of
Washington, D.C., and a lot of my
friends and fellow constituents are
Federal workers. I was disheartened to
learn in December they would not be
receiving a pay increase. They go to
work every day to serve our country.
They are American workers; they are
patriots; they are friends; and they de-
serve better.
This amendment will ensure that no
Secret Service employees are inadvert-
ently left out of a much-needed pay
raise. They work every day to protect
the President and the Vice President
from harm and protect against crimes
of our Nation’s financial and banking
infrastructure, and they deserve rec-
ognition, and they deserve a raise.
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this amend-
ment.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, I
claim the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from North Carolina is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself as much time as I may
consume.
Mr. Chairman, this amendment suf-
fers some of the same defects as the un-
derlying bill.
Mr. Chairman, while there are nu-
merous dedicated civil servants in all
parts of the Federal Government, offer-
ing an additional across-the-board pay
raise is simply not good policy. It re-
wards the bad along with the good.
The United States Secret Service is
made up of many brave men and
women, very honorable men and
women. However, in 2015, the bipar-
tisan report issued jointly by then-
Chairman Chaffetz and the new chair-
man of Oversight and Reform, then-
Ranking Member CUMMINGS of the
Oversight and Government Reform
Committee, detailed significant per-
sonnel problems. The report describes
‘‘an extraordinarily inefficient hiring
process which overburdens the USSS
with low-quality applications.’’
So the men and women of the uni-
formed division render critical services
to our government. Many of them are
friends. And, truly, as we see their
dedication, they have to sacrifice so
much. Whether it is at the Vice Presi-
dent’s residence or whether it is on the
complex just a few blocks from here,
there is no margin for failure with re-
spect to their protective mission, and I
acknowledge that.
However, an across-the-board pay in-
crease does exactly that. It rewards the
good along with the bad. That is why
we have to have, indeed, a merit-based
system that truly recognizes the great
performers—the vast majority of whom
are great performance—but does not
recognize and reward those who are not
doing it. We need to do that. And for
that reason, I would reject this par-
ticular amendment and ask my col-
leagues to oppose it.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Chairman, I would
like to point out that this is just a
clarifying amendment.
The Secret Service has pay authority
for certain positions. We want to be
sure that none of those positions are
inadvertently left out of this under-
lying bill. In short, the amendment
guarantees all Secret Service employ-
ees are treated the same—fair and sim-
ple.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1305
January 30, 2019
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, to re-
hash all the reasons, both good and
bad, I am willing to work in a bipar-
tisan way with the chairman of both
the committee and the subcommittee
to try to find ways to address this
issue. This amendment does not do
that.
Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Virginia
(Mr. CONNOLLY).
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I
thank my good friend from Maryland
for his leadership on this amendment,
which I support.
The Secret Service do put themselves
on the line, and the studies my friend
from North Carolina cited had to do
with bad management and bad working
conditions that really affect morale
and productivity at the Secret Service.
The gentleman’s amendment is de-
signed to try to help that situation.
The idea that an across-the-board
cost of living increase doesn’t distin-
guish between productivity and non-
productivity, performance or non-
performance, would also apply to the
military.
My friend has no objection to an
across-the-board increase for the mili-
tary, but apparently on the civilian
side, that is different. We are making
the opposite argument. We are making
the argument that pay parity is the
right thing to do, especially after this
reckless shutdown.
Mr. Chairman, I congratulate my
friend from Maryland on his amend-
ment, and I support it.
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the Rules Committee for making this
amendment in order. I urge adoption of
this amendment, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. TRONE).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MRS. FLETCHER
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 2 printed in
part B of House Report 116–5.
Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Chairman, I
have an amendment at the desk and
ask for its consideration.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as
follows:
Insert after section 2(e) the following (and
redesignate subsequent subsections accord-
ingly):
(f) NASA EMPLOYEES.—For calendar year
2019, the rate of basic pay of any employee of
the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration provided under chapter 98 of title 5,
United States Code, who did not receive a
pay increase by operation of subsections (a)
through (e) shall be increased by 2.6 percent.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 87, the gentlewoman
from Texas (Mrs. FLETCHER) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas.
Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an
amendment to ensure that the pay
raises are equally distributed to all
Federal employees at the National Aer-
onautics and Space Administration.
In the Houston area that I represent,
there are more than 3,000 Federal civil
servants who do important work at the
Johnson Space Center. While most of
these employees work under the tradi-
tional GS pay scale and would be cov-
ered by the base pay scale adjustment,
there are certain employees who would
not.
NASA, like many technical agencies,
can authorize certain pay flexibilities
under different chapters of the code to
recruit talented individuals. My
amendment merely clarifies that these
employees are equally deserving of this
pay raise.
After the shutdown, it is now more
important than ever to work to retain
talented civil service employees around
our country, especially at NASA.
I would like to thank my colleagues
for working with me on this amend-
ment and urge their support to ensure
that the hardworking civil servants get
the pay raise that they deserve.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, I
claim time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from North Carolina is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, I am
going to keep my remarks brief as we
have got a number of different amend-
ments going through.
I acknowledge the gentlewoman’s te-
nacity and her willingness to offer this.
I would point out, Mr. Chairman,
though, this particular across-the-
board pay raise, it really shouldn’t
apply to the very individuals that she
is talking about because they have
flexibility already. We know that. I
mean, they get different pay raises.
That is not to undermine the wonder-
ful work that they do. I have been priv-
ileged to be able to talk to NASA folks
from here in Washington, DC, to her
home district in the great State of
Texas and across this country. Re-
markably, they are one of the best run
agencies—and I say that under the pre-
vious NASA Administrator and under
the current NASA Administrator.
So it is not to not acknowledge their
good work, but the whole premise of
being able to give them a bump, there
is already great pushback among some
Federal workers about the flexibility
of those individuals and the way that
they get their pay raises. There are
claims of unfairness. So I think that
this sends a wrong message.
Mr. Chair, I urge the rejection of this
particular amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Chairman, I
just want to reiterate that the purpose
of this amendment isn’t to address the
underlying issues that the gentleman
from North Carolina raised, but it is
really to just ensure that the language
of this amendment may be applied
equally and that no one at NASA is left
behind because of differences in the
way that their compensation structure
is currently scheduled. This is a clari-
fying amendment, and it is just dedi-
cated to the purpose of making sure
that these employees may be included
and not excluded from this act.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Mrs. FLETCHER).
The amendment was agreed to.

Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I want to commend the sponsors of
this important bill that rewards the
talent and commitment of our civilian
workforce by granting them a 2.6 per-
cent pay adjustment for 2019.
Mr. Chairman, the shutdown was a
stark reminder of how crucial these
workers are to protect our air and
water, secure our shores, guide air traf-
fic, and ensure that our tax returns are
processed on time.
I heard desperate stories from many
of these public servants, including
workers at the IRS processing center
in Andover. One of my constituents
who works there wrote the following to
me during the shutdown: ‘‘Apart from
selling everything I own to pay for
food, bills, and the mortgage, I hon-
estly don’t know what to do and am
truly scared that this may do me in.’’
Mr. Chairman, this was an entirely
avoidable tragedy that wreaked havoc
on thousands of lives; yet he and thou-
sands of others like him dutifully re-
ported to work without any certainty
of when or whether they would be paid
next. The underlying bill is the least
we can do for them and the dedicated

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1306 January 30, 2019
public servants like them. My amend-
ment is a simple clarification that all
IRS employees would be eligible for
this pay adjustment.
We learned yesterday from legisla-
tive counsel that the bill could inad-
vertently exclude some of these em-
ployees hired under special provisions
of chapter 95, title 5.
For example, title 5, section 9503
grants IRS special authority to hire
employees for critical administrative,
technical, and professional positions
necessary to carry out the functions of
the IRS. However, it is unclear whether
such individuals would benefit from
H.R. 790’s pay adjustment. This amend-
ment simply removes any doubt.
I hope that the amendment can be
adopted.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, I rise
in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from North Carolina is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, I
would highlight one thing.
We are going through all these
amendments that are clarifying and
technical amendments and all of that.
That could have all been avoided if we
had just had a hearing and had a mark-
up and we had gone through it, and yet
here we are today on the House floor
trying to make amendments to a bill
that, candidly, is missing the mark.
Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
Ohio (Mr. JORDAN).
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Chairman, this is
one of the most ridiculous amendments
I have ever seen.
Just a few years ago, the IRS tar-
geted people for their political beliefs,
systematically, for a sustained period
of time, went after conservatives be-
cause they didn’t like their political
beliefs and what they were doing.
Now we are saying to those same peo-
ple across this country—we had con-
stituents. Congressman MEADOWS had
constituents. The gentlewoman from
Massachusetts may have constituents.
We are now saying to them: Mr. and
Mrs. Taxpayer, you may have been tar-
geted by the IRS, but now we are going
to take some of your hard-earned tax
money and pay them, give them a pay
raise?
Giving people a pay raise who went
after people’s most fundamental right,
your right to speak out against—your
First Amendment liberties, that is
what this amendment would do.
Also, the chairman knows this. We
did an investigation in the Oversight
Committee. The IRS had fired people
who they then rehired—now think
about this—and some of the people
they rehired, who had been fired, some
of the very people they rehired were
people who didn’t pay their taxes, and
we are now going to give them a pay
raise. You have got to be kidding me.
The very agency that systematically
went after people, went after our most
fundamental right, our right, under the
First Amendment, to speak out against
our government, went after people for
doing that because they didn’t like
their political beliefs, set up this elabo-
rate system, this ‘‘Be on the Lookout’’
list, Lois Lerner, and the whole 9
yards, did that, also the same agency
that fired people for not paying their
taxes and then rehired them, and now
the taxpayers have to give them a pay
raise. That is what the Democrats want
in this amendment.
This is ridiculous. We should reject
this, and we should reject, as we talked
about before, the whole darn bill.
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CONNOLLY).
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I
thank my friend from Massachusetts,
and I congratulate her on this amend-
ment.
I can’t believe that the distinguished
ranking member of our committee
would continue to engage in conspiracy
theories that have been, in fact, dis-
proved and, worse, would actually
paint the entire 41,000 or more work-
force of the IRS with one brush. They
are all, apparently, out to get us.
You would never know these are
hardworking public servants who serve
their country nobly and often under
very difficult circumstances, because
they are hardly the most popular agen-
cy in town.
Of course they deserve a pay raise.
They were affected by the shutdown.
Many of them were called back by the
Trump administration to come back
without pay because certain industries
needed paper being processed. They did
it because they are noble public serv-
ants and they are patriots, as the dis-
tinguished chairman of our committee
indicated.
So instead of slandering public serv-
ants, we want to honor them.
You are right. We are proud of this
amendment, and it is anything but the
most ridiculous to come to the floor. It
is a very important amendment. I sup-
port it.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, I
yield such time as he may consume to
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN).
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Chairman, I am
not painting with a broad brush. Look,
I know there are lots of good employ-
ees there. All I am saying is an agency
that did what the IRS did, that rehired
people who had been fired, some of
them had been fired for not paying
their taxes, an agency that went after
people for their political beliefs, I
just—call me crazy, but you can go ask
your average taxpayer: Do you think
that agency that did those things, do
you think those people need a pay
raise?
My guess is most of the constituents
I get the privilege of representing in
the Fourth District of Ohio would say:
Nope, I am not for that.
That is all I am saying, not painting
with a broad brush.
All I know is what this agency did.
And it is not a conspiracy theory, and
the gentleman from Virginia knows it.
The inspector general did a report
and said targeting occurred at the In-
ternal Revenue Service. They went
after conservative Tea Party conserv-
ative groups, and it happened just as
sure I am standing here speaking on
the House floor, and the gentleman
from Virginia knows that to be the
case.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, I can
tell you that when we look at sending
a message, this sends entirely the
wrong message. We need to make sure
that we reward Federal workers, but
we also hold them accountable. I urge
rejection of this particular amend-
ment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Chairman, the
employees I talked to at the IRS are
noble. They are hardworking. They are
working with the utmost integrity.
They have endured cuts to their agen-
cy, at times doing jobs that used to re-
quire two, sometimes three people to
do.
Again, my amendment merely makes
a clarifying change to be certain that
all of these employees, all IRS workers,
receive the benefit of this well-de-
served pay adjustment. I urge my col-
leagues to adopt the amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Massachusetts (Mrs.
TRAHAN).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chairman, I de-
mand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentlewoman from Massachusetts
will be postponed.
Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Chairman, I
move that the Committee do now rise.
The motion was agreed to.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Mrs.
FLETCHER) having assumed the chair,
Mr. CÁRDENAS, Acting Chair of the
Committee of the Whole House on the
state of the Union, reported that that
Committee, having had under consider-
ation the bill (H.R. 790) to provide for a
pay increase in 2019 for certain civilian
employees of the Federal Government,
and for other purposes, had come to no
resolution thereon.

January 30, 2019
EXPRESSING SENSE OF HOUSE
THAT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS
ARE DETRIMENTAL TO NATION
AND SHOULD NOT OCCUR
Mr. CLAY. Madam Speaker, I move
to suspend the rules and agree to the
resolution (H. Res. 79) expressing the
sense of the House of Representatives
that Government shutdowns are detri-
mental to the Nation and should not
occur, as amended.
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion.
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 79
Whereas a portion of the United States
Government was shut down from December
22, 2018, to January 25, 2019;
Whereas the Senate, on December 19, 2018,
unanimously passed legislation to fund Gov-
ernment operations and avert a Government
shutdown but that legislation was not en-
acted;
Whereas the Government shutdown lasted
for 35 days, the longest Government shut-
down in the history of our country;
Whereas the lapse in appropriations de-
prived Americans of important services and
caused 800,000 Federal workers to go without
pay for more than a month, imposing signifi-
cant financial hardships on those workers
and their families;
Whereas the lapse in appropriations det-
rimentally affected the Federal Govern-
ment’s ability to recruit and retain career
public servants;
Whereas the lapse in appropriations put at
risk thousands of small businesses with Fed-
eral contracts and created severe financial
hardship for tens of thousands of employees
of Federal contractors;
Whereas the top economic advisor to the
President of the United States predicted that
the Government shutdown would reduce eco-
nomic growth by 0.1 percent for each week it
lasted;
Whereas the Congressional Budget Office
has estimated the direct effect of the shut-
down to have cost our economy $11,000,000,000
in lost gross domestic product;
Whereas the lapse in appropriations forced
Transportation Security Administration
screeners and air traffic controllers to work
without pay, causing many to be unable to
afford to work and thereby putting at risk
the safety and well-being of the traveling
public, leading to flight delays, and harming
airport security operations;
Whereas the lapse in appropriations put
the health of all Americans at risk by cur-
tailing and delaying food safety inspections;
Whereas the lapse in appropriations made
our Nation less safe by impeding Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation efforts to crack down
on child trafficking, violent crime, and ter-
rorism;
Whereas the lapse in appropriations re-
sulted in the shuttering of and, in some
cases, damage to, countless national parks,
monuments and other public lands;
Whereas the lapse in appropriations fur-
loughed numerous Federal employees at the
Federal Emergency Management Agency and
the Department of Housing and Urban Devel-
opment (HUD), limiting the Federal Govern-
ment’s ability to help communities rebuild
after natural disasters;
Whereas the lapse in appropriations re-
sulted in a majority of Environmental Pro-
tection Agency employees being furloughed,
with negative consequences for public health
and the environment, such as halted clean-
up work at hundreds of toxic Superfund sites
across the country, a cessation in inspection
and enforcement activities, and a stop to
new chemical and pesticide safety evalua-
tions and approvals;
Whereas the lapse in appropriations de-
layed payment of Department of Agriculture
loans, operating loan decisions, planting and
marketing decisions and much-needed assist-
ance for farmers harmed by retaliatory tar-
iffs imposed on American agricultural ex-
ports, prevented the implementation of a
new farm bill with critical support for strug-
gling dairy farmers and other operations,
and cast damaging uncertainty on the nutri-
tion assistance relied on by millions of vul-
nerable Americans;
Whereas the lapse in appropriations de-
layed the issuance of tax refunds to Amer-
ica’s hard-working taxpayers;
Whereas the lapse in appropriations penal-
ized small business owners by halting the ap-
proval of Small Business Administration
loans;
Whereas the lapse in appropriations im-
peded the operations of United States embas-
sies abroad, undermining the ability of
United States personnel to combat terror,
enforce sanctions, and strengthen alliances;
Whereas the lapse in appropriations under-
mined the ability of the Department of
Homeland Security to respond to increased
cybersecurity threats, natural disasters, and
terror threats;
Whereas the lapse in appropriations de-
layed approval of FHA-backed mortgages,
putting Americans at risk of losing the
house they were attempting to buy or sell;
Whereas the lapse in appropriations hob-
bled the ability of the Department of Hous-
ing and Urban Development to administer
the Section 8 low-income housing program
that allows for HUD to provide affordable
rental housing to low-income tenants, in-
cluding the elderly and disabled;
Whereas Senator Mitch McConnell has
called shutdowns ‘‘a failed policy’’;
Whereas Senator Susan Collins said on
January 23, 2019, ‘‘shutdowns represent the
ultimate failure to govern and should never
be used as a weapon to achieve an outcome’’;
and
Whereas Senator Lamar Alexander said on
January 24, 2019, ‘‘it is always wrong for ei-
ther side to use shutting down the Govern-
ment as a bargaining chip in budget negotia-
tions—it should be as off-limits as chemical
weapons are to warfare’’: Now, therefore, be
it
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House
of Representatives that—
(1) the shutdown of the Government of the
United States, or any portion thereof, causes
substantial damage to Federal employees, to
every American who benefits directly or in-
directly from Federal services, to our Na-
tion’s economy, and to the reputation of the
United States around the world;
(2) shutting down the Government of the
United States, or any portion thereof, is not
an acceptable tactic or strategy for resolving
differences regarding policy, funding levels,
or governing philosophy; and
(3) in the future the Congress must ensure
the continued, uninterrupted operations of
the Government of the United States and its
services as well as its duty to protect and
promote the security of the American peo-
ple.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
Missouri (Mr. CLAY) and the gentleman
from North Carolina (Mr. MEADOWS)
each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Missouri.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. CLAY. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res.
79.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Missouri?
There was no objection.
Mr. CLAY. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I am relieved and
grateful that the longest government
shutdown in our Nation’s history has
ended. I am sure that many people
share these same feelings, including
my colleagues. The American people,
and especially, the 800,000 Federal em-
ployees who were furloughed or forced
to work without pay for 35 days, have
to be relieved.
I hope that the one positive thing to
come out of this experience is uni-
versal recognition that government
shutdowns are almost always pointless
exercises that are harmful to our coun-
try and our constituents.
The Federal Government should be
open for business and not closed. That
is why I strongly support H. Res. 79,
the measure before us today.
Even though the recent shutdown af-
fected only part of the Federal Govern-
ment, its impact was deeply felt
throughout the country. The Depart-
ments of Homeland Security, State,
Treasury, Commerce, Justice, Agri-
culture, the EPA, and NASA, were
shuttered.
Operations at these agencies essen-
tially came to a screeching halt:
Phone calls went unanswered as Fed-
eral workers were furloughed;
Safety inspections of industrial sites,
factories, and power plants, were halt-
ed because EPA inspectors were sent
home;
Food inspections at the FDA ceased;
Scientists at the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration and
the Fish and Wildlife Service were fur-
loughed.
Law enforcement officers at the FBI,
DEA, Secret Service, and Customs and
Border Protection were the lucky ones.
They got to work without pay. These
dedicated men and women, many of
whom make only $60,000 a year, missed
more than a month’s pay.
Just like other middle-class families,
Federal employees have bills to pay
also: food, mortgages, rent, medical
bills, student loans, and car payments.
And like so many other Americans,
many live paycheck to paycheck.
It is simply cruel to inflict such fi-
nancial hardship and unnecessary
stress on workers who just want to do
their jobs serving the American people.
The greatest irony of the last shut-
down is that immigration enforcement
and border protection suffered as a re-
sult, despite the President’s fixation on
a wall, a brilliant 14th century solution
to a 21st century problem.

tion courts, contributing to an already

significant backlog of cases and delays
in deportation.
The harm ripples through our econ-
omy, touching everyone from Federal
employees to Federal contractors, to
private sector businesses, and, most
importantly, to every American who
relies upon the vital services Federal
workers provide.
The CBO estimated that the eco-
nomic cost of the shutdown is $11 bil-
lion—that is $11 billion—almost twice
the cost of the funding the President
seeks for his wall.
We must learn from this recent shut-
down. We must not let it happen again
in a few short weeks. We can and must
do better and work together to prevent
any future shutdowns, which I am cer-
tain my friends and colleagues from
North Carolina and Ohio want to do. I
am sure they will have a short response
to opening statements and will prob-
ably join in with us.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself as much time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I notice a smirk on
your face. We find it laughable as well.
But I enjoy the gentleman from Mis-
souri.
Is that the way you say it, the gen-
tleman from Missouri?
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, Missouri,
like it is spelled.
Mr. MEADOWS. Missouri. Excuse me,
Mr. Speaker. Thank you.
Mr. Speaker, I enjoy the humor, but
unfortunately, there is nothing funny
about this.
I find it just unbelievable that the
gentleman opposite would be talking
about how important this resolution is.
They just dropped it on Monday night.
I mean, it hasn’t been out there for any
length of time. In fact, it violated the
very rule that this Chamber passed in
the beginning of this Congress, yet
somehow this resolution is so unbeliev-
ably important.
It is nothing more than a message
meant to go after the President of the
United States. Quite frankly, I find
this resolution nothing more than a po-
litical stunt. I am troubled by it, Mr.
Speaker, because here we are today ar-
guing over this resolution that could
have been dropped—we were here work-
ing. It could have been dropped long
ago, but the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia drops it just on Monday night of
this week.
Maybe they were working on the
wording in Puerto Rico when they were
down there caravanning with lobbyists,
Mr. Speaker, that you know very well.
Maybe when Christmas was here,
when the President was in the White
House willing to negotiate, they were
working and fine-tuning this message
to make sure that it is here.
No, that is not what this is about.
This is about a political stunt. This is
literally a political messaging point
meant to garner, hopefully, the support
for some Member of Congress who has
a swing district, so that they can send
a message and take it.
Mr. Speaker, I am here today to let
you know that we don’t need words. We
need compromise.
I take the gentleman from Missouri’s
word. If we are willing to work to-
gether and find a compromise, I think
we all would prefer that there is never
another shutdown.
In fact, I think that we ought to pro-
pose legislation that would suspend
congressional pay for every Member of
Congress if there is ever another shut-
down. Hopefully, my Members opposite
would join me in that, where we can
put some kind of pain to make sure
that we are there.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I might consume.
Mr. Speaker, I am sure my friends on
the other side will agree it does no one
good, it does this country no good,
when we shut down government.
I don’t know about you, but my
friend from North Carolina, I believe
he goes through airports sometimes. I
will say this: Over the last 5 weeks, it
was quite difficult for me to look in the
eyes of my constituents who happen to
be TSA agents and tell them: ‘‘I am
sorry, but you are going to miss a pay-
day,’’ or, ‘‘You are going to miss an-
other payday.’’
We are better than that. We are bet-
ter than that as a Congress, as an insti-
tution, and as a government.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms.
WEXTON), the sponsor of this legisla-
tion and my friend.
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.
CLAY) for yielding me time.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.
Res. 79, which is my resolution express-
ing the sense of the House of Rep-
resentatives that government shut-
downs are detrimental to the Nation
and should not occur.
Mr. Speaker, between December 22
and January 25, more than 800,000 Fed-
eral workers went without pay because
of the Trump shutdown.
Saying that shutdowns harm the
American people and the economy
should not be controversial. These
facts are not up for debate, or at least
they shouldn’t be. But yesterday, mem-
bers of the Freedom Caucus basically
tried to shut down the House of Rep-
resentatives because they objected to a
sentence in the resolution that said the
President shut down the government to
achieve a legislative end.
Now, he did. We all saw him say it on
television, and we have seen it many,
many times since then. But I am a
brand-new legislator, and I am all
about getting to ‘‘yes’’ and finding con-
sensus, so the offending clause has been
removed from this resolution and
should not be a problem anymore.
For 35 days, our workers were forced
to go without a paycheck. That is two
pay periods that workers had to make
difficult financial decisions for them-
selves and for their families.
Essential services were halted; na-
tional parks were shuttered; and our
national security was compromised
during this time.
TSA screeners and air traffic control-
lers were forced to work without pay.
FBI offices had to delay indictments
against violent criminals.
The CBO estimated the effect of the
Trump shutdown to be $11 billion, with
more than a quarter of that amount
permanently lost.
The shutdown also impacted our Fed-
eral Government’s ability to recruit
and retain career public servants, with
many Federal workers reconsidering
their career choices after this shut-
down irreparably harmed them.
On December 20, the President an-
nounced that he would refuse to sign
legislation that had been unanimously
passed by the Senate just the day be-
fore due to his insistence that Congress
provide funding to build a wall along
the southern border.
This was not a priority before Demo-
crats took over the House of Rep-
resentatives, but all of a sudden, it was
a crisis. This resulted in the longest
government shutdown in American his-
tory.
Mr. Speaker, my resolution high-
lights the substantial burdens that
were placed on the American people
from the President of the United
States attempting to use a government
shutdown to get a policy win. Nobody
wins when the government shuts down.
My district is home to tens of thou-
sands of Federal workers and govern-
ment contractors, and the impact of
the shutdown was felt in my district
almost immediately.
I also have heard from people all over
the country who were impacted by the
shutdown, including an air traffic con-
troller who told me about the stress
that going two pay periods without pay
added to what is already one of the
most stressful jobs in the Nation.
I heard from a family who had to give
up their Christmas entirely and who
asked their children to hold their
money, because they needed to make
sure they had the funds to buy food
during the prolonged shutdown.
I heard from the CEO of a small busi-
ness in my district that relies on Fed-
eral contracts with the Federal Gov-
ernment who was worried about how he
was going to continue to pay his work-
ers when his invoices from the Federal
Government were not being paid.
Meanwhile, the guidance from the ad-
ministration to workers without pay-
checks was to suggest they take out
loans, have a garage sale, babysit,
drive for Uber, become a mystery shop-
per, or ask their landlord for an exten-
sion on their rent.
On January 24, the Secretary of Com-
merce, Wilbur Ross, made comments
on live news expressing confusion
about why Federal employees who have
been furloughed or are working with-
out pay had to receive assistance at
food banks.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1309
January 30, 2019
These unreasonable suggestions from
the administration and the comments
from Secretary Ross showed just how
out of touch the administration is
when it comes to our Federal workers,
many of whom do live paycheck to pay-
check.
We have an opportunity to make it
clear that shutting down the Govern-
ment of the United States is not an ac-
ceptable strategy to resolve policy dif-
ferences.
Mr. Speaker, after all they have been
through, we owe assurances to the mil-
lions of Federal civilian workers, in-
cluding the hundreds of thousands who
were furloughed earlier this month,
that Congress will ensure continued,
uninterrupted operations of the Fed-
eral Government.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to
support this resolution.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. PERRY).
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, people at
home think they are watching C–
SPAN, but this is more like ‘‘Master-
piece Theatre.’’ I mean, this is actually
like a documentary where we record
what happened in history, but here we
see that we are going to change and re-
vise history. We are going to remind
everybody who is watching and every-
body in this House that, under this mi-
nority leader, who was the majority
leader at the time, we passed a bill in
this House to keep the government
open.
We didn’t want to shut down the gov-
ernment. We wanted to keep the gov-
ernment open and fund border security.
We passed it in this House.
Mr. Speaker, I know everybody is
smiling over there because you voted
against it, but we passed it in this
House, and we sent it to the Senate. It
was the Senate Democrats who said,
‘‘Oh, no. Oh, no, we are not going to do
any of that border security stuff. We
want you to go ahead and have the
shutdown, and then we will blame it all
on you.’’
Mr. Speaker, we are not here to re-
vise history. We would like to get to
the task at hand, which is solving this
issue of border security.
We ask the other side, instead of en-
gaging in this blame game, of which
they are wholly part of, obviously—
they didn’t want to keep the govern-
ment open. The Senate Democrats
didn’t want to do anything to keep the
government open. Forget this charade,
this theater, and let’s get to negoti-
ating on border security and making
sure that the American people are safe.
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the distinguished
majority leader.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, it is hard to respond to
that last speech.
A bill came from the Senate unani-
mously, Republicans and Democrats,
that would have opened the govern-
ment. We would have voted for that
bill, all of us, but after not moving on
Department of Homeland Security for
11–2/3 of a year, the then-majority
party added into that bill a piece of
legislation they knew would not pass
in the United States Senate. Demo-
crats would not be for it. The gen-
tleman is correct.
The gentleman knew they wouldn’t
be for it, and the gentleman knew they
couldn’t get 60 votes. Notwithstanding
that, they passed a piece of legislation
that directly resulted in the shutdown
of government.
I say that those are the facts.
As a matter of fact, we thought the
President of the United States agreed
with that bill, but somehow, in the
some 900 feet of there to here, he
changed his mind.
Maybe he talked to Ann Coulter or
Sean Hannity. I don’t know who the
operative adviser was, but he changed
his mind.
As a result, we had the longest shut-
down in history.
The CBO says it cost at least $11 bil-
lion. The economic adviser at the
White House said that it was costing at
least one-tenth of a point a week.
This resolution says: Shutdown is
stupid.
I am sure some don’t agree with that,
because I have been in this Chamber
when you have voted to keep the gov-
ernment shut down. And you don’t like
me saying that.
b 1230
Your Speaker asked you to open up
the government and 144 of you—your
Speaker, Mr. BOEHNER, not a Demo-
crat, said: Look, this is stupid. We need
to open up the government—voted no.
Now, it passed because all of us voted
with 87 Republicans, including your
present leader, who voted yes to open
up the government.
This resolution is so simple. A shut-
down is stupid. That is all it says. We
will see how you vote. And I am going
to say something about some people
who think it is stupid.
I want to thank my friend from Vir-
ginia, Ms. WEXTON, for her leadership
on this issue. She represents a district,
as I do, where there are many hard-
working Federal employees, who were
negatively affected.
We had an argument here about
whether we ought to give people a 2.6
percent raise, a COLA adjustment, to
keep them even with the economy. And
we voted to give them nothing—zero,
zip. Not a cost-of-living adjustment. No
pay at all.
I see my friend, the minority leader,
on the floor. He said, not paying 800,000
people was unacceptable. I agree with
him. I think it is unacceptable. I think
asking people to work and then not
paying them is not a moral thing to do.
This resolution, as I said, is simple.
It is one I believe nearly every Member
of this House ought to support, unless
you support shutting down the govern-
ment of the United States of America.
It says, a shutdown should never be a
strategy in negotiations over funding,
period, full stop.
We just endured 35 days of a dan-
gerous and unnecessary partial govern-
ment shutdown that cost 800,000 Amer-
ican workers to be denied their pay-
checks and that the CBO says, as I just
said, $11 billion was the cost. Those are
the direct costs.
Our resolution makes it clear that
such a use of shutdowns, or the threat
of shutdowns, ought not to be tolerated
in our political system. Now, this reso-
lution says that, but I am going to
have some other people who are going
to say that as well.
No other country has this phe-
nomena. I can’t find another country
that shuts its government down. In
Australia, if you shut the government
down, the government falls, so you
have to form a new government.
There is no reason why Americans
should have to live under the threat of
being taken hostage, yet again, the
next time there is an unresolved debate
over an issue, whatever the issue might
be.
Even many Republican leaders agree
that using a shutdown is wrong. I think
most leaders, as a matter of fact, not
everyone.
Senate Republican Leader MITCH
MCCONNELL very definitively called
shutdowns ‘‘a failed policy.’’
And Senator SUSAN COLLINS, right-
fully, said, just a few days ago that:
‘‘Shutdowns represent the ultimate
failure to govern and should never be
used as a weapon’’—let me repeat
that—‘‘and should never be used as a
weapon to achieve an outcome.’’
Now, Mr. Speaker, I am sure my col-
leagues all know LAMAR ALEXANDER,
the former Governor of Tennessee,
former Secretary of Education, a Mem-
ber of the United States Senate, and
someone who was prominently men-
tioned and regularly mentioned as a
candidate for President of the United
States on the Republican ticket. Here
is what he said: ‘‘It is always wrong for
either side to use shutting down the
government as a bargaining chip in
budget negotiations.’’
Now, Mr. Speaker, I want my col-
leagues to hear this, Senator ALEX-
ANDER: ‘‘It should be as off-limits as
chemical weapons are to warfare.’’
Could Senator ALEXANDER have said it
any more powerfully that shutdowns
are not an option? That is all this reso-
lution says.
Sadly, I think a lot of you are going
to vote no, I suppose, on the theory
that you think: No, if we don’t get our
way, shutting down the government is
our option. That is certainly what you
told Mr. BOEHNER and then Leader
MCCARTHY.
This resolution says, let’s not allow
that to happen again. We now have 3
weeks to avert the next shutdown. I am
hopeful that the Appropriations Com-
mittee will present us with a bipar-
tisan agreement on how best to invest
in border security. We all need to do
our job.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1310 January 30, 2019
Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues
to join us on this resolution to make it
clear to our Federal employees, to our
contractors, to the American people,
and, yes, to the rest of the world that
we don’t believe shutting down the
government of the United States of
America is an option in negotiations.
Vote for this resolution. You know
that shutting down government is not
a positive result of our failures.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, may I
inquire as to how much time I have re-
maining?
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
CÁRDENAS). The gentleman from North
Carolina has 151⁄2 minutes remaining.
The gentleman from Missouri has 8
minutes remaining.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, the comments that we
just heard from the well, from the ma-
jority leader, fail to mention one crit-
ical point about this resolution.
This resolution doesn’t do anything
to stop a future shutdown. It is de-
signed, in its purpose to give cover to a
number on the other side of the aisle
who voted in this very Chamber to not
fund those who were deemed essential
pay at a critical time. In fact, indeed,
the very sponsor of this resolution
voted against giving pay to those men
and women who continue to show up to
vote and now somehow are going to
vote on a resolution and make it all
okay. If we are going to have history,
let’s make sure it is accurate.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN).
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, what is
stupid is not securing the border.
Mr. Speaker, let’s just cut to the
chase. If Democrats would support now
what they supported then, there never
would have been a shutdown. Ten years
ago, all kinds of Senators—Senators
Biden, FEINSTEIN, SCHUMER, Obama,
and Clinton—all supported money for a
barrier on the border.
Senator Obama said this: ‘‘We simply
cannot allow people to pour into the
United States undetected, undocu-
mented, and unchecked. Americans are
right to demand better border security
and better enforcement of our immi-
gration laws.’’
Secretary Clinton said this: ‘‘I voted
numerous times as a Senator to spend
money to build a barrier to try to pre-
vent illegal immigrants from coming
in.’’
Oh, how times have changed.
Where are the Democrats today?
What is the position of the left today?
Congressman BLUMENAUER: Abolish
ICE.
Candidate Clinton: We need a border-
less hemisphere.
The Speaker of the United States
House of Representatives said: Walls
are immoral.
And the person they selected to give
the State of the Union response, a gu-
bernatorial candidate in Georgia, said
she is okay with noncitizens voting.
Oh, how times have changed.
All we are asking for is, do what you
said before, be for what you were for
before, and let’s build a border security
wall.
Let’s focus on one simple thing here.
Let’s do what is best for the country.
Everyone knows a sovereign Nation
should control its borders. Everyone
knows that a border security wall will
help with this caravan phenomena we
have watched over the last several
months. Let’s build a border security
wall. If we can agree on that—and
Democrats were all for it just a couple
of years ago—there never would have
been a shutdown and we would be serv-
ing the American people.
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CONNOLLY).
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I
thank my good friend, Mr. CLAY of Mis-
souri, and a distinguished member of
our committee, for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I hope the American
people are listening to what is being
said here on the floor, because they are
actually getting an honest flavor of
where some of my friends on the other
side of the aisle actually are.
Everybody, Mr. JORDAN says, agrees
we need a wall, a barrier on the border.
Actually, not everybody does. Actu-
ally, most polls show most Americans
don’t support that, and that number is
increasing: the opposition.
Federal workers make more than
their private sector counterparts, de-
spite the fact that the official study
shows they are 31 percent behind their
private sector counterparts, and there
are differences because of the dif-
ferences in the nature of the work.
What you are also hearing, besides
Darwinian ‘‘survival of the fittest’’
rhetoric and Marie Antoinette, ‘‘let
them eat cake’’ kind of rhetoric com-
ing out of this administration and
some Members of this body, which I
think reflects poorly on an under-
standing about where the average
American, including the average Fed-
eral employee, actually is and what
their needs really are—and they don’t
demand much—but respect is some-
thing they do demand, and it is some-
thing we offer them. That is why this
resolution in front of us is so impor-
tant.
Is it that hard to come together?
Yeah, it is nonbinding, but it is aspira-
tional. And even that, apparently,
some of my friends on the other side of
the aisle find difficult to swallow: a
commitment not to shut down govern-
ment for any reason.
Mr. Speaker, let’s not hold Federal
employees, and the American public
they serve, hostage ever again. We will
deal with our policy disputes sepa-
rately, but we won’t engage in shutting
down the Federal Government. It is
disastrous, it is reckless, it is dysfunc-
tional, and it is a disservice to the peo-
ple who sent us here. It is that simple.
Never again shut down government.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. ROY).
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my
friend from North Carolina for yield-
ing.
Mr. Speaker, do you know what is
hard to respond to?
It is hard to respond to my constitu-
ents at home who are witnessing the
theater of the absurd.
It is hard to respond to Laurie
Vargas, a mother in San Antonio, who
lost her son, Jared, last summer to
somebody who was here illegally, who
was captured and released, captured
and released, stopped by law enforce-
ment, and then murdered her son.
It is extremely hard to respond to
our members of the Border Patrol, who
go down to the river, the Rio Grande in
Laredo, and are down there with no
cell signal, have no radio, can’t see the
river through the cane, they are down
there by themselves, they know the
cartels have operational control of the
border, they know their lives are
threatened if they speak out about the
cartels, they know that there are ter-
rorists who are leading cartel organiza-
tions across the border in Nuevo La-
redo, and we are doing nothing to give
them what they need to defend the
United States of America.
I can’t go home to the people in
Texas 21 and explain to them why we
are here for 2 days having show votes
and then leave on a Wednesday. Ex-
plain that. Explain to the people why
we are going to leave this afternoon at
1:00 not securing the border.
It makes absolutely no sense to the
American people when they watch
what happens in this body, and they
wonder how the people’s House leaves
them with an unsecured border and
nothing more than show votes, like we
are going to have today, for political
theater.
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).
b 1245
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the managers of the resolution,
both of them, the gentleman from Mis-
souri and the gentleman from North
Carolina.
I thank Ms. WEXTON and Mr. CON-
NOLLY for capturing the essence of
what this legislation is all about. It is
not contentious. We don’t intend to di-
vide this House. We intend to unify
this House.
But I think as we speak to our col-
leagues and the American people, it is
clear that the opening sentence says
that this body believes that shutdowns
are detrimental to the Nation. That is
a word that I think all of us can join
on.
And if we look at the desperation of
our Federal workers, 800,000—270,000 in
Texas, 4,000 in my district—you see the
opening line: ‘‘My landlord is calling
and I must pay.’’ And the follow-up is:
‘‘I have no money.’’
All that we are saying today is to af-
firm the value of our constituents,

January 30, 2019
from the Coast Guard to FBI, to Cus-
toms and Border Protection, Transpor-
tation Security, and Forest Service
fighters who are on the front lines.
To my good friend from Texas, I
can’t count the times I have been to
the border and seen barriers and fenc-
ing, but what I do know is, yes, SHEILA
JACKSON LEE has voted over and over
for border security here, years ago, and
made the first crunch of dollars that
dealt with increasing Border Patrol
when they were barely in existence by
providing laptops and providing the
kind of vehicles that they needed and
worked with landowners who didn’t
want any kind of fence, stone or other-
wise, but to be able to give them the
support.
Now we need smart border security,
technology with drones, better infra-
structure, more ports of entry. Today,
we hope that will happen, because it
will happen because appropriators are
sitting down.
But can we reflect? This shutdown
was in the midst of Christmas when we
had bills that Republicans and Demo-
crats had signed onto that came from
the Senate. We could vote.
This is saying that whatever our pol-
icy differences are, you never hold a
Federal worker, a person who is serv-
ing his or her Nation, hostage. You
never make them desperate.
You never make them have to call a
congressional office, ‘‘I am about to be
evicted,’’ as my constituent did. We
never let them lose their house. We
never let them bring their children out
of school, as some had to do.
You never let them do as they are
doing in my district right now, going
to get groceries. And you never let
them hear the words: ‘‘Go to a bank. I
don’t know why they just can’t walk
into a bank.’’ Or someone else says: ‘‘It
is okay. They are doing it for their Na-
tion.’’
That is what this is about. It is sim-
ply allowing us to tell a reservist from
the Middle East, Edith Banda, that she
doesn’t have to sell her belongings be-
cause she doesn’t have a job because
she is a Federal worker and she had
been furloughed.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to
support this resolution, and I ask them
to stand for the American people.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support
of H. Res. 79, which expresses the strong
sense of Congress that government shut-
downs are detrimental to the nation and
should never occur again.
I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of
this important resolution that condemns the
President’s callous decision to shut down the
federal government for 35 days, furloughing
800,000 civil servants and forcing nearly half
that many to work without pay, and which
costs the economy more than $11 billion in
lost productivity and economic output.
The collateral damage caused by the Trump
Shutdown was substantial, long lasting, and
unnecessary because it could have been
avoided had the President not reneged on his
promise to sign the continuing resolution
passed by the Senate unanimously on De-
cember 19, 2018.
Because the President broke his promise,
frontline federal employees, including law en-
forcement and public safety personnel, worked
without pay from December 22 through Janu-
ary 25, 2019.
The way these federal workers, many of
whom risk their lives in the service of this
country, were treated was shameful.
This included around 14,000 FBI agents,
54,000 Customs and Border Protection
agents, 47,000 Transportation Security Offi-
cers, and 6,000 Forest Service firefighters.
TSA employees received their last paycheck
on December 28 and this single paycheck had
to stretch much further than originally in-
tended.
The shutdown forced some employees to
look for new jobs or take on extra work, and
the pressure was immense for employees and
families with no other source of income.
Among those not receiving a pay check for
their work were 3,200 Secret Service agents
who risk their lives every single day to protect
President Trump and his family.
Speaker PELOSI’s decision to delay the
State of the Union was in defense of the Se-
cret Service agents who would be forced to
work without pay.
In addition to the federal employees working
without pay, hardworking federal employees at
agencies like the Department of Justice, the
Department of Homeland Security, the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, and NASA had been fur-
loughed without pay, plunging them and their
families into uncertainty.
These are real American families that were
put through an unwarranted and unnecessary
shutdown, and they suffered because of it.
Many federal employees were furloughed,
and those deemed essential were expected to
work without pay.
American families were stuck wondering
how they were going to get by without an in-
come, especially since things like rent, gro-
ceries, children’s prescriptions and general
day-to-day living costs must still be paid
whether the government is fully functional or
not.
The Trump Shutdown ended when the
Speaker PELOSI made the President face re-
ality that the vast majority of the American
people and their representatives in Congress
did not support wasting $5.7 billion on an un-
necessary and immoral wall that the President
promised Mexico would pay for.
Not only were Americans struggling to pay
for their day-to-day expenses but veterans and
military families were suffering as well.
The military was also suffering in other
areas.
For example, changes of station for military
personnel were delayed and facility and weap-
ons maintenance was suspended.
Military commissaries (base grocery stores)
were shut down and military families were
forced to shop elsewhere, costing up to 30
percent more on average than at the com-
missaries.
The United States Coast Guard went with-
out funding for thirty-five days.
This was an added expense that added up
very quickly, especially for military families liv-
ing in cities with a high cost of living.
Edith Banda who recently returned from a
reservist deployment in the Middle East was
among thousands of people in the Houston
area who felt impact of the government shut-
down.
Edith was unable to work her federal job in
downtown Houston for 35 days.
Making matters worse, she and dozens of
others in Houston were unable to seek tem-
porary private sector work because such jobs
require permission, and the people who proc-
ess those requests were also furloughed.
Edith had begun selling her personal pos-
sessions to make ends meet.
There are so many other issues that could
be tackled with the money Trump wants to
spend on the border wall.
With an increase of $265 million the Depart-
ment of Justice could hire 2,000 new police of-
ficers and make steps towards making many
communities a safer place.
With an increase of $99 million the Office of
National Drug Control Policy could support
community-level efforts to address substance
abuse programs in nearly 730 additional com-
munities.
With an increase of $200 million the Eco-
nomic Development Administration could cre-
ate or preserve 31,000 jobs for our hard-
working Americans.
With an additional $20 million Small Busi-
ness Administration grants could support doz-
ens more Women’s Business and Veterans
Outreach Centers providing business training,
counseling and outreach to 47,000 additional
US veterans and women.
These are the changes that American citi-
zens deserve.
Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 79 could not come at
a better time.
Having survived the Trump Shutdown, it is
fitting and proper for the House of Represent-
atives to go on record and state that the shut-
down of the Government of the United States,
or any portion thereof, causes substantial
damage to Federal employees, to every Amer-
ican who benefits directly or indirectly from
Federal services, to our Nation’s economy,
and to the reputation of the United States
around the world.
Mr. Speaker, shutting down the Government
of the United States, or any portion thereof, is
not an acceptable tactic or strategy for resolv-
ing differences regarding policy, funding lev-
els, or governing philosophy.
Given the damage mercilessly inflicted on
the American people and the economy by the
Trump Shutdown, Congress has a fiduciary
duty to the American people to ensure the
continued, uninterrupted operations of the
Government of the United States and its serv-
ices.
I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in
favor of H. Res. 79.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, in con-
sultation with my friend opposite, we
are going to yield to the gentleman
from West Virginia and then recognize
the Republican leader after that, and
then I will be prepared to close.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from West Virginia (Mr.
MOONEY).
Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr.
Speaker, this resolution talks about
not having more government shut-
downs. We don’t need a resolution for
that. Of course, there shouldn’t be gov-
ernment shutdowns. That is why, last
year, this body passed a resolution to
fund government, including Trump’s
border wall that he asked for.
We passed that out of this Chamber.
It went to the Senate. And what did

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1312 January 30, 2019
they do? Nothing. The Senate did noth-
ing. They did nothing for over 30 days.
They just sat while the government
shut down.
Why? Because the minority party in
the U.S. Senate chooses to threaten to
filibuster, and if they don’t get every-
thing they want, based on this threat
to filibuster, they shut down govern-
ment until such time as this Chamber
or the President or whoever they want
to bully around gives them everything.
That is not the way government is sup-
posed to work.
I had a conversation yesterday with a
young man here in D.C. He said: ‘‘How
are you going to end these government
shutdowns? What is going to happen
now?’’
Well, gosh, we have appointed a con-
ference committee. That is how it is
supposed to work. The Homeland Secu-
rity conference committee meets
today. There are four Republicans and
three Democrats, which reflects the
makeup of that Chamber. There are 10
from this Chamber, 6 Democrats and 4
Republicans, which reflects the make-
up of this Chamber.
That is the committee where you
meet and you work these things out.
That is the system the Founders of our
country set up for us here. The problem
is we have gotten away from that. We
do continuing resolutions like we
shouldn’t, and we sit here and one side
has to get everything they want.
Why does it happen that way? Be-
cause one side, the Democratic side,
wants to get everything they want. If
they don’t get everything they want,
they want to shut down government
and then falsely blame everybody else.
That is not the way it is supposed to
work.
I am glad we have a conference com-
mittee. My Senator from West Virginia
SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO is actually on
that conference committee that is sup-
posed to meet today to work out ex-
actly what we are going to do with the
border wall and funding Homeland Se-
curity.
That is what we should do with every
bill. That is why, last year, when we
were in the majority, we actually
passed the appropriations bills over to
the U.S. Senate. Do you know what
they did? Nothing.
It doesn’t take 60 votes to pass a bill.
It takes 60 votes to invoke cloture.
That is different than passing a bill.
The dysfunction in the U.S. Senate
cannot continue to reign in this coun-
try and cause government shutdowns,
particularly when the minority party
wants everything.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for his remarks.
We have dozens of people who are
willing to speak, but in the interest of
time, none more important than the
Republican leader.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from California (Mr.
MCCARTHY).
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding me
the time.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to
H. Res. 79, a glorified press release that
the majority is having this Chamber
spend time on during another yet
underwhelming legislative week.
At a time when the country expects
its leaders in Washington to look for-
ward, this House majority is looking
backwards. When our country expects
solutions, they are using this Chamber
to settle political scores.
As hundreds of thousands of Ameri-
cans painfully experienced, portions of
our Federal Government were shut
down for 35 days, a shameful record
under this majority’s watch. It was a
shutdown that never had to happen.
Let’s recall last December when this
House passed an appropriations bill
that would have funded the govern-
ment, secured the border, and provided
disaster assistance to the millions af-
fected by hurricanes and fires. Most
importantly, it was a bill that would
have been signed into law. This oc-
curred after then-Leader PELOSI de-
clared in the Oval Office earlier that
month that a House majority couldn’t
pass such a bill.
That legislation went to the Senate
and, alas, Senator SCHUMER stopped it.
And in doing so, once again, Senator
SCHUMER shut this government down.
From the moment Senator SCHUMER
blocked consideration of that appro-
priation bill, President Trump and con-
gressional Republicans offered solution
after solution after solution after solu-
tion to solve the challenge. In all, the
President offered four reasonable solu-
tions to end the shutdown and secure
the border.
The Democrats never offered one. In
fact, they went on vacation and polit-
ical fundraisers to Puerto Rico. They
littered this Chamber with messaging
bills that didn’t come close to solving
the problem and would never be signed
into law.
Mr. Speaker, I want to focus on the
very last solution the President of-
fered. I want to focus on it because it
met the Democrats halfway. It was the
truest form of compromise this town
has seen in quite some time. It would
have secured portions of the border
with barriers, and it would have pro-
vided certainty to the very commu-
nities that my friends on the other side
of the aisle have stood on this floor for
countless hours to claim they want to
help.
Instead, Mr. Speaker, the actions of
this majority when presented with that
opportunity and following the shut-
down tell you all you need to know
about who they truly want to help.
Do you know who they want to help?
Themselves.
After the President signed a 3-week
continuing resolution, the Speaker
gloated with a Presidential-style en-
rollment ceremony. Democrats mar-
veled at her exercise of raw political
motivation. Many in the media re-
sponded like they were beat reporters
from their hometown team. This all
sounds like a historic event.
What exactly was everyone cele-
brating? They were celebrating noth-
ing. They were celebrating achieving
nothing. They were celebrating the sta-
tus quo that suits their political inter-
est and personal pursuits of self-right-
eousness, a status quo that causes pain
and suffering for Americans across this
country.
Here are just a few examples:
There have been 266,000 criminal
aliens arrested in the last 2 years. This
includes charges and convictions of
100,000 assaults, nearly 30,000 sex
crimes, and 4,000 violent killings.
Three hundred Americans die every
week from heroin, and more than 90
percent of heroin comes from across
the southern border.
Roughly 10,000 children are being
smuggled into the U.S. every year to be
sold for human trafficking.
They are celebrating a status quo
that leaves 700,000 DACA-designated in-
dividuals unsure about their future.
It was the best display of politics
that this country is sick and tired of
seeing: zero-sum politics and nothing
ever changes.
I would like to spend some time and
reflect on Americans and their families
who may not have been celebrating the
status quo preserved by this majority:

These are just 50 names of Americans

them on the news.
I would like to reflect on others who

Mr. Speaker, as this House adjourns
for the week today—after just one rule
bill—I implore my colleagues to take
some time and think deeply about
these individuals, their families, and
what our country stands for. It cer-
tainly isn’t this political stunt by this
majority, and it certainly isn’t the sta-
tus quo they are so proud to protect.
As Members of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives, we are a very small group
with a very large responsibility. The
burden on us 435 Americans is to rep-
resent 325 million Americans faithfully
and to work together so tomorrow is
better than today. Let us not let these
political distractions get in the way of
our duty. Instead, let’s actually work
together to give a voice to the voice-
less.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, these are powerful
words by our Republican leader. There
has been a lot of debate. I don’t think
a more somber moment have I experi-
enced this week on the House floor
than when the 50 names were read out,
where their loved ones will never be
able to welcome them home. There will
be ball games that are missed. There
will be calls that are no longer made
of, ‘‘Welcome home, Daddy,’’ or ‘‘wel-
come home’’ to a son or a daughter.
Mr. Speaker, we have talked a lot
about the pain and anguish of Federal
employees. Indeed, there are real hard-
ships there that are undeniable. But,
Mr. Speaker, they are getting their pay
back. For the lives of the 50 people who
were just named on this House floor,
there is no returning. Their lives were
extinguished, Mr. Speaker, and we
must do something about that as well.
I am committed to my colleagues op-
posite to work with them to protect
Federal workers, as long as they are
willing to work with us to protect the
communities and the safety of moms
and dads from coast to coast.
On that, it is important that we have
no more show votes. This resolution is
meaningless other than to provide
cover for some on the other side of the
aisle who voted against giving pay to
those who were essential employees.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, let me thank all of the
body for engaging in this debate and
for the minority leader bringing forth
those names. But let me say that H.
Res. 79 is not about the undocumented,
nor is it a political stunt. It is not mes-
saging for some political purpose. This
resolution is about compassion and re-
spect for fellow Americans who happen
to be Federal workers who deserve to
stay on the job and deserve to get a
paycheck, and for the work and the
service that they give to the rest of the
country.
My friends on the other side know
better. They know better, that shut-
downs are harmful to our economy as
well as our national security. They
know that. The Federal Government
should always be open for business, and
Federal employees should not be held
as hostages.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a favorable vote
on the passage of H. Res. 79, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
strong support of H. Res. 79, a resolution ex-
pressing the sense of the House that shut-
downs are detrimental to the Nation and
should not occur.
And as a Member of the Appropriations
Committee, I know firsthand how terrible this
shutdown has been. This past weekend I met
with Coast Guard families impacted by the 35-
day government shutdown.
Families told me they were skipping medica-
tions and couldn’t afford to put gas in the car
because of the shutdown.
Mr. Speaker, these families did nothing
wrong.
In fact, they have gone Above and Beyond
the call of duty by signing up to serve in the
Coast Guard.
And how did President Trump reward their
sacrifices?
By inflicting a needless, 35-day government
shutdown on these families. By using these
families as political pawns.
Let me be clear: these Coast Guard families
deserve far better than this. And so do all our
federal workers—who bore the brunt of this
shutdown through no fault of their own.
The CBO estimates that this shutdown cost
our economy 11 billion dollars—including 3 bil-
lion dollars that will never be recovered.
It also caused immeasurable fear and anx-
iety for families.
So, while we can never fully repair the dam-
age that was caused by this dangerous, irre-
sponsible shutdown, I hope that President
Trump and Congressional Republicans will
take these stories to heart and learn from the
damage they caused.
Simply put, families can’t afford another
shutdown.
So, let’s pass this resolution and get back to
work for the American people. I urge my col-
leagues to vote yes.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.
CLAY) that the House suspend the rules
and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 79,
as amended.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, on that
I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana changed
his vote from ‘‘aye’’ to ‘‘no.’’
Messrs. CLYBURN, COOK, Ms.
FUDGE, Messrs. CARSON of Indiana,
VISCLOSKY, and SMITH of New Jer-
sey changed their vote from ‘‘no’’ to
‘‘aye.’’
So the amendment was agreed to.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
The CHAIR. There being no further
amendments under the rule, the Com-
mittee rises.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.
CÁRDENAS) having assumed the chair,
Mr. SABLAN, Chair of the Committee of
the Whole House on the state of the
Union, reported that that Committee,
having had under consideration the bill
(H.R. 790) to provide for a pay increase
in 2019 for certain civilian employees of
the Federal Government, and for other
purposes, and, pursuant to House Reso-
lution 87, he reported the bill, as
amended by that resolution, back to
the House with sundry further amend-
ments adopted in the Committee of the
Whole.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the rule, the previous question is or-
dered.
Is a separate vote demanded on any
further amendment reported from the
Committee of the Whole? If not, the
Chair will put them en gros.
The amendments were agreed to.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the engrossment and
third reading of the bill.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed
and read a third time, and was read the
third time.
MOTION TO RECOMMIT
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, I have a motion to recommit at the
desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the
gentlewoman opposed to the bill?
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. I am, Mr.
Speaker, in its present form.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit.
The Clerk read as follows:
Mrs. Brooks of Indiana moves to recommit
the bill H.R. 790 to the Committee on Over-
sight and Reform with instructions to report
the same back to the House forthwith with
the following amendment:
At the end of the bill, add the following:
SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON PAY ADJUSTMENT FOR
EMPLOYEES DISCIPLINED FOR SEX-
UAL MISCONDUCT.
During calendar year 2019, no increase in
pay as authorized under this Act may be pro-
vided to any Federal employee who has been
disciplined for sexual misconduct under
chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code, or
any other provision of law.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Indiana is recognized
for 5 minutes in support of her motion.
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, my motion to recommit amends the
Democratic bill by prohibiting tax-
payer dollars from being used to give
raises to Federal employees who have
been disciplined for sexual misconduct.
Without this change, Federal employ-
ees who have engaged in sexual mis-
conduct in the workplace would be re-
warded for their bad actions.
The Republican motion to recommit
amends the bill and reports it back
forthwith with an amendment. If it
passes, the Republican motion to re-
commit will allow an immediate vote
on final passage of the bill.
The underlying premise of the Demo-
cratic bill is that our Federal civilian
workforce should be treated the same
as members of our armed services, who
received a 2.6 percent pay raise in last
year’s NDAA.
The Federal Government is blessed
with amazing Federal employees. As a
former United States attorney, I led an
office of those amazing Federal em-
ployees. I worked with countless other
dedicated Federal employees.
Our dedicated civil servants work
day in and day out to protect and serve
the American public. We are most
grateful for their service.
The vast majority of Federal employ-
ees are hardworking. They don’t en-
gage in conduct unbefitting their civil

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1315
January 30, 2019
service. However, those who have been
disciplined for sexual misconduct
should not be rewarded with a 2.6 per-
cent pay increase.
The bill before the House today
treats every Federal employee the
same. Good, bad, competent, or not,
they all get a pay raise on top of auto-
matic step increases and promotions.
Earlier today, my colleagues have
asked: Doesn’t everyone deserve a pay
raise? The answer is no. A broken dis-
ciplinary process in our Federal agen-
cies make it nearly impossible to fire
anyone. This Democratic bill is noth-
ing short of a handout to individuals
who engage in sexual misconduct in
the workplace, and that is wrong.
How can we reward anyone who
harms Federal employees in this man-
ner? How can we reward people who
abuse the public’s trust in this way?
Let me give you a few past examples.
A 2018 PBS report included inter-
views with 34 current and former fe-
male U.S. Forest Service employees
who alleged discrimination, harass-
ment, and sexual assault at the agency.
Do these employees who perpetrated
this type of behavior deserve auto-
matic raises? No.
In 2017, an NBC affiliate identified al-
most 100 cases of Federal employees
viewing pornography on government
computers. Should these employees be
rewarded for this behavior with auto-
matic pay raises? No.
In 2015, DOJ’s Office of Inspector
General found that DEA agents partici-
pated in sex parties in Colombia in-
volving strippers and prostitutes paid
for by drug cartels. Does this type of
conduct warrant automatic pay raises?
I don’t think so.
A recent study—and this is horrible—
shows that sexual harassment is com-
monplace in Federal offices. One in five
women have experienced harassment in
the workplace, and nearly 9 percent of
male employees report the same. It
took 7 years for a former trial lawyer
from the Justice Department to win a
ruling from the EEOC confirming she
was harassed by two male supervisors.
In 2018, five ICE officials told The
Washington Post the agency hadn’t yet
responded to sexual harassment claims
they filed more than a year ago against
a manager who they said pressured
them to view nude photos.
Our disciplinary process is confiden-
tial and murky. It varies agency by
agency. We don’t know how many em-
ployees have been disciplined for sex-
ual misconduct and still remain on the
job. We have serious faults we must ad-
dress before we give across-the-board
pay raises.
During consideration of this bill in
Rules, there was bipartisan sentiment
to look at longstanding issues that face
our civil servants. Retention, private-
sector wage comparison, and millen-
nial recruitment were some of those
issues. But this was a hastily drafted
bill, and this is not how the process
should work.
b 1345
The American people deserve a Fed-
eral workforce with high standards for
appropriate conduct. Federal employ-
ees should feel safe and protected doing
the people’s business.
Mr. Speaker, we have problems in our
Federal workforce that we must deal
with before we give across-the-board
pay raises.
The Republican motion to recommit
protects due process rights of all Fed-
eral employees by ensuring that only
those substantiated claims for which
an employee has been disciplined will
result in an employee being ineligible
for a pay raise.
It is inexcusable that the Democrat
bill, as drafted, would treat victims of
sexual harassment the same as the per-
petrators who may still be drawing
Federal paychecks. Taxpayer dollars
should not be used to give a pay raise
to these bad actors.
I urge my colleagues to vote for this
motion to recommit; and if it fails, I
urge my colleagues to vote against this
flawed bill.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise
in strong opposition to the slander we
have just heard.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Virginia is recognized for
5 minutes.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I have
rarely heard such cynicism on the floor
of the House of Representatives. Oh,
no. My friends on the other side are
right to kind of cabal because there is
so much cynicism; but this one takes
the cake.
We are here to honor the Federal
workforce, not slander them with in-
sinuation.
To listen to the gentlewoman from
Indiana, one might infer that the Fed-
eral Government is riddled with people
who are guilty of all kinds of nasty,
near crimes and offenses, and should
not be rewarded for it.
I wonder if we would use the same
standard ourselves here in the House of
Representatives. How many in the last
Congress, especially on a particular
side of the aisle, have resigned over
sexual harassment charges? And that
wasn’t insinuation, that was real. So
let’s not have a double standard.
And by the way, I say to my friends,
especially on this side of the aisle, let
us not be distracted by what is really
going on.
We are simply trying, after the worst
shutdown in American history, to say
to our own employees, 2.1 million:
‘‘You are valued. You are respected.’’
To actually vote for this is not only
to say the opposite and deny them a
simple cost of living increase that we
have already given the military; it is,
in fact, to say: By the way, we buy into
this cynicism. We think you are riddled
with guilt by association and insinu-
ation.
So we have an opportunity, in defeat-
ing this MTR, one of the most cynical
I have ever heard, to actually make a
positive statement to our Federal em-
ployees.
Stand up and be heard. Say ‘‘no’’ to
shutdowns. Say ‘‘yes’’ to our Federal
employees, and restore their sense of
respect with our dignity.
Defeat this MTR.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit.
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion to recommit.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the noes appeared to have it.
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 5-
minute vote on the motion to recom-
mit will be followed by 5-minute votes
on:
Passage of the bill, if ordered;
The motion to suspend the rules and
agree to H. Res. 79; and
Agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of
the Journal, if ordered.
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 206, nays
216, not voting 10, as follows:

from ‘‘yea’’ to ‘‘nay.’’
So (two-thirds not being in the af-

The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
Stated against:
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, on
Wednesday, January 30, I missed a vote on
H. Res. 79. Had I been present for the vote
on H. Res. 79, I would have voted ‘‘no.’’

THE JOURNAL
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs.
LURIA). Pursuant to clause 8 of rule
XX, the unfinished business is the
question on agreeing to the Speaker’s
approval of the Journal, which the
Chair will put de novo.
The question is on the Speaker’s ap-
proval of the Journal.
Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour-
nal stands approved.
f
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I
yield to the gentleman from Maryland
(Mr. HOYER), the majority leader, for
the purpose of inquiring as to the
schedule for the week to come.
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I
thank my friend for yielding.
On Tuesday, the House will meet at
12 p.m. for morning-hour debate and 2
p.m. for legislative business following 1
minutes. The House will recess to allow
for a security sweep of the House
Chamber prior to the President’s State
of the Union Address. The House will
meet again at approximately 8:35 p.m.
in a joint session with the Senate for
the purpose of receiving an address
from the President of the United
States. Members are advised that there
will be no votes in the House on Tues-
day.
On Wednesday and Thursday, the
House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-
hour debate and noon for legislative
business.
On Friday, Madam Speaker, the
House will meet at 9 a.m. for legisla-
tive business, with last votes no later
than 3 p.m. We will consider several
bills under suspension of the rules. The
complete list of those suspensions will
be announced by close of business Fri-
day.
In addition, Madam Speaker, the
House will consider H.R. 840, the Vet-
erans’ Access to Child Care Act, intro-
duced by Representatives BROWNLEY
and HIGGINS. This bill would make per-
manent the VA’s childcare pilot pro-
gram and expand it so that veterans
across the Nation who are parents or
grandparents have a convenient, cost-
free option for childcare when they
have VA medical appointments.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1318 January 30, 2019
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, as it
relates to the suspension calendar, I
know, this week, there was an extra
bill added to the suspension calendar
that wasn’t on the list by close of busi-
ness last week. Do you anticipate this
Friday’s list being amended again the
following week, or should that be a
complete list?
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, as I
pointed out, additional items are pos-
sible to be added. We said that last
week. We did add one. It was noticed on
Monday, and we voted on it today. In
effect, we met the 3-day rule, not the
72-hour rule, but that was a suspension.
There may be others that we will add.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker,
clearly, as a suspension, it wasn’t in
the traditional sense—obviously, it
went down. There being a sense of the
House resolution, typically, those are
resolutions where both sides work to-
gether.
I ask the gentleman, do they antici-
pate approaching senses of the House
in a partisan way or, hopefully, in a bi-
partisan way, where we can work to-
gether to get a true sense of the House
that could pass?
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, we
want to move on a bipartisan basis.
The good news was that this resolu-
tion, although it failed to have a two-
thirds vote, did have a bipartisan vote
with more than 20 Republicans voting
for it, which I appreciate. Of course,
the balance voted against the resolu-
tion, which said that shutdowns were
bad.
But we will certainly try to give as
much notice as possible to the gen-
tleman and to his party.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman.
Madam Speaker, as we approach bi-
partisan resolutions, we hope that the
gentleman from Maryland and his side
would work with us on those. It could
have been a resolution that actually
passed, had we been able to work to-
gether and, hopefully, include some
language about border security.
As we look to the conference com-
mittee that is now meeting, as we talk
about border security especially being
the centerpiece of the big debate over
government funding that, hopefully, we
get agreement to, there were reports
that, last week, the Democrat majority
was going to roll out their plan for
homeland security. Ultimately, that
plan wasn’t, in fact, rolled out. Is there
going to be a rollout? As we have these
negotiations——
Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. SCALISE. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland to let him know
that his side said they wouldn’t nego-
tiate during a shutdown. Obviously,
the shutdown is over now. Will there be
a counteroffer now put on the table?
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, as the
gentleman knows, the conference com-
mittee has either met or is meeting. It
is my understanding that Chairwoman
LOWEY is going to have a press con-
ference after the first initial meeting,
so that we are in a conference. That is
good news. I am sure the conferees are
going to talk about proposals that they
have to reach border security.
I might say that, although it appears
to be the central part, in terms of our
perspective, a shutdown is not about
border security or any other particular
issue. It is that it is a bad policy to
shut down the Government of the
United States. Notwithstanding that, I
expect that Chairwoman LOWEY will be
explaining our position in the con-
ference.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I
look forward to hearing that proposal
laid out. As the House and Senate Re-
publican and Democrat conferees meet
together, I do think, and have an opti-
mistic approach, that we are not that
far removed from reaching a deal, if we
can ultimately find a way to put a real
amount on the table that shows how we
can secure the border, as our experts—
the men and women who risk their
lives to secure the border—have sug-
gested in their proposal, if we can come
to a place where we can agree on a way
to actually achieve border security,
and that includes physical barriers.
When the gentleman from Maryland,
I think it was 2 weeks ago, was talking
about some Democrats who were going
over to the White House back then, it
was said that they didn’t have the au-
thority to negotiate. Do the Democrat
conferees have the authority to nego-
tiate on behalf of the Democrat major-
ity in the House?
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. HOYER. Certainly.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate the gentleman’s quick candor.
Madam Speaker, as we wrap this up,
I would ask about an issue that a num-
ber of our Members were concerned
about and hope this is not a trend. In
the House Natural Resources Com-
mittee, the majority, yesterday, as
they were proposing their new rules for
the committee—and each committee,
as we know, proposes their new rules as
a new Congress is sworn in and estab-
lished on a committee level—in the
oath that is administered to men and
women who come before the committee
to testify, the original proposal sug-
gested removing ‘‘so help you God’’
from the oath. One of the Members on
our side noticed that omission and put
an amendment in place to restore ‘‘so
help you God’’ in the oath. Fortu-
nately, that was added back in.
I would ask the gentleman, is this
going to be a trend? Is there going to
be some kind of general movement by
committees to try to remove ‘‘so help
you God’’ from the oaths that are ad-
ministered to witnesses?
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, not as
far as I know.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, hope-
fully, it is not a trend that we see.
Madam Speaker, I know the last few
weeks have been contentious. We have
a lot at stake as we try to get an agree-
ment on something that actually can
work to properly fund the government
and properly secure the border.
I am glad that the conferees are fi-
nally meeting. I hope we don’t see any
attempt to run out the clock, because
we do have a limited amount of time,
although it is far more than enough
time to reach an agreement, if all par-
ties are truly there in earnest, and I do
think they are.
I hope that they put all options on
the table and listen to all the proper
expert testimony that has been given
on why we need to have certain
amounts to secure the border and cer-
tain tactics and techniques and tech-
nology that are all going to be part of
this.
Hopefully, at the end of that discus-
sion, very quickly, they can reach an
agreement that we can then bring to
the House and the Senate and pass in a
bipartisan way that the President can
sign to finally properly fund the gov-
ernment and secure our Nation’s bor-
der.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman.
b 1430
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I share
the gentleman’s view. I hope the con-
ferees can reach an agreement that will
be agreeable to the Democratic Party,
the Republican Party, both the House
and the Senate, and the President.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman and I know we
look forward to welcoming the Presi-
dent of the United States to this House
Chamber on Tuesday night for the
State of the Union Address.
I appreciate the work that we are
going to do together to secure our Na-
tion’s border and properly fund our
government, and unless the gentleman
has something else he would like to
add, I yield back the balance of my
time.

given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker,
today I rise to celebrate the life of Dr.
James Harold Bowles. Dr. Bowles was
born in June 1921, and raised on the
Pea Ridge in Goochland County, Vir-
ginia.
Dr. Bowles served in the U.S. Army
and graduated from Virginia Union
University before attending medical
school and returning home to
Goochland to open his medical prac-
tice. As he began his career serving his
patients, Dr. Bowles continued his
service as the first African American
to serve on the Goochland County
Board of Supervisors where he worked
to strengthen our community for 32
years.
He was a lifetime member of the
NAACP, a trustee of Emmaus Baptist
Church, and an active member of com-
munity organizations across central
Virginia. Above all, he was a beloved
husband, father, brother, uncle, grand-
father, and great-grandfather. He left
an indelible mark on our community.
Madam Speaker, I leave you with the
advice Dr. Bowles frequently gave. May
it guide our work here in this Chamber.
SMILE. S, seek to understand before
being understood; M, make others feel
important; I, it is not about me; L, lis-
ten twice as much as you speak; E, em-
phatically, enthusiastically, and quick-
ly admit it when you are wrong.
When you do this, dialogue can be
easily achieved.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF
WILLIAM R. CARTEAUX
(Mr. BUCSHON asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BUCSHON. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor the legacy of a
great Hoosier, William R. Carteaux,
the President and CEO of the Plastics
Industry Association, and a dedicated
supporter of the U.S. plastics industry
which employs nearly 1 million Ameri-
cans.
Mr. Carteaux passed away on Decem-
ber 10, 2018, after bravely fighting leu-
kemia. Having worked with Bill, his
passion for the U.S. plastics industry,
which employs more than 50,000 Hoo-
siers and more than 10,000 in my dis-
trict alone, was unmatched.
Bill pushed the entire industry to
focus on recycling and sustainability,
bringing together industry leaders and
innovators to find effective market-
based solutions to our environmental
challenges.
Bill was first diagnosed with leu-
kemia in 2016, and he set out to beat
the disease for himself and others. He
eventually chaired the Washington
area Leukemia & Lymphoma Society
and raised hundreds of thousands of
dollars.
The U.S. plastics industry is stronger
today because of Bill’s efforts, and he
will be sorely missed.
Our thoughts and prayers are with
his wife, Daniele, and his two daugh-
ters, as we honor his legacy and impact
here in the House today.
f
RECOGNIZING NEW MEXICO ORGA-
NIZATIONS THAT SUPPORTED
FEDERAL EMPLOYEES DURING
THE SHUTDOWN
(Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize the food banks and organizations
across New Mexico that supported Fed-
eral employees, contractors, and their
families during the shutdown.
I especially want to thank Arlene
Murillo and the Border Patrol Agent
Family Network in Sunland Park, New
Mexico. It was an honor to witness
their collaborative work, to feed their
neighbors who were affected by the
shutdown, or otherwise fighting hunger
for other reasons.
New Mexicans were among the hard-
est hit when the government stopped
paying its bills, but these organiza-
tions showed what it is to be New
Mexicans, and embody the value to al-
ways have your neighbor’s back.
Now that the damage and disruption
of the shutdown is over, we as a Con-
gress have a responsibility to ensure it
never happens again. That is why I
joined fellow freshman and signed on to
the Shutdown to End All Shutdowns
Act yesterday, to keep hardworking
Americans from paying the price for
Washington’s brokenness.
Madam Speaker, I invite my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to do
the same.
f
HONORING THE LIFE OF FIRE
CHIEF JOHN WEAVER
(Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker,
today I rise to honor one of Lancaster
County’s most honored public servants
and a true hero, former Denver Fire
Company Chief, John Weaver, who
passed away on January 26.
John served our community for 50
years. He became a junior fireman
when he was just 14 years old. He later
joined the Denver Fire Company when
he was 18, in 1969.
He held every officer position, includ-
ing fire chief. He became a fire instruc-
tor, and most recently, he was one of
the primary drivers for the fire depart-
ment. He was a brave man who helped
make the fire department what it is
today.
John was also an entrepreneur who
founded a manufacturing company,
Weaver Industries. Beyond working for
the fire company and saving lives
there, John was also involved in our
community. He believed in giving back
and serving others.
He served on the Cocalico School
Board for 12 years, and coached golf
and bowling. John found great joy in
helping people and set a wonderful ex-
ample for all of us.
He leaves behind a wife, three sons,
and four grandchildren. May we re-
member his giving spirit and may he
rest in peace.
f
HONORING THE LIFE OF JACK
SHIFREL
(Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute and to revise
and extend her remarks.)
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy
heart that I rise to honor the life of
Jack Shifrel, a distinguished Army vet-
eran, former Broward County Public
Schools school board member, fierce
veterans’ advocate, and most impor-
tantly, my friend for 30 years.
Mr. Shifrel served as president of the
Broward Veterans Coalition and was
always on the front lines in responding
to the critical needs of our community.
He worked tirelessly to make sure the
men and women who served our Nation
maintained their dignity and well-
being.
Jack was an indomitable civic force
and had a lifelong passion for politics,
serving 10 4-year terms as a Demo-
cratic Party committeeman in
Broward County.
He was a passionate advocate for the
underserved, a defender of civil rights,
and someone who helped make Broward
County a kinder, more compassionate
community.
He was a dear friend and embodied
the best of what it means to give back
to your country and your community.
Although Jack is no longer with us,
his legacy lives on through veterans
that he served with, and the countless
individuals whose lives he changed for
the better.
Jack Shifrel was one of a kind, a self-
less, compassionate, and tireless advo-
cate for others in Broward County. He
was a patriot in the truest sense, and
will be profoundly missed, but never
forgotten.
f
RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE
OF SCHOOL CHOICE
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the importance of
school choice. Last week was National
School Choice Week when individuals
from all over the country gathered to
raise awareness of different education
options available to parents and their
kids.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1320 January 30, 2019
In my home State of Florida, we are
blessed to have access to traditional
public schools, charter schools, magnet
schools, private schools, online learn-
ing, and home schooling. These diverse
programs provide kids with different
opportunities to excel in the learning
environment that works best for them.
I think specifically of Hunter Frost,
a young man with autism who I have
gotten to know very well. Hunter at-
tended Pepin Academies, a tuition-free
charter school in our district that spe-
cializes in teaching students with
learning and learning-related disabil-
ities.
Hunter thrived at Pepin Academies,
graduating third in his class. He went
on to receive his associate’s degree
from Hillsborough Community College
with an A average and has been accept-
ed by my alma mater, the University of
South Florida, where he plans to begin
this fall.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to have
Hunter as an intern in my office, and I
look forward to his success and to see-
ing him excel in college and beyond.
f
SOLIDARITY IN SALARY
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam
Speaker, I rise today in support of the
Solidarity in Salary Act, which would
withhold paychecks from Members of
Congress, the President, and the Vice
President during a shutdown.
Everyone right now is trying to fig-
ure out who won the shutdown and who
lost it. Well, here is the deal: Nobody
won this thing, but the American peo-
ple lost. We failed them. We turned our
back on them, and they suffered.
Keeping the government open and
running is our most basic responsi-
bility. It is what our constituents ask
of us. In just 3 weeks we managed to
make them question whether Members
of Congress were born without common
sense, or whether we just get a frontal
lobotomy after we are sworn in. And
what did we get out of putting them
through this misery? Nothing.
All that happened is we arrived at
the same basic truth that we knew 5
weeks ago: that we had a deal. In these
Halls we love to kiss up to vets, and
cops, and firemen. All we do is thank
them for their service, and rightfully
so, because they put it all on the line
each and every day.
But it is time that we actually try to
emulate their service here. Because
what they do, what they have to en-
dure is that when they fail at their job,
people die. People get hurt, and they
have to live with that for the rest of
their lives.
All this bill is talking about is us
having skin in the game and not get-
ting paid. We, as Members of Congress,
should be feeling the same pain that we
just inflicted on the American people.
SHUTDOWN TO END ALL
SHUTDOWNS
(Mrs. CRAIG asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Mrs. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, like
many of my colleagues, I came to
Washington to work across the aisle
and create economic opportunities for
Minnesota families.
Since I have gotten here, I have regu-
larly met with Democrats and Repub-
licans to discuss the issues so many
Americans talk about around the
kitchen table: better schools for their
children, a fair shot at economic secu-
rity for their family, and healthcare
they can afford.
We have also discussed over the last
several weeks the shutdown. This must
never happen again. Yesterday, I joined
many of my colleagues, freshman col-
leagues, to introduce a bill to prevent
another shutdown, the Shutdown to
End All Shutdowns Act.
This would prevent Federal workers
from being used as pawns in future po-
litical negotiations. Our bill creates
strong incentives to prevent another
shutdown from occurring by with-
holding pay from Members of Congress
and the executive branch, while forcing
lawmakers to remain in Washington
until a deal is reached.
Additionally, the bill ensures that
the government will continue running,
even if we can’t get to an appropria-
tions bill.
Americans deserve better. We can do
better for them. I urge my colleagues
to join me in supporting the Shutdown
to End All Shutdowns Act and take a
stand to never put politics over the
American people again.
f
VIETNAMESE LOC HUNG GARDEN
EVICTION
(Mr. CORREA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, today
I rise to bring attention to the Viet-
namese Government’s violence and op-
pressive attacks on its own citizens in
Loc Hung garden. For generations,
families have thrived in this farming
community, Loc Hung garden. They
raised their children and care for their
elders.
These citizens are law-abiding citi-
zens, yet, the Vietnamese Government
sent over 1,000 officers to destroy this
community and displace over 200 fami-
lies.
There was no due process, no day in
court, and no compensation. Instead,
the Vietnamese Government took land
by force from its own citizens.
These tactics cannot go unnoticed,
and the world must call this out for
what it is: tyranny. I ask the Viet-
namese Government to allow these
families to return to their homes.
On behalf of the thousands of Viet-
namese citizens living in Orange Coun-
ty, I ask the Vietnamese Government
to cease its behavior, cease these op-
pressive tactics, and let the Viet-
namese people live in peace and return
to their land where they have been liv-
ing for generations.

ETHICS IN PUBLIC SERVICE IN-
CLUDED IN THE FOR THE PEO-
PLE ACT
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker,
the American people sent us here to
clean up corruption and make Wash-
ington work for them. Restoring public
trust in our system of government has
to be one of our top priorities.
I am proud that the very first legisla-
tion I introduced this Congress is
aimed at strengthening ethics rules
and slowing the revolving door between
industry lobbyists and executive
branch agencies.
We need to bolster the firewall be-
tween public service and corporate lob-
bying to ensure public servants are
putting the needs of the people first,
not the industries they regulate.
I am very pleased the Ethics in Pub-
lic Service Act was included in H.R. 1,
the For the People Act, the first major
government reform package we will
consider this Congress. This bill will go
a long way toward elevating the peo-
ple’s voice in our politics by restricting
the influence of dark money in cam-
paigns, defending voting rights protec-
tions, and limiting corporate influence.
Working together, we can build a
government more responsive and effec-
tive in making progress for the Amer-
ican people.

THE SHUTDOWN TO END ALL
SHUTDOWNS
(Ms. SLOTKIN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1

marks.)
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to speak about the bill that I in-
troduced called the Shutdown to End
All Shutdowns, or SEAS, Act, along
with 21 of my fellow freshmen.
This bill will stop the use of govern-
ment shutdowns as a tool in political
debate and ensure that our Federal
workers are never again held hostage
when Congress and the President’s of-
fice cannot agree.
Under this act, if a deal cannot be
reached, Members of the House, the
Senate, the Executive Office of the
President, and his political appointees
will have their pay suspended and their
travel from D.C. curtailed.
To my fellow Michiganders: This bill
was because of you. You asked me why

ees, and FDA employees were punished

because of something they had nothing
to do with. And I heard you.
To my fellow Members of Congress
who may be reticent to support a bill
that penalizes ourselves: This is a mo-
ment of leadership. This is a moment
to acknowledge that we may not have
started this shutdown, but it is our re-
sponsibility to prevent them from hap-
pening in the future.
Madam Speaker, I implore my col-
leagues to do the right thing and sup-
port this bill.

ISSUES OF THE DAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. GOHMERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority
leader.
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, it
has been an interesting day, perhaps
more than most.
We have heard over and over again
about Republicans supposedly causing
the shutdown, but in my days as a trial
lawyer, judge, chief justice, it is always
good to look at the evidence. And the
evidence is very clear.
You had Republicans in the House
and Senate and the President actually
pass a spending bill in the House before
the end of December, and the only
thing that was keeping it from getting
through the Senate was that Demo-
crats there, led by Senator SCHUMER,
would not negotiate. They arrived at
no agreement to get 60 votes so that it
could go forward with debate. That
wasn’t the Republicans.
In the position of the White House,
President Trump made clear: This is
negotiable, but we do need wall, we
need barrier. Call it whatever you
want.
He moved from talking about con-
crete to talking about the steel barrier.
And having spent time with some other
Members of Congress, invited by Con-
gressman BIGGS and Congressman
GOSAR down to the Arizona border, we
saw a lot of it. And then it would just
end. And then you saw a clear path
right around the end of it as people
kept coming, invading this country il-
legally.
From the border patrolmen, it was
clear some were carrying big loads of
drugs. Sometimes they are able to
catch them, sometimes they are not.
And it sounds like, from the times I
spent on the border south of McAllen,
southeast of McAllen, the Texas quad-
rant, more often than not, they don’t
catch the drugs coming in. It is an in-
vasion. It is a huge problem.
And I was hearing people, friends
across the other side of the aisle, some
Senators who are Democrats, acknowl-
edging: Yes, we need to do something.
But when it came to negotiating, there
was no negotiation.
So we had this bill today decrying
how horrible shutdowns are. But if you
look at the tactics, when the tactics of
the leaders—and I say at least some of
the leaders—of one party are ‘‘we are
not going to negotiate; we are not
going to compromise; we are not going
to do what is best for the country,’’ in
effect, as they have stated on prior oc-
casions, as they have voted on prior oc-
casions, some of them, that is what
causes a shutdown.
You know, we did not need this shut-
down. We shouldn’t have had to have
this shutdown. It should have been
agreed back in December by at least
some of the Senators so that we could
have gotten a spending bill.
Of course, we had spending passed on
three-fourths of the government. It was
about one-fourth of the government
that was not funded. So we talk about
a shutdown. It wasn’t a full shutdown.
But, still, it did harm to those who
were not getting paid.
But as I would go through airports—
and TSA agents would know who I
was—numerous times I was told: We
are hurting not getting paid, but we
are all right. We are going to be a
whole lot worse off if we don’t get a
wall or a barrier or something built
and start securing the border.
We heard from teachers who were
saying: We love our kids, we want to
teach them, but it is so unfair to the
students who are already there to have
people brought in and say you have got
to educate these, and they don’t speak
English. And the teachers would say it
really did damage, it does damage to
those students that we are supposed to
also teach. And now, all of a sudden, we
have people we have to teach who don’t
speak English.
There are some school districts that
have done a great job of trying to work
around that and teach English in an
immersion-type setting so that we can
help people not be relegated to manual
labor the rest of their lives, but help
them speak good English so that they
can get good jobs.
But we need a barrier in some places
on the border where we don’t have it,
and that is clear. You can’t just have a
20-, 30-foot barrier just proceeding
along that is stopping the drugs, stop-
ping the sex trafficking, stopping the
human trafficking, and then just stop
it. Because, as we saw down the Ari-
zona border, the path goes for miles
and miles, and it comes right up to the
point where the barrier ends, and it
goes right around.
In one place, there is a little barbed
wire gate that is held to the barrier.
This massive barrier is held with a lit-
tle, probably a quarter-inch, nylon
rope. And they leave it in a slip knot so
you can open the gate and the drugs
can come pouring in that will kill
Americans.
Something had to be done. And yet
what happened was the President was
willing to negotiate, KEVIN MCCARTHY
and the Republicans were willing to ne-
gotiate, Senator MCCONNELL and the
Republicans in the Senate were willing
to negotiate, and yet the word from
our Speaker was: We are not negoti-
ating at all on a barrier, a wall.
So we continued to have people in
the interim, while the government was
shut down, continue to die as a result
of us not securing our border.
We were told by Border Patrol, every
day, there are women who are pulled
into sex trafficking. Every day, there
are women—often young girls. We are
told about one-third of the girls who
are brought up to bring them into the
United States illegally are raped at
least once and, normally, multiple
times.
As long as we keep our border so un-
secured, that is going to continue. I
mean, how much lack of compassion do
you have to have to say: ‘‘We are fine
with the rape trees; we are fine with
one-third of the girls coming into the
United States illegally having been
raped. We are fine. We just leave things
like they are. That is fine, but we are
not going to negotiate because.
Apparently, from what we are hear-
ing, even though many of the people
who refuse to negotiate have talked
about the need for barriers and talked

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1322 January 30, 2019
about the need for securing the border,
they were very concerned that the
President would get a political win by
getting even part of a wall or barrier.
So people are just going to have to
keep suffering, getting raped and
dying.
So we didn’t secure the border, there
is no additional wall, so they can claim
the President didn’t keep his promise
on the wall. That was more important
than saving lives, saving rapes from
happening. It is all about politics.
And that is not across the aisle. I
have talked to too many friends across
the aisle that, if we had been left to
our own resources, we could have
worked something out.
b 1500
But apparently, at the top, it was
more important to keep a political win
from the President than it was to do
what was right for the country.
I don’t know anybody on our side of
the aisle who loves shutdowns, but
there were some claims made in the
bill that went too far, so most of us
voted ‘‘no.’’
We don’t want a shutdown, the same
way we don’t want anybody in our
military dying. But, if we never had
any military willing to risk their lives,
we wouldn’t have the freedoms we have
today.
If we didn’t have a President willing
to put a stake in the sand and say: We
have got to do something to secure our
border. We need some barrier, wall,
whatever you want to call it in some
places. And I will negotiate. The
amount is negotiable—he came down to
about a fifth of what he had been say-
ing and what we are told really needs
to be spent, $25 billion or so. Yet there
was no negotiation on the other side.
I know there was one dollar men-
tioned, apparently in jest: Oh, I would
give a dollar for a wall.
But it just seems so hypocritical to
have a leader, or leaders, that would
not negotiate in good faith, which
caused a shutdown, with one side will-
ing to negotiate on everything except
we have got to have some barriers
someplace and no negotiation on the
other side.
Then we come in here with a bill
today to condemn shutdowns that were
caused by a refusal of one side to nego-
tiate. Like I said, I know that is not
the case.
There is an article here from the
Washington Examiner, Anna Giaritelli.
It says: ‘‘House Republicans say at
least 60 Democratic lawmakers have
indicated in the past few weeks that
they support some type of barrier,
wall, or fence at the U.S.-Mexico bor-
der, even as Democratic leaders say
they won’t agree to President Trump’s
border wall.’’
It is just amazing that that ends up
being the climactic bill today, con-
demning shutdowns, after the leader-
ship on one side says: We are not com-
promising; we are not moving an inch.
It causes a shutdown; we will blame
that on you. We will even pass a bill.
We have got a majority. We can pass a
bill, you know, that condemns shut-
downs.
They took out the language, thank-
fully, that blames the Republicans.
But I would like to recognize my
very dear friend from Pennsylvania for
his comments and observations.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
PERRY).
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, we are
here today to talk a little bit about
what we just saw, which is what the
gentleman from Texas is talking about,
this vote that we just had with the con-
demnation of shutdown.
Let’s just be clear. Nobody—nobody—
in this House, whether it be Democrat,
Republican, conservative, liberal, any-
where in between, or in the Senate, no-
body votes for shutdown. There is no
bill that says: Are you voting ‘‘yea’’ to
shut down the Federal Government or
are you voting ‘‘nay’’? That is not how
this goes.
What happens is we are trying to
fund. It is an appropriations bill. And
‘‘appropriation’’ is a fancy way of just
saying: We are taking your tax dollars,
and this what we are spending. This is
our priority. This is how we are spend-
ing it.
There is a disagreement, and we can’t
come to an agreement. Nothing hap-
pens. That is the problem: nothing hap-
pens. So the Federal Government shuts
down.
Now, we had a discussion earlier on
when I said: Look, we are having this
vote today to condemn this horrible
thing. That doesn’t fix anything. It
doesn’t solve a thing. It is just theater.
And the American people and our coun-
try have big issues at stake that we
need to get to solving. This doesn’t
solve anything.
This is just: Let’s make sure we place
blame where we think blame is so we
can pound our chest and feel good and
we can—oh, by the way—cover for
some of our Members who voted ‘‘no’’
on paying Federal employees who were
working. That is what this was all
about.
It is in the past. It is in the past. But
right now we should be talking about
the negotiation which caused this
whole thing in the first place.
Quite honestly, you should be able to
talk and chew gum at the same time,
which is: Let’s have a discussion about
what is appropriate at the border and
keep all of the Federal Government
open at the same time. But, no, we
can’t do that because we are not inter-
ested in securing our border.
That is really what this is all about.
This is the Homeland Security appro-
priations bill. And if you are not talk-
ing about securing the border in the
Homeland Security appropriations bill,
I don’t know where you are going to
talk about it.
So, again, no one wants a shutdown.
No one voted for a shutdown.
But I reminded the majority party
that, in December, this House, under
Republican leadership, voted for a bill
that would have kept the government
open and, in walking and chewing gum
at the same time, provided for border
security that the President would have
signed.
The majority leader said: You guys
voted on a bill after waiting for a year
that you knew couldn’t pass.
Well, during that period of a year,
the reason it couldn’t pass is the rea-
son it didn’t pass in the Senate: be-
cause Senate Democrats refused to
fund border security.
Now, I believe they are for border se-
curity, but if it says ‘‘the wall,’’ well,
that is President Trump, and we cer-
tainly can’t have any of that. I would
say we have got to get past that.
Look, you can dislike the President
all you want. That is your prerogative.
But don’t translate your dislike for the
President into not caring for the secu-
rity of the American people. And that
is what has happened here.
We are now in January, at the end of
January. We don’t know what the num-
bers for January are. We don’t know
the numbers for December yet. But
Homeland Security reported in Novem-
ber, between the ports of entry, be-
tween the points of entry, 51,000 people
were apprehended coming across our
border. We don’t know how many
weren’t apprehended. We just know we
got 51,000.
My friends on the other side of the
aisle say: We are for border security, so
we want some drones and more tech-
nology and beef up the points of entry.
We are not opposed to that, but we
are saying, generally, that is status
quo, right? We are talking about fixing
the status quo. We are not talking
about doing anything in between the
points of entry, which is what the dis-
cussion really is all about.
And the President is willing to do
things at the points of entry and in be-
tween, but some folks are not, and that
is where we are having a problem.
Mr. GOHMERT. The gentleman men-
tioned the 51,000. That is just, as I un-
derstand, those who were apprehended.
Mr. PERRY. In 1 month.
Mr. GOHMERT. In 1 month. That is
not everybody that was coming in.
My friend, being a general in the
United States Army, served our coun-
try so meritoriously. We had a situa-
tion under President Woodrow Wilson
where a small part of Pancho Villa’s
gang came across the border into the
United States, killed some families,
and then went back into Mexico.
Devout Democrat that Woodrow Wil-
son was, he apparently saw that small
incursion as an invasion. He sent—and
I have asked the Congressional Re-
search Service for their best numbers,
and the estimate, taken from articles
and information they had gotten, was
probably around 75,000 of a new group
called the National Guard—new back
in the early 1900s.
He sent them down to stand guard on
the border—75,000—and sent General
John Pershing down into Mexico pur-
suing Pancho Villa’s troops. They

didn’t ever get him; they got a lot of
his lieutenants. But, apparently, when
75,000 people were put on the border,
there was no more invasion.
If you look at the U.S. Constitution,
Article IV, Section 4—this is our Con-
stitution—says: ‘‘The United States
shall guarantee to every State in this
Union a Republican form of govern-
ment, and shall protect each of them
against invasion.’’
Now, 51,000 in a month is many,
many times more than the folks that
Pancho Villa had come in and kill
Americans. Would the gentleman con-
sider that an invasion, what we have
going on on our southern border?
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
PERRY).
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I am
not sure what else to call it.
We are a generous people, and I, my-
self, am the product of legal immigra-
tion through Ellis Island. We want to
remain that way. The United States is
the most generous nation on the planet
in that regard, I think last year admit-
ting, legally, about 1.7 million people
into our country.
All we are saying is: Listen, please
just knock on the door. We have a
process here. We have got to do it the
right way. Don’t just barge in. Just
ring the doorbell.
But these folks are saying: Well, we
don’t want to ring the doorbell.
You can clearly see why, if you are
trafficking in little girls or young men,
if you are trafficking in the 90-plus per-
cent of heroin coming across the border
and into every single town, laced with
fentanyl.
If you are trafficking in MS–13, you
are not going to go to the point of
entry and say: ‘‘Hey, Mr. Border Pa-
trolman, I have got this stash of drugs
here. You don’t mind if I bring this
into your country.’’ No, you are going
to go where they are not.
The President is saying this is where
we need to secure our border as well, as
well as the points of entry.
Again, I don’t understand why we are
in this mutually exclusive position. I
don’t think that Democrats don’t want
to secure the border, but securing the
border has to be more, something more
than putting a drone up in the sky so
that we can see them coming.
The point is that they don’t get
across the border, not just to see them
coming, but that they don’t get onto
our side of the border with whatever
they are bringing and that we interdict
them. That is the issue here.
So I think we should be closer than
we are, and I would urge my colleagues
on the other side of the aisle to just ap-
peal to their better angels.
We don’t have to side with the car-
tels. Republicans and Democrats can be
together and siding with the American
people and securing America and its
people from this unsafe circumstance,
whether it is gang members and gang-
related violence, whether it is drugs
coming into our community, or wheth-
er it is low-skilled labor that puts our
low-skilled labor—there are people in
America, believe it or not, who don’t
graduate high school, and they have a
hard time finding a job because they
don’t have an education.
Not only are they competing against
the things that they have in their own
circumstance—right?—of not having an
education in their own country, but
now they are competing against other
people who don’t have a high school
education from another country, who
are willing to work for less than they
are.
If we don’t stand up for the least of
those in our community who have the
least, who have the worst disadvantage
against them, our constituents, who is
going to?
I would say to my friends on the
other side of the aisle: It is really time
to stop with the theater here and the
blame game. It is what it is now. No-
body votes for a shutdown. Nobody
votes for a shutdown. But stop with all
that, and let’s get to real, live negotia-
tions.
You don’t have to side with the car-
tels. You can side with the American
citizens. You don’t even have to con-
sider it siding with the President of the
United States if you find that
unpalatable. You can side with the citi-
zens in your community who don’t
want MS–13, who don’t want heroin,
who don’t want fentanyl, who don’t
want people stealing their wages from
the citizens in their community.
So I would just appeal to them. I
know their heart is good, so we just
ask them to negotiate in good faith.
The good gentleman from Texas and
I will be here when they come up with
their plan. We have asked—right?—for
30-some days: What is your plan? We
know you don’t like the President. We
got that. But what is your plan? Have
we seen it? I haven’t seen anything yet,
right? I haven’t seen their proposal
yet.
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I do
want to hit one point that the gen-
tleman made about the drones. They
can help. The television cameras, all of
the sophistication, the technology, can
help.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania
was not here when $8 billion, as I re-
call, was passed in the House and Sen-
ate, signed by the President, and given
to protect our southern border for, the
terminology I recall, a virtual wall.
And that was not a wall but cameras,
airplanes, drones, whatever they could
get, whatever they needed, whether it
was microphones, listening—it was
whatever the Secretary of Homeland
Security thought appropriate.
There was a provision that was added
in the Senate that became part of the
law that said, if the Secretary of
Homeland Security decides that money
is not going to accomplish the purpose
of securing the border, then she can
wave that off and spend the money
elsewhere.
That is what Secretary Napolitano
did, as I recall. She waved it off.
I have been trying to find out for a
number of years now: Where did that $8
billion go that was supposed to be for
this technology that we are hearing
from some across the aisle: That is all
we need is that?
Well, not one single Democrat did I
ever hear say: Do you know what?
Napolitano shouldn’t have waved off a
virtual wall.
b 1515
They agreed that just wasn’t going to
do it. Secretary Napolitano said that is
not going to do it. That is not going to
help secure the border.
That is all we hear in response to
President Trump saying wall, barrier.
Whatever you want to call it, it is what
we need there.
I yield to my friend, Mr. PERRY.
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I can’t
speak to what happened in the past,
and I don’t know where the money
went either, but I know where we are
today.
I know that our communities are in
peril for these issues that we have dis-
cussed already. I am sure, coming from
Texas, you can name people’s names. I
can name people who have been mur-
dered, who have died of overdoses. Even
if you are just an average taxpaying
citizen in Pennsylvania—I don’t know
about other States—but in Pennsyl-
vania, we pay at least $1.3 billion annu-
ally just for illegal immigration in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and
that doesn’t include healthcare and so-
cial services. That is education and in-
carceration. And we are 2,000 miles
from the border.
If you are a senior citizen in Pennsyl-
vania, where our property taxes are
high, you have paid your mortgage,
you are no longer working, you are on
a fixed income, you are counting on
your retirement and maybe your Social
Security and your savings, and the
price tag keeps going up because people
keep coming into your community ille-
gally. You are in peril of losing your
home, you are looking to your rep-
resentatives and saying: Sir, ma’am,
what are you doing about this prob-
lem? We cannot accept this. We don’t
want to lose our home to pay for this
problem that shouldn’t be happening.
Regardless of what happened in the
past, I can’t fix that. But what we are
saying in this House, as Republicans, is
the status quo of 51,000 people in 1
month getting caught between the
entry points cannot continue. It is too
much. It must be stopped. We must do
something.
If the other side has a better plan,
God bless them. I am ready to sit down
and look at it, but we have been wait-
ing for it since December 20-something.
It is now the end of January. We are
prepared. The gentleman from Texas,
the Representative from Texas, and I
are willing to consider whatever they
have, but we don’t have anything so
far.
This President has offered, I think,
four or five times things that they

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1324 January 30, 2019
have wanted and said: Let’s come to
the table.
We can’t fix it on our own. We need
their involvement. We need their input.
We just beseech them: Let’s get past
all this theater. Let’s get down to brass
tacks here and start saving our com-
munity.
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I
appreciate my friend from Pennsyl-
vania so much for sharing his
thoughts. It continues to be a problem
every day.
An article here from The Hill, by
Madison Gesiotto, says: ‘‘The Mexican
Government is doing more to combat
illegal immigration into the United
States than the entire Democratic
Party put together. While the Demo-
crats continue to pretend the crisis on
our southern border is imaginary, Mex-
ico is heavily investing in border secu-
rity in anticipation of yet another
massive caravan of migrants heading
for the United States.’’
It goes on: ‘‘Hundreds of Honduran
migrants began their journey in hopes
of seeking asylum at our southern bor-
der, a goal that proved elusive to the
previous caravan. Instead of dismissing
the new caravan as a ‘manufactured
crisis’ as the Democrats did after
President Trump made his appeal . . .
Mexican authorities sprang into ac-
tion, announcing a list of strengthened
requirements to address the problem.
‘‘According to the latest reports, the
Mexican Government is reinforcing all
the entry points along its own southern
border with additional immigration en-
forcement agents and is stepping up
surveillance of known illegal crossing
points. It also plans to enforce strict
immigration protocols, such as requir-
ing the migrants to undergo biometric
scans and acquire immigration docu-
ments before they can enter the coun-
try.’’
So that is Mexico. We have worked
on a bill in the past that said, if you
think the Mexican law is so much bet-
ter than ours, why don’t we just adopt
the policies and the laws of Mexico,
with regard to immigration? The bot-
tom line is, if we were to do that, we
wouldn’t have millions of illegal immi-
grants in this country.
I have to give the President some
credit here. When we see this article
from Reuters, an unlikely source, it
points out: ‘‘The United States sent the
first Central American asylum seeker
back to Mexico through a crossing at
the border city of Tijuana on Tuesday
as part of a hardened immigration pol-
icy, an official at Mexico’s National
Migration Institute said.’’
Somebody has been doing some amaz-
ing negotiating in order to make that
happen, where Mexico would agree to
take back some folks who are claiming
asylum. As I understand it, we may
have more people going back to Mex-
ico, pending their hearing.
As we heard from Secretary Nielsen
back in December before our com-
mittee, where there are walls and bar-
riers in place, it cuts illegal immigra-
tion by 90 to 95 percent. That is some-
thing that works. Nothing is going to
work 100 percent, but that is amazing
at how well it works.
I now yield to my good friend, Con-
gressman GAETZ.
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Texas for yielding.
As we gather here on the floor, the
gentleman from Texas and I would note
that most Americans are working on a
Wednesday afternoon at 3:20 eastern
time. Most Americans are trying to ad-
vance their careers, their lives, their
families. I am just tragically dis-
appointed at the lack of work going on
in this Congress.
I think one of the reasons that we
haven’t been so productive is that we
have not seen the Democratic majority
put on this floor what their border se-
curity legislation even is. I know what
the Republican view is as we head into
conference. I know that because Speak-
er PELOSI, in the White House, told the
President we could not pass a border
security bill here. Directly following
that challenge, we came to the floor.
We prioritized our borders, our laws,
the rule of law. We prioritized the
wages of American families, the safety
of communities throughout our coun-
try. And we passed $5.7 billion for bor-
der funding for a barrier and sent that
over to the Senate.
I just don’t understand, Madam
Speaker, why the challenge that the
Democrats gave Republicans is one the
majority is unwilling to meet. If Demo-
crats have a bill, put it on the floor.
Show us what the majority’s ideas are.
Madam Speaker, there has been a
conference committee that has been
appointed. It will get together, and I
sure hope that conference report pro-
duces something that looks like a
whole lot of border security, a whole
lot of barrier and wall and fencing.
I only can imagine the challenge my
Republican colleagues must have, be-
cause Democrats know what Repub-
licans want, but we don’t know what
Democrats want, so it is kind of hard
to negotiate.
We have to have a win-win to get out
of this system where we seem to careen
from shutdown to shutdown and crisis
to crisis as a mechanism to gain lever-
age against one another for our respec-
tive priorities. But the right thing to
do is to just put on the floor what you
believe in.
I know what Republicans believe in
because we voted for it. That seems to
be a fair challenge back to those who
are currently in the majority. I thank
my colleague from Texas for yielding.
Mr. GOHMERT. I am very grateful to
my friend, Congressman GAETZ, for
that insightful comment. The gen-
tleman is right. When you are right,
you are right.
I would like to comment on some-
thing else that has been in the news,
and that is the longest war in which
the United States has ever been en-
gaged.
For a little history, it took a few
weeks for the United States to find out
where the training and preparation for
9/11 came from, and that the Taliban
and Osama bin Laden were behind it.
They had control of Afghanistan, the
Taliban did.
It was an amazing bit of negotiation
by President Bush, with incredible help
from intelligence and special oper-
ations. The special ops people from our
military were able to negotiate an
agreement with tribal leaders that
ended up being called the Northern Al-
liance. It contained some people who
have become friends, people who love
their country.
By October, we were putting in about
300 special ops military. There is a
great book called ‘‘Horse Soldiers’’
that delves into this issue, and a
movie, ‘‘12 Strong,’’ although the end-
ing wasn’t quite accurate. Our Amer-
ican forces were never to lead an oper-
ation. They were to support Dostum in
his operations, which is what they did,
heroically.
By the end of February 2002, appar-
ently, there was no organized Taliban
left in Afghanistan. It had done an
amazing job. The heroic fighting of
those in the Northern Alliance, the Af-
ghans led by General Dostum, did an
amazing job.
We provided some weapons. We gave
them aerial—well, there were B–52s fly-
ing, but only our special ops guys could
call down bombs.
The leaders could tell the Americans:
Look, there is a bunker. There is a
problem.
They would get the coordinates, call
down the bomb, take care of it. Dostum
and his folks would go in and clean up.
That is how, by the end of October, we
had not lost a single American, and the
Taliban had been defeated.
Unfortunately, at that point, we be-
came occupiers. We sent in lots of
American military, and in the 7-plus
years of Commander in Chief George W.
Bush, we lost just over 600 precious
American military lives in Afghani-
stan.
During the 8 years of Commander in
Chief Obama—I believe, personally, it
was because of the tough rules of en-
gagement, and our people not being
able to defend themselves until it was
sometimes too late—we lost about
three times as many people under Com-
mander in Chief Obama as we did under
Commander in Chief Bush. Whatever
the problem, the buck stops with the
Commander in Chief, and we lost three
times as many when the war was sup-
posed to be virtually over.
What happened, once we became oc-
cupiers, was then more Afghans were
joining the Taliban. I have talked with
an individual who was part of the inner
circle that was being made at the State
Department about what kind of gov-
ernment we would give the Afghans.
That shouldn’t have been our job. We
defeated the Taliban, or the Northern
Alliance did with our help. They should
have been the ones deciding what kind
of government.
The people I have talked to in Af-
ghanistan, friends I have made there,

January 30, 2019
they said: Look, there is not a much
better place on Earth fitted for a fed-
eralist form of government where the
power is in the states or provinces and
in the localities. We don’t need a big
powerful dictator. We need strong
states or provinces.
Yet, the constitution we hoisted onto
the Afghan people, led by a man who is
now in the State Department once
again leading efforts—as I understand
it, he is the guy who said let’s give
them a centrist government.
That is what the constitution gave
Afghanistan. The President of Afghani-
stan appoints the governors. He ap-
points the mayors. He appoints the po-
lice chief.
The people in Afghanistan have said:
Look, this is horrendous. This is a for-
mula for corruption. For heaven’s sake,
at least let us elect our governors,
elect our mayors. Let us choose our
own police chiefs.
b 1530
But that is not the constitution that
we gave them. But there has been an
amendment movement for some time.
The Obama administration would not
support it because they had some of
the same State Department people that
said: No, let’s keep this corrupt cen-
trist—they didn’t say corrupt, but that
is exactly what it gave them. And the
Afghan people don’t like what America
forced on them.
The solution is, encourage them. And
since we spend billions of dollars there,
look, you want another dime? Amend
the constitution; allow an election of
governors and mayors, local selection
of police chiefs. Let’s return the power
to the provinces.
As my friend, former Minister
Massoud, there has said: Look, if you
will help us get that amendment done,
then whenever America leaves, we have
got power back in our local areas. So if
the Taliban takes over one province, or
tries to take over the national govern-
ment, all the other provinces can rise
up and come after them and kick them
out like we did last time.
But as long as we have got this co-
erced, very centralized government, all
they have got to do is knock off a few
people at the top; which is why we have
people that shouldn’t still be in the
State Department who are negotiating
with the Taliban, not even our friends.
Our friends are going to be dead when
we pull out because we are leaving all
this power for easy reach of the
Taliban.
We ought to be negotiating with our
former allies, the ones that defeated
the Taliban within six months, and get
them that amendment, push them to
get that, help them have those first
elections under the amended constitu-
tion, and then get the heck out of Af-
ghanistan.
In that regard, we have a man who is
not here on the floor this week, hasn’t
been in January, named WALTER
JONES. He wanted us out of Afghani-
stan, and he has for a very long time.
He is not going to be around to see that
happen is the indication.
But, Madam Speaker, I know there
are many of us that love that guy, and
I was sad to see him in hospice last Fri-
day. Prayers are with his family, be-
cause WALTER is going to go home and
be better off. But we miss him.
I was heartened to see our friend,
ALCEE HASTINGS here on the floor a
while ago. He has been going through a
difficult bout of pancreatic cancer;
been going through chemo, and I know
my friends on both sides of the aisle
will continue to pray for and encourage
him.
We can have strong disagreements.
We don’t wish anybody to go through
what WALTER and ALCEE have been
going through.
One other friend that I spoke to in
the last week, she has been in my pray-
ers, Anne Graham Lotz. What an in-
credible gift to America Billy Gra-
ham’s children have been. And our
prayers will continue to be for Anne,
ALCEE, and my friend, WALTER, and his
family.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1327
January 30, 2019
Committee, subcommittee, panel, or task
force may vote to close a hearing or meeting
for the sole purpose of discussing whether
testimony or evidence to be received would
endanger the national security, would com-
promise sensitive law enforcement informa-
tion, or would violate any law or rule of the
House of Representatives. If the decision is
to proceed in executive session, the vote
must be by record vote and in open session,
a majority of the Committee, subcommittee,
panel, or task force being present.
(b) Whenever it is asserted by a member of
the Committee, subcommittee, panel, or
task force that the evidence or testimony at
a hearing may tend to defame, degrade, or
incriminate any person, or it is asserted by
a witness that the evidence or testimony
that the witness would give at a hearing may
tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate the
witness, notwithstanding the requirements
of paragraph (a) and the provisions of clause
2(g)(2)(A) of rule XI of the Rules of the House
of Representatives and in accordance with
the provisions of clause 2(g)(2)(B) of rule XI
of the Rules of the House of Representatives,
such evidence or testimony shall be pre-
sented in executive session, if by a majority
vote of those present, there being in attend-
ance no fewer than two members of the Com-
mittee, subcommittee, panel, or task force,
the Committee, subcommittee, panel, or
task force determines that such evidence
may tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate
any person. A majority of those present,
there being in attendance no fewer than two
members of the Committee, subcommittee,
panel, or task force may also vote to close
the hearing or meeting for the sole purpose
of discussing whether evidence or testimony
to be received would tend to defame, de-
grade, or incriminate any person. The Com-
mittee, subcommittee, panel, or task force
shall proceed to receive such testimony in
open session only if the Committee, sub-
committee, panel, or task force, a majority
being present, determines that such evidence
or testimony will not tend to defame, de-
grade, or incriminate any person.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, and
with the approval of the Chairman, each
member of the Committee may designate by
letter to the Chairman, one member of that
member’s personal staff, and an alternate,
which may include fellows, with Top Secret
security clearance to attend hearings of the
Committee, or that member’s sub-
committee(s), panel(s), or task force(s) (ex-
cluding briefings or meetings held under the
provisions of committee rule 9(a)), which
have been closed under the provisions of rule
9(a) above for national security purposes for
the taking of testimony. The attendance of
such a staff member or fellow at such hear-
ings is subject to the approval of the Com-
mittee, subcommittee, panel, or task force
as dictated by national security require-
ments at that time. The attainment of any
required security clearances is the responsi-
bility of individual members of the Com-
mittee.
(d) Pursuant to clause 2(g)(2) of rule XI of
the Rules of the House of Representatives,
no Member, Delegate, or Resident Commis-
sioner may be excluded from
nonparticipatory attendance at any hearing
of the Committee or a subcommittee, unless
the House of Representatives shall by major-
ity vote authorize the Committee or sub-
committee, for purposes of a particular se-
ries of hearings on a particular article of leg-
islation or on a particular subject of inves-
tigation, to close its hearings to Members,
Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner
by the same procedures designated in this
rule for closing hearings to the public.

may vote, by the same procedure, to meet in
executive session for up to five additional
consecutive days of hearings.
RULE 10. QUORUM
(a) For purposes of taking testimony and
receiving evidence, two members shall con-
stitute a quorum.
(b) One-third of the members of the Com-
mittee or subcommittee shall constitute a
quorum for taking any action, with the fol-
lowing exceptions, in which case a majority
of the Committee or subcommittee shall
constitute a quorum:
(1) Reporting a measure or recommenda-
tion;
(2) Closing Committee or subcommittee
meetings and hearings to the public;
(3) Authorizing the issuance of subpoenas;
(4) Authorizing the use of executive session
material; and
(5) Voting to proceed in open session after
voting to close to discuss whether evidence
or testimony to be received would tend to de-
fame, degrade, or incriminate any person.

reported to the House of Representatives un-
less a majority of the Committee is actually
present.
RULE 11. THE FIVE-MINUTE RULE
(a) Subject to rule 15, the time any one
member may address the Committee, sub-
committee, panel, or task force on any meas-
ure or matter under consideration shall not
exceed five minutes and then only when the
member has been recognized by the Chair-
man or subcommittee chairman, as appro-
priate, except that this time limit may be
exceeded by unanimous consent. Any mem-
ber, upon request, shall be recognized for not
more than five minutes to address the Com-
mittee or subcommittee on behalf of an
amendment which the member has offered to
any pending bill or resolution. The five-
minute limitation shall not apply to the
Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member
or the chairman and the ranking minority
member of a subcommittee, panel, or task
force.

ing of the Committee, subcommittee, panel,

ity. Those members arriving subsequently
shall be recognized in order of their arrival.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Chair-
man and the Ranking Minority Member or
the chairman and the ranking minority
member of a subcommittee, panel, or task
force, as appropriate, will take precedence
upon their arrival. In recognizing members
to question witnesses in this fashion, the
Chairman shall take into consideration the
ratio of the majority to minority members
present and shall establish the order of rec-
ognition for questioning in such a manner as
not to disadvantage the members of either
party.
(2) Pursuant to rule 4 and subject to rule
15, a member of the Committee who is not a
member of a subcommittee, panel, or task
force may be recognized by a subcommittee,
panel, or task force chairman in order of
their arrival and after all present sub-
committee, panel, or task force members
have been recognized.
(3) The Chairman of the Committee or the
chairman of a subcommittee, panel, or task
force, with the concurrence of the respective
ranking minority member, may depart with
the regular order for questioning which is
specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
rule provided that such a decision is an-
nounced prior to the hearing or prior to the
opening statements of the witnesses and that
any such departure applies equally to the
majority and the minority.
(c) No person other than a Member, Dele-
gate, or Resident Commissioner of Congress
and committee staff may be seated in or be-
hind the dais area during Committee, sub-
committee, panel, or task force hearings and
meetings.

thorized (subject to subparagraph (b)(1) of

nesses and the production of such books,

pers and documents, including, but not lim-
ited to, those in electronic form, as it con-
siders necessary.
(b)(1) A subpoena may be authorized and
issued by the Committee, or any sub-
committee with the concurrence of the
Chairman and after consultation with the
Ranking Minority Member, under subpara-
graph (a)(2) in the conduct of any investiga-
tion, or series of investigations or activities,
only when authorized by a majority of the
members voting, a majority of the Com-
mittee or subcommittee being present. Au-
thorized subpoenas shall be signed only by
the Chairman, or by any member designated
by the Committee.
(2) Pursuant to clause 2(m) of rule XI of
the Rules of the House of Representatives,
compliance with any subpoena issued by the
Committee or any subcommittee under sub-
paragraph (a)(2) may be enforced only as au-
thorized or directed by the House of Rep-
resentatives.

vance of presentation and shall be distrib-
uted to all members of the Committee, sub-
committee, panel, or task force as soon as
practicable but not less than 24 hours in ad-
vance of presentation. A copy of any such
prepared statement shall also be submitted
to the Committee in electronic form. If a
prepared statement contains national secu-
rity information bearing a classification of
Confidential or higher, the statement shall
be made available in the Committee rooms
to all members of the Committee, sub-
committee, panel, or task force as soon as
practicable but not less than 24 hours in ad-
vance of presentation; however, no such
statement shall be removed from the Com-
mittee offices. The requirement of this rule
may be waived by a majority vote of the
Committee, subcommittee, panel, or task
force, a quorum being present. In cases
where a witness does not submit a statement
by the time required under this rule, the
Chairman, with the concurrence of the
Ranking Minority Member, or the chairman
of a subcommittee, panel, or task force, as
appropriate, with the concurrence of the re-
spective ranking minority member, may
elect to exclude the witness from the hear-
ing.
(b) The Committee and each sub-
committee, panel, or task force shall require
each witness who is to appear before it to file
with the Committee in advance of his or her
appearance a written statement of the pro-
posed testimony and to limit the oral presen-
tation at such appearance to a brief sum-
mary of the submitted written statement.

hearing on that day shall be closed to the
public because disclosure of testimony, evi-
dence, or other matters to be considered
would endanger the national security, or
would compromise sensitive law enforcement
information, or would tend to defame, de-

consideration the ratio of majority members

jority and minority members present and

Let us pray.
Our Father in Heaven, You are our

times You have protected and pre-
served America in the past.
Lord, inspire our lawmakers with
Your presence so that the words of

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY
LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
LANKFORD). The majority leader is rec-

f
S. 1
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, as I
have discussed several times, the
Strengthening America’s Security in
the Middle East Act is a consequential
legislative package that would
strengthen vital partnerships and reaf-
firm our active role in matters of glob-
al concern. I am proud to support it. I
was also proud to lay down an amend-
ment yesterday that would allow the
Senate to speak equally forcefully on
critical subjects in American foreign
policy.
The United States is engaged in
Syria and Afghanistan for one simple
reason: because our enemies are en-
gaged there. Real dangers to us and to
our allies still remain in both of these
nations. So we must continue to con-
front them there. Fortunately, we are
not alone. We are joined in the
counter-ISIS coalition by 78 other part-
ners, and in both Syria and Afghani-
stan, local fighters are bearing the
brunt—the brunt—of the work.
But American leadership is abso-
lutely essential, and that is what this
amendment is all about. My amend-
ment is not partisan. It expresses views
and concerns from Senators on both
sides of the aisle, and it certainly isn’t
political. I intended it as an oppor-
tunity for the Senate to debate and
vote on some of the more consequential
matters of the day, and I expected this
institution to rise to the occasion.
I was a Senator on September 11,
2001. I don’t want America to ever live
through another day like that—none of
us do.
I have also been here in the Senate
for the 17 years since—17 years of
American engagement in worldwide ef-
forts to combat terrorism. It hasn’t
been easy navigating American inter-
ests through this complicated and
troubled region. It hasn’t been easy
adapting to an entirely new way of
warfare against enemies that have
proven adaptive themselves.
It is understandable that as we get
further from September 11, many
would grow tired of our military efforts
a long way from home, but as decisions
from the Obama administration have
made painfully clear, leaving too
abruptly carries its own grave risks.
Had President Obama known that
ISIS would emerge in the wake of his
withdrawal from Iraq and flourish in
the chaos of the Syrian civil war, I sus-
pect he might have done things dif-
ferently. Perhaps he would not have
abandoned Iraq so precipitously, ig-
nored the growing terror threats in
Syria, or allowed Assad to steamroll
over his now-infamous ‘‘red line.’’
We can’t undo this unfortunate his-
tory, but we certainly cannot afford to
repeat it. So it has been a welcome
contrast to see the Trump administra-
tion make huge progress reinvigorating
our fight against al-Qaida in Afghani-
stan and ISIS in Syria. Unshackling
our military has led to progress on the
ground, greater pressure placed on the
terrorists, and new opportunities for
diplomatic and political solutions that
have opened up as a result of the pres-
sure that we have applied.
So what we must remember is how
hard won these gains have been. Our
response to this progress must not be
to take our foot off the gas pedal but
rather to keep up those strategies that
are clearly working.
Our partnership with Iraqi security
forces and the Syrian Democratic
Forces have stripped ISIS of much ter-
ritory in those two nations, but we
have not yet defeated ISIS. We have
not yet defeated al-Qaida in Afghani-
stan. Civil wars continue to rage in
both Syria and Afghanistan. There are
still cauldrons—cauldrons—of sec-
tarianism, extremism, and terror.
President Trump is right that this
cannot be America’s fight alone. The
threats that ISIS and al-Qaida pose are
global. That is why many countries are
with us in this fight. There is more
that those partners can and should do
to keep up direct pressure on terrorists
and on outside actors who interfere
with diplomatic efforts to resolve these
wars.
Putin’s Russia and the ayatollahs in
Tehran need to pay a real price for
their attempts to back butchers—
butchers—like the Assad regime,
Hezbollah, and the Taliban.
We also need to understand that if we
withdraw too soon—too soon—we will

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S756 January 30, 2019
create vacuums in Syria and Afghani-
stan. We know from experience that
Russia and Iran would be only too
happy to fill those vacuums.
If we truly care about containing
Russia, the battleground is not only on
Twitter or Facebook but also in the
world of old fashioned geopolitics.
So my amendment would offer Sen-
ators the ability to speak on all these
subjects. I honestly did not expect this
would be controversial stuff. I didn’t
expect that my colleagues across the
aisle would make a partisan stand and
try to block this straightforward
‘‘sense of the Senate’’ amendment
when it really just restates—restates—
what most of us thought was a broad
bipartisan consensus about American
leadership in the world, but that is
what our Democratic colleagues did.
They tried to block it. Democrats ob-
jected to a vote on this amendment,
apparently because it would expose a
rift among their own membership—a
division between those Senate Demo-
crats who still subscribe to the vision
for America’s leadership and their col-
leagues who have abandoned those
principles at the urging of the very far
left or are too afraid to take either po-
sition—either one. It is quite the split.
It shows how caught up my Democratic
colleagues are in the partisanship of
this moment.
My amendment simply reemphasizes
the expertise and counsel offered by ex-
perts who have served Presidents of
both parties. It is a mainstream
amendment with 19 cosponsors, but ap-
parently a significant portion of to-
day’s Democratic Party isn’t sure—
isn’t sure—they believe in these prin-
ciples any more. They would rather try
to squash the debate and dodge the
vote altogether.
Well, that is not going to work.
These are exactly the kinds of issues
the Senate should be debating. The
Senate has a special role in foreign pol-
icy.
Americans are serving in harm’s way
in Syria and Afghanistan. The Amer-
ican servicemembers, diplomats, and
aid workers in those conflict zones all
deserve to know whether their elected
officials support their efforts or wheth-
er we no longer believe their tireless
efforts serve our national interest.
Our constituents deserve to know
which Senators welcome a thorough
debate over Syria and Afghanistan and
which are simply trying to duck the
debate. Well, despite my Democratic
colleagues’ attempt, I can assure the
American people that they are going to
learn precisely that. I filed cloture on
the amendment yesterday afternoon,
and we will vote on it. Regardless of
whatever political contortions the far
left may be demanding from Senate
Democrats, the American people are
going to learn exactly where their Sen-
ators stand. Our institution will not
shrink from this important duty.
H.R. 1
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on
an entirely different matter, I spoke
for the first time, yesterday, on the
subject that House Democrats have
crowned as their signature effort for
this Congress—H.R. 1, also known as
the ‘‘Democratic Politician Protection
Act.’’ Speaker PELOSI and her col-
leagues are advertising it as a package
of urgent measures to save American
democracy. What it really seems to be
is a package of urgent measures to re-
write the rules of American politics for
the exclusive benefit of the Democratic
Party.
Yesterday, I gave a brief tour
through several of the most bizarre
components of their proposal. Today, I
would like to focus on just one of the
legislation’s major victims—the Amer-
ican taxpayer.
H.R. 1 would victimize every Amer-
ican taxpayer by pouring their money
into expensive new subsidies that don’t
even pass the laugh test. In several new
ways, it would put every taxpayer on
the hook to line the pockets of can-
didates, campaigns, and outside con-
sultants.
Do you look forward to bumper stick-
ers, robocalls, attack ads, and cam-
paign mail that descend on the country
in seemingly endless cycles?
Speaker PELOSI must think you do,
because she wants you to pay for these
things with your tax dollars. You get
the opportunity, with your money, to
pay for attack ads and bumper stickers
and the rest. This bill creates brand-
new government subsidies—govern-
ment subsidies—both for political cam-
paign donors and for the campaigns
themselves.
The Federal Government would start
matching political donations the same
way some employers match gifts to
charity. You would be literally funding
attack ads for the candidates you dis-
agree with. How about that—your
money funding ads for the candidates
you disagree with?
Maybe that is why every Democrat
opposed our tax cuts for middle-class
families and small businesses. They
were counting on that money to pull
off this stimulus package, if you will,
for campaign consultants.
And for what reason? To increase the
competition? Well, studies have shown
that incumbents win just as often in
taxpayer-funded elections as they do
when campaigns are funded with pri-
vate money.
To reduce corruption? Hardly. Juris-
dictions that have toyed with tax-
payer-funded political systems have
turned out to be replete with misappro-
priation, personal use, straw donors,
and public corruption scandals.
So I remain curious why, exactly, the
‘‘Democratic Politician Protection
Act’’ wants to offer the American peo-
ple’s money to thousands of candidates
that run for the House of Representa-
tives every 2 years, whether they sup-
port these candidates or not. They
want citizens to bankroll political ma-
terials that they totally disagree with.
But they aren’t stopping there.
Democrats also want taxpayers on the
hook for generous new benefits for Fed-
eral bureaucrats and government em-
ployees.
Their bill would make election day a
new paid holiday for government work-
ers and create an additional brandnew
paid leave benefit for up to 6 days for
any Federal bureaucrat who decides
they would like to hang out at the
polls during any election. Just what
America needs—another paid holiday
and a bunch of government workers
being paid to go out and work, I as-
sume, for our colleagues on the other
side on their campaigns.
This is the Democrats’ plan to ‘‘re-
store’’ democracy—a brandnew week of
paid vacation for every Federal em-
ployee who would like to hover around
while you cast your ballot? A Wash-
ington-based, taxpayer-subsidized
clearinghouse for political campaign
funding? It is a power grab that is
smelling more and more like exactly
what it is.

STRENGTHENING AMERICA’S SE-
CURITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST
ACT OF 2019—Resumed
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under
the previous order, the Senate will re-
sume consideration of S. 1, which the
clerk will report.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read as follows:
A bill (S. 1) to make improvements to cer-
tain defense and security assistance provi-
sions and to authorize the appropriation of
funds to Israel, to reauthorize the United
States-Jordan Defense Cooperation Act of
2015, and to halt the wholesale slaughter of
the Syrian people, and for other purposes.
Pending:
McConnell amendment No. 65, to express
the sense of the Senate that the United
States faces continuing threats from ter-
rorist groups operating in Syria and Afghan-
istan and that the precipitous withdrawal of
United States forces from either country
could put at risk hard-won gains and United
States national security.

ator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate the fact that the majority leader
has put before the Senate an important
piece of legislation that reemphasizes
our support for our allies in the Middle
East, a very dangerous neighborhood
that has a tendency to have others
drawn into the neighborhood and into
the fight. This legislation is comprised
of four bills that have enjoyed bipar-
tisan support, but we weren’t able to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S757
January 30, 2019
get them done before the deadline at
the end of the 115th Congress.
Each of these four bills speaks di-
rectly to our national security inter-
ests in the Middle East and the support
for our allies, particularly allies like
Jordan and Israel. Every day, the State
of Israel faces attacks from adversaries
in the region, ranging from rocket and
missile attacks to various explosives
and foot soldiers—namely, Hezbollah,
the Iranian-financed and trained effort
to try to exterminate the Jewish State.
Israel is also enduring a different
type of warfare, this time an economic
war known as Boycott, Divestment,
and Sanctions or the BDS movement.
This campaign began in 2005 with more
than 170 Palestinian nongovernmental
organizations lobbying foreign govern-
ments, corporations, and academic in-
stitutions to sever all their ties with
Israel. In the years since, this move-
ment has expanded with participants
seeking to isolate Israel both economi-
cally and politically.
For some, their participation in the
movement is simply a means of voicing
their opposition to Israeli policies in
the Middle East—something that at
least in the United States, they have
every right to do under the First
Amendment. For others, though, it is
part of a strategy to isolate Israel po-
litically and economically, either to
delegitimize the State or to force it to
redraw its map.
State-sponsored BDS is incredibly
harmful. We have seen support for BDS
in capitals across Europe and, sadly,
even in the United Nations, where the
movement has been supported by coun-
tries with questionable humanitarian
records, such as China, Russia, and
Venezuela. A few years ago, the U.N.
Human Rights Council called for the
creation of a so-called blacklist, nam-
ing companies that do business with
Israel. Then, in a report in January,
the U.N. Human Rights Council laid
the groundwork for utilizing those
databases to boycott those businesses,
including at least 22 American compa-
nies.
It is shameful, really, that the U.N.
has chosen to fuel this movement by
encouraging countries to boycott these
businesses for what they claim are ille-
gal activities, even though that argu-
ment has absolutely no bearing on ei-
ther the United States or Israel. This
effort to choke off Israel’s economy by
ending business ties with other coun-
tries could have serious impacts. We
want to make sure State and local gov-
ernments have the flexibility to avoid
business with entities that support the
BDS movement if they wish.
One of the bills included in the legis-
lation we are considering is called the
Combating BDS Act, led by our col-
leagues Senator RUBIO and Senator
MANCHIN.
Before I talk about what the bill
does, I want to talk about what it does
not do. Nothing in this bill restricts
constitutionally protected speech. The
law only impacts commerce-related or
investment-related activities in the
course of interstate or international
commerce. The law does not punish
companies for expressing their opposi-
tion to Israel or its policies or engag-
ing in anti-Israel boycotts, for exam-
ple.
What this legislation does do, how-
ever, is clarify that State and local
governments have every right to
counter boycotts of Israel without fear
that they are somehow violating Fed-
eral law. It assures those local govern-
ments and State governments that if
they decide not to issue contracts or
otherwise do business with entities
that are boycotting or divesting from
Israel, they have every legal right to
do so. This is not a new concept, as 34
States have already enacted legislation
to combat BDS.
In 2017, Texas became the 18th State
to pass legislation preventing tax dol-
lars being used to support the boycott
of Israel. When Governor Abbott signed
that bill into law, he said, at the time,
‘‘Anti-Israel policies are anti-Texas
policies, and we will not tolerate such
actions against an important ally.’’
I agree with his sentiment, certainly,
and I believe it is time to provide all 50
States with the flexibility to make this
decision to forgo any business that
would harm the Jewish State.
It goes without saying, but perhaps
we should reiterate that Israel is an
important and valuable friend and ally
to the United States. It is one of the
main stabilizing influences in the Mid-
dle East, an admittedly dangerous
neighborhood, with aggressors on all
sides wanting to literally wipe the
State of Israel off the map. Of course,
Israel is the only democracy in the
Middle East. Ensuring its viability is
critical to protecting U.S. interests
abroad and here at home, and it is im-
portant that we support our closest
ally in the region.
Passing this legislation is a step to
support Israel in their efforts to pro-
mote democracy in the Middle East. It
takes a strong stance against the anti-
Israel and anti-Semitic BDS movement
and confirms our longstanding support
of Israel. So I look forward to voting
yes on this important legislation when
the time comes, hopefully, very soon.

S. 1
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, the Sen-
ate is currently debating the Strength-
ening America’s Security in the Middle
East Act. These are issues that we need
to deal with, and it is really an impor-
tant time to be talking about these
issues.
Really, there are four different
things that this bill does.
The first thing this bill does is to go
further in providing security for Israel.
I think virtually everybody in the Sen-
ate—there may be an exception or
two—understands that Israel is our
greatest ally in the Middle East, that
Israel is a great source of intelligence
for us as we try to work our way
through problems in the Middle East,
and that we rely on Israel for the part-
nership we have there in the things
that Israel has done to study and test.
Unfortunately, it has gotten to test in
real situations military defense sys-
tems that will intercept things that
are coming at us. As for the whole con-
cept of a bullet that can hit a bullet,
which some people thought was such a
farfetched idea when President Reagan
talked about it in the 1980s, Israel has
proven one can do it with our help with
regard to some of the technology. It is
a partnership. Israel, unfortunately, is
in a place that actually uses it to real-
ly intercept things that are coming at
its citizens, and we found out it works.
Security for Israel is security for the
United States. In 2016, the United
States and Israel signed a 10-year
agreement on security assistance. This
bill makes sure that the agreement
will continue to have the full force of
law. This legislation makes sure that
we are giving some concrete aid to help
Israel protect itself and to protect its
own security.
It also states very clearly that the
policy of the United States is to ensure
that Israel can counter and defeat
threats when it faces its enemies.
These are countries and other groups
that don’t like Israel. It is in their
schools, their propaganda, and their
commitments as nations to talk about
the importance of Israel’s not existing.
In fact, some of them use maps on
which Israel doesn’t exist. If you were
to look at the educational structures of
some of Israel’s neighbors, you would
have to find something outside of what
you learn in school to understand that
there even is an Israel. Of course, there
is Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas. There
are plenty of threats to Israel and to
what Israel and the United States
stand for.
This part of the bill has previously
passed both Houses of the Congress in
slightly different forms. Now it is time
for both Houses to pass it in the same
form, to put it on the President’s desk

so as to further defend and define the
things that are there. This is an impor-
tant thing to do.
The second part of the bill extends
our cooperation between us and Jor-
dan. We have no more faithful partner
outside of Israel than Jordan. Frankly,
that Israeli-Jordan border is critically
important in how that cooperation
works. We saw what happened when
the Syrians looked for a safe place to
go, and they went to Jordan. So we
have done our best to ensure that Jor-
dan can meet its humanitarian crisis
based on what has happened in Syria.
The economic stability of Jordan—be-
lieve me—is critical to the economic
stability of the region. This bill also
comes up with new ways to assist our
allies when they face these unantici-
pated situations, and some of these sit-
uations last for a long time once they
start.
The third part of the legislation im-
poses sanctions on anyone who does
business with the Government of Syria.
The tragedy of Syria—the tragedy of
the Syrian people, the chemical war-
fare of Bashar Assad, the barrel bombs
that have been dropped in neighbor-
hoods where innocent people live, those
being children and senior citizens, and
where people are trying to work every
day—makes it clear that this is not a
country that we should support.
Actually, this portion of the legisla-
tion already passed the House by voice
vote. We need to join the House with
its commitment to continue to put
pressure on Syria for Syria to meet the
standards that civilization should re-
quire of those we deal with. We can’t
deal with Syria as long as it continues
to act in the way it has been acting. It
is something we know needs to be done.
Hopefully, we will have a vote that will
move this further toward reality.
The fourth part of the package we
are talking about is another thing that
we can do in our support for Israel.
There are groups of people who seek to
target Israel through a series of boy-
cotts and disinvestments and sanc-
tions. These are usually not govern-
ments. They are individuals and insti-
tutions that are trying to harm Israel
by boycotting any kind of business
there.
This anti-Israel activity is shameful.
Those who promote it should be penal-
ized. If they want to find out what it is
like to not be able to trade, we should
show them what it is like not to be
able to trade. There are 26 States that
have already passed legislation that al-
lows them to deal in different ways
with people who have either
disinvested in or boycotted Israel. This
bill provides some further definition of
how they can move forward. Boy-
cotting Israel is unacceptable. That is
an important part of this package.
All of these things need to be done,
and this is an important time to send
that message around the world—that
not only our allies inside world can
count on us but that our enemies in the
world—our adversaries—can also ex-
pect us to do what we should do to sup-
port our allies, to defend freedom, to
look forward as one amendment that
has been offered will do that I have co-
sponsored to meet our commitments to
NATO, to understand the continued
dangerous nature of terrorist threats,
to be thoughtful as we make decisions
that move us further away from the
safe havens that those threats have
used in the past. This is an important
time for us to send the very message
that this bill and the proposed amend-
ment do send. I look forward to seeing
that message sent first by the Senate
and then by the House, with then,
hopefully, a signature from the Presi-
dent of the United States.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming.
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, first,
I associate myself with the remarks
that we just heard from the distin-
guished Senator from Missouri, who
made some wonderful points about how
important the bill that we are dis-
cussing on the floor continues to be. I
appreciate his remarks and his leader-
ship in this body.
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. President, I come to the floor to
discuss a different topic, which is that
the government has reopened for 3
weeks. It is welcome news that Presi-
dent Trump has signed the stopgap
funding measure and has fully paid fur-
loughed Federal workers.
There was an important workforce
story that, I believe, was lost over the
last couple of weeks during the shut-
down—the story about the great news
of the American economy. I certainly
feel it at home. I know the Presiding
Officer does in Utah, as do others, as
we head home and see the ‘‘help want-
ed’’ signs that are up and the people
who are looking to hire more people.
This economy continues to fire on all
cylinders. It is fueled, certainly, in
part by what Republicans have been
able to accomplish due to our policy,
which is a pro-job policy of tax cuts
and regulatory relief. Since the tax cut
law that was signed a year ago, this
economy has created 2.6 million Amer-
ican jobs in the last year. There is ad-
ditional good news. I hear it in Wyo-
ming, I heard it last weekend, and I ex-
pect to hear it this weekend. Ameri-
cans are seeing that there is actually
more money in their paychecks. There
is more money for a couple of reasons.
One is that wages are up, and the other
is that taxes are down. Last month,
there was a 3.2-percent year-over-year
increase in average hourly wages. It
matched October as the biggest in-
crease since 2009. This wage increase
was even stronger for production work-
ers and non-managers, who saw an ad-
ditional increase in year-over-year
growth.
The economy is working well. It is
producing more jobs. For 9 straight
months now, there have been more
available jobs in this country than in-
dividuals looking for work. Last week,
we saw jobless claims drop to the low-
est level since November of 1969—1969,
the year we put a man on the Moon and
the year of Woodstock. That was 50
years ago. It was the lowest since then.
That is half a century.
Now that this partial shutdown is
over, I believe we need to refocus our
attention on continuing to grow the
economy, continuing to increase
wages, and continuing to create more
high-paying jobs for American workers.
Meanwhile, Democrats seem to want to
put the brakes on the economy. They
are proposing higher taxes and expan-
sive new regulations.
We still have our work cut out for us.
This excellent economic news under-
scores the need for us to work together
to resolve our differences on important
government funding legislation. Let’s
keep in mind that 70 percent of the
government is already funded all the
way through the end of the fiscal year.
Congress still has the job to do of fund-
ing the remaining 25 percent, and we
need to do that by the middle of Feb-
ruary—by February 15.
By signing the 3-week continuing res-
olution, the President has given Con-
gress the opportunity to come together
to secure the southern border and to
fund the government. During the shut-
down standoff, Democrats repeatedly
called for the President to reopen the
government. They asked for 3 weeks so
they could seriously negotiate, they
say, on border security. Well, we now
have a 3-week agreement, but time is
going to tell whether Democrats are se-
rious about solving this border security
crisis and protecting the American peo-
ple.
A full-year spending deal has to in-
clude significant funding for a com-
prehensive border security package. We
need more personnel, we need more
technology, and we need more physical
barriers.
Security barriers are not the sole so-
lution, but they are an essential part of
the solution. That is why the last four
Presidents built 650 miles of physical
barriers along our 2,000-mile border
with Mexico. Democrats, including
Speaker PELOSI, voted for all this con-
struction. In fact, the Speaker’s home
State of California has a physical bar-
rier on the border with Tijuana, Mex-
ico.
Like his four predecessors, President
Trump has listened to the security ex-
perts. Those four were President
Obama, President Clinton, President
George W. Bush, and President George
Herbert Walker Bush. Four Presidents
prior to President Trump listened to
the experts.
The experts today say we need 200
more miles of physical barriers strate-
gically located where illegal traffic is
surging. Despite the experts’ support,
Democrats have abruptly changed their
position on barriers—changed com-
pletely—and they have denied the
President the funding he has requested.
Given that Democrats had supported
650 miles of the physical barriers we

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S759

currently have, why are they opposing
the next 200 miles, strategically placed
where illegal traffic is surging? To me,
it seems personal, and it seems aimed
at President Trump. The American
people expect us to solve problems not
as Democrats and Republicans but as
elected representatives of the people.
The priority is to move full-year
Homeland Security Department spend-
ing legislation through Congress that
provides wall funding. Today, House-
Senate negotiators are working to
produce a compromise package that
can pass with the other six bills and
get it done by February 15. This con-
ference committee—a committee of the
two Houses—will be meeting later
today. Conferees may also add other
provisions, including immigration re-
forms.
Already, the President has offered to
extend protections for the Dreamers,
who were brought here as children, and
immigrants whose temporary visas are
expiring. So the President has offered
an opportunity and a solution. These
modest proposals are an immigration
policy bandaid. Yet they could be the
start of broader bipartisan immigra-
tion talks. From a policy perspective, I
believe we are not that far apart.
Americans agree that border security
is important and that our immigration
system does need reform. The coun-
try’s safety and security must always
come first.
In my opinion, the President is open
to reasonable changes to his plan. I be-
lieve he has been very willing to com-
promise. As long as Democrats define
victory as blocking President Trump,
however, on his key priority, everyone
loses, and that includes Federal work-
ers, the American people, and immi-
grants.
The American people expect us to
work together to resolve our dif-
ferences. This isn’t a winner-take-all
political game. It never should be.
Members of both parties must be flexi-
ble. Once Congress passes a full-year
spending bill, we can move on to other
priorities facing us as a nation.
President Trump has incredible de-
termination to build physical barriers
where Border Patrol tells us they are
most needed, and the President is right
when he says walls work. Democrats
supported construction before Presi-
dent Trump took office; they should
support it now. The President has pre-
sented a path to compromise. Now
Democrats should follow suit. All we
need to succeed is cooperation. The
best position on this negotiation high-
way is the middle lane. It is time to
move to the middle and move forward
on border security. By working to-
gether, we can produce a winning solu-
tion for America.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

NEY). The clerk will call the roll.

PERDUE). Without objection, it is so or-

ECONOMIC GROWTH
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, Repub-
licans started out the last Congress
with one goal, and that is to make life
better for American families.
After years of economic stagnation
in the Obama administration, too
many families were struggling, wages
were stagnant, and opportunities were
few and far between. Republicans were
determined to change that. We knew
American workers and American busi-
nesses were as driven, creative, and in-
novative as ever. We also knew we were
facing a lot of obstacles, including bur-
densome regulations and an outdated
tax code that acted as a drag on eco-
nomic growth. So we took action.
We eliminated excessive regulations.
We undertook historic reform of our
tax bill to put more money in Ameri-
cans’ pockets and get our economy
going again. The Tax Code may not be
the first thing people think of when
they think about economic growth, but
it is actually one of the key factors
that determine how well our economy
functions. The Tax Code can encourage
growth and job creation or it can make
it difficult for businesses to even oper-
ate, much less grow and create jobs.
Prior to the passage of the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act, our Tax Code was not
helping our economy. Large and small
businesses were weighed down by high
tax rates and growth-killing tax provi-
sions and all the regulatory and com-
pliance burdens that came along with
it. Our outdated international tax rules
left America’s global businesses at a
competitive disadvantage in the global
economy. That had real consequences
for American workers.
A small business owner struggling to
afford the annual tax bill for her busi-
ness was highly unlikely to be able to
hire a new worker or raise wages. A
larger business struggling to stay com-
petitive in the global marketplace,
while paying substantially higher tax
rates than its foreign competitors, too
often had limited funds to expand or
increase investment in the United
States.
In December of 2017, after months of
work, we passed a comprehensive re-
form of our Nation’s Tax Code. We took
action to put more money in American
families’ pockets immediately by cut-
ting tax rates, doubling the child tax
credit, and nearly doubling the stand-
ard deduction. Then we focused on im-
proving the playing field for American
workers by improving the playing field
for businesses. We lowered tax rates
across the board for owners of small-
and medium-sized businesses, farms,
and ranches. We lowered our Nation’s
massive corporate tax rate, which up
until January 1, was the highest cor-
porate tax rate in the developed world.
We expanded business owners’ ability
to recover the cost of investments they
make in their businesses, which frees
up cash they can reinvest in their oper-
ations and in their workers. We
brought the U.S. international tax sys-
tem into the 21st century so American
businesses are not operating at a com-
petitive disadvantage next to their for-
eign counterparts.
Now we are seeing the results. Our
economy is thriving. The economy
grew at a robust 3.4 percent in the
third quarter of 2018. There were 312,000
jobs created in December, and more
than 2.6 million jobs have been created
since tax reform was signed into law.
In 2018, we saw the most impressive job
growth in the manufacturing sector
since 1997, and 2018 also saw 19 States
reach record-low unemployment rates.
This month, initial jobless claims
dropped below 200,000 for the first time
since 1969.
In 2018, for the first time ever, the
number of job openings outnumbered
the number of job seekers. The Depart-
ment of Labor reports that for 9
straight months, there have been more
job openings than people looking for
work. Think about that. There were
more job openings than people looking
for work for 9 straight months. Wage
growth has accelerated, which was
stagnant for so many years in the pre-
vious administration. Wages are now
currently growing at the fastest rate
since 2009. Small businesses had a
record optimism in 2018, and the list
goes on.
In human terms, this means job seek-
ers are finding it easier to find jobs—
and not just any job but jobs they actu-
ally want. Fewer families are having to
choose between repairing the car or
paying for a child’s braces; more indi-
viduals are able to put money away for
their retirement; more families can af-
ford to take that family vacation or to
put money away for their kids’ college.
I am proud the work we have done is
making life better for American fami-
lies. Republicans are going to continue
working to expand operations for
Americans even further, and I hope our
colleagues on the Democratic side of
the aisle will work with us in order to
make that happen.
I yield the floor.

MILITARY READINESS
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise
to address the state of our military
readiness. We live in an uncertain
world, one that is perhaps more unsta-
ble than at any time since the end of
the Cold War.
As Russia increases its belligerence
abroad and China invests millions in a
systemic effort to undermine us, we
find ourselves confronted by strategic
competitors in new and in dangerous
ways.
For decades, violent extremism was
our No. 1 security challenge. While the
threat from global terrorism remains a
priority, the United States and our
ideals are now being challenged by na-
tions seeking to reshape the globe ac-
cording to their own design. This is a
design that does not include the re-
spect for freedom and democracy that

S760 January 30, 2019
we so deeply cherish. We must not
stand idly by and let the rising tide of
totalitarianism and autocracy sweep
away the free global order that Amer-
ica and her allies have fought so hard
to establish and to preserve. As Ameri-
cans, it is up to us to meet these chal-
lenges head-on. That effort begins in
the Senate.
Every Member of this body took an
oath of office to support and defend the
Constitution. There is no greater serv-
ice to that oath and to the people we
represent than to ensure the defense of
the Nation. That is why, in the 116th
Congress, we must build on past efforts
and continue to make the necessary in-
vestments to our military. Doing so
will maintain the safety and security
of our Nation for decades to come.
As a senior member of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, I have be-
come deeply familiar with the warn-
ings that senior leaders at the Depart-
ment of Defense have been delivering
for years. They warn of shortfalls in
munitions, soldiers who are short on
training, pilots without adequate time
in the cockpit, and facilities that are
crumbling from underfunding and ne-
glect. Yet, in politically charged times,
that message sometimes gets muffled
against the backdrop of other debates.
I am concerned that some may not
appreciate how serious the issue of
readiness has become. While we took a
significant step forward with the fund-
ing that was authorized in last year’s
National Defense Authorization Act,
we cannot fix this issue in just a single
year. The depth of the problem is re-
flected in the very metrics that the
services use to measure their ability to
fight.
For my colleagues who may be skep-
tical about the need to make these in-
vestments in our military, I would
point to the following facts.
In the U.S. Army, the world’s most
distinguished ground fighting force,
only 50 percent of brigade combat
teams are fully trained—50 percent.
In the Navy, which protects our Na-
tion against threats around the globe
and defends free commerce on the
world’s oceans, only 30 percent of ship
maintenance has been completed on
time since fiscal year 2012. Because of
this, ships have been unavailable for
training and operations for thousands
of days. This has made the already sig-
nificant workload placed on sailors
even worse, and it has increased its
risk of a catastrophic mishap.
In the Marine Corps—a critical expe-
ditionary force that is essential for 21st
century combat—limitations that have
been imposed by reduced training
hours and a fleet of amphibious ships
that have been cut in half since 1990
have impacted its ability to fight a
major conflict.
In the Air Force, there are 30 percent
fewer airmen and 39 percent fewer air-
craft today than during Desert Storm.
With an average fleet age of 28 years,
our airmen have a tall task of defend-
ing against a range of cutting-edge
threats.
Across all services, the physical in-
frastructure, which comprises every-
thing from soldiers’ barracks to run-
ways, has become badly dilapidated. An
average of one in four military facili-
ties receives a poor or a failing grade.
This is unacceptable not simply be-
cause it means we may not be prepared
to defend ourselves should we need to
fight against a nation that seeks to
harm us but because it is our frontline
soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines
who suffer the consequences when we
do not address readiness. Tragically, it
is our men and women in uniform, who
serve day in and day out—on holidays
and at home and abroad—who are put
at risk if we do not make the collective
decision in this body to support our
military by providing them with the
necessary funding. These are problems
we can fix, but it is going to require us
to work together to find common
ground so as to ensure that America’s
military remains the most capable and
professional force the world has ever
known.
As we debate today in the U.S. Sen-
ate, hundreds of America’s sons and
daughters are standing the watch on
every continent while protecting and
defending our way of life. They are sta-
tioned across oceans, in arid deserts, in
dense jungles, and here at home. No
matter what happens, we know that
they are serving faithfully, each and
every day, to safeguard our liberty and
our freedom.
It is time for us to show them that
they are not alone and that the U.S.
Senate has their backs. Let’s keep
working together so that this year will
be remembered as one in which, despite
our other differences, we will have
agreed on this—that our men and
women in uniform should have the re-
sources they need to fulfill their mis-
sion and that we will continue to pro-
vide for a strong defense of the United
States of America.

GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, as
most people are painfully aware, we
just went through a 35-day government
shutdown. It didn’t work for anybody. I
am here today to talk about a very
simple way to keep these shutdowns
from happening in the future. I am also
here to talk a little bit about how it
fits into the broader discussion we are
having.
What I am not suggesting is that we
somehow leave the border security
issue aside. It is a very important
issue. We have to address it. The Presi-
dent has presented a reasonable plan.
His plan is, actually, to rely on the ex-
perts to determine what kind of bar-
riers ought to be along the border. His
funding of $5.7 billion that he talks
about for these barriers is to fund ex-
actly the top 10 priorities of what the
experts are saying, which are within
the Customs and Border Protection’s
‘‘Border Security Improvement Plan.’’
Along with many other things, I
think that makes sense. A structure
alone—a barrier alone—is not enough.
You have to have cameras. You have to
have ways to see who is coming, and
you have to have ways to respond to it.
You have to have more Border Patrol,
and you have to have more technology.
He also has more drones in his pro-
posal. He has screening at the ports of
entry to be able to stop some of these
drugs from coming into our commu-
nities—the cocaine, the crystal meth,
and the heroin, most of which are com-
ing from Mexico.
I think it is a good plan. I think we
should provide him help on this plan.
We have a true crisis at the border, no
matter how you measure it—whether it
is in terms of the drugs, whether it is
in terms of people coming over, or
whether it is in terms of the human
trafficking that is occurring, according
to the experts. Let’s do it the right
way. Let’s do it through experts. Let’s
not do it because the politicians say it
is the right thing to do; let’s do it be-
cause the experts on the border say it
is the right thing to do. Let’s put the
right kind of barriers in the right kind
of place. That is what I see in the
President’s plan.
He is also talking about working
with Democrats on some immigration
priorities they have had over the years.
For the last 10 years, there have been
Democrats who have talked about
these young people who came here as
children through no fault of their own.
The President has said he would like to
give them more certainty as part of
this plan. Let’s take him up on that.
Why would we miss this opportunity?
It is a good idea. It is the right thing
from a policy perspective. By providing
that kind of help to those DACA recipi-
ents—those young people who are now
working, who are in school, and who
are in our military—I think we can ac-
tually also get some Democrats to be
helpful, to provide more border secu-
rity at the same time we are helping
those who are here and who are deserv-
ing of that help.
The President has also proposed to
help people who come from 10 different
countries around the world stay here
with some certainty for another few
years. These are people who are in the
so-called TPS program, the temporary
protected status program, people from
10 countries where there is war, fam-
ine, and natural disasters, and you
don’t want to send those people back.
They are working on that and working
on getting them work authorizations.
That is what this is about. A lot of em-
ployers here are eager for them to stay
so they can continue to work for some
period of time. So there would be some

January 30, 2019
security for those individuals, tens of
thousands of whom live in States
where there are two Democratic Sen-
ators, States such as Maryland and
Virginia. Those Senators have been
stalwarts and advocates for making
sure there is more certainty for these
individuals. It seems to me we have a
good combination here. Let’s get it
done.
The conferees are talking right now,
but in the meantime, let’s not go back
to a government shutdown. That is not
going to help us get to a solution. In
fact, I would argue that is not only not
leverage on behalf of the President or
any of us, it actually works the other
way because when the government
shuts down, everybody loses.
I am hearing from Senators on both
sides of the aisle who say they are fed
up with these shutdowns. There is now
a building bipartisan consensus that we
need to end government shutdowns. I
am encouraged because I am also hear-
ing from people around the country
about this. There is a bipartisan con-
sensus among individuals about it.
There is an interesting poll out today
that will give you a sense of this. Peo-
ple were given three options. They
were asked: What if these talks break
down? Which one of these three things
should we do: shut down the govern-
ment again; turn to a national emer-
gency, as the President has been talk-
ing about, as a possible option; or not
do either of those first two but, rather,
do the default, which is to have a con-
tinuing resolution and let the spending
from last year continue? Guess what.
Only 9 percent of those polled wanted
another government shutdown. Ninety-
one percent said: No, let’s not go back
there. I call that a consensus. I think it
is time for us to take action here in the
Congress to say: Let’s stop this.
By the way, people feel this way be-
cause they get it. They know that
these shutdowns are a hardship for
Federal employees who are furloughed
or who are forced to go to work with-
out being paid. They are a hardship for
small businesses that can’t get govern-
ment work paid for—work they have
done. They are a hardship for tax-
payers who want good taxpayer serv-
ices, such as having the national parks
open or having food inspections or hav-
ing the IRS hotline open, which we as
taxpayers pay for.
Of course, I heard from a lot of con-
stituents in Ohio during the last 35
days.
I heard from a TSA officer in Cin-
cinnati who, like most people I rep-
resent, lives paycheck to paycheck. He
told me he could not sleep at night.
Why? Because he had never missed a
mortgage payment, and he had to miss
one because he lost two paychecks.
I heard about a butcher shop in
Cleveland, OH. I actually went to visit
it. It is a new butcher shop that just
opened. It has an interesting mission.
It is a deli and a butcher shop in a low-
income neighborhood. They want to
provide fresh, relatively inexpensive
but quality and healthy food for this
neighborhood. It is needed. It is one of
these areas where you hear there is a
food desert. In some areas, particularly
in inner cities, sometimes there is just
not good, healthy food anywhere. Well,
this little butcher shop was excited
about offering it, but guess what. Be-
cause of the shutdown, they couldn’t
get the required Federal permission to
accept food stamps. So they had their
opening, and everything was great, but
they couldn’t complete their mission.
Their mission was to help these people
have better food.
I heard from others as well. I heard
from our Federal prosecutors in Ohio. I
do a lot of work in trying to push back
against the opioid issue, the heroin and
the fentanyl, and the fact that we have
these drug rings in Ohio and elsewhere
that are causing so much harm. These
prosecutors said they couldn’t pursue
these cases. One said: We can’t pay in-
formants during the shutdown. Think
about that. We are slowing down our
prosecution of human trafficking,
opioids, rape, and so many horrible
issues we want to address. We can’t do
it during a shutdown as effectively be-
cause the funds aren’t there to pursue
these investigations.
I heard from Ohio craft beer brew-
eries. These are small businesses in
Ohio. I am told there have been about
65 new ones in the last couple of years
in Ohio. It is a big deal. It is probably
in your State too. These are great busi-
nesses. They have not been able to ex-
pand over the last several weeks during
this 35-day shutdown or to introduce
new products, which is absolutely es-
sential to their revenue stream. They
come out every season with a new
product in order to continue to get
folks to drink these craft beers, but
they need a permit from the Federal
Government to do that, so they
couldn’t introduce their new products.
By the way, I talked to one of them
today. We have been trying to help
them, and they told me they still can’t
get the necessary Federal permits and
licenses to do this. Why? Because the
Federal Government office is so backed
up because of the shutdown. So here we
are almost a week after the shutdown,
but we are really still shut down for
the purposes of these small businesses.
I have heard from the young men and
women of the U.S. Coast Guard. In
Ohio, we have Lake Erie, we have
Coast Guard stations, and we have a lot
of great patriots who have been strug-
gling financially as they worked for no
pay. By the way, they were determined
to do their duty, and I applaud their
patriotism.
I applaud the patriotism of all of the
Federal workers who showed up with-
out getting paid and did their duty and
were proud to do their duty. A lot of
these folks missed two paychecks, but
they didn’t miss a beat, and we appre-
ciate them.
In addition to the impact this shut-
down has had on those Federal employ-
ees and their families, it has also had a
real impact on our economy. We should
pay attention to that.
The Congressional Budget Office just
released a report on Monday esti-
mating the economic impacts the shut-
down had on our economy. Remember,
this was just a partial shutdown. Most
of the funding for defense, as an exam-
ple, we had appropriated, but for 25 per-
cent of it, we had not.
This is what happens: When pay-
checks don’t flow into the economy,
when furloughed Federal workers can’t
perform needed services and are paid
after the fact anyway, and when there
are sudden disruptions for Federal con-
tractors and other businesses that rely
on timely payment from these Agen-
cies, it has a real impact, and tax-
payers are worse off.
CBO estimated that the partial shut-
down reduced GDP by $11 billion in the
near term, $8 billion in the first quar-
ter of this year, and $3 billion in the
fourth quarter of 2018. Fortunately, the
Agency expects an offsetting increase
in economic activity now that the gov-
ernment has reopened and Federal em-
ployees are receiving backpay, but over
the long term, CBO estimates that $3
billion will never be recovered in our
economy. So it has an economic impact
on all of us, and that goes for jobs,
wages, and economic growth.
Some of that economic impact, of
course, also means less revenue. Is it
significant in terms of the overall rev-
enue for our government? Some would
say no, but it is less tax revenue to the
Federal Government.
The aviation industry was hit par-
ticularly hard by the shutdown. The
FAA was subject to the shutdown, and
many of my constituents expressed
concerns about aviation safety. We
heard about the long delays at some of
the airports. That has an economic im-
pact.
I will tell you that airlines, such as
Delta Airlines and Southwest Airlines,
reported that they lost tens of millions
of dollars in revenue in January. So
this is over and above the CBO esti-
mate I was talking about. Delta lost
about $25 million. Southwest lost be-
tween $10 and $15 million. These lost
earnings have decreased Federal tax
revenues, of course, to the government.
CBO didn’t put a price on that, but, in
fact, it is even worse than CBO esti-
mates because of the budgetary im-
pacts that lead to some of these rev-
enue impacts as well.
The bottom line is that the lower
economic growth and the disruptions
for Federal employees ultimately cost
taxpayers more than if Congress had
just passed these appropriations bills
on time and we hadn’t gotten into this
shutdown.
It doesn’t have to be this way. Again,
that is why I am working to ensure we
don’t go there again. In every Congress
for the last five Congresses since I was
elected in 2010, I have introduced legis-
lation called the End Government
Shutdowns Act. I was involved with
this when I was on the House side

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S762 January 30, 2019
under President Bush, and now I am in-
volved with it here because I think
these shutdowns make no sense. I have
introduced it under Republican and
Democratic Presidents. I have intro-
duced it under Republican and Demo-
cratic control of the House and the
Senate. So this is not a political issue
to me; this is a good-government issue.
The bill is a very simple, common-
sense step that would continue funding
from the previous year for any appro-
priations bill that is not done, and
when there is a continuing resolution,
as there is now, whenever that con-
tinuing resolution expires, we would
just continue the funding from the pre-
vious year. Some have called that an
auto CR. Instead of shutting down, at
least the government would continue
to operate.
A CR is not the ultimate answer.
What we really want to do is to get this
place—Congress—to actually do its
work and to pass the individual appro-
priations bills. That is how you reform
government. That is how you ensure
there is certainty and predictability,
particularly at the Department of De-
fense, where they worry a lot about
that.
My bill also says that after the first
120 days—4 months—there will be a 1-
percent across-the-board reduction in
spending to get people to the table so
that appropriators who like to spend
money actually have some incentive to
not just continue the CR. I think that
is important. We would then reduce it
by 1 percent every 90 days thereafter if
Congress doesn’t get its act together
and put these bills together.
I think this will help to not just stop
shutdowns but also to keep us from
having perpetual continuing resolu-
tions. Only through passing these indi-
vidual bills can we do our constitu-
tional duty—and it is our duty.
By the way, some Democrats have
said they are not wowed by the 1 per-
cent across the board after 4 months.
They have said that somehow Repub-
licans would like that better than they
would. I just don’t agree with that. I
will tell you, 53 percent of the spending
in this category is defense spending. It
is not security spending, which is more
than that, but 53 percent of it—more
than half—is defense spending. It is Re-
publicans on this side of the aisle who
talk about this every year, and we have
accomplished increasing defense spend-
ing. We are not going to want to cut
defense spending.
By the same token, some on the
other side will feel strongly about their
priorities, and some of us have other
priorities as well. We all have prior-
ities. This is not meant to be an un-
even balance; it is meant to be fair—1
percent across the board for every-
thing.
My hope is that we can pass this leg-
islation. We now have 28 cosponsors in
the Senate. More than half of the Re-
publicans are on this bill. We have the
opportunity to actually move this for-
ward, I hope, in this current negotia-
tion over the border I talked about and
over the immigration policies I talked
about. Let’s do it.
On the other side of the Capitol, my
friend TROY BALDERSON, a Republican
Representative from Ohio, and a Demo-
crat, JEFF VAN DREW from New Jersey,
have introduced this bill. They intro-
duced it last week, so now we have a
companion bill that is bipartisan in the
House as well.
You have heard Speaker PELOSI say
she is against shutdowns. You have
heard CHUCK SCHUMER, who is the lead-
er over here for the Democrats, say he
is against shutdowns. You have heard a
lot of our leadership say they are
against shutdowns. Well, this might be
something we can actually get to-
gether on and do something about.
My hope is that we can move for-
ward. We hope we can put a common-
sense bill in place that doesn’t allow us
to fall back into another one of these
painful government shutdowns. They
are not good for anybody.
Let’s forge a bipartisan agreement on
this funding. We are not that far apart,
as I said earlier. Let’s be sure we have
border security. Let’s deal with some
of these lingering immigration issues
where the President has extended the
olive branch. Let’s do something good
for the people we represent, but at the
same time, let’s find a will to include
in this package legislation that ends
these government shutdowns while
what happened these last several weeks
is still fresh in our minds. Having gone
through this bitter experience of the
longest shutdown in history, let’s be
sure we don’t let people down. Instead,
let’s make sure we do not let this mo-
ment pass and indeed stop these gov-
ernment shutdowns once and for all.
I yield back my time.

ator from Louisiana.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—AMENDMENT
NO. 65
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as you
know, today, or very shortly, the Sen-
ate is going to be taking up S. 1, called
the Strengthen America’s Security in
the Middle East Act.
Through the Chair, I would say, S. 1
is being offered by Senator MARCO
RUBIO, the senior Senator from Flor-
ida. He is, as we also know, whip smart,
and Senator RUBIO has forgotten more
about foreign policy than I will ever
know. I have enormous respect for him,
and nothing I say today is meant to
criticize his extraordinary efforts on
this bill, much of which I have sup-
ported and will continue to support,
but there is a deficiency in S. 1. We can
do better by filling that hole.
Once again, Congress is paying lip
service to protecting our allies in the
Middle East. We are calling this bill a
protector of our allies in the Middle
East, and in large part it is, with a
major exception—because, once again,
the U.S. Senate is leaving behind our
friends and allies, the Kurds.
It is not the first time the Kurds
have been left behind. The Kurds were
left behind when the Ottoman Empire
collapsed, and they remained a state-
less people. The Kurds were left behind
as modern states grew up around them,
in Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Turkey, where
they had no political representation,
where the Kurds had no future besides
oppression. The Kurds were left behind
again in 2011, when allied troops pulled
out of Iraq, and ISIS was just begin-
ning to emerge. It is time we break
that pattern, once and for all, and the
Senate can do it in Senator RUBIO’s
stellar effort in the form of S. 1.
As I said, S. 1 does some really good
things. I thank Senator RUBIO. It will
reaffirm our commitment to protecting
Israel, certainly our closest friend in
the region, maybe our best friend in
the world. Sometimes I think Israel is
our only friend in the world. S. 1 will
strengthen our bond with Jordan, an-
other key ally in fighting terrorism
and the humanitarian catastrophe
caused by the Syrian refugee crisis. It
will combat a radical economic warfare
campaign against Israel. Let me say
that again because it is important. S. 1
will combat a radical economic warfare
campaign against Israel. I support that
unconditionally. S. 1 will create new
sanctions on the Government of Syria
that targets those who have been laun-
dering money to help the Assad regime.
I support all of those things, but with
all the respect I can muster, I say,
gently, it is a lie. It is a lie for anyone
to say that S. 1 protects all of our al-
lies in the Middle East because it will
not. S. 1 makes no mention of our
Kurdish allies at all. I have an amend-
ment pending—I have offered an
amendment, rather, that would fix
that.
There are 30 million Kurds in the
Middle East. They don’t have a state,
they don’t have a country to call their
own. They are not really safe any-
where. As a result, the Kurdish people
have suffered tremendously throughout
history. They have been subjected to
discrimination, massacres, forced relo-
cation, and countless other human
rights violations.
Saddam Hussein attacked more than
4,000—4,000 Kurdish villages—not peo-
ple, Kurdish villages—with poison gas
and other chemical weapons during the
Iran-Iraq war. One hundred eighty
thousand people died. They were mur-
dered. Many more were tortured. Even
more were imprisoned. Thousands fled,
not that they had anywhere to go.
In the 1990s, Turkish soldiers made a
hobby out of burning down Kurdish vil-
lages. Since 1984, more than 40,000
Turkish Kurds have been killed. They
still face oppression today in nearly
every country they inhabit. The Turk-
ish Defense Minister made that clear in
December, when he said that when the
time comes, the Kurds ‘‘will be buried
in the ditches they dug. No one should
doubt this.’’ That is a quote.
Through all this incomprehensible
suffering, the Kurds have stood by
America, and we have stood by them
through the decades, through thick and

through thin. The Kurds have been in-
strumental at every phase of U.S. en-
gagement in Iraq and Syria, every
phase.
Going back to the 2003 invasion,
Kurdish fighters have been crucial
boots on the ground in the fight
against Islamic tyranny, and that is
just a fact. The parts of Iraq retaken
and controlled by the Kurds were
strongholds for Western values like de-
mocracy and capitalism and
multiculturalism. In fact, when allied
forces withdrew in 2011, not a single
U.S. soldier had lost his or her life in
Kurdish territory.
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic
Forces, better known as the SDF, have
been another set of boots on the ground
in the fight against ISIS. With the help
of coalition supplies, weapons, and air-
strikes, the SDF recaptured large parts
of Northern and Eastern Syria from
ISIS’s iron grip.
Four years ago, the Presiding Officer
will recall, there were 100,000 ISIS sol-
diers. Thanks in large part to our
Kurdish allies, those numbers today
are 5,000. Today, ISIS has surrendered
99 percent of its territory, including its
capital in Raqqa. The so-called caliph-
ate fighters are now being held to a
small sliver of territory on the eastern
border with Iraq near the Euphrates
River. Our Kurdish allies deserve much
of the credit for these successes.
It is plain to see that the Syrian
Kurds have been invaluable in Amer-
ica’s fight against jihadists and tyrants
in the Middle East. The SDF, Syrian
Kurds, controls nearly one-quarter of
Syria right now. That is land that
doesn’t belong to ISIS; that is land
that doesn’t belong to Assad, a butch-
er; that is land that doesn’t belong to
Russia; and that is land that doesn’t
belong to Iran. More importantly, it is
land where the Syrian Kurds know
they will be free from persecution and
from slaughter.
For a while now, I have been asking
my colleagues in the Senate to support
my amendment to S. 1. My amendment
would promote stability and security
for our close friends in the Middle East
because it is the right thing to do. It is
the moral thing to do, and America’s
foreign policy has always had a moral
component.
My amendment will allow the United
States to defend the Kurds in Syria by
giving the President—not requiring the
President to do anything. It would give
the President the authority to use our
military as he deems fit to keep our
promise and to protect our allies—and
all of our allies. After all, the Kurds
have contributed to the fight against
ISIS, and we owe them some peace of
mind as we draw down our presence in
the region. As we draw down our pres-
ence in the region, it is time to stand
up and stand by our friends to make
sure the fight stays won.
The threat of U.S. military force has
been a major deterrent for the reemer-
gence of jihadists like ISIS and al-
Qaida. As the Presiding Officer knows
well, weakness invites in wolves. Our
presence has held back Assad, it has
held back Turkey, it has held back
Russia, and it has held back Iran from
gaining stronger footholds in the area.
Without assurances of our support, as
we wind down our effort in Syria, the
Kurds will be left behind to fend for
themselves. Without the Kurds, we
cannot be certain who will step in to
fill the power vacuum in the areas of
Syria they currently control. We can
only guess, and the answers to those
guesses don’t look good.
If the Kurds are vulnerable to attack
from Turkey or Syrian rebels, they
might have to turn to their enemies for
protection out of fear. Even if they
don’t, they can’t fight off the Turkish
military if the Turkish military de-
cides to attack and pursue the rem-
nants of ISIS at the same time.
To abandon the Kurds now would be
unconscionable. To abandon the Kurds
now would compromise the security of
our allies, Israel and Jordan, and it
would risk exposing the region to more
turmoil.
I urge my colleagues in the Senate to
think about the Kurds as they consider
how best we can strengthen America’s
interests and security in the Middle
East. It is time we make sure America
keeps the promises we made to all of
our allies—not just some of our allies,
all of our allies—in the Middle East.
Mr. KENNEDY. Toward that end, I
hereby offer a second amendment that
I am sending to the desk. This second-
degree amendment will amend amend-
ment No. 65 proposed by Senator
MCCONNELL. I ask that the amendment
be read.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OF-
FICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE
COUNSEL
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this
year marks the 100th anniversary of
the establishment of the Legislative
Drafting Service, which we now know
as the Office of the Legislative Coun-
sel. In recognition of the anniversary, I
would like to make a few comments
about the history of the office.
During the first 130 years of Con-
gress, 1789–1918, legislation for Con-
gress was drafted by Members of Con-
gress, congressional staff, Executive
agencies, and outside individuals and
groups which sometimes led to legisla-
tion that was not always clear, con-
sistent, organized, and well written.
In 1911, Columbia University estab-
lished a Legislative Drafting Research
Fund to conduct research and work to-
ward the better drafting of statutes
and sent Professor Middleton Beaman
and Thomas Parkinson to Congress to
demonstrate the feasibility and value
of the use by Congress of a full-time
staff of professional legislative draft-
ers.
The positive experiences of commit-
tees, Members, and staff of Congress,
including the Ways and Means Com-
mittee of the House of Representatives,
in working with professional legisla-
tive drafters led to the introduction
and consideration of legislation to es-
tablish a Legislative Drafting Bureau,
including S. 1240, 63rd Congress, which
was reported to the Senate on June 17,
1913.
During the debate on the establish-
ment of a Legislative Drafting Bureau,
Senator Elihu Root of New York ar-
gued in favor of establishment citing
the use of counsel by the British House
of Commons and stating that ‘‘[t]he
fundamental idea . . . to give the ben-
efit of a trained, experienced student in
the preparation of bills. . . . We need
trained and intelligent assistance in
the drafting of laws.’’
On February 24, 1919, Congress en-

S764 January 30, 2019
of 1918, 2 U.S.C. 271 et seq., which estab-
lished the Legislative Drafting Service.
The House of Representatives and the
Senate were initially served by a single
office with two branches that received
a single appropriation that was equally
divided and transferred employees be-
tween the branches to meet special
needs.
The two individuals who carried out
the demonstration by the Legislative
Drafting Research Fund became the
first Legislative Counsels of the Legis-
lative Drafting Service with Middleton
Beaman appointed in February 1919 as
the first Legislative Counsel of the
House of Representatives branch of the
Service and Thomas Parkinson ap-
pointed in March 1919 as the first Leg-
islative Counsel of the Senate branch
of the Service.
In 1924, the name of the office was
changed from the Legislative Drafting
Service to the Office of the Legislative
Counsel.
The House of Representatives and the
Senate branches of the Office of the
Legislative Counsel began to evolve
separately during the 1930s when the
Senate branch, while continuing to
meet the drafting needs of Senate com-
mittees, began to devote a significant
part of the resources of the Office to
the drafting requests of individual Sen-
ators while the House branch contin-
ued to limit the services of the branch
to committees of the House.
The House of Representatives and the
Senate branches of the Office contin-
ued to separate in 1958 when, for the
first time, the two branches received
separate and not equal appropriations
and were officially separated in 1970
when a separate charter was estab-
lished for the Office of the Legislative
Counsel of the House by title V of the
Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970,
2 U.S.C. 281 et seq.
The first attorneys joined the Office
to work only for a session or on a par-
ticular project and then moved on to
other positions, with Thomas Parkin-
son, the first Legislative Counsel of the
Senate, and John E. Walker, the suc-
cessor of Parkinson, each serving fewer
than 2 years and Frederic P. Lee, the
third Legislative Counsel of the Sen-
ate, being the first to serve a substan-
tial term of about 8 years.
The career tradition of the Office of
the Legislative Counsel of the Senate
was established with successors to
Frederic P. Lee who served the Senate
in the Office for their careers or long
periods of employment, including
Charles Boots—1922–1961, 32 years;
Henry Wood—1926–1943, 17 years; Ste-
phen Rice—1933–1950, 17 years; John
Simms—1936–1966, 30 years; Dwight
Pinion—1942–1969, 27 years; John
Herberg—1947–1971, 24 years; Harry
Littell—1947–1980, 33 years; Douglas
Hester—1952–1990, 38 years; Francis
Burk—1970–1998, 28 years; James
Fransen—1975–2014, 39 years; Gary En-
dicott—1981–2018, 38 years; and Bill
Baird—2010–present, 33 years, who
served as attorneys of the Office and
Legislative Counsels of the Senate.
During the 100-year history of the Of-
fice, the Office of the Legislative Coun-
sel of the Senate has served the Senate
well by providing a steady, reliable
source of nonpartisan and nonpolitical
professionally drafted legislation for
committees, Members, and staff.
The attorneys and staff members of
the Office have established and main-
tained traditions of professionalism
and dedication that have helped to pro-
vide to the Senate a sense of con-
tinuity and institutional memory.
There has been a dramatic growth in
the use of the Office by the Senate
where, during the 66th and 67th Con-
gresses—1919–1923—704 requests were
drafted by three attorneys for an aver-
age of 117 drafts per attorney for both
Congresses, to the most recently ended
115th Congress—2017–2018—where 72,106
requests were drafted by 37 attorneys
for an average of 1,948 drafts per attor-
ney for that Congress.
To deal with its increasing workload,
in 1990, the Office established teams
with multiple attorneys per team that
were responsible for drafting legisla-
tion under the jurisdiction of one or
more Senate committees which has
provided the Office with the flexibility
and resources to respond to and meet
the growing demands placed on the Of-
fice for ever-changing areas and com-
plexity of active legislation.
Attorneys in the Office and the
House Legislative Counsel’s Office use
a uniform drafting style to improve the
quality and consistency of Federal leg-
islation and Federal law, including
whenever practicable plain English,
brevity, consistent organization and
terms, and captions and subdivisions to
organize drafts and make the drafts
more readable and improve the admin-
istration and interpretation of and
compliance with laws enacted by Con-
gress.
After the anthrax attacks on the
Senate in October 2001, the Office of
the Legislative Counsel of the Senate
continued to draft legislation for the
Senate by working in temporary facili-
ties outside the Office while the Dirk-
sen Senate Office Building was decon-
taminated for 1 month and has since
developed an effective long-term capa-
bility to deal with emergencies, re-
flecting the can-do attitude of the Of-
fice.
The role of the Office in the legisla-
tive work of the Senate is not often ac-
knowledged, but it is understood and
appreciated by all Senators.
The 262 current and former employ-
ees of the Office have worked very hard
over its first 100 years to provide con-
sistently a high quantity of high-qual-
ity legislation for the committees,
Members, and staff of the Senate.
As the Office of the Legislative Coun-
sel of the Senate celebrates its 100th
anniversary, the Office is well prepared
to continue to provide the Senate and
its committees and officers quality
drafting service and sound legal advice
with the spirit of quiet professionalism
that has been the tradition of the Of-
fice throughout its history.
I know that all Senators join me in
congratulating the Office of the Legis-
lative Counsel of the Senate on the
100th anniversary of the founding of
the Office.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that a listing of the men and
women of the current staff of the Office
of the Legislative Counsel be printed in
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
Legislative Counsel—William R. Baird;
Deputy Legislative Counsel—Elizabeth Al-
dridge King; Senior Counsels—Charles E.

CENTENNIAL OF BEAUMONT INN
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, in
Kentucky’s oldest town sits a beautiful
and historic building on the top of a
hill. Beaumont Inn, with its name
taken from the French for ‘‘beautiful
mount,’’ is my State’s oldest Southern
country inn. The Harrodsburg estab-
lishment is a beacon of hospitality
with a distinguished history, and I
would like to take a moment to mark
the centennial anniversary of this
treasured Kentucky landmark.
When the main building of today’s
Beaumont Inn was constructed around
1845, no one could have perceived the
incredible future in store, but then
again, the location had already had a
notable history. An original wooden
structure on the site was believed to be
the childhood home of John Marshall
Harlan, future Kentucky attorney gen-
eral and Associate Justice of the U.S.
Supreme Court.
For many years afterward, the site
served as a series of schools for women,
including the Greenville Institute, the
Daughters College, and finally as Beau-
mont College until 1916. The next year,
the grounds were purchased by an
alumna of the Daughters College,
Annie Bell Goddard, and her husband
Glave. In 1919, the Goddards opened the
new 31-room Beaumont Inn, and the
same family has proudly operated this
wonderful Kentucky establishment
ever since.
Throughout the next century, Glave
and Annie Bell’s descendants have wel-
comed countless guests to the inn, pre-
serving this historic building, its pic-
turesque scenery, and the tradition of

Southern hospitality. Beaumont Inn
grew, both in physical size and in pres-
tige, even earning inclusion onto the
National Register of Historic Places.
Some of the new buildings include the
Greystone House, Bell Cottage, and
Goddard Hall, which honors Beau-
mont’s founder. Not only is the inn a
charming destination, but it is also a
museum filled with interesting arti-
facts of Kentucky and American his-
tory. Today, the inn is operated by the
fourth and fifth generation of the God-
dard family, Chuck and Helen Dedman
and their son, Dixon.
It is beyond question that quality
cuisine is a vital aspect of all Southern
hospitality. As a pinnacle of a tradi-
tional Bluegrass experience, Beaumont
Inn sets a high bar. Visitors are drawn
to its main dining room by the famous
‘‘yellow-legged’’ fried chicken and 2-
year-old Kentucky-cured country ham.
The inn’s cornmeal batter cakes are a
breakfast favorite. In recognition of its
culinary excellence, Beaumont Inn has
earned some of the highest accolades in
this field, including the America’s
Class Award from the James Beard
Foundation. Visitors can also enjoy a
Kentucky bourbon at the Owl’s Nest
lounge or at the Old Owl Tavern,
named one of the best bourbon bars in
America. As Kentucky leads the Na-
tion in a bourbon revival, the inn has
also become an official stop of the Ken-
tucky Bourbon Trail. These amenities
reaffirm the strong bonds between this
historic institution and one of the
Commonwealth’s signature industries.
In fact, the New York Times published
an article about the storied history of
Kentucky Owl Bourbon, recently re-
vived by the Dedman family.
I look forward to my next visit to
Beaumont Inn, and I would like to
thank the Dedman family for their
tireless efforts to preserve this Ken-
tucky treasure. Their stewardship of
this historic site and long-term vision
helps connect our Commonwealth’s
past to its bright future. As Beaumont
Inn celebrates 100 years of excellence, I
would like to extend my best wishes to
the Dedmans, the staff, and all who
enjoy this beloved institution.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION
Japan—AEGIS Weapon System
The Government of Japan has requested to
buy two (2) AEGIS Weapon Systems (AWS),
two (2) Multi-Mission Signal Processors
(MMSP) and two (2) Command and Control
Processor (C2P) Refreshes. Also included is
radio navigation equipment, naval ordnance,

services, installation support material,
training, construction services for six (6)
vertical launch system launcher module en-
closures, communications equipment and as-
sociated spares, classified and unclassified
publications and software, and other related
elements of logistical and program support.
The total estimated program cost is $2.150
billion.
This proposed sale will contribute to the
foreign policy and national security of the
United States by improving the security of a
major ally that is a force for political sta-
bility and economic progress in the Asia-Pa-
cific region. It is vital to U.S. national inter-
ests to assist Japan in developing and main-
taining a strong and effective self-defense ca-
pability.
This proposed sale will provide the Govern-
ment of Japan with an enhanced capability
against increasingly sophisticated ballistic
missile threats and create an expanded, lay-
ered defense of its homeland. Japan, which
already has the AEGIS in its inventory, will
have no difficulty absorbing this system into
its armed forces.
The proposed sale of this equipment and
support does not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.
The prime contractor for the Aegis Weapon
System and Multi-Mission Signal Processors
will be Lockheed Martin Rotary and Mission
Systems, Washington, DC. The Command
and Control Processor Refresh will be pro-
vided by General Dynamics, Falls Church,
VA.
There are no known offset agreements pro-
posed in connection with this potential sale.
Implementation of this proposed sale will
require annual trips to Japan involving U.S.
Government and contractor representatives
for technical reviews, support, and oversight
for approximately eight years.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.

TRIBUTE TO ROBERT CARDILLO
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I take
this opportunity to honor the work and
career of Mr. Robert Cardillo. On Feb-
ruary 7, 2019, Robert Cardillo will con-
clude nearly 36 years of service with
the U.S. intelligence community, end-
ing as Director of the National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, or
NGA.
In 1983, Robert began his career at
the Defense Intelligence Agency, or
DIA, as an imagery analyst. He served
in a multitude of positions for DIA and
NGA, to include Acting Director of In-
telligence for the Joint Staff, in which
he supported the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, which is the first time
a civilian has ever held that position.
He was then selected by the Director of
National Intelligence, the DNI, to be
the first ever Deputy Director for In-
telligence Integration. In that capac-
ity, he was responsible for vastly im-
proving intelligence integration, the
principal mission of the DNI as estab-
lished under the Intelligence Reform
and Terrorism Prevention Act. As a
critical additional duty, Robert also
served as the primary briefer for the
President’s daily brief at the White
House.
From 2014 to 2019, Mr. Cardillo then
led NGA as its Director. Under his
guidance and direction, NGA provided
much lauded geospatial intelligence
support to U.S. and allied combat oper-
ations in Southwest Asia and around
the globe, assisting in the fight against
militant extremists. NGA also con-
veyed key indications and warning dur-
ing crises in Northeast Asia, the Mid-
dle East, North and Central Africa,
Eastern Europe, and elsewhere.
Highlighting the need to get unclas-
sified data to the warfighter and our
allies, Director Cardillo pushed hard
for unclassified geospatial intelligence,
or GEOINT, to exist in the open. He
urged NGA to work in tandem with
commercial satellite imagery providers
and other unclassified industry part-
ners. His support of innovation in arti-
ficial intelligence, automation and
augmentation, and his focus on activ-
ity-based intelligence set NGA on a
course to improve the speed and qual-
ity of geospatial and imagery analysis.
His attention to the ebola crisis in
West Africa and other humanitarian
assistance and disaster response initia-
tives showed the value of human geog-
raphy to the world.
Director Cardillo was equally suc-
cessful at forging new multinational
partnerships in Europe and Asia, and
his outreach to industry, academia,
think tanks, and other international
partners led to an informal but increas-
ingly thriving global GEOINT enter-
prise.
Mr. Cardillo was also the first NGA
director to emphasize the importance
of the Arctic and Antarctica and the
first to take on the security, quality,
and pedigree of imagery pixels and
data, so that the GEOINT enterprise
can continue to serve as a safe
foundational frame of reference for the
entire intelligence community.
Robert led NGA with integrity for
more than 4 highly challenging and de-
manding years, to include the selection
of a future headquarters site in St.
Louis, MO. He laid the groundwork for
a world-class building that will be de-
signed to endure well into the 22nd cen-
tury and to serve as the modern work-
place that his workforce so richly de-
serves.
Director Cardillo will long be remem-
bered as a relentless visionary who re-
structured the future of his field to em-
brace public and private partnerships,
data science, and machine learning. His
far-sighted vision will continue to
drive requirements and ensure that
NGA shows the way to a safer United
States and a more secure world.
We thank him for his years of service
to the intelligence community and to
this country.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
REMEMBERING ROGER DAVID
MARSH
∑ Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask the
Senate to join me today to support the
posthumous promotion of U.S. Marine
Corps SSgt Roger David Marsh to gun-
nery sergeant. Today I would like to
recognize the distinguished service of
Mr. Marsh, who passed away at the age
of 72 on June 17th, 2008.
Mr. Marsh served honorably in the
U.S. Marine Corps for 20 years with a
superior record, including combat ac-
tions against enemy forces throughout
his career in both Korea and Vietnam.
Throughout his time in the Marine
Corps, he received numerous awards
and citations to include the bronze star
with valor. Additionally, he made sig-
nificant contributions to his commu-
nity after his retirement from the Ma-
rine Corps by actively participating in
the Veterans of Foreign Wars and
American Legion, as well as his 30
years of exceptional service as chief of
policy for Webb City, MO.
Prior to Staff Sergeant Marsh’s re-
tirement from the Marine Corps, he
was selected for promotion to gunnery
sergeant. He worked diligently for 8
years to get that promotion. Due to
personal reasons, he chose to leave the
Marine Corps prior to the 2-year obli-
gation of service and therefore was not
promoted. Forty-five years after his re-
tirement, we can finally honor his serv-
ice and legacy through a posthumous
promotion.
The State of Missouri and our Nation
were very lucky to have such a dedi-
cated member to the community. Mr.
Marsh’s extraordinary service to the
Marine Corps and time after his retire-
ment were remarkable. His actions rise
to the level of service that warrants
this unique honor. Therefore, I ask my
colleagues to join me in honoring
Roger David Marsh’s life and legacy
with the distinction of gunnery ser-
geant.∑

order according to the finalists’ names.

A problem that is growing rapidly in our
world would be the increase in children en-
tering foster care due to the opioid crisis.
The White House stated that ‘‘in 2016, more
than two million Americans had an addic-
tion to prescription or illicit opioids.’’ This
shows that there is a huge climb in the
amount of people getting addicted. Emily
Birnbaum and Maya Lora, writing for The
Hill, reported that ‘‘the population of chil-
dren in foster care had risen by 15 percent to
30 percent in just the last four years.’’ This
shows that due to opioid crisis, the foster
care system is filling up, and they don’t have
enough homes for the children.
The first solution that could help would be
to get more funding for the state to use on
children and treatments. There has been
funding given due to President Trump taking
office; ‘‘more than $1 billion in funding has
been allocated or spent directly addressing
the drug addiction and opioid crisis’’ (The
White House). A couple ways the funding
could be used for would be for hiring more
social workers. A lot of the children don’t
get the attention they need because there
are so many cases of children for one person
to do.
The second solution would be to make get-
ting treatment easier, not only getting more

treatment homes but also making them
more affordable. It could go from anywhere
from $650 to $250 a day (American Addiction
Centers). That’s a lot of money for someone
who is struggling with an addition and could
be almost impossible to get. With the fund-
ing they can invest ‘‘in residential substance
treatment program[s] that keeps families to-
gether while a parent gets help’’ (The Hill).
By doing this the treatment center is giving
the parents an incentive to get better and
follow through with the treatment.
The third solution that could help would
be keeping the families together. In the
paragraph above The Hill mentioned a center
where addicts can get help but still be with
their families. One thing that would be good
about keeping family together is ‘‘once [they
finish their] treatment and are stable, [they]
can reintegrate [the people] into [their] old
work and apartment and things that will
keep [them] clean and not create unsafe cir-
cumstances for [their] children to be taken
away’’(The Hill). This treatment center
could potentially decrease the number of
children entering foster care by a lot.
All of the above solutions could help drop
the number of children in foster care. This is
an important issue because many American
children and adults are being affected by this
problem. I know from experience that it
hurts to be a child who watches their parents
rely on drugs, and then one day some random
person comes and takes the child away.
There needs to be a change, and it must hap-
pen fast. If it doesn’t I’m afraid that many
children and adults will be stuck in a solu-
tion that could kill them all.

Abraham Lincoln reminded us that ‘‘a
house divided against itself cannot stand.’’
Today, America feels almost as divided as it
was before the Civil War. Partisan news
channels and a primary system that favors
playing to the base have produced election
cycles lacking in civility and meaningful dis-
cussion. However, the erosion of respectful
political discourse and the increased polar-
ization of the electorate are not entirely the
fault of politicians nor the voters who elect
them. They are instead inevitable con-
sequences of the First Past the Post (FPTP)
voting system we use to elect our represent-
atives.
First Past the Post (or plurality voting) is
a voting system where each voter has one
vote and the candidate with the most votes
wins. While this system is intuitive and sim-
ple, it is fatally flawed. Because plurality
voting has only one winner, and one vote per
person, it is impossible for elections to have
more than two viable candidates. Any addi-
tional strong candidates will result in the
winner earning less than half of the vote. To
illustrate my point, imagine a scenario in
which there are three candidates: a center-
right candidate, a center-left candidate, and
a more liberal candidate. If half of the voters
are right-leaning and half are left-leaning,
the two left-leaning candidates will inevi-
tably split the liberal vote and lead to an
easy conservative victory, whether or not
more people would have preferred either one
of the two left-leaning options. Therefore, to
avoid the negative effects of splitting the
vote, voters must vote strategically by vot-
ing against the candidate they most prefer
to avoid electing the candidate they most
dislike. Because voters must vote strategi-
cally, elections in FPTP systems produce
two major parties defined by their opposition
to each other. Campaigns become increas-
ingly negative as the parties compete in a
‘‘race to the bottom’’ to vilify the other par-
ty’s candidate instead of promoting their
own positive ideas. This is exacerbated by a
primary process that favors the most uncom-
promising candidates.
Attempts to address the problems with
FPTP voting are being made. For example,
Maine recently transitioned to Ranked
Choice Voting, a system where voters can
rank their favorite candidates rather than
choosing only one option. This improves po-
litical discourse and favors moderation be-
cause politicians must compete for second
place votes as well as first choice votes.
Ranked Choice Voting eliminates the incen-
tive for politicians to run negative cam-
paigns. It doesn’t make sense to dismiss the
opposition if you want their voters to sup-
port you.
Consequently, campaigns under a Ranked
Choice system tend to be more civil, with
less polarized electorates. When politicians
spend all of their time playing to their base,
they have no incentive to compromise with
the other side, weakening democracy. Be-
cause Ranked Choice Voting encourages civil
discussion, politicians are more likely to
work with each other on issues that are im-
portant to the American people. American
democracy is broken. We should fix it by
changing how we elect our civil servants.

The greatest problem our country faces is
not just a national problem, but a problem
that affects the entire world—climate
change. Climate change will impact all of
the people of the world regardless of race,
gender, or social class. If our country does
not address this problem, the world will be
destroyed. In October, the Intergovern-
mental Panel on Climate Change released a
report warning that unless humanity dras-
tically reduces CO2 emissions, the change to
the world’s climate will become irreversible.
Arctic sea ice will disappear. Sea levels will
rise to the point where coastal cities will be-
come completely submerged. Extreme
weather will become more frequent. Potable
water and food will become more scarce. Yet
many people in the United States still deny
that climate change exists, or they believe
that there is nothing they can do to change
the outcome. This ignorance and sense of
powerlessness is dangerous at this critical
point in time because the solution to climate
change requires the people of the world to
come together and act as one.
Under the Trump administration, the
United States has stopped participating in
the global effort to stop climate change. Mr.
Trump has stated that the United States will
withdraw from the Paris Agreement as soon
as possible. This is a rash decision consid-
ering the consequences of ignoring climate
change. Instead of running away from re-
ality, the United States should accept the re-
sponsibility of being a global power and rise
to the challenge of saving the world from cli-
mate change.
To solve the problem of climate change, it
will take a large scale effort. Similar to the
American war effort during the Second
World War, every American will need to get
behind the movement to stop climate
change, and it is the government’s responsi-
bility to lead the people in this struggle. The
government needs to issue stricter regula-
tions on the emissions produced by large
businesses. Instead of spending an enormous
amount of money on the military, the gov-
ernment needs to invest money for scientific
research to stop climate change. The govern-
ment must offer incentives for people to live
sustainably or impose a gas tax to reduce
emissions. The United States needs to work
with other nations to share ideas and solu-
tions. Jobs can also be created from the
work that will be required to clean the envi-
ronment, on the federal, state, and local
level. The public education system has al-
ready started educating people about cli-
mate change and its dangers. Hopefully, this
education will help change the culture so
that the American people actively want to
address climate change.
In the past, America has proven that it can
unify as a nation and tackle global problems.
It is simply a matter of Americans seeing
the dangers of climate change and realizing
that it must be our top priority. We must
lead the rest of the world and become a role
model for the world. We need to engage the
government so that we change ourselves in-
stead of the climate.

Xenophobia is one of America’s greatest
debacles. Defined as the fear of foreigners,
xenophobia has unnecessarily increased over
the past few years due to numerous factors.
America was founded by immigrants, yet we
now prosecute those flocking here in search
of better lives.
American immigration has always fluc-
tuated due to the extent of xenophobia in the
country at the time. During World War II
numerous Jewish refugees flocked to Amer-
ica seeking safety from the Nazis. Among
these people was Albert Einstein, now seen
as one of America’s greatest minds. We have
seen this occurring recently with the immi-
gration ban on Syrian immigrants. In the
modern day, war torn Syrian asylum seekers
are denied entrance to America and are left
living in overcrowded refugee camps in Leb-
anon and Jordan. America’s policy: keep
them out, they may be terrorists.
Immigrants living inside U.S. borders are
being denied the right to naturalize. Chil-
dren of illegal immigrants who used to be
protected under Deferred Action for Child-
hood Arrivals (DACA) are now unsure of
their safety after DACA was suspended by
President Trump. These harmless people
whose parents wanted a better life for their
children are denied citizenship due to xeno-
phobia. The act of separating families or de-
porting innocent children to countries where
they are unfamiliar with the language and
culture is unjust.
My family lived in Saudi Arabia for six
years. Living internationally taught me to
be open-minded towards everyone; I attended
an international school with students from
over 100 nations. Every student was like me,
and deserved the same rights. When I re-
turned to the America I was alienated by
classmates who posed ridiculously ignorant
questions such as ‘‘Are you Muslim?’’ ‘‘Are
you going to bomb the school?’’
The issue at hand is fear. Americans need
to open their eyes and educate themselves
about the world, not just their country. Only
36% of all Americans have passports, and or-
ganizations such as the U.S. Peace Corps,
which encourage world connections are
struggling to find volunteers. We must elimi-
nate our fear is through education. By edu-
cating citizens about the outside world,
whether it be by inviting more refugees into
our country, sending more Americans abroad
to do service work, or having immigrants
talk about their experiences, we will be able
to reduce hatred and fear. We don’t need a
wall, we need to tear down our own walls of
ignorance and hatred.
Without immigrants, America would not
be the extraordinary country it is today.
Through history, we have looked down on
immigrants, and have created ‘‘nativist’’
groups who yearned to exclude immigrants
from their society. Everyone deserves the
rights that all Americans have; many do not
have the access to such rights in their home
countries. By excluding those willing to be-
come citizens, we not only deny them oppor-
tunities in this country, but we deny them of

Where do you imagine the human race
being in 20 years? 50 years? The effects of cli-
mate change should be front and center in
our minds when fantasizing about a space
age world. The human desire for technology
and cheap cost of living negates responsi-
bility to the environment. Climate change
means more than a rise of a few seemingly
insignificant degrees over centuries of
human innovation and industrialization;
however, the rising oceans and temperatures,
animal extinction, and increased natural dis-
asters are the real world effects that cost us
an increasing amount of money, resources,
and even human lives to sweep under the
rug.
One of the main effects of climate change
is the rise of ocean height and temperature.
According to NASA, a federally funded orga-
nization, the sea level will rise 1–4 feet by
the year 2100. This is in addition to the eight
inch rise in sea levels since 1880. A rise of 1–
4 feet in sea levels is comparable to the shal-
low end of a swimming pool, but in the real
world means millions of homes and busi-
nesses destroyed on the vulnerable coastline,
which cannot be restored as we do with hur-
ricanes and tornadoes. Climate change by
itself may not seem to be a huge issue, but
the ripple effect it creates causes colossal
damage.
When solving these problems, we cannot
think of our own lives, but rather future gen-
erations. Humans do not have the power to
predict the future, but we can shape the fu-
ture. There are two parts to the solution of
climate change: Mitigation and Adaptation.
Adaptation is adjusting to the effects of cli-
mate change. This plan does not deal with
the issue of slowing and preventing climate
change, but with preventing the effects of
global warming from changing the way peo-
ple live, even if it does change where they
live. Mitigation is reducing the amount of
greenhouse gases that are released into the
atmosphere. For mitigation to be a viable so-
lution to solve the earth’s warming, we need
a global plan for a global problem. This
means that, as a global community, we need
laws to promote and enforce renewable en-
ergy (solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal),
sustainable houses and buildings, eliminate
litter, cut down on trash, cut down on re-
source use, the list goes on. This intensive
process requires a change in mindset, and
support and participation from all people in
all nations.
Let the U.S. stand where the world knows
it to be, one step ahead of others, and carry
all nations to the solution of global warm-
ing. We know the mass destruction that
global warming can cause, and the best solu-
tion to counter it. So now let the question
we ask not be what we imagine the world to
be in 20 years, but what is necessary to get
there.

The world today revolves around our de-
pendency on convenience. We live in a soci-
ety that works to make our lives easier
through inventions like drive-thrus and one-
use items. Ignoring the effects of this de-
pendency has resulted in an environmental
crisis that seems to be too great to fix. The
fact that 18 million pounds of plastic enters
our oceans annually should shock our gen-
eration and instill a sense of ownership
about this issue (Howard). Realizing that
plastic dominates most of our consumerism
and convenience needs should prioritized re-
ducing its production. The way to treat this
issue would be by placing a ban on unneces-
sary plastic goods and an emphasis on teach-
ing students about our oceans and environ-
ment instead of ignoring the problem.
By banning plastic accommodations like
straw, bags, and bottles, over 14 billion tons
of plastic waste could be prevented (Howard).
The United States would be joining other na-
tions like the United Kingdom and India in
an effort to reduce plastic waste. The Euro-
pean Commission proposed, ‘‘a ban on 10
common items that it says make up about 70
percent of the litter in EU waters. This in-
cludes plastic straws, drink stirrers, plates,
and more’’ (Howard). All these items seem to
make life easier but they have become the
reason for the world’s struggles with plastic
pollution.
When we share the knowledge about how
harmful plastic has become, then we take re-
sponsibility about choosing a plastic water
bottle because it’s easy. I only learned about
the dire state of our oceans a few years ago
when I walked on the beaches in Santa Bar-
bara and saw plastic Starbucks cups and
straws intertwined with the seaweed that
had washed up onto shore. From that mo-
ment I realized that plastic does not go any-
where but into landfills and if we keep pro-
ducing more and more, none of our beaches
will have no plastic debris. If schools took
action and speak about plastic waste, there
would be no excuse for our ignorance regard-
ing the planet’s environmental state.
Taking plastic pollution seriously, starting
by a national ban on straws, bags, and water
bottles, would be the first step in the right
direction. We cannot undo the past, but the
future lies in the decisions we start making
today. Plastic, a man-made product, cannot
keep killing thousands of sea creatures with-
out our government trying to enforce some
kind of change. If the United States does not
understand its dire need for plastic reduc-
tion, our future generations will never know
the ocean with plastic filling them.
PAIGE DEAN, SOUTH BURLINGTON HIGH

Members of Congress, I come before you
today to speak about something that is near
to my heart. I spend my summers sailing on
beautiful Lake Champlain in my home state
of Vermont, and every Fourth of July my
family and I kayak out into Burlington Bay
and watch the fireworks. The lake is part of
many Vermonters’ lives; from childhood
jokes about Champ, our local lake monster,
to walks along the shore and trips across on
the ferry, our Lake Champlain has been an
integral part of the Vermont experience.
But today, Lake Champlain is suffering,
just as the rest of America is. Devastating
hurricanes in the South are displacing us
and flooding our homes and businesses.
Droughts and wildfires in the West raze the
ground, destroy our property, prevent our
crops from growing and force us to flee. Our
shining seas are encroaching on our plentiful
shores, the water lapping ever closer, year by
year, to our front stoop. Summers are get-
ting hotter, and storms wilder. We all know
the cause, and what it means for us. Climate
change is real. We are experiencing it right
here, right now. Science does not lie, and all
around our nation we are seeing it firsthand.
The homeowners in Louisiana who can’t sell
because their house is in a flood zone, the
farmers in Arizona whose crops are with-
ering from drought, the schoolchildren in
Flint, Michigan, whose tap water is unsafe to
drink, and those Vermont who can’t utilize
their lake due to dangerous algae blooms.
Every single thing I have listed has its
roots in our own actions. However we twist
it, the facts remain: we are responsible for
climate change.
There is still hope. If we act now, we can
lessen the effects of climate change on our
homes and livelihoods. I call now on Con-
gress to pass and support strong and direct
legislation to help our environment and
economy. Strengthen the EPA! Ensure that
this vital agency has the resources and lead-
ership necessary to protect our lands and
create real change. Pass legislation tight-
ening regulations, taxing and limiting the
production and spread of pollutants, give in-
centives to alternative clean and sustainable
energy companies, move to limit our reli-
ance on oil and gas, and make America en-
ergy independent and sustainable. We have
thousands of capable scientists, business
leaders, policy experts and engaged citizens
ready to work on solutions and save our
planet. Let them! Work with our allies and
neighbors to mitigate climate change world-
wide. Rejoin and support the Paris Climate
Agreement! Climate change affects our
whole planet, and only global solutions and
partnership will solve it. Let’s work on fos-
tering the clean energy and environmental
protection programs of other countries
through incentives and aid, especially to de-
veloping countries while promoting energy
independence.
Solutions are in our grasp, we only have to
believe in them, reach out, and grab them.
Otherwise, we are doing ourselves, the people
of America, and indeed the whole world a
great disservice. The world’s future, Amer-
ica’s future, our future is at stake. Act now.

FIGHTING FOR WOMEN’S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS
In America, woman are still continually
fighting for women’s reproductive rights 70
years after Roe vs. Wade was passed. While
many people agree that women have a right
to their own body, many politicians still en-
gage in an unrelenting and increasingly ag-
gressive attacks on women’s reproductive
health care. They do this by introducing and
passing unconstitutional bills that would re-
strict women’s rights, for example by stifling
access to essential health care and endan-
gering women’s lives. To put this into per-
spective, this, that means hundreds of wom-
en’s rights are being taken away with each
restriction passed, according to the National
Reproductive Rights Organization. A pos-
sible solution is the Women’s Health Protec-
tion Act which would prevent states from
passing these dangerous legislations and
would prohibit state and federal politicians
from imposing a range of dangerous anti-
choice provisions that take away women’s
rights and choice over their own body.
In his first year in office, Trump and his
administration have brought an aggressive
campaign against women’s sexual and repro-
ductive rights to the White House, by lim-
iting women’s access to birth control and his
anti-abortion advocacy. To understand the
administration’s emphasis on rolling back
birth control access and abortion rights, it’s
important to remember the administration
is filled with people who have a track record
of anti-abortion legislation and advocacy
throughout the years such as Vice President
Mike Pence and Trump’s top healthcare ad-
visor Katy Talento. Trump administration’s
2018–’22 draft plan for Health and Human
Services, for the first time ever suggested
the federal health agency will now be ‘‘serv-
ing and protecting Americans at every stage
of life, beginning at conception.’’ this lan-
guage about conception and unborn children
signals a shift toward faith-based decision-
making in American health care. But wom-
en’s rights are not based on the faith or be-
liefs of the government officials but rather
each woman’s individual choice, therefore
the decision should be up the person whose

body is being affected and not a single
groups beliefs.
The Women’s Health Protection Act would
prevent states from passing these dangerous
legislations and would prohibit state and fed-
eral politicians from imposing a range of
dangerous anti-choice provisions. Senator
Sanders needs to expand and protect the re-
productive rights of women by continuing to
fight and support for The Women’s Health
Protection Act, and by bringing attention to
this continuing struggle for equality and in-
dividual choice over one’s own body. Senator
Sanders also can fight to keep Planned Par-
enthood funded and covered by Medicaid, as
attacking Planned Parenthood remains a
priority for social conservatives in our Con-
gress today. As of right now 2.5 million peo-
ple rely on Planned Parenthood for a range
of health care services, like birth control and
cancer screenings, and defunding it would
change the health of millions of Americans
as found in the article ‘‘How Women’s repro-
ductive rights stalled under Trump’’ by Julia
Belluz. So therefore I am not only asking for
continuing support for women’s reproductive
rights but also the health of millions of
Americans.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mr. ROBERTS (for himself,
Mr. MORAN, Mr. BLUNT, and
Mrs. FISCHER):
S. 273. A bill to amend the Commu-
nications Act of 1934 to require pro-
viders of a covered service to provide
location information concerning the
telecommunications device of a user of
such service to an investigative or law
enforcement officer or an employee or
other agent of a public safety answer-
ing point in an emergency situation in-
volving risk of death or serious phys-
ical harm or in order to respond to the
user’s call for emergency services; to
the Committee on Commerce, Science,
and Transportation.
Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise
today to speak about an important
piece of legislation I just filed, aptly
named after the young Kansan whose
life and bright future was cut short by
a senseless act of violence and whose
case now is the inspiration for why we
desperately need to update the law.
Almost 12 years ago, on June 2, 2017,
18-year-old Kelsey Smith was abducted
in broad daylight from an Overland
Park, KS, parking lot. Kelsey’s abduc-
tion was captured on the store’s closed-
circuit security camera, which left lit-
tle doubt about the emergency sense of
the situation. This was an emergency.
Here is the tragedy. Four days after
Kelsey disappeared, authorities were
able to locate her body after a wireless
provider finally released the call infor-
mation from her cell phone—4 critical
days. Providing location information
as fast as possible is absolutely critical
to ensure that law enforcement offi-
cials can rescue victims in imminent
danger of death or serious physical
harm and hopefully prevent future
fates similar to Kelsey’s.
This legislation is the culmination of
years of work among legislators at
both the Federal and State levels, in-
cluding industry stakeholders, privacy
advocates, and, most importantly,
Kelsey’s brave parents, who spear-
headed this initiative and have advo-
cated to create commonsense reforms
that properly balance the needs of law
enforcement with Fourth Amendment
protections for all of our citizens.
Through their advocacy and tireless
efforts, Missey and Greg Smith have
helped enact laws, oftentimes with
unanimous support, in 23 States, in-
cluding my home State of Kansas. This
law provides law enforcement with the
necessary tools to rescue individuals in
emergency situations where the threat
of death or serious bodily injury is im-
minent.
The impact of this law at the State
level has been real and measurable. For
example, in May 2012, one month after
the enactment of its State’s version of
the Kelsey Smith Act, local authorities
in Tennessee were successful in saving
the life of a child who had been ab-
ducted by a suspected child rapist. Be-
cause the child was believed to be in
imminent danger, the police were able
to successfully receive the location of
the suspect’s cell phone in a window of
time that led to the safe recovery of
the child alive and before she was as-
saulted.
In February of 2015, Kelsey’s Law
helped save the life of a 5-month-old
Lenexa, KS, girl when a car with a
baby in the back seat was stolen from
its mother. Through Kelsey’s Law, po-
lice were able to ping that mother’s
phone, which was left in the car, and,
within an hour, the baby was reunited
with her parents.
According to the National Center for
Missing and Exploited Children, the
first 3 hours are critical to recovering
a child alive. That is why it is nec-
essary that in these narrowly defined,
isolated instances in which a person’s
very life is at stake, an exemption
should be made to allow wireless car-
riers to immediately ping an individ-
ual’s phone and release to law enforce-
ment the whereabouts of that indi-
vidual.
Understanding this, my legislation
would provide law enforcement with
the ability to recover the location of
children, other missing individuals,
and only in very specific emergency
situations; namely, where there is risk
of death or serious bodily injury.
Don’t just take it from PAT ROBERTS.
Public safety professionals with experi-
ence in the field support this lifesaving
legislation. According to the retired
Johnson County sheriff, Frank
Denning:
Time is of the essence in these types of in-
cidents and the narrow exception for law en-
forcement to act with immediacy is key
here. For this not to be a Federal law seems
unjust to those who have loved ones in
harm’s way and this type of intervention can
and will save lives.
Major Scott Boden with the Johnson
County Sheriff’s Office in Kansas says:
Over my 22-year law enforcement career
with the Johnson County Sheriff’s Office, 17
years have been spent in our dispatch/911
center. During that time, the Kelsey Smith
Law has been the single most important
piece of legislation related to potentially
saving the lives of suicidal subjects, assist-
ing endangered children, and addressing live
threats when cell phone location is necessary
and seconds count. The difference this law
has made cannot be overstated and I look
forward to the day it becomes available all
across this country as a resource to assist
first responders in their most critical service
saving lives.
Jennifer Lanter, the 9–1-1 director for
Loudon County, TN, says:
In Tennessee, we have had the privilege of
having Kelsey’s Law enacted for several
years. There are multiple examples of how
utilizing this law has resulted in lives being
saved that otherwise would have been lost.
This law enables the men and women that
have dedicated their lives to the protection
of others to ensure they are able to do every-
thing possible to locate someone that needs
help. The benefits of this law being passed at
the Federal level will be far-reaching, and
countless lives will be saved.
It is not just these individual law en-
forcement officials who support this
bill. The bill is also supported by the
National District Attorneys Associa-
tion, the Federal Law Enforcement Of-
ficers Association, the Sergeants Be-
nevolent Association, the International
Association of Chiefs of Police, the
Major County Sheriffs of America, the
National Association of Police Organi-
zations, the Fraternal Order of Police,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S771
January 30, 2019
and the National Sheriffs’ Association.
I don’t know of any law enforcement
organization that has been left out,
and if it has been left out, it would cer-
tainly support the bill. CTIA, the wire-
less association, also supports this
commonsense legislation.
Just this morning, I received a letter
of support from John Walsh, who is the
cofounder of the National Center for
Missing and Exploited Children and
was the well-known host of the tele-
vision show, ‘‘America’s Most Want-
ed.’’ Mr. Walsh has dedicated his life to
advocating for victims’ rights. It began
with his fight for the passage of the
Missing Children’s Assistance Act fol-
lowing the abduction and subsequent
murder of his son Adam.
Fortunately, for my colleagues, vot-
ing for this bill will not take a blind
leap of faith. Kelsey’s Law is already
saving lives in States like Kansas, New
Jersey, Nebraska, Minnesota, New
Hampshire, North Dakota, Tennessee,
Hawaii, Missouri, Utah, West Virginia,
Colorado, Nevada, Rhode Island, Or-
egon, Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Iowa,
Washington, Louisiana, Delaware, Indi-
ana, and Alabama. Yes, I wanted to re-
peat all 23.
Oftentimes, the approval by State
legislatures has been unanimous, and
that is because Kelsey’s Law strikes
the appropriate balance between ensur-
ing that law enforcement has the tools
it needs to help individuals who are in
grave danger and ensuring that the
proper checks are in place to guard
against government overreach.
My legislation requires all law en-
forcement agencies to maintain a
record of all requests made under the
Kelsey Smith Act. This record will in-
clude the name of the officer who is re-
questing location information from a
wireless carrier, a description of the re-
quest that explains the need for the
disclosure of location information, and
a declaration that an individual’s loca-
tion information is needed in order to
offer him life assistance during an
emergency situation that, again, in-
volves a risk of death or serious phys-
ical harm.
I stress that nothing—absolutely
nothing—in the Kelsey Smith Act pro-
hibits wireless carriers from con-
tinuing to operate the robust law en-
forcement verification systems that
they use today in order to make abso-
lutely certain that when a request is
made, it is coming from an authorized
law enforcement official.
Kelsey was never given the oppor-
tunity to attend college or to get mar-
ried or to have children and experience
the American dream that many of us
take for granted every day. Yet what
she did do was to inspire her mother
and her father to make it their mission
in life to help educate and empower
communities and children in order to
help prevent another case like this
from ever happening again.
Kelsey’s father, Greg, who is a former
law enforcement officer himself and a
Kansas State senator, said it best when
he quoted President Abraham Lincoln
to describe what Kelsey had accom-
plished:
In the end, it is not the years in your life
that count. It is the life in your years.
I thank my colleagues for the oppor-
tunity to speak on the floor today and
to offer what, I think, is a common-
sense bill that will help prevent trage-
dies like Kelsey’s. I also thank Senator
MORAN, Senator FISCHER, and Senator
BLUNT for their strong support and co-
sponsoring of this bill. I welcome the
President’s support as well.
I ask every colleague in this body to
consider one question: If it were your
children, your grandchildren, your
spouses, would you not want law en-
forcement to have immediate access to
information that could potentially
save their lives and bring them home?
Let’s honor Kelsey’s memory by
passing this legislation in Congress. I
see no reason why it could not pass by
unanimous consent.
I thank the Presiding Officer.
By Mr. KAINE:
S. 281. A bill to provide for a period of
continuing appropriations in the event
of a lapse in appropriations under the
normal appropriations process, and to
prohibit consideration of other matters
in the Senate if appropriations are not
enacted; to the Committee on Appro-
priations.
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today I
introduced the End Shutdowns Act.
Enacting this bill would go a long way
towards avoiding the pain and suffering
caused to families from government
shutdowns, such as the recent 35 day
partial shutdown.
I have been outspoken against Presi-
dent Trump’s use of a government
shutdown as a negotiating tactic, and—
in an effort to take away that option in
the future—this bill would initiate an
automatic continuing resolution on Oc-
tober 1 if no appropriations bill is
passed by that date. The legislation
would then stop the Senate from mov-
ing forward with any other legislation,
outside of an emergency scenario, until
Congress reached an agreement on a
long-term spending deal.
I am advocating for my colleagues to
consider supporting this bill, especially
those negotiating on the current spend-
ing bills set to expire February 15, to
include legislation to prevent future
shutdowns in any bipartisan deal
reached by that deadline.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION
HON. RON KIND
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I was unable to
have my votes recorded on the House floor on
Monday, January 28, 2019 due to flight can-
cellations from heavy snow in Wisconsin. Had
I been present, I would have supported the
passage of all bills considered on the floor. In
particular, I strongly supported the passage of
H.R. 502, the FIND Trafficking Act, as this bill
is an important step forward in preventing on-
line marketplaces used for sex trafficking or il-
legal drug trafficking.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF GAR-
DEN GROVE FIRE CHIEF TOM
SCHULTZ
HON. HARLEY ROUDA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to celebrate the life of Tom Schultz, Fire Chief
of Garden Grove, CA. This past weekend, Mr.
Schultz died of stage 4 pancreatic cancer.
Chief Schultz devoted his life to ensuring
the safety and security of all Orange County
residents, spending three decades in the fire
departments of Garden Grove, Fullerton, and
Brea, CA.
In addition to his day-to-day work at the fire
station, Chief Schultz trained and mentored
young firefighters through his work as an in-
structor in Santa Ana College’s fire technology
program, and he was deeply involved in the
management and leadership of the Orange
County Fire Chiefs’ Association.
I commend Chief Schultz for his years of
service and extend my heartfelt condolences
to his family and friends in this difficult time.
I ask all members to join me in remem-
bering Tom Schultz—a public servant, family
man, and leader—for a lifetime of service to
the people and communities of Orange Coun-
ty.

HONORING RANDY RANDAZZO
HON. JIMMY PANETTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Mr. Randy Randazzo for his service
to the community of Carmel Valley, California.
Mr. Randazzo has made a career out of serv-
ice and has fostered an environment of
collectiveness and compassion in his tight-knit
community.
As a World War II Marine Veteran, Mr.
Randazzo heroically served in the Bougainville
Campaign in the Solomon Islands. He served
on the fleet that facilitated the Japanese sur-
render, signaling the close of World War II.
Upon returning to his home of Carmel Valley,
Mr. Randazzo dedicated his life to his commu-
nity. He and his wife, Charlene, have owned
and operated the local market in Carmel Val-
ley Village, which has served as the corner-
stone for the community. Randy is also active
in the local Kiwanis Club, where he works to
empower youth to change the world by invest-
ing in their futures.
Among his many achievements, Mr.
Randazzo has been awarded Carmel Valley’s
Good Egg award for Citizen of the Year twice
for his service to the community. Additionally,
he has been recognized by the Carmel Histor-
ical Society for his contributions in organizing
and establishing the Carmel Valley Community
Center. Many called Mr. Randazzo the unoffi-
cial mayor of Carmel Valley, as the small, un-
incorporated community views his leadership
as invaluable and irreplaceable.
I am immensely grateful for Randy
Randazzo’s distinguished service to his coun-
try and the residents of the central coast of
California. Madam Speaker, I ask that my col-
leagues join me in congratulating Mr. Randy
Randazzo on his distinguished career and rec-
ognizing his outstanding citizenship and im-
mense contributions to both Carmel Valley
and the United States of America.

HONORING JAMES BELT AT CON-
GRESSMAN VELA’S BLACK HIS-
TORY MONTH CELEBRATION
HON. FILEMON VELA
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the legacy of James Belt, a native of
Harlingen, for his work and service in the
great State of Texas.
Mr. Belt earned his Bachelor of Business
Administration from the Pan American Univer-
sity, Edinburg, in 1968, and his Juris Doc-
torate from Thurgood Marshall School of Law
at Texas Southern University (TSU) in 1977.
After law school, he opened his law practice in
South Dallas, where he served the African
American community for almost 40 years. A
lifetime member of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People, Mr. Belt
was also a member of the National Bar Asso-
ciation, the Texas Bar Association, J.L. Turner
Legal Association, and the American Inns of
Court.
As founder of the Dallas Black Criminal Bar
Association, he was a well-respected leader
and advocate for the advancement of his com-
munity, and inspired others to help those in
need. He served on the TSU Board of Re-
gents, the Dallas Area Rapid Transit Board,
and the Texas Rural Foundation Board. He
was the co-publisher of the Dallas Examiner.
Mr. Belt received the ‘‘Living Legends’’ award
from the J.L. Turner Legal Association, and
was recognized as ‘‘Business Man of the
Year’’ by the alumnae chapter of TSU in 2010.
I am pleased to honor James Belt for his
legacy of unselfishness and generosity. Mr.
Belt’s devotion to serving others makes him
an outstanding role model for the people of
the Lower Rio Grande Valley. I ask my col-
leagues to join me in honoring James Belt,
and recognizing his surviving family and
friends on this special occasion.

WILDLIFE CONSERVATION AND
ANTI-TRAFFICKING ACT
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I
reintroduce the Wildlife Conservation and Anti-
Trafficking Act with Congressman DON YOUNG
(R–AK), the Dean of the House.
I thank Congressman YOUNG (R–AK) for his
support as my co-lead and original cosponsor
on this important legislation, as well as our
former colleague Congresswoman Madeleine
Z. Bordallo (D–GU), who sponsored this legis-
lation in the previous Congress.
Around the world, poachers, traffickers, and
transnational criminal organizations respon-
sible for human rights abuses are driving
iconic wildlife to extinction. The Wildlife Con-
servation and Anti-Trafficking Act advances
American leadership in tackling this global cri-
sis. Our bipartisan bill would strengthen fed-
eral enforcement against the global trade in il-
legal wildlife and seafood products, while also
providing dedicated funding for conservation
efforts, at no expense to taxpayers.
Specifically, our bill would make serious
wildlife trafficking violations predicate offenses
under federal racketeering and anti-organized
crime laws (RICO and Travel Acts). The bill
would also engage whistleblowers, through
monetary incentives, in providing actionable
intelligence needed to bring down global wild-
life trafficking rings. Under our bill, the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service would be authorized
to station law enforcement officials and agen-
cy personnel abroad in high-intensity wildlife
trafficking areas, as embeds in American em-
bassies and consulates.
Any penalties, fines, forfeitures, and restitu-
tion paid to the U.S. government for criminal
violations of the federal organized crime, rack-
eteering, and money laundering statutes for
wildlife trafficking offenses would support con-
servation efforts. This provides dedicated
funding for in-country conservation efforts for
highly trafficked and endangered wildlife spe-
cies, at no expense to taxpayers under our
bill.
Lastly, our bill includes provisions to crack
down on illegal, unreported, and unregulated
(IUU) fishing by foreign vessels or fraudulent
seafood imports into the United States. Ac-
cording to the U.S. State Department, IUU

fishing often goes hand-in-hand with
transnational organized crime, human traf-
ficking and forced labor, and weapons and
drug trafficking. American fishermen should
never be expected to compete against fraudu-
lent seafood imports harvested with slave
labor, especially in the Indo-Pacific region.
Madam Speaker, again I thank Congress-
man YOUNG (R–AK) for his partnership as the
original cosponsor on this important, bipartisan
bill. I urge all Members to join us in cospon-
soring the Wildlife Conservation and Anti-Traf-
ficking Act.

IN SUPPORT OF PAYCHECK
FAIRNESS ACT
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I am
proud to be a sponsor of the Paycheck Fair-
ness Act.
This Act is needed to stop discriminatory
practices by employers against our mothers,
wives, daughters, and granddaughters that do
the same job as their male counterparts.
It is sad that today in America, women
working full-time, year-round still earn 80
cents, on average, for every dollar earned by
men.
Women of color face the brunt of the in-
equality, with African American women earn-
ing 61 cents, Latinas earning 53 cents, and
Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander women
earning 62 cents compared with white, non-
Hispanic men.
This year marks the 10-year anniversary of
President Barack Obama signing the Lily
Ledbetter Act, which made it easier to sue in
cases of pay discrimination.
This legislation that we are discussing
today—the Paycheck Fairness Act—is but one
small step towards that end.
The Paycheck Fairness Act, will strengthen
the Equal Pay Act—passed more than 45
years ago—and as a result improve the law’s
effectiveness, and help to address the per-
sistent wage gap between men and women.
The Paycheck Fairness Act would:
Clarify acceptable reasons for differences in
pay by requiring employers to demonstrate
that wage gaps between men and women
doing the same work are truly a result of fac-
tors other than sex.
Deter wage discrimination by strengthening
penalties for equal pay violations, and by pro-
hibiting retaliation against workers who inquire
about employers’ wage practices or disclose
their own wages.
The bill’s approach would ensure that
women can obtain the same remedies as
those subject to discrimination on the basis of
race or national origin.
Provide women with a fair option to proceed
in a class action suit under the Equal Pay Act,
and allow women to receive punitive and com-
pensatory damages for pay discrimination.
Clarify the establishment provision under the
Equal Pay Act, which would allow for reason-
able comparisons between employees to de-
termine fair wages.
Authorize additional training for Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission staff to bet-
ter identify and handle wage disputes.
It will aid in the efficient and effective en-
forcement of federal anti-pay discrimination
laws by requiring the EEOC to develop regula-
tions directing employers to collect wage data,
reported by the race, sex, and national origin
of employees.
It will require the U.S. Department of Labor
to reinstate activities that promote equal pay,
such as: directing educational programs, pro-
viding technical assistance to employers, rec-
ognizing businesses that address the wage
gap, collecting wage-related data, and con-
ducting and promoting research about pay dis-
parities between men and women.
More importantly for our young ladies going
into the workforce it will establish a competi-
tive grant program to develop salary negotia-
tion training for women and girls.
As a Member of the Women’s Caucus I
have been fighting for pay equity for American
women since before I arrived here as a Rep-
resentative in 1995, and I believe that equal
pay for equal work is a simple matter of jus-
tice.
Wage disparities are not simply a result of
women’s education levels or life choices.
In fact, the pay gap between college edu-
cated men and women appears first after col-
lege—even when women are working full-time
in the same fields with the same major as
men—and continues to widen during the first
10 years in the workforce.
Further, this persistent wage gap not only
impacts the economic security of women and
their families today, it also directly affects
women’s retirement security tomorrow.
Now is the time for additional proactive
measures to effectively address wage discrimi-
nation and eliminate loopholes that have hin-
dered the Equal Pay Act’s effectiveness.
I urge my colleagues, both men and women
to support equality in rights and pay for all
Americans by supporting the Paycheck Fair-
ness Act.

HONORING DR. TWANA COOKS-
ALLEN AT CONGRESSMAN
VELA’S BLACK HISTORY MONTH
CELEBRATION
HON. FILEMON VELA
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Dr. Twana Cooks-Allen of Harlingen,
Texas for her exceptional service to the Rio
Grande Valley.
Since earning her Ph.D. in Counseling Psy-
chology and Marriage and Family Therapy, Dr.
Cooks-Allen has been an esteemed profes-
sional in mental health for over 30 years.
Dr. Cooks-Allen’s experience includes sup-
port to the Department of Homeland Security
and the Department of Defense, as well as
local and state agencies in Minnesota, Mis-
souri, Illinois, and Texas. Throughout her ca-
reer, she has helped patients struggling with
depression, post-traumatic stress disorder,
chronic suicidality, substance abuse, sexual
assault, pedophilia, eating disorders, schizo-
phrenia, and personality disorders.
Dr. Cooks-Allen currently works as Marriage
and Family Counselor at the Veterans Affairs
Texas Valley Coastal Bend Healthcare System
in Harlingen. She is also the proud founder of
the Veteran Kids/Teen Program at the Vet-
erans Outreach Center. The program provides
children of veterans with emotional, psycho-
logical, and educational assistance.
A true champion, Dr. Cooks-Allen also
spends her spare time helping our veterans
and their children. Every year she hosts a
one-week summer camp with activities, meals,
and snacks for the children of veterans. Her
goal is to create a place for these children to
discuss their concerns and fears and to re-
ceive support from their peers, while enjoying
activities. Not only does she dedicate her time

TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF MARY
ALICE O’CONNOR
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate the life of Mary Alice
O’Connor, a longtime resident of the Bay
Area.
Born in January 1943 to an Irish Catholic
family , Mary Alice grew up in Chicago, Illinois.
In 1968, she headed to the West Coast and
eventually settled in the Bay Area. While rais-
ing three children, Mary Alice worked in her
family’s printing business and later for a tele-
phone company.
Mary Alice was always passionate about
philosophy and spiritualism. In 1991, she pur-
sued her goal of bringing peace, joy, and com-
passion to the world by becoming an ordained
Unity minister. She served the community
through ceremonies for weddings, memorials,
blessings, and other events. Mary Alice also
taught inherent beauty and self-expression
through spiritual rehabilitation sessions, work-
ing to promote physical and spiritual healing.
In the early 2000s, Mary Alice became the
Executive Director of the Mt. Diablo Peace
and Justice Center in Walnut Creek, CA. Dur-
ing her leadership, the peace center became
an engaged and energetic community partner.
Mary Alice passed away on December 3,
2018. She is survived by her sister Margaret
O’Connor; her children Glory Marshall,
Sikwaya Condon, and Shasta Lockwood; and
her grandchildren Chavez Li Condon, Moses
Lockwood, and Jacob Lockwood; her former
husband Pat Condon, and her partner Willard
Davis.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA LOCAL PROS-
ECUTOR HOME RULE ACT OF 2019
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Local Pros-
ecutor Home Rule Act of 2019 to give District
of Columbia residents another important ele-
ment of the self-government enjoyed by all
other American citizens, including those in the
U.S. territories. The bill would establish a local
prosecutor’s office designated under local law
to prosecute all local crimes in the District.
Under federal law, the U.S. Attorney’s Office
for the District of Columbia, a federal entity, is
responsible for prosecuting most local crimes
committed by adults here, which is the greater
part of its caseload, in addition to prosecuting
federal crimes. This bill is special because it
effectuates a 2002 advisory referendum, ap-
proved by 82 percent of D.C. voters, to create
a local prosecutor’s office.
There is no law enforcement issue of great-
er importance to D.C. residents on which they
have less say than the prosecution of local
crimes here. A U.S. Attorney has no business
prosecuting the local crimes of a jurisdiction,
an anachronism that is out of place in any
American self-governing jurisdiction. In fact,
the territories of the United States—Puerto
Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American
Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands—all
have local prosecutors to prosecute local
crimes. The absence of a local D.C. pros-
ecutor is one more anachronism from the pre-
home rule days when D.C. had no local gov-
ernment. The goal of this bill is to give the
District the same jurisdiction over the criminal
justice matters that state, local and territorial
jurisdictions justifiably regard as mandatory.
Amending federal law to create a local pros-
ecutor would be an important step toward our
goal of achieving true self-government. I urge
my colleagues to support this important meas-
ure.
HONORING DONALD HAMM AT
CONGRESSMAN VELA’S BLACK
HISTORY MONTH CELEBRATION
HON. FILEMON VELA
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Donald Hamm for his positive contribu-
tions to the Rio Grande Valley.
Mr. Hamm was born in Montgomery, Ala-
bama and joined the United States Army after
graduating from high school. He was honor-
ably discharged from the military after serving
his country for six years. He enrolled in nurs-
ing school, and has served as a nurse in the
Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) since the
1990s. The welcoming environment and di-
verse culture of the Valley encouraged Mr.
Hamm to make Brownsville his permanent
home.
Mr. Hamm is an active member of our com-
munity, engaging in areas beyond the medical
field. He was elected 2nd Vice President of
the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People’s LRGV chapter. Hamm
founded the South Texas Mass Choir (STMC)
in 2006, and serves as its director. STMC, the
first and only Gospel Mass Choir in South
Texas, had its debut performance in 2006 at
the first ever Gospel Explosion in Brownsville,
Texas at the Jacob Brown Auditorium. Mr.
Hamm is also a pastor at the Kingdom Con-
nection Worship Center, and provides mar-
riage counseling to couples in the region.
I am pleased to recognize Mr. Hamm’s posi-
tive work in Texas’ 34th Congressional Dis-
trict. Brownsville is thankful for his service in
the military and the medical field. I ask my col-
leagues to join me in thanking him, his family,
and friends on this special occasion.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, the Honor-
able Howard G. Lane, Supreme Court Justice,
Queens County, 11th Judicial District (Retired)

COAL RIDGE CHEERLEADING
CHAMPIONSHIP TRIBUTE
HON. SCOTT R. TIPTON
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the Coal Ridge Titans’ co-ed
cheer team for winning the 3A Cheer Spirit
state championship in Denver. Their All-Girls
team also placed second in the All-Girls cat-
egory.
In total, the Titan’s co-ed team scored 78.05
points over the opposing Strasburg, which
scored 71.12 points. Bayfield placed third and
Alamosa placed fourth in the state champion-
ship spirit competition. The Titan’s success is
a testament to their strength, teamwork, and
dedication. Team members included: Kyla
Boyd, Andrea Jurado, Pilar Pagni, Kalicia
MacGregor, Haven Prodzinski, Cipriana
Dacuma, Paige Stecklein, Christian Vasquez,
Hartleigh Porter, Madison Balizan, Tana
Couey, Tori Byers, Brayden Kammers, Nathan
Tomasello, Nicole Elliott, Lacey Peterson,
Annikya Wight.
Alongside the co-ed team, the All-Girls Coal
Ridge cheer team placed second overall in the
state with an overall score of 68.02. Only four
of the 19 girls on the team had formal cheer
experience, which made their win especially
significant. Their endless work-ethic and ability
to overcome adversity, which culminated in
their ultimate success, should make them
proud. For many of the team’s players, this
win is the achievement of a goal they have
worked towards for years. I commend their
coaches and each member of the team for
their sportsmanship and competitive spirit.
Team members included: Olivia Oldham, Litzy
Martinez, Litzy Rivera, Morgan Bilodeay,
Jinessa Hayden, Valerie Capraro, Samantha
Sarmiento, Samantha Copeland, Leila Green,
Natalie Smyth, Aurie Madrid, Savannah Ma-
drid, Denisse Ortega, Odalys Quezada,
Brynlee Elswick, Phoebe Young, Cara Groves,
Rhaya Carmichael, Sydney Stanley.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to have these
incredible students call the Third Congres-
sional District in Western Colorado home, and
I offer my sincere congratulations. I wish them
luck in their future endeavors, and I am eager
to see what they will accomplish going for-
ward.

HONORING THE 10TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE AFRICAN AMER-
ICAN FIREFIGHTERS HISTORICAL
SOCIETY
HON. ELIJAH E. CUMMINGS
OF MARYLAND
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the 10th Anniversary of the
African American Firefighters Historical Soci-
ety. The African American Firefighters Histor-
ical Society was founded in Baltimore, Mary-
land on January 23, 2009 by two, now-retired,
members of the Baltimore City Fire Depart-
ment: Firefighter George Collins and Lieuten-
ant Michael Jenson. It was started as part of
an event celebrating the 55-year reunion of
the first African Americans appointed to the
Baltimore City Fire Department. While re-
searching the history of African-American fire-
fighters in Baltimore, it did not take long be-
fore they discovered that nearly every fire de-
partment around the country had its own story
of African Americans contributing to their
ranks.
The mission of the African American Fire-
fighters Historical Society is to collect, pre-
serve and disseminate historical data and in-
formation relating to the contributions made by
firefighters of color, and others who have con-
tributed to such history. This material is used
to educate and mentor firefighters and the
communities that they serve.
The Historical Society is also a 501(c)(3)
charitable organization, and it hosts an annual
Salute Dinner. This dinner honors African-
American firefighters, entities, individuals, and
dates that are significant to the fire service
history of African Americans. It is the only
event of its kind in the world, and they are
proud that the dinner has become their signa-
ture event.
All the honorees over the last 10 years have
been extremely deserving of their recognition.
Most have never had their contributions ac-
knowledged. These individuals are humble
men and women, who would tell you that they
were just doing what needed to be done.
Whether it be to acknowledge a heroic act or
some other significant act, such as being the
first to reach a rank or position, accomplished
by firefighters, the African American Fire-
fighters Historical Society is always interested
in finding these individuals. The organization
also welcomes information about organizations
who have reached historic milestones or anni-
versaries relevant to African-American fire-
fighters.
To show just how relevant The African
American Firefighters Historical Society has
become, I would like to take a moment to
share the stories of some of its honorees.
Stories of people like Edward Collic, who
faced significant hurdles to becoming Balti-
more City Fire Department’s First African
American Lieutenant Pilot. During promotion
testing, Collic was given ten additional naviga-
tion questions by his Coast Guard examiner,
effectively turning what is normally a 4-hour
test into an 8-hour exam. Still, he passed and
was reluctantly given his 100 Ton Masters Li-
censes. Collic worked as an Acting Lieutenant
for thirteen years, being passed over for pro-
motions several times despite consistently
scoring first or second on the promotion exam.
In some cases, he was deliberately removed
from the top of the list. Collic was finally pro-
moted, possibly becoming Maryland’s first Afri-
can-American Fireboat Lieutenant. With a rep-
utation for being the best Lieutenant Pilot, one
night he was sought out by his Battalion Chief
to respond to a train that had derailed with
hazardous material on board. He took his fire-
boat up the Susquehanna River to Port De-
posit, Maryland, on what would become the
longest run in BCFD history.
The Society has also honored people like
Mrs. Carrye Brown, on the 20th Anniversary of
her appointment to the highest fire service po-
sition in the country. In January 1995, Brown
was nominated by President Bill Clinton to be
our Nation’s first woman and first African
American to head the U.S. Fire Administration.
In that role, she was responsible for legisla-
tion, regulations and standards for all fire de-
partments in the country. To this day, Mrs.
Brown holds the record for the longest serving
person in that position.
They also paid tribute to civil rights lawyers
Kenneth L. Johnson and Gerald A. Smith. On
December 6, 1971 they filed suit against the
City of Baltimore to address discrimination in
hiring and promotions within the city’s fire de-
partment. This landmark decision changed the
hiring and promotions processes in both the
city’s fire and police departments, benefiting
countless individuals. Their 1973 victory ce-
mented the legacy of their clients and ren-
dered their firm a dominant force in civil rights
litigation on the east coast.
The Society has also honored the Gorham
Family. A tragic fire in August 1946 destroyed
the home of Leroy and Lillian Gorham. Trag-
ically, the couple lost three children: Jean,
who was 5, Ruth who was 2, and Leroy Jr.,
who was only 11 months year old. In re-
sponse, the community came together to es-
tablish Chapel Oaks Volunteer Fire Company
in Prince George’s County, Maryland. Without
any knowledge or experience, men from all
over the area started Maryland’s only African-
American Volunteer Fire Department. By the
year’s end, they purchased a fire engine and
equipment and began providing fire protection
for the Deanwood Park/Chapel Oaks Commu-
nity. They have serviced Prince George’s
County ever since.
The African American Fire Fighters Histor-
ical Society has presented approximately 200
flags flown over the U.S. Capitol for honorees
on significant dates of their accomplishments;
obtained almost 1,0000 Citations, Proclama-
tions, Resolutions, Certificates of Recognition
and Letters of Acknowledgment for honorees;
successfully advocated for legislation to have
a fire house named for an honoree; been in-
strumental in building partnerships, financing
the design, and advocating for local govern-
ment to establish The Racheal M. Wilson Me-
morial Park and Garden at the location of
Racheal M. Wilson’s death, the first woman
killed in the history of the Baltimore City Fire
Department, and sponsored Baltimore High
School students’ trips to Washington, D.C. for
Capitol Hill tours and to visit my Braintrust
panels at The Congressional Black Caucus
Foundation Annual Legislative Conference.
As the African American Firefighters Histor-
ical Society reflects on their many accomplish-
ments, they ask, ‘‘what’s next?’’ George Col-
lins, Founder and President states:
‘‘We are looking forward to creating a
brick and mortar entity in the form of a fire
fighter museum. This will showcase the un-
known and often buried contributions of so
many African Americans in the fire service.
Yet we will always fulfill the purpose of our
organization. Give people their flowers while
they can smell them, show them acknowl-
edgments of their accomplishments while
they can see it, and tell them how much you
appreciate them while they can hear it.’’
For these reasons, we stop to highlight the
endeavors of The African American Fire-
fighters Historical Society over the past 10
years.

HON. FILEMON VELA
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Brian McDonald for his contributions to
the Rio Grande Valley.
Mr. McDonald received a B.A. in Political
Science and History from Texas A&M Univer-
sity, and a J.D. from the Thurgood Marshall
School of Law at Texas Southern University.
After law school, Mr. McDonald settled in the
Rio Grande Valley, where he handled state
prosecutions in the Cameron County District
Attorney’s Office.
Mr. McDonald’s outstanding work and com-
mitment to public service led him to his current
position as an Assistant United States Attor-
ney with the United States Attorney’s Office in
Brownsville. In this capacity, he dedicates his
efforts to keeping the community safe through
the prosecution of federal crimes. Our commu-
nity is a better place thanks to his pursuit of
justice for all people.
Mr. McDonald serves as a board member of
the Cameron County Young Lawyers Associa-
tion, where he works to connect young law-
yers to the community through service pro-
grams.
I am pleased to recognize Mr. McDonald for
his successful career thus far in Texas’ 34th
Congressional District. We are all thankful for
his dedication to serving justice, and inspiring
the next generation of lawyers in the Rio
Grande Valley. I ask my colleagues to join me
in recognizing his potential and commending
him in advance for his bright career.

INTRODUCTION OF PRIVATE STU-

HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in support of the Private Student Loan Bank-
ruptcy Fairness Act, a bill I introduced earlier
today with my colleagues DANNY DAVIS and
ERIC SWALWELL. This bill would provide critical
relief to Americans in severe financial distress
who are struggling with overwhelming private
student loan debt.
Before 2005, private student loans issued
by for-profit lenders were treated in bankruptcy
like most other unsecured consumer debt,
VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:43 Jan 31, 2019 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A30JA8.009 E30JAPT1
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E111
January 30, 2019
such as credit card debt. Our bill will ensure
that privately issued student loans will once
again be treated like other consumer debt and
be dischargeable in bankruptcy.
Private student loans have much in common
with credit cards and subprime mortgages. For
example, private student loans often have on-
erous interest rates with no caps and can in-
clude exorbitant fees and hidden charges. In
addition, many lenders have used aggressive
marketing and high-pressure sales tactics to
target particularly vulnerable people, namely,
young men and women without financial expe-
rience, and older Americans seeking to re-
start their careers by pursuing higher edu-
cation and training.
To make matters worse, private student
loans lack the critical consumer protections
that come with federal student loans. For in-
stance, private lenders are not required to—
and typically do not—provide any of the
deferments, income-based repayment plans,
cancellation rights, or loan forgiveness pro-
grams that are available to federal student
loan borrowers.
A hallmark of our nation’s bankruptcy law is
to give an honest but unfortunate debtor a
chance to obtain meaningful relief. To that
end, the law exempts very few types of debt
from elimination through the bankruptcy proc-
ess, and only for principled policy reasons,
such as debts for child support, taxes, criminal
fines and intentional injury.
In 2005, however, Congress changed the
bankruptcy law without any substantive anal-
ysis so that student loans made by private,
for-profit lenders became very difficult to dis-
charge in bankruptcy.
Currently, the Bankruptcy Code prohibits the
discharge of private educational debt unless
the debtor, in addition to meeting the already
stringent requirements for personal bank-
ruptcy, proves that repayment would impose
an, ‘‘undue hardship,’’ on the debtor and the
debtor’s dependents. In practice, however, it’s
hard for a debtor to ever successfully meet
this standard.
The current bankruptcy law unjustly pun-
ishes hardworking Americans who are simply
trying to improve their lives by pursuing a
higher education and became victims of pred-
atory private student loan lenders.
We can do better.
I urge my colleagues to support the Private
Student Loan Bankruptcy Fairness Act and re-
store the fair treatment of private student loan
borrowers in bankruptcy.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FAIRNESS
FOR BREASTFEEDING MOTHERS
ACT OF 2019
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Fairness for Breastfeeding Moth-
ers Act of 2019, a bill that would require build-
ings that are either federally owned or leased
to provide designated private and hygienic lac-
tation spaces for nursing mothers. For years,
federal agencies such as the U.S. Department
of Agriculture and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention have encouraged
breastfeeding—the benefits are so great that
the Affordable Care Act amended federal law
to require employers to provide a designated,
non-bathroom space for returning employees
to pump breastmilk for their newborns, ensur-
ing that new mothers would be able to con-
tinue this essential practice even after return-
ing to work. My bill would extend this require-
ment to include not just employees, but visi-
tors and guests to federal facilities across the
nation.
In Washington, D.C. alone, there are mil-
lions of tourists who visit federal sites, such as
the Lincoln Memorial and the Smithsonian In-
stitution. Increasingly, families understand the
unique benefits of breastfeeding, and visitors
to these buildings who have newborns and ba-
bies should have a private space to
breastfeed or pump. The benefits of
breastfeeding are well-documented—
breastmilk contains antibodies and hormones
that boost babies’ immune systems, and stud-
ies have shown lower risks of asthma, diabe-
tes, respiratory infections, and other diseases
among breastfed babies. Moreover,
breastfeeding also has benefits for nursing
mothers, who, research has shown, have
lower risks of diabetes and certain forms of
cancer. Given the significant public health
benefits of breastfeeding for both mother and
baby, already recognized in federal policy, my
bill is a logical next step to ensure visitors to
federal sites have access to clean, hygienic,
and private spaces to nurse or pump.
It is also important to ensure that lactation
spaces are accessible to individuals with dis-
abilities. While the Americans with Disabilities
Act does not apply to federal buildings, the
lactation spaces required by my bill would be
subject to a similar law, the Architectural Bar-
riers Act, which requires buildings and facilities
that are designed, built or altered with federal
dollars or leased by federal agencies to be ac-
cessible to individuals with disabilities when-
ever possible.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill,
which would provide access to designated lac-
tation rooms for guests to federally owned or
leased buildings.

honor and recognize Chief Jeffrey Wise’s 40
years of service with Norfolk Fire-Rescue. His
selfless work, bravery, and dedication have
made the City of Norfolk a better place.
The health of our community depends on

of ‘‘preventing harm in the community and
maintaining the public’s trust.’’
His dedication to the mission is inspiring,
and I am confident that he has improved the
lives and safety of many in the community.
I congratulate Chief Wise on his retirement.
I commend him for his selfless work, and I

RECOGNIZING WILLIAM J.
‘‘HAPPY’’ FULFORD III ON HIS
RETIREMENT
HON. BRADLEY BYRNE
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. BYRNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize a pillar of the Southwest Alabama
community, William J. ‘‘Happy’’ Fulford III, on
his retirement as Executive Director for Gov-
ernment Relations at the University of South
Alabama (USA). After more than 35 years of
leadership, Happy leaves a legacy of devotion
to his alma mater, as well as lasting and
impactful relationships throughout Alabama
and the nation. There is no way to measure
the number of students, faculty, leaders, and
members of our community that Happy im-
pacted over his career.
Happy has been devoted to the success
and advancement of USA since his days as a
student. He graduated from USA in 1972 with
a bachelor’s degree, and he later earned a
master’s degree in Graduate Education Lead-
ership in 1991.
Happy is also remembered for his service to
our country, as he served in the United States
Army Reserve from 1972 to 2002. During his
time in the Army Reserve, he served in Oper-
ation Desert Storm and retired as a Colonel,
having commanded at the company, battalion,
and group levels.
During his service in the Army Reserve and
shortly after his undergraduate education,
Happy served as the president of the USA Na-
tional Alumni Association, connecting mem-
bers of the USA community throughout the na-
tion through his inspired leadership style and
outstanding personality. Happy continually
forged new paths for USA, serving as the Uni-
versity’s first Director of Alumni Affairs in
1981, its first Development Director in 1986,
and its first Executive Director of Govern-
mental Relations in 1998.
Happy’s list of achievements, experience,
and contributions will never be fully appre-
ciated. Few people in this life give as much
and ask as little recognition as Happy Fulford.
A founding member of the Higher Education
Partnership, a member of the Business Coun-
cil of Alabama, American Legion, Mobile Area
Chamber of Commerce, and many other orga-
nizations, it is clear that his outstanding serv-
ice knows no bounds.
As his well-deserved nickname suggests,
Happy is known for his easy-going, sincere,
and positive outlook on life, while also remain-
ing extraordinarily dedicated to the students,
faculty, and staff at USA.
As he enters the next chapter of his life, I
wish Happy, his wife Sherri, and his entire
family all the best as they get to enjoy more
time with each other. I know that in this new
chapter, Happy will continue to serve the Uni-
versity of South Alabama in every way he can
through his tireless efforts to make the stu-
dents of Southwest Alabama prepared for to-
morrow and making our community a brighter,
better, and ‘‘happier’’ place to be.

Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor George McShan for his exceptional
service to Harlingen, Texas.
Mr. McShan received his Bachelor of
Science from Prairie View A&M University,
with cum laude honors, and his Master of
Education from The University of Texas—Pan
American. He also earned a Master School
Board Trustee certification from the Texas As-
sociation of School Boards (TASB). He spent
his early years as an educator in the Browns-
ville Independent School District, as a high
school science teacher, and was also fresh-
man class sponsor.
During an extraordinary 32 year career at
Texas State Technical College, Mr. McShan
served as Chairperson of Academic Instruction
and Faculty, Dean of Instruction, Dean of En-
rollment Management, and Dean of External
Relations. In 1988, he was elected to the Har-
lingen Consolidated Independent School Dis-
trict Board of Trustees, and served as presi-
dent of the board for eight terms. In 1998, he
became TASB’s first African American presi-
dent.
Throughout his career, Mr. McShan has gar-
nered awards and recognitions for his tireless
efforts to improve the community, including the
‘‘School Board of the Year’’ award in 1993 and
the ‘‘Abrazo’’ award from the National His-
panic Caucus of School Board Members in
2006. Additionally, the mayor of Harlingen
named him the Chairman of the Harlingen
Task Force on Juvenile Crime, Graffiti, and
Gang Violence.
Mr. McShan started his own business in
2002, working as an independent consultant
providing professional education services, and
is a partner with BWP & Associates. He has
led school board governance training for over
thirty different school districts in Texas. He
has also conducted over twenty-five super-
intendent searches across Texas as well as
Arkansas, Alabama, Oklahoma, Louisiana,
Ohio, Missouri and South Carolina.
I am pleased to recognize Mr. McShan for
his successful career in Texas’ 34th Congres-
sional District. He is a role model for our chil-
dren, and exemplifies the best our district has
to offer. I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing his journey, his family and friends on
this special occasion.

RIGHTS LEADER, HEALTH ADVO-
CATE, EDUCATOR, CITIZENS,
MOTHER
HON. GREGORY W. MEEKS
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, Juliette
Alkins Hansen was born in Washington
Heights, reared in Harlem, educated in the
New York City public school and university
system—Juliette Alkins Hansen is a New
Yorker. Her Barbadian parents instilled in her
an appreciation and pride in her heritage.
Their participation in church activities (St. Am-
brose in Harlem) gave her grounding in learn-
ing how to ‘‘give back’’ to your community/or-
ganization.
In their 47-year marriage, Richard and Juli-
ette, individually and collectively, were in-
volved in civic and community life. Juliette’s
non-political organizational activity included
Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., the Girl
Scouts of America, Jack and Jill of America,
The Greater Queens Chapter of the Links, Ju-
liette was the organizer for the Queens Chap-
ter of the Links, York College Community
Quilt, various scholars hip committees, and
Magnet School Mentoring Program. Her board
member participation included the American
Lung Association; Jamaica Center for Arts and
Learning, (JCAL). After several decades of
JCAL board participation, Juliette retired. She
was named the board’s first Emeritus Board
Member and remains active in many of the
board’s activities. This association gives her a
continued ability to participate in the growth of
this invaluable asset to our borough and city.
She also served on the boards of Jamaica
Service Program for Older Adults (JSPOA)
and Jamaica NAACP. Being the Organizer of
The Greater Queens Chapter of the Links
brought her a sense of pride and accomplish-
ment. Juliette feels blessed that God granted
her the years to become a ‘‘Golden’’ 50-year
Soror in her dear Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority.
She is an Emeritus member of the New York
Chapter of the CARATS. Juliette and her fam-
ily are members of Saint Albans Congrega-
tional Church.
Politically, her late husband, Richard led the
way. During his tenure as President of the Ja-
maica branch of the NAACP in the early
1970’s, the chapter continued its tradition of
activism. As second vice president, Juliette
was at his side when the chapter fought for
Rochdale, the establishment of York College
in our community, fair housing in Forest Hills
and NAACP reform, et al. After his term
ended, the couple became associated with the
political campaigns of several local, city, state,
and national aspirants. They worked with oth-
ers in major fund raising activities for several
candidates.
Through her various organizations, Juliette
continued her connection with youth. She
joined Dr. Gerald Deas in his campaign
against ‘‘Quarter Water’’. These sweet colored
water drinks have been cited as being asthma
‘‘triggers’’ for young Black and Latino children.
As a board member of the American Lung As-
sociation and part of the Links Chapter, she
addressed New York legislators in Albany re-
garding the need for regulatory legislation
against such products. Unfortunately, these
drinks are still on the shelves.
Now retired, Juliette had 23 years of varied
experience in the field of education. As a char-
ter faculty member of the Queens Bridge to
Medicine program, she maintains an extended
family of former students, who have kept her
in their lives through graduate/medical
schools, marriages and children. Juliette was
honored with a nomination and placement to
Who’s Who Among American Teachers. Juli-
ette’s other honors include the Martin Luther
King Scholarship—St. John’s University; The
Many Faces of Queens Women—Newsday;
Community Service Award—Borough Presi-
dent Claire Schulman; Community Service
Award—Borough President Helen Marshall;
Community Service Award—Guy R. Brewer
United Democratic Club, City Councilman
Leroy Comrie’s ‘‘Unsung Heroes’’ and the
Queens Chapter of Jack & Jill honored her as
one of their past chapter presidents.
‘‘The greatest joy in my life has been my
devoted late husband, Richard, our loving,
statuesque daughters, Greer and Dionne and
husbands, Manuel and Michael. My three
munchkins (grandsons): Blake, Spencer, and
Richard are my supreme joy! I feel honored to
have received several awards from my com-
munity and to be blessed with many dear and
true friends . . . thanks for giving me my
roses while I can smell them.’’

THE LIFE OF FIRE CHIEF TOM
SCHULTZ
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in honor of Fire Chief Tom Schultz, the thir-
teenth Fire Chief for the city of Garden Grove.
Fire Chief Tom Schultz began his career in
firefighting at the age of 21 as a Fire Preven-
tion Specialist with the Fullerton Fire Depart-
ment. He soon became a firefighter, and later
a captain. After 2 decades, he became the
Training and Disaster Preparedness Officer,
responsible for the department’s overall pro-
fessional Fire training and for updating and im-
plementing the citywide disaster preparedness
program.
In 2007, his diligence earned him the posi-
tion of Shift Battalion Chief which allowed him
to oversee the daily activities of the depart-
ment. In 2011, while serving as the Deputy
Chief of Operations, he was assigned to facili-
tate the management integration of the Ful-
lerton and Brea Fire Departments. His exten-
sive work ascended him to become the acting
Fire Chief.
In 2015, after an established 30-year career,
he was chosen to be the Fire Chief for the city
of Garden Grove. Since then, he had proudly
and wholeheartedly served the residents of
Garden Grove.
Fire Chief Tom Schultz was known as the
‘‘firefighter’s firefighter’’. For more than 25
years, he had been a Fire technology instruc-
tor at Santa Ana College, training hundreds of
students with a passion for saving lives and
serving the community.
Anyone who knew Fire Chief Tom Schultz
can attest to his integrity, dedication, and hu-
mility. While he is a hero to many, he was
also a loving son, husband, and father to his

memory. We are forever in debt to his service.
Shall his legacy live on.

RECOGNIZING COACH ERNIE
AYERS AND COACH JOSH POWERS
HON. TIM WALBERG
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Coach Ernie Ayers of Sand
Creek and Coach Josh Powers of Madison,
both of whom will be inducted into the Michi-
gan Interscholastic Track Coaches Association
Hall of Fame in February.
Coach Ayers has been leading Sand Creek
to great success for the past 38 years. In that
span, he has amassed 17 conference cham-
pionships, 8 regional championships, two state
titles, along with another 9 top-ten finishes.
Adding to his accolades, Coach Ayers is al-
ready a member of one Michigan coaching
hall of fame, receiving recognition for his
coaching ability on the gridiron back in 2002 .
When he took over the job at Madison,
Coach Josh Powers recalled thinking, ‘‘Well,
how does Ernie do it?’’ That formula has
helped elevate Madison’s track team to an
elite program as well. While coaching 21 years
for both boys and girls, Coach Powers has
won a combined 22 conference champion-
ships, 11 regional championships, and three
state titles.
Despite all these honors, both coaches dis-
play a sense of humility, strong character, and
are role models for the high school students
on their teams. The investment they’ve made
over decades mentoring young men and
women and demonstrating the value of team-
work and perseverance will leave a lasting
legacy in our community.
Once again, I wish to congratulate Coach
Ayers and Coach Powers on this impressive
achievement and thank them for making such
a positive impact on a generation of students
in Lenawee County.

Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today in
honor of Dr. Deloria Nanze-Davis, a dedicated
educator, for her outstanding leadership and
mentorship in the Rio Grande Valley.
Dr. Nanze-Davis received her Bachelor of
Arts in Mathematics and German from Texas
Lutheran University. She earned both a Bach-
elor of Science in Accounting and a Master of
Education in Secondary and Higher Education
from Texas A&M—Texarkana. Dr. Nanze-
Davis capped off her academic career at the
University of Houston, graduating with a Doc-
torate of Education in Supervision and Admin-
istration, with an emphasis in mathematics.
During her 43-year career as an educator,
Dr. Nanze-Davis dedicated 34 of those years
to the Rio Grande Valley community. She
began as an instructor at the Texas State
Technical College in Harlingen, Texas before
teaching at the University of Texas Rio
Grande Valley (UTRGV). While a professor at
UTRGV, she was Chair of the Mathematics
Department for 10 years, created the Math
and Science Academy, and served as the As-
sistant to the Dean of Technology and Gen-
eral Education.
A leader and mentor inside and outside the
classroom, Dr. Nanze-Davis has made an im-
measurable impact on the lives and career of
her students. While she was Chair of the
Mathematics Department, UTRGV led the na-
tion for several years in graduating more His-
panics with degrees in mathematics than any
other university in the United States. She was
also deeply involved in the development of
Black History programs in the Valley to raise
awareness in the community.
Since retiring in 2013 from UTRGV, Dr.
Nanze-Davis continues to be a mentor and
tutor for many students in the community. She
proudly serves the Harlingen community by
teaching mathematics at the Student Learning
Center, participating on multiple city boards,
and leading youth activities at Corinth Mis-
sionary Baptist Church as its Director.
I am pleased to recognize Dr. Nanze-Davis

THE GATHERING PLACE
HON. KEVIN HERN
OF OKLAHOMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Madam
Speaker, I rise to shed light on an incredible
new development in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
A Gathering Place for Tulsa, the nation’s
largest privately funded-park, opened in Sep-
tember after years of planning, construction,
and anticipation. The park has quickly become
a beloved and cherished landmark in Tulsa.
Recently, the Gathering Place won the USA
Today’s award for Best New Attraction in the
country, a well-deserved honor.
While there were many amazing donors to
this project, the Gathering Place could not
have happened without the George Kaiser
Family Foundation.
I’d also like to thank Tulsa Mayor G.T.
Bynum and his predecessor Dewey Bartlett for
their hard work helping this park become a
centerpiece for our community.
The Gathering Place is drawing visitors not
only from Oklahoma, but across our region
and the country; it’s a testament to the excel-
lence that is possible with strong public-private
partnerships.

LIEUTENANT LEILA MORRISON
RECEIVING FRENCH LEGION OF
HONOR MEDAL
HON. KEN BUCK
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the service and sacrifice of Lieuten-
ant (Lt.) Leila Morrison, and to congratulate
her for receiving the French Legion of Honor
Medal from the French government. I believe
that our nation’s men and women in uniform
are America’s greatest assets. They have
made incredible sacrifices and deserve our ut-
most support and respect for their service.
Lt. Morrison honorably served to protect
America and her allies during World War II.
During the war, she served as a combat nurse
with the 118th Evacuation Hospital. Lt. Morri-
son worked in the pre-operation section of the
hospital and helped support wounded soldiers.
Furthermore, she cared for liberated prisoners
at the Buchenwald concentration camp. The
French Legion of Honor Medal is France’s
highest distinction for military and civil service.
Lt. Morrison is well deserving of this award.
Our nation owes no greater debt of gratitude
than the one we owe our veterans. They and
their families should be commended. On be-
half of the Fourth Congressional District of
Colorado, I extend my best wishes and deep-
est gratitude to Lieutenant Morrison.
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to recognize
Lieutenant Leila Morrison for her commitment
to the United States of America.

Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. LUJÁN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in
honor of New Mexico state Representative
Henry ‘‘Kiki’’ Saavedra, who passed away ear-
lier this week.
Kiki was a legend in the Roundhouse. A
longtime friend and colleague of my father, I
grew up playing with his young sons as our
dads worked together. I remember his laugh-
ter, and later, as I grew up, I saw how that in-
fectious spirit brought people together politi-
cally.
He was well liked and respected by every-
one, regardless of party. And, whether it was
infrastructure projects or funding issues, he
got things done because of it.
Kiki was truly a special person, and I know
his impact will be felt in the Legislature for
decades to come.
My prayers are with Kiki and his loving fam-
ily during this difficult time. May he rest in
peace.

Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to

physician of Internal Medicine for the past 32
years, specializing in Rheumatology.
In 1971, Dr. Nunnery graduated from Pur-

CAMPAIGN FINANCE LEGISLATION
HON. MARCY KAPTUR
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, this week, I
introduced three pieces of landmark campaign
finance reform legislation. Out-of-control cam-
paign spending has reached a dangerous
level in this country and we must reform our
campaign finance system if we are to restore
voting power back to the American people.
First, I have introduced a Constitutional
Amendment granting Congress and the States
the power to establish limits on contributions
and expenditures in elections for public office.
This amendment nullifies Citizens United v.
FEC. Additionally, the amendment concludes
that First Amendment protections do not apply
to the political speech of corporations and
other business organizations with respect to
the disbursement of funds in connection with
public elections.
Second, I have introduced a resolution ex-
pressing the sense of Congress that the U.S.
Supreme Court misinterpreted the First
Amendment in the case of Buckley v. Valeo
when it equated campaign spending with free
speech. It is clear that Buckley v. Valeo failed
to recognize that unlimited spending of money
on elections has a corrosive effect on the
electoral process. In order to secure free
speech as a right of ‘we the people,’ this mis-
interpretation must be reversed.
Last, the Fairness in Political Advertising Act
would require television broadcasting stations
to make available 2 hours of free advertising
broadcast time in each even-numbered year to
each qualified political candidate in a state-
wide or national election. This would help level
the playing field for viable candidates running
against campaigns bankrolled by special inter-
ests.
My entire career in Congress, I have served
in the People’s House. We, the elected mem-
bers of the House of Representatives, must
stand with the people, not major corporations
or wealthy donors who give millions to super
PACs. I urge my colleagues to support this
legislation and return the power over our De-
mocracy back to the American people.

CONGRATULATIONS HOWARD UNI-
VERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW CON-
VOCATION
HON. GREGORY W. MEEKS
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, through a
Charter by the U.S. Congress, Howard Univer-
sity School of Law began as Howard Univer-
sity Law Department on January 6, 1867, dur-
ing the Reconstruction Era, to provide legal
education to students committed to the protec-
tion of the rights of African Americans. During
this time, there was a great need to train law-
yers who would have a strong commitment to
help black Americans to secure and protect
their rights and well as the rights of other
marginalized communities. Howard Law also
has significant ties to the Civil Rights Move-
ment and other social movements that fought
for civil rights throughout American history.
Howard Law was the first school in the na-
tion to have a nondiscriminatory admission
policy, admitting both black and white male
and female law students.
Howard Law’s mission is to:
Educate and enable students to develop
their highest capabilities and skills as lawyers;
Engage as an institution in the active pursuit
of solutions to domestic and international
legal, social, economic and political problems
that are of particular concern to minority
groups; and
Imbue its students with dedication to excel-
lence and commitment to the solutions to
those problems.
Famous alumni and faculty of the school in-
clude Dean Charles Hamilton Houston—‘‘the
Man Who Killed Jim Crow,’’ Thurgood Mar-
shall—argued Brown v. Board of Education
and the first African-American Justice, multiple
Congressmen, senators, district judges, gov-
ernors, mayors, and the former Prime Minister
of Jamaica.

Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Mittie A. Pullam of Brownsville, Texas
for her dedication to educating our children.
Mrs. Pullam earned her Bachelor of Arts in
Literacy Arts from Samuel Houston College in
Austin, Texas, and her Master of Education
from Texas Southern University. After com-
pleting her master’s degree, she moved to
Brownsville, where she began her teaching
career.
Mrs. Pullam dedicated her life to enriching
the lives of African American children. She
helped establish Frederick Douglass Elemen-
tary School, Brownsville’s only segregated
school, and was both a teacher and a prin-
cipal there until the district was desegregated
in the early 1960’s, at which time the school
was integrated into Skinner Elementary
School. She worked at Skinner until her retire-
ment in 1975.
As the first African American teacher and
the first African American school principal in

reer providing our children with an equal op-

during a difficult time in our history. We are all
thankful for her critical role in fighting for jus-

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF
ROBERT ‘‘SCAT’’ SCATTERDAY, JR.
HON. DAVID B. McKINLEY
OF WEST VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. MCKINLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
remember the life of Robert ‘‘Scat’’ Scatterday,
Jr., of Wheeling, WV, a businessman, retired
professor, a Vietnam veteran, a father and a
friend.
Scatterday was known throughout our com-
munity for his leadership and service to oth-
ers. For over 30 years I had the privilege of
calling him my friend.
He retired from the U.S. Air Force as a
major with 37 years of service, including 136
combat missions in the Vietnam War. His mili-
tary decorations include the Bronze Star.
Scatterday spent 30 years teaching at Bel-
mont Technical College in Belmont, Ohio, and
treated every citizen of Wheeling, West Vir-
ginia, as part of his family.
Scatterday was active in the Wheeling com-
munity. He helped plan the Ogden News-
papers Half Marathon Classic and other
events.
He served as a board member of the Ohio
River Valley Council of the Boy Scouts of
America; founded the Golden Gathering in
Wheeling; supported the United Way of Upper
Ohio Valley and Young Life in the Ohio Valley.
Scatterday inspired all those around him; he
was a quiet, unassuming and humble man, a
caring and thoughtful father and grandfather,
and a wonderful friend.
He will be missed but remembered for ev-
erything he contributed to the Wheeling com-
munity and the positive difference he made in
the lives of so many.
Scatterday is survived by his four children,
his seven grandchildren and his large ex-
tended family.
May he rest in peace.

Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the legacy of Andrew J. Mulder
and his decades of commendable service to
the community in Holland, Michigan.
Two years after the start of his career in Oc-
tober of 1976 as the Deputy City Attorney for
the City of Holland, Andrew extended his re-
sponsibilities in his capacity as an advisor to
the Holland City Council. In 1987, after over a
decade of proven service, Andrew was pro-

capacity until deciding to focus the last five
years of his career on legal work surrounding
the new electricity generation plant of the Hol-

HON. FILEMON VELA
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Dr. Charles Rurangirwa for his leader-
ship and contributions in the Lower Rio
Grande Valley.
Dr. Rurangirwa earned his pre-med and
medical degrees at Montemorelos University
in Mexico. After medical school, Dr.
Rurangirwa completed a rigourous four-year
residency program in Obstetrics and Gyne-
cology (OB/GYN) at the King-Drew University
of Medicine and Science under the Drew/

mitment and expertise have been recognized
by his peers, faculty and staff. He has gar-
nered many accolades throughout his career,
including ‘‘Best Teaching Resident’’ award in
OB/GYN by Ortho Pharmaceutical, ‘‘Most Out-
standing Resident’’ award by the Drew-Univer-
sity of California—Los Angeles Class, and
‘‘Best Graduating Resident’’ by King-Drew
Medical Center; and acted as Executive Chief
Resident in OB/GYN from July 1996 to June
1997.
In 1997, Dr. Rurangirwa arrived in Browns-
ville and opened his private practice in OB/
GYN, providing years of care for women in our
community. Outside of the office, Dr.
Rurangirwa volunteers at the Mary P. Lucio
Health Center, a clinic in Brownsville dedi-
cated to serving those who cannot afford
health care. His contributions help the Rio
Grande Valley, and serve as an example to
our neighbors and the State of Texas in the
health and care of women.
I am pleased to recognize Dr. Rurangirwa
for his positive and compassionate work in
Texas’ 34th Congressional District. Brownsville
is thankful for his unwavering service and
dedication, setting an example for future doc-
tors in the region. I ask my colleagues to join
me in congratulating him, his family, and
friends on this special occasion.

VALERIE BRATHWAITE: JUSTICE,
MOTHER, WIFE, ADVOCATE
HON. GREGORY W. MEEKS
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 30, 2019
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, The Honor-
able Valerie Brathwaite Nelson, a justice of
the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court,
Second Department, which is the intermediate
Appellate Court in New York State, was ap-
pointed in February 2016 by Governor Andrew
M. Cuomo, making history as the first African-
American female from the County of Queens
to be elevated to Associate Justice of the Ap-
pellate Division.
Justice Brathwaite Nelson was educated in
the New York City Public School System, is a
graduate of Syracuse University with a Bach-
elor of Arts degree in Political Science and re-
ceived her Juris Doctor degree from the
George Washington School of Law. Having
married the greatest joy of her life Nicholas J.
Nelson, adding to that union three children
whom she considers her most important and
greatest achievement.
Justice Brathwaite Nelson began her distin-
guished career as a Law Clerk with U.S. Con-
gresswoman Shirley Chisholm, as well as
serving in a variety of public and private legal
capacities prior to establishing her private
practice of law. Her approach to leadership is
exemplified by her firm belief in the concept of
teamwork and empowerment. Her focus has
been to lead by example, while re-energizing
and transforming the culture of the judicial in-
stitutions she has led. Credited with making
tangible changes in the lives of women of
color and their families both domestically and
abroad through meaningful partnership, her
commitment to the Judicial System and her re-
spect for the value of our law resulted in her
receiving numerous honors and recognition;
Therefore, be it
That I, Gregory W. Meeks, Member of the
116th Congress, representing the Fifth Con-
gressional District of New York, congratulate
Valerie Brathwaite Nelson for her dedicated
service to quality legal practice. On behalf of

son for her outstanding and ongoing commit-
ment to making positive contributions to our

STAFF SERGEANT PHILIP DAILY
RECEIVING FRENCH LEGION OF
HONOR MEDAL
HON. KEN BUCK
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the service and sacrifice of Staff
Sergeant (SSG) Philip Daily, and to congratu-
late him for receiving the French Legion of
Honor Medal from the French government. I
believe that our nation’s men and women in
uniform are America’s greatest assets. They
have made incredible sacrifices for our country
and deserve our utmost support and respect
for their service.
SSG Daily honorably served the United
States and her allies during World War II. Dur-
ing his 25th mission as a B–17 tail gunner
with the 772 Bomb Squadron, 463rd Bomb
Group, 15th Air Force, SSG Daily’s plane was
shot down. He spent the remainder of the war
at Stalag Luft IV Prisoner-of-War camp near
Gross Tychow, Germany. SSG Daily’s
strength enabled him to survive the camp and
endure the winter march of prisoners. The
French Legion of Honor Medal is France’s
highest distinction for military and civil service.
SSG Daily is well deserving for his assistance
in liberating France from Nazi control.
Our nation owes no greater debt of gratitude
than the one we owe our veterans. They and
their families should be commended. On be-
half of the Fourth Congressional District of
Colorado, I extend my best wishes and deep-
est gratitude to SSG Daily.
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to recognize
SSG Philip Daily for his commitment to family,
community, and the United States of America.

HONORING GARY WEST AT CON-
GRESSMAN VELA’S BLACK HIS-
TORY MONTH CELEBRATION
HON. FILEMON VELA
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 30, 2019
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Gary West of Brownsville, Texas, for his
distinguished career as an educator for more
than 40 years in the Rio Grande Valley.
As a teenager, Mr. West attended George
Washington Carver Segregated School in Ed-
inburg, Texas until 1955. After graduating from
Edinburg High School in 1962, Mr. West at-
tended New Mexico Highlands University,
where he was a member of the college’s
baseball team. He later enlisted in the United
States Air Force. Upon his return from the
service, Mr. West attended Pan American Col-
lege of Edinburg, Texas, where he earned
bachelor’s and master’s degrees.
In 1970, he began his career as a history
teacher in the Brownsville Independent School
District (ISD) system, first at Cummings Jr.
High School, and then at Rivera High School.
An avid golfer, Mr. West was the golf coach
for the high school teams, as well as part-time
golf coach at Texas Southmost College, from
1970 through 2000.
He later joined the staff at Gutierrez Middle
School in Harlingen where he taught history
and coached the chess team. Mr. West dedi-
cated himself to providing students with the
best possible education until his retirement in
2014.
It is a tremendous honor to recognize Mr.
West. Our district and country are very proud
of his service, and his students and col-
leagues benefitted greatly from his commit-
ment to educating and developing young lead-
ers. I ask my colleagues to join me in con-
gratulating him for his work, honor, and ac-
complishments.
