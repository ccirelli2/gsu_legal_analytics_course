PRAYER
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer:
God of all creation, we give You
thanks for giving us another day.
Be mindful of Your people, especially
the Members of this people’s House as
the next funding deadline nears. In-
spire those who are in negotiations so
that next Friday would bring moments
of celebration and not consternation.
Lord, You are ever present, espe-
cially to those most in need. Show
Your mercy to the weakest among us:
the children, the poor, the elderly, the
homeless.
Send Your spirit upon all Members
that they might be inspired to do what
they are able, to care for those whom
You have favored from Biblical times—
the powerless and most vulnerable.
Bless us this day and every day. May
all that is done be for Your greater
honor and glory.
Amen.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-

f
AMENDMENT TO THE VETERANS’
CHILD CARE ACT
(Mr. HARDER of California asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute and to revise
and extend his remarks.)
Mr. HARDER of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today in support of my
bipartisan amendment to the Veterans’
Access to Child Care Act, which I spon-
sored with my colleagues from New
York, ANTONIO DELGADO and ELISE
STEFANIK.
Our amendment guarantees that if
our veterans suffer a mental health cri-
sis, such as one caused by PTSD or de-
pression, childcare for their kids is
covered during the crisis.
Let me tell you why this is so impor-
tant to me and the veterans in our
community.
A few weeks ago, I visited the
Stanislaus County Veterans Service Of-
fice and I spoke to multiple veterans
suffering with mental health problems.
A veteran in my district told me PTSD
was his invisible injury.
Roughly 20 percent of our veterans
who served in Iraq or Afghanistan suf-
fer from depression, PTSD, or trau-
matic brain injury. That is triple the
national average, and it affects our
communities in numerous ways. For
example, in my district we struggle
with veteran homelessness.
So, today, we are doing something
about it. This bipartisan amendment
helps ease the pain of mental health
emergencies for our veterans and
makes sure their kids are taken care
of.
By passing this amendment, we can
show our veterans, whether they are
from Stanislaus County, Essex County,
or Ulster County, that we can actually
work together in a bipartisan manner
to give them the respect and honor
they have earned.
f
HOUSE MUST VOTE ON BORN-
ALIVE ABORTION SURVIVORS
PROTECTION ACT
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Pro-
tection Act.
I applaud my colleague Congress-
woman ANN WAGNER for reintroducing
this bill, and I am proud to be a co-
sponsor.
This bill penalizes the intentional
killing of a child who is born alive. To
be clear, I cannot believe I even have to
state those words.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1468 February 8, 2019
Mr. Speaker, we have seen horrific
actions in New York and Virginia to
allow late-term abortion. This is essen-
tially the execution of a defenseless
child after birth. It is unconscionable.
The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors
Protection Act would require a child
who is born after an attempted abor-
tion to receive treatment and be trans-
ferred to a hospital.
Mr. Speaker, this is a sad day in
America when we have to discuss such
a reprehensible act.
Any doctor who would leave a child
to die should face the full extent of the
law. This bill would ensure that.
We must protect the most vulner-
able, and I urge the House to take ac-
tion on this bill.
f
IMPACT OF SHUTDOWN ON NOAA
WEATHER SERVICE STATION EM-
PLOYEES
(Mr. PANETTA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, we just
experienced our government’s longest
shutdown. For 35 days in California,
nearly 40,000 Federal workers were fur-
loughed and denied paychecks because
of the shutdown, and that number in-
cluded Federal employees at the NOAA
weather service station in my district
on the central coast of California.
Now, recently, I met with those
workers to hear how the shutdown im-
pacted them, and I can tell you that,
although they were affected by the loss
of pay, they definitely did not lose
their sense of service.
For over 1 month, right in the middle
of rainy season, with the potential for
serious flooding, these public servants
didn’t get a paycheck. They didn’t miss
one day of work, not one shift; and that
is why, in large part, in our region, we
were safe.
I can tell you, from what I saw when
I met these employees, these are em-
ployees who are not just doing their
job for the paycheck. They do it for the
weather; they do it for the science;
they do it for the job security; but
most importantly, they do it for the
service to our Nation.
As negotiations in Washington con-
tinue, we must learn from, we must be
inspired by, and we must be motivated
by not just my NOAA employees, but
every Federal worker across this coun-
try who has that sense of service.
We do that here in Congress. That is
how we not only avoid government
shutdowns, that is how we should gov-
ern.
f
CONGRATULATIONS COACH DAWN
SEILER
(Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr.
Speaker, in South Dakota, we take
great pride in our girls high school bas-
ketball, due to the incredible hard
work of so many players and coaches.
One of those hardworking coaches is
Dawn Seiler, who has been coaching
the Aberdeen Central Golden Eagles for
20 years. Before that, she coached the
McIntosh Tigers for 15 years
Under Coach Seiler, the Golden Ea-
gles of Aberdeen have made it to 18
State tournaments. And after her 596th
career victory, she is the all-time
winningest coach in girls high school
basketball history in the great State of
South Dakota.
Coach Seiler has inspired generations
of talented young women to do their
best, both on and, more importantly,
off the court.
Aberdeen is proud of their coach, and
they should be.
Coach Seiler, congratulations on
your historic accomplishment.
f
HELPING GRIEVING PARENTS
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, the
death of a child is a loss like no other,
and I extend my heartfelt sympathy to
any parents who face such cir-
cumstances, but our current laws leave
no time for parents to grieve and begin
the recovery process before returning
to work.
The current Family and Medical
Leave Act allows Americans to take up
to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for the
birth of a child or the care of a loved
one experiencing a serious health con-
dition. We need to extend these same
protections to parents grieving the loss
of a child, which is why I introduced
the Sarah Grace-Farley-Kluger Paren-
tal Bereavement Act.
This is bipartisan legislation. I was
proud to be joined by three Repub-
licans and two Democrats in intro-
ducing the bill. This is a commonsense
and compassionate step we should all
agree on.
I am particularly inspired by the
families of those in whose memory the
Sarah Grace-Farley-Kluger Act is
named. They have turned the pain of
the loss of a child into advocacy on be-
half of other families facing the same
terrible tragedy.
I urge my colleagues to join us in
this bipartisan effort to support par-
ents in the toughest times imaginable.
f
HONORING JUDGE MICHAEL L.
KARPF
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Chatham
County Superior Court Judge Michael
L. Karpf for 40 years of exceptional
service to our area’s justice system.
Judge Karpf has shown an unwaver-
ing commitment to fairness and wis-
dom during his tenure as a judge.
He has served on the Chatham Coun-
ty State court since 1993, where he has
had an enormous impact. Namely, he
created the major crimes division, ro-
tating judges and significantly increas-
ing the efficiency in our court system.
His colleagues remember him as a
consensus builder who could lead a
bench that works well together, an of-
tentimes unique accomplishment.
Earlier this month, he retired to sen-
ior judge status, meaning that he will
take cases on an as-needed basis.
I wish Judge Karpf the best of luck
and know that the court will be in good
hands as his son, Benjamin, takes the
role his father had as superior court
judge.
f
FIGHTING FOR MIDDLE-CLASS
FAMILIES
(Mrs. CRAIG asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Mrs. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I was
proud to be joined by Katie Brenny at
the State of the Union Address this
week, a fifth-generation cattle farmer
from Mazeppa, Minnesota.
In order to maintain their farm,
Katie and her husband, Ted, work day
jobs to afford healthcare and retire-
ment savings, and farm by flashlight in
the early morning and late at night.
Like Katie’s family, too many hard-
working and middle-class Americans
face similar barriers to economic secu-
rity. We should be working in Congress
to find common ground and solutions
on the issues that affect America’s
working families:
Affordable healthcare no matter
where you live;
Reliable options for you to get to
work;
Broadband at home;
Farm policy that prioritizes family
farmers; and
The promise of retirement security.
I will work with anyone who has a
good idea on these issues when it bene-
fits the lives of Americans. I hope that
we take seriously the spirit of collabo-
ration to get results for the middle
class.

MARGARET MASEK CELEBRATES

was given permission to address the

Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speak-
er, today I rise to celebrate the 105th
birthday of western Nebraska native
Margaret Masek.
A graduate of Gering High School,
Margaret has 7 children, 21 grand-
children, and 46 great-grandchildren.
In her 105 years, she has experienced

ELECTION REFORM FOR THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to speak in oppo-
sition of H.R. 1, legislation that was in-
troduced by the Democratic leadership
that they claim is for the people.
Let me be clear: There are some vot-
ing and election reforms where I be-
lieve Republicans and Democrats can
find common ground; however, H.R. 1
abuses taxpayer dollars, criminalizes
free speech, and encourages voting
irregularities. I cannot support it in its
current form.
One of the most egregious provisions
in H.R. 1 creates a 6-to-1 government
match to small donor campaign con-
tributions up to $200. This means for
every $200 that a political candidate re-
ceives, the Federal Government, with
your tax dollars, is giving $1,200 to a
politician’s campaign.
Since when does the Federal Govern-
ment become a congressional can-
didate’s ATM?
This is only one example of how H.R.
1 legislation is not designed to serve
the people but to serve the Democratic
majority.
This House should work in a real bi-
partisan fashion to create election re-
form that the American people deserve,
and I am willing and ready whenever
my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle are willing and ready to talk.

VETERANS’ ACCESS TO CHILD
CARE ACT
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
MCEACHIN). Pursuant to House Resolu-
tion 105 and rule XVIII, the Chair de-
clares the House in the Committee of
the Whole House on the state of the
Union for the further consideration of
the bill, H.R. 840.
Will the gentleman from the North-

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
further consideration of the bill (H.R.
840) to amend title 38, United States
Code, to direct the Secretary of Vet-
erans Affairs to provide child care as-
sistance to veterans receiving certain
medical services provided by the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs, with Mr.
SABLAN (Acting Chair) in the chair.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The Acting CHAIR. When the Com-
mittee of the Whole rose on February
7, 2019, amendment No. 11, printed in
House Report 116–6, offered by the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. CLOUD) had
been disposed of.
AMENDMENT NO. 12 OFFERED BY MS. SHERRILL
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 12 printed
in House Report 116–6.
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Chair, I rise as
the designee for the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. ALLRED).
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 2, after line 24, insert the following:
‘‘(c) OUTREACH.—The Secretary shall per-
form outreach to inform eligible veterans of
the child care assistance available under this
section.’’.
Page 2, line 25, strike ‘‘(c)’’ and insert
‘‘(d)’’.
Add at the end the following:
(c) PUBLIC NOTICE.—After the enactment of
this Act, the Secretary shall make publicly
available on a Department website notice of
the child care assistance benefit under sec-
tion 1730D of title 38, United States Code, as
added by subsection (a). Such notice shall be
easily accessible and visible and shall in-
clude a description of the expanded and cost-
free child care assistance for veterans, eligi-
bility requirements, and any additional in-
formation the Secretary determines nec-
essary.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 105, the gentlewoman
from New Jersey (Ms. SHERRILL) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New Jersey.
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise
to offer and speak in support of the
amendment by my colleagues, Con-
gressman ALLRED from Texas and Con-
gresswoman TORRES from California.
Our amendment directs the Sec-
retary of Veterans Affairs to notify
veterans of the expanded, cost-free
childcare services in this bill, and per-
form outreach to veterans and their
families.
Each of us have heard from the
women and men who have served and
sacrificed in uniform about the chal-
lenges that come from seeking access
to the benefits that veterans have
earned.
Last year, at a veterans’ roundtable
in Woodland Park, I heard from women
veterans that it is not enough for Con-
gress to enact a new provision and
think our job is done. We must direct
the VA to find the veterans who need
help and make sure they know and
fully utilize these services.
This straightforward amendment re-
quires the VA Secretary to provide
public notification on VA.gov about
the program, and to perform outreach
to inform eligible veterans. The VA has
significant and specialized resources
for our veterans. Veterans in my dis-
trict rely on services at the Morris-
town VA Outpatient Clinic as well as
nearby Lyons and East Orange facili-
ties.
I had the opportunity to visit the
Morristown Clinic last week and speak
with caregivers and patients at the fa-
cility.
I want every veteran, including the
more than 25,000 veterans in New Jer-
sey’s 11th Congressional District to
know that these VA facilities are there
for them. These specialized treatment
facilities are part of systems worth
strengthening and saving.
Mr. Chairman, we must make sure
that childcare resources reach their in-
tended recipients as we work to im-
prove care for our veteran community.
Only then will we see veterans coming
forward to seek counseling and other
medical services, secure in the knowl-
edge that their children have a safe
place during their appointment.
Simply put, this important childcare
program will not work as intended or
have the reach that it could without
informing our servicemen and -women
that it exists in the first place.
I thank the gentleman from Texas
for this amendment, and I wish him
and his wife—who is from Montclair,
New Jersey—well as they welcome
their first child.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chairman, I rise in opposition to the
amendment, although I am not op-
posed.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman is recognized for 5
minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chair, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Rep-
resentatives ALLRED, SHERRILL, and
TORRES’ amendment that would re-
quire the VA to ensure that eligible
veterans are made aware of childcare
assistance available to them through
this program via outreach and publicly
available information made easily ac-
cessible on VA’s website.
This program would be no good to
any veteran if they don’t know that it
exists and could potentially serve
them. This is a commonsense propo-
sition and I encourage all of my col-
leagues to join me in supporting it.
On a related note, I understand that
Representative ALLRED recently left
D.C. to return to Dallas for the birth of
his son, which is further proof of how
disruptive children can be to a working
parent’s schedule and why this bill is
so needed.
I wish Congressman ALLRED and his
family my hearty congratulations and
send them my best wishes during this
joyous occasion.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1470 February 8, 2019
California (Mr. TAKANO), the chairman
of the committee.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentlewoman for yielding.
I support this amendment because we
want every veteran who may be eligi-
ble to receive no-cost childcare to be
able to access it. If veterans don’t
know that they may be eligible to
place their child in childcare while
they attend their healthcare appoint-
ments, they may mistakenly think
they will have to miss their healthcare
appointments to care for their chil-
dren.
When veterans are not aware of the
healthcare benefits available to them,
or don’t know where or who to turn to
for help, the result can sometimes be
fatal.
When 20 veterans and servicemem-
bers commit suicide every day in this
country, and the VA under this admin-
istration only spent $57,000 last year
out of the $6.2 million set aside for sui-
cide prevention outreach, that is less
than 1 percent. The administration’s
lack of commitment shows.
As VA’s top clinical priority, we can-
not allow VA to continue to fail in its
duty to notify veterans of VA’s mental
health and suicide prevention services,
and that is why I support this amend-
ment.
If VA is not mandated by Congress to
notify and conduct outreach to vet-
erans, it won’t do it. Many veterans
who would benefit from cost-free
childcare won’t know it exists.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentleman has expired.
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Chair, I yield an
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman
from California.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I would
also like to quickly add that Congress-
man ALLRED, a new member of the
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, is ex-
pecting his first child any day now, so
it is very appropriate that we are de-
bating a bill today that will help so
many veterans who are parents of
young children.
I thank both Congresswoman
SHERRILL and Congressman ALLRED for
offering this amendment, and if it is
adopted, this committee will ensure
VA conducts outreach and notifies vet-
erans of their childcare benefits.
Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman
for yielding.
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Chairman, I
would just like to add that I hope that
the VA will do outreach with groups
like Welcome Home Vets of New Jer-
sey.
I have no further speakers, and I am
prepared to close. I reserve the balance

Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.

AMENDMENT NO. 13 OFFERED BY MS. MOORE
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 13 printed
in House Report 116–6.
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end, add the following new section:
SEC. 3. REPORT REQUIRED.
(a) ANNUAL REPORT.—Beginning in the first
fiscal year following the enactment of this
Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall
submit, as part of the annual budget request
document for the Department of Veterans
Affairs, a report regarding eligible veterans
who received child care assistance under sec-
tion 2 during the immediately preceding fis-
cal year. Each such report shall include the
following:
(1) The number of such eligible veterans in
each region of the Veterans Health Adminis-
tration.
(2) If feasible, the number of such eligible
veterans per facility of the Department.
(3) The amount of funding for such assist-
ance made available by the Secretary—
(A) for each region of the Veterans Health
Administration; and
(B) for each type of assistance specified in
subsection (b) of such section.
(4) Findings regarding—
(A) challenges in providing such assist-
ance;
(B) child care not covered by such assist-
ance; and
(C) recommendations to improve such as-
sistance.
(b) BIENNIAL SUPPLEMENT.—Not less than
once every two years, the report under sub-
section (a) shall include a supplement re-
garding the following:
(1) Other challenges regarding child care
services that prevent veterans from receiv-
ing covered health care services under sec-
tion 2.
(2) Plans of the Secretary to address chal-
lenges identified under paragraph (1).
(3) An assessment of the extent to which
lack of education by the Department or
awareness by veterans of the assistance
under section 2 contributes to a lack of use
of such assistance.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 105, the gentlewoman
from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Wisconsin.
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, I will be
brief. The lack of childcare is a serious
barrier to workforce participation. But
the lack of childcare is also a signifi-
cant barrier to obtaining good
healthcare, which is why I am so grate-
ful that we are taking this step today
to make it less so for our Nation’s vet-
erans who are in dire need of critical
services at their VA.
My amendment is simple, Mr. Chair-
man. First, it requires the VA to report
on the use of this new benefit broken
down by region. We need to have hard
data about usage to gauge the effec-
tiveness of this program.
Secondly, it requires a biannual re-
port from VA on other childcare bar-
riers besides the financial assistance
we are providing today that may be
hindering veterans’ access to care.
Now, while this bill may get us down
the road on improving care, there may
be other barriers to childcare that re-
main: the lack of transportation, as an
example; availability; or access to pro-
viders. While this bill is progress, we
can’t rest until all of the barriers to
quality and affordable childcare for
veterans seeking services has been ad-
dressed.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chairman, I rise in opposition to the
amendment, although I am not op-
posed.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman is recognized for 5

There was no objection.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chair, I yield myself such time as I

Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Con-
gresswoman MOORE’s amendment to re-
quire annual reports on the participa-
tion and funding requirements associ-
ated with childcare assistance, as well
as biannual reports on other remaining
challenges regarding childcare services
and recommendations for improve-
ment.
If we are going to create a new pro-
gram like this one, we have an obliga-
tion to ensure that it is serving the
people it is supposed to be serving, and
providing good value for our taxpayers.
I am happy to support this amend-
ment to ensure that this program is
closely monitored by VA, and that
Congress is able to use these reports to
conduct appropriate oversight of it.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chair, how much

I support this more amendment be-
cause we need to know how many vet-
erans and children are eligible for no-
cost childcare versus how many vet-
erans and children are participating in
this program.
Each region and medical facility
should know how many veterans and
children are eligible, and this report
asks for VA to report this data in the
President’s budget submission to Con-
gress so we can ensure VA is accu-
rately reporting the resources it needs
to make this a successful program.
Every 2 years, the VA would also be
required to report other challenges and
barriers veterans face, apart from
childcare services that prevent vet-
erans from receiving their healthcare
at VA.

February 8, 2019
This report is also key to ensuring
VA conducts the outreach and notifica-
tions to eligible veterans that would be
required if this bill passes into law.
This bill will require VA to assess
whether lack of outreach by VA, or
lack of awareness by veterans of this
no-cost childcare program is a reason
for lower participation.
This report would hold VA account-
able for not doing everything it can to
make this benefit available for the vet-
erans who need it. I support this
amendment.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chair, I strongly support Congress-
woman MOORE’s amendment, and urge
my colleagues to support it also.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chair, I do want to
thank the chairman for his support,
and I want to thank Members of the
minority for their support. This is so
very important.
I look forward to working with the
chairman in this Congress to continue
to ensure that the Veterans Adminis-
tration has the capacity and the re-
sources to do right by our veterans, to
respect the rights of its union employ-
ees, to provide the needed services, and
as you mentioned earlier, to make sure
that they get critical healthcare.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE).

AMENDMENT NO. 14 OFFERED BY MS. KUSTER OF
NEW HAMPSHIRE
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 14 printed
in House Report 116–6.
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr.
Chairman, I rise to speak on my
amendment to H.R. 840, Kuster amend-
ment No. 14.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 2, line 3, insert ‘‘to’’ after ‘‘required’’.
Page 2, after line 24, insert the following:
‘‘(3) The Secretary shall establish criteria
for providing child care assistance under
paragraph (1) designed to ensure reasonable
access to such assistance for veterans who
experience any unusual or excessive burden
to accessing child care services, including
excessive driving distances, geographic chal-
lenges, and other environmental factors that
impede such access.’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 105, the gentlewoman
from New Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER) and
a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New Hampshire.
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr.
Chairman, first, I thank the members
of the House Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee and our new leader, MARK
TAKANO. Time and again, this com-
mittee proves that Congress can work
across the aisle to pass commonsense
policy to improve the lives of our Na-
tion’s veterans. I also thank Congress-
woman JULIA BROWNLEY, my good
friend and colleague, for improving the
availability of childcare services for
veterans seeking mental health treat-
ment.
That is why I am a proud cosponsor
of H.R. 840, the Veterans’ Access to
Child Care Act, and it is also why I
proudly offer this amendment.
My amendment would ensure that
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs de-
velops and provides criteria to VA med-
ical centers that account for access
challenges when deciding what type of
assistance to provide these veterans.
This Congress has recognized since at
least 2014 that burdens to access are a
significant barrier to receiving the
quality healthcare that veterans want
and deserve from our VA. Mental
healthcare is no different.
In fact, access challenges are even
more acute for mental health. We know
that an alarmingly small percentage of
eligible veterans seek mental health
treatment, and we know that the vet-
eran community is in crisis over sui-
cide. We must do everything we can to
ease the burden to access.
My amendment would address one of
those access challenges that faces rural
veterans daily. It is tough enough for
veterans in my home State of New
Hampshire who have to drive hours,
sometimes through rain or snow, to re-
ceive the high-quality services at VA
medical centers. They should be af-
forded the opportunity to place their
children at childcare services closer to
home to ease at least one burden, car-
ing for a child while traveling.
But my amendment would also re-
quire the VA to provide childcare as-
sistance that is convenient to the vet-
eran rather than the contracting office.
If the VA cannot provide services at
the facility and instead must provide
services in the community, veterans
should not have to drive across town to
drop off their children.
Childcare assistance should be pro-
vided in a way that eases burdens and
accounts for geography and long driv-
ing distances.
In requiring the Secretary to develop
criteria, my amendment will force con-
sistency in furnishing this benefit and,
more importantly, require the Depart-
ment to really consider what it means
for veterans seeking mental healthcare
while also actively caring for their
children.
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor
of this amendment, and I am grateful
for the wonderful work the gentleman
does on behalf of our Nation’s veterans.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chairman, I claim the time in opposi-
tion, although I am not opposed.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman is recognized for 5
minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chairman, I yield myself such time as
I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the
amendment sponsored by Congress-
woman KUSTER to require VA to estab-
lish criteria for childcare assistance for
veterans who experience unusual or ex-
cessive burdens when trying to access
those childcare services.
Approximately 40 percent of veteran
patients live in rural or highly rural
areas. Those veterans have unique bar-
riers both to healthcare and to
childcare, and VA must take those bar-
riers into consideration when it is de-
signing this program.
I thank my good friend, Congress-
woman KUSTER, who is a tireless advo-
cate for veterans in New Hampshire.
Congresswoman KUSTER and I spent
Thanksgiving a couple years ago in Af-
ghanistan, visiting our troops. I know
her love for veterans and her commit-
ment to that and her work on this
amendment. I am pleased to join her in
supporting it.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr.
Chairman, I thank the gentleman from
Tennessee for his kind words.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from California (Mr.
TAKANO).
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding.
I support this amendment offered by
Congresswoman KUSTER, a former
member of the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee and a tireless advocate for vet-
erans in the State of New Hampshire. I
am pleased that our colleague, Con-
gressman PAPPAS from New Hamp-
shire, has joined our committee so that
we can continue to work on veterans
legislation for the veterans of the
State of New Hampshire and across the
country.
This amendment will require the VA
to establish criteria for childcare as-
sistance for veterans who need to drive
long distances or face other unique ge-
ographic challenges. I believe that this
amendment would also address some of
the concerns raised by our colleague
Mr. SABLAN from the Northern Mariana
Islands, where veterans must cross the
Pacific Ocean to access VA healthcare.
I also thank the gentlewoman for in-
cluding a technical fix for the under-
lying bill in her amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I support this amend-
ment.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chairman, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this amendment, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr.
Chairman, I urge my colleagues to sup-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1472 February 8, 2019
Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Chairman, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as
follows:
Page 2, line 9, insert ‘‘or extended day pro-
gram’’ after ‘‘child care center’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 105, the gentleman
from New York (Mr. DELGADO) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New York.
Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
No veteran in Upstate New York or
across the country should have to forgo
healthcare because they can’t access
childcare services. My amendment adds
emergency mental healthcare as a cov-
ered healthcare service for veterans
under H.R. 840.
As it now reads, the bill provides for
regular and intensive care, such as
monthly VA medical appointments.
However, it does not account for un-
scheduled appointments that, sadly,
can make the difference between life
and death. What if there is no time for
an appointment? What if the individual
is thinking about harming themselves
or others?
My amendment would allow veterans
to receive childcare services when
there is an immediate need for assist-
ance due to mental ailment, whether
from addictive opioids, post-traumatic
stress disorder, or depression, just to
name a few.
In my district and throughout most
of the country, we have seen the opioid
crisis rise to horrific numbers and im-
pact millions of families. In fact, be-
tween 2010 and 2015, studies revealed
that the number of veterans addicted
to prescribed opioids grew by more
than 50 percent, a total of 68,000 serv-
icemembers. This is quite a concern. In
my district, I represent more than
39,000 veterans, and much too often, ad-
diction and mental health are swept
under the table.
Mental health should not be treated
differently than one’s physical health,
and this legislation and proposed
amendment take significant steps to do
just that, helping to aid veterans and
their respective families with this
fight. Our veterans have sacrificed so
much for our country, and when faced
with a mental health crisis, it is our
responsibility as a nation to do every-
thing we can to provide for their well-
being.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chair, I claim the time in opposition,
although I am not opposed.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman is recognized for 5
minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chair, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Con-
gressman DELGADO and Congresswoman
LAWRENCE’s amendment to expand the
definition of childcare services to in-
clude extended daycare programs.
Many schools offer childcare in the
morning or evening hours to accommo-
date the busy schedules of working par-
ents. If those programs are a better fit
for the children of veterans seeking
childcare assistance under this bill, it
only makes sense for VA to have the
flexibility to use them.
That said, I have questions about
this amendment that I believe could
have been addressed had this bill gone
through regular order. For example,
would this amendment permit veterans
whose children are already involved in
these programs to deduct a portion of
the cost when they are seeking care, or
does this only cover drop-in care?
I am grateful to Congressman
DELGADO for his work on this amend-
ment, and I hope that we can work
with Chairman TAKANO to address
these questions.
Mr. Chairman, I urge all my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TAKANO).
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
I support this amendment because
veterans should be able to receive sti-
pends for extended day programs for
their children. Extended day programs
are before- or after-school childcare
programs that are generally less expen-
sive than traditional childcare services
and often include tutoring or other
academic assistance to children.
If placing children in an extended day
program is a convenient way for vet-
erans to make sure their children are
being cared for while they attend their
healthcare appointments, we should
support making this alternative and
often less expensive childcare service
available to them.
Mr. Chairman, I support this amend-
ment, and I urge my colleagues to do
the same.
Mr. DELGADO. Again, Mr. Chairman,
I thank Congresswoman BROWNLEY and
Chairman TAKANO for their efforts to
get H.R. 840 to the House floor. I urge
both sides of the aisle to support this
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. DELGADO).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 16 OFFERED BY MR. DELGADO
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 16 printed
in House Report 116–6.
Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Chairman, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 3, line 16, strike ‘‘or’’;
Page 3, after line 16, insert the following:
‘‘(C) emergency mental health care serv-
ices; or’’.
Page 3, line 17, strike ‘‘(C)’’ and insert

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to

from New York (Mr. DELGADO) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New York.
Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
My amendment would add extended
day programs, otherwise known as
before- and after-school programs, to
the childcare services that qualify for a
stipend or reimbursement from the
U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
under H.R. 840.
Extended day programs held at edu-
cational institutions, typically K–12,
are offered to students whose parents
have obligations prior to school hours
and/or obligations that extend beyond
school hours. They are a valuable edu-
cational tool. Recent studies suggest
that childcare programs that focus on
education rather than general daycare
services improve students’ academic
achievement and help close the
achievement gap.
In rural communities like those in
my district, going to the doctor can
mean a long commute, so expanding
access to childcare services is espe-
cially important.
Expanding such access is also vital as
we look to fulfill our Nation’s commit-
ment to support female veterans.
Mothers in particular often have to
forgo their own healthcare in order to
provide for their children. With more
and more women in service, including
the estimated 3,500 woman service-
members in my district, we must
prioritize ways we can help them and
their families. This bill is one way we
can do that, and adding this amend-
ment would just strengthen that meas-
ure.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chairman, I think we have these two
amendments reversed.

tleman seek to be recognized in opposi-

I think we have these two amend-
ments reversed.
Mr. TAKANO. Will the gentleman

Mr. TAKANO. That is correct.

Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chair, I rise in support of Representa-
tives DELGADO, HARDER, and
STEFANIK’s amendment to include
emergency mental healthcare under
the definition of a covered health serv-
ice.
It is a tragedy and a tragic fact that
approximately 20 veterans die every
day by suicide. We have perhaps no
greater calling on the Veterans’ Affairs
Committee than doing all we can do to
lower and eliminate that number.
A veteran in crisis must have the
benefit of every available support to
get them through that crisis and on a
path to healing. This amendment will
ensure that the lack of childcare won’t
be a barrier to care for a veteran in cri-
sis.
Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues
to support this amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Chairman, again,

amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 3, line 14, after ‘‘services’’ insert ‘‘,
including health care services provided as
part of readjustment counseling’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 105, the gentleman
from Maine (Mr. GOLDEN) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Maine.
Mr. GOLDEN. Mr. Chair, I want to
start, first of all, by thanking the chair
and ranking member of the committee,
Chairman TAKANO and Ranking Mem-
ber ROE. I appreciate their work on
this bill and the committee bringing
this forward so early on in the year.
I also want to thank Congresswoman
ANN KUSTER for cosponsoring this
amendment.
I offer this as one of many veterans
who has depended on VA mental health
services. Like so many other veterans,
I was diagnosed with post-traumatic
stress after my service in Afghanistan
and Iraq.
When I returned home to Maine after
completing my service, I struggled a
bit. It took me over a year to accept
that I actually needed help of any kind,
but when I did finally get to that point,
one thing that helped me was readjust-
ment counseling at a local vet center.
Readjustment counseling is another
term for mental health services that
help veterans and their families transi-
tion from the battlefield to civilian
life. Readjustment counseling helped
me to better understand that the phys-
ical and emotional reactions I had re-
turning from Iraq were, in fact, nor-
mal. Once I understood this, it became
easier for me to deal with these reac-
tions head-on.
I know firsthand how easy it is for
real life to get in the way of seeking
the mental healthcare that a veteran
needs. You will make almost any ex-
cuse that might come your way—or
reasonable excuse, sometimes—to
avoid seeking these services, so I think
it is important to knock down those
barriers and make it as easy as possible
for veterans to access the ability to go
to an appointment.
Knowing how difficult it can be
sometimes when life gets in the way, I
am not surprised that 10 percent of vet-
erans have had to cancel a necessary
VA appointment because they didn’t
have childcare. When you consider that
number, it is clear that veterans and
their families sometimes need access
to childcare so they can get to their
mental healthcare appointment.
This bill, the Veterans’ Access to
Childcare Act, makes that childcare
available to vets and their families
when they need it.
None of my fellow veterans should
have to choose between caring for their
children and getting the mental
healthcare that they need; and, just
like I did, many veterans need read-
justment counseling. My amendment
makes sure that readjustment coun-
seling services are covered under this
bill.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to support this
important amendment, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chair, I rise in opposition to the
amendment, although I am not opposed
to it.

Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chair, I rise in support of Congressman
GOLDEN and Congresswoman KUSTER’s
amendment to expand the healthcare
services under which a veteran would
be eligible to receive childcare assist-
ance to include readjustment coun-
seling.
The readjustment counseling pro-
vided through vet centers is an impor-
tant component of VA’s mental
healthcare system of care. I commend
Congressman GOLDEN and Congress-
woman KUSTER for making sure that
veterans in need of childcare assistance
so that they can attend appointments
at vet centers are able to receive that
assistance.
I thank Congressman GOLDEN for his
service to our great country. I think
we owe the gentleman a great debt of
gratitude and welcome him here to the
House floor.

associate myself with the remarks of
the ranking member. I thank Congress-
man GOLDEN for his service and, more
importantly, thank him for sharing his
story so bravely and forthrightly on
the House floor. I hope it will do much
to encourage other veterans to seek
counseling with the VA.
I support this amendment because
the transition from military to civilian
life can be a stressful time for many
veterans. When veterans are simulta-
neously caring for children, it can be
difficult for veterans, during this time
when they may be looking for or start-
ing a new job or starting school, to get
the mental health services they need.
They should not be worried about find-
ing and affording childcare so they can
receive mental health counseling and
healthcare treatment when the VA can
provide it at no cost.
Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague for
offering this important amendment.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chair, I support this amendment; I en-

H1474 February 8, 2019
Mr. GOLDEN. Mr. Chair, I also want
to thank Congressman ROE for his serv-
ice as well, and I appreciate the gen-
tleman recognizing that for me as well.
Having already thanked, with the
previous amendment, the chairman and
ranking member, I want to thank Con-
gressman BRINDISI for cosponsoring
this amendment. The gentleman comes
from a place similar to mine, a very
rural area, which leads me to the sub-
ject of the amendment.
Too often in this country, I think
that Congress can make laws that ben-
efit cities and urban areas without un-
derstanding fully how those laws im-
pact rural communities. I represent
Maine. It is one of our country’s most
rural States.
Almost a quarter of all veterans in
the United States, about 4.7 million,
return from active military careers to
reside in a rural community where
they experience the many rural
healthcare challenges that are only in-
tensified by combat-related injuries
and illnesses.
According to the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs, 58 percent of rural vet-
erans are enrolled in the VA healthcare
system, significantly higher than the
37 percent enrollment rate of urban
veterans. In rural areas, basic levels of
healthcare or preventive care may not
be available to support residents’ long-
term health and well-being.
Compared to urban areas, rural com-
munities tend to have higher poverty
rates, more elderly residents, and fewer
physician practices, hospitals, and
other health delivery services.
The Veterans’ Access to Child Care
Act would help our veterans and their
families get the care that they need,
but the program has to work just as
well for veterans in rural areas as it
does for veterans in urban regions. I
offer a second amendment today that
would help ensure this new program
works for veterans living in rural
areas.
The amendment would require the
VA to study whether the VA childcare
program is as effective and accessible
for veterans in rural and very rural
areas so that the program can later be
improved upon if it falls short in help-
ing rural veterans.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chair, I rise in opposition to the
amendment, although I am not opposed
to it.

Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chair, I rise in support of Congressmen
GOLDEN and BRINDISI’s amendment re-
quiring a report regarding the accessi-
bility and effectiveness of the childcare
assistance program for veterans living
in rural and highly rural areas.
As I said earlier this morning when
discussing Congresswoman KUSTER’s
amendment, approximately 40 percent
of veterans live in rural or highly rural
areas. Those veterans have unique ac-
cess needs, and VA must be mindful
when creating this program.
Mr. Chair, I encourage all of my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this
amendment today, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. GOLDEN. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TAKANO).
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
I support this amendment because
veterans living in rural or highly rural
areas face many barriers to receiving
healthcare. Childcare, whether for a
lack of convenience or its high cost,
should not be another roadblock for
veterans who must sometimes travel
great distances for their appointments.
This amendment would require VA to
report to Congress on the effectiveness
and accessibility of no-cost childcare
for veterans living in rural commu-
nities. This report can, in turn, be used
to find solutions for veterans who need
both childcare and healthcare in rural
communities.
Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for
offering this amendment, and I urge
my colleagues to support it.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chair, I support this amendment; I en-
courage my colleagues to support this
amendment; and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. GOLDEN. Mr. Chair, I would like
to end, again, by urging all of my col-
leagues to support this amendment as
well, and I want to thank the chair-
man, the ranking member, and the en-
tire committee and Rules Committee
for entertaining these two very impor-
tant amendments.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Maine (Mr. GOLDEN).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 19 OFFERED BY MS. SHERRILL
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 19 printed
in House Report 116–6.
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Chair, I have the
amendment at the desk made in order
by the rule.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 2, line 5, strike ‘‘Child care’’ and in-
sert ‘‘Subject to subsection (c), child care’’.
Page 2, after line 24, insert the following:
‘‘(c) REQUIREMENTS; RULE OF CONSTRUC-
TION.—(1) In accordance with paragraph (2), a
child care center, child care agency, or any
other child care provider described in sub-
section (b) may not provide child care under
this section if the center, agency, or provider
employs an individual who has been con-
victed of a sex crime, an offense involving a
child victim, a violent crime, a drug felony,
or other offense the Secretary determines
appropriate.
‘‘(2) Nothing in paragraph (1) shall super-
sede, nullify, or diminish any Federal or
State law (including any local law or ordi-
nance), contract, agreement, policy, plan,
practice, or other matter that establishes
standards and requirements for employees of
child care centers, child care agencies, or
other child care providers described in sub-
section (b) that are more restrictive than the
requirements specified in paragraph (1).’’.
Page 2, line 25, strike ‘‘(c)’’ and insert
‘‘(d)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 105, the gentlewoman
from New Jersey (Ms. SHERRILL) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New Jersey.
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Chair, I rise to
offer the 19th amendment to the Vet-
erans’ Access to Child Care Act.
The pilot program Congress author-
ized in 2010 to provide childcare at VA
medical centers and clinics around the
country is incredibly popular with the
veteran community. It provides a safe,
reliable option for parents who need to
access VA healthcare. This bill will ex-
pand the program so that all care-
takers, including parents and grand-
parents, can access this service.
The amendment I am introducing
this morning ensures that caretakers
have a safe and secure environment for
their children at a VA center. It bars
employment of individuals convicted of
a sex crime, an offense involving a
child victim, a violent crime, a drug
felony, or other offense the Secretary
of Veterans Affairs deems appropriate.
It also ensures that the bill will not
weaken State or local laws that en-
force rigorous hiring guidelines.
As a working mom, I know all too
well how important it is to know that
your children have a safe and healthy
environment while away from home.
Mr. Chair, ensuring our veterans have
access to childcare at VA facilities is
the least we can do for the men and
women who have stood up to serve our
country.
Over 6 million veteran households
have children. In my own community, I
have heard from the new generation of
Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, many
with young families, on the need for
VA to modernize services in line with
their needs.
b 1000
This includes local veterans I have
spoken to at our American Legion in
Woodland Park, who are working par-
ents with small children. They have re-
marked that the extension of this pro-
gram could be a significant benefit to
the veteran community in New Jersey.
This bill means less stress for our vet-
erans who would need to otherwise ar-
range for childcare to make an ap-
pointment. They have also told me
that this bill will help veterans make
and attend appointments because they
wouldn’t have to worry about arrang-
ing childcare. This acknowledges both
the needs of our veterans and creates a
support network for them.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1475
February 8, 2019
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chair, I rise in opposition to the
amendment, although I am not opposed
to it.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman is recognized for 5
minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chair, I rise in support of Congress-
woman SHERRILL’s amendment, which
would prohibit childcare providers
from providing childcare assistance
under this program if they employ an
individual convicted of a sex crime, an
offense involving a child victim, a vio-
lent crime, or a drug felony.
It would also stipulate that the re-
quirements in this bill are not intended
to lower any Federal, State, or local
standards for hiring or screening
childcare centers.
I thank Congresswoman SHERRILL for
introducing this thoughtful amend-
ment that recognizes that the children
of veterans accessing childcare assist-
ance under this bill must be cared for
in the safest environment possible.
This amendment is a no-brainer, and
I encourage all of my colleagues to join
me in supporting it.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TAKANO).
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentlewoman for yielding, and I also
thank the gentlewoman for her service
in our military as a Navy pilot.
I support this very important amend-
ment because veterans must be able to
trust that childcare centers and
childcare providers caring for their
children will not place their children at
risk.
At a very minimum, the veterans
should know that when they receive
their health services, their children are
safe. This amendment would prevent
an onsite VA childcare center, or any
childcare agency that has a contract
with VA, from employing anyone con-
victed of sex crimes, offenses involving
a child victim, violent crimes, drug
felonies, or other offenses.
Since State and local laws often have
even stricter standards when it comes
to who can be employed as a childcare
provider, this amendment would not
supersede those State or local laws or
any contract or agreement that re-
quires higher standards to be met.
At the very minimum, veterans who
need childcare so they can see their
healthcare providers must trust that
those who are watching their children
will keep their kids safe. I thank the
gentlewoman for offering this very im-
portant amendment.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chair, I support this commonsense
amendment and encourage my col-
leagues to do so also.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Chair, I have no
other speakers, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment offered by Ms.
SHERRILL to the underlying bill.
While I support the underlying bill, this
amendment is overly broad in that it would
prohibit qualified individuals from being em-
ployed under the bill if they had ever been
convicted of a drug felony or any violent
crime, even a misdemeanor. I support the
other exclusions included in the amendment.
The collateral consequences faced by indi-
viduals convicted of drug felonies, such as de-
nial of employment when otherwise qualified,
is counterproductive to the goal of reducing re-
cidivism.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from New Jersey (Ms.
SHERRILL).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Chairman, I de-
mand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentlewoman from New Jersey will
be postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 20 OFFERED BY MS. SHERRILL
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 20 printed
in House Report 116–6.
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 3, line 15, insert ‘‘, including coun-
seling and care and services under section
1720D of this title’’ before the semicolon.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 105, the gentlewoman
from New Jersey (Ms. SHERRILL) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New Jersey.
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Chairman, I rise
to offer an amendment to the Veterans’
Access to Child Care Act, which will
specifically include military sexual
trauma counseling and care services in
the definition of services eligible for
childcare at a VA center clinic.
We ask our servicemembers to risk
their lives and their health on behalf of
our country. They take care of us, and
it is our duty to take care of them, es-
pecially after they leave the military.
Over the summer, I spoke to veterans
in my district in New Jersey about the
inadequacies they see in VA services
for this generation of returning serv-
icemembers.
I heard from female servicemembers
about the need for better counseling
services for victims of military sexual
trauma, or MST. Several of the female
veterans at a roundtable I held this
summer remarked on the fact that
their voices were not heard in either
the planning of services or implemen-
tation of services.
Many of their fellow veterans did not
make important appointments due to
lack of access to childcare. Certainly,
as a mother, I would not feel com-
fortable attending counseling and re-
lating a story of sexual assault to a
counselor in front of my children.
This amendment is just one step in
what must be an ongoing effort in this
Congress to address military sexual as-
sault trauma. The Department of De-
fense estimates that in 2016, 14,900 Ac-
tive Duty servicemembers, men and
women, experience a sexual assault.
While this number is much lower
than the 34,000 Active Duty service-
members who are believed to have ex-
perienced a sexual assault in 2006, the
armed services still has a long way to
go to address military sexual assault in
the ranks.
The female veterans in my commu-
nity have remarked that because of the
trauma of military sexual trauma,
women often do not report it, and,
therefore, the number of veterans who
have been sexually assaulted is woe-
fully underreported.
These are the invisible wounds of
war—invisible trauma that we cannot
see as our servicemembers return
home. I am particularly concerned that
victims of sexual trauma, which is
prevalent in military and civilian pop-
ulations, are not getting the services
that they need.
This amendment will ensure sur-
vivors are treated with the dignity and
respect they deserve when trying to ac-
cess care at the VA without worrying
about the cost or availability of
childcare.
I take this opportunity to thank
some of the veteran service groups in
our district, like Welcome Home Vets
and SOS Stakeholders, who support
our veterans, give feedback to the VA
on the needs of our servicemembers,
and work tirelessly to connect service
providers with veterans.
I also thank Congresswoman KUSTER
and Congresswoman MOORE for cospon-
soring this amendment and their tire-
less advocacy for our veterans.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chair, I rise in opposition to the
amendment, although I am not opposed
to it.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman is recognized for 5
minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chair, I rise in support of Congress-
women SHERRILL, KUSTER, and MOORE’s
amendment to include mental
healthcare provided for the treatment
of military sexual trauma, MST, under
the definition of a ‘‘covered health
service.’’
Sexual trauma can have wide-ranging
implications on a person’s physical and
mental health. I am grateful to the
sponsors of this amendment for making
sure that MST is specifically included
in this legislation so that veterans who
have suffered this terrible crime will
face one less barrier to obtaining care.
I am happy to support this amendment

and urge all of my colleagues to join
me.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TAKANO).
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentlewoman for yielding. I support
this amendment because veterans, es-
pecially women veterans, who have
been victims of military sexual trau-
ma, often need intensive healthcare
services and mental health treatment
that can require frequent appointments
at VA medical centers, clinics, and vet
centers.
Finding convenient, safe, and afford-
able childcare should not stop veterans
from receiving treatment, especially
veterans who are victims of sexual as-
sault in the military and suffer from
the lasting effects of that trauma.
This committee, through the Women
Veterans Task Force, led by Congress-
woman BROWNLEY, will make access to
care for women veterans and their spe-
cific healthcare needs a priority of
ours. I support this amendment and
urge my colleagues to support it.

AMENDMENT NO. 21 OFFERED BY MS. SLOTKIN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 21 printed
in House Report 116–6.
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of section 2, add the following
new subsection:
(c) AUTHORITY TO CONSULT WITH SECRETARY
OF DEFENSE.—In implementing section 1730D
of title 38, United States Code, as added by
subsection (a), the Secretary of Veterans Af-
fairs may consult with the Secretary of De-
fense.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 105, the gentlewoman
from Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan.
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today to offer an amendment to H.R.
840, the Veterans’ Access to Child Care
Act.
As a former national security offi-
cial, as the wife of a retired Army offi-
cer, and a stepmom to a new Army
lieutenant, I strongly support H.R. 840,
the Veterans’ Access to Child Care Act,
and any legislation that helps our vet-
erans access and use VA healthcare
that they have earned and to which
they are entitled.
My amendment would take a simple
but important step toward better serv-
ing military families and veterans.
Specifically, it would authorize the
Secretary of Veterans’ Affairs to con-
sult with the Secretary of Defense in
implementing this legislation.
The need for better DOD-VA coordi-
nation on every front is not new. From
education to job training and
healthcare, Congress has taken many
steps to encourage, to prod, to require,
and, in some cases, to demand that
DOD and the VA work together and
better coordinate the services they pro-
vide to military families and veterans.
And as I can tell you from very per-
sonal experience, you do not have to
spend much time with veterans in my
district to know the stories of faulty
connections, gaps in communication,
and mismatched systems that confound
our ability to serve military families
and veterans evenly.
I am standing here today because I
believe we should take every oppor-
tunity to encourage the kind of coordi-
nation that eases these connections.
Childcare is an area in which DOD and
the VA can and should collaborate
more closely, especially as the two de-
partments work to better coordinate
the provision of healthcare benefits to
millions of retirees and their families.
The Veterans’ Access to Child Care
Act would add valuable childcare serv-
ices to VA patients to help them keep
vital medical appointments that they
might otherwise have missed in the ab-
sence of childcare options.
Simultaneously, the Department of
Defense has been working to expand
childcare options for military families,
addressing an urgent need for services
that don’t just care for families, but
contribute to military readiness.
Both of these efforts are vitally im-
portant, which means that the Depart-
ment of Defense and VA should look
for any opportunity to work together
and expand childcare options for the
families they serve. What’s more, thou-
sands of military members on Active
Duty and in the Reserve component are
married to veterans. Thousands of dual
military families today will eventually
become military and veteran families
tomorrow, and my stepdaughter is
married to a military officer, so this
one is particularly personal.
This is just another reason that co-
ordination between the Department of
Defense and VA childcare programs can
help us better serve these populations.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support my amendment to push for
stronger coordination between the VA
and the Department of Defense.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chair, I rise in opposition to the
amendment, although I am not opposed
to it.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Tennessee is
recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chair, I rise in support of Congress-
woman SLOTKIN’s amendment to au-
thorize consultation between the Sec-
retaries of Defense and Veterans’ Af-
fairs in the implementation of this
childcare assistance program.
Ensuring greater collaboration be-
tween VA and DOD has long been a pri-
ority of mine, so I am pleased to sup-
port this amendment today.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TAKANO).
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentlewoman for yielding. I rise to sup-
port this amendment because it would
allow the VA to consult with the De-
partment of Defense on the implemen-
tation of this bill.
Since DOD provides childcare for
servicemembers and their families, VA
can look to DOD for best practices so
that it can successfully and efficiently
expand this program so that every vet-
eran eligible for no-cost childcare
while they are receiving healthcare
services can access this benefit when
they need it.
I thank the Congresswoman for offer-
ing this amendment, and I urge my col-
leagues to support it. I might also add
that I am pleased to see so many of the
amendments that my colleagues of-
fered today are adopted. I hope that
when we vote on this much improved
bill, it will pass with unanimous sup-
port so that I can advocate for its swift
passage with my Senate colleagues.
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Chair, I support this commonsense
amendment and encourage my col-
leagues to do so.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.

MOMENT OF SILENCE IN MEMORY OF THE
HONORABLE JOHN DAVID DINGELL, JR.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, my fel-
low colleagues, I rise with great sad-
ness to announce the passing of one of
this House’s great and good Members,
former Representative John David Din-
gell, Jr., who served in this House for
almost a full six decades. His father
preceded him for 22 years, and his wife,
our beloved colleague, DEBBIE DINGELL,
serves now.
At the request of his beloved wife, I
have the sad task of informing the
House that John died yesterday after a
long, distinguished, and committed ca-
reer of service to community, to this
House, and to his country.
John served with honor in wartime
and with distinction in this House. He
worked for the advancement of his fel-
low veterans and their care and bene-
fits in peacetime, and he fought all of
his life for fairness and opportunity for
all. He defended vigorously the work-
ing men and women of the auto indus-
try and working families everywhere.
His wit, his humor brought smiles to
our faces, and his fearless questions of
witnesses in committee brought grim-
aces to those who believed they had un-
dermined the safety and health of our
citizens.
Much will be said. I know that each
of you have your own memory of Chair-
man Dingell. I know that each of you
will want to rise at some point in time
over the next number of days to give
your observations of this colleague
with whom we were honored to serve.
Let us begin our remembrances of
him, however, by celebrating the love
that he had for this great institution
about which he cared so deeply. He be-
lieved its powers to be: improving peo-
ple’s lives and delivering on the prom-
ises of those who came before us and to
those who will come after us.
May John’s legacy guide us forward
as we seek to make this House all he
believed it could be and all he did to
make it so better than it might have
been.
I now yield to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. PELOSI), the distin-
guished Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives.
Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman
for yielding and for his beautiful state-
ment of our beloved Mr. Dingell, Mr.
Chairman.
Mr. Chair, again, as he mentioned
last night, our Nation lost a beloved
pillar of this Congress and one of the
greatest legislators in American his-
tory.
Every chapter of Chairman John Din-
gell’s life was lived in service to our
country, from his time as a House
page, as a teenager, to his service in
the Army during World War II, to his
almost six decades serving the people
of Michigan in the U.S. Congress.
John Dingell leaves a towering leg-
acy of unshakeable strength, boundless
energy, and transformative leadership.
Chairman Dingell had a hand in
crafting many major legislative accom-
plishments over the past half century,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1478 February 8, 2019
yet among the vast array of historic
legislative achievements, few hold
greater meaning than his tireless com-
mitment to the health of the American
people.
During every Congress since 1955,
Chairman Dingell introduced legisla-
tion to secure affordable, quality
healthcare for all Americans.
Because of his father’s legacy, which
our distinguished leader has ref-
erenced, and his own leadership, in
1965, he gaveled Medicare into law. In
2010, it was my privilege to hold that
same gavel as we passed the Affordable
Care Act.
Chairman Dingell was our distin-
guished dean and chairman, our leg-
endary colleague, and a beloved friend.
His memory will stand as an inspira-
tion to all who worked with him or for
him or had the pleasure of knowing
him.
His leadership will endure in the lives
of the millions of American families he
touched. We hope it is a comfort to
Chairman Dingell’s beloved wife, dear
DEBORAH, Congresswoman DEBBIE DIN-
GELL, and their entire family that so
many people mourn their loss and pray
for them at this sad time.
I am pleased to mention that the flag
is flying half-staff over the Capitol in
his memory and invite Members to sign
the condolence book in the Speaker’s
lobby.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chair, I thank the
Speaker for her retelling, very briefly,
the extraordinary record of our friend
and colleague, John Dingell, who made
America better, who made this House
better, and who believed that in doing
so, it was critically important to reach
across the aisle, to have legislation
that would enjoy the support of both
sides of the aisle.
In that regard, I am blessed now to
yield to the gentleman from California
(Mr. MCCARTHY), the Republican leader
and my friend.
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Chair, I also
rise to commemorate the incredible
life and career of John Dingell, the
former dean of this House.
Few individuals have amassed a
record of public service that could rival
John’s, and I will bet no one will ever
match it—59 years as an elected Rep-
resentative.
In fact, his interest in politics began
during his time as a congressional
page, where he personally witnessed
FDR’s ‘‘a day that will live in infamy’’
speech from this very podium.
Take one moment to think of the life
that this man has witnessed on this
floor.
John taught us that public service is
not a sprint, but a marathon. There are
many lessons in his life that we can
learn from, but I hope we take that les-
son every day when we come to work
here.
Another lesson I hope we learn is the
one how I first met John. He was an
icon before I got here. But I watched
the respect, not from his own col-
leagues in his own party, but the re-
spect from across the aisle.
They went to John for advice. When
he walked on the floor, there were
many on our side who stood around
him to question him where he thought
we could go.
He believed in this House; he believed
in this country.
He had great passions: passion for his
constituents; passion for his com-
mittee, Energy and Commerce. He
loved that committee so much, he
thought there needed to be no other
committee in this House. It wasn’t
until his retirement that we got juris-
diction back in other places.
But he understood an ever-changing
world, if you can only imagine serving
that long. He was able to adapt, which
we should learn from him, too.
Yes, the new world of social media
many would think would pass him by
because of his age. He was one of the
first I would follow on Twitter.
And this is a lesson that this House,
in a bipartisan manner, should take. It
is one of my favorite tweets from John.
It came in July of 2017. He wrote: ‘‘I’ve
been trying to repeal and replace the
United States Senate since 1955. No
luck.’’
Yes, we are sad today, but he lived a
life we could admire. I may have dif-
ferences of opinion and philosophy with
him, but I admired his will to fight for
what he believed in. I admired the way
he treated people who had different be-
liefs, and I admired the way he believed
all sides should be heard.
I speak for everyone on this side of
the aisle to convey our deepest sym-
pathies, and to DEBBIE, and I ask that
we lift him up in our prayers to God for
his soul to rest peacefully, and to re-
member what he truly believed: public
service matters; this country matters;
and the ability to work together so all
Americans will have a better tomorrow
matters.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chair, I thank the
majority leader for his remarks.
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Chair, I thank
the gentleman for the promotion.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chair, the spirit of
John Dingell was so present in that re-
mark.
Now, John Dingell apparently was
not always right. He wanted to repeal
the Senate, but then he wanted to re-
place it.
Mr. Chair, John Dingell, I will tell
you, I was with him Wednesday from
approximately 4 p.m. on Wednesday
until 6:30 p.m., and DEBBIE was there.
Your dad was there, ANDY, our dear
colleague. Sandy Levin was there and
John Orlando, who served with John on
the Energy and Commerce Committee
for such a great time. He remembered
all of you. He asked me to give each of
you his best, to wish you well, and to
say that our country needs each of us
to work together.
Would that we could leave just some
of the legacy that John Dingell has left
behind. We are so blessed that we have
the opportunity to serve with his wife,
his beloved wife, his lovely DEBORAH.
What an extraordinary relationship,
what an extraordinary man. How lucky
we were and are to serve with them.
The Speaker will be shortly notifying
us of when the funeral will be, opportu-
nities to go to the funeral. There will
be a memorial service as well, here,
and probably a service in the Capitol as
well. So there will be opportunities for
each of us to stand and testify to the
greatness and goodness of John David
Dingell, Jr.
Mr. Chair, I ask all the Members of
Congress and all the ladies and gentle-
men in the gallery to join us in a mo-
ment of silence in remembrance of our
friend John Dingell.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. PALLONE).
All present will rise and observe a mo-
ment of silence in honor of our beloved
John Dingell.
AMENDMENT NO. 19 OFFERED BY MS. SHERRILL
The Acting CHAIR. The unfinished
business is the demand for a recorded

Mrs. BEATTY changed her vote from
‘‘no’’ to ‘‘aye.’’
So the amendment was agreed to.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment in the nature of a
substitute, as amended.
The amendment was agreed to.
The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule,
the Committee rises.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.
BUTTERFIELD) having assumed the
chair, Mr. PALLONE, Acting Chair of
the Committee of the Whole House on
the state of the Union, reported that
that Committee, having had under con-
sideration the bill (H.R. 840) to amend
title 38, United States Code, to direct
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to
provide child care assistance to vet-
erans receiving certain medical serv-
ices provided by the Department of
Veterans Affairs, and, pursuant to
House Resolution 105, he reported the
bill back to the House with an amend-
ment adopted in the Committee of the
Whole.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the rule, the previous question is or-
dered.
Is a separate vote demanded on any
amendment to the amendment re-
ported from the Committee of the
Whole?
If not, the question is on the amend-
ment in the nature of a substitute, as
amended.
The amendment was agreed to.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the engrossment and
third reading of the bill.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed
and read a third time, and was read the
third time.
MOTION TO RECOMMIT
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I have a mo-
tion to recommit at the desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the
gentleman opposed to the bill?
Mr. BARR. I am in its current form.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit.
The Clerk read as follows:
Mr. Barr moves to recommit the bill H.R.
840 to the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs
with instructions to report the same back to
the House forthwith, with the following
amendment:
At the end of section 1730D of title 38,
United States Code, as proposed to be added
by section 2 of the bill, add the following new
subsection:
‘‘(e) ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CHILD
CARE PROVIDERS.—(1) Subject to paragraph
(2), no payment may be made under this sec-
tion to a child care center, child care agency,
or child care provider described in subsection
(b) that employs an individual who has been
charged with—
‘‘(A) a sex offense;
‘‘(B) an offense involving a child victim;
‘‘(C) a violent crime;
‘‘(D) a drug felony; or
‘‘(E) other offense that the Secretary de-
termines appropriate.
‘‘(2) Payment may be made under this sec-
tion to a child care center, child care agency,
or child care provider described in subsection
(b) if such child care center, child care agen-
cy, or child care provider has suspended the
individual described in paragraph (1) from
having any contact with children while on
the job until the case is resolved.’’.
Mr. BARR (during the reading). Mr.
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to
dispense with the reading.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Kentucky?
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Kentucky is recognized
for 5 minutes.
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, just a few
minutes ago, we adopted, by a recorded
vote, a commonsense amendment of-
fered by Congresswoman MIKIE
SHERRILL from New Jersey. Congress-
woman SHERRILL’s amendment would
prohibit a childcare center, agency, or
provider from caring for the children of
our Nation’s veterans as authorized by
this bill if they employ an individual
who has been convicted of a sex crime,
a violent crime, a drug felony, or an-
other offense the VA considers appro-
priate.
Mr. Speaker, I applaud Congress-
woman SHERRILL for offering her
amendment, which I was pleased to
join my colleagues in supporting on a
bipartisan basis. However, Ms.
SHERRILL’s amendment failed to ad-
dress another troubling situation, a
situation that, if this bill had gone
through regular order, may have been
identified.
Specifically, Federal law allows but
does not require a childcare facility op-
erated by a Federal agency or under
contract with a Federal agency to sus-
pend a childcare worker if they have
been charged with a sex crime, an of-
fense involving a child victim, a vio-
lent crime, or a drug felony, but whose
charge is still pending.
My motion to recommit, Mr. Speak-
er, is very simple. It would remove that
discretion and affirmatively prohibit
the VA from paying a childcare pro-
vider if they employ an individual who
has been charged with a sex offense, an
offense involving a child victim, a vio-
lent crime, a drug felony, or other of-
fense that the Secretary determines
appropriate unless the childcare pro-
vider has suspended that individual
from having any contact with any chil-
dren while on the job until the case has
been resolved.
It can take a considerable amount of
time for some cases to proceed through
our criminal justice system. For exam-
ple, in 2013, a nursing assistant at the
Alexandria VA Healthcare System in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1480 February 8, 2019
Pineville, Louisiana, was charged with
negligent homicide after a physical al-
tercation with a veteran patient who
later died. In 2018, 5 years later, that
case finally came to a resolution when
the nursing assistant pleaded no con-
test.
During those intervening 5 years,
that nursing assistant remained as a
VA employee. He was suspended for
some time, but eventually was brought
back to work while the charge was still
pending. Imagine if this individual had
been caring for children.
This case illustrates the length of
time the judicial process can take and,
regrettably, the need to remove the
manager’s discretion in these situa-
tions.
Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker. This
motion does not presuppose the guilt of
anyone who is charged with one of
these crimes; rather, it acknowledges,
like we all did with Ms. SHERRILL’s
amendment, that we have an obliga-
tion to ensure the safety and the well-
being of children who will be cared for
under this program.
Congress creates and oversees Fed-
eral agencies and the rules by which
they and their employees operate. Just
as Congress created existing guidelines
giving agencies the discretion to deny
employment for convicted or charged
sex offenders, so, too, can Congress re-
move that discretion.
b 1115
I am not willing to gamble with the
safety of my own children, nor am I
willing to gamble with the safety of
our veterans’ children either.
Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, any
Member here today who votes against
this motion to recommit is voting to
potentially expose children to the care
of an individual who has been charged
with a serious crime, including a sex
crime against a child.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues for
their support of this commonsense mo-
tion to protect the children of the men
and women who have bravely served in
uniform.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I claim
the time in opposition to the motion to
recommit.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California is recognized
for 5 minutes.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield to
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
LAMB), who was a former criminal
prosecutor before he arrived in Con-
gress.
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, the under-
lying bill here was made in regular
order, and many amendments were
considered, including the amendment
we just voted on. It is an amendment
that does keep children safe. In fact,
the way to make a mistake here and
ensure that the safety of our children
is in jeopardy would be to defeat this
underlying bill.
This underlying bill does what we
were sent here to do. It takes an excel-
lent government program which pro-
vides childcare to tens of thousands of
veterans and their families. It takes a
program that works and says we are
going to double down when the Vet-
erans Administration does the right
thing and people are satisfied; we will
continue that program.
Instead, our colleagues on the other
side of the aisle want to interrupt a
great program, and when they could
have made an amendment yesterday or
when they could introduce new legisla-
tion, they want to sideline this suc-
cessful program that takes care of chil-
dren.
We had one veteran tell us that this
was the best benefit they had been ex-
tended in exchange for their service
since 1992 and that their child loves the
childcare program at the VA, loves the
children that they are included with
and the people who watch over them
while their parent can get treatment.
There are tens of thousands of people
out there like them.
Mr. Speaker, the motto of the Vet-
erans Administration came from Presi-
dent Lincoln himself. He dared us to
strive on, to finish the work we are in,
to care for him who shall have borne
the battle and for his widow and his or-
phan—in other words, to take care of
the entire family.
This is about family, and through the
amendment process, we have made sure
that no one will provide childcare to
these children who is in serious trou-
ble. We are doing our job. We will con-
tinue to strive on. There is no reason
to get in the way of this excellent bill.
Mr. Speaker, I have learned a lot in
my past year of being here. One impor-
tant thing that I have learned is that
we can always update the references we
have made. I have quoted President
Lincoln, but my colleague from New
York (Mr. JEFFRIES) is also fond of
making more contemporary references.
There is one that occurred to me
today as I thought about the message
of this bill. As the Pittsburgh Pirates
were racing toward the World Series in
1979, they adopted as their slogan the
words of the disco stars Sister Sledge:
‘‘We are family.’’
Mr. Speaker, that is what this bill is
about. We are family. We will take care
of the veterans, and we will take care
of their children. We are family. Now
get up everybody and vote against this
MTR and for the underlying bill.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time.
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I have a par-
liamentary inquiry.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry.
Mr. BARR. The gentleman from
Pennsylvania indicated that the effect
of this motion to recommit would kill
this bill. We would like a ruling on
that, that the motion to recommit
would not kill the bill, that it would
send the bill back to committee to rec-
tify this problem that jeopardizes the
safety and well-being of the children of
our veterans.
Is that true, Mr. Speaker?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. If adopt-
ed, the effect of the motion will be that
the amendment is reported by the
chair of the committee and is imme-
diately before the House.
Mr. BARR. I thank the Chair for the
clarification, Mr. Speaker.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit.
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion to recommit.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the noes appeared to have it.
RECORDED VOTE
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I demand a
recorded vote.
A recorded vote was ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair
will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum
time for any electronic vote on the
question of passage.
This is a 5-minute vote.
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—ayes 200, noes 214,

AUTHORIZING THE CLERK TO
MAKE CORRECTIONS IN EN-
GROSSMENT OF H.R. 840, VET-
ERANS’ ACCESS TO CHILD CARE
ACT
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that, in the en-
grossment of H.R. 840, the Clerk be au-
thorized to correct section numbers,
punctuation, spelling, and cross-ref-
erences, and to make such other tech-
nical and conforming changes as may
be necessary to reflect the actions of
the House in amending the bill, includ-
ing the changes now at the desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the changes.
The Clerk read as follows:
In the amendment offered by Mrs.
Radewagen of American Samoa,
modify the first amendatory instruction to
read ‘‘Page 1, line 15’’;
modify the second amendatory instruction
to read ‘‘Page 2, after line 24’’; and
modify the third amendatory instruction
to read ‘‘Page 2, line 25’’.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
f
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 962,
BORN-ALIVE ABORTION SUR-
VIVORS PROTECTION ACT
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged
from further consideration of my bill,
H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Sur-
vivors Protection Act, and ask for its
immediate consideration in the House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman is advised that, under guide-
lines consistently issued by successive
Speakers, as recorded in section 956 of
the House Rules and Manual, the Chair
is constrained not to entertain the re-
quest unless it has been cleared by the
bipartisan floor and committee leader-
ships.
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRIES
Mrs. WAGNER. A parliamentary in-
quiry, Mr. Speaker.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman will state her parliamentary
inquiry.
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I under-
stand the guidelines the Chair just
cited. However, seeing no objection
from leadership or committee members
on either side of the aisle, does that
constitute clearance and allow the
Chair to entertain my motion under
the rules of the House?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As pre-
viously stated, the request cannot be
entertained absent appropriate clear-
ance.
Mrs. WAGNER. Further parliamen-
tary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman will state her parliamentary
inquiry.
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, again,
seeing no objection on either side of
the aisle, can the Chair advise what is
required pursuant to section 956 of the
House rules to allow my motion for dis-
charge of the Born-Alive Act to be con-
sidered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman is advised that a unanimous
consent request for the consideration
of that measure would have to receive
clearance from the majority and the
minority floor and committee leader-
ships.
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, can the
ruling of the Chair be challenged?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair has not issued a ruling.
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I ask
the Chair to rule on the motion of
unanimous consent.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has sought unanimous con-
sent and has not been recognized for
that purpose.
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, if this
unanimous consent request cannot be
entertained, I urge the Speaker and the
majority leader to schedule the Born-
Alive Act on the floor immediately so
we can stand up and defend the sanc-
tity of life.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman is engaging in debate and
has not been recognized for debate.
Mrs. WAGNER. This bill, Mr. Speak-
er, does not impose any restrictions.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman will suspend. The gentle-
woman is engaging in debate.

ELECTING MEMBERS TO A CER-
TAIN STANDING COMMITTEE OF
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTA-
TIVES
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, by direc-
tion of the House Republican Con-
ference, I send to the desk a privileged

The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows:

bers be, and are hereby, elected to the fol-
lowing standing committee of the House of

objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Wyoming?
There was no objection.
The resolution was agreed to.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.
f
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I rise
for the purpose of inquiring of the ma-
jority leader the schedule for the week
to come.
Madam Speaker, before I yield to the
gentleman from Maryland, I want to
share and join in with him in the trib-
ute that has been paid to our former
colleague John Dingell.
I served proudly on the House Energy
and Commerce Committee with Chair-
man Dingell, and what a giant, what a
true institutionalist of this House, the
longest serving Member, a colleague of
whom we will have fond memories and
will share those fond memories, I am
sure, in the days and weeks to come.
I know, Madam Speaker, and to my
colleague from Maryland as well, every
time we go into that room, the com-
mittee room for the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, we always get to
look up now and know that it is named
after our colleague John Dingell and
always remember his wit—because he
was tough, but he had a great wit to
share along with the combat that you
would always get to engage in with
him.
I will always remember, when the
vote was finally called, he always had
his own unique way. As the clerk would
be calling the roll of the committee
and they would call a member and the
member would say ‘‘aye’’ or ‘‘nay,’’ he
would always say: ‘‘Dingell votes aye.’’
He would have his unique way of ad-
dressing the issue of the day, and we
will always remember him. To his wife,
DEBBIE, and his family, we keep him in
our prayers.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER).
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I
thank my friend Mr. SCALISE, the Re-
publican whip, for his comments. It is
a testimony to the love and respect
that John Dingell enjoyed in this
House from both sides of the aisle.
As I said earlier, Madam Speaker,
there is no one in this House who
doesn’t have a particular story about
John Dingell. So, before we begin this
colloquy, I want to again express my
gratitude for the life and service of my
friend John Dingell.
Madam Speaker, I was with him
Wednesday. He died yesterday. I was
with him the day before he died. We sat
together for 21⁄2 hours and talked. As I
left, I leaned down and I kissed him on
the forehead, and I said: ‘‘I love you,
John.’’
I think I was speaking for, literally,
scores of Members who worked with
him on the committee, who worked
with him on the floor, and who saw
him in various different venues as a
colleague.
b 1145
They loved him as well for his integ-
rity and for his fairness. And, yes, as
the gentleman from Louisiana said, he
could be tough, and he could be rough,
but he also could be gentle and accept-
ing and open.
All of us in this country were blessed
by his time on this Earth, so much of

HOUSE
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1483
February 8, 2019
which he gave back to the rest of us in
the form of service in the Armed
Forces and in this House and in his
community.
History will remember him as its
longest serving Member of the House of
Representatives, but we who knew him
well remember John Dingell as a man
of extraordinary character, intellect,
courage, and purpose.
From healthcare to the environment,
from workers’ rights to veterans’ care,
John worked tirelessly over six decades
in the House to make sure Congress
was doing right by the people who the
House represents. His legislative record
of achievement speaks volumes about
who it was he believed he was fighting
for every day in office.
Medicare, Civil Rights Act, Voting
Rights Act, Clean Air Act, Safe Drink-
ing Water Act, Endangered Species
Act, all of these bore his imprint. What
an extraordinary record of service and
accomplishment. And that is because
he was a champion of affordable
healthcare, equality under the law, the
right to vote, economic opportunity,
and a healthy future for our children
and grandchildren.
To his beloved Michigan, he was an
indefatigable defender of autoworkers
and their role in the American econ-
omy.
John was steadfast in his belief that
the best way to serve them and all his
constituents was to work, whenever
possible, in concert with those across
the aisle and not against them.
We are, after all, all Americans. We
serve Americans. We serve a great
country. He believed in Congress, and,
oh, how he believed in his country. He
believed in sitting down together and
working through our differences in a
way that was respectful and civil.
Madam Speaker, I hope that spirit
and his example will imbue in us a re-
solve to find compromise in these chal-
lenging times. John, as everybody
knows, followed his father into serv-
ice—22 years of service.
In 1955, in December, his father
passed away, and John was sent by the
voters to continue the service of the
Dingell family. John Dingell, Sr., was a
major proponent of New Deal legisla-
tion in this House, serving from 1933 to
1955.
John was followed in service here by
the ‘‘lovely DEBORAH,’’ as he so affec-
tionately and lovingly called her. His
wife is an extraordinary Member of
Congress herself, and we are blessed to
have her. DEBBIE is an extraordinary
woman, an outstanding Member of the
Congress of the United States.
We stood in a moment of silence just
a few minutes ago. I hope that we will
adjourn in his honor today.
DEBBIE has been carrying on the Din-
gell legacy of seeking bipartisan re-
sults while remaining steadfast to the
progressive values that brought her
into public service.
I offer, Madam Speaker, my condo-
lences, as I do to John’s children and
grandchildren and to their entire ex-
tended family.
I thank the minority whip for his
comments and expression, which dem-
onstrates what we have all said. John
Dingell was, of course, a Democrat, but
John Dingell was more than that, by
far. He was an American and a fierce
promoter of the people’s House and the
work that was done by all the Members
of the people’s House, so I thank my
friend.
Madam Speaker, on Monday, the
House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning-
hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative
business, with votes postponed until
6:30 p.m.
On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thurs-
day, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for
morning-hour debate and 12 p.m. for
legislative business.
On Friday, the House will meet at 9
a.m. for legislative business, with last
votes expected no later than 3 p.m.
We will consider several bills under
suspension of the rules. A complete list
of suspensions will be available by the
close of business today.
The House will also consider H.J.
Res. 37, a war powers resolution on U.S.
involvement in Yemen. This legislation
will force a much-needed conversation
about how to bring to an end the vio-
lence and the humanitarian crisis that
we see in Yemen.
In addition, Madam Speaker, the
House is expected to consider the con-
ference report that finishes fiscal year
2019 appropriations. I understand that
progress is being made, and I am hope-
ful—I am hopeful—and optimistic that
we can have a deal that comes together
early next week. Members are advised
that additional legislative items are
possible.
Let me simply say that Members
ought to know that there is a possi-
bility as well, given the death of our
colleague, John Dingell, and the desire
of so many to attend his funeral, that
the schedule may be modified to ac-
commodate that effort and that travel
to Michigan.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for going through
the schedule, and I would share that
assessment as well, that if those ar-
rangements are made early next week,
I would expect a large contingent of
our colleagues to want to be there. We
will all be there in spirit with John and
his memory, as well as our wishes to
his family.
As he and I may have disagreed on
some issues, he was a strong supporter
of the Second Amendment, and we
would talk about that. Mostly, when I
had those conversations with Chairman
Dingell, it was about this great institu-
tion, this people’s House that we both
have the honor to serve in, and his ap-
preciation for what this institution
means to our great Nation. Those will
be memories I will always cherish.
As we look to the schedule, I know
the gentleman alluded to the con-
ference committee that is meeting. I
am encouraged, as I talk to different
conferees, by the conversations, the
issues that they are tackling. Clearly,
the issue that has been at the front and
center of the differences that we are
trying to work through deals with bor-
der security.
As we look to resolve the differences,
ultimately, it is my hope that we find
a way to properly fund the tools that
are needed to actually secure the bor-
der, as our experts, our men and
women who risk their lives to keep our
border safe, have laid out in detail: ob-
viously, technology to help them do
their jobs better, the need to increase
security at ports of entry and to have
more of the drug-testing equipment
that can do a better job of keeping
drugs out of our country.
Clearly, part of that solution has to
be some form of physical barriers—
whatever you want to call them, wall,
physical barrier—along areas where we
have the worst problems.
If I can bring to the gentleman’s at-
tention, there was a story yesterday in
the Washington Examiner titled, ‘‘Bor-
der agents just apprehended convicted
child molesters and an MS–13 member
at the Texas border where there’s no
barrier.’’ This is a Washington Exam-
iner article from yesterday, and I in-
clude it in the RECORD.
[From the Washington Examiner, Feb. 7,
2019]
BORDER AGENTS JUST APPREHENDED CON-
VICTED CHILD MOLESTERS AND AN MS–13
MEMBER AT THE TEXAS BORDER WHERE
THERE’S NO BARRIER
(By Eddie Scarry)
U.S. Border Patrol agents said Thursday
that they apprehended several illegal immi-
grants at the southern border in Texas, in
places where there are no physical barrier
walls to deter illegal crossings.
Among those caught crossing into the U.S.
were a Mexican man with a previous convic-
tion in Georgia for child molestation, a Hon-
duran man with a record in North Carolina
showing a conviction for ‘‘Indecent Liberties
with Child,’’ and another Honduran male
with a Florida record that identified him as
a member of the violent M–13 gang.
The apprehensions occurred in the Rio
Grande Valley sector of the southern border
on Monday and Tuesday, according to a re-
lease by the Border Patrol.
I toured a portion of that sector in Janu-
ary, and agents said that areas that feature
a 25-foot barrier of concrete and steel have
proven critical in blocking illegal border
crossers, forcing them to attempt their
crossings in specific areas where they can be
apprehended. They’ve asked for more of the
same kind of border wall to fill in the long
gaps that current exist.
When President Trump said during his
State of the Union address Tuesday that his
proposal is for new barrier that ‘‘will be de-
ployed in the areas identified by the border
agents as having the greatest need,’’ this is
what he meant.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, for
my friend, the majority leader, I want
to read this comment and ask a ques-
tion about this.
Among the other things that they
were able to identify as they were able
to stop, just earlier this week, some of
these people coming in, a person with
‘‘a previous conviction in Georgia for
child molestation, a Honduran man
with a record in North Carolina show-
ing a conviction for ‘indecent liberties

with a child,’ and another Honduran
male with a Florida record that identi-
fied him as a member of the violent
MS–13 gang.’’
This is just one more example, ear-
lier this week, of people who are com-
ing across our border illegally in
areas—and the article notes that this
happened in the Rio Grande Valley sec-
tor of the southern border on Monday
and Tuesday, according to our Border
Patrol agents, in areas where there is
no physical barrier.
So as the gentleman himself has said
just a few days ago, and I quote, ‘‘phys-
ical barriers are part of the solution’’
to improve border security, I would ask
the gentleman, when we get this con-
ference report hopefully wrapped up
this weekend, can the gentleman give
an assurance that there will be money
to properly not only secure the border
but to include the physical barriers
that are not there in those areas where
we have child molesters and gang mem-
bers coming across our southern bor-
der?
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for his question. I
am not a member of the conference
committee.
He quoted me in what I said. We are
for border security. I am hopeful that
the conference committee reports out a
bill that all sides can support that
does, in fact, try to make our borders
more secure. I look forward to having
that bill, hopefully, on the floor next
week prior to the 15th or on the 15th,
so we can: A, ensure that the govern-
ment is not shut down; and, B, ensure
that we have a bipartisan agreement
on how we can make our borders more
secure.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman, and I think we
are all going to be encouraging those
members of the conference committee
to continue the work that they are
doing. That headway seems to be going
in the right direction.
Hopefully, we come up with a bill by
early next week that we can vote on
next week before we get to the deadline
on the 15th to continue to properly
fund those other areas of the govern-
ment that haven’t been funded. That
includes the border security that is
necessary, including physical barriers.
Shifting gears, I would ask the gen-
tleman about a piece of legislation
that we filed that we have been trying
to get unanimous consent to bring up,
and this is H.R. 962, a bill by my col-
league, ANN WAGNER from Missouri.
As we saw earlier, in these last few
days, you had the Governor of New
York signing legislation that, among
other things, would allow for a baby
that comes out of the womb alive,
whether it is from an abortion that
wasn’t successful—whatever the case,
if a baby comes out of the womb alive,
the fact that in the State of New York,
and now we saw the Governor of Vir-
ginia talking on a radio show about
how that process and procedure would
be carried out where the baby, after it
is born alive, can be killed legally in
those States.
As we talk about the sanctity of in-
nocent life, clearly, there are many dif-
ferent divisions amongst the parties on
the issue of abortion. But to many, this
issue transcends abortion. This isn’t
related to abortion anymore. If a baby
comes out of the womb and is alive, the
fact that in only 26 States there are
protections that that baby can’t be
killed, that means in nearly half of the
States in this country, that baby still
can be killed legally.
I still don’t completely grasp how
that is legal in America, that someone
who is born alive can still be killed and
have that be legal in certain States.
So we have a bill called the Born-
Alive Protection Act that would ensure
that, regardless of how you feel about
abortion—pro-life, pro-choice—after
the baby comes out of the womb alive,
it shouldn’t be able to be killed. H.R.
962 gives that protection that it can’t
be killed. I would ask the gentleman if
he would allow that bill to come to the
House floor for a vote.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for the question.
As the gentleman knows, this bill was
introduced in the last Congress in
which the Republicans, his party, were
in charge of the House and the Senate
and the Presidency, and it did not pass
the Congress and go to the President.
We will pursue the regular order.
This bill, like every other bill, will be
referred to committee, and the com-
mittee will handle its consideration as
the committee sees fit.
The gentleman has talked about, or
there has been discussion about, a dis-
charge petition that is obviously avail-
able. We were trying very hard to have
people we call Dreamers allowed to
stay in the only country they know.
Unfortunately, the leadership was
against that discharge petition, and it
never got to the floor.
For many bills that either side may
want, some come to the floor, some
don’t. But this will go through the reg-
ular process, and it is going to be re-
ferred to the committee of jurisdiction.
We will see how that proceeds.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I
would remind the gentleman that when
we did bring that piece of legislation
last year, the Born-Alive Protection
Act, it did pass the House, 241–183, in a
bipartisan way, with six Democrats
voting with us to pass that bill to the
Senate. It did not get passed in the
Senate.
b 1200
However, as you look now, there have
been a number of alarming develop-
ments that have raised the profile of
this issue.
When the Governor of New York
signed into law his legislation and cele-
brated the fact that, in his State, you
can kill a baby after it has been born,
and you saw applause in the legislature
over that, it shocked people across the
country. It horrified and angered peo-
ple across the country.
When the Governor of Virginia, just a
few days ago, went to a radio station
and described, in detail, how a baby
born alive can still be killed, can be
killed after it is born alive, and it is
legal in that State, it is legal, and not
protected in nearly a majority of our
States, this issue has come to the fore-
front of Americans.
Again, pro-life, pro-choice, wherever
you are on this issue, the vast majority
of Americans feel strongly that you
should not be able to kill the baby
after it is born alive.
So we can talk about a long, drawn-
out legislative process, but now there
is more interest and more anger to con-
front this violent act of murder. How
can it be anything other than murder
to kill a child after it comes out of the
womb? So I know we can talk about a
long, drawn-out procedure.
I have made it very clear I will be fil-
ing a discharge petition if we can’t get
to the point where we get this bill
brought to the floor in a quicker way.
There is a quicker way to do this and
address this problem.
Again, if you ask most pro-choice
people in America, they don’t think it
is right that you can kill the baby
after it comes out of the womb. And so,
as the gentleman can talk about a reg-
ular order procedure, this bill has
passed the House before, and now there
is more interest in the Senate to con-
front this issue. We have the ability to
give them that opportunity.
I would just ask if the gentleman
would reconsider, to move this in a
quicker way and allow the unanimous
consent motion to go through. If no
one objects, we can bring that bill to
the floor. And so far, as we have been
making the motion for unanimous con-
sent, there has been no opposition ex-
pressed. They have just not allowed the
motion to go forward and be recog-
nized.
So I would just ask the gentleman to
reconsider and allow us to, at least,
have that opportunity to try to bring
this bill to the floor in the quickest
way possible, to stop this barbaric
process from being allowed anywhere
in America.
Mr. HOYER. My answer, however, is
the same to the gentleman, Madam
Speaker. We have a process. The bill
has just been introduced. It will be re-
ferred to committee, and the com-
mittee will have it under regular order
to consider. I cannot predict what the
committee will do with that bill, but I
understand the gentleman’s strong
feelings. I respect those; and I respect
the fact that this is an issue that is
current.
But, again, my answer to the distin-
guished Republican Whip is that we
will be considering that in the regular
order and, at that point in time, I am
sure that he will be able to testify be-
fore the committee, if and when there

is a hearing, and that others will as
well, including the sponsor. But we are
going to pursue the regular order on
this bill and other bills as well.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for those com-
ments. I would just ask if the gen-
tleman would urge the chairman of the
Judiciary Committee to move swiftly
to bring this bill up for a vote as we
continue to use every legislative tool
we have available to, hopefully, try to
get a unanimous consent agreement to
bring the bill to the floor. But ulti-
mately, if that is not allowed, and if
the committee process doesn’t work
and actually take attention to this in a
quick way, then we will go a different
route and use the discharge petition
route.
So we have continued to try to make
the point that this issue needs to be ad-
dressed by this Congress. The Presi-
dent, in his State of the Union Tuesday
night, was very clear that Congress
ought to address this issue. And the
President, in his speech—and I thought
it was an incredibly eloquent speech,
confronting the challenges we face, but
also talking about the greatness of this
country and highlighting some of the
people who achieved greatness, the
three men who stormed the beaches of
Normandy, and the challenges they
faced to liberate Europe, to keep Amer-
ica free.
Ultimately, one of those gentlemen
actually went on to help liberate Da-
chau; and to see the Holocaust survivor
who was at Dachau, and liberated by
that very gentleman, to both be on the
same row of the gallery, was a special
moment, a special moment that re-
minds us of the greatness of this coun-
try.
And as the President talked about
that at the end, he challenged us, he
challenged Congress to reach for great-
ness, not gridlock, but for that same
greatness as we confront the challenges
that this great Nation faces today.
This action, the fact that, in many
States of this Nation, it is allowed to
kill a baby after it has been born, is a
moral wrong that we need to fix. That
is another act of greatness that we
need to rise up to; and I hope we do in
the quickest way possible.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

ADJOURNMENT TO MONDAY,
FEBRUARY 11, 2019
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that when the
House adjourns today, it adjourn to
meet on Monday next, when it shall
convene at noon for morning-hour de-
bate and 2 p.m. for legislative business.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
FINKENAUER). Is there objection to the
request of the gentleman from Mary-
land?
There was no objection.
HONORING THE LIFE OF THE HON-
ORABLE JOHN DAVID DINGELL,
JR.
(Ms. SHALALA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, my
first friend and mentor in Washington
was Chairman Dingell. Big John guided
me during all of my years as HHS Sec-
retary. He was a towering figure in the
House, passionate about healthcare,
and tough on unethical behavior by
those who benefited from the gen-
erosity of taxpayers.
He was, for all of us who knew and
loved him, gentle and kind, and gen-
erous with his time and advice. He was
a gentleman legislator, brilliant,
tough, strategic, and extraordinarily
effective. He was a patriot.
My heart goes out to my good friend,
his wife, DEBBIE, and his family.

HONORING THE LIFE OF OSSIE
MILLS
(Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor
the life of Ossie Mills from Tulsa, Okla-
homa. Those who knew Mr. Mills best
say that he was a loyal friend, a hard
worker, a devoted husband and father,
and a servant of God. Mr. Mills encour-
aged and challenged others to live out
their full potential.
Mr. Mills served as an executive vice
president at Oral Roberts University
from 2011 to 2018, where he served as
executive director and global council
member of Empowered21. He also
served on the Board of Directors for
Convoy of Hope, a worldwide, faith-
based organization aimed at empow-
ering others to live lives free of pov-
erty, disease, and hunger.
Most recently, Mr. Mills was the
president and CEO tvChaz, a faith-
based streaming platform aimed at
helping people discover God’s vision for
life.
While Ossie Mills’ time on Earth has
come to an end, the impact of his work
will last for years to come.
Mr. Mills is survived by his loving
wife, Bonnie, and his three children,
Nick, Olivia, and Alex.

THE NATIONAL PRAYER
BREAKFAST
(Mr. MARSHALL asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Speaker,
Kansas has deep roots in the creation
of the National Prayer Breakfast.
President Eisenhower, who grew up
near my hometown, in Abilene, Kansas,
was the first President to join Members
in their informal prayer event in 1953.
Since that year, it has been honored as
a nationally recognized event and, to
this day, every President since Ike has
attended.
This week, I had the great honor to
attend the 67th Annual National Pray-
er Breakfast, where we gathered to ask
God for wisdom, discernment, and
strength, as well as how to lead this
great Nation.
This country has always looked to
God in times of need and will continue
to do so. And now, more than ever, it is
important to pray for a united Nation.
I was reminded this week of the
scripture from 1 Timothy that requires
us to all pray for our kings and those
in authority. But what I had forgotten
was that there was a promise that
came along with that request; that we
live peaceful and quiet lives in all God-
liness and holiness.

END INFANTICIDE
(Mr. GREEN of Tennessee asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam
Speaker, like many Americans, chills
ran through my spine when I heard
Governor Northam casually endorse
killing a baby after it was born. It has
been over a week since those com-
ments, and I ask, Why are our Demo-
crat colleagues still silent?
Killing a baby, once born, is infan-
ticide, pure and simple.
It is 2019, and we live in the most ad-
vanced country in the world. Surely,
every Member of this body can agree
that, at the very least, babies, once
born, should be protected.
That is why I come to the floor today
to urge Speaker PELOSI to allow a vote
on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors
Protection Act, a bill that would re-
quire medical care for infants born
alive during an abortion procedure.
I urge my colleagues across the aisle
to join us to end infanticide.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DICK
AMES
(Mr. EMMER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to remember the life of Dick
Ames, a great friend who recently
passed. Dick’s contributions to the
great State of Minnesota are countless.
His impact on our progress and the fu-
ture of our great State is unending. I
was lucky to know Dick and the gen-
erous heart he had for others, for ev-
eryone in our community.
Over the course of his life, he helped
shape everything he touched. Through
his business, Ames Construction, or his
farm, or even his contributions to the
athletic department at his beloved Uni-
versity of Minnesota, Dick made a dif-
ference for our great State.
His hard work, honesty, and integrity
were an example for us all, to strive for
greatness and serve those around you

THE SAUCE BOSS
(Mr. OLSON asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, back
home in Texas 22, a new source of eco-
nomic growth is exploding in Sienna
Plantation and Missouri City. This
force of prosperity is the Sauce Boss.
The Sauce Boss is a walking, talking,
sauce-making American Dream. Her
name is Tyla-Simone Crayton.
Tyla is 15 years young, a sophomore
Panther at Ridge Point High School.
Tyla started Sienna Wings because
Tyla just loves eating. One sauce has
now become three: Tangy, Spicy, and
Lemon Pepper.
Tyla has just one employee, her
mom, Monique. She also has 22 dis-
tributors and a box packer who is pack-
ing more boxes now than they have
packed before.
Tyla, Monique, Panther Nation, and
all of Texas 22 have a common dream:
We can’t wait until Sienna Wings are
on the shelves of HEB.
And that’s just the way it is.

HONORING DR. ROBERT PACKARD
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. FLORES) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority
leader.
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Dr. Robert Packard of
Waco, Texas, who passed away on Jan-
uary 5, 2019.
Robert Packard was born on August
13, 1924, in Regina, New Mexico. When
he was 2 years old, his family moved to
Temple, Texas, where he graduated
from high school in 1943.
After graduation, Robert enlisted in
the United States Army, where he
served in the Combat Engineers and
the Army Specialized Training Pro-
gram before being assigned to the Pa-
cific theater and the Signal Corps dur-
ing World War II.
After the war, Robert returned to
Texas, where he enrolled at the Univer-
sity of Texas at Austin. He would go on
to earn three degrees from the univer-
sity: a bachelor of science, a master of
arts, and a Ph.D., all in physics.
After working on national security,
defense-related research, and teaching
undergraduate classes at UT, he re-
ceived an invitation to become an asso-
ciate professor of physics at Baylor
University in 1952.
While at Baylor, he met and married
Joyce Hornaday, his wife of over 60
years. Joyce, who was the assistant
dean of women at Baylor at the time,
and Robert were set up on a blind date
by their students. They were married
April 15, 1954, on the Baylor campus.
Together, Robert and Joyce lived a life
full of love and adventure.
In the 1960s, Robert and Joyce lived
in Indonesia while Robert was teaching
with a medical team in Surabaya and
leading Sunday school classes at a
local mission.
Robert’s impact at Baylor cannot be
overstated. In addition to being the
physics department chair, Robert also
holds the record for being the longest
teaching professor. Teaching for al-
most 60 years, he is estimated to have
taught a quarter of Baylor alumni with
his famous ‘‘Packard Physics’’ class.
An icon in Baylor University, he was
designated as a master teacher in 1990,
the highest honor granted to faculty
members. He also received the W.R.
White Meritorious Award, the Leg-
endary Mentor Award, the Collins Out-
standing Professor Award, the Baylor
Alumni Retired Faculty Award, and a
Baylor University Alumnus by Choice.
In 1990, his longtime classroom was
renovated and renamed in his honor.
Robert’s impact went far beyond the
classroom. He sponsored many student
organizations, such as Taurus, Circle
K, Student Congress, and Kappa Omega
Tau. He served on the Student Life Ad-
visory Board, Baylor’s Athletic Coun-
cil, and was president of the Baylor
University Strecker Museum. In the
1980s, he sponsored the first ever colle-
giate chapter of Habitat for Humanity.
In 2003, he served as the grand marshal
of the Baylor Homecoming Parade.
Robert also selflessly gave back to
the greater Waco community. He
served two terms on the Economic Op-
portunities Advancement Corporation,
volunteered at the Historic Waco Foun-
dation’s McCulloch House and the Red
Cross, taught Sunday school classes at
Columbus Avenue Baptist Church, and
assisted the Waco Rotary Club.
Both he and Joyce were known for
their commitment to Baylor’s Mayborn
Museum, the Old Main Society, the
1845 Society, the Baylor Bear Founda-
tion, and the Baylor Tip-Off Club.
Robert received national recognition
for his teaching efforts and was named
as an Outstanding Educator of America
and an American Man of Science. His
talents and dedication were highly
sought after by the government and by
universities all across the globe, but
Robert turned them down, opting to
stay in Waco and at Baylor University.
Robert and Joyce loved Baylor stu-
dents as if they were their own family,
and they were proud to be a part of
that legacy.
Madam Speaker, Dr. Robert Pack-
ard’s life was defined by his service to
his family, to our country, and to the
world. He will be forever remembered
as a husband, a veteran, an educator of
thousands, a mentor, a selfless servant,
and a great friend.
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest
and heartfelt condolences to the Pack-
ard family. We also lift up the family
and friends of Dr. Robert Packard in
our prayers.
I have requested the United States
flag be flown over our Nation’s Capitol
to honor the life and legacy of Dr. Rob-
ert Packard.
Madam Speaker, as I close today, I
urge all Americans to continue to pray
for our country, for our veterans, for
our military men and women who pro-
tect us, and for our first responders
who keep us safe at home.
HONORING DR. HENRY DETHLOFF
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Dr. Henry Dethloff of
College Station, Texas, who passed
away on January 25, 2019.
Henry was born on August 10, 1934, in
New Orleans, Louisiana, to Carl and
Camelia Dethloff. He was raised in
Natchitoches and was deeply shaped by
Louisiana’s culture and geography.
As a boy, he grew up on Cane River
Lake and became a skilled swimmer
and angler. It is said that Henry was
one of the only people to swim the
width of the river completely under-
water. In 1952, he graduated from
Natchitoches High School, and he
moved to Texas.
In 1956, Henry graduated from the
University of Texas at Austin with a
bachelor of arts degree. He was then
commissioned as an officer in the
United States Navy, where he served
from 1956 to 1958.
After his service, he returned to Lou-
isiana to pursue a master’s degree at
Northwestern State University. While
there, he was introduced to Myrtle
Anne Elliot, who would become the
love of his life and longtime com-
panion. They married in 1961 and had
two sons.
In 1964, Henry received his Ph.D.
from the University of Missouri and
continued teaching as a history pro-
fessor at the University of Louisiana at
Lafayette.
In 1969, he joined the faculty at Texas
A&M University in College Station,
and he served as the history depart-
ment chairman from 1980 to 1985. Henry
became a professor emeritus of history
at Texas A&M and became well known
for his books covering a number of top-
ics. One of his most publicized works
documented the history of Texas A&M
for its centennial anniversary in 1976.
Madam Speaker, Henry Dethloff’s
life was defined by his service to his
family, to our country, and to Texas
A&M University. He will be forever re-
membered as a husband, a father, a
grandfather, and a great-grandfather, a
veteran, a mentor, a selfless servant,
and a friend.
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest
and heartfelt condolences to the
Dethloff family. We also lift up the
family and friends of Dr. Henry
Dethloff in our prayers.

HONORING CHARLES CARGILL
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Charles Cargill of
Bryan, Texas, who passed away on Jan-
uary 28, 2019.
Chuck was born in 1931 in Eddy,
Texas, to Maudie and Willie Cargill. He
attended Bruceville-Eddy primary
schools and graduated from Waco High
School before attending Texas A&M
University.
At Texas A&M, Chuck was a member
of the ‘‘B Air Force’’ in the Corps of
Cadets. During his sophomore year,
Chuck met Mary Hall on a double blind
date, although they were not paired to-
gether that night. The next morning,
Chuck called Mary to ask her on a
date. They quickly fell in love and were
married at the beginning of Chuck’s
senior year in 1952.
He graduated in May 1953 with a de-
gree in business administration and
was commissioned as a second lieuten-
ant in the United States Air Force.
Upon graduation, Chuck accepted a
position with Sears, Roebuck in Waco,
Texas. In 1954, he was called to Active
Duty and was assigned to Brookley Air
Force Base in Mobile, Alabama, as a
supply officer. Chuck concluded his Ac-
tive Duty in 1956 and returned to Sears,
Roebuck in Waco and was later trans-
ferred to Bryan, Texas.
Chuck eventually began working at
Texas A&M University. Chuck held
multiple positions at Texas A&M, in-
cluding director of the University Cen-
ter Complex, associate vice president
for business affairs, and vice president
of operations. While working at Texas
A&M, he also completed his master of
business administration degree.
Chuck continued to serve in the Air
Force Reserve for 35 years. He received
many accolades for his service, includ-
ing the Distinguished Service Medal,
the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious
Service Medal, the Air Force Out-
standing Unit Award Ribbon, the Na-
tional Defense Service Medal, the Air
Force Longevity Service Award Rib-
bon, and the Armed Forces Reserve
Medal. He retired at the rank of major
general.
Chuck served on many boards of or-
ganizations in the Brazos Valley, in-
cluding St. Joseph Hospital, the First
Baptist Church in Bryan, Bryan Hos-
pital, Texas A&M University United
Way, Bryan Chapter of Toastmasters
International, the Reserve Officers As-
sociation, the Aggieland Chapter of the
Air Force Association, the Texas A&M
Association of Former Students, and
the 12th Man Foundation.
Madam Speaker, Chuck’s life was de-
fined by his service to our country, to
his family, and to our Brazos Valley
community. He will be forever remem-
bered as a husband, a father, a grand-
father, a great-grandfather, a veteran,
a selfless servant, and a friend.
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest
and heartfelt condolences to the
Cargill family. We also lift up the fam-
ily and friends of Chuck in our prayers.
I have requested the United States
flag be flown over our Nation’s Capitol

HONORING DANNY BURKARD
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Danny Burkard of High-
land Village, Texas, who passed away
on January 19, 2019.
Danny was born on December 16, 1932,
in Dallas, Texas, to Edward Raymond
and Willie Mable Burkard. He was
raised on a farm near Rowlett, Texas,
and graduated from high school in 1950.
He later attended Texas A&M Univer-
sity, where he was a member of the
Corps of Cadets.
After graduation, Danny married
Mary Francis Irvin in 1954 and was
commissioned into the United States
Army, serving in the Signal Corps and
as an aviator.
Danny’s service took him around the
world. He was stationed across the
United States, Germany, South Korea,
and Greenland. He also served as a heli-
copter pilot during the Vietnam war.
During his time in the Army, Danny
continued his education at the U.S.
Army’s Command and General Staff
School and the Industrial College of
the Armed Forces at Fort McNair. He
also graduated from the University of
Georgia with a master of business ad-
ministration degree.
Danny rose to the rank of colonel
and worked in numerous aviation and
command positions before finishing his
career at the Office of Assistant Sec-
retary of the Army for Manpower and
Reserve Affairs.
After his 26 years of Active-Duty
service, Danny and Mary returned to
Texas and settled in Highland Village.
Danny was a devout Catholic and spent
more than 20 years following Christ’s
example, administering to men serving
prison sentences in Denton County. He
was also involved in his church’s neigh-
borhood committees, as well as invest-
ment, bridge, and poker clubs.
Madam Speaker, Danny Burkard’s
life was defined by his service to his
family, to our country, and to Jesus
Christ. He will be forever remembered
as a husband, a father, a grandfather, a
great-grandfather, a veteran, a mentor,
a selfless servant, and a friend.
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest
and heartfelt condolences to the
Burkard family. We also lift up the
family and friends of Danny Burkard in
our prayers.
I have requested the United States
flag be flown over our Nation’s Capitol
to honor the life and legacy of Danny
Burkard.
Madam Speaker, as I close today, I
urge all Americans to continue praying
for our country, for our veterans, for
our military men and women who pro-
tect us, and for our first responders
who keep us safe at home.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

ISSUES OF THE DAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. GOHMERT) is recognized for the re-
mainder of the hour.
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker,
may I inquire how much time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has approximately
47 minutes remaining.
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I
appreciate my dear friend and, actu-
ally, college friend for these many
years, since we were in school together
at Texas A&M, and the great tribute.
There was another superb tribute
today paid to a giant of a man in more
recent days. John Dingell had been re-
duced to a wheelchair, but having vis-
ited with him when his health was
great and when he was in his wheel-
chair, Madam Speaker, I can confirm
either way he was a giant of a man.
Now, make no mistake, we had some
significant political differences of opin-
ion, but I never, ever had to wonder
about the integrity, the honesty, just
the greatness of John Dingell. He shot
straight. Sometimes they were things
you didn’t want to hear.
I loved his mischievous sense of
humor, his way of making his point. I
had no problem with the way he some-
times went after witnesses that he felt
were being less than candid. He was a
great man. He was a great Member of
Congress.
One of the things that has brought
prior comments of his back to mind,
prior activity here, was the proposed
Green New Deal. I disagreed with John
Dingell’s effort for some type of gov-
ernment-run or universal-type health
insurance, but we both—and I know the
man’s heart. He wanted what he be-
lieved was best for the American peo-
ple.
He was a man that staunch conserv-
atives like me could talk to and could
trust. He, as was pointed out by the
majority leader earlier today and oth-
ers, loved the Energy and Commerce
Committee; and it was humorous, ear-
lier, when it was mentioned the times
when he thought that was the only
committee here.
But after decades and decades of
service and wanting to do something
about the problem with healthcare—it
certainly has problems. He was so look-
ing forward, as chairman of the Energy

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

and Commerce Committee, the com-
mittee of jurisdiction over such a
healthcare bill as the ACA,
ObamaCare, whatever you want to call
it, he was looking forward to shep-
herding that through as the great
chairman, as the great Member of Con-
gress that he was.
At the time—this was between 2007
and January of 2011 when Republicans
took back over the majority here in
the House—he had appropriately be-
come chairman of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee. He couldn’t wait to
shepherd through what he believed
would fix so many of the ills with the
healthcare system, health insurance
system.
And I would certainly agree that the
health insurance companies are not
really in the insurance business; they
are more in health management. I
would love to see them back in the in-
surance business instead of the man-
agement, where we either have the gov-
ernment or the insurance companies
telling us what healthcare we can have
and not have.
But John Dingell wanted what was
best for the American people. And
Speaker PELOSI made it very clear,
there were two important bills that she
wanted coming out of the Energy and
Commerce Committee, and one of them
was a healthcare bill. If you are a Dem-
ocrat, you should have wanted John
Dingell to be chairman of the com-
mittee that would bring that out of
committee and to the floor.
But the other bill was given the
name cap and trade, and the cap-and-
trade bill included a carbon tax. It was
an early form of a Green New Deal. It
was going to get us off of any carbon-
based energy—or make it very expen-
sive to be on it. That appears to be a
big purpose of the Green New Deal.
But earlier this week in our Natural
Resources Committee, we had testi-
mony regarding this Green New Deal
issue, and there was a very sharp Afri-
can American witness who made the
point of something I understood he
called energy poverty.
It was something that John Dingell
had made the point about that got him
fired by Speaker PELOSI as chairman of
the Energy and Commerce Committee.
Because John Dingell knew, when you
run up the cost of energy, of elec-
tricity, of gasoline, of the things that
people need to get to and from work or
to and from healthcare or to and from
important meetings, you run up the
cost of that.
As one lower middle-class single
mom told me back some years ago
when the Obama administration had
helped to run the price of gasoline
through the roof, run up energy costs—
in fairness, candidate Obama had prom-
ised, like with coal-based energy, he
wasn’t going to just necessarily make
it illegal, but he would skyrocket the
cost of that energy. So, in fairness, he
was keeping a promise. He was sky-
rocketing the cost of energy.
And this single mom was desperate.
She said: I can’t afford the gasoline to
get to work, and I am maxed out on my
credit card. I can’t get another one.
And I have to pay just enough on my
credit card so I can get gas on it so I
can keep going to work. But the prices
keep going up. I don’t have room on
the only credit card I have got to get
gas so I can keep my job, and now I
may be in danger of losing the job that
allows me to pay a little bit on my
credit card so I can get gas the next
month and keep my job.
I mean, it was tragic to listen to
somebody struggling, for all they were
worth, to take care of themselves,
their kids, and the government was in-
tentionally running up the cost of fuel
and electricity.
I mentioned before, one 80-year-old
lady in east Texas had commented: I
am afraid that, with the way the cost
of energy is going up, I am not going to
be able to afford anything, not even
propane, electricity.
She said: I was born in a home that
only had a wood-burning stove, and I
am afraid I may leave this world in a
home that only has a wood-burning
stove for energy.
And I said: I hate to be the bearer of
bad news, but this administration, the
Obama administration, is trying to
make it so you can’t have a wood-burn-
ing stove in your room because that
will violate emission laws they want.
So you can end up actually worse off
than the home in which you were born.
Well, thankfully, that administration
is no longer in office to continue driv-
ing up the cost of energy. But let’s face
it, when the cost of gasoline goes up,
jet fuel goes up. When the cost of elec-
tricity goes up, it doesn’t hurt the rich.
It hurts the middle class tremendously,
and it hurts the lower middle class and
the poor even more.
And my understanding of what was
considered the final straw that caused
the Speaker to fire John Dingell as
chairman of the committee that he
loved dearly and fire him from the
chance to shepherd through a
healthcare bill was when he said—and
as I recall, these are his exact words—
talking about cap and trade: That bill
is not only a tax, it is a great big one.
And he made clear he knew that, if
cap and trade passed, electricity would
skyrocket, the cost of gasoline would
skyrocket, every cost of energy would
skyrocket.
The rich would be fine. All of those
rich Democrats, some rich Repub-
licans, fly around in their private jet,
have two or three Suburbans. Al Gore
would have more than one, with the en-
gines running while he went and gave a
speech or made an appearance.
Those kinds of folks, they wouldn’t
be hurt. They get to keep having their
big, energy-guzzling Suburbans run-
ning even though they weren’t in them.
They would be able to keep flying their
private planes. But the Nation’s poor
would be devastated if cap and trade
had become the law.
But because John Dingell could see
the damage that was going to do to the
Nation’s poor, he said: I can’t, in good
conscience, bring that bill, get it voted
out of my committee.
So he got fired. He got fired from the
chance to do what he had dreamed
about doing for decades, and that was
having a big healthcare bill that he be-
lieved would fix so many of the prob-
lems that especially the Nation’s poor
were facing.
Now, the irony was apparently not
lost on John Dingell when we were hav-
ing the last hour of debate on the
healthcare bill that he had been pre-
vented from shepherding through. He
was put in the chair as Speaker pro
tempore to preside over the last hour
of debate on the healthcare bill before
we voted on it.
He had long since been replaced as
chairman of the Energy and Commerce
Committee by Henry Waxman, who fa-
mously said to Republicans: We not
only don’t want your input, we don’t
need your votes.
That was the new chairman’s ap-
proach, and it was the way he pushed
the unaffordable ACA through. It was
the way he pushed through cap and
trade out of committee that would
have been such a horrible blow to our
Nation’s core.
But he had been fired from the
chance to get a better bill as chairman
of the committee, and yet he got put in
the chair as Speaker pro tempore to
preside over the last hour of debate be-
fore the vote. I found that rather iron-
ic.
b 1245
Mr. Speaker, I talked to the former
Republican chairman of Energy and
Commerce, Joe Barton, who said, long
after ObamaCare had passed and we
were finding out that the architect of
ObamaCare knew it wouldn’t work,
knew that when the President said: If
you like your doctor, you can keep
your doctor. If you like your insurance,
you can keep your insurance, the ar-
chitect of that for the Obama adminis-
tration said he knew all of that was not
true, but they had to say those things
to sell it.
But Joe Barton pointed out that
John Dingell was such an amazing
chairman of Energy and Commerce and
was so adept at forging together bills,
Joe told me that if John Dingell had
been left as chairman of Energy and
Commerce, he would have called us Re-
publicans in and he would have said:
Look, we are going to pass a healthcare
bill, and I would like your support. I
want it to be bipartisan. So give me a
few things that you have got to have in
a healthcare bill so that I can find
some way we can make this a bipar-
tisan healthcare bill and we can get at
least a bunch of your party’s votes so
this truly will be a bipartisan bill, and
that will make the bill a better bill.
As Joe pointed out to me, the thing
is, if they had left John Dingell in as
chairman of Energy and Commerce, he
would have forged together a bill. As
Joe said, it would have been a bill that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1489
February 8, 2019
some of us Republicans, if not all, we
would have had to vote for it because
some of the things he put in there that
we just agreed to strongly with, we
would have had to vote for it.
If John Dingell had been left chair-
man of Energy and Commerce, it would
not have been a bill that would have
cost the Democrats the majority in No-
vember of 2010. It would not have been
a bill that Republicans could run on in
2010 and 2012 and say, we have got to
completely repeal ObamaCare, the
ACA, whatever you want to call it.
We wouldn’t have been able to do
that, because the master at bringing
together parties and forging together a
good bill, he would have been the one
that brought it together and it would
have lasted. We wouldn’t have all been
running to repeal it because too many
of us voted for it.
So as we pause to honor a truly great
man today, John Dingell, I can’t imag-
ine somebody breaking his record of 59
years in the House—I am sure not
going to—but what an amazing man.
I recall that day—John Dingell was
at that point relying heavily on a cane,
that political congressional giant had
to rely on that cane very heavily to get
up to the Speaker’s chair. He had to
rely on it to come down out of the
Speaker’s chair that day that we voted
on the ACA, and the majority leader
appropriately called attention to the
great man he was, and that day every-
body rose in a standing ovation, and I
am forever glad that we did—the ma-
jority leader pointed out that this had
been a dream of John Dingell’s for dec-
ades, that he wanted a big healthcare
bill that would fix problems, and now
we were finally getting to vote on it.
So it was only appropriate that that
great man, that great legislator, John
Dingell, would sit in the Chair and pre-
side over the debate in that last hour.
So he asked unanimous consent that
we all show our appreciation, and that
is when we had the standing ovation.
But I was thinking I know this guy.
He is not only a righteous and honor-
able man of integrity, honest, he is
really, really smart. He is not stupid.
Anybody that ever tried to match wits
with him soon learned that they were
going to feel like an unarmed man in a
war of words. They tried to do combat
with words.
I just knew there is no way this bril-
liant man has lost the irony of getting
all this great praise and recognition as
he presides for an hour over debate
with really no control over what goes
in the bill during that hour when they
fired him from the chance to forge to-
gether a much better bill.
And it was that overwhelming sense
of irony—sometimes I should keep my
mouth shut when I don’t—but the ma-
jority leader had asked for that unani-
mous consent recognition which was
entirely in order, so I came over and
grabbed that microphone and when the
applause died down, I said: Mr. Speak-
er—to the Speaker pro tempore that
replaced John Dingell in the Chair—
and basically I said in that same sense
of love and admiration for a great pa-
triot, a great man, a great Congress-
man, something like that, I would ask
unanimous consent that we give him
his chairmanship back.
Anyway, it took a couple of seconds
or so for people on this side of the aisle
to realize the irony and just die laugh-
ing. And I know so many of the people
across the aisle, great people with
great senses of humor. We kid around,
joke around about things.
I was surprised nobody was laughing
across the aisle because they knew.
They liked Dingell. They knew that
Speaker PELOSI fired him because he
wouldn’t push through the cap-and-
trade bill that would have been so det-
rimental to the Nation’s poor. But they
weren’t laughing. I couldn’t believe
they were not laughing.
But I had one of the Capitol Police
tell me afterwards—actually, there
were two of them that came up when I
was leaving in the Speakers lobby, no-
body else out there—they said, I know
there weren’t people on the other side
of the aisle from you laughing at what
you said, but you should have been out
here in the Speaker’s lobby as they
left.
So many of them were saying: Wasn’t
that the funniest thing you ever heard?
I know, but did you see the Speaker
looking around for anybody that was
laughing? I couldn’t laugh. She was
looking toward me.
So anyway, it was an amazing mo-
ment. I thought it was not just ironic,
but humorous. The next day, John Din-
gell, who it was not easy for him to get
around at that time—it became even
tougher—but he had sought me out at
the back of the Republican side of the
floor here, and he said: LOUIE, I wanted
to thank you for what you said yester-
day.
I said: John, the irony, I just couldn’t
stay quiet. The irony overwhelmed me.
And he said: I know. That is why I
just wanted to say thank you.
Well, that is a thanks I will treasure
for the rest of my life. John Dingell
was a great man. He was a great legis-
lator, and one of the best committee
chairmen this Chamber has ever had in
any committee. I got to serve side by
side for 2 years on a subcommittee
with his wife, DEBBIE, now a widow,
and I came to find out that so much
that I liked about John Dingell existed
in DEBBIE.
She was the ranking member of that
subcommittee when I was chairman,
back when they let me have a chair-
manship on our side of the aisle, and I
loved working with her. I still do. She
is a treasured friend. She is a great
American, and she is hurting.
So for those who believe in the power
of prayer, I hope, Madam Speaker, that
they will remember all of John Din-
gell’s family and lift them up in prayer
for the peace that surpasses all under-
standing because we have lost a great
man to this world.
I rushed over here from a hearing in
the Judiciary Committee, a strange
hearing. The Acting Attorney General
that is going to be acting for another
week maybe had a big circus about
having him come in and testify in a
long hearing, where everybody gets to
go after him that wants to.
But in that hearing, as well as in
media in the past, as well as in other
hearings in the past, I kept hearing
friends across the aisle talk about
these great career officials in the De-
partment of Justice who were giving
great advice to Jeff Sessions, like to
recuse himself, and Jeff Sessions him-
self said: I listened to the career offi-
cials at the Department of Justice who
recommended that I recuse myself on
the Russia investigation.
Some of us heard—it was understood
who he was referring to as giving him
this great advice to recuse himself—
and you could say they were in career
positions. But these were not the ca-
reer positions or officials of days gone
by when a U.S. attorney or even some-
body in the Justice Department here in
Washington could be trusted to give
nonpolitical advice.
But as we have seen in the Depart-
ment of Justice and FBI scandals of
the last few years, we have people who
were disastrously political that were
seeking political victories through the
Justice Department and certainly were
not the nonpartisan, bipartisan people
of the past.
I know from working with U.S. attor-
neys and assistant U.S. attorneys in
decades past, we knew how they voted.
We knew party allegiance, whether
they were Republican or Democrat, but
when it came to criminal law, criminal
violations, those things, they may have
different personal philosophies, but
justice was justice. And if somebody
violated the law, they were going to
pursue it. They were not going to let
party affiliation or their regard or lack
of regard for the President or anybody
else keep them from pursuing justice.
But this has been an extraordinary
time in American history when we
have found a Department of Justice
had officials to the very top who were
far more political than they were just;
where people, even an Attorney Gen-
eral, would say they had a chance
meeting on a tarmac, when the facts of
the day indicate it really could not
have been a chance meeting on a
tarmac. And if it hadn’t been for a re-
porter spotting what he thought might
be former President Bill Clinton, no-
body would have ever known about
that meeting while, supposedly, Hillary
Clinton was under investigation.
b 1300
We now know there was never going
to be any prosecution of Hillary Clin-
ton, no matter how grievous or egre-
gious any criminal violation may have
been, even if it meant obstructing jus-
tice by destroying emails that had been
subpoenaed and destroying with a ham-
mer or with BleachBit cellphones or
computers.
This is clearly obstruction of justice.
Those would have been lay-down cases

to get convictions. But it was now
clear those were never going to be pur-
sued because the people who were in
position, supposedly career, some polit-
ical appointments, they were not going
to let that happen.
Now, people like Andrew McCabe and
Peter Strzok—the guy is the head of
FBI counterintelligence, and he has no
problem lying over and over and over
again. Then he has the gall to come in
and basically say, as his deposition tes-
timony ended, oh, he always tells the
truth.
Any good lawyer knows you don’t
ever say, ‘‘I always tell the truth,’’ be-
cause you make mistakes. But he did,
and that was a lie. He just couldn’t
help lying.
There were stories after the shock to
the Obama administration in having
Donald Trump win, the arrogance that
existed in the Democratic Party that,
gee, there is no way Donald Trump
could win, even though it certainly ap-
peared to be funny at the time when
President Obama—I think it may have
been on Letterman where he read
something about a comment that
Obama would go down as the worst
President, and he said: Yeah, at least I
will go down as having been President.
Everybody laughed because, gee, how
could he ever get elected President?
Well, he did.
So there were articles written and
word spread that in the remaining days
of the Obama administration after
Donald Trump was elected President,
there was a flurry of activity in No-
vember, December, and early January
to move people from political appoint-
ment positions into career positions in
all these different government depart-
ments and agencies, including the De-
partment of Justice.
If you look at the person who an-
swered to Rod Rosenstein, Tashina
Gauhar—she was the liaison between
the National Security Council and the
Attorney General, but she answered di-
rectly to Rod Rosenstein. That was a
change I understood that occurred in
the organizational chart for DOJ some
time back.
I tried to tell Jeff and persuade him:
You need to reorganize. You need to
have critical positions answering di-
rectly to you.
He didn’t know why he kept getting
such late notices to NSC meetings. Ev-
erybody else got them timely. What I
heard was Tashina Gauhar was getting
them timely like everybody else but
delaying Jeff Sessions getting them, so
he would either develop a conflict or he
would not have time to properly pre-
pare. He would go into the meetings
looking bad before the National Secu-
rity Council, because he wasn’t as pre-
pared as others were because he didn’t
get his notices timely as he should
have because a person who was more—
or certainly appeared to be much
more—devoted to Sally Yates and her
obstruction of the Trump administra-
tion was the one who was supposed to
pass on those notices to Jeff Sessions.
As we are seeing, there were people
who have been forced to leave the DOJ
and leave the FBI in scandal for lying.
I understand Andrew McCabe sup-
posedly is currently being investigated
for criminal violations. This is a guy
right there close to the top, nearly the
top, and he had become a political hack
and a political operative.
Others would look at somebody like
him or Peter Strzok and say these are
career people, so we can trust them,
without realizing, oh, no, they are po-
litically motivated, and they are going
to use their job for political purposes
to try to keep one party from winning
the Presidency and try to help another
to win the Presidency.
It is shocking what is going on. I be-
lieve that if the roles had been reversed
and that was a Republican FBI, Repub-
lican DOJ—it shouldn’t be political at
all, but it has been. But if that had
been them, and they were the doing to
a Democrat President what has been
done to this one, I just feel sure I
would have objected.
This is wrong. I don’t care what the
party is, you don’t abuse a justice sys-
tem for political purposes. I think I
would—I really believe it is one of the
things that makes some in my party so
mad at me sometimes when they are
not doing the right thing, and they are
not keeping their word.
It is still my hope and prayer, lit-
erally, that we will come together to
recognize what John Dingell did.
We work better when we work to-
gether. Apparently, at times, he called
Republicans in. He was so skilled at ne-
gotiating, but making clear: We are
going to get this bill passed, but we
want your buy-in. We want you in-
volved. We want you to have things in
it that you are proud of. So what do
you got? What do you need? What can
we work out?
That kind of diplomacy is going to be
sorely missed here. But one comfort is
I see so many of those traits in DEBBIE
DINGELL. John Dingell will be missed.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
f
REMEMBERING THE HONORABLE
JOHN D. DINGELL
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms.
TLAIB) for 30 minutes.
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor a legend, the Honorable
Congressman John D. Dingell, whom
we lovingly call in Michigan ‘‘The
Dean.’’
Congressman Dingell will truly be
missed. For 59 years, he served our
great State of Michigan and our coun-
try. He believed in the power of this in-
stitution, the power it had to trans-
form hate to love, to elevate the most
vulnerable and to uplift our servicemen
and -women.
Dean Dingell’s legacy will live on
with his memorable work on the his-
toric Civil Rights Act, the Clean Air
Act, and the need for universal
healthcare.
I still remember to this day as a
State legislator in Michigan when I
had an environmental injustice issue
going on in my district and he got me
a United States Coast Guard hearing, a
public hearing, in southwest Detroit.
He called me, and he said: Kid, this is
your last chance to fight the injustice.
I still remember coming in to serve
on a panel with him at the University
of Michigan—Ann Arbor campus on im-
migrant rights and the need for immi-
gration reform. I sat next to him, very
frustrated after a long day in Lansing
fighting for scrap metal reform, and
saying to him: How can you do it so
long? The special interest groups are so
tough, and they are so tainting the
process when it comes to issues that
matter for our people.
He taught me and spoke to me about
the power of stillness.
Congressman Dingell’s strength and
humanity will truly be missed. I thank
the gentleman for his wicked sense of
humor. Even more importantly, I am
grateful he was always so warm and
kind to us younger activists and for
never trying to reduce my voice or oth-
ers’ voices.
His drive for a better world will live
on with his lovely DEBORAH, as he calls
her, his best friend and my current sis-
ter in Congress, Congresswoman
DEBBIE DINGELL.
Some of the last things he was say-
ing, of course, was the incredible
humor that he had on Twitter, but I
still remember the specific thing that
he said: ‘‘I signed up to fight Nazis 73
years ago, and I’ll do it again if I have
to. Hatred, bigotry, and fascism should
have no place in this country.’’
As a Muslim girl growing up in
America today, I am grateful to Con-
gressman Dingell for his courage and
his love.
Rest in peace, my friend. Thank you
so much.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

HONORING STEVEN LOMBARDI AS
PUBLIC SAFETY HERO OF THE
YEAR
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 8, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor Senior Deputy
Steven Lombardi, whom I have named a Pub-
lic Safety Hero of the Year in Napa County,
California. Mr. Lombardi has provided 28
years of exceptional public service to the peo-
ple of Napa County and acted with true her-
oism on March 9, 2018.
Mr. Lombardi is an honorable community
member and public servant who does not
hesitate to help and protect others. On March
9, 2018 Mr. Lombardi responded to an active
shooter call at the Pathway Home on the
grounds of the Yountville Veteran’s Home.
Backup units were still minutes away when
Mr. Lombardi entered the facility alone with
the goal of locating and containing the heavily
armed shooter. Mr. Lombardi knew the danger
he was putting himself in, but rushed inside
the building anyway and made contact with
the suspect. Mr. Lombardi engaged him with
gunfire to prevent the shooter from harming
others. The suspect returned fire and narrowly
missed hitting Mr. Lombardi. Mr. Lombardi re-
mained inside the facility for over eight min-
utes until other responding units arrived on the
scene. He selflessly put his life in danger to
prevent the shooter from causing more harm
and pain upon others.
Mr. Lombardi is known for his compassion,
tireless work ethic and staunch commitment to
law enforcement and the people of Napa
County. Mr. Lombardi has served with the
Napa County Sheriff’s office for 28 years. He
has served as a range master, Mounted
Posse Coordinator, Administrative Deputy, Pa-
trol and Yountville Patrol during his tenure with
the Sheriff’s office. In addition, Mr. Lombardi is
a member of the Napa Valley Horsemen’s As-
sociation and the Skyline Riders, which he
helped found.
Madam Speaker, we thank Senior Deputy
Steven Lombardi for his dedication. It is there-
fore fitting and proper that we honor him here
today.

HAPPY 87TH BIRTHDAY, VERA
MORRIS
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 8, 2019
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor an extraordinary constituent of mine,
Mrs. Vera M. Morris of Yuma, Arizona who
today is celebrating her 87th birthday. Vera
has been a resident of Yuma for most of her
life, proudly serving her community in many
distinguished ways. Most notably, Mrs. Morris
served as the first librarian at Gadsden Ele-
mentary in Yuma County. She taught at Gads-
den for over two decades, inspiring hundreds
of children and showing them the importance
of reading at an early age. Mrs. Morris is the
proud mother of three children and has 25
grandchildren, and more than 30 great-grand-
children.
I hope the whole House will join me in wish-
ing Vera a very happy 87th birthday sur-
rounded by her loving family and her many
friends. We also wish her many more happy
birthdays in the future.

HONORING CRISTINA MONTOYA AS
PUBLIC SAFETY HERO OF THE
YEAR
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 8, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor Cristina Mon-
toya, whom I have named a Public Safety
Hero of the Year in Sonoma County, Cali-
fornia. Ms. Montoya is a dispatcher at the
Cotati Police, and has committed her life to
public service.
Ms. Montoya is a Santa Rosa native. She
earned her associate degree in General Edu-
cation from Santa Rosa Junior College. She
also graduated from the Public Safety Dis-
patcher Academy in Windsor, California. Ms.
Montoya joined the Cotati Police Department
as a part-time dispatcher, but once her natural
calmness and ease on the job was apparent,
she became a full-time dispatcher.
On December 26, 2017, Ms. Montoya
showed great initiative and saved lives. She
took a phone call reporting that an individual
stole a shotgun from B2 Enterprises Gun
Store. After dispatching officers to the location,
she became aware of pertinent details about
the suspect. She searched the Computer
Aided Dispatch communications of the
Sonoma County Sheriffs Department. Using
that database, Ms. Montoya recognized a
similar description of a suspect involved in an
assault on a family in Penngrove and con-
nected the two incidents. She shared the con-
nection she had discovered with the Cotati Po-
lice Department, which was then able to work
with deputies to apprehend the suspect and
stolen gun. Ms. Montoya was able to mitigate
a situation that could have easily escalated by
thinking quickly and using the knowledge she
has gained as a dispatcher.
Ms. Montoya is active in our community
when she is not at work, as well. She volun-
teers at Gravenstein Elementary School,
where her son attends first grade, and sup-
ports the Gravenstein School District’s En-
riched program.
Madam Speaker, we thank Cristina Montoya
for her dedication. For this reason, it is fitting
and proper that we honor her here today.

IN HONOR OF BILLY MARTIN
HON. LANCE GOODEN
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 8, 2019
Mr. GOODEN. Madam Speaker, Billy Martin
joined the National Guard while a senior in
high school and subsequently applied for ac-
tive duty in the United States Army receiving
his first permanent duty station in Idar
Oberstine, Germany from 1956 to 1959. Over
the next 16 years he went to the Seventh
Army NCO Academy, Officer Candidate
School and Fixed Wing Flight School attaining
the rank of Major. After his first 12-month tour
in Vietnam, Billy transitioned into CH–47 (Chi-
nook) helicopters returning to Vietnam as Ex-
ecutive Officer of the 178th Aviation Company
and as the Combat Operations Officer (S3) of
the 123rd Aviation Battalion in support of the
American Division. During Billy’s two tours in
Vietnam he was awarded the Distinguished
Flying Cross twice, the Bronze Star 3 times
(one for Valor), the Air Medal thirteen times
(one for Valor), the Army Commendation
Medal for Valor, the Meritorious Service
Medal, and the Vietnam Gallantry Cross. In
1971 he was transferred to the University of
Nebraska at Omaha for one year so he could
complete requirements for his Bachelor’s de-
gree. In June of 1972, Billy became an Assist-
ant Professor of Military Science at the Univer-
sity of Tennessee in Knoxville, TN. He retired
from Military Service on December 31, 1975.
In retirement Mr. Martin worked as a busi-
ness consultant eventually moving to Dallas.
But Billy had always believed he had a calling
to be a missionary. He taught Sunday school
and Bible study, but grew to believe he was
meant to be a preacher. Due to his age he
faced roadblocks. Not to be deterred, how-
ever, he started taking seminary courses and
achieved his Master’s in Theology degree in
1994.
In 1998 Billy was told there was a church in
Terrell in need of a pastor. He went to Terrell
and spoke with the Director of Missions,
Brother Jerry Griffin. Brother Jerry rec-
ommended Billy give his resume to Emmanuel
Baptist Church instead of Grace Temple. Em-
manuel called him as its pastor that August.
More than 20 years as pastor of Emmanuel,

Thursday, February 7, 2019
The House in Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union had under
consideration the bill (H.R. 840) to amend
title 38, United States Code, to direct the
Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide
child care assistance to veterans receiving
certain medical services provided by the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs:
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Chair, I rise in
support of H.R. 840, the Veterans’ Access to
Child Care Act, which permanently authorizes
the Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Child Care Program.
Absent Congressional action, the VA’s Child
Care Pilot Program will expire on October 1,
2019.
This bill would ensure that all veterans who
are primary caretakers have a safe, reliable,
and cost-free option for child care when they
access VA healthcare.
I have previously supported this bill, when
the House of Representatives passed H.R. 95
in the 115th Congress.
I support H.R. 840, and I would vote for this
legislation tomorrow. However, I will be speak-
ing at the funeral of a dear friend.

HONORING RITZIE TOLENTINO AS
PUBLIC SAFETY HERO OF THE
YEAR
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 8, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor Corporal Ritzie
Tolentino, whom I have named a Public Safety
Hero of the Year in Solano County, California.
Mr. Tolentino has dedicated himself to pub-
lic service and our community since he grad-
uated from the Napa Valley Police Academy in
2002. After graduation, Mr. Tolentino worked
for the St. Helena Police Department until
2006. In 2006, Mr. Tolentino made a lateral
move to the Vallejo Police Department and in
2010 joined the Richmond Police Department.
Mr. Tolentino returned to the Vallejo Police
Department in 2011 and has continued to
serve our community since then. In November
of 2018, Mr. Tolentino was promoted to the
rank of Corporal. He has served as Patrol,
Kaiser and SWAT, and is a Force Operations
Instructor as well.
On August 29, 2018, Mr. Tolentino showed
his deep commitment to public safety when he
helped a suicidal man and convinced him not
to jump from an overpass and to instead re-
ceive mental health treatment. Mr. Tolentino
talked with the distressed man and built the
rapport necessary to make progress in this sit-
uation. When members of the Vallejo Police
Department’s Hostage Negotiation Team ar-
rived, they saw Mr. Tolentino’s connection with
the man and progress in diffusing the situa-
tion. Mr. Tolentino talked and negotiated with
the man for several hours until he agreed to
climb back onto the overpass and get treat-
ment from Solano County Mental Health Serv-
ices. Mr. Tolentino’s calm demeanor, patience
and professionalism helped to save a life that
day.
Madam Speaker, we thank Corporal Ritzie
Tolentino for his dedication. For this reason, it
is fitting and proper that we honor him here
today.

RECOGNIZING DELISA RUSSELL
HON. BILL FLORES
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 8, 2019
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Delisa Russell of Waco, Texas,
former Executive Director of the Heart of
Texas Veterans One Stop.
The Heart of Texas Veterans One Stop
opened in 2013 as a central location where
veterans and their families could access avail-
able resources under one roof. The first of its
kind in the nation, Veterans One Stop is a
comprehensive veteran service resource that
offers mental health counseling, legal services,
assistance with veterans’ benefits and claims,
and provides access to food, showers, laun-
dry, and fitness facilities.
Prior to coming to the One Stop in 2016,
Delisa served others, including veterans,
through social work and counseling. Delisa
graduated from Baylor with a bachelor’s de-
gree in Political Science with a minor in social
work, and continued her education at Baylor
with two master’s degrees in Sociology and
Psychology. She focused her career toward
counseling those in need and leading organi-
zations dedicated to the care of the most vul-
nerable.
Delisa recently stepped down from her posi-
tion at the One Stop to pursue other opportu-
nities to help the community. The impact of
her time as Executive Director cannot be over-
stated.
In her three years as Director, Delisa super-
vised the transition of Heart of Texas Veterans
One Stop to a larger location. This new loca-
tion was able to increase the amount of serv-
ices the One Stop provided, with new show-
ers, laundry, and kitchen facilities, all donated
by the members of our Central Texas commu-
nity. In 2017, the Guardians for Heroes Foun-
dation, which carries out the mission of the
late Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, installed a gym at
the One Stop for veterans to maintain their
physical and mental health.
Last year, the Veterans One Stop opened
the Robert Carter Veteran Transition home.
This home is aimed at helping veterans with
families to create a stable environment during
their adjustment from military to civilian life.
Veterans One Stop covers the cost of utilities
at the home, which was built and furnished
with support from the community. One Stop
helps the families develop a plan for life after
living in the home.
Under Delisa’s leadership, the Veterans
One Stop has gone from serving less than
2,000 veterans to over 24,000. Each week,
the One Stop serves meals to more than 200
veterans and last year’s annual Thanksgiving
dinner was its largest, serving more than 800
people.
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank
Delisa Russell for all of her service to the vet-
erans in the Central Texas community. I wish
her the best in her future endeavors and look
forward to seeing the Veterans One Stop’s
continued progress.
I have requested that a United States flag
be flown over our Nation’s Capitol to recog-
nize the accomplishments of Delisa Russell
and the Heart of Texas Veterans One Stop.
As I close today, I urge all Americans to
continue praying for our country, for our vet-
erans, for our military men and women who
protect us, and for our first responders who
keep us safe at home.

HONORING ELONA PORTER AS
PUBLIC SAFETY HERO OF THE
YEAR
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 8, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Honor-
able Elona Porter, whom I have named a Pub-
lic Safety Hero of the Year in Lake County,
California.
Ms. Porter was born in Landstuhl, Germany
and currently resides in Lake County, Cali-
fornia. She holds an Associate of Science De-
gree in Administration of Justice. Ms. Porter
began her career with the Lake County Sher-
iff’s Office as a Records Technician, became
Evidence Technician, and was then promoted
as the supervisor of that unit. She is also the
department’s lead crime scene investigator.
Over her nearly two-decade tenure with the
Lake County Sheriff’s Office, Ms. Porter has
worked on many high-level investigations, in-
cluding sexual assaults, homicides, and bur-
glaries. While these investigations are typically
carried out by sworn deputies or police offi-
cers, Ms. Porter presides over these respon-
sibilities at the Lake County Sheriff’s Office
because of her skill. Her work has led to the
successful conclusion of many investigations
and the administration of justice, that has in
turn led to a degree of closure for the victims’
family members. Ms. Porter is one of Califor-
nia’s top authorities on crime scene investiga-
tion and has been recognized by the California
Commission on Peace Officer Standards and
Training.
Ms. Porter is continually striving to improve
her skills as well as help the next generation

of crime scene investigators. She has at-
tended trainings on crime scene reconstruction
and scene logistics, crime scene photography,
and the FBI’s Field Evidence Response
course, among others. She teaches crime
scene investigation classes to police officers
and investigators across California. Ms. Porter
also regularly gives presentations to Lake
County high school and middle school stu-
dents, Boy and Girl Scouts, college classes,
and Sheriff’s Citizen’s Academy students.
Madam Speaker, we thank Ms. Porter for
her dedication. For this reason, it is fitting and
proper that we honor her here today.

VETERANS’ ACCESS TO CHILD
CARE ACT
SPEECH OF
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, February 7, 2019
The House in Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union had under
consideration the bill (H.R. 840) to amend
title 38, United States Code, to direct the
Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide
child care assistance to veterans receiving
certain medical services provided by the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs:
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Chair, I
rise today in support of the Veterans’ Access
to Child Care Act. This bill ensures that Vet-
erans in my district and around the country
have convenient access to no-cost child care
when visiting a VA facility for a medical ap-
pointment.
After a survey conducted by the VA last
decade found that access to child care was a
top reason as to why some veterans were
missing their medical appointments, a pilot
program providing no-cost drop-in child care
service for veterans was established as part of
the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health
Services Act of 2010. I am proud that the Dal-
las VA Medical Center is one of four VA facili-
ties that are currently piloting the program.
This legislation would make the pilot program
permanent across the country.
This program has made it easier for parents
within my district to schedule appointments at
the Dallas VA Medical Center without having
to deal with the stress and worry of finding
safe and affordable child care options for their
children. I am pleased to see that thanks to
this important legislation, child care facilities
like the Carousel Academy at the Dallas VA
Medical Center may soon open up across the
country. I urge my colleagues to support this
legislation because veterans nationwide
should have access to the same quality child
care services that veterans in North Texas
have been fortunate to have for the past six
years.

HONORING FIRE CAPTAIN RICH-
ARD LAWLER AS PUBLIC SAFE-
TY HERO OF THE YEAR
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 8, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor CAL FIRE Fire
Captain Richard Lawler, whom I have named
a Public Safety Hero of the Year in Lake
County, California.
Mr. Lawler is from Huntington Beach, Cali-
fornia. He began his career in public service in
the United States Marine Corps and was de-
ployed to Operation Desert Storm. Mr. Lawler
then joined the United States Forest Service’s
firefighting team. He worked on Hot Shot
Crews and fire engines in southern California
until he was assigned to the Mendocino Na-
tional Forest. In 2008 Mr. Lawler joined the
California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection (CAL FIRE). He spent three years
serving at Parlin Fork Camp, three years at
Konocti Camp and two years at Kelsey Cobb
Station. For the last three years he has been
assigned to Clearlake Oaks Station.
For over twenty years, Mr. Lawler has been
a member of the Northshore Fire Protection
District. He is a senior member of the Water
Rescue and SCUBA Dive Team that serves
Lake County and is a firefighter and para-
medic for the district. He is also a member of
the Lakeport Fire Protection District. Mr.
Lawler is also a certified paramedic, rescue
diver, and Haz-Mat technician.
Mr. Lawler is committed to public service
and dedicated to protecting our community
from the ever-present threat of fires. During
the Tubbs Fire in 2017, Mr. Lawler was part
of a small group that worked to prevent the
fire from crossing Calistoga Road, stopping
additional damage to Sonoma County. He was
then reassigned to the Napa County portion of
the fire. He joined the leadership and they
worked to stop the fire’s advancement towards
Lake County. When the Pawnee Fire broke
out in 2018, Mr. Lawler raced to keep the fire
from spreading into Colusa County in just a
few hours. He was also active in the response
to the Ranch and River Fires. He was part of
the initial attack against the fires and still helps
property owners fix their damaged fencing.
Madam Speaker, we thank Mr. Lawler for
his dedication. For this reason, it is fitting and
proper that we honor him here today.

HONORING FIRE CAPTAIN STEVE
BECKER AS PUBLIC SAFETY
HERO OF THE YEAR
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 8, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor Fire Captain
Steve Becker, whom I have named a Public
Safety Hero of the Year in Napa County, Cali-
fornia.
Mr. Becker was born in Auburn, California,
moved to Napa as a young child, and has
lived in Yountville for the past twenty years.
He took general education courses and re-
ceived EMT and Law Enforcement certifi-
cations from Napa Valley College. He grad-
uated from California Polytechnic State Uni-
versity, San Luis Obispo with a Bachelor of
Science degree in Recreation Administration,
with a focus in Programming and Leadership.
Mr. Becker began his career in 1990 as a
Reserve Firefighter with the Napa Fire Depart-
ment. From 1991 to 1996 he served in other
fire departments as well. He worked for the
San Luis Obispo County Fire Department, Cal
Poly San Luis Obispo Fire Department, Cal
Poly Police Department and the San Luis
Obispo County Sheriffs Office. In 1996 Mr.
Becker became a Professional Firefighter in
the Napa Fire Department. He was appointed
as a Department Shift Inspector/Investigator in
2001 and in 2010 was promoted to be a De-
partment Captain.
Throughout his life Mr. Becker has remained
focused on public service and safety and the
greater good of our community. After a Napa
student caught on fire from a flame jetting inci-
dent at a science camp in the summer of
2018, Mr. Becker became determined to pre-
vent such instances from occurring. He de-
voted much of his time to researching flame
jetting and has become a passionate advocate
for flame arrestors and H.R. 806, which would
require compliant flame mitigation devices to
be used on portable fuel containers for flam-
mable liquid fuels.
Madam Speaker, we thank Steve Becker for
his dedication. For this reason, it is fitting and
proper that we honor him here today.

Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, today I offer
my heartfelt congratulations to Mrs. Michelle

of Carlisle’s prestigious Molly Pitcher Award.
Chartered by the National Exchange Club in

HONORING DAVE WOODS AS PUB-
LIC SAFETY HERO OF THE YEAR
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 8, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Fire Captain
Dave Woods, whom I have named a Public
Safety Hero of the Year in Contra Costa
County, California.
Mr. Woods was born in Pasadena, Cali-
fornia and raised in nearby Glendale. In March
of 1999 Mr. Woods joined the Contra Costa
County Fire Protection District and has been
heavily involved since. He is trained and cer-
tified as a Strike Team Leader and Fire Line
Paramedic to assist on Strike Team assign-
ments. Strike Teams consist of highly trained
wildland firefighters, who are prepared to re-
spond to wildland fires anywhere in the state
with little support. They carry enough food and
supplies to fight fires in the wilderness for mul-
tiple days and are essential in cutting off fires
before they destroy population centers. Mr.
Woods was assigned as a Strike Team Lead-
er to the Thomas Fire that burned much of
southern California in December of 2017. Mr.
Woods also shares his knowledge and skills
with others as a Wildland Firefighting Instruc-
tor.
Mr. Woods works in Contra Costa County
Fire Protection District’s busiest battalion.
However, he does not let the fast pace pro-
hibit his development as a leader within the
battalion and Fire Protection District. For the
past twenty years he has spent at the Fire
Protection District, Mr. Woods has shown un-
relenting commitment to serving the people of
Contra Costa County and protecting our com-
munity and state from wildfires.
Madam Speaker, we thank Dave Woods for
his dedication. For this reason, it is fitting and
proper that we honor him here today.

Friday, February 8, 2019
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor an exemplary public servant,
Police Chief Tommy Payne, upon his retire-
ment from the Aubrey, Texas Police Depart-
ment. During his more than four decades in
law enforcement, Chief Payne has endeav-
ored to provide safety and security for those
he has served.
Chief Payne’s career began in his home-
town of Dublin, Texas in 1977. He spent many
years serving in various jurisdictions across
Texas, including Stephenville, Llano, Brady,
and Somervell County. He has been a Master
Peace Officer since 1994, and was first
named Police Chief in 2003 while serving the
City of Brady.
Chief Payne began serving the citizens and
businesses covered by the Aubrey Police De-
partment in April of 2010. For the past nine
years, he has been a well-respected leader by
his peers and colleagues and beloved by his
community.
After 42 years of dedicated service, Police
Chief Tommy Payne has more than earned
his retirement. He has put strangers’ safety
above his own, and we are indebted to him.
I wish Chief Payne and his family all the best
in the years to come.

BAILLIE AS PUBLIC SAFETY
HERO OF THE YEAR
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 8, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Corporal
Ryan Baillie, whom I have named a Public
Safety Hero of the Year in Contra Costa
County.
Mr. Baillie was born in the Bay Area and
has shown a penchant for public service since
he was a member of the Boy Scouts of Amer-
ica. He was a Merit Badge Counselor and an
Eagle Scout, the highest honor in the Boy
Scouts of America, before beginning his ca-
reer in law enforcement. Mr. Baillie joined the
Martinez Police Department as a Cadet in
2004. In 2007, he became a Police Assistant
and a Reserve Police Officer. He was sworn
in as a full-time Police Officer in 2008 and has
many roles within the Department since then.
He has worked as a patrolman, detective, and
a corporal. His collateral duties have included
Hostage Negotiator and Explorer Advisor and
he has been a member of the Patrol Rifle
Team, Bicycle Patrol Unit, Off-Road Motor-
cycle Team and Honor Guard.
As a detective, Mr. Baillie works tirelessly to
bring offenders to justice so victims can begin
to heal. Mr. Baillie came across a March 2012
report of a woman detailing her kidnapping
and forced sexual servitude. He dedicated
three years to leading an investigation into the
woman’s claims. Mr. Baillie’s investigation led
him to additional victims and he uncovered
what is considered Contra Costa County’s
worst human trafficking case. Mr. Baillie lis-
tened to many hours of recorded conversa-
tions from the perpetrator’s time in jail on gun
charges and persuaded some of the additional
victims of the perpetrator of the trafficking ring
to cooperate. In no small part because of his
diligence and methodical approach to the
case, the perpetrator was charged on 40 fel-
ony charges and sentenced to 180 years to
life in prison.
Madam Speaker, we thank Ryan Baillie for
his dedication. For this reason, it is fitting and
proper that we honor him here today.

celebrate the career of Lisa Ferrero at Corning
Incorporated, and congratulate her on her re-
tirement.
For more than thirty years, Lisa Ferrero has
served Corning Incorporated in a spectrum of
roles and functions. Her dedicated service and
exceptional management has led her to rise
from a statistician in the Corning Big Flats
Plant to become Senior Vice President and
Chief Administrative Officer of the company.
Throughout her career, Lisa has traveled
the globe managing various aspects of Cor-
ning business. Her many years spent working
in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and China, have fos-
tered her success as head of Global Supply
Management and Global Information Security.
Lisa’s leadership at Corning has touched
many aspects of the company, lending her
skills to Environmental Technologies, Display

Government Affairs.
As Lisa moves forward with the next chapter

ated hospitals, residences and nursing facili-
ties. No task was too small for her. She did
everything within her power to help residents

HONORING HELLAS LIBERTY
HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 8, 2019
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate the 10th Anniversary
of the Hellas Liberty Maritime Museum and
the Hellenic Merchant Marines.
Madam Speaker, we must recognize the
Hellenic Merchant Marines and their heroic
deeds during World War II, with over 2,000
Hellenic Merchant Marine lives lost and close
to 70 percent of the Hellenic Shipping fleet
being decimated by the Axis Powers. Hellenic
merchant ships transported much needed sup-
plies across the treacherous Atlantic Ocean
for the Allies.
The Arthur M. Huddell, built in 1943 in the
great state of Florida, was commissioned in
the PLUTO (Pipe Line under the Ocean) oper-
ation, which supplied oil to our allies in Europe
during World War Two. It is one of the few re-
maining Liberty Ships, built for this purpose. In
a post-war period, the vessel was continually
used to create underwater infrastructure func-
tioning largely as a cable ship, occasionally re-
sponding to the request of the U.S. Navy.
After serving our country dutifully, first for
the Navy, then for commercial uses, the Arthur
M. Huddell was retired in 1984, laid up with
the majority of the U.S. reserve fleet in the
James River. This retirement was not perma-
nent; the 21st century saw renewed attention
at the retired fleet to be used for educational
purposes.
The Greek State was interested in acquiring
the vessel, to be used as a floating museum.
The reciprocal aspiration of the U.S. govern-
ment, the result of action taken by many
Greek-Americans who were following Rhode
Island Senator Leonidas Raptakis and Con-
necticut representative Dimitrios Yiannaros,
with much of the mobilization activated by ship
owner Spyros M. Polemis as well.
The U.S. and Greece reached and signed
an agreement on June 30, 2008. After U.S.
Maritime Administrator Sean Connaughton
and Greek Minister of Merchant Marine
Georgios Voulgarakis completed this transfer
of ownership, The Arthur M. Huddell was offi-
cially renamed to the Hellas Liberty. Departing
a month later, the ship arrived in Greece, for
extended repairs before being recommis-
sioned as a floating museum.
On February 8, 2019, the museum will cele-
brate its 10th anniversary, honoring the close
and fruitful relationship between Greece and
the United States of America. Congratulations
to all.

Friday, February 8, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today

Innkeeper’s has been a space for the
Galesburg community to come together since
1998 when Mike Bond and Johan Ewalt first
began serving freshly roasted coffee. In 2003,
the two took a chance and decided to expand
their business even as factory closings threat-

keeper’s managed to succeed, grow and be-
come a central space for friends and family to
enjoy one another’s company. Innkeeper’s
small batch roasting method and their use of
environmentally friendly shade-grown coffee
sets them apart.
It is in small businesses like Innkeeper’s
that rural communities have found stability and
their perseverance makes me proud to serve
Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam

them for their service to our community.
HONORING FIRE CAPTAIN DON
RICCI AS PUBLIC SAFETY HERO
OF THE YEAR
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 8, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor Santa Rosa
Fire Captain Don Ricci, whom I have named
a Public Safety Hero of the Year in Sonoma
County, California.
Mr. Ricci is a Sonoma County native. He
graduated from Montgomery High School and
attended the Santa Rosa Safety Center, a de-
partment at the Santa Rosa Junior College.
He began his career in public service in 1992
when he joined the Bennet Valley Fire Protec-
tion District. Mr. Ricci served in that depart-
ment as a firefighter, engineer and lieutenant.
In 1998, he joined the Santa Rosa Fire De-
partment as a firefighter-paramedic. In 2002
Mr. Ricci was promoted to Engineer and in
2004, to Fire Captain. He also serves as a
lead instructor for the Live Burn Cadre and as
a paramedic Field Training Officer. Addition-
ally, he is a Tactical Paramedic on Henry 1
(the Sonoma County Sheriff’s helicopter) and
the SWAT Team in the Sonoma County Sher-
iff’s Department.
On January 22, 2018, Mr. Ricci displayed
the utmost dedication to public service and fire
safety. He was on Medic Engine 5 when it
was dispatched to an odor investigation that
was revealed to be a working structure fire.
Mr. Ricci upgraded the assignment and in-
structed his team to launch a defensive fire at-
tack. As he gathered intelligence around the
property, a house, he saw a neighbor trying to
rescue an elderly woman from a small win-
dow. After he realized he was unable to res-
cue the resident from outside the structure,
and knowing the window was too small to
enter with a self-contained breathing appa-
ratus, he removed the apparatus and entered
the smoke-filled building. Mr. Ricci first evacu-
ated the resident out of the small window he
had entered. He then evacuated the resident’s
dog. Because of his courage and swift action,
Mr. Ricci prevented a tragic loss of life in our
community.
Madam Speaker, we thank Fire Captain
Don Ricci for his dedication. For this reason,
it is fitting and proper that we honor him today.
