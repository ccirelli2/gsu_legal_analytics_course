OFFICER LARRY HARRIS RETIRES
FROM THE CALIFORNIA HIGH-
WAY PATROL
HON. PAUL COOK
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the outstanding law enforcement ca-
reer of California Highway Patrol Officer Larry
Harris, who retired on June 28, 2019 after 23
years of service.
After completing CHP Academy in 1996, Of-
ficer Harris was assigned as a new officer to
the Newhall area. Following his first assign-
ment, he spent four years working in the West
and South Los Angeles Area. Officer Harris
then went on to serve the Barstow and Lake
Arrowhead areas from 2001 to 2006, after
which he transferred to the Victorville station
where he has spent the remainder of his ca-
reer.
On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, I offer my sincere congratulations to Offi-
cer Larry Harris for his 23 years of service as
a member of the California Highway Patrol
and wish him an enjoyable and relaxing retire-
ment. Over the course of his career he has
personified the California Highway Patrol
motto ‘‘Safety, Service, and Security’’ with
hard work, dedication, and professionalism.

HONORING JARON BROWN AS RUT-
GERS—CAMDEN MALE STUDENT
VETERAN OF THE YEAR
HON. ANDY KIM
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mr. KIM. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize Jaron Brown of Mount Laurel New
Jersey, who was named as the Rutgers Uni-
versity—Camden male Student Veteran of the
Year.
Jaron served in the U.S. Air Force from
2005 to 2017, attaining the rank of Staff Ser-
geant. During his service, Jaron deployed five
times with his unit to Qatar, Kuwait, Turkey
and Kyrgyzstan in support of Operations En-
during Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and Operation
New Dawn. After his overseas deployment, he
transferred to Joint Base McGuire-Dix-
Lakehurst in New Jersey, where he spent
three years as a contingency response team
chief, and from which he deployed to Iraq in
support of Operation Inherent Resolve.
After ending his active duty service in 2017,
Jaron chose to pursue his bachelor’s degree
at Rutgers University—Camden, enrolling in
the fall of 2018. Upon his arrival to campus,
he began to work in the Office of Military and
Veterans Affairs at the University, and became
active in the student veterans’ group on cam-
pus, where he now serves as president. Jaron
remains a leader supporting the military and
veteran community on campus, assisting other
veterans in their transition from military life to
college life.
Jaron Brown serves as an example of tre-
mendous sacrifice, determination and dedica-
tion to his fellow servicemembers. I commend
him for his desire to not only pursue his de-
gree, but also to engage with the campus
community and assist other veterans in their
transition.
I’d like to thank Jaron for his service to our
country, and for continuing to engage the stu-
dent veteran community in South Jersey.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DONALD
NATHAN CARR
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
celebrate and honor the life of Donald (Don)
Nathan Carr. Sadly, Don passed away unex-
pectedly on Monday, November 18, 2019.
Don was born in Texas on June 27, 1951.
Upon graduation from high school in 1969,
Don joined the U.S. Army and served in the
Vietnam Conflict. He became an Army Public
Affairs officer, serving in Thailand, Germany,
Texas, Alaska, and for five years at the Pen-
tagon. He retired as a Master Sergeant in
1990 following 21 years of honorable service
to our nation.
After his retirement from active duty, he
began his civil service career at Fort Belvoir,
located in Fairfax County, Virginia. His first po-
sition at Fort Belvoir was Editor of the Belvoir
Eagle and he quickly advanced to Command
Information Chief and finally to the position of
Director of Public Affairs. Don believed that it
was crucial for Fort Belvoir to fully engage the
non-military community in order to create a
true partnership in the sweeping changes that
faced the region and the Garrison.
Of course, one of the most significant chal-
lenges during Don’s tenure was Base Realign-
ment and Closure (BRAC) which greatly ex-
panded the mission and footprint of Fort
Belvoir and transferred countless DoD agen-
cies and departments, as well as tens of thou-
sands of employees and soldiers to Fort
Belvoir.
As then-Chairman of the Fairfax County
Board of Supervisors, I worked with Fort
Belvoir to ensure this process would be as
smooth as possible. A major concern of the
community was the impact on the region’s al-
ready congested roads. Upon my election to
Congress in 2008, these concerns and others
persisted, largely because the BRAC plan pro-
vided no funding for transportation. Finally,
through a genuine collaboration between DoD,
local and state partners, and federal funding of
$61 million through the Recovery Act, the Fair-
fax County Parkway was completed. The com-
munication and transparency of Fort Belvoir
leadership, including Don, were instrumental in
achieving this goal.
Don was also of great assistance to my of-
fice with resolving any issues brought to my
attention from those stationed or working at
Fort Belvoir. He would consistently take
prompt action to resolve any problems that
arose. He retired from civil service in 2012,
having served our nation—in uniform and
out—for a combined total of 43 years, Even
after his retirement, he was always available
to discuss issues and provide guidance to my
office,
Madam Speaker, Don was a kind and gen-
erous man and will be greatly missed. I ask
my colleagues to join me in expressing our
deepest condolences to Don’s wife, Noy, his
children and his grandchildren. He was de-
voted to his family and I know how much joy
they gave him. I hope that the outpouring of
sympathy and support from Don’s colleagues,
friends, and our community will be a source of
strength and comfort to his family during this
time.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF
SHARON ENOCH-HESTER
HON. TIM RYAN
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life of Sharon Enoch-Hester, of Har-
risburg, PA, who passed away on November
10, 2019 at the age of 63.
Sharon is the daughter of Ernestine Enoch
and Vincent Wilson and was employed as a
teacher in the Harrisburg School District in
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. She was a member
of Zeta Phi Beta and a graduate of
Shippensburg University. Sharon obtained her
Master’s Degree from the University of Scran-
ton and participated in the Doctorate Program
at the University of Pennsylvania.
Sharon is survived by her husband, the be-
loved Samuel Hester, by her mother Ernes-
tine, her children Aaron and Michael Hester, a
brother Warren Enoch, and her aunt Mary
Louise Graves. Also, she is survived by a host
of nieces, nephews, and friends.
I am very blessed to have gotten to know
Sharon’s husband, Sam, who works in the
Member’s Gym. I am so sorry for this painful
loss, and I hope he feels the support and love
that we are sending him during this time.
Sharon will certainly be missed by all whose

HONORING GARY MERVIS, CHAIR-
MAN OF THE ROCHESTER
PROJECT EXILE ADVISORY
BOARD
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to
honor Chairman of the Rochester Project Exile
Advisory Board and Camp Good Days found-
er, Gary Mervis.
Gary has been the Chairman of the Roch-
ester Project Exile Advisory Board since its in-
ception in 1998. It is the longest running
Project Exile in the country. There is a reason
this program has withstood the sands of
time—its success is abundantly clear and the
statistics are staggering. I was fascinated by
the facts and figures of this program’s suc-
cess—five hundred seventy-seven defendants
indicted and fifteen thousand six hundred ille-
gal guns removed from our streets. That last
statistic is incredible, since Rochester had a
homicide rating of seventy in the late nineties
when this program began. The homicide rate
qualified Rochester as having the highest per
capita homicide rate of any city in New York
State.
In developing this program, community lead-
ers, officials and other community members
stood up and said ‘‘No more!’’ Gary and his
colleagues began meeting once a month to
help battle the scourge of illegal guns and
drugs in this community, doing what they
could do to make things better. As it has been
said, ‘‘The only thing necessary for the tri-
umph of evil is that good men do nothing.’’
Gary and his fellow citizens of Rochester
could have remained motionless and let guns
and drugs take over the neighborhoods—but
they did not. Instead, they gathered together
and created a really remarkable program that
works—and it shows. Those statistics from the
nineties have never recurred. I applaud Gary’s
leadership and the efforts of those involved
with Project Exile and encourage these efforts
to continue on into the future. This program
has been a shining beacon for others through-
out the country—and its success has allowed
other programs to flourish as well.
Gary has clearly given much of himself for
his community in service. I thank Gary for all
that he has done and will do in the future.
Given the above, l ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
honor Chairman of the Rochester Project Exile
Advisory Board and Camp Good Days found-
er, Gary Mervis.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTH-
DAY OF CHARLOTTE WINELAND
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize Ms. Charlotte Wineland on the oc-
casion of her 100th birthday. Charlotte was
born Lilian Charlotte Oheim on August 10,
1919, in Baltimore, Maryland to Christopher
and Lilian Oheim. In 1923 her family relocated
to Washington, D.C. where she was raised
with her brother, Bill. As a child, Charlotte en-
joyed playing Jacks and learned to play the
piano. Her brother Bill earned money deliv-
ering the Evening Star newspaper. Like most
people in the 1920s, the Oheims did not have
a car. Young Charlotte walked all over the
city, running errands and buying groceries for
her mother, who would often send Charlotte
back to demand the highest quality items.
Charlotte became known as the ‘‘bring back
girl’’ to the local grocers. Charlotte graduated
from Eliot Junior High School and Eastern
High School. She then attended business
school before working for a local company and
later she accepted a position in the Office of
Congressman Fred Crawford on Capitol Hill.
Charlotte met her future husband, Lloyd
Wineland Jr. while attending the circus in
1937. Charlotte and Lloyd married in 1939 and
had four children, Linda, Christine, Nancy and
Lloyd Ill. She was a devoted and doting moth-
er and decided to be a stay-at-home mom
until their youngest began school. They lived
and raised their children on several acres in
Southeast Washington, D.C. Lloyd became
president of his family’s movie theater busi-
ness, Wineland Theaters, growing the chain to
20 theaters by the 1960’s. They moved to Vir-
ginia in 1962.
Charlotte has always been an involved com-
munity member and was active in the Meth-
odist church and her children’s activities. She
was a Girl Scout and Job’s Daughters leader;
and in the 1960s Charlotte led the Anacostia
Lion Cell group in producing a cook book to
raise funds for construction of Cafritz Hospital
in S.E., D.C. In her spare time, she often de-
livered meals on wheels.
In 1978, Charlotte and Lloyd moved to the
Eastern Shore of Maryland and began the
next chapter of their lives. Lloyd expanded the
family business and became an antiques ap-
praiser. They gave several gifts of fine paint-
ings and antiques to the State Depaiiment for
the reception rooms. Their collection of Native
American and Western Explorative Literature
is now a part of the Smithsonian Libraries col-
lection. After Lloyd’s death in 1985, Charlotte
moved to Oakton, Virginia where she has re-
mained active with organizations including the
Oakton United Methodist Church, the Oakton
Women’s Club and the Friends of Oakton Li-
brary. An avid traveler, she has visited many
countries both with her husband and following
his death, with other family members and
friends. Well into her eighties she continued
traveling with Elder Hostel.
Throughout her life, Charlotte has enjoyed
entertaining friends and family. She has al-
ways been known for her lavish meals, amaz-
ing cooking, and warm hospitality. Charlotte
has had many other hobbies which she mas-
tered—knitting both by hand and machine,
crocheting, tatting, embroidering and china
painting. Over the years she has hand painted
over 7 sets of china for her grandchildren and
countless exceptional pieces for family and
friends.
It is remarkable to note that Charlotte has
seen 100 years of Washington, D.C. politics.
She was born in the year in which women fi-
nally got the right to vote and has witnessed
tremendous demographic changes including
the first African American President and
record-setting numbers of women from all
walks of life running for and being elected into
office. ln 2012 she participated in organizing.
‘‘Experience Speaking’’ which encouraged
senior citizens to give testimony as to what
one should consider when voting in an elec-
tion.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in wishing Charlotte Wineland a very
happy 100th birthday and in thanking her for
her many decades of service to her commu-
nity. May she enjoy this very special occasion
surrounded by the warmth and love of her
family and friends including her children,
seven grandchildren, six great-grandchildren
and one great-great-grandson.

HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Joseph R. Peterson and
celebrate the dedication of the Joseph R.
Peterson Justice Building. Joseph Peterson is
an influential leader in Wyandotte and his con-
tributions to our community are worthy of com-
mendation.
Joseph Peterson is a cornerstone of Wyan-
dotte. For nearly four decades, Peterson has
been an active member of the community,
striving to make the city a better place for all.
Before beginning his career in public service,
Peterson spent 27 years serving the city as a
police officer in the Wyandotte Police Depart-
ment. Upon his retirement, Peterson became
active in public service and was elected to the
Wyandotte City Council in 2005. By 2009,
Peterson was elected mayor—a position he
has held ever since.

The naming of the Joseph R. Peterson Jus-
tice Building underscores Joseph Peterson’s
meaningful impact on the City of Wyandotte
and serves as tribute to his leadership as a
police officer, councilman, and mayor.
Throughout all his work, Peterson has dis-

out seeking praise or recognition for any of his
significant accomplishments.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me today in celebrating the dedication of the
Joseph R. Peterson Justice Building. Joseph
Peterson has become a pillar of our commu-
nity, and the naming of the new Joseph R.
Peterson Justice Building serves as a testa-
ment to his important work. We are all grateful
for Peterson’s leadership and wish him contin-
ued success in the years ahead.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE
OF AMARJIT SINGH BUTTAR
HON. JOE COURTNEY
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to observe and mourn the passing of an
extraordinary American, Mr. Amarjit Singh
Buttar of Vernon, Connecticut. Amarjit passed
away surrounded by his loving family in Con-
necticut on Wednesday, November 20, 2019.
His life was a quintessential American story.
Born in 1938 in the Punjab region of India, he
was raised as a disciple of the Sikh religion.
In 1965, he emigrated to the United States
with his wife, Rajinder Kaur Thind, and imme-
diately embarked on an epic, relentless effort
to contribute and succeed in his new home-
land. He was accepted to University of Michi-
gan Law School in 1966 and after graduation
used his degree to pursue a lifetime of work
helping fellow citizens in need. He moved to
Connecticut with Rajinder, his two sons,
Gursimrit Singh Buttar and Angad Singh
Buttar, and began a career applying his legal
acumen at the State of Connecticut Workers
Compensation Commission. This agency adju-
dicates all the work-related injury claims in the
state, affecting thousands and thousands of
on-the-job accidents and illnesses that can re-
sult in tremendous stress and hardship if not
handled correctly. Amarjit assisted the quasi-
judicial state Commissioners in the handling of
claims, demonstrating total command of the
law and its processes. His innate compassion
for people was a huge help to workers and
their families who often found the system frus-
trating and daunting. As a young lawyer who
represented workers compensation clients
years ago, I personally saw him in action,
deftly resolving complex cases and issues be-
fore the Commissioners even needed to rule.
His diligence and competence were respected
and admired by all who came into contact with
him.
Amarjit’s other best known public service
was his passionate dedication to our country’s
democracy. He valued the right to vote, to par-
ticipate in elections, and to run for office. In
Vernon, where we both lived, Amarjit and I
met a long time ago as members of the local
Democratic Town Committee, and in every
election, whether at the local level or for the
U.S. Presidency, he was a stalwart volunteer
showing up at every meeting, phone bank, ‘‘lit-
erature drop’’, or election night gathering to
support the candidates. Sometimes I bene-
fitted from his help, when I ran for State Rep-
resentative from 1986 to 1992, and later for
U.S. Congress 2006 to the present. But also
Amarjit himself benefitted when he success-
fully ran for the Vernon School Board, where
he served two terms, including a stint as
Chair.
When he was first elected in 2001, it was an
exciting moment, since he was the first Sikh-
American in Connecticut to achieve the mile-
stone of elective office and one of the first na-
tionwide. It’s important to note that as strong
a Democrat as Amarjit was, in office he dem-
onstrated total respect and comity for his Re-
publican colleagues and was always focused
on advancing the best interests of the school
children of the town, not a partisan agenda.
His other notable electoral highlight was when
he was selected as a delegate to the Demo-
cratic National Convention in 2004 in Boston,
Massachusetts. There, he witnessed in person
Barack Obama’s famous keynote address, a
20-minute speech that introduced him to the
country, and that began his journey to the
White House in 2008.
As busy as Amarjit was with his public serv-
ice, he always found time for his family. They
are a close-knit group, sharing time and activi-
ties (including volunteering at Democratic
Headquarters). In August of this year his fam-
ily celebrated 50 years of marriage to
Rajinder. Amarjit was also intensely devoted
to his two sons. His son Angad shared a story
of his dad’s devotion: ‘‘Though not a sports
fan himself, he raised two sons who are avid
fans. When he would take his oldest son to
Hartford Whalers games when he was a child,
he would playfully cheer for the opposing
teams such as the rival Boston Bruins or the
Montreal Canadiens, while his son would vig-
orously cheer for the hometown team.’’
Madam Speaker, showing your playful love of
your children in the middle of hostile hockey
fans I believe is the ultimate proof of familial
devotion! Both boys today are now grown and
graduates of the University of Connecticut,
pursuing successful careers—Gursimrit in New
York and Angad in Virginia where he lives with
his wife, Simmi Bhuller. Amarjit also found
time for his fellow Sikh community in Con-
necticut and across the country. My casework
staff in Connecticut can amply attest to his
high volume of calls, asking for assistance for
his many many friends—which we always wel-
comed.
Madam Speaker, I believe Amarjit’s life can
be summed up with a simple phrase: ‘‘He
made a difference.’’ For his family, his Sikh
community, his Vernon community and his
American community, Amarjit created a trans-
formational legacy that touched thousands of
lives, for the better. That is a proud legacy,
and I ask that the entire House join me in ex-
pressing our deepest condolences to his fam-
ily and saluting his groundbreaking life.
RECOGNIZING JANYCE ‘‘JAN’’
HEDETNIEMI
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, it is with
a heavy heart that I rise to announce the
passing of a titan in Fairfax County, Janyce
‘‘Jan’’ Hedetniemi. I had the great privilege of
knowing and working with Jan for many years
and I was proud to call her a friend.
Jan was born and grew up in Sewickley,
Pennsylvania and received her bachelor’s de-
gree in psychology and English literature from
the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now
Carnegie Mellon University) followed by her
master’s degree in psychology and counseling
and guidance from Indiana University in 1963.
She moved to the Washington, D.C. area
where she served in the early part of her ca-
reer as assistant dean of women at the Uni-
versity of Maryland and director of develop-
ment at Mount Vernon College.
Jan embarked on a long and illustrious ca-
reer of Federal public service, first as a social
science analyst with the President’s Bio-
medical Research Panel and thereafter in a
series of progressively responsible positions at
the National Institutes of Health in program
planning and development initiatives, including
the NIH Research Agenda on Women’s Health
and the National Action Plan on Breast Can-
cer. She was appointed in 1994 as the first di-
rector of the NIH’s newly established Office of
Community Liaison, serving in that position
until her retirement from the NIH in 2002.
Jan’s service there was recognized with two
NIH Director’s Awards.
Jan had an unquenchable passion for com-
munity service and civic leadership. She
served as president of her homeowner’s asso-
ciation for many years and as co-chair of the
Braddock District Democratic Committee from
2009 to 2013. She served as a member of the
Boards of the Fairfax County Park Authority
and Park Foundation and was appointed to
the Planning Commission where she served
from 2013 to 2017. Jan also chaired the Fair-
fax County Transportation Advisory Committee
and four separate Bond Referendum Commit-
tees. In recognition of her countless contribu-
tions and dedication to our community, Jan
was named the Board of Supervisors’ Lady
Fairfax for the Braddock District in 2004, Brad-
dock District Member of the Year for 2013,
and the 2014 Citizen of the Year by the Fair-
fax County Federation of Citizens Associa-
tions.
Jan was also an avid outdoors sports-
woman, both as a tennis player and as an
equestrian. She served as captain of two
United Tennis Association Adult Women’s
Teams. As a horse owner, she participated for
many years in dressage training and competi-
tion and served as a member of the Fairfax
County Equestrian Services Task Force.
Jan was loved by many and respected by
all. I was proud to name her to serve as Presi-
dential Elector of the 2012 Electoral College
from the 11th Congressional District of Virginia
for the re-election of President Barack Obama.
Her service to her community and country is
expansive and commendable and her pres-
ence will be deeply missed.

RECOGNIZING THE 30TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF SOS INTERNATIONAL
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize SOS International LLC (SOSi) on
the occasion of its 30th anniversary. Founded
in 1989 to provide specialized analytical serv-
ices to the U.S. law enforcement community,
SOSi has evolved into an international solu-
tions provider with experience in 30 countries
worldwide. SOSi provides intelligence, tech-
nology and project-management solutions to
large, government and private-sector organiza-
tions and is known for its innovation, flexibility
and agility. SOSi is among the fastest growing
companies in the Aerospace and Defense
Services industry. The company has been rec-
ognized by Washington Technology magazine
as one of the Top 100 Government Tech-
nology Contractors for 2019; and it was nomi-
nated by the Northern Virginia Chamber of
Commerce for this year’s Large Business
Contractor and Executive of the Year Awards.
What has struck me most about SOSi is not
only its impressive growth and development
as a company, but its continued commitment
to our Northern Virginia community. SOSi is
an ardent supporter of our Nation’s active duty
military and veteran population. Veterans
make up 25 percent of SOSi’s global work-
force. SOSi is a Virginia Values Veterans (V3)
certified company. It is an active supporter of
the local USO chapter, as well as a number of
organizations like Bunker Labs, Capitol Post,
and Dog Tag Inc. that empower veterans, mili-
tary spouses, and caregivers to pursue their
entrepreneurial aspirations.
SOSi is equally committed to improving the
lives of underprivileged and underserved peo-
ple in our local community. They’ve been huge
supporters of Cornerstones, a non-profit in
Northern Virginia which provides critical sup-
port to those in need of food, shelter, afford-
able housing, quality childcare, and other
human services.
Earlier this year, SOSi President and CEO
Julian Setian served as chairman for Corner-
stones’ Best of Reston Gala, which I attend al-
most every year. That gala raised over
$500,000 for individuals and families who are
in need in our community. Every year, SOSi
holds drives for coats, books and school sup-
plies, benefiting the families in Cornerstones’
shelters. SOSi employees cook Thanksgiving
meals, build bookshelves, pack care pack-
ages, and sponsor a ‘‘night out at the movies’’
for children living in their shelters. SOSi em-
ployees participate in South Lakes High
School’s annual Ethics Day event, mentoring
young people in Northern Virginia about the
value of ethical conduct in their daily lives.
SOSi is also a strong advocate for immi-
grants who are victims of human trafficking
and domestic violence through its support for
a Washington D,C. based organization called
Ayuda. SOSi provides free translation services
and life coaching to this often overlooked seg-
ment of our community. Lastly, the company
has become active in causes, such as Chance
For Life, which raises money for pediatric can-
cer research, and the Wolf Trap Foundation
for the Performing Arts, to which Julian and
SOSi have become active contributors.
Through their involvement in Wolf Trap, they
provide critical support to early youth edu-
cation in music and art.
Madam Speaker, companies like SOSi and
the employees who work there are proof of
the commitment to public service that exists
throughout Northern Virginia. l ask my col-
leagues to join me in thanking all of the em-
ployees and leadership of SOSi for their ef-
forts to better our community and protect our
country. I especially want to commend Julian
for his leadership and vision. Under his guid-
ance, SOSi has continued to grow and has
become the standard bearer for progress and
innovation in the government contracting in-
dustry. I thank them for their service and wish
the SOSi Team continued success.

OFFICER LEO LOPEZ RETIRES
FROM THE CALIFORNIA HIGH-
WAY PATROL
HON. PAUL COOK
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the outstanding law enforcement ca-
reer of California Highway Patrol Officer Leo
Lopez, who will retire after 30 years of service.
Officer Lopez’s promise to serve by the
California Highway Patrol motto of ‘‘Safety,
Service, and Security’’ began prior to his grad-
uation from the academy. The Loma Prieta
earthquake that struck the Bay Area caused
officer Lopez to dive right into duties, driving
patrol units from Sacramento to the San Fran-
cisco CHIP office on only his second day of
the academy. Officer Lopez went on to receive
badge #12972 on March 8, 1990, with his first
station assignment in Barstow. He has since
served in numerous capacities with the Inland
Division Commercial Unit and the Inland Divi-
sions Special Response Team. One of many
of his deployments was to assist with the
aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, I offer my sincere congratulations to Offi-
cer Leo Lopez for his 30 years of service as
a member of the California Highway Patrol
and wish him an enjoyable and relaxing retire-
ment. A native to the High Desert and the sec-
ond of three generations to serve the Cali-

HON. XOCHITL TORRES SMALL

Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico.
Madam Speaker, this November, I am proud
to join my colleague, Congresswoman DEB
HAALAND in recognizing Native American Herit-
age Month. This House Resolution draws at-
tention to our country’s complex history and
celebrates the many contributions Native
Americans have made to our nation. Impor-

government-to-government relationship with
nations, tribes and pueblos and highlights
challenges Congress must address. With this
responsibility, I recognize that Congress must
respect and value the sovereign governments
that have long called New Mexico home be-
fore I was privileged to represent it.
Indian Country plays a critical role in our
country’s history, and too often these stories
are not told. By designating November as Na-
tive American Heritage Month, we can collec-
tively reflect on our nation’s past and pay trib-
ute. We owe it to those who came before us—
and those to come—to tell the full truth about
our nation’s history and uplift voices that have
been systematically suppressed: Most re-
cently, I joined members of the Acoma Pueblo
in celebrating a long overdue return of a sa-
cred, ceremonial shield. After nearly four years
of public appeals, a sacred piece that dis-
appeared in the 1970s was rightfully returned
to the Acoma Pueblo. Sadly, this is not an iso-
lated event. The illegal acquisition and sale of
sensitive Native American items is wide-
spread, and I am committed to working with
tribes to end the export of unlawfully removed
items and return them home.
In addition to fighting to preserve the culture
and traditions of the pueblos and tribes in
southern New Mexico, we must recognize our
responsibility to ensure Native communities
are provided with the proper support to build
a better future. It’s why this year I supported
advanced appropriations for the Indian Health
Service (IHS) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs
(BIA) to grant stability to Tribal programs and
ensuring that Tribal Governments are not neg-
atively affected by impasses in the federal ap-
propriations process. I was also proud to sup-
port the passage of the reauthorization of the
Violence Against Women Act and the addi-
tional protections added this year for Native
women. Lastly, I worked with my Republican
colleague Rep. DUSTY JOHNSON to fight for full
funding for the New Beginnings for Tribal Stu-
dents Program, which provides competitive
grant funding for Land Grant institutions that
are actively seeking to increase recruitment,
retention, and graduation rates for Native
American students.
As a Representative for southern New Mex-
ico, I have the privilege of representing many
tribes and pueblo communities. I know first-
hand that our state’s past, present, and future
is tied to the vibrancy of its Native American
communities. Native American Heritage Month
is an important step towards fulfilling the trust
and responsibility owed to our Native Amer-
ican sovereign governments. I am proud to
join my colleagues, Reps. DEB HAALAND (NM–
01), TOM COLE (OK–4), SHARICE DAVIDS (KS–
3), RUBEN GALLEGO (AZ–7), RAÚL M. GRIJALVA

THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE
KENAN-FLAGLER BUSINESS
SCHOOL, UNC-CHAPEL HILL
HON. DAVID E. PRICE
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th
Anniversary of the University of North Caro-
lina’s Kenan-Flagler Business School. Over
the course of the last century, Kenan-Flagler
has set a high standard for business edu-
cation, becoming one of the top ranked busi-
ness schools in the country.
Originally founded as the School of Com-
merce, its doors were opened in 1919 with a
class of only 12 students. The school contin-
ued to grow: the first Ph.D. was awarded in
1928 and the MBA and executive programs
were introduced in 1952. Now, 100 years
later, Kenan-Flagler graduates more than
3,000 students every year, ranging from un-
dergraduate to Ph.D.s.
Kenan-Flagler is constantly evolving and im-
proving the way it teaches the next generation
of business leaders. For example, the school
has shifted its teaching model to focus on un-
derstanding the contours of international busi-
ness. By offering immersive study abroad and
international internship opportunities, the
school reaffirms its commitment to global edu-
cation. Additionally, through the UNC-IDB
Strategic Studies Fellows Program, Kenan-
Flagler partners with the Institute for Defense
and Business to educate Defense Department
and national security professionals about the
foundations of national security through a stra-
tegic thinking and innovative lens.
While not every student studies abroad,
Kenan-Flagler finds alternative ways to bring
the global experience into the classroom. Last
year, with the use of virtual reality goggles,
students were transported to a boardroom in
the central African country of Cameroon.
Kenan-Flagler pushes the envelope on tradi-
tional teaching methods, serving as an exam-
ple for professional schools across the world.
Kenan-Flagler’s commitment to global edu-
cation and diversity go hand in hand. With
over 37,000 living alumni spanning 86 coun-
tries, the impact of the Kenan-Flagler Busi-
ness School is evident all over the globe. In
1973, the school became the first southern in-
stitution and sixth nationwide to join the Con-
sortium for Graduate Study in Management, a
network of universities committed to providing
minority populations the education and tools
needed to succeed in business and industry.
This dual commitment is symbolized by the
multitude of flags greeting you upon entrance
into the McColl Building, which houses the
business school on campus. These flags rep-
resent the many different nationalities of
Kenan-Flagler students and the affinity groups
represented by the community.
Madam Speaker, as an alumnus of the Uni-
versity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I am
immensely proud of the Kenan-Flagler Busi-
ness School’s commitment to the future gen-
erations of business leaders. I ask my col-
leagues to join me in congratulating Dean
Douglas Shackelford, the entire leadership,
and the student body of Kenan-Flagler on this
momentous anniversary.

paper the Southeast Missourian. For my whole
life—literally—Mark has been a stoic reporter
of news both local and national, and our com-
munity has been made better off by his work.
I was fortunate to work with Mark as he re-
ported on politics in Missouri and Washington,
DC. He accompanied me to many farm visits
and trips to local businesses, and I knew to
expect his call when issues affecting our coun-
try arose. At every meeting, his sharp thinking
and dogged determination to find the best
story for his readers was apparent, and he
challenged me to work harder, ask more ques-
tions, and match his incredible tenacity and
enthusiasm for the people around us.
Before he ever shook my hand or typed my
name in one of his columns, however, I, and
many in our community, knew him intimately.
He tempered his no-nonsense reporting of the
news with a tender, emotional, humorous
weekly column titled ‘‘Mark My Word,’’ which
touched on topics including politics, business,
family, and food—in one word: life. He intro-
duced himself to readers at the same time as
he informed them about the goings-on of their
town, state, and world.
Mark’s reporting is a perfect example of why
a healthy, local press is essential to the flour-
ishing of any community. Because of Mark’s
natural inquisitiveness and wealth of historical
knowledge, his columns put events in context
and made them matter to his community. He
not only reported on current events but under-
stood them, and he was able to report the
news in a way that helped his readers under-
stand them as well. At a time when it felt as
if a different local paper was closing every
other month, Mark reminded us of what local
news could and should be—and why it is so
important to support these vital organizations.
For this reason and many others, I am sad to
see him retire, but I am thankful for the long
record of service he leaves behind.

HONORING THE PARNAGIAN
FAMILY
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the Parnagian family as they are
honored at the 2019 Fresno State Ag One
Foundation Community Salute for their con-
tributions to the Central Valley and California
agriculture. The Parnagians are champions in
our Valley and have played an integral role in
transforming California agriculture for the 21st
century.
The legacy of the Parnagian family began in
1943, when Gladys Girazian, a lieutenant in
the United States Navy Nursing Corps, met a
young Marine, Sam Parnagian, at the San
Diego Naval Hospital. Sam, a World War II
veteran, had just returned from Pearl Harbor.
Just two weeks later, the couple knew they
were meant for each other and were married
on December 2, 1943. The couple were
blessed with four sons, Dennis, Kenneth,
Randy, and Philip.
In 1950, Sam established Fowler Packing
Company in Fowler, California. With Sam at
the helm, the help of his four sons, younger
brother Pete and nephew Jim, Fowler Packing
quickly found success. Today, the family fruit
farms and state-of-the-art packing facilities
have grown into one of the largest packers
and shippers of tree fruit, citrus and table
grapes in the industry. Sam was involved in
the day-to-day operations of the business until
his passing in 1980. Thereafter, Sam’s four
sons held executive roles in the company and
managed day-to-day operations. After 40
years of success, the Parnagian brothers
passed along leadership responsibilities to
Justin and Leland Parnagian in 2017, making
the way for the third-generation.
The family places an emphasis on social re-
sponsibility and creating a welcoming work en-
vironment. They have an on-site cafeteria,
with free meals provided daily to their employ-
ees. Additionally, they have added a health
clinic at their headquarters and offer free
healthcare and medications for employees and
their families. They have also established the
Fowler Packing Scholars Program to help
bring the dream of a college education for
their employees’ children closer to reality. The
Parnagians stay hue to their commitment to
excellence as they put the best interests of
customers, growers and employees first.
The Parnagian family holds core values of
family, honor and strong work ethic. They
have always been generous with the commu-
nity. In 2015, the Parnagian family made a
$1.5 million-dollar gift to Valley Children’s
Healthcare, establishing the Sam and Gladys
Parnagian Child Life Endowment. Additionally,
Fowler Packing has been a longtime supporter
of the Community Food Banks.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in congratulating the Parnagian family for
their contributions and exemplified leadership
in the Central Valley. I wish the Parnagian
family continued health, happiness and pros-
perity.

NATIONAL DIABETES AWARENESS
MONTH
HON. MAXINE WATERS
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I am proud
to join the American Diabetes Association and
millions of doctors, nurses, health profes-
sionals, and concerned Americans to recog-
nize American Diabetes Month.
Diabetes remains the seventh leading cause
of death in the United States. It effects more
than 30 million Americans—seven million of
whom are undiagnosed. By the end of this
year, more than 40,000 people will be diag-
nosed with Type 1 diabetes—which is identi-
fied as the body’s inability to produce insulin.
Type 2 diabetes—which indicates a deficiency
in the way the body uses insulin—remains the
most common form of diabetes, and makes up
more than 90 percent of all diabetes cases. In
addition, 10 percent of all women develop
gestational diabetes during pregnancy, which
blocks a mother’s ability to use insulin and can
complicate the health of both the mother and
the baby. Without proper treatment, diabetes
can lead to serious and sometimes deadly
complications, including heart disease, nerve
damage, blindness, lower limb amputations,
kidney failure, high blood pressure, and even
stroke.
In my home state of California, more than 4
million people—approximately 13 percent of
the adult population in our state—have diabe-
tes. What’s worse, more than 1 million Califor-
nians have diabetes, but have not been tested
and are unaware that they are living with the
disease. An astounding 10 million Californians
have prediabetes, which is a health condition
where blood sugar levels are higher than nor-
mal, but are not high enough to be diagnosed
as Type 2 diabetes. By the end of this year,
263,000 residents of our state will be newly di-
agnosed with diabetes.
The troubling increase in the number of
Americans living with diagnosed diabetes has
also increased the overall economic costs of
treating the disease. According to a 2018
American Diabetes Association report, in 2017
the cost for treating diabetes was an astound-
ing $327 billion. Americans diagnosed with di-
abetes had medical expenses that were 2.3
times higher than Americans without diabetes,
and spent, on average, $9,600 on healthcare
expenditures. That same report found that in
the state of California, the overall cost of med-
ical expenses and treatment of diabetes was
$27 billion.
For minority communities around the coun-
try, the risk of developing diabetes or suffering
from complications of the disease is devastat-
ingly heightened. Diabetes effects 15 percent
of American Indians and Alaska natives, 13
percent of African Americans, 12 percent of
Hispanics, and 8 percent of Asian Americans.
Though they are most impacted and at risk of
developing diabetes, it’s no secret that minori-
ties often lack access to quality health care,
are more likely to have prediabetes, are more
likely to suffer from complications of diabetes,
and in some cases, are nearly twice as likely
to die from diabetes.
To this end, for many years, I have proudly
authored and fought for support of H.R. 4550,
the Minority Diabetes Initiative Act, which is
supported by the American Diabetes Associa-
tion and 60 of my House colleagues and fel-
low members of the Congressional Diabetes
Caucus. My bill will provide grants to physi-
cians and community-based organizations for
diabetes prevention, care, and treatment pro-
grams in minority communities. It will also pro-
vide grants for a variety of diabetes-related
health services, including public education on
diabetes prevention and control, routine health
care for diabetic patients, eye care, foot care,
and treatment for kidney disease and other
complications of diabetes.
I am also a strong supporter of increased
federal funding for diabetes programs at the
National Institutes of Health and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, and have
supported many legislative measures that en-
sure that Americans living with diabetes have
the quality and affordable healthcare they de-
serve.
During American Diabetes Month, and every
month, we must continue to raise awareness
of this disease and show our strong support
for research, innovations, and healthcare serv-
ices that improve the lives of the millions of
Americans who are living with or at-risk of
being diagnosed with this disease. Diabetes
will continue to ravage our communities and
lead to the premature death of Americans if
we fail to act. While both genetic and environ-
mental factors can contribute to the develop-
ment of diabetes, it is imperative that every
American regardless of their age, race, or ge-
ographic location get tested for diabetes, and
speak with their doctors about actions they

I thank the millions of doctors, nurses,
health professionals, and concerned Ameri-
cans who are engaged in the fight against dia-
betes, and I am proud to continue to join with
my colleagues in the Congressional Diabetes
Caucus to do all that we can to develop and
pass legislation that will aid in the treatment
and prevention of this disease. Americans
must get tested, get informed, and spread the
word about the dangers of diabetes. The
sooner we know, the sooner we can act to
prevent or postpone the impact of this dis-
ease.

RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF HIDDEN OAKS NATURE
CENTER
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the Fairfax County Park Authority
and the staff and volunteers of Hidden Oaks
Nature Center on the occasion of the Center’s
50th anniversary.
Founded in 1969, Hidden Oaks Nature Cen-
ter has become an invaluable part of the An-
nandale Community Park and serves as an
example of Fairfax County’s ongoing commit-
ment to the preservation of our natural envi-
ronment. The Center offers a variety of pro-
grams and activities designed to promote the
engagement of the public with their sur-
rounding environment including live animal
displays and a trail network featuring ponds,
creeks, woodland and a rain garden. Hidden
Oaks Nature Center also offers programs
throughout the year to teach children and fam-
ilies about nature, including summer camps,
tea parties, campfires, and animal feedings.
This rich bounty of natural resources has
led to Hidden Oaks Nature Center becoming a
staging location for community groups looking
to assist with connecting the community with
the natural world. One of the key partners has
been the Boy Scouts, who use the Center for
hundreds of hours of merit badge classes
each year, as well as for support for Eagle
Scout projects. Fairfax County’s Environmental
Quality Advisory Council, the citizen volunteer
group charged with advising the Board of Su-
pervisors on environmental matters, holds
their monthly meetings at Hidden Oaks. These
meeting are open to the public, providing an-
other avenue for Hidden Oaks to continue its
important mission.
The efforts of the staff and volunteers at
Hidden Oaks have produced significant re-
sults. Chief among these is the designation of
the greater Mason District as the fourth-largest
certified Community Wildlife Habitat in the
United States by the National Wildlife Federa-
tion. As Fairfax County continues to grow, with
a population now exceeding 1 million, the con-
tinued preservation of our natural capital will
only become more important. Even in the
midst of the concrete jungles of New York
City, the architects of that metropolis knew
that it was critical for the wellbeing of the city’s
residents to have access to green space. The
same is true for Fairfax County and the work
done by the staff and volunteers at Hidden
Oaks Nature Center helps to ensure that the
environment remains a priority for our commu-
nity. This prioritization of nature and of access
to green space is one of the many reasons
why Fairfax County residents continues to
enjoy such a high quality of life.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues
join me in once again congratulating the Fair-
fax County Park Authority and the staff and
volunteers of Hidden Oaks Nature Center for
their continued stewardship of our natural en-
vironment. The fact that this stewardship has
continued unabated for half a century is a tes-
tament to the impact that Hidden Oaks Nature
Center has had on our local community and
how deeply it is valued as a resource. I thank
them for their service to our community and
wish them continued success in all their future
endeavors.

IN MEMORY OF CAPTAIN JOSEPH
C. MCCONNELL, JR.
HON. PAUL COOK
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize and honor the life of United States
Air Force Captain Joseph C. McConnell, Jr.
Before his tragic death in a flight-testing acci-
dent, Captain McConnell served his country in
both World War II and the Korean War, where
he was a triple jet ace and still holds the
American record for most jet kills.
Captain McConnell entered the U.S. Army
Air Forces in 1943 during World War II; flying
60 combat missions in Europe as a B–24 Lib-
erator navigator. Following the war, he went
on to earn his pilot wings in 1948 and subse-
quently fought in the Korean War. Captain
McConnell served as a pilot with the 39th
Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 51st Fighter-In-
terceptor Wing, Fifth Air Force and was sta-
tioned at George Air Force Base in Victorville
before being assigned to K13 in the Republic
of Korea. Within four months, Capt. McConnell
had shot down 16 enemy fighter jets, becom-
ing the leading jet ace of the Korean War and
the first triple jet ace in American history. ‘‘For
his extraordinary heroism in connection with
military operations’’, President Eisenhower
presented Capt. McConnell with the Distin-
guished Service Cross, the Nation’s second
highest decoration for valor. On August 25,
1954, Capt. McConnell was killed while serv-
ice testing the newer, more powerful F–86H
Sabre at George Air Force Base.
Captain McConnell’s skill and daring over
foreign battlefields in defense of our nation
was unmatched during the Korean War. Al-
though he was tragically taken from this earth
far too early, his spirit lives on in the dedica-
tion and professionalism of the men and
women of the United States Air Force that
continue to follow in his footsteps today.

HONORING MRS. LILLIAN AUDREY
SEAYS
HON. VAL BUTLER DEMINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life of someone I consid-
ered my sister and friend, Mrs. Lillian Audrey
Seays, who passed away on November 20,
2019, three days before seeing her 82nd birth-
day.
Always a champion for reading and edu-
cation, Lillian served for 22 years as the librar-
ian at Memorial Middle School. The Orlando
community could not have been prouder when
in 2016, the Media Center was renamed in her
honor .
Lillian Seays had a mission in life, and it ex-
tended well beyond her commitment to the
youth of Central Florida. Lillian understood the
importance of educating other cultures about
the accomplishments and challenges of Afri-
can Americans throughout Florida. In 1997,
she and her husband, Lester Seays, co-found-
ed ONYX Magazine, through their own pub-
lishing company, LBS Publications. Rooted in
strong tradition, style and grace, ONYX Maga-
zine continues to be a premier magazine that
empowers, entertains and inspires persons of
diverse backgrounds from around the world.
The LBS Foundation has awarded thousands
of dollars in scholarship to deserving youth.
Lillian Seays was actively involved in her
community where she served as a charter
member of the Orange County Chapter of
Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., President
and Treasurer of the Orlando Alumnae Chap-
ter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. Under
her leadership, Orlando experienced several
‘‘firsts,’’ including the first sickle cell screening
clinic, health fair, Minerva Awards, and the
very first and unforgettable Ebony Fashion
Fair Show. Please note that the Ebony Fash-
ion Fair Show raised thousands of dollars for
scholarships. In addition, Lillian led the initia-
tive to develop the Delteens of Orlando, now
known as the Delta Gems, a mentoring group
for young women.
Moreover, Lillian Seays was a member of
the Links, Inc., publisher and co-author of
Jack and Jill of America, Inc., and an active
member of New Covenant Baptist Church.
Lillian Seays was a true public servant who
never forgot that service to humankind was a
direct reflection of her service to God. We truly
believe Central Florida is better, stronger and
kinder because of her unselfish love for her
community.
Madam Speaker, Mrs. Lillian Seays will be
missed by all who knew her, but we are for-
ever grateful for her service, and join her fam-
ily and the Orlando community in celebrating
a life well lived.

RECOGNIZING THE FAIRFAX
COUNTY HISTORY COMMISSION
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the Fairfax County History Commis-
sion on the occasion of the 15th Annual Fair-
fax County History Conference.
This year also marks the 50th anniversary
of the Fairfax County History Commission.
Since 1969, the History Commission has
worked to identify, document, record and pre-
serve the historic past of our region. Few
areas in the country are as rich in history as
ours. Indeed, the history of this region is the
history of our country. The History Conference
provides an opportunity to reflect on the ac-
complishments of the past year and to recog-
nize our neighbors who have made significant
contributions to preserving and promoting our
local history. Through the dedicated efforts of
the History Commission and its many volun-
teers, we are assured that our history will not
be lost and will be available for future genera-
tions.
This year, several of these dedicated indi-
viduals are being honored for their commit-
ment to the preservation and education of his-
tory. I am proud to include their names in the
RECORD:
Mr. Brian Conley, for his 32 years of pas-
sionate and professional oversight, manage-
ment and preservation of Fairfax County’s his-
toric resources through a variety of positions
within the Fairfax County Library’s Virginia
Room, the County Archives and as County Ar-
chivist.
Ms. Joyce Wilkinson, for her efforts in pro-
moting, preserving, researching and taking
leadership positions to protect the historic re-
sources of Fairfax County and in taking the
initial leadership role as the first Chairperson
of the Fairfax County History Commission.
Mr. Chris Barbuschak, for his efforts in pre-
serving, researching and maintaining the his-
tory of the National Bank of Fairfax Main Of-
fice through this property nomination to the
Fairfax County Inventory of Historic Sites.
Ms. Sofia Haile and Ms. Rachel Inman, for
their exemplary work as students of West
Springfield High School’s Applied History class
(taught by Brian Heintz), in preserving, re-
searching, documenting, analyzing and pre-
senting a complete and thorough database of
some 150 Fairfax County Vietnam War sol-
diers who were either listed as dead or miss-
ing in action.
Last, but certainly not least, it gives me
great pleasure to include in the RECORD the
name of my friend and colleague, Sharon
Bulova, who is receiving a Lifetime Achieve-
ment award for her tireless efforts to preserve
and protect the history of Fairfax County. Be-
ginning with her efforts as Braddock District
Supervisor, this passion has continued
throughout her term as Chairman. I was proud
to work with her on a host of these projects,
perhaps most importantly, the purchase of the
Lorton Reformatory and its transformation into
the Workhouse Arts Center. Future genera-
tions will long benefit from her efforts and I
thank her for her dedication.
Madam Speaker, I commend the Fairfax
County History Commission for helping to en-
sure that the abundance of history that is
available to our community will persevere far
into the future. I congratulate all of the hon-
orees and ask my colleagues to join me in
thanking each of them for the important work
they do for the Northern Virginia community.

IN RECOGNITION OF CORPORAL
HENRY KROLL EOR HIS DISTIN-
GUISHED SERVICE
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Corporal Henry Kroll, a
World War II veteran, for his dedicated serv-
ice. His commitment to our country and his
community are worthy of commendation.
Corporal Kroll was born and raised in De-
troit, where he attended Western High School.
In November of 1943, Corporal Kroll was
drafted alongside his two brothers and served
in the artillery for the 106th Infantry Division.
During the war, he fought in the Battle of the
Bulge, where Allied forces repelled a German
offensive in Belgium’s Ardennes forest in De-
cember 1944 and January 1945. Of the 107
men serving in his Division, Corporal Kroll was
one of only seventeen soldiers who survived
the battle. In 1945, Corporal Kroll returned
home on Christmas Day and worked as a mail
carrier for 22 years. Today, Corporal Kroll is
now a father of four and grandfather of nine.
Corporal Kroll has shown a tremendous love
for his country and his community, and his
dedication is finally being recognized. Just be-
fore his 95th birthday, Corporal Kroll received

the World War II Campaign Medal with four
bronze stars, the Army Good Conduct Medal,
and a World War II Victory Medal—awards
that are long overdue. Throughout his years of
service in the United States Military, Corporal
Kroll dutifully earned these honors. He bravely
defended and made sacrifices for our nation to
ensure freedom would persevere for genera-
tions to come.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring Corporal Henry Kroll for his
exemplary service. We are grateful for his
commitment to America, and I am proud that
he is finally receiving the recognition he de-
serves.

REMEMBERING JIM GORDON
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the memory and service of Jim
Gordon, a committed organizer who devoted
over 49 years of his life to fighting for the
American worker.
Jim worked as a building serviceman, in-
staller, switchman, repairman, and systems
technician. While he was committed to his
trade, he knew the importance of collective ac-
tion and quickly became involved in his Com-
munications Workers of America (CWA) local,
serving in several positions including being
elected by his peers to lead CWA Local 9412
as their President. In 1984 Jim joined the staff
of the Communications Workers of America,
serving many years as Legislative/Political Di-
rector for California, Nevada and Hawaii,
headquartered in Sacramento, California. In
that role, he used his deep devotion and expe-
rience to get the best deal for his members
and was awarded the union’s Maxine Lee
Award in 1990 for excellence in his work.
Jim understood the importance of public
service outside of the union serving in the
United States Army in Turkey and as an elect-
ed member of the Fremont City Council. Jim
also served as a member of the California
Democratic Party Central Committee, Chair of
the CDP Labor Caucus, and as the Vice
President of the California Labor Federation,
AFL–CIO.
Jim’s legacy is of a tireless union organizer,
devoting countless hours to fighting on behalf
of American consumers and workers in the
U.S. and abroad. Jim’s service to his country
and work in the labor movement will continue
to help the lives of countless people and his
spirit will be missed. Please join me in cele-
brating his life and his memory.

RECOGNIZING THE 21ST ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE SHEPHERD’S CEN-
TER OF OAKTON-VIENNA
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the Shepherd’s Center of Oakton-
Vienna on the occasion of their 21st anniver-
sary and to thank them for their many con-
tributions to the Northern Virginia community.
Organized in 1998, the Shepherd’s Center of
Oakton-Vienna (SCOV) is a non-profit that
provides services to help older adults continue
living independently, and it offers programs
that supply opportunities for enrichment, learn-
ing, and socialization.
Every year, approximately 200 volunteers
provide invaluable services in support of older
residents who want to age in place in their
homes and stay engaged in social activities.
Services are available free of charge to any-
one age 50 or older who resides in the local
community.
Last year, volunteers provided 9,922 hours
of service to the Northern Virginia community.
Volunteer drivers provided more than 900
round-trip rides for medical needs and other
errands. Volunteers also made regular contact
with individuals who may have limited inter-
action and may feel isolated in their homes.
‘‘Handy Helpers’’ made minor home repairs to
help older adults keep their homes safe and
livable. The Health Team provided individual
health counseling, referral to community re-
sources, and blood pressure readings. Volun-
teers also run programs such as Lunch n’ Life,
Adventures in Learning, trips and outings, spe-
cial events, and caregivers’ support groups.
The services and programs offered by this
extraordinary organization help to ensure that
our seniors stay connected to the community
through the promotion of active lifestyles, on-
going social integration, and availability of re-
sources for older residents to use and share
their experience, training, and skills. In 2014,
SCOV was recognized for these efforts as an
Outstanding Volunteer Caregiving Program by
the National Volunteer Caregiving Network.
I also want to give special mention to a new
series of programs begun by SCOV this year,
focused on veteran outreach. Volunteers from
SCOV who are veterans themselves reach out
to fellow veterans with either a call or an in-
person visit or both. The men and women who
serve our nation in uniform, especially in com-
bat, are just as vulnerable, if not more so, to
the dangers of isolation and depression as our
senior population and I commend SCOV for
taking this important action to help address
that.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues
join me in congratulating the Shepherd’s Cen-
ter of Oakton-Vienna on its 21st anniversary
and for its work to enable older adults in our
community to age in place and enjoy their
golden years with dignity and independence. I
thank the many volunteers who generously
dedicate their time and efforts to the welfare of
our neighbors. The value of their contributions
cannot be overstated and are truly deserving
of our highest praise.

PALMDALE CITY MANAGER JAMES
PURTEE RECIPIENT OF 2019
LARRY CHIMBOLE PUBLIC SERV-
ICE AWARD
HON. PAUL COOK
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Palmdale City Manager James ‘‘Jim’’
Purtee, who will be presented with the Larry
Chimbole Public Service Award by the Cali-
fornia League of Cities Desert/Mountain Divi-
sion. Jim has announced that he will also re-
tire at the end of 2019, after 31 years of public
service.
Jim began his diverse public service career
with the City of Simi Valley in 1988, where he
worked in multiple department and on issues
including community services, affordable hous-
ing, planning, economic development, and city
administration. He was named Simi Valley’s
Assistant City Manager in July 2012 and was
formally appointed to be Palmdale’s City Man-
ager on October 5, 2015. Under his leader-
ship, Palmdale’s Part I crime rate has de-
creased to its lowest in a quarter century.
Palmdale has also maintained a strong gen-
eral fund reserve and credit ratings from both
of the leading ratings agencies, which is a
credit to Jim’s strong and strategic manage-
ment skills. Jim has been very involved with
the League of California Cities, where he has
served as the Desert/Mountain Division’s rep-
resentative to the League’s Administrative
Services Policy Committee and Revenue and
Taxation Policy Committee.
As a former city councilmember, I know that
replacing Jim will be an incredibly tough task
for the City of Palmdale, and I wish their
councilmembers the best of luck in finding a
successor. Jim Puttee embodies all of the
qualities of the Larry Chimbole Award, and I
congratulate him on this prestigious honor as
well as a well-deserved retirement.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE
OF LINDA ORANGE
HON. JOE COURTNEY
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to observe and mourn the passing of
long-time Connecticut State Representative
Linda Orange who passed away on November
20, 2019 after a difficult battle with pancreatic
cancer that she met with bravery and grace,
which characterized her overall approach to
the challenges and vagaries of her life.
At the time of her passing, Linda was in her
23rd year of service as a state representative
in a district that she shared with me in eastern
Connecticut. I can personally attest to her
unstinting focus on advocating for her constitu-
ency in ways both big and small. Whether it
was her committee work, work on the House
floor where she rose to the position of Deputy
Speaker, or taking a call from a constituent at
any time of day, she kept complete and total
fidelity to the people who sent her to the State
Capitol in Hartford.
I had the privilege to see Linda at work at
another time in her life, when she worked in
my Committee room during part of the time I
served at the State Capitol from 1991–1994.
She clerked for me and my colleague then
State Senator Ken Prysbyz when we co-
chaired the Joint Committees on Human Serv-
ices and Public Health. The two of us were a
handful for Linda, partly because of the vol-
ume of the bills that passed through our
doors, but also because the sometimes fre-
netic pace that could make it a real pressure
cooker. To say that we tested her patience at
times is an understatement. Her natural good
humor and kindness always overcame any

drama, though, and after I left the State Cap-
itol she, Ken, and I always had a lot of laughs
reminiscing about that fun time in our lives.
The other special view I had of Linda was
through the eyes of my former District Direc-
tor, the late Jenny Contois, who was Linda’s
closest friend. Jenny was First Selectwoman
in their hometown of Colchester for 15 years
before taking the helm at my district office.
The two of them were inseparable and were
so close they could practically finish each oth-
er’s sentences. Some of their friends nick-
named them ‘‘Laverne and Shirley’’ since the
non-stop banter they engaged in when they
were together resembled the memorable com-
edy duo of sitcom fame. During election sea-
son, when Linda and I shared campaign head-
quarters, Jenny and Linda would hold court in
front of the staff and volunteers, always with
lots of snacks, drinks, and many times even
full meals. It gave the headquarters a special
feel that kept morale high which translated into
a lot of happy successful Election nights.
Jenny sadly passed away four years ago,
which was a terrible loss for many, many fel-
low public officials and townspeople, but it was
extremely hard for Linda. At a difficult time like
this, it is maybe some small consolation to
think that Linda and Jenny are together again,
looking down on us all, with lots of new funny
banter commenting on all of us who knew
them.
Madam Speaker, I would ask the entire
body to join me in expressing our deepest
condolences to Linda’s husband Dennis, and
her entire family for their loss and salute her
inspirational example of a life week lived in the
service of others. I include in the RECORD the
text of her obituary, which perfectly captures
her life and legacy.
CT State Representative Linda Ann
(Smith) Orange, 69, of Colchester, passed
away peacefully at Middlesex Hospital, sur-
rounded by her loving husband, sons, family,
and friends, on November 20, 2019 after a sud-
den and courageous battle with pancreatic
cancer. During this time, she continued to
put family, friends and community first.
Linda’s grace and courage never faltered.
Linda and her family are grateful for the
outpouring of well wishes that brought her
joy and smiles. She never lost her sparkle.
She was born in Hartford, CT on Sep-
tember 25, 1950 to the late Arthur L. and
Anna (Gemeasky) Smith. Linda grew up in
Marlborough and attended RHAM High
School, became a respiratory therapist, and
had a distinctive public service career. Linda
was very dedicated to her two sons and al-
ways active in their lives, especially as they
were growing up. She was very active in
their schools, Boys Scouts, baseball games
and as a second grade catechism teacher. She
served as a member and chair of the
Colchester Board of Assessment Appeals, the
Colchester Police Commission, the East
Haddam Historical Society, and as a corpo-
rator of William W. Backus Hospital. She
also was an honorary member of the
Colchester Hayward Volunteer Fire Com-
pany and a Major in the Connecticut Civil
Air Patrol, Legislative Wing. Linda was an
enthusiastic member of the Colchester
Democratic Town Committee and the
Colchester Democratic Women’s Club which
led to her eventual career at the State Cap-
itol.
In 1991, she became assistant clerk of the
Human Services Committee and later be-
came clerk of the Public Health Committee.
She made many friends and learned the
working of the legislature so well that she
ran as a candidate for State Representative
of the 48th District in 1996. She went on to
serve twelve terms in Hartford, becoming
one of the longest serving members at twen-
ty-three years.
The interests of her constituents were al-
ways her priority without regard for polit-
ical labels. As a legislator, Linda served on
many committees and currently was a mem-
ber of Legislative Management, General Law
and the Public Safety and Security Com-
mittee. She became a knowledgeable author-
ity on public safety issues and the legisla-
ture’s chief advocate for work of first re-
sponders—police, fire fighters, emergency
medical personnel, dispatchers and others.
Linda also was Deputy Speaker and often
presided over the House of Representatives
controlling the process by recognizing mem-
bers wishing to speak, putting all questions
to a vote, and directing the business of the
legislature. While presiding, her charming
personality, ability to add a quip or joke,
and her booming voice endeared her to all
her colleagues on both sides of the aisle.
The staff at the Capitol, the Senators and
Representatives, and all those associated
with the Connecticut General Assembly will
remember Linda for being such a kind and
warm-hearted person, friendly to everyone,
and always ready for a good laugh at herself
or playing a joke on others. Over the years,
Linda was recognized by many organizations
too numerous to mention all. She humbly
accepted such honors and was grateful to
those who appreciated her work.
Some of her distinctions included awards
from the Connecticut Recreation and Parks
Association, the Coalition of Connecticut
Sportsmen, UCONN Advocates, the Mid-
dlesex County and New London County Med-
ical Associations, the Connecticut State Fire
Fighters Association, the Connecticut Coun-
cil of Police Unions, the National Guard As-
sociation, the Eastern Connecticut EMS
Council, Leukemia and Lymphoma Society
and the Association of Connecticut Ambu-
lance Providers. Recently, the charter of the
Uniformed Professional Fire Fighters Asso-
ciation of Connecticut was changed to make
Linda the only life-time honorary member.
Linda was known to end her many encoun-
ters on the phone and in person with: ‘‘Bye,
Bye, Now!’’ Her spirit will live on with her
many friends, using this phrase to remember
her extraordinary life.
Linda is survived by her husband of 43
years, Dennis Orange, Sr.; her son Patrick
Orange and his partner Jennifer Nadeau;
step-son Dennis Orange, Jr., all of
Colchester; step-daughters, Denise and
Darleen O’Neal of Arkansas; her beautiful
grand-daughter, Dezarae Ann Orange, whose
love is everlasting; brothers, Brian and his
wife Linda Smith, of Marlborough, George
and his wife Phyllis, of Windham, ME; god-
daughter, Lorna Smith, of Marlborough; sis-
ters-in-law, Genevieve Lescoe, of Meriden,
and Marion Coriaty, of Willimantic; many
extended family members; and a host of
amazing long-time friends. In addition to her
parents, Linda was predeceased by her son,
Matthew Orange who passed away in 2018 of
pancreatic cancer, her brother Bruce Smith,
parents-in-law William and Rose Orange,
brother-in-law Henry Coriaty, and her sister-
in-law Rosemarie Hart.
RECOGNIZING THE GRADUATION
OF THE FAIRFAX COUNTY FIRE
AND RESCUE DEPARTMENT’S
145TH RECRUIT CLASS
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, November 26, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
congratulate the Fairfax County Fire and Res-
cue Department and the graduates of the
145th Recruit Class. As they prepare to join
the ranks of the Fairfax County Fire and Res-
cue Department, I encourage the 20 grad-
uates to reflect on the history of the depart-
ment and the contributions and dedication of
the brave men and women who have served
before them to protect our community.
The Fairfax County Fire and Rescue De-
partment’s Recruit School consists of an ex-
tensive and demanding 24-week program. In
addition to two weeks of orientation, recruits
completed seven weeks of EMT training and
fifteen weeks of fire suppression training.
Upon graduation, these recruits will be cer-
tified at the level of Firefighter I/II by the Vir-
ginia Department of Fire Programs.
These recruits have the distinct honor of
joining one of the best Fire and Rescue De-
partments in the United States. The efforts of
the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Depart-
ment have been recognized across this coun-
try. Members from the Department serve on
the elite VA Task Force 1, which is among the
first units called to disaster zones to provide
search and rescue support. Members of that
Task Force were recognized by the Inter-
national Association of Fire Chiefs with the
Benjamin Franklin Award for Valor as a result
of their efforts in the aftermath of the dev-
astating earthquakes that struck Nepal in
2015.
They also saw extensive work in Texas,
Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Is-
lands as part of disaster relief and rescue ef-
forts in the aftermaths of Hurricanes Harvey,
Irma and Maria. This summer, the team de-
ployed to the Southeast in support of relief ef-
forts for Hurricane Dorian.
Fairfax County is fortunate to have such ex-
cellent ambassadors for our community and I
commend them for all that they have done to
protect lives and property not only here in
Fairfax County, but around the world. As the
newest members of the Fire and Rescue De-
partment, the 145th Recruit Class graduates
join the department as integral parts of our
community’s emergency response and public
safety team. I am confident that this grad-
uating class will serve the residents of Fairfax
County with honor and distinction. It is my
great honor to include in the RECORD the
names of the 145th Recruit Class:
Adriana Caruso, Sharly Clavel Tobar, Luiz
Costa, Sean Dolan, Lucas Groff, Andrew
Hackett, Jenny Huh, Benjamin Jacobeen, Mat-
