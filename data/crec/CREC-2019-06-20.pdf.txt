MISSING AND MURDERED
INDIGENOUS WOMEN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to speak on a crisis that af-
fects communities across our Nation.
That crisis is that of missing and mur-
dered indigenous women.
Native American and Alaska Native
women throughout the country face a
murder rate 10 times that of the na-
tional average, with 84 percent experi-
encing some kind of violence in their
lifetime.
In my home State of Washington, Na-
tive Americans make up about 2 per-
cent of the population, but a recent re-
port by the Washington State Patrol
shows that indigenous women account
for 7 percent of the State’s reported
missing women.
My congressional district in Central
Washington sits at the epicenter of this
crisis. In the past 5 years alone, seven
women have been murdered or have
gone missing on or near the Yakama
Nation reservation.
These women are not just statistics
in a database. They are mothers,
daughters, sisters, neighbors, and
friends. There are those who are miss-
ing, like 25-year-old Alillia Minthorn,
or Lala as her friends called her, who
was last seen in Toppenish and has
been missing since May 5; 31-year-old
Rosenda Strong, who was last seen in
Wapato on October 2 of last year;
34-year-old Freda Gun, who went miss-
ing in Kennewick in 2016; and 18-year-
old Rosalita Longee, who was last seen
in Wapato in 2015.
Then there are the unsolved murders,
including 23-year-old Linda Dave,
whose remains were found in Toppenish
in February of 2017; 31-year-old Minnie
Andy, who was assaulted by an un-
known assailant in Wapato, and later
died of her injuries in July of 2017; and
23-year-old Destiny Lloyd, who was re-
ported missing on Christmas Day 2017,
only to be found days later, murdered,
on the side of the road.
To reiterate, Madam Speaker, these
are just seven cases from the last 5
years. There are currently 71 open
cases like this in Washington State; 31
of them occurring on or near the
Yakama Nation reservation.
The local community has been work-
ing to tackle this crisis. Tribal and
community leaders have held multiple
rallies and community forums to raise
awareness and demand action.
The diligent reporting of the Yakima
Herald-Republic has highlighted the
community response and activism on
the ground, creating an online hub to
list open cases involving missing and
murdered Yakama Nation women and
providing resources for the community
to report disappearances.
Recently passed State laws, spear-
headed by State Representative Gina
Mosbrucker in Olympia, have enhanced
data collection and improved commu-
nication between Tribal leaders and
various State agencies.
I absolutely applaud these efforts,
and I am inspired by the progress being
made at the local and State level; how-
ever, this is a national problem that re-
quires a national response. That is why
I, along with my colleagues, Represent-
atives TORRES and HAALAND, intro-
duced Savanna’s Act.
Our legislation aims to address and
bring awareness to the crisis of missing
and murdered indigenous women at the
Federal level by improving coordina-
tion between Federal, State, local, and
Tribal law enforcement agencies. The
bill would develop guidelines and best
practices for Tribes and law enforce-
ment agencies across the country to
enhance the reporting and record-
keeping of crimes against indigenous
women and improve communication
between law enforcement and families
of victims.
Now, this bill may sound familiar.
Last Congress, the Senate unanimously
passed a version of Savanna’s Act that
stalled in the House. Representatives
TORRES, HAALAND, and I worked with
Tribes, advocacy groups, law enforce-
ment, and Senators MURKOWSKI and
CORTEZ MASTO to improve the legisla-
tion and introduce a bill that can—and
should—be signed into law.
The bill is named in honor of Sa-
vanna LaFontaine-Greywind, a 22-year-
old member of the Spirit Lake Tribe,
pregnant with her first child, who was
murdered in August of 2017. Her murder

brought long-overdue national atten-
tion to missing and murdered indige-
nous women.
After meeting with local families of
victims, State and local law enforce-
ment, and regional Tribes, it has be-
come clear to me that central Wash-
ington has a unique perspective on this
crisis.
The stories about these women are
heartbreaking. It is with these stories
and mine that I have urged both House
Judiciary and Natural Resources Com-
mittees to hold a field hearing on the
Yakama Nation reservation to learn
firsthand how this crisis is plaguing
our communities.
I am pleased to have gained the sup-
port of local Tribes and the YWCA in
Yakima in calling for a field hearing,
and I am eager to have committee
members hear their stories as well.
Thankfully, justice was served upon
Savanna’s murderers. We owe the same
justice for the many murdered, miss-
ing, indigenous women.

SENIOR COMMUNITY SERVICE EM-
PLOYMENT PROGRAM AND CON-
STITUENT GERALDINE
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma). The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN) for
5 minutes.
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to share with my
colleagues the story of one of my con-
stituents, Geraldine, as a reminder
that the work that we do here on the
floor impacts people’s lives.
Geraldine received assistance from
the Senior Community Service Em-
ployment Program, which is also
known as SCSEP.
We provided $464 million to SCSEP in
the minibus package that we passed
yesterday, H.R. 2740. The bill included
fiscal year 2020 funding for critical pro-
grams at the Department of Labor that
help Americans like Geraldine find jobs
and gain new skills in their journey to
become reemployed, programs like Job
Corps, Registered Apprenticeship,
YouthBuild, and, of course, SCSEP.
Geraldine is a perfect example of why
this funding is so important. She is a
mother and a grandmother and the
main provider for her granddaughter
and two grandchildren.
When the financial crisis of 2008 hit,
she lost her job, a devastating moment
for her family’s only source of income.
She quietly retired, but like far too
many Americans, she did not have
enough savings to stop working.
Her family needed her, and she need-
ed to find work, a task made difficult
with her age, existing skill set, and,
now, gap in employment. Fortunately,
Geraldine was able to take advantage
of SCSEP through Easterseals in New
Jersey.
Created by the Older Americans Act
of 1965, the Senior Community Service
Employment Program has helped low
income, unemployed seniors learn new,
in-demand skills and reenter the work-
force for more than 50 years. Partici-
pants enrolled in SCSEP receive a sub-
sidized minimum wage for work at a
nonprofit agency while learning skills
to help them reenter the workforce.
But SCSEP does more than just
skills training. Its greatest success is
helping seniors regain their sense of
confidence and self-fulfillment. Some
programs have services that help sen-
iors get glasses or even pay rent and
utility bills.
Geraldine shared this with me, that
SCSEP was instrumental in helping
her regain her sense of purpose. She
was so successful in her program, that
she was offered a position at
Easterseals to support new partici-
pants in the program through their
own journeys to reemployment, people
who were previously in the same posi-
tion as she.
Increasingly, seniors like Geraldine
have become the primary caretakers
for their grandchildren. This is espe-
cially true for places that have been
ravaged by the opioid crisis.
That is why it is so important that
we support more programs at SCSEP
at the Department of Labor. There are
countless seniors out there with no-
where to turn. SCSEP is one of the an-
swers that gets them back to work.
Madam Speaker, before I close, I
want to share with you one last anec-
dote from Geraldine.
She shared with me her story about a
boy in her community who didn’t want
to throw away broken crayons. In defi-
ance of his dad, this little boy said
even broken crayons still color just as
brightly as ever. Geraldine says that
she sees herself in broken crayons and
knows that her colors shine just as
brightly as any others.
We must ensure that critical pro-
grams like SCSEP are fully funded as
grandparents across America are in-
creasingly becoming the primary
breadwinners in their families.
I am proud that my colleagues and I
voted to pass H.R. 2740 yesterday, and
as a member of the House Appropria-
tions Subcommittee on Labor, Health
and Human Services, Education, and
Related Agencies, I am committed to
advocating for more programs that
support our seniors.
f
NATIONAL DAIRY MONTH
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, Tuesday morning, I
had the honor of being in Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania, at the State capitol to
speak about my bill, Whole Milk for
Healthy Kids Act. The House Agri-
culture and Rural Affairs Committee
at the State legislature hosted a panel
to discuss my legislation that would
increase milk options in school
lunchrooms across the country.
Later that morning, we gathered in
the capitol rotunda with State law-
makers and representatives of the
dairy industry, dairy farm families
from throughout the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, to rally in support of
putting whole milk back in our
schools.
Madam Speaker, dairy products like
milk contain 9 essential nutrients that
can help reduce your risk of high blood
pressure, osteoporosis, and certain can-
cers. It is helpful with weight manage-
ment. And whether it is protein to help
build and repair muscle tissue of active
bodies or Vitamin A to help maintain
healthy skin, dairy products are a nat-
ural nutrient powerhouse.
I was especially glad to participate in
these events, because June is National
Dairy Month.
Proudly, the Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania is one of the largest milk-pro-
ducing States in the Nation, and this
annual tradition celebrates the con-
tributions the dairy industry and dairy
farm families have made to the world.
It is my hope that, through this legis-
lation, we will be able to allow stu-
dents to select the type of milk that
they love best, including flavored and
whole milk.
This legislation is in response to
changes made in 2010 to the School
Lunch Program. That year, the
Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act amend-
ed the nutrition standards and man-
dated that flavored milk must be fat-
free.
This law, along with the lowest par-
ticipation in the program, led to an
alarming decline in milk consumption
in schools since 2010. Declining milk
consumption in schools not only im-
pacts students where they don’t get the
nutrition that they need, but also the
dairy farm families in rural commu-
nities across the Nation.
In addition to the Whole Milk for
Healthy Kids Act, I recently intro-
duced another bill with Congressman
JOE COURTNEY to expand milk options
for students and reverse the decline of
milk consumption in schools. The
School Milk Nutrition Act of 2019 reaf-
firms and codifies a recent regulation
from the USDA by providing schools
with the option to serve lowfat milk
with flavor, and it requires that milk
offered is consistent with the most re-
cent dietary guidelines for Americans.
In November of 2017, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture announced regu-
latory changes for the National School
Lunch and School Breakfast Programs,
including a provision that provides
schools with the option to serve lowfat
1 percent flavored milk.
b 0915
I urge my colleagues to sign on to
these bills during National Dairy
Month and allow our students the op-
tion of consuming the type of milk
that they love with the nutrition that
they need.
I thank the Pennsylvania lawmakers
and members of the dairy industry who
stood together in Harrisburg on Tues-
day in support of the Whole Milk for
Healthy Kids Act.

Milk is the official beverage of the

with their lunches, should they choose
to enjoy it.
f
ABANDON PLAN FOR ANTI-
IMMIGRANT PUBLIC CHARGE RULE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. LEE) for 5 minutes.
Ms. LEE of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to demand that
the Trump administration stop its as-
sault on immigrant communities and
abandon its plan on public charge.
Now let me be clear: No one should
be denied a visa due to their possible,
potential need for public assistance,
also known as public charge. It is be-
yond appalling that the Department of
Homeland Security is using this cri-
terion to prevent deserving families
from coming to the United States.
This heartless and un-American pro-
posed rule also makes it extremely dif-
ficult for individuals who are seeking a
new life in the United States to receive
a green card if they are considered
likely to use public benefits in the fu-
ture.
If this rule is implemented, the
Trump administration would expand
the list of programs to include SNAP,
Medicaid, and housing assistance to de-
termine permanent residency.
Madam Speaker, basic programs are
there to help struggling families put
food on the table and keep a roof over
their heads when they need it. Denying
immigrant families green card status
with this criterion is just plain wrong.
This anti-immigrant rhetoric is not
new, Madam Speaker. For over 100
years, the Federal Government has
used the argument of public charge in
immigration law for inadmissibility or
deportation. Public charge was first
created when the 47th Congress passed
the Immigration Act of 1882. This re-
stricted certain individuals from mi-
grating to the United States.
This legislation specifically targeted
unmarried women who were presumed
to be a so-called public charge because
employers would not employ them,
leading the government to take care of
them, which is ridiculous.
But it wasn’t just women that this
law targeted. It was also immigrants
from Asia. As many of us are aware,
fear of Chinese laborers was part of the
anti-immigrant rhetoric of the time.
There was widespread fear of the Chi-
nese influence on the economy and the
racist perception that these immi-
grants would not contribute to Amer-
ican society.
This fear was compounded when Chi-
nese immigrants started to bring their
families to America and use public in-
frastructure, such as schools and hos-
pitals.
One of my constituents, Dr. Elaine
Kim, who lives in Berkeley, California,
experienced this discrimination first-
hand. In her own words, she said: ‘‘I am
76, and I am a child of immigrants who
arrived in this country in 1903 and 1926,
respectively. My parents were not al-
lowed by law to become naturalized
citizens and faced very serious racial
discrimination in their lifetimes. But
they both worked hard, harder than
most native-born Americans, all their
lives. They contributed importantly to
the United States and never, ever
caused any legal, social, or economic
problems to anyone in this country.
‘‘At 76, I have also worked hard and
consider myself a model U.S. citizen.
Putting myself through school at a
time when most women, and certainly
most women of color, faced many ob-
stacles, I finally finished a Ph.D. de-
gree. I served the public for 44 years
until I recently retired.
‘‘When I was an impoverished single
mother, I received help from both the
Maternity and Infant Care Project and
unemployment insurance. Now, after
working hard and raising a family of
hardworking, well-educated children, I
receive a modest Social Security check
each month as well as Medicare,
though I have kept myself in good
enough health as to not need much
from this entitlement program.’’
Dr. Kim and her family came to the
United States and contributed greatly
to our Nation. They used public bene-
fits when hardships occurred, but they
paid it back in many ways when they
no longer needed the benefits to help
their family get by.
The Trump administration is trying
to create discriminatory policies that
would restrict families such as Dr.
Kim’s from even entering the country.
This harmful, xenophobic argument
evokes fear and scapegoats immigrant
communities.
Let’s get straight to the facts. This
country was built and continues to
stand on the strength of immigrants.
We know that a little help for our
hardworking immigrant families reaps
exponential returns to our economy
and society.
Immigrants contribute in taxes, and
they should be able to use social serv-
ices when they need it, just like every
other person in our Nation who pays
taxes. Our immigrant community
should not be seen as a drain on Amer-
ica but as an investment in our future.
We are one Nation.
In closing, I want to reiterate that it
is the constitutional duty of Congress
to write our immigration laws and en-
sure that they are equitable to all indi-
viduals, regardless of race, age, or so-
cioeconomic status. That is why, last
week, during the Homeland Security
appropriations markup, I offered an
amendment along with Congressmen
PRICE, POCAN, and AGUILAR that would
make it clear that no Federal funds
can be used to expand public charge.
We must defeat this anti-immigrant
and un-American public charge rule. I
hope that all of my colleagues will
stand up and demand that the adminis-
tration abandon this plan once and for
all.
TANKER ATTACKS DON’T JUSTIFY
U.S. MILITARY ACTION AGAINST
IRAN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Alabama (Mr. BROOKS) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Madam
Speaker, recent Persian Gulf tanker
attacks do not—I repeat, do not—jus-
tify unilateral American military ac-
tion against Iran.
On May 12, 2019, two Saudi Arabian
tankers, a United Arab Emirates tank-
er, and a Norwegian tanker were at-
tacked. According to a Saudi Arabia,
United Arab Emirates, and Norway
joint report, explosions caused all four
vessels to suffer hull breaches.
The report states that limpet mines
were ‘‘highly likely placed by divers
below or at the waterline,’’ and the
placement of the mines was ‘‘con-
sistent with intention to disable the
mobility, but not physically destroy,
each vessel.’’
The report concludes that ‘‘these so-
phisticated attacks were most likely
carried out by a state actor.’’ For em-
phasis, the report does not accuse any-
one of conducting the attacks.
On June 13, 2019, a Japanese tanker
and Norwegian tanker were attacked
with explosive devices that caused con-
siderable fire and hull damage to both
tankers.
Who is responsible for these two
tanker attacks? There is international
disagreement.
America and the United Kingdom
blame Iran. Iran denies responsibility.
Other nations offer no opinion and cau-
tion against a rush to judgment. Per-
haps more evidence will persuade the
international community that Iran or-
chestrated these tanker attacks, per-
haps not.
Regardless of blame, there are other
factors to consider. For example, what
is America’s national security interest
in these six tanker attacks? Not a sin-
gle attacked tanker is owned by Ameri-
cans. Rather, they are owned by Saudi
Arabia, Norway, the United Arab Emir-
ates, and Japan.
Not a single attacked tanker in-
volved oil produced in America. Rath-
er, all six tankers were shipping Saudi
Arabian or United Arab Emirates oil.
Neither of the two tankers loaded with
cargo was bound for the United States.
Hence, the United States has no na-
tional security interest in the six at-
tacked tankers sufficient to trigger an
American retaliatory military action
against Iran.
There are, however, other nations
that do have a national security inter-
est in these tanker attacks. Japan and
South Korea import roughly 80 percent
of their oil from the Persian Gulf. India
imports roughly 60 percent of its oil
from the Persian Gulf. China imports
roughly 50 percent of its oil from the
Persian Gulf. Western Europe imports
almost 20 percent of its oil from the
Persian Gulf.
Hence, Japan, South Korea, China,
India, Western Europe, and many other

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4924 June 20, 2019
nations all have a national security in-
terest in keeping Persian Gulf oil ship-
ping lanes open and are justified in
using military force to defend those
shipping lanes at their own risk and at
their own cost.
Similarly, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Ku-
wait, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United
Arab Emirates all have a national se-
curity interest in keeping Persian Gulf
shipping lanes open to transport the oil
they produce and sell. Hence, each of
these countries is justified in using
military force to defend their shipping
lanes at their own risk and at their
own cost.
Clearly, then, other nations have a
far greater national security interest
in Persian Gulf oil and shipping lanes
than does the United States. As such,
these nations should be primarily re-
sponsible for using military force as is
necessary to protect their national se-
curity interests.
Madam Speaker, America must stop
being the world’s policeman on every
corner of the planet. America must
stop burning through our treasury and
risking our American lives when we
have no compelling security interest in
a dispute. This is particularly true
when those nations that do have a na-
tional security interest don’t care
enough about their own national secu-
rity interest to protect them.
While America can and should help
our allies, it is equally important that
America’s allies put up their own de-
fense capabilities, protect their own
national security interests, and shoul-
der their own share of military bur-
dens.
If countries with a national security
interest in Persian Gulf shipping lanes
act as a unified force to protect them,
and if they ask for America’s assist-
ance, America should then, and only
then, consider military assistance. Un-
less that happens, this is not America’s
fight.
Of course, should Iran attack Ameri-
cans or their property, or should Iran
attack and kill any of our allies’ citi-
zens, an entirely different set of consid-
erations come into play, and Iran will
not like America’s response to those
kinds of attacks.

COMMEMORATING OKLAHOMANS
IN SPACE
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. LEE
of California). The Chair recognizes the
gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Ms.
KENDRA S. HORN) for 5 minutes.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk
about Oklahomans in space.
Born in Oklahoma’s Fifth Congres-
sional District in Shawnee, retired Air
Force Colonel Gordon Cooper was one
of the first Mercury astronauts. In 1962,
he served as a backup for the Sigma 7
mission. A year later, he circled Earth
22 times in the space capsule Faith 7,
completing the sixth and last of the
Mercury manned spaceflights.
He also served as a command pilot of
Gemini 5 on an 8-day endurance mis-
sion. This not only made him the first
person to make two orbital flights, but
he also set an endurance record on this
mission of nearly 191 hours.
Before becoming an astronaut with
NASA, Colonel Cooper earned a com-
mission with the U.S. Army in the late
1940s and then transferred to the Air
Force where he received a bachelor of
science degree in aeronautics from the
Air Force Institute of Technology,
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in
Ohio.
If you visit the National Portrait
Gallery in D.C., you will see a picture
of Colonel Cooper as one of NASA’s
Mercury Seven astronauts. I am proud
to honor his memory, legacy, and his-
tory-making achievements in space.
Madam Speaker, women astronauts
from Oklahoma have also made critical
contributions to our Nation’s space
program. Jerrie Cobb and Shannon
Lucid are two of those pioneers who
paved the way in space and aero-
nautics.
Cobb is considered one of the most
gifted female pilots in history and a
fierce advocate for women astronauts.
Born in Norman, Oklahoma, and a
graduate from Oklahoma City’s
Classen High School, Cobb became the
first woman to fly in the Paris Air
Show and was among the first women
certified to be an astronaut as a mem-
ber of the little-known Mercury 13 in
the early 1960s. She testified before
Congress in 1962, urging lawmakers to
allow women to go into space.
b 0930
Though she never got to leave the
Earth’s atmosphere, Cobb helped pave
the way for future generations of
women astronauts like fellow Oklaho-
man and astronaut, Dr. Shannon Lucid.
I pause to honor the memory of Dr.
Cobb today, as she passed away 3
months ago at the age of 88.
Lady astronaut Dr. Shannon Lucid, a
Congressional District Five resident,
graduated from Bethany High School.
Among the first six women astronauts
selected by NASA, Dr. Lucid became an
astronaut in 1979. Not only did she fly
on five spaceflights, she is also the
only American woman to serve aboard
the Mir Space Station.
Before Peggy Whitson broke the
record of the number of hours in space,
Dr. Lucid set the record with 5,354
hours in space. In December of 1996, she
became the first woman to receive the
Congressional Medal of Honor for her
record-breaking service aboard the
Mir, and she retired from NASA in 2012.
Because of the glass ceiling shattered
by Jerrie Cobb and Dr. Shannon Lucid,
generations of women can and do now
follow in their footsteps.

HONORING FRANK LAMERE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Nebraska (Mr. SMITH) for 5 minutes.
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor Frank
LaMere, who died last Sunday night.
A member of the Winnebago Tribe,
Frank was proud of his heritage and
worked tirelessly for the Native Amer-
ican community. Frank spent the ma-
jority of his life fighting for Native
American causes and, as a result, was
known across Nebraska and other
States for his determined efforts.
I had the opportunity of interacting
with Frank for several years and was
always impressed by the civility he
showed, his respect for others, and,
most of all, how considerate and
thoughtful he was.
Frank had an interest in politics and
policy and sought to build relation-
ships with folks on both sides of the
aisle. He was devoted to making life
better for others and was a role model
in his civic engagement.
Frank will be dearly missed, but the
people of South Sioux City, Nebraska,
and the entire State will remember
him for his loyalty, his passion, and his
ability to build friendships along the
way.
Madam Speaker, I offer my condo-
lences to his family and community.

WAR POWERS RESIDE IN THE U.S.
CONGRESS
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma). The

Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. And still I rise,
Madam Speaker, because I love my
country and because I have reason to

American has reason to be concerned
about the issue that I shall address
today.
Those of us who are in the House of
Representatives should be especially
concerned because the issue involves
war and peace. It involves the sons and
daughters of Mr. and Mrs. America—
war and peace.
We have, by and through our Chief
Executive Officer, the President of the
United States of America, caused a
Nimitz-class battle group to go into the
Gulf region.
For those who do not know, this is
the ultimate expression of American
military prowess, a Nimitz-class battle
group. Above it, we have the genera-
tionally reliable B–52 bomber. They can
rain lethality on anything within their
range. Beneath the battle group, you
have, lurking, a submarine that can
launch without surfacing.
But the centerpiece of a Nimitz-class
battle group, especially this one, is the
USS Abraham Lincoln. The Abraham
Lincoln is an aircraft carrier that is
1,092 feet long. It can carry 90 fixed-
and rotary-winged aircraft. The Abra-
ham Lincoln has two A–4 Westinghouse
nuclear reactors. When it is fueled and
it is sent out on a mission, it does not
have to come back for 25 years. It is
the centerpiece of American military
prowess.
To borrow a term from where I grew
up, you don’t send the Abraham Lincoln
if you are shucking. You send it when

you are not bluffing. You don’t send
the Abraham Lincoln, Madam Speaker,
unless you want to make a statement.
This is the ultimate in American
military prowess. It has the ability to
rain lethality unlike the human mind
can imagine. This is the Abraham Lin-
coln, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, a
part of a battle group. It is the equiva-
lent of sending a military base. You
don’t send it to bluff.
This is why we must be concerned.
We have to be concerned because, if
you send it because you are bluffing,
Madam Speaker, you are playing with
American military prowess; and if you
send it because you are going to use it,
you have to come to Congress. Con-
gress has to give the word.
We don’t play with this kind of
lethality. There is a reality associated
with this lethality that we cannot
imagine. We have no way of predicting
what can happen if we use this ulti-
mate form of military force.
We obviously have it to defend our-
selves and defend our allies. I don’t ob-
ject to the defensive nature of military
action, but I am concerned if you send
in this level of lethality because you
are bluffing.
So I am calling on all Americans to
please pay attention to what is hap-
pening in the Gulf region, and I am
saying to my brethren and my sisters
here in Congress: We are going to re-
gret it if this level of lethality is being
used and we did not exercise our duty,
our obligation, and our responsibility
to review impeachment of this Presi-
dent. We are going to regret it if it
happens.
This is the ultimate in lethality. You
don’t send it because you are bluffing.
It is time for us to do what we should
do here in this Congress: require an Au-
thorization for Use of Military Force;
make sure that we play our role in this
process. This is the Congress. We de-
clare war. Don’t let all of our authority
be usurped by the executive branch.
We ought to have some sense of duty
to what the Constitution requires of
us. We see what is coming, and we are
going to regret it if this ultimate in
lethality is utilized in this Gulf region
for a bluff that, unfortunately, was
called.

HONORING THE LIFE OF FRANK
LAMERE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Iowa (Mr. KING) for 5 minutes.
Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I
appreciate the opportunity to address
you here on the floor of the House of
Representatives.
I rise today to honor the life of
Frank LaMere. Frank LaMere was a
leader for the Winnebagos, who had
land on both sides of the Missouri
River in the Sioux City area, and also
for Native Americans, especially in the
upper Midwest.
Over the years, our lives interacted
multiple times. I had the opportunity
to work with him and see the
gentleness of his nature.
I will say that he mellowed out in his
later years, but he never let up. He
never took his foot off the throttle. He
just found a smoother way to get to the
goals, which were to help out his Na-
tive American people.
He was a model of dedication to self-
lessness, and he also had more than his
fair share of tragedy, loss, and demons
to fight.
Over the course of his life, he dem-
onstrated that no matter the obstacles,
he could rise above them, as we could
rise above those and do the most good
we can with the tools we have to work
with.
He overcame addiction himself. He
had dedicated his life to being a voice
for the voiceless, including securing
housing, food, and other necessities for
the people whom he did such a good job
representing in the area.
Yet, tragedy still exists in our com-
munities, and Frank LaMere saw the
need to address those situations. We
collaborated on a couple of important
things together. They were the pas-
sions of Frank LaMere who passed
away on Sunday evening.
The imagination and the dream that
he had was to build Hope Street, which
would be a treatment center and hous-
ing center primarily for Native Ameri-
cans who are drug addicted or alcohol
addicted.
That project, by the way, has the lan-
guage that allows it to qualify in this
appropriations bill that we have before
us this week.
Also, the second project that was a
very, very important project was when
Frank and I had a chance meeting in
the airport in Omaha, and we began to
discuss these things, too, that were on
his mind, that brought about the bill
that is now H.R. 184. That is the Winne-
bago Land Transfer Act.
In 1865, the United States Govern-
ment and the Winnebago Tribe signed a
treaty that granted that land on both
sides of the Missouri River to the Win-
nebago Tribe. As the river changed and
situations changed—actually, I
shouldn’t say both sides of the river. It
was the Nebraska side of the river.
When the river changed, that meant
that a lot of that land actually ended
up in Iowa.
The Corps of Engineers came in 105
years later and condemned that prop-
erty for their own project. It was a
takings, and I believe it was an uncon-
stitutional takings. In doing so, they
never compensated them for that land,
and they didn’t use that land for the
project for which they had intended.
So, over time, the Winnebagos were
able to put the money together to go to
court. The statute of limitations had
expired. The court ruled that, if they
were going to rule on the issue, they
would grant the land back to the Win-
nebagos, but it was beyond their juris-
diction because of the statute of limi-
tations.
The only thing that puts that land
back is an act of Congress, and that is
the Winnebago Land Transfer Act, H.R.
184. If we can conclude that this week
or next week, it will be the time that
we have finished the biggest part of the
work of Frank LaMere. We should do
so to honor his life.
One of the things that he was quoted
as saying, and this was at the services
for him: ‘‘If you haven’t been
marginalized at least once a week, then
you probably haven’t done very much.’’
I can identify with that, Madam
Speaker, and I can identify with the
life of selfless work of Frank LaMere.
We honor his life. Let’s honor his life
in this Congress this week or next.

STOPPING GUN VIOLENCE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Illinois (Ms. KELLY) for 5 minutes.
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, I rise today for Hadiya Pen-
dleton, taken by gun violence on Janu-
ary 23, 2013. She was 15.
I rise for Terrell Bosley, taken by
gun violence on April 4, 2006. He was 18
and unloading musical instruments
from a car.
I rise for Blair Holt, taken by gun vi-
olence on May 7, 2007. He was 16 and
died shielding others from bullets.
Today I rise for Gregory Shondale,
killed yesterday. He was 41.
Madam Speaker, I rise for them and
for all those taken from us by senseless
gun violence that continues unchecked
in our Nation because of inaction on
the part of the Senate Majority Leader
and the President.
I rise today more than 100 days after
this House, the people’s House, sent bi-
partisan universal background check
legislation, H.R. 8, to the Senate,
which has failed to consider any legis-
lation for more than 8 weeks.
I rise today for the 100 Americans
who will lose their lives to gun vio-
lence today and Americans who will be
shot, survive, and face a lifetime of re-
covery. That will be 210 Americans.
I rise because someone must—some-
one must—stand up to speak for those
who have had their voices silenced by
gun violence. Someone must speak for
the mom of five who suffered domestic
violence, found the courage to leave
her abusive relationship, and ended up
dead because her abuser had easy ac-
cess to a gun.
Someone must speak up for the little
girl playing in the park who was
gunned down because guns are more
common than schools in her neighbor-
hood.
Someone must speak for the veteran
and the farmer who face what seem
like insurmountable odds with no way
out, who tragically end their own life.
Someone must speak for those killed
at Pulse and at supermarkets because
of who they are and whom they love.
Someone must speak for the person,
often a young Black man, who will be
gunned down by a cop who shot first
and asked questions later.
Someone must speak for the first re-
sponders who are taking their own

lives at alarming rates. Someone must
speak for them.
Someone must tell the story of ev-
eryday gun violence that plagues our
communities from Chicago to Key
West.
Too often, this House focuses on the
mass shooting tragedies in this Nation
that have become more and more com-
mon since our Republican colleagues
allowed the assault weapons ban to ex-
pire in 2004. We hold moments of si-
lence. My colleagues run to their
tweets with their thoughts and prayers
to justify their continued and neg-
ligent inaction. But we forget gun vio-
lence happens every day in every com-
munity.
We cannot forget about those who
died alone from gun violence in city
parks, in road rage incidents, and in
their own homes, entrapped by depres-
sion and despair. They, too, deserve to
be remembered. Their lives and stories
should also challenge us to actions so
we can say ‘‘not one more’’ and then
actually do something to prevent an-
other death, another funeral, and an-
other life forever altered.
Madam Speaker, I am proud that this
House finally acted. After the Amer-
ican people sent a historic wave of new
Members to Congress, Members who
understand that commonsense gun
safety reform saves lives, we voted to
enact bipartisan universal background
check legislation that is supported by
more than 90 percent of Americans and
70 percent of NRA members.
We also voted to close the Charleston
loophole, a clear gap in our laws that
allowed a known white supremacist to
legally purchase a weapon and use it to
steal the lives of nine people seeking to
better know their God.
We know this is a problem. We passed
legislation to close this loophole, and
yet the Senate, controlled by Repub-
licans, have still done nothing. My
good colleagues in the Senate continue
to do nothing while people die every
day in every State and in every com-
munity. Still they do nothing. They
refuse to act. Still they offer hollow
thoughts and prayers while rushing to
the bank with pockets full of NRA do-
nations.
b 0945
Perhaps that is the problem, Madam
Speaker. Perhaps it is the money.
The American people should know
that the President got $30 million from
the NRA in his 2016 campaign. What
are they buying?
The American people deserve to
know that the Senate majority leader
has taken more than $1 million from
the NRA over his career. What were
they investing in?
The American people deserve to
know that too many in the GOP are
bought and sold by the NRA or too
often afraid of them to grow a spine
and stand up for their constituents.
It is a sad fact that just 8—that is
right, just 8—of 198 Members, or a mere
4 percent of the House Republican Con-
ference, had the courage to stand with
gun violence victims and 90 percent of
Americans. I thank those courageous
eight Republicans for voting to save
lives.
Madam Speaker, to my colleagues
still too afraid or too owned by the
NRA to act, I say good luck next year.
They had their chance, and they failed
miserably. They are on the wrong side
of history.
Next year, the American people will
not forget.

RECOGNIZING THOMAS J. HAAS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA) for 5 minutes.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the career of a
friend, public servant, and caring edu-
cator: Grand Valley State University
President Thomas J. Haas.
As a retired U.S. Coast Guard captain
who also holds a Ph.D., President Haas
has devoted his life of service to our
country and, most recently, to west
Michigan and the students of Grand
Valley State University.
Having been appointed the univer-
sity’s fourth president in 2006, he suc-
cessfully laid a foundation for a culture
that nurtures innovation and excel-
lence. Under his leadership, enrollment
has soared to over 25,000 students,
while 46 undergraduate and graduate
programs have also been added and the
university expanded with 2.5 million
square feet of new buildings.
‘‘T. Haas,’’ as he is affectionately
called by students, and his wife,
Marcia, will forever be cherished and
adored by the Grand Valley commu-
nity. Together, they have passionately
dedicated themselves to putting stu-
dents first.
The now-famous selfie with T. Haas,
as it is known, it is a clear example of
the way they treated every student
like their own.
President Haas is the epitome of the
phrase ‘‘Laker for a Lifetime.’’ It has
been an honor to work with him in sup-
port of Grand Valley, its students, and
all of west Michigan.
While his time as president may be
coming to an end, his legacy and im-
pact will forever live on.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. ZELDIN).
RECOGNIZING LUIS ALVAREZ
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Lou Alvarez, an in-
credible patriot, Long Islander, and 9/11
first responder who inspired so many
just last week in front of the House Ju-
diciary Committee in support of the
Never Forget the Heroes Act, which
will reauthorize and fully fund the 9/11
Victim Compensation Fund.
After his appearance in D.C., Lou
rushed home for his 69th round of
chemo. Let me repeat that: After com-
ing all the way down to Washington to
beg for the benefits that he and so
many others were promised, Lou Alva-
rez had to rush home for his 69th round
of chemo.
Unfortunately, when he got home,
things did not go as expected. This
morning, I am sad to report, Lou is in
hospice, watching us here on the House
floor.
Lou is one of the many first respond-
ers who raced to Ground Zero on Sep-
tember 11 without a second thought,
who, in the weeks following, worked 12-
hour shifts on the pile, aiding in the
rescue and cleanup efforts.
Lou, like so many of his fellow first
responders, was diagnosed with one of
the thousands of cancers attributed to
the inhalation of toxic air and debris at
Ground Zero.
We have lost more 9/11 first respond-
ers since 9/11 than we lost people on 9/
11 itself. We must fully fund and reau-
thorize the 9/11 Victim Compensation
Fund.
Last Tuesday, like so many times be-
fore, Lou once again made the trip to
Washington to testify in front of the
committee, begging Congress to fully
fund the compensation fund.
It wasn’t his first time to D.C., not
by a long shot. It wasn’t his second or
third time. Unfortunately, it may have
been his last.
The wait has been a disgrace to these
first responders, to their families, and
to our Nation.
This isn’t just a New York issue, and
I thank BILL HUIZENGA for staying
around for Lou. This isn’t a Demo-
cratic or Republican Party platform or
a political football.
This is a responsibility that we all
shoulder as Americans, first and fore-
most. This is the spirit of our country.
It is who we are as a people.
Last Wednesday, following Lou’s tes-
timony, the Never Forget the Heroes
Act passed committee unanimously.
This floor and the Senate need to pass
it to make this bill law right away.
I would like to sign off today the way
Lou signs off nearly everything he
writes, the way he lives his life each
and every day, until his very last. Lou
Alvarez says, ‘‘Still here, still breath-
ing, still fighting.’’

WELCOMING VERY REVEREND
CANON MARTINI SHAW
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the gentleman from Penn-

minute.
There was no objection.
Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, it is my
great honor to welcome today’s guest
chaplain, who is from my district. Fa-
ther Shaw is the rector of the historic
African Episcopal Church of St. Thom-
as in Philadelphia. The church was
founded in 1729 as the first black
church in the Episcopal Church in the
United States. It is also the oldest Af-
rican American church in Philadelphia.
I have known Father Shaw for many,
many years. More recently, I had the
pleasure of working closely with him in
the Together for West Philadelphia ini-
tiative, which recently celebrated its
first year of working to improve health
and reduce poverty for the residents of
West Philadelphia. That is just one ex-
ample from his long record of working
for social justice.
I know Father Shaw has previously
lived in Detroit and Chicago, but I am
glad that he has chosen to live where
America began, in the City of Broth-
erly Love and Sisterly Affection.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

WORLD REFUGEE DAY
(Ms. PINGREE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
recognition of World Refugee Day and
in support of the community of refu-
gees who have resettled in my district.
One of these refugees is Kifah
Abdulla, who lived in Baghdad until
war broke out at home. He spent over
8 years as a prisoner of war. He was iso-
lated because of his activism against
the dictatorship.
He was a refugee for 11 years in
Amman, Jordan, and 5 years in the
Netherlands, before coming to Port-
land, Maine in 2011. He is now an Ara-
bic teacher, a published poet, a per-
former, and an activist.
There is a reason America has signed
international treaties and passed laws
giving shelter to those fleeing persecu-
tion. Many refugees, like Mr. Abdulla,
were jailed or tortured because they
protested, organized, or challenged
their government. These values are at
the core of our Nation.
Every year, refugees travel 1.2 billion
miles in search of safety. And right
now, we are in the midst of the great-
est refugee crisis since World War II.
Sadly, when people fleeing the violence
need us most, the administration has
dramatically reduced refugee admis-
sions.
In a Nation where nearly all of us
have come ‘‘from away,’’ as we say in
Maine, I urge us all to make our com-
munities warm, safe, and welcoming to
refugees across the globe.

HONORING STAFF SERGEANT
CLIFFORD CHESTER SIMS
(Mr. DUNN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to honor the life of Staff Sergeant
Clifford Chester Sims. Sergeant Sims
made the ultimate sacrifice for our
country during the Vietnam war.
Sergeant Sims was born in Port St.
Joe, Florida, and orphaned at a young
age. He was adopted at age 13 by James
and Irene Sims. He met his wife, Mary,
and joined the Army after high school.
On February 21, 1968, while behind
enemy lines during the Battle of Hue in
the Republic of Vietnam, Sims threw
himself on a grenade in defense of his
squad. Sergeant Sims made the ulti-
mate sacrifice to protect his comrades
in arms, all while fighting in the name
of liberty.
Sergeant Sims was posthumously
awarded the Medal of Honor for his he-
roic actions. This week, Bay County of-
ficially named June 18 Staff Sergeant
Clifford Chester Sims Day.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in hon-
oring Sergeant Clifford Sims and all
our fallen heroes who gave that last
full measure of devotion to our Nation.

According to the Military Health

physical and mental health problems.

NORTHERN BORDER REGIONAL
COMMISSION AMENDMENT
(Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire

Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to thank my col-
leagues for unanimously passing my bi-
partisan amendment yesterday to in-
crease funding by $3 million to the
Northern Border Regional Commission.
The NBRC is a critical, rural eco-
nomic development agency that has
created jobs in my district and sup-
ported so many meaningful projects
around New Hampshire.
From 2010–2017, the NBRC invested
over $7 million into the Granite State
communities and, more importantly,
leveraged nearly $31 million in match-
ing funds.
This is a smart and strategic use of
tax dollars, and I am so pleased that
the House passed my bipartisan amend-
ment with Congressman CHRIS PAPPAS,
Congresswoman ELISE STEFANIK, and
Congressman PETER WELCH, to increase
funding to the historic level of $25 mil-
lion in the next fiscal year.
As a conferee on the 2018 farm bill

ALZHEIMER’S AND BRAIN
AWARENESS MONTH
(Mr. KATKO asked and was given

Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, June is
Alzheimer’s and Brain Awareness
Month, and I rise today to share with
this Chamber the impact that Alz-
heimer’s disease has had on this coun-
try and my family.
Today, 5.8 million Americans live
with brain disease. I have witnessed
firsthand the burdens of these illnesses
because my father, Andrew Katko,
lived with Alzheimer’s for nearly a dec-
ade before succumbing to the disease a
few months ago.
My family was faced with the dif-
ficult decision on how to care for our
father during this time in his life. This
is not uncommon among families
across our great Nation.
Often, family and friends are primary
caretakers for those suffering with Alz-
heimer’s and dementia. My mother,
Mary Lou, served as my father’s pri-
mary caregiver, joining 16 million
Americans who provide unpaid care.
This year, unpaid caregivers will pro-
vide 18.5 billion hours of care valued at
$234 billion.
The BOLD Infrastructure for Alz-
heimer’s Act was signed into law last
Congress proudly and is now being im-
plemented. This legislation authorizes
the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention to research prevention
methods for dementias and establish
local treatment facilities.
I am committed to passing additional
policies that improve the lives of those
living with dementias.
f
ACCESS TO BROADBAND
(Mr. DELGADO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. DELGADO. Mr. Speaker, as we
work through this year’s appropria-
tions package, I want to thank my col-
leagues for passing my amendment to
fix our broken broadband mapping sys-
tem.
Access to broadband is a timely and
urgent need in my district, and if we
don’t address how we map and evaluate
who has high-speed Internet, small
business owners, students, and farmers
will be left behind.
The FCC’s recent Broadband Deploy-
ment Report states that more than 21
million Americans lack access to high-
speed internet, but everyone in this
body and back home knows there are
many more out there.
The issue is that we evaluate
broadband coverage based on census-
block mapping. In other words, if one
house on one block can purchase cov-
erage, the whole block is deemed
‘‘served.’’
We will never close the digital divide
relying on bad data. My amendment
prevents the National Telecommuni-
cations and Information Administra-
tion from relying solely on census-
block data for broadband availability
maps.
Bad data yields bad maps, and this
critical amendment will put an end to
it. I thank my colleagues for joining
me in support of this crucial amend-
ment.

HONORING DAVIE COUNTY
FIREFIGHTERS
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I proudly
rise today to recognize and honor fire-
fighters from my district in Davie
County, North Carolina, who battled
an early morning fire caused by a
lightning strike earlier this week.
Thanks to their efforts and heroism,
Mr. Speaker, a church building was
spared.
Around 3:30 a.m. this Tuesday, Davie
County firefighters responded to a fire
at Smith Grove United Methodist
Church along U.S. Highway 158 in
Mocksville. When the firefighters ar-
rived on the scene, flames were burst-
ing out of the roof and immediate ac-
tion was needed to stop the flames, ac-
cording to Smith Grove Fire Chief Don
Howard.
Even though the lightning strike
caused the steeple to fall off the roof of
the church, the firefighters pressed on
to fight the flames and save the major-
ity of the building.
I am grateful for the service of these
men and women, many of whom are
volunteers, who every day put them-
selves in danger to keep our families
and our communities safe.
Mr. Speaker, I would also like to rec-
ognize the departments that responded,
which included Smith Grove, Farm-
ington, Cornatzer-Dulin, Mocksville,
the Cooleemee Fire Departments;
Davie EMS; Davie County Fire Mar-
shal’s Office; and the Davie County
Sheriff’s Office.
I thank these heroes and others like
them in our country.
f
NATIONAL GUARD AMENDMENT
WILL IMPROVE READINESS
(Mr. BARR asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to discuss my amendment to H.R. 2740,
the Defense appropriations bill.
With the cosponsorship of my fellow
Kentuckian, Congressman GUTHRIE, my
amendment increases Army, Army Re-
serve, and Army National Guard oper-
ations and maintenance by $2 million
each for training support. This funding
will support the training of National
Guard and Reserve components by the
Army in order to improve readiness.
General Lengyel of the National
Guard Bureau, earlier this year before
the Appropriations Committee, said:
‘‘There is only one standard of readi-
ness in fighting America’s wars. This
readiness requires the National Guard
to be deployable, sustainable, and
interoperable with our Active compo-
nents.’’
As the representative for Kentucky’s
National Guard headquarters, it is es-
sential we support training and coordi-
nation between the components of our
Armed Forces.
I was proud to advocate for this im-
portant increased funding, which will
allow Active-Duty Army personnel to
more frequently advise, assist, and
train with Guard and Reserve units on
drill weekends to ensure both are meet-
ing the same level of readiness.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues
for adopting this amendment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4929
June 20, 2019
to join in commemorating June 20,
2019, as American Eagle Day and to cel-
ebrate the recovery and restoration of
the bald eagle, the national symbol of
the United States.
On June 20, 1782, the eagle was des-
ignated as the national emblem of the
United States by the Founding Fathers
at the Second Continental Congress.
The bald eagle is the central image of
the Great Seal of the United States and
is displayed in the official seal of many
branches and departments of the Fed-
eral Government.
The bald eagle is an inspiring symbol
of the spirit of freedom and democracy
of the United States. Since the found-
ing of the Nation, the image, meaning,
and symbolism of the eagle has played
a significant role in art, music, his-
tory, commerce, literature, architec-
ture, and culture of the United States.
The bald eagle’s habitat only exists in
North America.
Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues
will join me in celebrating June 20,
2019, as American Eagle Day, which
marks the recovery and restoration of
the bald eagle.

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
further consideration of the bill (H.R.
3055) making appropriations for the De-
partments of Commerce and Justice,
Science, and Related Agencies for the
fiscal year ending September 30, 2020,
and for other purposes, with Mr. HECK
(Acting Chair) in the chair.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The Acting CHAIR. When the Com-
mittee of the Whole rose on Wednes-
day, June 19, 2019, amendment No. 58
printed in part B of House Report 116–
119 offered by the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. CUNNINGHAM) had
been disposed of.
Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chair, I rise as
the designee of Chairwoman LOWEY,
and I move to strike the last word.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from New York is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chair, I yield to
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.
JACKSON LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I
thank the gentleman from New York
for yielding.
Mr. Chair, this is Maleah Davis. We
mourn her loss in Houston, Texas. She
was 4 years old.
My amendment provides funding to
support and engage adult men and
young persons to reduce and prevent
domestic violence against children. In
recent reports, 1,600 children died be-
cause of abuse or neglect.
This amendment will help ensure the
safety of vulnerable children in at-risk
households who are powerless to get
the help and attention they need from
our government.
To illustrate this, this is the case of
Maleah Davis, a 4-year-old girl who
lived in Houston. In the past, Texas
Child Protective Services removed
Maleah and her two brothers from
their home over reports of abuse but
returned them again in February. They
took them away from their relatives
and, along with a court judge, returned
them to this family.
Maleah’s mother dated her boyfriend
for years, and they had a son. Maleah’s
mother had gone to a funeral out of
town.
When the boyfriend initially reported
that his girlfriend’s daughter was miss-
ing, he told detectives that he had been
attacked, but surveillance video shows
him carrying a black bag out of the
home.
The last time that Maleah was seen
was going into that home.
The real question is whether or not
the Child Protective Services is really
doing its job, whether or not it is deal-
ing with educating these families or in-
tervening in these families to make
sure a loving little girl like Maleah
Davis does not lose her life.
In addition to this funding to inter-
vene in men and boys’ lives to prevent
this kind of abuse and loss of life, and
the tragedy of finding the remains of
little Maleah in a plastic bag along the
highway in Arkansas, I look forward to
working with my colleagues on an
overhaul of children’s protective serv-
ices throughout the Nation, because, in
particular in Texas, 1,600 children die
of abuse and neglect, many of them in
children’s protective services.
I am delighted that my amendment
passed.
Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Chairwoman
LOWEY’s En Bloc Amendment No. 2, which in-
cludes Jackson Lee Amendment No. 19.
I wish to thank Chairman MCGOVERN and
Ranking Member COLE of the Rules Com-
mittee for making this Jackson Lee Amend-
ment in order.
I thank Chairman SERRANO and Ranking
Member ADERHOLD for their hard work in
bringing Division A, the Commerce-Justice-
Science portion of this omnibus appropriations
legislative package, to the floor.
Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to
explain my amendment, which is simple and
straightforward and ensures that our govern-
ment works to protect our children.
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 19, repro-
grams $2 million in the Office of Justice Pro-
grams grant funding to support programs to
engage adult men and young persons to re-
duce and prevent domestic violence against
children.
This amendment will help ensure the safety
of vulnerable children in at-risk households,
who are powerless to getting the help and at-
tention they need from our government.
To illustrate the need for this amendment,
let me share with you the tragic case of
Maleah Davis, a 4–year old little girl who lived
in Houston.
In the past, Texas Child Protective Services
removed Maleah and her two brothers from
their home over reports of abuse, but returned
them to the home in February.
Maleah’s mother dated her boyfriend for
years and they shared a toddler son together.
Maleah’s mother had gone out of town
when she left her daughter under her boy-
friend’s care.
When the boyfriend initially reported that his
girlfriend’s daughter was missing, he told de-
tectives he had been attacked by unknown
men a day earlier and that they kidnapped
Maleah.
However, surveillance video outside of the
home shows Maleah never left their apartment
after she followed him in, and shows him car-
rying a laundry basket with a trash bag out of
the building a day before he reported her
missing.
Maleah’s remains were later discovered in a
bag along Interstate 30 in Arkansas.
Although the case has not been completed
yet, there are valuable lessons that we can
learn from Maleah’s and similar cases.
There have been similar cases to Maleah
where the caretaker initially reports a missing
child but we later learn that the caretaker is
actually the suspect and perpetrator of the
crime.
Similar cases include 5–year old AJ Freund
from Illinois, whose father confessed to hiding
his body in the basement, and 7-week old
Shaylie Madden from North Carolina, whose
mother has been charged with first-degree at-
tempted murder.
The nation has learned from Maleah and
other similar stories that we must do every-
thing in our power to protect at risk children.
Maleah Davis should be alive today.
Horrible cases such as this should not be
happening in America; we need to make sure
our checks and balances are keeping our chil-
dren safe.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4930 June 20, 2019
Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for
yielding.
Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chair, I yield to
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. FOS-
TER).
Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chair, I thank my
colleagues for supporting en bloc No. 2,
which included two of my amendments.
The first amendment directs NASA
to work toward the development of a
low-enriched uranium space power re-
actor. NASA has been developing a
low-enriched uranium propulsion sys-
tem, but some of the funding for this
has been used on other projects, includ-
ing a power reactor using weapons-
grade uranium.
The problem is that if all the
spacefaring nations of the world start
using large amounts of weapons-grade
material in their space reactors, then
it will be difficult to ensure that this
material would not be diverted to
weapons programs in space and on
Earth.
If the U.S. develops a low-enriched
uranium space power reactor design, it
is likely that this type of reactor de-
sign will be adopted as a de facto
standard by other spacefaring nations,
making Earth and space a safer place.
The second amendment directs $6.5
million of the space technology ac-
count, which is currently funded at
$1.29 billion, to be used by the NASA
Innovative Advanced Concepts, or
NIAC, program. That will put the total
budget for NIAC at $15.2 million.
The NIAC program nurtures vision-
ary ideas that could transform future
NASA missions with the creation of
breakthroughs that could dramatically
lower the cost of space travel while si-
multaneously engaging America’s
innovators and entrepreneurs as part-
ners in the journey.
The nation that first demonstrates
such technologies will own the future
of space travel.
At $15.2 million, NIAC is still less
than a tenth of a percent of NASA’s
overall $22 billion budget, but this is a
small step in the right direction.
Mr. Chair, I thank my colleagues for
their support of these amendments.
Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
AMENDMENT NO. 65 OFFERED BY MR. CROW
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 65 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. CROW. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division A (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll. None of the funds made available
by this Act may be used by the Bureau of the
Census to use information or records re-
ceived through data sharing agreements in
contravention of existing law, including sec-
tions 9 and 214 of title 13, United States
Code.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Colorado (Mr. CROW) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Colorado.
Mr. CROW. Mr. Chair, I rise today to
offer an amendment that would defend
the integrity of the U.S. Census.
The U.S. Census is crucial to every
community, and it is our duty as Mem-
bers of Congress to ensure that every
person is counted. Not only does the
Census send a message that every per-
son should be counted, but it deter-
mines how and where Federal dollars
are spent.
Simply put, it is crucial for our local
cities and counties.
The Census count helps us under-
stand how to best provide healthcare,
education, housing, and numerous
other public services.
As the chairman of the Small Busi-
ness Subcommittee on Innovation and
Workforce Development, I have seen
how the Census determines how we
spend Federal dollars for programs like
the Small Business Development Cen-
ter Program and Community Develop-
ment Block Grants.
It is clear that the purpose of the
citizenship question, which we have al-
ready debated and will continue to de-
bate, is not to ensure that resources go
to the communities that need it most
but rather to stoke fear and suppress
the Census count.
In communities like mine, this would
have a huge impact. It would under-
mine our ability to gather an accurate
count. That doesn’t just hurt people in
our community. It strains public re-
sources and poses risks to our commu-
nity’s public health and safety.
I am here to lift up the voices in my
community and assure them that Con-
gress will not replace good governance
with fear.
While the administration announced
that it would continue the data-shar-
ing agreement with the Department of
Homeland Security to provide quality
statistics, my amendment reasserts
that existing law prohibits the Census
Bureau from sharing individualized
Census data across agencies. Congress
must stand firm in assuring the public
that no disaggregated data may leave
the Census.
Furthermore, this amendment raises
awareness of the law that penalizes any
disclosure of information by Census
employees who share personally identi-
fiable information with agencies like
Immigration and Customs Enforcement
and Customs and Border Protection.
Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.
ESCOBAR).
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Chair, I thank
Congressman CROW for yielding and for
his great work on this amendment.
Mr. Chair, the Census aims to count
each person living in the United States
every 10 years. It is important that we
get this count right because the infor-
mation helps determine a vast array of
decisions, from the number of congres-
sional seats to the allocation of Fed-
eral dollars.
For example, according to the Bren-
nan Center for Justice, my home State
of Texas stands to gain three congres-
sional seats. These gains will go a long
way for Texans and help bring much-
needed funds to every community in
the State, but we must ensure an accu-
rate count.
With the administration’s push to in-
clude a citizenship question on the up-
coming Census and scare Latino com-
munities like mine into not partici-
pating, this amendment underscores
the fact that no personally identifiable
information can be shared.
This amendment will give all resi-
dents, regardless of their immigration
status, the confidence they need to an-
swer the survey questions freely and to
know that their data will be kept safe
and secure.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment.
b 1030
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chair, I rise in
opposition, although I am not opposed
to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Alabama is
recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chair, I rise in
strong support of this amendment and
actually thank the gentleman for
bringing this amendment to the floor.
As I had said yesterday, I certainly
understand the concerns and the poten-
tial misuse of Census data, but by law
the Census Bureau cannot and it will
not disclose anyone’s response or share
data from which an individual can be
identified with ICE or any other agen-
cy.
Thankfully the law is already on the
books. Census data sharing is a felony
punishable by up to 5 years in prison
and a $250,000 fine. Census data is im-
portant, and it is confidential.
Fortunately, the Census Bureau is
deploying expert communicators and
trusted messengers all across the
United States to work in each commu-
nity to motivate each and every person
to respond to the Census, and it would
also help to spread the word that a per-
son’s response that they are not a cit-
izen of the United States does not pro-
vide the government with really any
reliable information about whether
they are lawfully present in the U.S.
So, even if this information was sent
to ICE, it would really have no use. It
would be of no use to them. A success-
ful 2020 Census will provide a full, accu-
rate, secure account of every person
living in the U.S. while gathering the
data vital to both understanding our
Nation’s changing demographics and
bolstering the enforcement of the Vot-
ing Rights Act.
Therefore, I join my colleagues in op-
posing any funds that would be made
available to violate the confidentiality
laws governing our Census, and I thank
the gentleman for raising this issue

and certainly support a ‘‘yes’’ vote on
this important amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. CROW. Mr. Chair, just to be
clear, we vehemently oppose the citi-
zenship question because as the evi-
dence has made it abundantly clear,
the purpose of that question is to sup-
press the count and to stoke fears
within our communities, which will
have a huge detrimental impact to our
ability to gain an accurate count and
provide resources in an effective way
and to govern throughout the country.
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from New York (Mr. SERRANO).
Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chair, I thank
the gentleman for yielding, and I rise
in strong support of this amendment.
The Commerce Department has not
answered basic questions related to the
purpose behind its sharing agreement
with the Department of Homeland Se-
curity.
Although I am not suggesting the
Census Bureau will use the information
for something other than statistical
purposes, I think it is important to re-
mind the Department we are mindful of
how individuals’ information will be
handled.
Ensuring the public trust in the Cen-
sus is vital to getting an accurate
count, and this amendment helps in
that goal.
Mr. CROW. Mr. Chair, in closing, I
just want to reiterate the need that we
send a very strong message as Members
of Congress that we have to enforce ex-
isting law.
We have to provide the confidence to
people throughout the country that the
Census will not be used to undermine
the integrity of the process, that the
citizenship question’s purpose is to
stoke fears and to suppress the count,
and that we will not allow those fears
to overcome the need for good govern-
ance to gain an accurate count and
make sure that the government is
working effectively and we are pro-
viding resources to people throughout
our communities.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. CROW).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 66 OFFERED BY MS. DEAN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 66 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 49, line 15, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(increased by $2,000,000)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentlewoman
from Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania.
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself
such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, public service is a high
calling, and we should do everything
we can to encourage our best and our
brightest, really all, to pursue it. For
me, the opportunity to serve in Con-
gress is a privilege and the honor of a
lifetime, and I know my fellow Mem-
bers feel the same.
Unfortunately, for too many young
people, public service isn’t always a re-
alistic option. Nowhere is that surer
than our broken criminal justice sys-
tem. There is no question that if we are
going to fix the problems that trouble
our criminal justice system, we need
prosecutors and public defenders of the
highest caliber.
Right now, students graduate law
school with between $84,000 and $122,000
in debt, while jobs in prosecutor’s or
defender’s offices pay just $56- to
$58,000 a year. As a result, students who
are eager to contribute their talents to
work for justice to defend the rights of
the vulnerable simply can’t afford to.
Well, we can’t afford to lose them.
The John R. Justice Act was designed
to fix this problem by providing stu-
dent loan repayment of $10,000 a year
for law students who make a minimum
3-year commitment to public service.
In theory, students can earn up to
$60,000 in total loan repayments, mak-
ing public service a far more realistic
option.
In reality, however, Congress has
failed to properly fund the program.
While the program is authorized up to
$25 million a year, actual appropria-
tions have fallen dramatically short
and now sit at just under $2 million.
Here are the consequences: In my
home State of Pennsylvania, the Com-
mission on Crime and Delinquency was
able to fund only 38 of the 167 appli-
cants received since 2015. That is less
than 25 percent. For those individuals
who were fortunate enough to receive
any funding at all, the grant amounts
totaled only $4,100.
That is better than nothing, but for
most students it is not enough to help
them pay down their debt and devote
themselves to public service.
It is time to act. This amendment
doubles the funds provided under the
John R. Justice Act, thereby delivering
an immediate, substantial impact. This
will mean concrete help for many more
students who are eager to work on be-
half of the public and build a better,
smarter, more compassionate criminal
justice system.
It also sends a signal that we in Con-
gress aren’t satisfied with mere rhet-
oric and that we will do what it takes
to give every student a chance to serve
their communities and their country.
Mr. Chair, in closing, I am very
pleased to put this forward in hopes
that we draw more talent not just in
my home State but across this country
to public service in prosecutor’s and
public defender’s offices around the Na-
tion.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.

the Attorney General on April 6, 2018.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas.
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
On April 6, 2018, then-Attorney Gen-
eral Jeff Sessions unveiled the zero-tol-
erance prosecution policy, a memo di-
recting U.S. Attorneys along the
southwest border to prosecute all im-
proper entry cases impacting thou-
sands of migrants since its implemen-
tation.
My amendment would end this policy
and restore prosecutorial discretion at
the Department of Justice. This
amendment is necessary because zero-
tolerance is the center of the adminis-
tration’s cruel family separation pol-
icy.
Under zero-tolerance, when an asy-
lum-seeking family crosses the border
between a port of entry, parents are
placed in DOJ custody while they
await their prosecution date. The child
is then deemed unaccompanied and
placed in the custody of the Office of
Refugee Resettlement. At least 3,000
families that we know of have been
separated. Some children were literally
ripped from their parents’ arms.
At the height of the family separa-
tion crisis last summer, the President
signed an executive order entitled: ‘‘Af-
fording Congress an Opportunity to Ad-
dress Family Separation.’’ That was on
June 20, 2018, exactly 1 year ago today.
However, this executive order does not
end zero-tolerance. Instead, the execu-
tive order favored family detention—
possibly indefinitely—over release.
I have seen the consequences of fam-
ily separation firsthand in my commu-
nity. Before zero-tolerance was imple-
mented, the administration used El
Paso as a testing ground for these hor-
rific family separations in the fall of
2017. During this pilot program, 281
families were separated. The American
Association of Pediatrics tells us that
separating children from their parents

is highly damaging and can cause long-
term health consequences from toxic
stress.
These children are suffering emotion-
ally and physically as a result of this
government. We must put an end to
this cruelty and work on reuniting all
of those who remain separated.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chair, I rise in
opposition to this amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Alabama (Mr. ADERHOLT) is recog-
nized for 5 minutes.
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chair, a vote
for this amendment is a vote to effec-
tively decriminalize the action of
crossing the border unlawfully.
The passage of this amendment
would directly undermine the sov-
ereignty of the United States, and fur-
thermore, if passed, the amendment
would immediately be seized upon by
every criminal human smuggling orga-
nization and used as a selling point to
convince migrants to come to the
United States in an unlawful manner.
It would trigger a flood of illegal im-
migration unlike anything we have
ever seen, which will cause most of the
most vulnerable individuals to attempt
to embark on a dangerous journey.
Cartels and human smuggling organi-
zations will profit. Our borders will be
less secure. And the American people
will pay the cost of open borders for
years to come.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. SERRANO).
Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chair, I rise in
very strong support of the gentle-
woman’s amendment.
The zero-tolerance experiment has
been a tragic mistake. It has swamped
U.S. Attorneys, U.S. Marshals, and dis-
trict courts with low level nonviolent
cases previously handled by DHS and,
if necessary, immigration courts. It
has also separated thousands of fami-
lies and traumatized children and par-
ents. Children may remain with par-
ents in DHS custody, but they cannot
follow them into jail, even for such
misdemeanor charges.
DOJ should focus on criminal gangs,
human trafficking, and smuggling,
most of which passes through, not be-
tween, the ports of entry.
The zero-tolerance policy restricts
seasoned prosecutors from pursuing se-
rious crime and distorts priorities by
requiring an unbalanced and inflexible
approach. It is clearly not improving
things at the border.
Mr. Chair, I urge the House to adopt
this very important amendment.
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Chair, I have no
further speakers. I would just urge all
of my colleagues to come to my com-
munity to see for themselves the im-
pact of this horrific policy.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time

AMENDMENT NO. 70 OFFERED BY MR. GOLDEN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 70 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. GOLDEN. Mr. Chairman, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division A (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll None of the funds made available
by this Act may be used to utilize a right
whale status and risk reduction decision sup-
port tool.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Maine (Mr. GOLDEN) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Maine.
Mr. GOLDEN. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume, and I
rise to offer my amendment to H.R.
3055.
Mr. Chair, it is frequently said that
working men and women feel left out
by their government’s decisionmaking
process. Too often in Washington,
those with the greatest financial
means can get the closest to the polit-
ical, governmental, and regulatory
process and, therefore, be better able to
influence it.
Just as bad is that, in this gridlock
political machine, what little action
that does take place often takes the
path of least resistance.
So when a species of whale is at risk
of extinction for a whole slew of com-
plex reasons—whether it be the over-
fishing that took place more than a
century ago, climate change and warm-
ing waters that wreak havoc upon a
whale’s habitat, seismic air gun testing
for oil and natural gas, deadly ship
strikes by a large shipping industry, or
the risk of entanglement in a
lobsterman’s fishing gear—who, and to
what degree, does Washington regulate
each? And who has a seat at the table
to ensure that the process behind such
decisions is fair and equitable?
Do we believe that a small group of
fishermen in Maine have as strong a
place at the table as does the fossil fuel
or shipping industry, or the govern-
mental affairs director with a K Street
office in Washington?
I don’t think so.
So NOAA, facing the threat of law-
suits, has rushed ahead using a deci-
sion support tool that was developed
for the purpose of reducing ship strikes
by the Navy and fed that tool with old
data and hasty assumptions and have
come forward to require Maine
lobstermen to achieve a 60 percent risk
reduction in their fishery.
What assumptions you might ask?
Maine’s own Department of Marine
Resources argues the tool is flawed be-
cause areas with a lot of fishing gear
but few whales are labeled ‘‘high risk,’’
and areas with a lot of whales and less
fishing gear are considered ‘‘low risk.’’
This scientific tool uses outdated
habitat data from the mid-Atlantic,
which is far away and different than
the gulf of Maine. When attributing re-
sponsibility for injury or death of
whale to fishing gear of an unknown
origin, NOAA assumes an equal dis-
tribution between U.S. and Canadian
gear, despite strong, recent scientific
and empirical evidence to the contrary.
And the data used do not accurately re-
flect the distribution shift of right
whales since the year 2010.
Recent studies have established firm
links between warming waters in the
gulf of Maine and a 90 percent reduc-
tion of the plankton that right whales
eat, calling into question whether the
whales have stopped visiting the warm-
ing, plankton-depleted waters of east-
ern Maine entirely, which would great-
ly reduce the likelihood that any whale
be entangled in Maine lobstermen’s
gear.
It is reasonable to ask NOAA to
allow its decision support tool to un-
dergo a peer-review process before en-
forcing punitive regulations upon
Maine fisherman. Maine’s Commis-
sioner of the Department of Marine Re-
sources has said that ‘‘peer-reviewed
science is the cornerstone of the deci-
sionmaking process.’’ Apparently, not
in this case.
This amendment would require
NOAA to use relevant data and an ef-
fective tool to ensure that its regula-
tions target areas of high risk and
yield the most effective conservation
benefits possible to protect the right
whale without unfairly burdening
Maine lobstermen.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise
in opposition to this amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from California is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, this
amendment would prohibit NOAA from
utilizing a science-based stakeholder
decision support tool to save the North
Atlantic right whale from imminent
extinction.
The decision support tool was devel-
oped based on the best-available sci-
entific information and models about
the population dynamics of the whales.
Defunding it undermines the con-
sensus-based conservation decision-
making process under the Marine
Mammal Protection Act and would set
a dangerous precedent for implementa-
tion of that law. It would also have
lasting impacts for other species, fish-
eries, and industries.
Again, this whale, the North Atlantic
right whale, is critically endangered.
There are less than 420 left. That is
fewer than we have Members of this
House of Representatives.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4933
June 20, 2019
With this amendment, while it may
be well-intended to protect Maine
lobstermen, it could have broadly un-
dermining effects on right whale con-
servation and on NOAA’s responsibil-
ities under the Marine Mammal Pro-
tection Act and the Endangered Spe-
cies Act.
I fully understand my colleague’s
concerns and efforts to support con-
stituencies. I, too, represent a coastal
district with commercial fishermen; so
does our colleague, SETH MOULTON in
Massachusetts. And we are committed
to working together to find a solution
to the crisis facing the North Atlantic
right whale, including holding a hear-
ing on Mr. MOULTON’s bill, the bipar-
tisan SAVE Right Whales Act, in the
Water, Oceans, and Wildlife Sub-
committee that I chair.
I am also fully supportive of his
amendment to increase funding for
right whale conservation. We should be
devoting more resources to develop in-
novative solutions for the recovery of
right whales to meet both fisheries and
conservation goals, not choosing one
goal over the other which, unfortu-
nately, this amendment does.
I would also point out that the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources worked
with Mr. GOLDEN on several other pos-
sible amendments. We continue to
stand ready to work on other ways and
other solutions, but unfortunately, this
amendment is not it.
Mr. Chair, I urge opposition, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. GOLDEN. Mr. Chair, I just want
to point out that the person who runs
this program for NOAA has actually re-
cently said that they intend to move
forward with regulations, then do a
peer review, and then, perhaps, come
back with a different conclusion.
I think that they have got this back-
wards. They should be doing it the
other way around, and that is what is
at the heart of this amendment. I
would urge support at this time for the
amendment, as well as for the Moulton
amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. PIN-
GREE), and I thank her for joining me
on this amendment and for her leader-
ship on behalf of Maine fisheries.
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I thank my
colleague for yielding me time, and I
thank the gentleman from California
(Mr. HUFFMAN) for raising concerns
that I think many of us have. But in
this case, I am supporting this amend-
ment.
Mr. Chair, I have long fought to pro-
tect the health of our oceans and the
sea life that inhabit them. That is why
I have opposed the Trump administra-
tion’s plan to drill in the gulf of Maine
since day one. And I am proud that this
Chamber recently passed our ocean
acidification bill.
Along with my colleague from
Maine’s Second District, we represent
90 percent of all the lobster landings in
the United States. Lobster is an iconic
symbol of our State, especially this
time of year when Mainers and visitors
from across the country enjoy our
coastline and our food.
I am proud of our very well-managed
and highly restrictive lobster fishery of
responsible operators. We need to work
together on a new peer-reviewed tool to
address this problem.
Our State also is the home of a vi-
brant conservation movement that
supports marine conservation and pro-
tecting the right whale. We have been
successful over the past several years
in creating tools with NOAA, our lob-
ster industry, and conservationists. In-
deed, the State of Maine has been ac-
tively involved in right whale con-
servation and worked with NOAA in
the past to ensure that our State is
doing all we can to keep whales safe in
our very active fisheries.
Unfortunately, in April, NOAA’s
Large Whale Take Reduction Team an-
nounced a plan to reduce right whale
deaths that forced lobstermen to re-
duce their vertical lines by 50 percent.
This risk-reduction tool, as my col-
league mentioned, has not gone
through a peer-review process despite
significant concerns from the stake-
holders that should be addressed. It
does not account for many of the issues
specific to the gulf of Maine.
Mr. Chair, for that reason, I urge my
colleagues to stand for a fair process,
and I support this amendment.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, may I
inquire as to how much time I have re-
maining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from California has 3 minutes remain-
ing.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. SERRANO).
Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chair, I thank
the gentleman from California for
yielding.
Mr. Chair, I recognize what my
friends from Maine are attempting to
do to help an important industry in
their State, but I must oppose them in
favor of supporting the critically en-
dangered Atlantic right whale.
The decision support tool that this
amendment would block is used by
States to determine how they can en-
sure they are taking steps to protect
these whales. Preventing its use would,
therefore, remove the ability of the
States to make their own determina-
tion.
Consequently, NOAA would be forced
to set a national standard. Addition-
ally, given the way it is drafted, this
amendment would block NOAA’s con-
servation work on right whales, not
just in the Atlantic, but also in the Pa-
cific.
Other agencies that rely on this tool
include the Coast Guard and Navy, who
rely on it to ensure that they are in
compliance with the Marine Mammal
Protection Act.
As I said earlier, I understand my
friend’s concern, and I would support
funding to help develop new and more
whale-friendly fishing gear and other
mitigation options. I cannot, however,
support an amendment that removes a
scientific tool to make informed nat-
ural resource management decisions. It
would only further endanger these ma-
jestic animals.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
oppose the amendment.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, the
tool that we are talking about was de-
veloped by a consensus-based take re-
duction team that included the con-
sensus support of all representatives of
the fishing industry who sat on that
team, the entire Maine delegation, that
the team unanimously supported the
decision.
Mr. Chair, an end-run around that
congressionally mandated process at
this critical moment, taking away the
lifeline that the North Atlantic right
whale needs as it teeters on the brink
of extinction, is the wrong way to pro-
tect Maine lobstermen. We can work
together on other threats, other ways
to help the lobstermen.
We need to start that conversation
with climate change. Certainly, the
trade impacts to the lobstermen and
other fishing communities should be
something we do to help them, the
threat of offshore drilling in the Atlan-
tic. And let’s get them some more fi-
nancial support if there is too much
burden to implement the technologies
and strategies that have been rep-
resented here.
But the North Atlantic right whale is
running out of time, and we should not
move the goalpost on these critically
endangered species in this way.
Mr. Chair, I request a ‘‘no’’ vote on
the amendment, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tleman from Maine (Mr. GOLDEN).
The question was taken; and the Act-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4934 June 20, 2019
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as
I may consume.
Mr. Chair, I rise today to address the
critical need to support both our law
enforcement and individuals in our
communities who are experiencing
mental health crisis.
Across this country, one in every ten
calls for police response involves a per-
son experiencing a mental health cri-
sis; one in four people killed by police
are suffering from a mental illness; one
in three people transported to hospital
emergency rooms for psychiatric rea-
sons are taken by the police.
Simply put, our police officers are on
the front lines in our Nation where far
too few people have access to the men-
tal healthcare they need and deserve.
But far too few have the training and
the skills they need to understand,
identify, and deescalate these situa-
tions.
We need to provide our officers with
the skills and understanding of mental
illness and how to appropriately re-
spond to both the safety of the officer
and the individual. The right training
makes everyone safer. We must equip
officers for encounters with people ex-
periencing mental health crises, and
my amendment helps to accomplish
this goal.
With this amendment, we can help
save lives and turn these encounters
into effective responses that help both
the individual and our communities.
My amendment funds grants for crisis
training for law enforcement through
the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice
Assistance Grant Program. This pro-
gram is giving State, local, and Tribal
governments the critical support they
need to provide individuals with impor-
tant training and education, and equip-
ment to operate at their best.
Byrne JAG is the leading source of
funding for local law enforcement to
help prevent and control crime, im-
prove the justice system, and funds ev-
erything from education and interven-
tion programs to reentry services to
target the roots of crime. Some of its
most well-known programs include the
bulletproof vests program, Smart Po-
licing Initiative, and the Juvenile Indi-
gent Defense, the National Missing Un-
identified Person System, and numer-
ous other programs.
Byrne JAG is a critical funding
source that makes our community
safer by attacking the problem of
crime from multiple angles, from com-
munity education to improving inter-
actions with police and the neighbor-
hoods they protect and, thus, is an ex-
cellent way to provide mental health
crisis response training for our police
officers.
Mr. Chair, in my State of Oklahoma,
officers in 2018 alone transferred 17,860
individuals experiencing a mental
health crisis to the emergency room.
Behavorial and psychological science
has progressed leaps and bounds in the
last 50 years, but access to that train-
ing is expensive, and we must break
down cost barriers for law enforcement
agencies to save lives and address men-
tal illness.
Mr. Chair, I look forward to, and
urge, support on this amendment that
will make our communities safer and
address mental illness.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.

Mr. GOLDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, I rise to offer this amend-
ment to H.R. 3055 on behalf of my col-
league, Representative ANDY KIM.
Over the past decade, more than 400
Veteran Treatment Courts have been
established across our country. These
courts address a serious problem to
those who served. For veterans with
post-traumatic stress, substance abuse
simply compounds the issues that they
face on a daily basis.
More than 2 out of 10 veterans with
post-traumatic stress also experience
substance abuse problems. These are
service men and women who gave much
to our country, only to come back and
struggle long after their time in uni-
form has come to an end.
As representatives of a grateful Na-
tion, we owe them solutions to the
problems they face. Veteran Treatment
Courts have been that solution for
thousands of veterans and they con-
tinue to be so.
That is why this amendment would
increase funding for this lifesaving pro-
gram by $1 million. That is funding to
help provide an alternative to incarcer-
ation for those in need. That is funding
to help improve access to mental
health services and rehabilitative care.
That is funding to improve the
functionality of our local VA services
and better serve those who served us.
This is a proven program that ad-
dresses a critical need in a community
that has given much to this country.
Let’s join together today to give some-
thing back to them.
With that, I urge adoption of this
commonsense amendment. I have seen
these courts at work in such positive
ways amongst my brothers and sisters
who served in the military.
I want to thank Representative ANDY
KIM for offering this amendment, and I
yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Chair, when I visit a synagogue
or Jewish community center in my
congressional district these days, I
usually pass by an armed security
guard. Inside, there is talk about safe
exit routes and the cost of adding bul-
letproof glass and other security en-
hancements.
When I visit mosques during Friday
prayers, I have noticed that State Po-
lice officers generally, these days, are
standing watch outside. My friends at
Hindu and Sikh temples are worried as
well.
There is a lot of angry, intolerant
rhetoric in the United States and other
countries like ours these days, and we
know it comes from all sides of the po-
litical spectrum, but the guards at the
gates of places of worship are not there
because of a general fear of intoler-
ance. They are there because of a spe-
cific threat from a specific group of
people.
Domestic terrorists, white suprema-

If this threat came from outside the
United States, we would be consumed
by it here in Congress, as we were when
we awoke to the urgency of reorienting
our national and homeland security
strategy to fight al-Qaida after 9/11.
That it is coming from within, from
our fellow Americans, makes it more
sensitive but no less urgent, and there
is more work to be done.
Though the FBI acknowledges that
domestic terrorists claim more lives in
the United States than international
terrorists, it has told us that its coun-

official for dealing with its Domestic
Terrorism Counsel runs what is basi-
cally a one-man operation. And in the
last 2 years we have actually cut fund-
ing at the Department of Homeland Se-
curity to counter domestic violent ex-
tremism.
This amendment begins to correct
the imbalance. It would add $1 million
to the budget of DOJ’s National Secu-
rity Division to be directed to the Do-
mestic Terrorism Counsel. In the un-
derlying bill, we already recommend
that the Counsel be elevated to have a
Deputy Assistant Attorney General
with adequate staff and resources.
The goal is to give a senior official at
the Justice Department the stature
and the tools needed to lead this effort
so that we can focus as much attention
on the rising threat of domestic ter-
rorism as we have rightly devoted to
the threat from groups like al-Qaida
and ISIS.
So let us do more than just condemn
anti-Semitism and other forms of hate-
ful intolerance in this body. Let us ac-
tually do something practical to pro-
tect people from violence.
Mr. Chair, I urge bipartisan support
for this amendment, and look forward
to working with my colleagues on all
sides to advance this goal in the year
ahead.
I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chair, I rise today
to offer an amendment that would pro-
vide an additional $1 million increase
to the NASA Office of Science, Tech-
nology, Engineering, and Mathematics
Engagement for the purpose of sup-
porting the National Space Grant Col-
lege and Fellowship Program also
known as Space Grant.
I first want to thank Chairman
SERRANO and the House Appropriations
Committee for providing $48 million for
the Space Grant Program, especially
given that the President’s fiscal year
2020 budget request proposed an entire
elimination of not only the Space
Grant Program, but also the entire Of-
fice of STEM Engagement.
Founded in 1989, the NASA Space
Grant Program is made up of a na-
tional network of colleges and univer-
sities. It is a program that inspires,
educates, and develops America’s fu-
ture technological workforce with
hands-on projects, courses, and re-
search, ensuring that our next genera-
tion is excited and equipped to thrive
in our Nation’s aeronautics and space
programs.
I would be remiss if I didn’t say that
my district, Colorado’s Second Dis-
trict, which I am proud to represent, is
home to three Space Grant consortium
members: Colorado State University in
Fort Collins; the University of Colo-
rado in Boulder; and Front Range Com-
munity College.
These institutions support almost 300
students, preparing them for successful
STEM careers. In April, I was proud to
lead a bipartisan letter with the entire
Colorado delegation in support of this
program.
The program doesn’t just provide
benefits to my home State, but to the
entire country, Space Grants consist of
over 850 affiliates and 52 total con-
sortia across the country. There is one
in every State, as well as the District
of Columbia.
From reaching Mars, to exploring the
depths of the galaxy, if we want to en-
sure that our Nation remains on a path
of discovery and innovation, we must
invest in our students and education.
With that, I urge my colleagues to
support the amendment before them,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chair, I claim
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment, although I do not oppose the
amendment.

Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chair, I rise in

tive impacts of NASA’s Space Grant
College and Fellowship Program in my
home State of Alabama, and because of
the good work that has come out of
that, I urge adoption of the amend-
ment, to further our students’ STEM
education opportunities. I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chair, I want to
thank the gentleman from Alabama,
and as he articulated, I think there is
incredible work happening with respect
to the Space Grant Program in his
State, in my State, and in States
across the country.
With that, I appreciate the ability to
offer the amendment, and I urge a
‘‘yes’’ vote.
I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chair, I rise today
in support of funding for a critical, life-
saving program, the National Instant
Criminal Background Check System,
or NICS. We know that background
checks save lives.
Since the NICS background check
system was put into effect, over 38 mil-
lion background checks have been con-
ducted, preventing over 3 million fire-
arm purchases from ending up in the
wrong hands.
In 2018, Colorado conducted 340,816
checks against the NICS system with
6,279 denials. Making sure that guns
are not sold to people who should not
have them is one of the most impor-
tant things we can do to prevent gun
violence. But we can, and we must do
more to strengthen the background
check system.
The dangers of an incomplete system
are clear. Just about 2 years ago in No-
vember of 2017, a gunman walked into a
church in Sutherland Springs, Texas,
and fatally shot more than two dozen
people.
The shooter was prohibited from
owning a firearm due to a domestic vi-
olence conviction he received while
serving in the military, but the Air
Force failed to upload the proper
record to NICS, and the gunman was
able to pass a background check and
purchase the firearm that he used in
that massacre.
In response to that incident, this
body authorized additional funds to

support the efforts of States and Fed-
eral agencies to submit critical crimi-
nal history and mental health records
to NICS. The need for these funds was
underscored just 2 months ago in April
in my home State of Colorado.
A Florida woman who should not
have been able to buy a gun and could
not have bought one in her home State,
traveled to Colorado, passed a back-
ground check, and purchased a shot-
gun. Schools around the region were
forced to close as authorities searched
for the woman following credible
threats made to schools across the
Front Range.
These episodes underscore why it is
so critically important that we in-
crease funding for the NICS program so
that we can continue to enhance it and
improve it, and ultimately save lives.
I urge my colleagues to support this
important amendment to try to pre-
vent gun violence in our country. And
with that, I yield back the balance of

and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York.
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Chair, I
rise today to offer an amendment mov-
ing $5 million from the Drug Enforce-
ment Administration into the Com-
prehensive Opioid Abuse Program,
which is part of the Department of Jus-
tice funding of initiatives to combat
the opioid epidemic.
I offer this amendment because end-
ing the war on drugs has to mean
changing our priorities in order to keep
all communities safe and healthy. The
best way we do that is by offering peo-
ple the help and support they need be-
fore arrest and criminalization should
be considered in the first place.
The amendment is a relatively com-
monsense one. As of now, the DEA will
be funded at $2.36 billion, which is
nearly a $90 million 1-year increase and
$77.7 million above even the President’s
request.
The Bronx has an unprecedented
opioid crisis with deadly overdoses
nearly doubling in just a few years. As
families across our Nation know, the
opioid crisis is not limited just to the
Bronx. Just yesterday in the Oversight
and Reform Committee, we heard testi-
mony from medical experts and pro-
viders, and the testimony from Nurse
Gray from West Virginia struck me.
She said that we cannot arrest our-
selves out of this. We have to make
sure that we are caring for people in
order to prevent this crisis from ex-
ploding.
Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from New York (Mr.
SERRANO).
Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chair, I rise in
strong support of my colleague from
the Bronx’s amendment.
Opioids are a serious threat to the
health and well-being of our commu-
nities, and we must do everything we
can to combat this epidemic.
Within the Department of Justice
grant programs, the bill provides $501
million in funding, an increase of $33
million for grants to combat the crisis.
This funding includes drug and vet-
erans courts, residential treatment,
and for the first time, a grant program
for Law Enforcement Assistance Diver-
sion, or LEAD, which seeks to get indi-
viduals into treatment and out of the
criminal justice system.
The addition of this amendment fur-
ther strengthens a bill that increases
grants for treatment and prevention.
Mr. Chair, I support the amendment,
and I urge my colleagues to do the
same.
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chair, I claim
the time in opposition, although I am
not opposed to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Alabama is
recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chair, it should
be noted here that the comprehensive
opioid addiction grants in this bill have
been increased by 360 percent since
they were created in 2017. Of course,
opioid abuse and addiction is a very big
problem in this country, and, cer-
tainly, we need to work on that, so I do
not oppose the gentlewoman’s amend-
ment.
But please know, it should be noted
that we have increased this by 360 per-
cent, but we want to work with both
sides to make sure that we have the ap-
propriate funds necessary to make sure
we fight this opioid addiction that has
taken over so many parts of the coun-
try.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Chair, I
think in that common spirit and our
desire to make sure that we address
the opioid epidemic, just as the epi-
demic is exploding, so should our com-
mitment to address this problem.
This amendment is supported by the
NAACP, the ACLU, the Drug Policy Al-
liance, and dozens of other organiza-
tions. Again, this is a relatively com-
monsense amendment. We have over-
funded one agency, and we should move
that to make sure we are getting peo-
ple the care that they need.

Ms. OMAR. Mr. Chair, I rise today in
support of my amendment to H.R. 3055.
My amendment addresses the mis-
guided use of solitary confinement
within our Nation’s prison systems and
the harmful impact it has on incarcer-
ated populations.
Solitary confinement is torture. For
people with mental health issues, land-
ing in solitary not only produces be-
haviors that yield more time in soli-
tary, but it can also extend prison sen-
tences, sometimes drastically. For
these already vulnerable people, soli-
tary confinement generates a cycle of
punishment that for some can literally
be endless.
In many prisons in this country, the
de facto penalty for even minor prison
rules violations, including those obvi-
ously caused by psychological distress
or disability, has become solitary con-
finement. The isolation of solitary al-
most inevitably causes a measurable
deterioration in mental health, which
in turn leads to more behavioral issues
punished with more solitary confine-
ment.
Oftentimes, someone who was only
supposed to spend a couple of years in
prison ends up spending the rest of
their life there, or they end up return-
ing because they have been so damaged
by solitary confinement that they
can’t adjust to life outside of prison.
This vicious cycle of violence must
end. Individuals with underlying psy-
chological disabilities are already over-
represented in prisons and jails, and
this inhumane, inexcusable punish-
ment is only perpetuating those prob-
lems. That is why we must put an end
to solitary confinement once and for
all.
I believe that, together, we can re-
form this cycle.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4937
June 20, 2019
Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
New York (Mr. SERRANO).
Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chair, I rise to
support the amendment. My colleague
sends an important message by calling
attention to the misuse and overuse of
solitary confinement in Federal correc-
tion and detention.
In 2016, the National Institute of Jus-
tice issued a detailed study of the use
of restrictive housing in U.S. deten-
tion. In addition, the Office of Inspec-
tor General in 2017 reported on the use
of restrictive housing for mentally ill
persons in the custody of BOP and in-
cluded 15 recommendations to improve
how BOP treats such inmates.
While solitary confinement rep-
resents a small percentage of restric-
tive housing, it is particularly con-
cerning because of evidence that its use
can be harmful and even counter-
productive to correctional objectives.
Mr. Chair, I encourage the Depart-
ment to take note of the concerns ex-
pressed here, and I ask that the amend-
ment be adopted.
Ms. OMAR. Mr. Chair, I urge support,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Alabama is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chair, the goal
of the Department of Justice is to
house inmates in the least restrictive
environment that is possible and at the
same time provide safety and security
for the staff, for the inmate population,
and to the public in general.
Just as in the community, disruptive
individuals occasionally need to be
placed in a jail or a holding facility to
maintain the safety of its residents.
The Bureau of Prisons has to place dis-
ruptive inmates in restrictive housing
in order to maintain safety and secu-
rity for the overall well-being of all the
inmates.
The appropriate and reasonable use
of restrictive housing is critical to the
safety of the staff and to the Bureau’s
policies and procedures, and they try
to strike an appropriate balance be-
tween the safety of those individuals
who are on the staff there working at
the Bureau of Prisons but also for the
inmates themselves.
Restrictive housing involves two in-
mates per cell, in the vast majority of
cases, and the inmates have daily ac-
cess to staff and to programming. It is
only in very rare cases that inmates
are in a single cell in restrictive hous-
ing—for example, an inmate who has
killed a cellmate or an inmate who has
made repetitive or credible threats to
kill anyone who is housed with him.
Every year, we mourn the loss of
dedicated corrections professionals
who lose their lives while they are
working to ensure our Nation’s in-
mates can no longer harm members of
the community and harm each other.
We must not attempt to substitute
our judgment here on this House floor
for that of the highly trained correc-
tions professionals at the Bureau of
Prisons and the United States Mar-
shals Service. I think to do so would be
a disservice and would make their jobs
even more dangerous.
Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I rise today
to offer an amendment to the fiscal
year 2020 appropriations bill that would
increase funding for the court-ap-
pointed special advocate, or CASA, and
guardian ad litem programs.
In 2017, nine out of every 1,000 Amer-
ican children were victims of abuse or
neglect. These experiences have a last-
ing effect, impacting a child’s future in
ways that are often not apparent in the
days, weeks, or months after the trau-
ma of abuse or neglect occurs. Pro-
viding support and advocacy for these
children can make an enormous dif-
ference in their lives, and that is where
the CASA program comes in.
CASA serves abused, neglected, and
abandoned children through the re-
cruitment and training of volunteers
who advocate on behalf of children in
courtrooms and other settings.
Mr. Chair, imagine being a 6-year-old
child suffering from parental abuse.
Home is not a safe place, and the secret
that you, at only 6 years old, carry
with you every day prevents you from
speaking to your friends and your
teachers and keeps you from making
friends and building relationships.
Now, Mr. Chair, imagine that a
neighbor calls the police after over-
hearing abuse. You are finally removed
from a home that is filled with trau-
matic memories, but you are now look-
ing at a scary and uncertain future in
the foster system, and you will have to
face your abuser in court.
That is where the CASA program
comes in. They step in to provide a life-
line, a guide, a friend, and an advocate
for the child. Every year, more than
85,000 volunteers advocate on behalf of
the 260,000 children who experience
abuse and neglect. CASA advocates
help these children find their voices or
even speak for them as they navigate
the child welfare system.
CASA of Orange County has worked
with more than 7,050 children in the 34
years that the program has served our
community, and they have trained
nearly 3,500 volunteers.
CASA of Orange County used essen-
tial funding to support Malena, an 11-
year-old Orange County resident diag-
nosed with autism. In the 21⁄2 years
that she was in foster care, Malena
lived in a group home, a foster home, a
nurturing relative placement, and then
a group home again. Throughout all of
those changes, Malena had one con-
sistent person in her life that she knew
she could count on, her court-ap-
pointed special advocate.
That CASA was a steady force in at-
tending countless meetings with her
team to support and advocate for her
needs. But her relationship with her
CASA was so much more, teaching her
things that she missed in childhood,
such as how to tie her shoes, how to
count money, how to write her name,
and when her birthday was.
At CASA of Orange County and other
CASAs across the country, their
mantra is ‘‘I am for the child.’’
As a mother of three children, I am
proud to stand here as an advocate for
children in Orange County and across
the country who experience abuse and
neglect.

my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4938 June 20, 2019
I have 5 minutes to speak about my
amendment today, and during this
time, three people in this country will
suffer sexual assault.
b 1130
That works out to every 92 seconds
someone is sexually assaulted in our
country. Let me repeat that: every 92
seconds. And, in most cases, the per-
petrators of these sexual assaults will
never be held accountable. According
to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National
Network, only 5 out of every 1,000 rap-
ists will end up in prison.
We have an opportunity today to sup-
port victims of sexual assault by in-
creasing funding to process the backlog
of sexual assault kits that are waiting
to be tested across the country. Having
the data and information that a sexual
assault kit can provide is essential to
solving sexual assaults and preventing
future assaults.
In my home State of California, there
are 13,615 kits untested. We are failing
every single one of those 13,615 victims
whose rape kit is sitting and waiting
for our attention, and we are failing
tens of thousands more across the
country, including those who will be
sexually assaulted by a perpetrator
whose DNA will sit untested for a
crime already committed.
It costs an average of $1,000 and $1,500
to test a single rape kit. The lack of
critical funding needed for these test-
ing kits is the primary factor in the
ever-growing backlog of untested kits.
In 2016, the Department of Justice’s
Bureau of Justice Assistance gave Or-
ange County a nearly $2 million grant
to process more than 3,500 unprocessed
kits, to investigate and prosecute
cases, and to reengage survivors.
My amendment, which increases the
funding in this legislation by $1 mil-
lion, could help test approximately an-
other 1,000 rape kits in California and
across the country. The amendment
would bring the total funding up to $50
million, which will only provide
enough Federal funding for the testing
of up to 50,000 kits. While that is
enough to give answers to the 13,000
sexual assault victims waiting for anal-
ysis and help in California, because of a
lack of data nationwide, we don’t know
exactly how many sexual assault kits
are waiting in this country.
This funding likely isn’t enough, and
we know that. But Congress must do
more to ensure that we are supporting
the victims of sexual assault in this
country. Increasing funding can play
an important role, while it is not alone
enough.
We need to support our State and
local partners in addressing the back-
log of rape kits through increased fund-
ing, through new policies for kit test-
ing, and through improved training for
those in the field.
I hope that this increase in funding
helps us continue the conversation and
raise more awareness about sexual as-
sault and about the kit backlog.
I hope that survivors of sexual as-
sault know that Members of Congress
are fighting for them, and I hope they
hear me and believe that this fight for
justice won’t end with this amend-
ment. We need to support the victims
of sexual assault across this country
who deserve to have their kits tested,
who deserve justice. We can and must
do more.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to

AMENDMENT NO. 83 OFFERED BY MS. PRESSLEY
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order

in part B of House Report 116–119.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.

The Chair recognizes the gentle-

Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Chair, during a
recent Oversight and Reform Com-
mittee hearing, of which I am a mem-
ber, on Ban the Box, an advocate and
formerly incarcerated mother testified
that ‘‘People do not go to prison; fami-
lies do.’’
From personal experience and a ca-
reer spent in community and advo-
cating on behalf of families desta-
bilized by mass incarceration, I know
firsthand the trauma that comes from
having a parent involved in the crimi-
nal justice system.
We must break the chains that keep
families ensnarled by the mass incar-
ceration system generation after gen-
eration. We must end the prison indus-
trial complex that has brought so
much devastation and trauma to many
families and communities.
As many as 2.7 million children have
at least one parent in prison or jail.
That is 1 in 9 Black children, 1 in 28
Latino children, and 1 in 57 White chil-
dren. Too many children are bearing
the trauma, the shame, and the stigma
that often comes along with having a
parent or caregiver incarcerated.
In the Massachusetts Seventh, which
I am fortunate to represent, a Boston
reentry study that tracked formerly
incarcerated men and women found
that over half of respondents had less
than $400 in their pockets upon release
from prison; about a third went to un-
stable or temporary housing in shelters
and transitional housing programs,
motels, or on the street; and fewer
than half were in paid employment
after 2 months.
Mass incarceration and the lingering
effects of a criminal record have a pro-
found impact on families. From unem-
ployment and financial instability to
eviction and hunger for families in-
volved in our criminal injustice sys-
tem, incarceration is, quite literally, a
shared sentence.
As lawmakers, as mothers, as fa-
thers, as brothers, as sisters, we can
and must do better.
My amendment would increase funds
to support the Children of Incarcerated
Parents Program and help reduce the
harms of parental incarceration and al-
leviate generational trauma. In the
wealthiest Nation on Earth, we must
ensure that all families can truly have
a second chance. Funding for these pro-
grams will help provide that.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.
PRESSLEY).

This program provides crucial funding

maintains strong community infra-
structure. Each neighborhood has its
own resident coalition that is coordi-
nated by a local organization with deep
ties to the community.
VIP, like other similar programs,
empowers communities by providing
the knowledge and resources necessary
to create long-term solutions to the
persistent socioeconomic and systemic
issues sustaining the public health epi-
demic of gun violence.
Violence begets violence. Whether it
is domestic violence, sexual violence,
gun violence, or gang and street vio-
lence, we must stop treating it as an
issue of law and order but, rather, in-
vest in the public and social needs of
our most vulnerable people and com-
munities.
My amendment will support initia-
tives that are led and informed by the
community to help stem the violence
devastating our communities. It cen-
ters those closest to the pain closest to
the power and the solutions.
Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues
to support my amendment, and I yield

The Chair recognizes the gentle-

Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Chair, I rise
today in support of my amendment to
H.R. 3055.
This bipartisan amendment removes
and adds $2 million from the Legal Ac-
tivities account at the Department of
Justice.
I would like to make the intent of
this amendment clear, that Congress is
directing the DOJ’s Environment and
Natural Resources Division to allocate
$2 million to enforce our Nation’s ani-
mal welfare laws.
Congress has taken meaningful steps
over the past several decades, and espe-
cially in the past few years, to improve
animal welfare and rid this country of
heartless cruelty toward animals.
These improvements include the pas-
sage of legislation like the Horse Pro-
tection Act, the crush video law, the
Animal Welfare Act and animal fight-
ing laws, which received overwhelming
bipartisan support.
While our animal rights laws have
improved, there are currently insuffi-
cient resources to ensure that these
laws are being adequately enforced.
The Environment and Natural Re-
sources Division, or ENRD, oversees
many important functions, including
pollution cleanup and wildlife protec-
tion. This division also has the unique
responsibility to prosecute animal wel-
fare crimes. ENRD lawyers at the De-
partment of Justice are doing the best
they can to defend the humane treat-
ment of captive, farmed, and com-
panion animals across the country, but
there are currently not enough re-
sources being allocated for them to go
after animal welfare crimes.
Failure to adequately enforce these
laws harms communities and animals—
the truly voiceless. Failure to enforce
these laws leaves animals to suffer tre-
mendously at the hands of people who
force animals to fight to the death for
pure entertainment and/or other cruel
actions.
Mr. Chair, I use this opportunity to
urge DOJ to coordinate with USDA and
continue working with the U.S. Attor-
ney’s offices to prosecute and inves-
tigate animal welfare crimes. Specifi-
cally, DOJ should create a dedicated
animal cruelty crimes unit and allow
for robust enforcement of animal wel-
fare crimes. There should be dedicated
personnel, including prosecutors, fo-
cused solely on these offenses.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment.
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from Florida (Mr. CRIST).
b 1145
Mr. CRIST. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms.
STEVENS) for her incredible leadership
on an issue we should all be able to
agree upon: protecting all of God’s
creatures, great and small.
When Congress creates laws, we in-
tend for them to be enforced. That is
pretty simple. The Stevens amendment
would help the Department of Justice
do exactly that.
This issue is bigger than senseless
animal abuse. There is an established
link between animal fighting and abuse
and drug trafficking and gang activity.
This means that laws protecting ani-
mals also protect our communities.
This amendment is common sense,
and I urge support.
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Chairman, I yield
back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Ms. STE-
VENS).
The question was taken; and the Act-

AMENDMENT NO. 89 OFFERED BY MS.

The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 89 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of Division A (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. lll. None of the funds made avail-
able by this Act may be used by the Depart-
ment of Justice to argue, in the conduct of
any litigation to which the United States, or
an agency or officer thereof is a party, that
any provision of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111–148; 124
Stat. 119) or of the Health Care and Edu-
cation Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Public
Law 111–152), is unconstitutional or is invalid
or unenforceable on any ground, including
that certain provisions of the Patient Pro-
tection and Affordable Care Act are not sev-
erable from section 5000A of that Act.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentlewoman
from Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Illinois.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Chair, I rise
today in support of my amendment,
which will prevent Federal funds from
being used by the Department of Jus-
tice to undermine the Affordable Care
Act.
The people of the Illinois 14th elected
me to protect coverage for preexisting
conditions and to make healthcare and
prescription drugs more affordable.
Under this administration, the Depart-
ment of Justice is refusing to defend
the law of the land, risking access to
affordable care for 130 million Ameri-
cans with preexisting conditions, in-
cluding 5.4 million Illinoisans.
If this administration succeeds in
overturning the Affordable Care Act
through the courts, it would destroy
protections for people with preexisting
conditions, the ban on lifetime and an-
nual limits on health coverage, the
Medicaid expansion covering 15 million
Americans, health insurance afford-
ability tax credits assisting 9 million
Americans, bans on discriminatory in-
surance practices that force women to
pay more for coverage, young adults’
ability to remain on their parents’ in-
surance until 26, and more.
This is unacceptable, and to do it on
the dime of the taxpayer is unconscion-
able.
130 million Americans depend on it,
and one of those Americans is Mike
DeBow, of Shorewood, Illinois. Mike
has type 1 diabetes and wrote to me be-
cause he is ‘‘deathly afraid’’ of losing
his insurance. He is thankful for the
protections of the Affordable Care Act
that allow him to stay on his parents’
plan and ensure insurance companies
can’t discriminate against him because
of his preexisting condition.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4940 June 20, 2019
We cannot go back, back to the days
before the Affordable Care Act when in-
surers were in the driver’s seat, al-
lowed to sell substandard plans that
didn’t cover the care people needed,
and left patients holding the bag. We
cannot go back to the days when 50
million people in this country were un-
insured, locked out because of pre-
existing conditions.
The American people sent a resound-
ing message last November: They want
their healthcare protected. They want
their healthcare to be affordable. We
should be working toward that aim,
not using taxpayer dollars to try to
sabotage it for political gain.
For example, we passed legislation in
this House that would protect people
with preexisting conditions, H.R. 1010,
and another bill, the Health Care Af-
fordability Act, that I proposed, which
would reduce premium costs for ap-
proximately 20 million Americans and
offer at least 9 million people who are
currently uninsured lower cost cov-
erage.
That is what we should be doing for
the American people: using our offices
to make their lives better, healthier,
safer, and more affordable. For some,
like Mike DeBow, this is literally life
and death.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chair, I claim
time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Alabama is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
This administration remains com-
mitted to providing more affordable
healthcare options to all Americans,
and debating the prospects of future ju-
dicial action will not help us, as a Con-
gress, deliver on our promise to bring
better healthcare to our constituents.
The administration has promised to en-
sure that, regardless of the outcome,
they will support the legislation to ad-
dress any legal determination.
In addition, let me say, it is not ap-
propriate for Congress to tell the exec-
utive branch what positions it should
take in court. Litigation strategy is
the responsibility and the prerogative
of the Department of Justice.
As the Attorney General recently
testified during one of our committee
hearings here on Capitol Hill, he said
that they should be able to advance
what he believes are defensible and rea-
sonable legal positions, and I believe
that certainly to be the case.
The Attorney General has concluded
that the position of the States that
challenge the ACA and the district
courts is a defensible and reasonable
legal position for the Department to
take.
Questions of constitutionality should
be determined by the courts and not
through a partisan debate on funding
limitation to an appropriations bill.
So, therefore, Mr. Chair, I would urge a
‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Chair, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. SERRANO).
Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Chair, I rise to
support the amendment.
When, in March, the Justice Depart-
ment broke with the principle that its
core mission should be to defend, not
sabotage, the law of the land, it went
too far.
The White House is entitled to push
its own policy position on healthcare—
it has made no secret of its hostility to
the Affordable Care Act, despite never
offering an alternative of any kind—
but it cannot pick and choose which
laws to support.
My friends across the aisle criticized
the Obama administration for its use of
prosecutorial discretion. In this case,
the Department is not just neglecting
to defend the law, it is using appro-
priated funds to directly attack it.
This amendment will, hopefully, stop
that, and that is why I strongly sup-
port it.
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Chairman, I
ask all my colleagues to support this
amendment, and I thank the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ALLRED) for
his leadership in introducing legisla-
tion at the beginning of this Congress
that allowed this body, the U.S. House
of Representatives, to defend the Af-
fordable Care Act in the existing litiga-
tion.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Illinois (Ms. UNDER-
WOOD).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Chairman, I
demand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentlewoman from Illinois will be
postponed.
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chairman, I
rise as the designee of the gentle-
woman from Texas, and I move to
strike the last word.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Alabama is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chairman, I
yield to the gentleman from Florida
(Mr. SPANO).
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today to thank Ranking Member ADER-
HOLT and Chairman SERRANO for work-
ing together on the bipartisan en bloc
package that passed the House yester-
day. That package included my amend-
ment to increase funding for the Inter-
national Trade Administration by $2
million to provide additional funding
for enforcement and compliance activi-
ties.
Unfair trade practices directly harm
our domestic manufacturing and agri-
cultural sectors. The U.S. Customs and
Border Protection reports that there
are nearly 55,000 unpaid antidumping
and countervailing duty bills covering
fiscal years 2011 through 2016, totaling
$2.8 billion in uncollected duties. This
is a critical issue for my district.
Americans who eat U.S.-grown straw-
berries in the colder winter months are
probably eating a strawberry grown
and harvested by the hardworking
farmers in Plant City, Florida. We are
proud of our role in providing Ameri-
cans access to U.S.-grown produce
year-round.
However, the strawberry growers in
my district are under attack. They are
under attack from illegal ‘‘dumping’’
practices, and this must be stopped.
The additional funding provided by my
amendment is a step in the right direc-
tion to combat unfair trade practices
so that U.S. producers can compete.
Again, I want to express my grati-
tude to Ranking Member ADERHOLT
and Chairman SERRANO for including
this amendment in the en bloc package
that passed the House yesterday.
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Georgia (Mr. BISHOP) and the gen-
tleman from Nebraska (Mr. FORTEN-
BERRY) each will control 10 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Georgia.
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam
Chair, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
The amendments included in the en
bloc were made in order by the rule,
and they have been agreed to by both
sides. They improve the bill. I support
the amendment, and I urge its adop-
tion.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Chair, I
rise in support of the en bloc amend-
ment as well.
I want to thank the Agriculture Sub-
committee chairman, Mr. BISHOP, for
working with our side to include many
amendments that are important to our
Members. The chairman has been a
great partner and has been very fair
throughout this process.
I urge my colleagues to support the
amendment, as it reflects the will of
many Members and also makes appro-
priate changes to the bill.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam
Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Alabama (Ms. SEWELL).
b 1200
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam
Chair, I would like to thank so much
the subcommittee chairperson, Mr.
BISHOP, for allowing me this time.
My amendment is part of the en bloc,
and it deals with wastewater treat-
ment.
No person in America and living in
this country should be allowed to not
have adequate plumbing. This is why I
have introduced an amendment asking
the USDA to prioritize our ongoing ef-
forts to address failing septic systems
in rural communities.
Approximately 20 percent of Ameri-
cans are responsible for the installa-
tion and maintenance of their own sew-
age disposal systems, which isn’t pro-
vided by their municipalities or their
county government. At least 200,000
families live in homes that lack a sew-
age system altogether.
We offer little assistance to people
who live in unincorporated areas to
have basic water and sewer. Rural com-
munities across this country struggle
with this issue.
Just this week, I read lots and lots of
articles that dealt with the failure of
those folks in rural communities to
have adequate sewage systems.
This amendment is part of a
multiyear effort to address this once
and for all for all Americans.
Last year, my bill, the Rural Septic
Tank Access Act, was included in the
farm bill.
Madam Chair, I thank Chairman
BISHOP and his staff for allowing me to
speak on this underlying en bloc bill
today.
In fiscal year 2018, we secured an ad-
ditional $1.8 billion in rural wastewater
funding with the help of Congressman
ADERHOLT.
Madam Chair, again, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ for this en bloc
amendment.
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Chair, I

Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS).
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Chair, I thank my colleague
and ranking member, Mr. FORTEN-

man BISHOP for including my amend-
ment in the en bloc amendments.

a 5 percent increase in funding for the
USDA’s National Institute of Food and
Agriculture. That program had seen in-
creased funding because of bipartisan
support on the House Agriculture Com-
mittee from many of the members, in-
cluding my good friend and fellow co-
chair of the Ag Research Caucus,
JIMMY PANETTA of California, who
fondly likes to remind us all that he
represents the Salad Bowl of America.
This year, I led a bipartisan letter
signed by 111 of my colleagues advo-
cating for robust funding for USDA
NIFA’s Agriculture and Food Research
Initiative in the 2020 appropriations
and I am extremely excited that the
House appropriators increased funding
by $45 million over fiscal year 2019 lev-
els to $460 million for NIFA and AFRI.
I am proud to see such bipartisan
support for ag research, because ensur-
ing research is necessary and vital.
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam
Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. TRONE).
Mr. TRONE. Madam Chair, I am
pleased that the four amendments I
proposed to this bill will be made in
order. These amendments reflect some
of the most important priorities in my
district.
First, they offer an amendment to in-
crease funding for mental health
courts, which lower the recidivism rate
for justice-impacted individuals with
mental illness.
My second amendment underlines the
importance of modernizing the Na-
tional Institute of Standards and Tech-
nology’s infrastructure. This funding
will help NIST remain a leader in driv-
ing economic growth in Maryland’s
Sixth District and across the country.
The last two amendments put addi-
tional funding toward expanding rural
broadband deployment and combatting
the opioid crisis in rural communities,
two critical priorities of western Mary-
land.
Madam Chair, I thank Representa-
tives Riggleman of Virginia and Neguse
of Colorado for working with me on
these amendments.
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Chair, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Wisconsin (Mr. STEIL), a member of the
Financial Services Committee.
Mr. STEIL. Madam Chair, I thank
my colleague from Nebraska and my
colleague, Mr. BISHOP, for including
this amendment in the en bloc.
I rise to support my amendment to
support our dairy industry. I have vis-
ited farms across southeast Wisconsin,
and time and time again, farmers have
explained to me the challenges they
have with consistently low milk prices.
That is why we need this amend-
ment, so we can continue to invest in
business development within the dairy
industry and encourage new markets
for our farmers.
This amendment provides $1.5 million
to support our Nation’s dairy industry
in a budget neutral way.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support our dairy industry, to sup-
port our farmers, and to support this
amendment.
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Chair, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Virginia (Mr. RIGGLEMAN).
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentleman from Maryland,
Representative TRONE, with whom I
have developed a bipartisan partner-
ship that has resulted in these two
amendments.
The first amendment increases fund-
ing for Community Connect Grants to
connect broadband deployment into
rural communities that are under-
served by private sector investment.
Our rural communities, including
some in my district, need access to
broadband to keep up with the de-
mands of the modern economy.
This amendment will help commu-
nities close the digital divide, which is
critical to enhancing economic oppor-
tunity, job creation, access to
healthcare, and education in rural
America.
The next amendment, dear to my
heart, increases funding for the Rural
Health and Safety Education Program
to combat the opioid epidemic in rural
communities.
Representative TRONE and I and too
many others in this body and in our
country at large have seen friends and
family members suffer and even pass
away from the opioid crisis that has
ravaged our country. Just last week, I
lost my cousin to a heroin overdose.
This funding is an essential step to
turn the crisis around.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support these two amendments.
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Chair, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZÁLEZ-
COLÓN).
Miss GONZÁLEZ-COLÓN of Puerto
Rico. Madam Chair, I thank Ranking
Member FORTENBERRY and Chairman
BISHOP for including in this en bloc
group amendment my bipartisan
amendment No. 103 to provide funding
for the Reimbursement Transportation
Cost Payment Program for Geographi-
cally Disadvantaged Farmers and
Ranchers.
This program in USDA will reim-
burse farmers and ranchers in Puerto
Rico, as well as in other U.S. foreign
territories, Hawaii and Alaska, a por-
tion of the costs that they may incur
when transporting their agricultural
products or equipment.
Our farmers and ranchers outside the
continental U.S. operate at a competi-
tive disadvantage relative to producers
in the 48 contiguous States, partly due
to geographic barriers and high trans-
portation costs.
This program will help us address
this reality by providing payments to
help ranchers and farmers in the non-
contiguous States or territories offset
some of these costs.
This program has been funded at $1.9
million over the last couple of fiscal
years, and my amendment will seek to
provide the same amount of funding for
fiscal year 2020, with a corresponding
offset.
Madam Chair, I want to thank Rep-
resentatives GABBARD of Hawaii,
PLASKETT of the U.S. Virgin Islands,
and RADEWAGEN of American Samoa
for cosponsoring my amendment, and I
urge my colleagues to endorse it.
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Chair,
there are no further speakers, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam
Chair, at this time, I ask my colleagues
to join me in support of this amend-
ment.
Madam Chair, we have no more
speakers, and I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Chair, my amendment
is intended to ensure that the Northern Mar-
iana Islands Nutritional Assistance Program
has enough funding, so that household in-
come eligibility standards and benefit levels
currently in place for FY19 are kept in place
throughout FY20.
We do not want anyone removed from eligi-
bility or barred from the program because
there is not enough money next year.
We do not want anyone to have their bene-
fits cut. We have worked hard and long to
raise benefits in the Marianas to match neigh-
boring Guam and to meet the true costs of
food in our islands. We do not want that
progress lost.
I do not expect cuts to happen. We provided
generously for the Marianas in the disaster
supplemental appropriation enacted earlier this
month, Public Law 116–20. We appropriated
$25.2 million for disaster nutrition assistance
in response to the Presidentially declared
major disasters—we had two last year: Ty-
phoon Mangkut and Super Typhoon Yutu—
and for emergencies. And we made the funds
available for all fiscal year 2020.
The Marianas had already used $10.6 mil-
lion of our annual block grant and other mon-
ies to pay for disaster nutrition assistance in
response to these two typhoons. It is the in-
tent of Congress that the new disaster funding
in Public Law 116–20 be applied retroactively
to make whole those other funding sources.
Going forward, we are concerned about the
economic emergency that has developed in
the aftermath of the typhoons. Tourism, the
primary driver of the economy, is down signifi-
cantly; and Commonwealth government reve-
nues have fallen. As a result, local govern-
ment employees have had their hours reduced
from 40 to 32 per week. Public school teach-
ers are being forced to agree to a salary cut.
The reduced consumer purchasing power will
accelerate the economic downturn.
During the period of recession and govern-
ment austerity that occurred from 2008
through 2012, the demand on the nutritional
assistance program increased by 44 percent.
This scenario may well now repeat. Congress
recognizes that, because of the nexus be-
tween the typhoon disasters and the subse-
quent economic emergency, any new demand
on the nutritional assistance program in fiscal
year 2020 should be addressed with disaster
funding provided in Public Law 116–20.
It is not certain, however, that the disaster
supplemental appropriation will cover all con-
tingencies.
To prepare for any eventuality, the amend-
ment I offer makes clear that SNAP contin-
gency funds are a permissible source should

the Marianas nutritional assistance program
face a shortfall in fiscal 2020.
It is a ‘‘belt and suspenders’’ proposition.
Only needed if, for some reason, disaster
funds prove insufficient. This use of the contin-
gency funds is statutorily authorized under the
broad discretion given to the Secretary in 48
U.S.C. 1469d(c) to extend to the Marianas any
program administered by the Department of
Agriculture. The Secretary is also authorized
to waive or modify any statutory requirements
relating to the provision of assistance under
such programs when he deems it necessary in
order to adapt the programs to the Marianas
needs.
My amendment makes clear Congress’ in-
tent: that no household eligible for food assist-
ance under the income standards in effect for
FY19 will be denied benefits in FY20 and that
the benefit amounts being provided in FY19
will not be reduced in FY20.
I ask my colleagues to support this amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendments en bloc offered by
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.
BISHOP).
The en bloc amendments were agreed
to.
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 97 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
AMENDMENT NO. 99 OFFERED BY MR. BANKS
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 99 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. BANKS. Madam Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division B (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll. Each amount made available by
this division (other than an amount required
to be made available by a provision of law) is
hereby reduced by 14 percent.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Indiana (Mr. BANKS) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Indiana.
Mr. BANKS. Madam Chair, my
amendment is simple. It would reduce
spending in this division by 14 percent,
the amount that is needed to avoid
busting the budget caps and preventing
sequestration, which would com-
promise our national security.
This division would spend $1.3 billion
more than the 2019 enacted level.
In their quest to spend every tax-
payer dollar from this generation and
our future generations, my friends on
the other side of the aisle have pro-
posed spending packages that in total
will bust the budget caps by nearly $90
billion.
While my colleagues may be willing
to put national security at risk to ful-
fill budget-busting policy promises, I
will not.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support my commonsense amend-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam
Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam
Chair, I understand the gentleman’s in-
tention, but I could not disagree more.
The agriculture bill funds a variety
of national priorities from food safety,
to agriculture research, to drug ap-
proval, to rural development, to nutri-
tion programs for our children.
Reducing spending by 14 percent
would hurt our farmers, who are al-
ready suffering terribly from retalia-
tory tariffs, and it would hurt small
communities who are still in need of
adequate broadband. It would hurt
those who are waiting for cures to rare
cancers. It would jeopardize America’s
status as a leader of global agricultural
science. It would slow our response to
foodborne illness outbreaks. It would
harm children and families who rely on
these programs to put food on their ta-
bles.
The bill already rejected the admin-
istration’s draconian cuts to programs
that assist our rural communities and
vulnerable populations.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to oppose this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. BANKS. Madam Chair, we have
got to think about the audacity of
these claims.
I am not talking in my amendment
about cutting any specific program. I
am proposing an amendment to cut 14
percent across the board to prevent the
excessive spending that we are seeing
being proposed from across the aisle
that would spend substantially more
than what the Federal Government
spent in the year before.
Madam Chair, we simply cannot af-
ford this reckless proposal from my
friends on the other side of the aisle.
My amendment offers Members a
clear choice. If a Member votes ‘‘no,’’
that Member supports busting the
budget caps and putting our national
security at risk due to entering into se-
questration, which is inevitable if we
pass the spending measures being pro-
posed from across the aisle.
However, by supporting my amend-
ment, Members can show that they
support fiscal sanity by honoring the
budget caps and protecting our na-
tional security.
Madam Chair, I will continue to
come back to this microphone over and
over and over again and propose this
same amendment to each nondefense
spending division, because I promised
my constituents in northeast Indiana
that that is exactly what I would do if
they elected me to Congress, that I
would fight to reduce spending to re-
build our military and to support fiscal
sanity in our Nation, once again, by
fighting for balanced budgets and fis-
cally conservative spending measures.

This amendment fulfills all those
promises to my constituents and fami-
lies in northeast Indiana, and I urge
my colleagues to support it.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam
Chair, I urge that this amendment be
rejected.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. BANKS).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. BANKS. Madam Chair, I demand
a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Indiana will be
postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 101 OFFERED BY MR. BIGGS
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 101 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division B (before the short
title) insert the following:
SEC. ll. None of the funds made available
by this Act may be used to finalize, imple-
ment, or enforce the draft guidance issued by
the Food and Drug Administration in De-
cember 2017 titled ‘‘Drug Products Labeled
as Homeopathic: Guidance for FDA Staff and
Industry’’.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman

Mr. BIGGS. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, I rise in support of my
amendment that prevents funds from
being used to finalize, implement, or
enforce the draft guidance issued by
the Food and Drug Administration in
December of 2017, titled, ‘‘Drug Prod-
ucts Labeled as Homeopathic Guidance
for FDA Staff and Industry.’’
The 2017 draft guidance actually
upends three decades of settled en-
forcement practice in homeopathy
without a compelling reason or with no
directive from Congress. My amend-
ment would prevent that overreach and
maintain the safe and effective guid-
ance that has been in place since 1987.
For decades, homeopathy has thrived
as the fastest growing alternative to
pharmaceuticals, and FDA estimates
more than 3 million Americans use it.
The products can be a natural alter-
native to addictive opioids in the man-
agement of pain and other conditions.
The current guidance provides a pre-
cise definition of a homeopathic prod-
uct and clear manufacturing standards.
Violations of these standards are al-
ready subject to FDA enforcement. The

proposed change in guidance goes too
far by restricting access to safe homeo-
pathic medicines, while also being less
effective at regulating the safety and
quality of homeopathic products.
The new guidance replaces clear defi-
nitions with a vague, risk-based ap-
proach. By its own admission, the FDA
failed to consult with consumers and
those in the homeopathic community
before they drafted this guidance. The
result is a poorly worded document
that does not do what it purports to do.
Instead, this guidance covers all
products labeled as homeopathic rather
than distinguishing between those
falsely labeled as homeopathic and
those that are actually homeopathic
medicines which have already been
proven to be safe and effective. As writ-
ten, the guidance threatens to limit ac-
cess to safe and effective homeopathic
medicines by subjecting them to new
enforcement actions inconsistent with
past practice and existing law.
The draft guidance purports to ad-
dress improperly manufactured homeo-
pathic products, and I support that, but
the draft guidance drops the explicit
manufacturing guidelines already con-
tained in the existing guidance. Under
the draft guidance, Americans would
have fewer assurances that their home-
opathic medicines are pure and prop-
erly manufactured.
The problems that FDA cites as rea-
sons for introducing the draft guid-
ance, falsely labeled products and im-
properly manufactured products, are
actually better addressed under the
current guidance, and the FDA has
been effectively addressing these issues
for the last 30 years.
This draft guidance is an unnecessary
regulatory overreach, and I urge all
Members to support this amendment.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Chair, I
rise in opposition to the amendment
primarily to engage in a discussion
with the gentleman from Arizona.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Nebraska is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Chair,
first let me say, I do understand the
concerns of the gentleman from Ari-
zona.
Here is the issue: The Food and Drug
Administration is charged with the re-
sponsibility of ensuring that persons
seeking to be healed have both the
right to try innovative products as well
as the right to be protected from harm
or any false claims.
So let me say to my friend, Mr.
BIGGS, we would like to offer this:
Chairman BISHOP and I would seek the
opportunity to have the FDA, the Food
and Drug Administration, meet with us
to dialogue on the very important
issues that you are raising and to relay
your concerns. I will commit to you
that your objections will be conveyed
to their leadership before they move
forward on this guidance.
So, in light of that consideration, I
kindly, respectfully request that the
gentleman consider withdrawing the
amendment.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentleman for his comments and
Ranking Member FORTENBERRY’s as-
surances that we can get together with
the FDA and see what we can do to re-
solve this very difficult issue. I look
forward to working with him on this
issue going forward.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time and withdraw my
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The amendment
is withdrawn.
AMENDMENT NO. 105 OFFERED BY MR. PENCE
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 105 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. PENCE. Madam Chair, I have an

The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-

Page 111, line 17, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(reduced by $25,000,000)’’.
Page 158, line 3, after the dollar amount,

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman

ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman

Mr. PENCE. Madam Chair, I rise in
support of my amendment to increase
funding for the Distance Learning and
Telemedicine broadband grant pro-
gram.
Currently, over 14 million Americans
living in rural communities still lack
access to basic broadband service. Spe-
cifically, the rural broadband grant
programs at USDA help Americans tap
into telehealth technology, distant
learning education, and internet-based
agribusiness that our farmers des-
perately rely on to remain competi-
tive.
In my district, the DLT grant pro-
gram has been successful at linking
teachers in one area to students in an-
other. Last year, almost half of the
funds from the DLT program were used
to combat opioid and substance abuse.
The ongoing opioid crisis is still
wreaking havoc on communities across
America, and this is not the time to
cut corners on programs that address
this problem. We must support efforts
to help people seeking treatment for
and prevention of opioid use.
My amendment, which is fully offset,
will increase funding for the DLT pro-
gram by $25 million so that more com-
munities have access to healthcare,
education, government services, and
business opportunities. Without
broadband access, entire communities
are being left behind.
Madam Chair, I am thankful this
issue has remained a bipartisan pri-
ority, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this amendment.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam
Chair, I ask unanimous consent to
claim the time in opposition, although
I do not oppose the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection
to the request of the gentleman from
Georgia?
There was no objection.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam
Chair, I rise in support of this amend-
ment.
The Distance Learning and Telemedi-
cine program offers grants to rural
areas to provide access to education, to
training, and to healthcare. These re-
sources are critical in providing fund-
ing to acquire audio, video, and other
advanced technology equipment to ex-
tend educational and medical services,
including those seeking opioid treat-
ment.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment.
Madam Chair, I yield such time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
Nebraska (Mr. FORTENBERRY).
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Chair, I
thank Chairman BISHOP for yielding
the time and for his eloquent remarks.
I just want to rise, even though we
are under the guise of opposition, to
actually thank the gentleman for offer-
ing this amendment. We have had sub-
stantive, thoughtful, lengthy discus-
sions about broadband and its impor-
tance to rural revitalization, as the
gentleman well put, and it is more
than just wires laid. It is about cre-
ating an ecosystem of livability.
In his words, the gentleman touched
on those very points. I think the gen-
tleman would be proud to see the un-
derlying work here in that regard, but
he has made it better.
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam
Chair, the amendment would bring the
total funding for the program to $75
million in our bill. This program pro-
vides grants to encourage and improve
telemedicine and distance learning
services in rural areas through tele-
communications and other tech-
nologies, and I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment. I thank the
gentleman for offering it. It enhances
the bill.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. PENCE. Madam Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Indiana
(Mr. BAIRD), my esteemed colleague.
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Chair, I rise
today in support of my esteemed col-
league’s amendment to increase the
funding for the Distance Learning and
Telemedicine grant program at the
USDA.
In Indiana, many of our rural areas
do not have access to adequate
broadband coverage, putting them at a
disadvantage in our global economy. In
Indiana, many of our rural areas do not
have the access that is necessary to be
current.

Broadband is important to education
and healthcare, as well as economic de-
velopment and agriculture. By respon-
sibly increasing the funding for this
program, we are providing educational
opportunities and improved healthcare
without any additional cost to the tax-
payer.
We must equip our students with our
21st century tools to further their edu-
cation and ensure that all of our citi-
zens have access to quality healthcare,
regardless of their ZIP Code. I urge my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to
support this amendment on behalf of
rural communities across the Nation.

woman from Virginia.
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Chair, I rise in support of my
amendment to H.R. 3055.
Across the country, insufficient rural
broadband access is creating a divide
between those who are connected and
those who are not. That is why my
amendment increases funding for the
USDA’s ReConnect Program by $55
million, representing a 10 percent in-
crease over last year’s funding.
According to the FCC’s 2019
Broadband Deployment Report, one in
four rural Virginians lacks access to
high-speed internet. This digital divide
can lead to consequences that impact
educational and economic opportuni-
ties across our rural communities. This
figure is even more stark when you
hear from those affected.
Earlier this year, I sent out a survey
to learn more about how the lack of re-
liable broadband internet is directly
impacting the people I serve here in
the House of Representatives. I re-
ceived more than 100 responses in a
short amount of time from families,
students, and business owners across
our district. Take, for example:
Regina from Louisa, who says that
the lack of consistent, reliable internet
services hinders everything her family
does, from receiving reliable emer-
gency notifications to paying their
bills in a timely fashion;
Jasmine from Spotsylvania takes on-
line classes at home, but the lack of ac-
cess to broadband internet has barred
her from accessing assignments that
she needs to complete in order to ob-
tain her degree; and
Robyn from Amelia County, who
works on her family’s beef and cattle
farm, says: ‘‘When the internet is
down, I can’t do simple things like
process payments, send liability pay-
ments, or check the radar for our guys
out in the fields.’’
For every Regina, Jasmine, and
Robyn, there are hundreds of thousands
of Americans with similar stories. To
level the playing field for our rural
residents, we need to make sure
broadband internet is a component of
our national conversation about infra-
structure. That is why I believe we
need to expand existing programs such
as USDA’s ReConnect Program.
This program allows communities to
apply for Federal funding to strengthen
and expand their regional broadband
infrastructure, but the current scope of
these programs is insufficient to meet
the scale of the challenge and the de-
mand. In the first round of ReConnect
Program grant applications this year,
USDA saw a nearly 3-to-1 ratio in ap-
plication funding requested versus the
actual amount of funding available.
My amendment would increase the
funding for the USDA ReConnect Pro-
gram from $550 to $605 million, and I
am proud to lead this bipartisan effort
to provide greater connectivity to
rural America.
This extra $55 million is not the
magic solution, but it demonstrates
that one of our priorities here in Con-
gress is to keep our rural communities
strong; and when rural America is
strong, it makes our country as a
whole even stronger.
By helping our rural neighbors close
the broadband gap, we are allowing the
rural communities to attract new busi-
nesses, spur economic growth, and give
their kids an equal opportunity to suc-
ceed in a global, hyperconnected econ-
omy.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. BISHOP).
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam
Chair, I rise in strong support of this
amendment.
There is wide support and recogni-
tion as to the need for investing in
broadband infrastructure. As a neces-
sity for modern life, we must continue
our efforts to bridge the broadband di-
vide to ensure that as many rural
Americans as possible receive fast and
reliable broadband service and the mul-
titude of benefits that are associated
with it.
Madam Chair, the gentlewoman’s
amendment, if adopted, would bring
broadband funding to the highest level
since 2009, with the Recovery Act. I
urge my colleagues to support this
amendment. It will certainly enhance
this bill.
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Chair, I

District. We have the best farmers in
the world, but right now they are fac-
ing real challenges to their businesses
and their way of life caused by long-
term patterns in weather variation,
leading to worse seasonal extremes.
The science is clear: Extreme weath-
er has links to human-induced climate
change.
Climate change has broad impacts on
virtually all aspects of the agriculture
industry. Ignoring the link between cli-
mate change and extreme weather is a
direct threat to our national security,
to food security, and to the livelihoods
of farmers in northern Illinois and
throughout America.
This year, catastrophic flooding and
rain in Illinois have prevented many
farmers from planting their crops. As
of this week, only 88 percent of farmers
in Illinois were able to plant their
corn, compared with a 4-year average
of 100 percent between 2014 and 2018.
Meanwhile, only 70 percent of soybeans
are planted, compared to a 4-year aver-
age of 95 percent.
Nationwide, farmers are expected to
harvest the smallest corn crop in 4
years, according to the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture. And I have spoken
to farmers who are concerned that an
early frost could threaten entire farm
operations this year because of late
planting and more unpredictable
weather patterns.
This is an immediate threat. We are
already suffering the consequences, and
it will only get worse with time.
The very existence of multigenera-
tional farms and an entire way of life
for some families in our community
are at risk. And once these farms are
gone, they aren’t coming back.
Make no mistake. Due to drought, se-
vere storms, an early spring, and flood-
ing, our farmers are on the front line
when it comes to climate change.
Unfortunately, over the past 2 years,
references to climate change, long-
term weather variation, and the effect
of human activity on our climate has
been scrubbed from many Federal
websites and publications.
Farmers are veterinarians, entre-
preneurs, accountants, meteorologists,
and scientists—all in one day. By delet-
ing information and references to cli-
mate change in official communica-
tion, we hamstring their ability to rely
on accurate and precise information to
make important business decisions and
adapt their farming practices to face
future challenges.
Information on climate change and
its impact on agriculture is also valu-
able to researchers and innovators
working on technology to support
farming communities throughout the
country and to policymakers as we
work to make informed choices that
address these issues.
We have the capacity and a responsi-
bility to address the challenges of cli-
mate change head-on as a country.
American farmers are some of the most
hardworking, resilient, and optimistic
people in the country. Their hard work
nourishes our families and literally
feeds the world.
We can and must ensure that they
are equipped to be successful, because
their success not only affects our com-
munity’s economy, but a secure food
supply depends on it. This amendment
will ensure that USDA and other Fed-
eral agencies will continue to make
important information available to
farmers at a time when they need it
most.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
on both sides of the aisle to support my
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Chair, I
rise in opposition to the gentlewoman’s
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Nebraska is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Chair,
trying to control what words USDA of-
ficials use to describe changing weath-
er conditions should not really be our
focus.
For one, this amendment is a solu-
tion in search of a problem. USDA has
plenty of materials on their website or
elsewhere with the term ‘‘climate
change’’ embedded in them. If the
USDA were going to completely wipe
away this terminology for political
purposes, which was implied, they
would have done so over the past 21⁄2
years.
Secondly, the amendment attempts
to politicize an issue that does not
need further politicization. For exam-
ple, Chairman BISHOP and I were able
to have a civil discussion on changing
climate in a subcommittee hearing this
year without dragging controversy into
it. In addition to outside witnesses,
USDA actually sent up a subject mat-
ter expert on the very topic. We had a
hearing where we talked about how to
deal with changing weather and how
our farmers and ranchers could adjust
to such changes.
Instead of spending time on this type
of messaging, let’s spend our time on
actually helping our farmers and
ranchers and building a more secure
and sustainable energy future that ben-
efits all of America.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to oppose this amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Chair, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. BISHOP).
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam
Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for
yielding.
Madam Chair, I rise in support of this
amendment. As I have said before, Con-
gress’ oversight role is one of the most
important functions. That function ex-
tends to preserving the integrity of
science.
The academics, economists, and re-
searchers at USDA produce top-notch
scientific reports characterizing the
state of the farm economy, the agricul-
tural industry at large, and analyzing
future impacts. It is clear that one of
the most important stressors on agri-
culture today and in the coming years
will be the effects of climate change.
We cannot prevent the effects of cli-
mate change by simply removing any
reference to it in the Department’s sci-
entific publications. We must allow the
science community to do its work, free
from political influence.
Madam Chair, I have no objection to
the proposed amendment, and I urge its
adoption.
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Chair, I
yield back the balance of my time.

stands that the amendment No. 121 will

Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam
Chair, I rise as the designee of Chair-
woman LOWEY, and I move to strike
the last word.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Georgia is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam
Chair, I yield to my colleague from
Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR).
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.
BISHOP), a superb chair of the Agri-
culture, Rural Development, Food and
Drug Administration, and Related
Agencies Subcommittee, and I rise to
discuss an issue very important to
America’s livestock and poultry farm-
ers, the Packers and Stockyards Act.
For decades, the Grain Inspection,
Packers and Stockyards Administra-
tion, familiarly known as GIPSA, was
a stand-alone agency within the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.
Until recently, GIPSA was a parallel
agency to the Agricultural Marketing
Service itself. But under Secretary
Sonny Perdue’s reorganization of the
Department of Agriculture and consoli-
dation plan, GIPSA was moved deep
within the Agricultural Marketing
Service—some fear, buried.
Now, the Packers and Stockyards Di-
vision of the Fair Trade Practices
Branch within the Agricultural Mar-
keting Service administers the Packers
and Stockyards Act.
Do you see the layers?
This consolidation will increase dif-
ficulty for farmers who seek relief from
unfair and abusive practices common—
unfortunately—in the livestock and
poultry sectors.
The administration recently an-
nounced a rulemaking process to define
criteria the Secretary will consider to
determine violations of the Packers
and Stockyards Act on whether an
undue or unreasonable preference or
advantage occurred.
I welcome this action.

utilizing delays and stalling tactics
through this rulemaking process.
For several years, the previous ad-
ministration’s rulemaking process was
blocked through appropriations riders.
Year after year, I fought those riders.
Finally, Congress reacted to the pub-
lic backlash over the riders and backed
off efforts to block the rule. This en-
abled the last administration to move
forward and to comply with the 2008
farm bill requirements. However, the
rulemaking was not complete. With the
turnover in administrations, Secretary
Perdue quickly stopped all work on
these rules and demoted the agency in
charge of the effort.
It seems a positive step that the Sec-
retary decided to advance new rules to
clarify criteria used to enforce the
undue and unreasonable preference or
advantage authorities. However, given
the administration’s previous actions, I
am quite concerned that this rule-
making will fall far short of addressing
the worst abuses that America’s live-
stock and poultry farmers experience.
There are gross examples of abusive
contracting practices, particularly in
the poultry sector. Companies greatly
disadvantage certain growers at the ex-
pense of others. The thumb of justice
surely seems obsolete. Protection
against retaliation, pay transparency,
and a right to a fair and just legal sys-
tem are essential to protect our hard-
working farmers from abuse.
Each of these concerns must be ad-
dressed in the rulemaking process. The
alarming realities of the poultry indus-
try and similar ones in the hog and
beef industries highlight the imbalance
within today’s corporate meat produc-
tion hierarchy. This must be addressed
through USDA’s planned Packers and
Stockyards Act rulemaking process.
I hope the administration will better
protect small farmers who work very
hard every day to help feed our Nation.
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam
Chair, I appreciate my colleague’s
longtime support for fair trade prac-
tices for our livestock and for our poul-
try farmers.
I have worked on this issue over the
years with the gentlewoman, and I,
too, share her concerns regarding the
GIPSA rules and the administration’s
past history in such rulemakings.
I look forward to working with my
colleague from Ohio as the administra-
tion takes steps toward complying
with the farm bill requirements from
2008.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentleman from Georgia has expired.
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam
Chair, as the designee of Chair LOWEY,
I move to strike the last word.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Georgia is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam
Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from
Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE).
Ms. MOORE. Madam Chair, I thank
the chairman for yielding.
I want to continue to work with the
gentleman and the Appropriations
Committee’s Subcommittee on Agri-
culture, Rural Development, Food and
Drug Administration, and Related
Agencies to fight the administration’s
reprehensible attempts to increase
hunger in our country, including
through USDA’s proposed and harmful
able-bodied adults without dependents
rule.
As the gentleman well knows, SNAP
is a critical antihunger program that
helps many families struggling with
food insecurity. What I find so counter-
intuitive about this rule is that the
most common reason for seeking SNAP
is because someone is losing a job,
which is even more critical for those
who have barriers to employment or
who are already at the margins of the
workforce.
As many experts have testified to
Congress, the labor market experience
of SNAP participants, as it is for so
many low-paid workers, is highly un-
stable, and participants tend to cycle
in and out of full-time employment.
This rule would cut food aid for be-
tween 755,000 and 821,000 individuals
from red States, blue States, and pur-
ple States, and from rural, urban, and
suburban communities, without any re-
gard to the barriers they may face or
the fact that they may live in areas or
ZIP Codes or Census tracts that lack
jobs, or that companies are moving, or
other unanticipated egresses from the
workforce.
No matter what people say, there are
still pockets of high unemployment
rates well above the national average.
This body must make crystal clear
that we support the vulnerable popu-
lation of able-bodied adults who are
being targeted here and that increasing
hunger does not increase employ-
ability. It does not create new jobs in
rural or other areas with high unem-
ployment. It doesn’t remove barriers to
employment. It just simply increases
hunger.
While there are so many good things
in this package that will help to attack
hunger and food insecurity, I am deep-
ly disappointed that we are missing the
opportunity to use Congress’ title I
power to block this rule. Let’s not go
down as the did-nothing Congress when
it comes to something so common
sense as providing food for the most
vulnerable.
I am so concerned about this rule’s
impact on truly vulnerable individuals.
Let’s not be fooled because we are call-
ing them ‘‘able-bodied.’’ These folks
have challenges that make finding
work difficult. This includes veterans,
homeless people, children who have
aged out of foster care, and college stu-
dents.
The vast majority of SNAP partici-
pants affected by this proposal live in
deep poverty, with 88 percent of house-
holds at or below 50 percent of the pov-
erty level.
Madam Chair, 1 in 10 are working, al-
though less than an average of 20 hours
a week. One study found that 75 per-
cent participate in the workforce. Of
those who do work but sometimes do
not, the majority don’t work due to
their having lost a job or they couldn’t
get enough hours. This rule would do
nothing to address those issues.
Of those who are not in the labor
force, 80 percent of them said that it
was due to health and disability. This
rule would do nothing to address those
issues.
I am also concerned about the impact
on States. Despite all the wonderful
claims of a strong economy, we con-
tinue to hear that all boats are not lift-
ed, which is why the existing flexibility
to protect people from hunger when
jobs are simply not available in some
areas is so critical.
Almost every State has used this
flexibility under the existing waiver at
some point, including some of the most
conservative States. If someone claims
to support States’ rights, that Gov-
ernors and local elected officials know
best about what is going on in their
States, especially where we know eco-
nomic conditions can vary from county
to county, city to city, even ZIP Code
to ZIP Code, then you should be op-
posed to this rule.
Punishing poor people will not help
them get jobs.
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. I yield back
the balance of my time.

designee of Chairwoman LOWEY, I move
to strike the last word.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. COURTNEY).
The gentlewoman from Minnesota is

Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I rise to
speak about the fiscal year 2020 Inte-
rior, Environment, and Related Agen-
cies appropriations bill.
I thank the chairwoman and the
ranking member of the full committee
and also my ranking member, Mr.
JOYCE, for all of his collaboration.
I want people to know that this bill
is the proud work, hard work, and col-
laboration of our subcommittee, which
held 16 hearings. We received over 6,000
requests from Members of Congress,
and we worked hard to make a bill that
reflected the priorities of the entire
House.
I also want to note that this bill
makes critical investments for the
American people and for our planet. It
does that because the subcommittee
had a recommended total of $37.3 bil-
lion in discretionary funding. That is
an increase of $1.7 billion over last
year.
We also were able to include this
year, because of hard work by the sub-
committee led by Mr. SIMPSON last
year, an additional $2.25 billion in fire
cap adjusted funds for suppression op-
erations. That is really important for
the Forest Service in order to fight
wildland fires without borrowing from
nonfire programs.
Some of the biggest increases in this
bill, however, honor our Federal and
treaty trust responsibilities to provide
for the health, safety, and education of
our Native American brothers and sis-
ters.

Mr. JOYCE and I, Mr. Chair, worked
on this in a very nonpartisan fashion
with the entire subcommittee. We can
be proud that this bill continues to
move us in the right direction in hon-
oring our treaty and trust obligations.
In fact, this bill invests over $10 bil-
lion to support and strengthen Tribal
self-determination, including $1 billion,
the highest ever recommended, for the
operation of Native American edu-
cation programs. As I said, Mr. Chair,
we did that together in the sub-
committee in a nonpartisan way.
For many other agencies in this bill,
however, the Trump administration
had devastating cuts.
The President’s request was a 31 per-
cent cut to the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency, and that cut would have
prevented the EPA from its mission to
keep our communities safe and
healthy.
In fact, under President Trump’s
watch, yesterday, the administration
rolled out what many of us call its
dirty power plan. We have evidence
from the scientific community to say
that it could contribute up to 1,400 pre-
mature deaths annually.
Democrats are fighting back on this
bill with important investments to pro-
tect the air we breathe and the water
we drink. We boost support for the
EPA’s Clean Air Markets programs by
$25.6 million, and we increase congres-
sional oversight to make sure that
there aren’t any rollbacks attempted
to put the public health at risk.
We also fund the Drinking Water
State Revolving Fund at the author-
ized level, and we target resources
needed to address drinking and waste-
water needs.
This bill also takes a huge step for-
ward in building on what was started in
the Defense bill that we voted on ear-
lier this week to address the crisis of
PFOS, which is contaminating our
water.
I am very proud that, after the Presi-
dent signed a bipartisan bill to perma-
nently reauthorize the Land and Water
Conservation Fund even though the
President zeroed it out in his budget,
we chose to invest $524 million in

I would like to conclude by talking
about climate change for a second. As
we know, the administration has cut
everywhere it can to decimate Federal
funding to do research and combat and
adapt to climate change. Our bill does
the opposite. It boosts funding for cli-
mate change research, tracking and re-
porting of greenhouse gas emissions,
and energy and water efficiency pro-
grams in the EPA. The U.S. Geological
Survey has its role to play on climate,
and we support that. It also restores
very important programs on this that
were eliminated in the Fish and Wild-
life Service.
This bill recognizes the importance
of science to understand the impacts of
climate change in our natural and cul-
tural resources, in our ecosystems, and
in human health.
It is a good bill, and I think as we go
through it, Mr. Chair, and listen to the
amendments we can make a good bill
even better.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentlewoman
from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM) and
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOYCE)
each will control 10 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Minnesota.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, the
amendments included in the en bloc
were made in order under the rule. I
support the amendment, and I urge its
adoption.
Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.
SCANLON).
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Chairman, I rise
in support of my amendment in the en
bloc.
Mr. Chairman, my district is home to
Chester, an economically distressed,
majority Black city that has struggled
for generations. As a result, major pol-
luting industries have set up shop in
Chester next to schools, hospitals,
homes, and businesses. One of these
polluters, a large municipal waste in-
cinerator, was featured on a CNN re-
port that aired just this week.
All day every day my constituents
are breathing in carcinogens released
by the incinerator like mercury, cad-
mium, and particulate matter that pre-
vent them from working, learning, and
leading healthy lives. At the same
time, the Trump administration has
failed to enforce Clean Air Act stand-
ards that could protect these citizens.
Fortunately, our Interior appropria-
tions bill ensures that Clean Air Act
enforcement is a priority, but this
amendment makes clear that the ad-
ministration cannot take these under-
served communities like Chester for
granted.
This Congress will not allow environ-
mental injustice to go unchecked. We
will fight for our constituents, and we
will take meaningful steps to address
the public health and environmental
justice crises that lack of EPA enforce-
ment has fostered.
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Chair, I rise
in opposition to the Democratic en bloc
amendment.
Mr. Chairman, this amendment in-
cludes language which would take a
major step back in unleashing our do-
mestic potential to procure critical
minerals and reduce our reliance on
foreign competitors like China and
Russia. The amendment also includes
language which would limit access to
the healthiest beverage option in our
national parks—water.
Should we limit drinking water op-
tions available to park visitors espe-
cially in parks where the temperatures
can easily reach triple digits?
The answer is no.
Finally, I offer a few observations
that I believe we should keep in mind
as we discuss ethylene oxide. Ethylene
oxide is a critical tool to ensure that
medical devices are sterile and safe for
patients. For many materials, that is
certain plastics, ethylene oxide is the
only safe option for sterilization. Other
sterilization methods—radiation and
steam heat—will degrade the materials
and cause the device to lose its integ-
rity.
We all share the goal of patient ac-
cess to safe medical devices, clean air,
and clean workspaces. I am committed
to working with my colleague and oth-
ers to encourage more sustainable and
efficient use of EO.
Mr. Chair, I oppose this en bloc
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI).
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chair, I rise
today in support of the en bloc amend-
ment which includes an amendment I
offered to increase funding for the En-
vironmental Protection Agency’s
Science Advisory Board to review the
strengthening transparency in regu-
latory science—or so-called secret
science—proposed rule and decrease
funding for the EPA Administrator’s
executive management account.
I thank Chair MCCOLLUM for her
leadership in increasing funding for the
EPA’s Science Advisory Board in the
underlying bill.
As a cornerstone of its regulatory
process, the EPA relies on peer-re-
viewed science. Unfortunately, the pro-
posed strengthening transparency in
regulatory science rule would preclude
the use of the best available science.
The rule undermines scientific integ-
rity, jeopardizes bedrock public health
and environmental standards, and en-
dangers the EPA’s ability to fulfill its
mission. It would impede, if not eradi-
cate, the agency’s work to protect
Americans from significant risks to
human health and the environment.
Not surprisingly, the EPA ignored
science when developing this proposed
rule. The EPA failed to consult with
their own Office of the Science Advi-
sor, and they limited the Science Advi-
sory Board in the scope of the board’s
review.
The proposed rule would have
chilling consequences for the EPA and
for every person who benefits from
clean air and clean water. This amend-
ment will direct the Science Advisory
Board to provide a comprehensive re-
view of the entire proposed rule before
it is finalized. We must defend science.
I, again, thank Chair MCCOLLUM and
also Representatives TONKO, SHERRILL,
and FLETCHER for their support, and I
urge the Congress to support the en
bloc amendment.
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL).
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise
to speak in support of the en bloc
amendment which contains an amend-
ment I have offered.
In order to ensure the Environmental
Protection Agency is able to effec-
tively carry out its responsibility to
protect human health and the environ-
ment for future generations, we need to
ensure emergency responders and in-
vestigators are there when we need
them.
Closing EPA’s facilities or relocating
personnel tasked with the ultimate re-
sponsibility to answer the call during
an environmental emergency or inves-
tigate the cost and whom to hold ac-
countable in the aftermath is the
wrong approach. Future generations
will be less safe, and the health of our
environment will be at increased risk.
This amendment would simply pre-
vent the EPA from closing or relo-
cating any office or facility that
houses either emergency responders or
a criminal investigation unit respon-
sible for carrying out the agency’s mis-
sion.
EPA emergency response personnel
serve in offices—some large and some
small—across this Nation. These brave
and dedicated public servants respond
to oil spills; chemical, biological, and
radiological releases; and large-scale
national emergencies. They also pro-
vide additional response assistance
when State and local first responder
capabilities have been exhausted or
need additional support.
Located in my district is the Large
Lakes Research Station on Grosse Ile,
an island in the Detroit River. This fa-
cility serves the Great Lakes region.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment.
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
Colorado (Ms. DEGETTE).
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chairman, I rise
today in support of the en bloc amend-
ment and to offer my environmental
justice amendment to H.R. 3055.
This amendment would require that
the EPA identify 100 communities
across the country that are suffering
from especially egregious violations of
environmental law and clean them up.

happens when communities experience
multiple sources of pollution and then
come up with better ways to protect
them going forward. The amendment
has one simple goal, to ensure that
every American has clean air to
breath, safe water to drink, and access
to food that is free of toxins.
While the goal may sound simple, the
harsh reality is that we as a nation
have been failing to provide these sta-
ples of life to too many communities
for far too long. When we fail to pro-
tect our environment, it is often the
poorest among us who suffer the most.
When we allow pipes to become con-
taminated or when we allow companies
to spew more toxins into the air, it is
usually lower income communities and
communities of color that get hurt the
most. This amendment is for them.
These communities include commu-
nities like Elyria Swansea and neigh-
boring Globeville which are neighbor-
hoods in the northern part of my dis-
trict.
The people in these communities ex-
perience a wide range of health prob-
lems on a daily basis, like throat irri-
tation and watery eyes, which are like-
ly linked to their constant exposure to
a long list of toxins in the air. Whether
it is hydrogen cyanide, whether it is
other kinds of waste or smog-causing
pollutants, these people suffer every
day.
Mr. Chairman, I urge the Members to
support my amendment and let these
communities be remedied.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Chairman,
apparently there is an individual who
is en route who would like to speak on
this amendment, but at this point in
time I do not have a witness right here,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Chair, I rise in sup-
port of my amendment to H.R. 3055. Ethylene
oxide—also known as ETO—is an industrial
chemical used to sterilize medical equipment
and manufacture products like anti-freeze.
We have known for decades that ETO is
dangerous, and in 2016, EPA listed it as a
known carcinogen.
Dozens of facilities around the country—in-
cluding two in my district in—use and emit
ETO into the surrounding communities. My
constituents in Waukegan and Gurnee are
rightly concerned about the local levels of
ETO and any possible health consequences.
When our neighbors in Willowbrook, Illinois
faced similar questions about ETO, the EPA’s
community engagement provided vital data to
inform residents about the public health risk
they face, and the steps they were taking to
mitigate the threat.
But the EPA has left dozens of communities
around the country, including my constituents,
in the dark. These are localities that we know
face high ETO levels, yet the EPA refuses to
hold public forums to answer our community’s
urgent questions.
Every American should have confidence in
the safety of the air that they and their families
breathe. The EPA needs to do its job and en-
gage with communities where that assurance
is under threat.
This amendment would set aside $25,000
for EPA public engagement on ethylene oxide
to communities identified in the National Air
Toxic Assessment to face dangerous emis-
sions levels of this known carcinogen. This is
a small sum, but one that would have a big ef-
fect on the families living in these commu-
nities.
I urge my colleagues to join me in support
of this amendment.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, my amendment
would limit the Administration’s ability to co-opt
important public lands for an unnecessary,
hateful, and expensive wall at our Southern
border—my home region.
This amendment would defund Section 2 of
the President’s National Emergency Declara-
tion by barring agencies from using the funds
appropriated in this bill to turn parks, wildlife
refuges, and other public lands into a milita-
rized border zone administered by agencies
lacking the expertise to take good care of
them.
Our border lands are comprised of a diverse
array of ecosystems that support over 100 dif-
ferent endangered or threatened species, per
a 2016 Fish and Wildlife Service report.
The border wall would fragment important
habitats, limiting the ability of animals to find
food, water, and potential mates across their
range.
We always need to be conscientious of the
ways that any major federal project affects our
natural world. But when the project is so hate-
ful and useless, and when it impacts such vul-
nerable ecological communities, we must do
something.
I refuse to stand by while our President
abuses his powers to remove jurisdiction over
our public lands from the agencies best able
to take care of them. They are our heritage,
not an expendable construction zone.
Trump’s border wall is unnecessary, harmful
and ineffective. Border communities remain
some of the safest cities in the country, yet
the continued militarization of our borderlands
continues hurting border communities, com-
merce, and wildlife.
The Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) is currently exempt from all local, state
and federal laws that exist to protect the envi-
ronment, wildlife, historic and archaeological
sites, Native American sacred sites, and reli-
gious practices-all of which negatively impact
the borderlands.
More walls will not affect the flow of drugs
into the country; instead we must modernize
and invest in our crumbling infrastructure and
ensure adequate staffing at our ports of entry.
I would like to thank the Chair and the com-
mittee for their work on this bill. I appreciate
the opportunity to speak on this amendment,
and I would urge all my colleagues to support
this amendment.
We must stop the false narrative of a violent
and insecure border to justify border wall con-
struction.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, my amendment
would prevent uranium from being considered
as a critical mineral under the Trump Adminis-
tration’s critical mineral strategy.
Last year, the Interior Department included
uranium on a list of critical minerals required
under Executive Order 13817.
However, uranium does not meet the defini-
tion of a ‘‘critical mineral’’ in that executive
order.
Under the order, the first criteria for a critical
mineral is that it must be a ‘‘non-fuel mineral’’
or a ‘‘mineral material.’’
Uranium is neither.
Even the Department of the Interior under-
stands that.
Earlier this month at a Natural Resources
Committee hearing on my Grand Canyon Cen-
tennial Protection Act, a senior official from the
Department testified that, ‘‘Uranium, like oil
and gas, solar, wind, geothermal, and other
energy sources, remains a vital component of
a responsible and comprehensive energy
strategy.’’
Clearly, uranium is a fuel mineral, so it fails
to meet that part of the critical mineral defini-
tion.
And a ‘‘mineral material’’ is defined by the
Minerals Act of 1947 as common varieties of
sand, stone, gravel, pumice, and other similar
items.
The Bureau of Land Management also
clearly tells people on their website that min-
eral materials are sold and not subject to the
Mining Law of 1872.
Uranium, on the other hand, is subject to
the Mining Law of 1872, and it is not a ‘‘com-
mon variety’’ of anything by any stretch of the
imagination.
So uranium fails that test as well.
We don’t even have to get into the fact that
our supply chain for uranium comes mainly
from friendly countries like Canada and Aus-
tralia, and is not at risk.
Uranium very clearly does not meet the defi-
nition of a ‘‘critical mineral’’ under the execu-
tive order.
Yet it is on the list of critical minerals pub-
lished by the Interior Department last year,
and subject to all the production enhance-
ments and incentives recommended by the
Department of Commerce in its Critical Min-
eral Strategy.
We do not need to make it any easier to
mine uranium in this country.
Already mining companies in the United
States have a sweetheart deal in the form of
the Mining Law of 1872, where they pay no
royalties and have virtually unfettered access
to public lands.
The administration has already taken un-
precedented steps that help out the uranium
industry, such as cutting Bears Ears National
Monument by 85 percent at their request.
Now the new critical mineral strategy rec-
ommends reviewing existing mineral with-
drawals with an eye towards eliminating or
shrinking them, particularly in areas where
they may be critical minerals.
Because uranium is incorrectly defined as a
critical mineral, this puts the Grand Canyon
right in the crosshairs.
The Obama administration put a 20-year
withdrawal on the sensitive lands around the
Grand Canyon so it could study the impacts of
uranium mining in the region.
We are less than half of the way into that
withdrawal, but the uranium companies are
salivating at the possibility of ending those
protections early and descending on uranium
deposits around the Grand Canyon.
My Grand Canyon Centennial Protection Act
would protect this landscape and the residents
who have called it home for centuries. Unfor-
tunately, we may never get the chance to do
this if President Trump continues to do the
bidding of the uranium mining companies.
Given the legacy of uranium mining in the
West, particularly the terrible health impacts
experienced on the Navajo Nation from aban-
doned uranium mines, we should be holding

mining companies accountable, not handing
them a blank check to more of our most spe-
cial public lands.
That’s why this amendment is so important.
It prohibits the administration from treating
uranium as a critical mineral and using the ac-
tions identified in the Commerce Department’s
Critical Mineral Strategy in order to grease the
skids for new uranium mines.
It doesn’t affect any of the other minerals on
the critical minerals list, and it doesn’t prevent
companies from staking new uranium claims
or opening new uranium mines.
It just keeps the government from giving
those companies any additional benefits be-
yond the too many that they already have.
I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.

The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-

At the end of division C (before the short

SEC. ll. None of the funds made available

of the Interior to conduct offshore oil and
gas leasing, preleasing, or related activities
in the Outer Continental Shelf Planning
Areas for the South Atlantic, the Straits of
Florida, and the areas of the Central and
Eastern Gulf of Mexico described by section

Act of 2006 (Public Law 109–432).
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentlewoman
from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ) and a Member opposed each
will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.
Chairman, I rise today to offer an
amendment to protect the coastlines of
Florida from the scourge of offshore oil
drilling.
I am proud to say that this amend-
ment, as we will see this morning from
my colleagues’ comments, has strong
bipartisan support from our colleagues
in the Florida delegation.
When it comes to the idea of turning
our beaches into a fossil fuel industrial
zone, there is no divergence between
Democrats and Republicans in Florida.
We stand united to prevent drilling off
of our cherished coasts. Florida’s fa-
mous beaches are central to our $65 bil-
lion a year tourism industry. Our ho-
tels, fishermen, and recreation indus-
tries depend on clean coastal waters,
and the still recovering Florida Bay
cannot afford an oil spill.
Every time I speak about this issue,
I make sure to mention the Deepwater
Horizon disaster. Apparently, the cur-
rent administration has already forgot-
ten what happened to us 9 years ago.
At its worst, the spill leaked more than
60,000 barrels of oil a day. Eighty-seven
days went by while crude gushed into
the ocean nearly unchecked. By its
end, millions of barrels of crude oil
were released into the Gulf of Mexico.
This devastated the entire Gulf eco-
system. Thousands of protected species
were harmed by oil slicks and dead
zones. Coral reefs between Alabama
and Florida were decimated and suffo-
cated by oil, and hydrocarbons were
found on hundreds of miles of beaches
around the Gulf.
This environmental impact also left
a human toll. The accident caused the
deaths of 11 rig workers. The spill left
12,000 people unemployed and deci-
mated local economies which rely on
fishing and marine recreation.

Now is not the time to expand more
areas to fossil fuel extraction. We must
be doing everything possible to transi-
tion to a clean energy economy.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Florida (Mr. CRIST),
my friend and the former Governor of
our great State.
Mr. CRIST. Mr. Chairman, I want to
thank my colleague from Florida, Rep-
resentative DEBBIE WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ, for her leadership on this im-
portant issue and for working with me
and the Florida delegation to include
banning drilling in the Eastern Gulf of
Mexico in this amendment.
I represent most of Pinellas County,
Florida, on the Gulf Coast. My district
is surrounded by water on three sides.
It is virtually a peninsula. As you can
imagine, this issue is deeply important
to me, my constituents, and all Florid-
ians.
I was Governor of Florida when the
Deepwater Horizon exploded in 2010. I
saw the tar balls wash up along Florida
beaches. I saw the harm done to Flor-
ida’s economy and our way of life. I
have seen firsthand the consequences
of offshore oil drilling. I hope to never
see it again.
We must protect the eastern Gulf of
Mexico and the environmental, eco-
nomic, and national security benefits
it provides to the region and to the
United States of America. I could not
be more proud that the Florida delega-
tion stands united to do exactly that.
I urge passage of this amendment and
the underlying legislation.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.
Chairman, if I might inquire how much
time I have remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Florida has 2 minutes remaining.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.
Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from southwest Florida (Mr.
ROONEY), who represents the great
counties of Collier and Lee.
Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chair, I
thank my colleague from the east
coast of Florida, Congresswoman
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, for her coura-
geous leadership on this issue and join
and echo what the Governor said as we
continue to work together to fight the
scourge of offshore drilling.
Offshore drilling anywhere near Flor-
ida represents an existential threat to
our tourist and recreation economy
that we cannot risk taking.
We also have the important military
bases all along the Gulf Coast that the
Governor referred to that are equally
important that use the Gulf as offshore
testing grounds. This is the only place
in the world where our United States
Navy and Air Force can conduct these
tests.
I want to thank Congresswoman
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ for her leadership
and to urge adoption of this amend-
ment and protect Florida. Twenty-one
million people are being protected by
Congresswoman WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.
Chair, before I yield the remaining
time to Mr. RUTHERFORD from Jack-
sonville, I include in the RECORD this
letter from the Florida delegation op-
posing offshore oil drilling that was
sent to Secretary Bernhardt.
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,
Washington, DC, February 28, 2019.
Re Protect Florida’s Coasts from Oil and Gas
Drilling.
DAVID BERNHARDT,
Acting Secretary, U.S. Department of the Inte-
rior, Washington, DC.
DEAR ACTING INTERIOR SECRETARY BERN-
HARDT: We write to urge you to protect the
coasts of Florida from oil and gas develop-
ment. As you know, last year, former Inte-
rior Secretary Zinke announced that Florida
would be exempt from any offshore drilling
plans. However, we remain concerned that no
formal action has been taken to prohibit
drilling off Florida’s coasts. Florida’s nat-
ural resources and economy, as well as the
military mission as expressed by the Depart-
ment of Defense, cannot bear the risk and
devastating impacts of offshore drilling. We
urge you to take formal action to exempt
drilling off Florida’s coast from the five year
plan for oil and gas lease sales.
Florida’s economic well-being is dependent
upon our state’s fragile and treasured coasts.
Clean coasts and healthy oceans are the fun-
damental underpinning of jobs and revenue
in our communities. Florida’s coastal com-
munities thrive in concert with a healthy
marine environment. Views littered with
drilling platforms, industrialization of coast-
line and oil on our beaches spell disaster for
Florida’s economy and our neighbors who
rely on tourism, fishing and related business.
We saw, firsthand, the destruction offshore
drilling can have on ocean health, coastlines,
and tourism in 2010 during the Deepwater
Horizon disaster. Tourism dropped across the
state, including areas that were unaffected
by the rig explosion. Even without a blow-
out, offshore oil rigs dump tons of drilling
muds, fluids, and metal cuttings—including
toxic metals and carcinogens—into the
ocean, and pose a threat to human health,
marine ecosystems, and wildlife.
While there are ample environmental and
economic reasons to prohibit drilling off
Florida’s coasts, our national security and
military readiness also require keeping the
rigs away from Florida. The eastern Gulf of
Mexico is a critical training area for our
military and the Department of Defense has

stated clearly that the area is an ‘‘irreplace-
able national asset’’ for combat force readi-
ness. Any oil and gas development would be
an obstacle to military preparedness and na-
tional security.
Finally, the people of Florida are also
clearly opposed to oil and gas development
off our coast. A constitutional amendment
on Florida’s November 2018 ballot to ban off-
shore drilling in state waters passed over-
whelmingly. Here is objective proof that Flo-
ridians recognize that the state’s economy
depends on a pristine environment, and that
offshore drilling threatens Florida’s future.
Florida relies on coastlines unencumbered
by oil and gas drilling to sustain its econ-
omy, preserve its natural resources, and pro-
tect our nation’s military. We urge you to
exempt Florida’s coasts from any offshore
drilling plans. We must preserve and protect
Florida’s future.

Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.
Chair, I yield the balance of my time to
the gentleman from Jacksonville, Flor-
ida (Mr. RUTHERFORD).
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Chair, I
thank my colleague from south Florida
for, as was mentioned earlier, having
the courage to stand up for our State
and protect it from the scourge of drill-
ing.
I have to tell you, just last Novem-
ber, Mr. Chair, 69 percent of Florida
voters supported banning drilling in
the State waters off of Florida’s coast.
It is no secret that our Florida
beaches and our oceans drive our econ-
omy. Drilling could affect not only our
beautiful beaches and thriving tourism
but, also, our national security.
I have met with Department of De-
fense officials multiple times, and they
have continued to share serious con-
cerns about how offshore drilling ac-
tivities could impact their operations.
The eastern Gulf is a vital training
ground for our military, and on Flor-
ida’s Atlantic Coast that I share with
my colleague, we are home to Mayport,
NAS Jax, and Kings Bay, just to name
a few.
Mr. Chair, this important amend-
ment will protect our coast, our econo-
mies, and our national defense. For all
these reasons, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I rise in oppo-
sition to this amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Arizona is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I rise in oppo-
sition to this because I want to remind
everybody this is continental offshore;
this is not State-owned property. This
is the property of the American public.
So, if we are going to extend that as-
pect, I want the same type of applica-
tion to lands out in western Arizona
and the Western United States. So we
have to start looking at this.
We have seen opposition, basically,
state that they can’t coexist: funda-
mental energy development, explo-
ration, and tourism. But we see that
very vibrantly in the Gulf State of
Louisiana. We see one of the most vi-
brant fishing areas. The argument
doesn’t hold muster in that regard.
In regards to that, we need to explore
and find out exactly what kind of re-
sources are actually there. It makes a
big difference in regards to energy
independence because those who spend
money for tourism have to have a job,
and plentiful energy at affordable
prices help American businesses and
the American worker.
So the same aspects we are trying to
extend here for Florida should be ex-
tended all the way across the board.
But, once again, this is the public’s
property. It needs to be well invested,
and the government has the due dili-
gence in which to do that.
We can take into consideration the
concerns of the military. We do it time
and time again in southwestern Ari-
zona. We have the Goldwater Range,
the Yuma Proving Ground, yet we still
coexist with the natural resources and
environmental protections.
I think, within that aspect, I rise in
opposition, and I would ask everybody
to defeat this amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Florida (Ms.
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I demand a
recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentlewoman from Florida will be
postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 129 OFFERED BY MR. YOUNG
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 129 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division C (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll. None of the funds made available
in this Act may be used to implement or en-
force the regulation issued on March 21, 2011
at 40 CFR part 60 subparts CCCC and DDDD
with respect to ‘‘small, remote incinerators’’
in the State of Alaska.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Alaska.
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Chair, I yield myself
such time as I may consume.
(Mr. YOUNG asked and was given
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Chair, in 2013, the
EPA issued new standards on air pol-
lutant emissions for commercial and
industrial solid waste incineration,
which include the small, remote incin-
erators used in remote Alaska.
My amendment would prohibit the
EPA from enforcing these rules on
small, remote incinerators in Alaska.
My amendment would not affect any-
one but Alaskans.
I know this Chamber has shown great
interest in my State recently, but I
sincerely hope you would agree that
enforcing these rules in remote loca-
tions that are not even connected with
the highway system is unjustified.
While I appreciate the focus on clean
air, these standards are unattainable
for rural Alaska. If the 2013 criteria are
enforced in my State, residents and in-
dustry alike would be forced to be non-
compliant or would not be able to use
waste incinerators at all.
In many locations, there are very
limited options for the handling and
disposal of waste. The ground is frozen
or the water table is too high. The lo-
cations that would be impacted by this
rule are hundreds of miles away from
waste facilities in Anchorage, Juneau,
and Fairbanks.
While garbage trucks are critical to
the infrastructure of the lower 48,
transporting waste from these remote
sites would generate more emissions
than burning near the sites.
When EPA wrote this rule, they used
bad science and statistical methods to
select the new standards. They didn’t
use enough samples to have statistical
confidence in the values, and two of the
incinerator units they used in the
emission data do not even qualify as
‘‘small’’ or ‘‘remote’’ areas. They were
both located within 20 miles of a re-
gional landfill.
Incineration is the cleanest, most en-
vironmentally sustainable way to deal
with waste in small villages. One thou-
sand pounds of waste can be reduced to
50 pounds of ash that can be safely
transported.
Keep this in mind: We have a lot of
small villages that can only have in-
cinerators; they cannot have landfills
without shipping it. I am talking about
400 or 500 people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4953
June 20, 2019
This is not a good idea. It is the
wrong thing to do.
I will say again, Alaska is a little
unique. We are just about half as big as
the United States, with 750,000 people.
To put this standard in place, making
these people, frankly, break the law is
wrong. This amendment would keep
them from applying that to the stand-
ards.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I rise in
opposition to this amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Minnesota is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, this
amendment would exempt certain
small incinerators in Alaska from
being regulated under the Clean Air
Act.
My good friend knows that this
amendment is fundamentally different
from what was done in the 2019 bill.
That language barred incinerator rules
adopted in 2011 from being enforced but
left in place the pre-2011 rules gov-
erning those facilities.
This amendment would bar enforce-
ment of any Clean Air Act rule, and,
for me, that is unacceptable.
These incinerators, as the gentleman
pointed out, are currently burning, but
what they are releasing is some of the
most noxious air emissions in the
country, some of the most grievous.
It is critical that we ensure that we
are complying with clean air regula-
tions. There have to be some rules to
this.
We have an obligation to protect the
health and safety of all Americans, and
exempting incinerators in the way that
this language is currently written, for
even small and remote ones, from the
Clean Air Act regulations is just some-
thing I can’t accept at this time.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Chairman, I appre-
ciate the gentlewoman’s comments,
but, again, what do you do with a town
that has 500 people and the only way to
dispose of waste is by burning it or let-
ting it go on the turf, letting it blow
around, letting it pollute the other
parts of the Earth? This is the only
sensible way to do it.
I am not talking about great big cit-
ies. I am talking about small commu-
nities that cannot have landfills. And
that does occur.
We don’t have that many in Alaska,
but where they do have these inciner-
ators, there ought to be some compli-
ance in the sense that: Okay, guys, you
are not really polluting the air. It is a
better way. There is more environ-
mental damage by not being able to
bury it, letting it run around on the
top of the surface of the Earth, than
there is burning it.
I know I just came out of Denmark.
They have one of the largest inciner-
ators in the world. It handles 2 million
people. They burn 35 tons an hour.
Now, I am saying, okay, let’s have
those kind of incinerators, but you
can’t afford it for a small village.
Mr. Chair, I know where the gentle-
woman is coming from, but you can’t
apply all rules to every place at one
time when it doesn’t work. You have to
look at the total environmental dam-
age.
I think, if you don’t burn it, you have
a lot harder problem than you do if you
do burn it, so I urge my colleagues to
support this small, innocuous amend-
ment to try to make people live a bet-
ter way than having them forced by a
government agency to a standard that
can’t be met unless they just let it run
around on the top of the ground.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, as I said,
I understand the gentleman’s concerns,
but the fact is that this is fundamen-
tally different from what we did in the
FY20 bill in working with the lead Sen-
ator from Alaska, who is the counter-
part on the Interior appropriations.
This just goes too far. So, I oppose
this as it is currently written, and I
can’t go just supporting this, because
it completely, completely eliminates
the Clean Air Act rules.
I offer the gentleman an opportunity
to go in front of the authorizing com-
mittee, and, at that point, if he wants
to talk some more and we can figure
out a way to create a win-win, I would
be happy to help him in the author-
izing committee; but I cannot support
this amendment as it stands, elimi-
nating the rules for clean air, at this
time.
I yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG).
The amendment was rejected.
The Acting CHAIR. The Chair under-
stands that amendments No. 130 and
131 will not be offered.

The text of the amendment is as fol-

At the end of division C (before the short

SEC. ll None of the funds made available

of the Interior to conduct oil and gas leasing,
preleasing, or related activities in the North
Atlantic, Mid-Atlantic, or the South Atlan-
tic Outer Continental Shelf Planning Areas.

b 1330
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I rise
today to offer an amendment to block
oil and gas drilling in the Atlantic
Ocean. My amendment is steeped in bi-
partisan tradition. For 27 years, start-
ing in 1982, Congress continuously sup-
ported an Atlantic oil and gas drilling
moratorium.
We cannot take the greatest resource
of our coastal communities and econo-
mies for granted, which is why, today,
we must act to restore the bipartisan
language that would protect the Atlan-
tic Coast from drilling.
The Trump administration’s mis-
guided effort to drill in the Atlantic is
reckless, in my opinion. Simply put,
the vitality of our coastal economies is
tied to healthy ocean ecosystems.
Healthy oceans along the East Coast
support billions in gross domestic prod-
uct and more than a million jobs
through fishing, recreation, and tour-
ism alone.
In my home State of New Jersey, the
tourism industry generates $44 billion
a year and supports over half a million
jobs. This will no longer be the case if
the beautiful beaches of the Jersey
shore are slicked with oil.
The bipartisan cosponsors of this
amendment and the communities we
represent are unwilling to accept the
tremendous risks that come with oil
and gas drilling in the Atlantic. Hun-
dreds of local governments have passed
formal resolutions opposing oil and gas
exploration and drilling in the Atlan-
tic, as have numerous local chambers
of commerce, tourism and restaurant
associations, and commercial and rec-
reational fishing associations.
More than 43,000 businesses and
500,000 commercial fishing families
have joined together to strongly oppose
offshore oil and gas exploration and
drilling.
Mr. Chair, ocean health is already
strained by too much trash, rising sea
temperatures, and acidification due to
climate change. Our oceans and our
economies can’t afford the risks of dan-
gerous oil and gas development.
More than 4 million gallons of oil
have been spilled or leaked in the Pa-
cific Ocean since 1969. Again, the un-
imaginable risk to our shores is not
worth making wealthy oil and gas com-
panies richer.
In 2010, the BP Deepwater Horizon
disaster caused a 10-year projected eco-
nomic loss of $8.7 billion in fisheries
from Texas to Florida, including 22,000
lost jobs.
There is no hiding behind State lines
from oil spills. The only way to protect
ourselves is a full Atlantic moratorium
and a commonsense return to historic
bipartisan precedent.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Chair, I rise in op-
position to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from South Carolina is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. DUNCAN. This amendment I am
speaking in opposition to is actually
shortsighted.
We have been producing oil and gas
offshore all over the country on the
Outer Continental Shelf for a very long
time. We can do it safely.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4954 June 20, 2019
I believe the ones who don’t want to
see the areas mentioned in this amend-
ment opened up for offshore leasing
really just don’t want fossil fuel devel-
opment.
We are in an energy renaissance in
this country where we are finding more
oil and gas, to the point that we are
now a net exporter of oil and a net ex-
porter of gas. That means we are pro-
ducing more in this country than we
are using in this country, so we have a
surplus. We are able to help our friends
and allies around the world, in Europe,
to lessen their dependence on Russian
gas.
Shutting down the opportunity to ex-
plore on the Outer Continental Shelf in
these areas is really not wanting to
find out what is out there. What harm
does it do to look, to begin the seismic
work, to find out what may be off the
coast of the great State of South Caro-
lina?
Recently, they just found, off the
coast of Suriname and Guyana, 32 tril-
lion cubic feet of natural gas by using
21st-century, 3D seismic technology. If
we allowed the seismic work to happen
in these areas that y’all are wanting to
exclude from energy exploration, we
might find 32 trillion, 50 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas. Then the Southeast
is playing in the energy renaissance in
this country.
I think this is shortsighted. What
harm does it do to look, to allow these
areas to be opened for exploration and
then, ultimately, production to help
meet the energy needs of this Nation
and others around the world going for-
ward?
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, may I in-
quire how much time I have left.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from New Jersey has 21⁄2 minutes re-
maining.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
I appreciate the comments that the
gentleman from South Carolina made.
I don’t mean to speak for his State, but
I have to say, I was in Savannah and
then went for a couple of days over to
Saint Helena island, Hilton Head, and
some of the areas where the Gullah
people are. On another occasion, in
May, I was in Charleston, and I went to
James Island and a few other places.
I find it very hard to believe that the
people who live in those coastal areas
don’t share the same concerns that we
have in New Jersey about the impact of
an oil spill on our tourism and rec-
reational fishing industry.
Again, I am not going to speak for
the gentleman’s State because that
wouldn’t be proper.
But let me say this: When my col-
league on the other side says that we
can drill safely, I have to disagree.
When we had the BP spill 9 years ago,
there was a bipartisan commission that
was set up, and they made certain rec-
ommendations about drilling. Those
recommendations were not followed by
the Republican leadership in Congress.
The fact of the matter is that the BP
spill was in relatively shallow water,
compared to the type of drilling that is
proposed off the coast of the Atlantic.
What is happening is that, as we go fur-
ther and further off the Outer Conti-
nental Shelf, the possibility of spills
and the inability to take proper safety
precautions become even more of a
problem.
That was what the BP commission
recommended. They pointed out that
as we go deeper out, the technology
doesn’t exist to protect the coastal
areas from a spill.
So I have to take issue with the gen-
tleman. I would point out that the rec-
ommendations of the BP commission
were never met.
I ask my colleagues to stand united
by voting in favor of protecting the
health and economic vitality of the
coastal communities of all 14 States
along the Atlantic Coast and the Dis-
trict of Columbia.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Chair, I have seen,
in the Natural Resources Committee,
when I was there years ago, where fear
tactics were used, saying that whales
and other sea mammals, dolphins,
would be killed because of the seismic
work.
We had the chief biologist from
BOEM say not a single marine mam-
mal has ever been harmed in the explo-
ration and seismic work that we have
done all over the globe, off the coast of
the Falklands, in the Mediterranean,
off the coast of Africa. These fear tac-
tics of oil spills and things are just
shortsighted on meeting our energy
needs, and the gentleman from Arizona
gets that.
Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR).
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, the irony of
this aspect, to explore something that
is of the public nature of the people of
the United States, the ironic aspect is
unfathomable.
To look at seismic, we don’t even
want to do seismic. We need seismic in
regard to looking at moorings in re-
gard to big wind. That is what we have
seen over and over again, that this area
wants to have big wind.
The other part to this aspect is, how
does that work when you have to have
a Russian tanker moored outside of
your bay, which is one of the most eas-
ily spilled aspects of oil that you have
to have for heating oil and natural gas
in regard to heating your energy plat-
forms in the areas? That is just
unfathomable to me.
We do this better, and the technology
is actually coming back around.
As the Western Caucus chairman, we
went down to Houston to actually see
the technology that exists. It is pro-
found, absolutely profound what is
there.
No one is asking to go past go, col-
lect $200. What they want to do is fol-
low the rightful process in that aspect.
There is evidence like I cited in the
Gulf States. Definitely when you look
at Louisiana, it is a plethora. It is one
of the most diverse aquatic ecosystems
around.
There is a way to have this and look-
ing at it and benefit everybody.
Once again, the dichotomy of trying
to separate one aspect of holdings for
the American people, and then apply it
to out West, where there is even more
defined aspects of jurisdiction, to land
aspects of public lands and public min-
erals and gas leases, is just ironic.
Mr. Chair, I remain in opposition.
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Chair, I would
urge my colleagues to defeat this
amendment because I think it is short-
sighted. There are States that want to
play in the energy matrix. They want
to play in the renaissance. They want
to, hopefully, experience a 37.5 percent
revenue-sharing back to the State.
Hopefully, they can experience the
jobs that are created in the oil and gas
industry that is an economic boom, not
only for the State coffers through tax
revenue but also with the jobs that are
created in those communities.
Mr. Chair, I would urge my col-
leagues to defeat this amendment, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAL-
LONE).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I demand a
recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from New Jersey will be
postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 133 OFFERED BY MR. BUCHANAN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 133 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division C (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll. None of the funds made available
by this Act may be used to issue a permit for
the import of a sport-hunted trophy of an
elephant or lion taken in Tanzania,
Zimbabwe, or Zambia. The limitation de-
scribed in this section shall not apply in the
case of the administration of a tax or tariff.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Florida (Mr. BUCHANAN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Florida.
Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Chair, I rise
today in support of my amendment.
For my constituents and my area, it is
very important to them.
The amendment would prohibit per-
mits for hunting and killing endan-
gered lions and elephants for trophies
in various countries in Africa—Zambia,
Zimbabwe, and Tanzania.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4955
June 20, 2019
Both the African elephant and lion
are endangered species on the verge of
extinction. We have seen lion popu-
lations decline by 50 percent in the
past decade. In Tanzania, the elephant
population declined by 60 percent be-
tween 2009 and 2014.
This amendment is critical to help
ensure these creatures do not become
extinct. President Trump has called
elephant hunting a ‘‘horror show.’’
There is no scientific evidence to
support the claim that trophy hunting
aids in helping to manage the popu-
lation of these animals. If this were the
case, we would see an increase in the
species, not a dramatic decline of the
elephant and lion populations.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Chair, I
claim time in opposition to the amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Chair, I rise
in opposition to the amendment.
Sport hunting is an important rec-
reational activity for countless Ameri-
cans and has been for centuries. Presi-
dent Teddy Roosevelt, a champion of
the conservation movement, went on
hunting expeditions around the world.
This amendment would negatively
impact the people of Zimbabwe, Zam-
bia, and Tanzania. The money gen-
erated from trophy hunts helps the
local populations by providing jobs and
funding for community services.
One of the countries listed in the
amendment is Zimbabwe. The Com-
munal Areas Management Plan for In-
digenous Resources, or CAMPFIRE,
program in Zimbabwe attempted to
create economic incentives for commu-
nities and landowners to conduct habi-
tat and ecosystem restoration. At one
point, CAMPFIRE generated more than
$20 million, of which almost 90 percent
came from trophy hunting, allowing
communities to establish management
over the habit and resources within the
range area.
Another country mentioned in the
amendment is Zambia. Zambia’s Ad-
ministrative Design for Game Manage-
ment Areas program has served as a
model for locally accruing trophy-
hunting revenue, as the program re-
ceives 67 percent of the trophy-hunting
revenue in game management areas.
Fifty-three percent of the program rev-
enue is directed toward wildlife man-
agement. The remainder goes to com-
munity development.
There is also a lack of sufficient data
on the effect of hunting species that
would lead us to support efforts like
this amendment. According to the non-
partisan Congressional Research Serv-
ice, many scientific studies on trophy
hunting’s effects on wildlife popu-
lations contain disclaimers of insuffi-
cient data to measure the effect of
hunting on a species.
Certainly, improvements can be
made in these and other countries to
further conserve species and benefit
local communities. However, this
amendment would take us in the wrong
direction. Instead, we should focus our
efforts on habitat loss and fragmenta-
tion, illegal poaching, and conflict
with humans.
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on
this amendment.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Oregon
(Mr. BLUMENAUER), my co-chair of the
Congressional Animal Protection Cau-
cus.
b 1345
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, I ap-
preciate the gentleman’s courtesy, and
I appreciate his leadership on this.
Sadly, invoking the memory of
Teddy Roosevelt is not exactly the best
symbol of conservation. He was one of
the people that slaughtered thousands
of buffalo and had trophy hunting
around the world.
What is different today is that the
scale is much greater, the populations
we want to protect are dwindling.
At one point, we thought there was
an inexhaustible supply of wild animals
to kill. Even Teddy Roosevelt ended up
supporting legislation to be able to
protect endangered species, which he
did in terms of the slaughter of wild
birds.
We have seen these populations drop
dramatically.
What trophy hunters do, they kill the
strongest, the most magnificent ani-
mals, that if they are left in the popu-
lation, would promote stronger herds
of elephants and lions.
We are working against ourselves.
For a while here, the Federal Govern-
ment took steps to limit the issuance
of these permits, which as my friend
Mr. BUCHANAN points out, even Donald
Trump says is a horror show.
Now, I have been in Tanzania re-
cently and looked at what happened on
the ground. If you talk to those people
there, their future is not slaughtering
wildlife, it is protecting it.
The photo expeditions where they
take the pictures and they don’t kill
them, that they reuse over and over
and over again, is far more valuable
and doesn’t hurt the species.
Mr. Chair, I would respectfully re-
quest that we approve the gentleman’s
amendment, that we stop this barbaric
practice, that we not undermine the
protection of these species, and do ev-
erything we can to reverse the horrific
condition they have faced over the
course of the last 20 years.
Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Chair, I yield 30
seconds to the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM), the chair-
woman of the subcommittee.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, we
should not be facilitating the hunting
of species in countries that do not have
good domestic conservation programs
and have not demonstrated established,
sound, science-based management pro-
grams.
The Interior bill recognizes the im-
portance of these iconic species and the
role they play in the ecosystem. It is
imperative to conserve these species,
especially in light of the recent UN re-
port on biodiversity that warns us that
1 million species face extinction.
This amendment supports the com-
mittee’s efforts to ensure the survival
of elephants and lions for future and
present generations. I support the
amendment.
Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Chair, I urge
adoption of my amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Chair, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Alas-
ka (Mr. YOUNG), my distinguished col-
league.
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
The misinformation you have just
heard on the floor: You are not going
to save any animals, you are going to
help kill animals.
I have been to Africa eight times. I
have tried to conserve, and I have done
so. Areas that I have been hunting, like
Namibia, the loss of the animals is be-
cause of poaching, not for the ivory,
but because of the food, because there
is no value to the animal, so they will
kill it and eat it, the local people.
You are not going to help it out, be-
cause there is no value to that animal
other than food if you don’t have tro-
phy hunting when it is worth more.
If I was to kill a buffalo over there,
all I get is the head and the hide. They
get the meat.
All you are going to do is prohibit it
being imported into the United States
and making you feel good, but it is not
going to save the animal. In fact, the
animal is going to diminish. That has
been proven regardless of what you
may read.
We are the real conservationists. It is
going to let everybody else around the
world go hunt in those areas, probably
without any safeguard or investment.
This may sound good, it may help
somebody out in their district, but it is
not going to save the animals.
I suggest, respectfully, you ought to
go and witness what is occurring over
there by those that live there and are
destroying the animals if we do not
hunt them, because there is no value.
I believe I am a great conserva-
tionist. I have probably saved more
animals than anyone in the room, be-
cause I do contribute.
You don’t. You talk.
I think it is a shameful thing to say
we are going to tell another country
what they can and cannot do. That is
what you are doing to make yourself
feel good, but you are not saving the
animals.
A conservationist is a true man that
conserves, not tries to preserve in the
natural state, because the natural
state is very cruel. It takes the weak,
it takes the strong, it takes them all.
Man is the strongest of all, and they
will take them all if it has no value
other than food.

So I urge the defeat of this amend-
ment. I wish more people would go and
look and see, because you don’t know
what you are talking about.
The Acting CHAIR. Members are re-
minded to address their remarks to the
Chair.
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Chair, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from South
Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN).
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise as
the immediate past chairman of the
Congressional Sportsman’s Caucus, the
largest bipartisan caucus in the United
States Congress, both Republicans and
Democrats, and I agree with what the
gentleman from Alaska just said.
Hunters have conserved more acres
and protected more animals all across
the globe than many in this Chamber.
I realize we are an urban Nation, that
we are having more representation
from urban areas and we have gotten
away from our days of hunting and
fishing and understanding the role that
the hunter plays in conservation, but,
as the gentleman from Alaska said, we
are going to tell other countries that
they can’t allow hunting because we
are going to shut off the ability of the
American hunter to bring certain tro-
phies back.
These folks live with 5-ton animals
that are damaging their crops, a whole
season’s worth of crops in one single
night. Elephants are dangerous.
Ultimately, if you take the hunter
out of that situation, the hunter is
paying with his hard-earned dollars,
not your tax dollars, his money.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
defeat this amendment.

Included in this en bloc amendment

duce pollution in our waterways.
The amendment also supports the
maintenance of the Great Lakes Advi-
sory Board, which helps to ensure that
transparent and credible views guide
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative in-

Finally, the en bloc amendment in-
cludes language prioritizing funding

nois (Mr. CASTEN).
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Mr. Chair,
the Great Lakes Advisory Board plays
an essential role in providing the EPA
with the technical, environmental, and
local expertise needed to carry out the
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.
This board is one of over 1,000 advi-
sory boards that operate across the
Federal Government.
This past Friday, the Trump admin-
istration put all of those boards at risk
by signing an executive order elimi-
nating one-third of Federal advisory
boards.
These boards provide technical exper-
tise on topics as diverse as animal
health, safe pesticide use, trade, and
offer useful third-party review of sci-
entific research conducted at Federal
agencies.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4957
June 20, 2019
The Trump administration order is,
in a word, arbitrary, and it presents a
clear threat to the ability of agencies
to have the best information when
making fundamental and far-reaching
decisions.
While my amendment is specific to
the Great Lakes Advisory Board, I
have offered this amendment to under-
score the importance of preserving
funding for all of these boards.
The executive order is a mistake. It
is another stunning escalation in this
administration’s war on science, and
the American people deserve better.
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Chair, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from North
Carolina (Mr. HUDSON), my distin-
guished colleague and friend.
Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentleman for yielding. I also want to
thank Chairwoman MCCOLLUM and
Ranking Member JOYCE for working
with me on this very important amend-
ment.
In North Carolina’s Eighth Congres-
sional District, we are fortunate to
have the Uwharrie National Forest.
Throughout my time in Congress, I
have heard horror stories from my con-
stituents of the danger of the public
roads within the Uwharrie National
Forest.
I have seen these roads firsthand and
can testify to the critical need of pav-
ing these roads.
My amendment works towards im-
proving and maintaining these roads
and assuring public access to this State
treasure.
One of my constituents had a heart
attack, and the ambulance couldn’t get
down the road because of the ruts and
the washouts. Thankfully, the des-
perate, resourceful paramedics got out
of the ambulance and sprinted down
the road with a stretcher.
Another one of my constituents,
their house burned to the ground be-
cause the road was so impassable, a
firetruck couldn’t get down to put out
the blaze.
These are just a few of the examples
of the severe public safety concerns
that my constituents are facing due to
the inability of the Park Service to
maintain these roads.
It is unacceptable, and it is one rea-
son why I have worked so hard to advo-
cate on behalf of Uwharrie National
Forest and advocate for more resources
for the Park Service in general.
Mr. Chair, I want to thank the Chief
of the Forest Service, Ms. Christiansen,
for her attention to this issue and for
working with me to address this public
safety crisis.
In addition, Mr. Chair, I want to,
again, thank Chairwoman MCCOLLUM
for her work to increase funding for
road construction in this legislation.
I will continue to work and stress the
urgency of this issue until my con-
stituents are safe. It is my duty as a
Congressman to get this done.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment as well as the
en bloc.
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from
Michigan (Mr. LEVIN), another Great
Lakes State.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair, I
want to thank Chairwoman MCCOLLUM
for her leadership in bringing forward a
proposal that protects and preserves
public lands, ensures access to clean
air and drinking water, and combats
climate change.
I am especially pleased to see this
bill’s $90 million investment for the
first time in Sewer Overflow Control
Grants to control and treat sewer over-
flows and to help address the water in-
frastructure crisis our country faces.
My amendment prioritizes grant
funding from Macomb County’s
Chapaton Retention Basin and other
such sewer overflow systems that help
protect the water sources our commu-
nities rely on every day. This funding
will help make urgent water quality
improvements to Lake St. Clair, to the
Great Lakes, and to freshwater bodies
all across our country.
Mr. Chair, I would also like to thank
the former distinguished Member of
this body and the current Macomb
County Public Works Commissioner,
Candice Miller, for her partnership to
make sure we protect Lake St. Clair.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from Texas
(Ms. JACKSON LEE).
b 1400
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I
want to thank the gentlewoman for her
leadership, and I want to thank the Ap-
propriations Committee, and this one
in particular, for the great work that
the committee is doing.
I have had the privilege of doing
amendments under the CJS, Agri-
culture, Interior, and let me express
my appreciation for the added $2 mil-
lion for research in Historically Black
Colleges, and particularly the oppor-
tunity for my amendment to enable
NIFA to increase funding by $2 million
to the 1890 institutions, which are 19
HBCU land grants to support edu-
cational research.
It is so very important as it relates
to food and agriculture, in particular,
to make an increase so that the 1890 in-
stitutions can again be at the forefront
of research. One of the schools in my
area, Prairie View A&M, and Texas
Southern University prepare the lead-
ers for the agriculture industry of the
future. So this legislation provides sup-
port for the many schools, such as Ala-
bama A&M, Alcorn State University,
Prairie View A&M, Fort Valley State
University, Kentucky State Univer-
sity; and, of course, they enroll 40 per-
cent of all African American students.
So I am grateful for this amendment,
and I ask my colleagues to support the
underlying bill.
Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the Chair’s En
Bloc Amendment, which includes Jackson Lee
Amendment No. 91.
I wish to thank Chairman MCGOVERN and
Ranking Member COLE of the Rules Com-
mittee for making this Jackson Lee Amend-
ment in order.
I thank Chairman BISHOP and Ranking
Member FORTENBERRY for their hard work in
bringing Division B, the Agriculture and Re-
lated Agencies portion of this omnibus appro-
priations legislative package, to the floor.
Thank you for this opportunity to briefly ex-
plain my amendment.
The Jackson Lee amendment supports the
work of the National Institute of Food and Ag-
riculture (NIFA) by making a modest increase
in funding to that office for the purpose of sup-
porting agriculture research programs at
1890s Institutions, which are land grant col-
leges at 19 Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs).
NIFA works to improve our nation’s food
production through agricultural research, eco-
nomic analysis, extension, and higher edu-
cation.
The NIFA was created at the time of the in-
dustrial revolution to ensure that the nation
would have a sufficient number of working
farms to provide a reliable supply of domesti-
cally produced food.
One of ways NIFA achieves its mission is
by providing research grants to education in-
stitutions, which include 1890s institutions cre-
ated by the Morrill Act of 1890.
Today, land-grant colleges and universities
can be found in 18 states, the District of Co-
lumbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
The list includes:
Alabama A&M University
Alcorn State University
Delaware State University
Florida A&M University
Fort Valley State University
Kentucky State University
Langston University
Lincoln University
North Carolina A&T State University
Prairie View A&M University in Texas
South Carolina State University
Southern University System
Tennessee State University
Tuskegee University
University of Arkansas Pine Bluff
University of Maryland Eastern Shore
University of the District of Columbia
University of the Virgin Islands
Virginia State University
West Virginia State University
HBCUs annually enroll 40 percent of all Afri-
can American students in 4-year colleges and
universities.
HBCUs are prominent among research insti-
tutions in fields such as:
animal sciences
sustainable agriculture and agriculture eco-
nomics
toxicology and waste management
conservation and environmental manage-
ment
business and industrial development
biomedical science
food and nutrition
plant and social sciences
international development
The demand for fresh fruits and vegetables
as well as concerns for the distance food trav-
els before they reach the tables in urban
areas has led to the rise of urban farming.
HBCU agriculture research institutions are
playing a significant role in bringing urban
farming to communities of color.

HCBU’s agricultural research programs also
assist people living in densely populated areas
to learn ways to eliminate food deserts, in-
crease public education regarding farming, de-
velop a greater appreciation for our nation’s
farmers, and provide new avenues for careers
for those graduating with agriculture degrees
seeking to inter into cutting edge agricultural
research.
The funds provided by the Jackson Lee
amendment would support research and edu-
cation into means for helping urban and sub-
urban communities maximize their green
space by turning it into productive farming re-
sources to support access to affordable foods.
The funding can also help to develop new
research efforts directed at farming techniques
for non-traditional farming space, such as
those we are now seeing being developed for
urban centers.
Adoption of the Jackson Lee Amendment
will benefit rural, suburban and urban areas by
maximizing the potential for farming activity in
areas where green space is limited, or land is
underused.
I urge support of the Jackson Lee Amend-
ment and thank Chairman BISHOP and his col-
leagues on the Agriculture Appropriations Sub-
committee for their work on this important leg-
islation.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I rise in
support of my amendment to H.R. 3055, which
would provide funding for the 400 Years of Af-
rican-American History Commission. I would
like to thank my colleagues, Representatives
JOHN LEWIS, BARBARA LEE, and RASHIDA TLAIB
for cosponsoring this amendment which would
provide an additional $500,000 to support the
work of this important commission. I would
also like to thank Chairwoman LOWEY, Chair-
woman MCCOLLUM and the Appropriations
Committee for working with me to include
funding in the underlying bill and their support
for this amendment.
The 400 Years of African American History
Commission is charged with planning pro-
grams and activities to commemorate the ar-
rival of the ‘‘twenty and odd’’ enslaved Afri-
cans who arrived at Point Comfort, Virginia
400 years ago this August and to recognize
the influence and contributions of Africans in
America in the 400 years since.
Unfortunately, that August day in 1619 was
not the last time men, women, and children ar-
rived to our country as slaves or were born
into bondage here. The history of our nation
cannot be fully understood or appreciated
without knowing and acknowledging their sto-
ries and understanding the ramifications of
slavery. We must not ever allow ourselves to
forget that this country, including our nation’s
Capitol, was built through the forced labor of
enslaved Africans and their descendents.
More than a stain on our nation’s past, rac-
ism in America did not end with emancipation
nor the end of Jim Crow. We must recognize
how it continues to impact our communities
and our nation today as we address issues of
environmental justice, voting rights, mass in-
carceration, police brutality, and inequity in
education and housing. Only then can we
begin to move forward together as a country.
In the past 400 years, African Americans
have struggled and triumphed, making impor-
tant strides and innovations in science, medi-
cine, business, politics, law, the arts, and
more. As we remember, mourn, reflect, and
study horrific parts of our nation’s history and
work to address systemic racism today, the
Commission is also intended to celebrate the
many accomplishments of African Americans.
This body has a history of funding the work
of similar commemorative commissions and I
trust that our support for the work of this com-
mission will be no different. I remember fondly
the many celebrations surrounding the 400th
anniversary of the Jamestown Settlement in
2007, just a few miles up the James River
from historic Point Comfort. As we look for-
ward to the 100th anniversary of the 19th
Amendment next year, I am grateful for the
Women’s Suffrage Centennial Commission
and the funding they have received to support
their important work. I am also grateful for this
body’s generous support of the United States
Semiquincentennial Commissioners as we
prepare to celebrate the 250th anniversary of
American independence in 2026.
It was the successes of those previous com-
memorative commissions that Senator TIM
KAINE had in mind when he initially developed
the concept for this commission and asked me
to introduce his bill in the House of Represent-
atives. Each of these commissions received
generous federal appropriations.
While we were successful in getting our bill
enacted and the commission established,
Congress has yet to appropriate any federal
funds to support the work of the 400 Years of
African American History Commission. That
changes with the Fiscal Year 2020 Interior bill,
which already included $500,000 for the com-
mission. The additional $500,000 of funding
provided in my amendment will ensure that
there are sufficient opportunities for the Amer-
ican people to gather, to study, to reflect, and
to fully appreciate the story of African Ameri-
cans, their contributions to the fabric of our
nation, and their resilience over the last 400
years.
Mr. Chair, while it is imperative that we ob-
serve this year, 2019, as the 400th year since
the arrival of the first enslaved Africans in the
English colonies with reverence, it is equally
important that we celebrate all that our com-
munities have achieved throughout those 400
years.
I hope that my colleagues will join me in
marking this occasion, as this body has so
many other anniversaries, by fully supporting
the Commission’s ongoing work. Their efforts
to preserve history and invite all Americans to
reflect and remember is essential as we con-
tinue to work towards creating a more perfect
union.
Ms. MOORE, Mr. Chair, I rise to thank the
chair and ranking member for including my
amendment to increase funding to help low-in-
come households replace lead pipes in this en
bloc amendment.
Even with the plus-ups in this bill for a num-
ber of programs within the EPA’s State and
Tribal Assistance Grant account, and I thank
the subcommittee and full committee for their
work there, the amount of resources we are
providing pales considerable in comparison to
the need to address water infrastructure
needs.
Let’s just look at this program that I am
amending today. The program is authorized at
$60 million. Even after the subcommittee pro-
vided a $5 million boost (and I thank the chair-
woman for that), it still is only funded at a third
of the authorized level.
This is a critical program because grantees
are able to provide aid to low-income home-
owners to replace lead service lines. Unfortu-
nately, those households most affected by this
problem often have the fewest resources to
replace the pipes.
Recent media reports indicate that the EPA
may be finally closer to issuing its new lead in
drinking water regulations.
And while better and stronger regulations
help, we won’t regulate our way out of the
lead poisoning crisis that is afflicting our com-
munities.
We must put our funding where our mouths
are. We must help get the lead pipes out of
the ground and help homeowners get them
out of their homes. We must ensure children
get tested and treated, if they need it. We
must ensure that homes with lead paint get re-
mediated. And all of that takes funding—there
is no substitute for that funding.
Just this past weekend, the city of Mil-
waukee had the honor of hosting the Great
Lakes Governors and Premiers, the chief ex-
ecutives of what would be the third largest
world economy if you added up the GDP of
the individual states and provinces.
At the top of their agenda was addressing
how to provide clean drinking water for the
over 105 million residents of the Great Lakes
region on both sides of the international bor-
der. According to the Governors and Premiers,
the Great Lakes region contains the highest
concentrations of lead service lines in the
United States.
I want to echo the call of the Great Lakes
Governors & Premiers for the federal govern-
ments ‘‘of both the U.S. and Canada to pro-
vide appropriate resources . . . to support the
accelerated replacement of Lead Service
Lines.’’ They also called for a comprehensive
approach that leverages ‘‘a variety of funding
sources and flexibility to match the right tool
with each project.’’
This bill moves us forward—no question.
The THUD bill that we are tackling later this
week also provides increased funding for
HUD’s housing lead control programs. But we
need to start taking much bigger steps if we
are ever going to get to the point where all
children will be safe from this scourge.
That’s the goal of this amendment. And I
thank the chairwoman for her support.
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chair, I rise to thank the
chairwoman and committee for including my
amendment to increase funding by $1 million
for an Indian Health Service program combat-
ting domestic violence in Native communities.
I know the chairwoman understands this
issue very well. Protecting women in Native
communities was a big focus on the VAWA re-
authorization that passed this chamber earlier
this year. I want to make sure we provide the
strong funding that will be needed to make
those changes reality and protect Native
women. This is one program that does that.
The Indian Health Services Domestic Vio-
lence Prevention Program is a small program
but it’s having a big impact. The DVPP was
established in 2015 as a nationally-coordi-
nated program that provides culturally appro-
priate domestic violence and sexual assault
prevention and intervention resources to
American Indian and Alaskan Native commu-
nities with a focus on trauma informed serv-
ices.
The vast majority of DVPP grants focus on
domestic and sexual violence prevention, ad-
vocacy, and coordinated community re-
sponses, with some supporting forensic

healthcare services to victims of domestic and
sexual violence.
I appreciate the effort made by the sub-
committee in the bill to add funding to bring
funding for this program back to the FY 2017
funding level. Thank you for recognizing the
need and prioritizing a response.
But I think we must do better especially
when you consider the staggering need here.
The statistics (as incomplete as they may
be) are frightening: American Indians and
Alaska Natives are 2.5 times more likely to ex-
perience violent crimes and at least 2 times
more likely to experience rape or sexual as-
sault crimes than people who are not Amer-
ican Indians or Alaska Natives. More than 4 in
5 American Indian and Alaska Native women,
or 84.3 percent, have experienced violence in
their lifetime.
There are currently some 83 tribes, tribal or-
ganizations, Urban Indian Organizations, and
IHS federal facilities that receive funds totaling
nearly $12 million from this program. These in-
clude projects in my city of Milwaukee as well
as in Alaska, Nebraska, and Oregon, among
others.
I understand the constraints that the sub-
committee faces. The needs always out-
number the resources. But this is a pressing
priority. This additional funding will hopefully
allow for more grantees serving more tribal
communities that can help begin to turn the
tide.
I know the chairwoman has been a cham-
pion for Native American communities and I
thank her for her support of my amendment.
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Chair, I rise
today in support of my amendment to the Inte-
rior Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2020. In
2013, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
(USFWS) Office of Law Enforcement estab-
lished the Wildlife Detector Dog Program as
part of a national effort to combat illegal wild-
life trafficking. Certified canines and wildlife in-
spector handlers go through a 13-week train-
ing course at the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture’s National Detector Dog Training Cen-
ter in Newman, Georgia, and they are trained
for real work environments such as mail facili-
ties, ocean containers, and air cargo ware-
houses. Since the program’s inception,
USFWS has added more wildlife detectors.
There are now six detector dogs deployed at
USFWS designated ports of entry: Dutton in
Houston, Texas; Beans in Chicago, Illinois;
Viper in Miami, Florida; Samm in San Juan,
Puerto Rico; Dock in Anchorage, Alaska; and
Lockett near my Congressional District in Los
Angeles, California.
These highly intelligent canines, paired with
highly trained handlers, are able to detect
many wildlife scents, such as elephant ivory,
sea turtle skin, dried seahorse, python skin,
and rhino horn. USFWS has reported that the
use of these dogs is far more efficient than
deploying human inspectors. For every 1,000
packages sniffed by dogs, 10 packages are
properly inspected by humans.
The Wildlife Detector Dog Program strength-
ens and expands USFWS’ inspection capabili-
ties on illegal wildlife products. With more than
18 major ports of entry across the country, I
would like to take this opportunity to urge
more attention and resources be dedicated to
the growth and expansion of this program.
My amendment will designate $200,000 of
Department of Interior appropriations for the
Wildlife Detector Dog Program, which is the
estimated cost of adding an additional K–9
unit to the program. I thank Chairwoman
MCCOLLUM for her support on this amendment
and I urge my colleagues to join us in passing
it.

AMENDMENT NO. 135 OFFERED BY MR. DUNCAN
The Acting CHAIR (Ms. JACKSON
LEE). It is now in order to consider
amendment No. 135 printed in part B of
House Report 116–119.
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division C (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. lll. None of the funds made avail-
able by this Act may be used to enforce—
(1) the final rule entitled ‘‘Carbon Pollu-
tion Emission Guidelines for Existing Sta-
tionary Sources: Electric Utility Generating
Units’’ published by the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency in the Federal Register on
October 23, 2015 (80 Fed. Reg. 64662); or
(2) the final rule entitled ‘‘Standards of
Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions
From New, Modified, and Reconstructed Sta-
tionary Sources: Electric Utility Generating
Units’’ published by the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency in the Federal Register on
October 23, 2015 (80 Fed. Reg. 64510).
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from South Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN) and
a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from South Carolina.
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Chair, I rise
today with an amendment to ensure
that no funds go to the Obama-era
Clean Power Plan.
In 2015, Obama’s Environmental Pro-
tection Agency published a final rule
for the Clean Power Plan, with the in-
tent to reduce CO2 emissions from the
existing fossil fuel power plants by 32
percent by 2030. It set specific and
stringent limits on greenhouse gas
emissions for each State based on its
electricity mix.
While this sounds well intended, it is
important that we look at the costly
and burdensome reality of the so-called
Clean Power Plan.
It would cause a slew of economic,
environmental, and legal problems.
Families and businesses would be hit
the hardest with more expensive en-
ergy and utility bills. And for what?
According to climatologist Paul
Knappenberger: ‘‘Even if we implement
the CPP to perfection, the amount of
climate change averted over the course
of this century amounts to about 0.02
centigrade. This is so small as to be
scientifically undetectable and envi-
ronmentally insignificant.’’
It is evident that the Clean Power
Plan is nothing more than a feel-good
environmental regulation promulgated
by the radical environmental left and
is based on a trajectory that is neg-
ligible, all while driving up the cost for
average American families.
Beyond the negligible effects of the
Clean Power Plan, it is legally un-
founded and may even be unconstitu-
tional. In the words of Laurence Tribe,
who testified before Congress: ‘‘EPA is
attempting an unconstitutional
trifecta: usurping the prerogatives of
the States, Congress, and the Federal
courts—all at once. Burning the Con-
stitution should not become part of our
national energy policy.’’
Because of its legal issues, more than
half the States in the country peti-
tioned the Supreme Court to pause the
Clean Power Plan implementations. A
stay was issued in 2016.
I strongly commend the Trump ad-
ministration for taking action on this
issue this week and replacing the Clean
Power Plan with the Affordable Clean
Energy rule. This move paves the way
for affordable and clean energy, and I
encourage my colleagues to support my
amendment and support continued
American energy dominance.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I rise
in strong opposition to this amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Minnesota is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Chair,
whether or not my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle want to admit it,
climate change is real. It is caused by
human activity. And it will—I should
say, it is even currently now having
devastating impacts. If we don’t take
bold action to reduce climate pollu-
tion, it is only going to get worse.
I believe we also have a moral obliga-
tion to future generations to leave this
planet better than we found it. Lim-
iting pollution from power plants is an
important part of an overall strategy
to limit carbon pollution and keep
global temperatures from rising to lev-
els that will bring unacceptable risks
from extreme weather and other cli-
mate change impacts.
Therefore, I was extremely dis-
appointed that, on Wednesday, EPA
Administrator Andrew Wheeler an-
nounced a rule that would repeal the
Clean Power Plan, replacing it with a
rule that will lead to 1,400 more deaths
each year.
Those numbers, Madam Chair, are
the EPA’s numbers. Just think of it.
The administration that is held with
the responsibility of protecting Amer-
ica’s air and water so that it is fit for
human consumption puts out a regula-
tion to limit the pollution that actu-
ally increases the amount of pollution

that we emit, causing more deaths,
more asthma attacks, more trips to the
emergency room.
Every year we continue to see com-
munities devastated by natural disas-
ters related to our changing climate.
We are spending billions of dollars each
year helping these communities re-
build in the wake of those disasters.
We need action to limit climate pol-
lution. Blocking action to limit carbon
pollution from power plants is a step
backwards at the exact same moment
we should be leaping forward towards
cleaner forms of energy.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to oppose this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Arizona
(Mr. GOSAR), one of the cosponsors of
this amendment.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chairwoman,
specifically, the CPP aimed to dra-
matically reduce carbon dioxide, CO2
emissions, from new and existing power
plants. These new regulations called
for an unrealistic 32 percent nation-
wide cut in CO2 emissions by 2030 from
2005 levels.
I have just got to tell you, we are
wrapping up scientific evidence, and we
are putting a moral cloud on it. That is
exactly the definition of what Alinsky
wanted us to start talking about and
moving processes.
These new mandates placed incred-
ible burdens on States. They would
have increased the electrical rates and
endangered overall reliability of the
grid. Due to this unprecedented over-
reach, Congress rejected these new reg-
ulations, using the Congressional Re-
view Act.
Specifically, the Senate voted on No-
vember 17, 2015, to reject these rules,
and the House followed suit on Decem-
ber 1, 2015. Unfortunately, President
Obama decided to veto both of these
pieces of legislation and continue his
war on coal.
We shouldn’t be picking winners and
losers. Climate change has been going
on for eons of time. That is why you
can actually have a fossil coming from
Green River, Wyoming, that is nowhere
close to the ocean. I vote against this.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I be-
lieve I have the right to close.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Chair, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
Arizona (Mrs. LESKO), one of the other
cosponsors of this amendment.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Chair, this
amendment prohibits funds under this
act from being used to enforce two
rules under Obama’s so-called Clean
Power Plan.
This plan was administrative over-
reach, plain and simple. It would have
mandated the shutdown of power
plants and increased energy costs for
families across the country.
The Clean Power Plan is just another
example of Obama-era regulations kill-
ing American jobs, strangling our econ-
omy, and destroying our domestic en-
ergy industry.
The proposed Clean Power Plan
would have required Arizona, my
State, to achieve a 52 percent reduction
in the CO2 emissions rate for affected
power plants and to achieve about 90
percent of that reduction by next year,
2020. That was totally unrealistic.
Arizona has Palo Verde nuclear
plant. It is the largest producing nu-
clear plant in the entire Nation. Often
Arizona produces more energy than it
consumes, and so we sell our energy
and our electricity throughout the
Southwest. So Arizona energy is Amer-
ican energy.
The regulations that strangle Ari-
zona power generating stations harm
American consumers well beyond our
borders. I applaud the Trump adminis-
tration for recognizing the harm of the
Clean Power Plan and repealing and re-
placing it with the Affordable Clean
Energy rule.
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Chair, I urge
my colleagues to support this amend-
ment.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Chair, to be
clear, many States supported the clean
energy rules of the Obama administra-
tion because they know air knows no
boundary. So one State decides it is
not going to have clean air rules, and
that drifts into the next State, affect-
ing that State’s health and quality of
life. So it was prudent for the Federal
Government to step in and set stand-
ards.
No one’s power plant was going to be
forced to be closed. They were just
being told to clean up the air. So when
it leaves one State to drift into the
next State, it is not causing asthma at-
tacks for children.
I believe we have a moral obligation
to future generations to leave this
planet better than we found it. Lim-
iting pollution for power plants is an
important part of an overall strategy
to protect us from the worst impacts of
climate change. We owe it to the next
generation. They are watching our ac-
tions.
I urge my colleagues to oppose this
amendment.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

tleman from South Carolina (Mr. DUN-
CAN).

Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chair, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division C (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll. None of the funds made available
by this Act may be used to plan, design,
study, or construct, for the purpose of har-
vesting timber by private entities or individ-
uals, a forest development road in the
Tongass National Forest.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Oregon.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chair, I
yield myself 2 minutes.
This amendment is simple. It would
restrict the subsidization of logging
roads in the Tongass wilderness.
There are currently more than 5,000
miles of road that are used for logging.
They are not accessible to the public.
These roads are subsidized simply be-
cause the timber industry in the
Tongass cannot sustain itself. It could
not exist other than the fact that we
build logging roads for them.
It is a problem on several levels.
First and foremost, there is a long-
term liability associated with them.
Currently, there is some $90 million
worth of deferred maintenance, and if
you do not adequately maintain these
logging roads, they become an environ-
mental liability.
But more fundamentally, it is under-
mining this great resource. The true
value of the Tongass that makes it
unique and the true economic driver of
the region is tourism and fishing,
which is sustainable.
Alaska has been damaged by climate
change more than any other State. The
temperature has risen twice what we
see in the rest of the country. The
Tongass is part of the effort to be able
to reduce climate change by providing
a carbon sink.
This amendment is supported by
many environmental and taxpayer ad-
vocate groups: Alaska Wilderness Ac-
tion, Earthjustice, the Sierra Club. But
because it is a profligate waste of tax
dollars, we have Taxpayers for Com-
mon Sense and Citizens Against Gov-
ernment Waste that have supported
this amendment, which has passed Con-
gress in the past on a bipartisan basis.
I urge my colleagues to look hard at
this unnecessary subsidization of the
destruction of this precious resource
making climate change worse while
undermining the values that make the
Tongass so valuable.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.

Mr. YOUNG. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLU-
MENAUER), my good friend. I am always
amazed how many people in this body
know what is better for Alaska.
Four times in this last 2 weeks some
of you have come out: I know what is
best for Alaska.
This Roadless Rule was never to be.
It was Obama’s decision, and we ap-
pealed it, and we won in court. This is
State land, a lot of it, we have access
to, and we are going to continue that.
You say about climate change, old
trees don’t consume, new trees do.
They clean the air out; old trees do
not. We are not talking about, really,
timber here, because you can’t have a
timber sale unless it is put up for sale.
We are talking about access across
Federal lands, because State land is
one side—State land and Federal land
in between.
We are asking, very frankly, just to
have access. And that is the law. Under
the ANILCA law, there was to be no
more. Obama changed it by regulation.
We are changing it again.
Now, I don’t understand where he got
this information, how he got it, what
he has seen, where he has gone.
You talked about tourism. Tourism
is great for you people in Oregon who
want to come to Alaska, but it doesn’t
support our schools. It doesn’t support
a growing society. It, frankly, supports
old growth, which has no value at all,
other than to look at for a short period
of time when it dies.
We had 32 forest fires last year, be-
cause you don’t allow roads into an
area so we can manage them, and that
is wrong.
All we are asking is to have what the
State was guaranteed by this body.
And you are taking it away from them
and saying: You don’t have access to
your lands. You don’t have a right to
build anything because you don’t have
the ability to have a road.
And I stand here as one Member who
represents the greatest State in the
Union, the largest district. I con-
stantly see people—incinerators, game,
timber, mining. Why don’t you mind
your own damn business? This is not
yours.
I am disappointed the gentleman
would do this.
You are a friend of mine. Did you
ever consult me about this? No. And
that is disrespectful.
Maybe I ought to think about some-
thing that makes you more respectful
to me.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. Members are re-
minded to address their remarks to the
Chair.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chair, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Arizona (Mr. GALLEGO).
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentleman (Mr. BLU-
MENAUER), my friend, for introducing
this amendment.
Earlier this year, I introduced a bill
to codify the Roadless Rule across the
country. For nearly two decades, the
Roadless Rule has been an important
tool for preserving pristine forests,
clean water, and wildlife. It has also
protected taxpayers from subsidizing
even more costly road building in na-
tional forests.
No roadless place is more in need of
this protection than Tongass National
Forest in Alaska. The Tongass Na-
tional Forest is home to some of the
most undisturbed, temperate, old-
growth rainforests in the world.
These 16 million acres of beautiful
landscape are also a critical carbon se-
questration tool and a resource for cli-
mate change mitigation.
Despite these facts and the opposi-
tion of many Alaska Native commu-
nities, as well as the concerns of the
Alaska tourism and sportsmen indus-
tries, the State of Alaska has proposed
to strip this forest of full Roadless pro-
tection.
Stripping Roadless Rule protections
from Tongass National Forest will
allow millions of taxpayer dollars to be
funneled into incredibly expensive
road-building projects in one of the
most remote, wild parts of our country.
This amendment does not end discus-
sion of how and where the Roadless
Rule should be applied in Alaska and
other States. It is much simpler than
that. All this amendment does is pre-
vent taxpayer dollars from being used
to subsidize more old-growth logging in
Alaska’s Tongass National Forest.
Taxpayers should not have to foot
the bill to construct environmentally
harmful roads for the logging industry
in this pristine place. This is the exact
sort of fiscally responsible amendment
my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle should support. That is why I
strongly urge my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle to join me in pro-
tecting Tongass National Forest and
American taxpayers by supporting this
amendment.
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Chair, I suggest,
when they talk about the taxpayer,
these roads that are in place now,
maintenance costs were already there.
The reason they are not being used is
because there is no timber in that area,
which have been cut already, a very
small amount of the Tongass. I am
talking about State land.
By the way, can I ask the gentleman
who just briefly spoke, or anybody:
Have you been to the Tongass?
Do any one of you want to answer
that? No. They are mimicking or
parroting what has been fed to them.
This is not the United States of the
Federal Government; it is the United
States of America. You are taking
away the right of a State of access to
their land because of this action, and
that is wrong.
I said we won it in court. You may
not know that. We will win it again,
because the law is very clear: There
was to be no more in Alaska, but
Obama did apply it.
So I am saying: Have at it. It is not
going anywhere.
I shouldn’t get excited. It is just the
idea that you are supposed to be rep-
resenting a form of government, and
you should have a right to represent
your district. That is your responsi-
bility.
Stay out of my district, because you
are not doing what is right for the
State of Alaska, and that is my job. I
say shame on you.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chair,
may I inquire as to how much time
each side has remaining.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Oregon has 11⁄2 minutes remain-
ing. The gentleman from Alaska has 45
seconds remaining.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chair, I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Chair, I yield
the balance of my time to the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR).
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Chair, 32 fires in 2015. The av-
erage over the last 10 years has been 15
to 20 fires. We ought to know better.
In Arizona, I have had to witness the
most catastrophic fires in Arizona his-
tory because of our mismanagement of
forests: The Wallow fire, the largest
fire in Arizona history; and then the
Yarnell fire, where we lost 19 fire-
fighters.
It is incredible that what we are
doing is we are trying to have jurisdic-
tion over fires. There is a reason why
we have had to subsidize that: because
we have put the industry out of busi-
ness by sue and settle.
Folks, there is a cost to these fires,
and you have to start looking at miti-
gation in that aspect. If you want cli-
mate change mitigation, the best thing
you can do is have a dynamic forest
that actually produces more oxygen
than carbon. That means medium- and
small-growth trees, not old-growth
trees. A happy medium of all is a dy-
namic forest.
So if you are preventing this—the
gentleman from Arizona ought to know
better. We are sitting on catastrophic
results in Arizona. Let’s not impugn
the trees in Alaska.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Chair,
first and foremost, my friend from
Alaska—who is my friend, and I re-
spect, and have enjoyed our give-and-
take over the years—misses the point.
What I am talking about is Federal
subsidization of logging roads.
I mentioned that there is a deferred
backlog that is expensive, that the log-
ging operations that we have do not re-
cover enough money to fully fund the
operations and the deferred mainte-
nance. I referenced the fact that we
have an opportunity to be able to focus
our attention on things that really do
make a difference.
I haven’t spent time in the Tongass;
I have spent time in Alaska. But the
principle applies in Oregon and other
States in terms of heavily subsidized
logging roads.

H4962 June 20, 2019
Logging roads don’t make forests
safer. They don’t prevent forest fires.
And as a matter of fact, when we look
at logging operations, they are often
less sustainable. In fact, logging some-
times causes forest fires and puts peo-
ple in these areas who cause fires.
Now, I would just respectfully sug-
gest that what I said about Alaska
being threatened more by climate
change than any other, I am happy to
provide my good friend from Alaska
the references in terms of verifying the
statistics and facts that I have used,
but the fact remains this is something
we shouldn’t do, we don’t need, and I
strongly urge adoption of the amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. BLU-
MENAUER).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I demand
a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Oregon will be
postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 139 OFFERED BY MR. GOSAR
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 139 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chairwoman, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division C (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll. None of the funds made available
by this Act may be used to implement, ad-
minister, or enforce the final rule entitled
‘‘Endangerment and Cause or Contribute
Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Sec-
tion 202(a) of the Clean Air Act’’ published
by the Environmental Protection Agency in
the Federal Register on December 15, 2009 (74
Fed. Reg. 66496 et seq.).
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Arizona.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, my amendment is
straightforward. It would prevent any
funds in this bill from being used to
carry out the EPA disastrous 2009
Endangerment Finding.
The EPA’s Endangerment Finding
has served as legal justification for the
Federal Government to attack Amer-
ican energy under the guise of climate
change since 2009.
The Information Quality Act pro-
vides a framework for the oversight of
the quality of information dissemi-
nated by the Federal Government. Un-
fortunately, bureaucrats in President
Obama’s EPA evaded the requirements
set forth in the Information Quality
Act by refusing to admit that the docu-
ment was a highly influential scientific
assessment.
If climate change is as dire as some
of my colleagues consistently argue,
why then did President Obama’s EPA
go to such lengths to prevent their as-
sessment from rigorous peer review?
Interesting.
In April of this year, President
Trump’s Office of Management and
Budget released a memo to ‘‘reinforce,
clarify, and interpret agency respon-
sibilities with regard to responsibil-
ities under the Information Quality
Act.’’
In April, the Competitive Enterprise
Institute petitioned the EPA to stop
using the 2009 Endangerment Finding
until it subjected itself to the high-
level scientific peer review that is le-
gally required under the Information
Quality Act.
CEI’s petition to the EPA found nu-
merous instances in which the EPA
failed to meet the Agency’s own peer
review standards for the highly sci-
entific assessments. Some of the fail-
ure of the EPA noted by CEI include
failing ‘‘to allow public, including sci-
entific and professional societies, to
nominate potential reviewers,’’ allow-
ing an EPA employee to conduct peer
review, utilizing peer reviewers who
were reviewing their own work, and re-
liance on the United Nations Climate
Change Panel reports that do not meet
Federal peer review standards.
Completely obnoxious.
Now, even the staunchest advocates
for taking aggressive action on our cli-
mate should be able to agree that the
process the EPA used to adopt the
Endangerment Finding failed to meet
the required peer review process.
Fortunately, there is an alternative.
Madam Chairwoman, I believe the best
way to improve our environment and
to ensure the economic prosperity of
this country is to rely on sound
science, not on the opinions of
unelected bureaucrats at the EPA.
If climate alarmists are so confident
that the 2009 Endangerment Finding is
sound science, then conduct proper
peer review, following the guidelines of
the Information Quality Act put forth
by OMB, that will assure the outcome.
Madam Chairwoman, this is not a
partisan issue. No matter what side of
the climate change debate you fall on,
we can all agree that the EPA has
evaded its responsibility to peer review
and developing sound science when au-
thoring its Endangerment Findings.
The process was broken, and good
process makes good policy, which
makes good politics. This body should
not fund the implementation of poli-
cies based on the 2009 Endangerment
Finding.
Madam Chair, I urge all Members on
both sides of the aisle to support my
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. McCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I
claim the time in opposition to the
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Minnesota is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Chair, we
have many fine employees at the
EPA—great employees—and I would be
hesitant to put them in the way that
sometimes the term ‘‘bureaucrat’’ is
used, because sometimes that can feel
demeaning. So, to the great scientists
in the EPA, I just want them to know
that I respect their work.
b 1430
Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposi-
tion, as I said, to this amendment,
which would prevent the EPA from im-
plementing its endangerment finding
that greenhouse gases endanger human
health and welfare.
The EPA’s endangerment finding is
simply a legal restating of something
that the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change said. Every single
scientific academy in the world—and I
want to stress that, Madam Chair. I
heard the gentleman talk about some
kind of peer review, but I am going to
go with what the national scientific
academies in the world and 97 percent
of climate scientists have been telling
us for decades. I am going to go with 97
percent of the scientists, Madam Chair.
Whether or not my colleague on the
other side of the aisle will admit it, our
climate is changing. We know it in
Minnesota, and I hear other people
from around the country talk about it.
And we do know that it is caused by
human activity.
We are already experiencing negative
impacts from climate change. The se-
verity of those impacts will only in-
crease if we don’t reduce climate pollu-
tion.
The endangerment finding does not
regulate climate pollution, but it does
say that we need to take action to ad-
dress it, and I agree.
We have a moral obligation to future
generations to leave this planet better
than we found it. Blocking the
endangerment rule won’t make that
happen for future generations.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I ask one
simple question: If Members of this
body are so confident of the 2009
endangerment findings, then high-qual-
ity peer review would result in the
same outcome, correct? What would be
the fallacy with that?
Once again, good process builds good
policy builds good politics. We fail to
do that. We want to use science when it
is convenient for us. That is the prob-
lem.
The other side calls themselves the
party of science. Then they should be
all for this peer review aspect. But, no,
we don’t want to do that because it is
not convenient.
Once again, I agree. Climates are al-
ways changing. That is why we find
fossilized fish up in western Wyoming.
Was man around during that time? No,
not at all. Were the carbon footprints

at that time very similar to what they
are today? They were higher at that
point in time.
Science has been peer-reviewed, and
that is why we have gotten to the point
that when I give you one set of cir-
cumstances, you get the same out-
come. That is what peer-reviewed
science is. This country is set upon
sound science. We ought to determine
that.
Madam Chair, I ask for everybody to
vote for this, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Once again, what I
see is delay by not going with sci-
entists around the world.
Madam Chair, 97 percent of the sci-
entists leading the way on what we
should be doing clearly state that
human activity has a direct impact on
climate change. We can’t ignore the
dangers of it.
We need urgent and bold action to
address climate change. We don’t need
to be putting our heads in the sand. We
don’t need to be delaying.
I oppose the taxpayers of this coun-
try spending more money when we al-
ready have sound science. I oppose
wasting time. So I oppose this amend-
ment, and I urge my colleagues to do
the same.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

tleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR).

The Chair recognizes the gentleman

Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. ABRAHAM).
Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam Chair, I
thank Mr. GOSAR and the Congres-
sional Western Caucus for bringing fur-
ther attention to the scourge that is
chronic wasting disease.
At the beginning of this Congress, I
introduced H.R. 837, which would re-
quire the USDA and the Department of
the Interior to collaborate with the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences to study
the predominant pathways and mecha-
nisms for the transmission of chronic
wasting disease in cervid populations.
There is a lot of CWD research out
there—some good, some not so good.
What we need is an authoritative and
comprehensive scientific consensus on
how chronic wasting disease spreads.
This study will allow us to pursue the
most effective methods to fight CWD,
but we cannot do this without the
proper resources.
I thank the committee and the sub-
committee chairs, ranking members,
and staff for increasing CWD funding
and for providing language that en-
courages greater scientific collabora-
tion within the Federal Government.
This will set us on the right path to un-
derstanding how CWD infects and how
it spreads, and it will give the founda-
tion of knowledge we need to build the
right policy.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I rise
in opposition to this amendment in
order to be able to speak on it.
The Acting Chair. The gentlewoman
from Minnesota is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I
thank both gentlemen for their con-
cern and dedication to this issue. In
the 1990s when I served in the Min-
nesota House on our environment and
agriculture committee, I first learned
of chronic wasting disease and the way
that it was frightening hunters and
people who like to consume deer meat.
We took some action when I was in
the statehouse to address this, only to
find out it is a bigger flare-up and
something that we need to address.
In my home State of Minnesota,
under the leadership of Governor Walz,
we are putting more time, more en-
ergy, and more resources into working
on this issue. That is why my col-
leagues will find that the House report
accompanying the Interior bill high-
lights the committee’s concern about
chronic wasting disease and the need to
continue to collaborate with partners
to develop early detection tools and
compounds to disrupt the transmission
of this deadly disease.
As of June 7, 2019, chronic wasting
disease has been reported in at least 24
States in the continental United States
as well as in two provinces in Canada.
Once this disease is established in an
area, the risks can remain for a long
time in the environment, and we are
finding out that ‘‘a long time’’ is a long
time.
The lack of treatment or vaccines for
this insidious disease highlights the
need for more research. As a member of
the Agriculture Committee, we have
been talking to the USDA about what
we can do about disposing of these car-
casses because this disease not only ap-
pears in the wild, it also appears in
some captive herds that are used for
consumption.
I want my colleagues to know that I
look forward to working with them on
this issue. I wanted to use this as an
opportunity to let both gentlemen
know that it is in the report language,
and we look forward to the authorizers
working more so we can do even more
to address this disease.
Madam Chair, I thank the gentlemen
once again for their amendment, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentlewoman from Minnesota.
Chronic wasting disease is 100 percent
fatal. We have similar diseases like
mad cow disease in cattle and scrapie
in sheep.
One of the things that we are very
concerned with, as the gentlewoman al-
luded to, is that we have no testing
available for hunter populations. Is it
communicable to human beings and to
other aspects of agriculture? Those are
some of the things that we really need
to address.
As the gentlewoman said, we have
now seen it in 25 States, so it is spread-
ing. Once again, being 100 percent fatal,
we have to address this because we
have whole populations that are at
stake.
We can put our ingenuity to task
here. We can solve this problem, but it
is at the forefront.
I thank the gentleman from Lou-
isiana. As a veterinarian, as a physi-
cian, he understands the dire ramifica-
tions of this. I thank the gentlewoman
for accepting this.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

This development is long overdue,

ize that development through the his-
toric tax reform legislation should not

dominance.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4964 June 20, 2019
The opening of a small part of ANWR
for oil and gas drilling will increase ac-
cess to our resources and will help de-
crease the prices of oil and gas for the
American people.
Alaska contains 192 million acres of
parks, refuges, wilderness areas, and
nature preserves, and 19.5 million acres
of this is in ANWR. Before tax reform
and the opening of ANWR, 92 percent of
the 19.5 million couldn’t legally be
touched by drilling.
The law changed to open new oppor-
tunities for responsible energy develop-
ment, and we shouldn’t backtrack.
This area was set aside to be opened in
1980 by a Democrat-controlled Congress
and is limited to 2,000 Federal acres,
just 0.0001 percent of the ANWR.
We should move forward with the de-
velopment of this region as it will cre-
ate jobs, lower prices of oil and gas,
and continue to move us forward with
American energy dominance.
I encourage my colleagues to support
this amendment and our continued en-
ergy success in the United States, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I
claim the time in opposition.
The Acting Chair. The gentlewoman
from Minnesota is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I rise
in opposition to the amendment that
would strike section 118 from the bill.
I want to begin by setting the record
straight on what section 118 of the In-
terior bill does and does not do. The op-
ponents of this amendment have char-
acterized the Interior language as pre-
venting energy leases in the Arctic Na-
tional Wildlife Refuge, ANWR. That is
an outright misstatement, Madam
Chair. Although, as I will explain, I can
understand why those who championed
the inflated revenue numbers 18
months ago might be a little worried.
On the contrary, the language says
that when the Department of the Inte-
rior offers those leases up for sale, it
simply must make sure that the sale
raises more than the $500 million that
was promised.
In 2017, the Republicans were putting
together their tax bill. The budget res-
olution directed the House Natural Re-
sources Committee and the Senate En-
ergy and Natural Resources Committee
to come up with legislation that would
raise $1 billion over 10 years.
b 1445
Since the lease, that $1 billion was
supposed to help offset the cost of a $5
trillion tax cut. In reality, I believe it
was a scam to get around a point of
order. Once the ANWR provision was
included in the tax bill, the Congres-
sional Budget Office said the provision
would raise little more than $2 billion
over 10 years, and, by law, half of those
revenues go to the Federal Treasury
and half go to the State of Alaska.
According to the CBO, which got its
information from the Interior Depart-
ment, the first resale was going to
raise $1 billion with $500 million going
to the Federal Government. Well, if
that $500 million is what the Interior
Department told CBO they could raise
from our public lands, then they should
have no problem with the language in
our bill, because that is exactly what
our language does. It tells the Interior
Department that if you decide to go
forward with the lease sale next year,
then you need to raise the $500 million
you promised the American people.
That is called accountability, and the
taxpayers have a right to expect it.
Now, since we don’t know exactly
how many acres Interior intends to
offer up for lease, and we can’t know
the exact per acre dollar amount, but if
the department leases a minimum of
400,000 acres required by law, then all it
needs to do is put out a lease sale re-
quirement to the companies to bid
$2,500 an acre for these public lands.
Apparently, the administration and
the congressional opponents are having
second thoughts about those promises
now and want a little amnesty. On May
21, the Office of Management and Budg-
et sent the Appropriations Committee
a letter making it clear that the ad-
ministration opposes section 118 lan-
guage. OMB says that the $500 million
figure was arbitrary and unrealistic.
Now, how could the administration
claim that that number was arbitrary
and unrealistic when CBO estimates
were based on the administration’s
data?
Where was OMB in December of 2017
when CBO first came out?
More importantly, where were the
congressional opponents of drilling
ANWR back then?
Why didn’t they sound a little
alarmed 18 months ago?
Why not speak up and say: ‘‘Wait a
minute, I think this number is too
high, maybe it is unrealistic’’?
Well, I suspect they thought they
would never be held responsible for the
projections that they were touting
back then, and maybe that explains
why the language in the Interior bill is
characterized as preventing lease sales.
Supporters know that the department
is required to live up to the promises
everyone made, and they may be unat-
tainable to achieve.
So let me be clear. I oppose opening
up ANWR for drilling. But now that it
is in the tax bill, we have an obligation
to make sure that the American tax-
payer is protected, and the language
currently in the Interior bill does ex-
actly that, Madam Chair. It ensures
that the public property is not given
away to the oil and gas industry for a
song.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to oppose this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Chairwoman, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Alaska (Mr. YOUNG), who is one of the
cosponsors of the amendment and the
dean of the House.
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Chairwoman, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
We passed the same opening of
ANWR 14 times in this House, includ-
ing when the Democrats controlled it,
because this was set up by Moe Udall,
Senator Jackson, Ted Stevens, and my-
self for an area that has potential great
value to this Nation and, of course, the
State of Alaska. That has been decided.
Because they said at that time and I
said at that time that if Congress was
to say we should open ANWR, drilling
can take place.
Now, as far as the figures go, one of
the things that bothers me, because
the statement says 50 percent of the
CBO score, one score, the first sale may
not make that.
But who is to say what the second
sale is going to make or the third sale?
So the total amount is for the Treas-
ury of the United States of America.
This area is not pristine. I have to
say that. I wish some people would go
up and see it. It has been developed be-
fore by defense systems. The people
there who live there, the Native people,
the Inuits, they support it. The State
of Alaska supports it. It is the right
thing to do for America.
This is a backdoor approach by cer-
tain people of the other party who
want to not open ANWR. You lost that
battle. We won. For the good of the
country, the good of the State, and for
the good of the people, we won. This is
a back way to stop it.
I believe we are going to raise that
money. That is how confident I am. I
think the sales will produce what we
say. So I am not going to really get ex-
cited about this, because it is not going
to go anywhere. Thank God we have
got two Senators for every State. It is
the right thing to do. That is why the
Constitution and the forefathers made
it that way. So I have got two Senators
who will make sure this doesn’t go
anywhere.
I appreciate those who oppose it. I
thank the chairwoman for actually
saying she does oppose opening ANWR.
I respect that. I happen to support it,
and I think I will be proven right.
I believe this amendment is the right
way to go. I think we ought to elimi-
nate the question, so I am going to
urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this legislation. It
is the right thing to do. Then let’s go
forward and really govern for the fu-
ture. That is important. We are miss-
ing that.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Arizona
(Mr. GOSAR).
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chairman, this
amendment attempts to change the re-
quirements for oil and gas leases. I will
say it’s very entrepreneurial in its dis-
guise.
But I want to remind people in re-
gard to how big this aspect is. This is
a small, little area. To give you an ex-
ample, ANWR is the size of Massachu-
setts, Rhode Island, Vermont, and New
Hampshire combined. Energy devel-
oped with ANWR is just one-fifth the
size of the Dulles Airport. Amazing. If
you have ever been there, it is some-
thing to be seen.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4965
June 20, 2019
As the Congressional Western Caucus
chairman, we actually took that lib-
erty of going up there and being hosted
by the gentleman from Alaska. What
you are being told and what is being
there in aspect isn’t the same.
So, Madam Chair, I actually join the
gentleman from South Carolina and
ask for a ‘‘yes’’ vote.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. I reserve the bal-
ance of my time, Madam Chair.
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Chair, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOYCE).
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Madam Chair, I
rise in support of this amendment.
When it comes to ANWR, there is no
such thing as a noncontroversial policy
provision. This one found its way into
the Interior-Environment spending bill
at a time when longstanding bipartisan
provisions have fallen out.
As I mentioned during general debate
on this spending package, we need to
remove these poison pill riders before
we can reach a longstanding bipartisan
agreement. That is why I support the
amendment to strike this controversial
policy position.
Madam Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on
this amendment.
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. May I inquire how
much time I have on closing, Madam
Chair.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Minnesota has 30 seconds remain-
ing.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Well, Madam Chair,
facts speak for themselves. This sale
was used to offset the tax bill, to keep
the American people confident that we
were going to have our house in order
when the tax bill passed. Well, the first
sale was supposed to guarantee $500
million, and if they get less than that
on the first sale, as the gentleman said,
how much lower does it go on the sec-
ond?
I just remind people that we need to
protect the American taxpayer on this
one and make sure that we don’t get
taken to the cleaners.
Madam Chair, I oppose this amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. DUN-
CAN).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Chair, I de-
mand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from South Carolina
will be postponed.
It is now in order to consider amend-
ment No. 144 printed in part B of House
Report 116–119.
AMENDMENT NO. 147 OFFERED BY MR. MULLIN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 147 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. MULLIN. Madam Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division C (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll. None of the funds made available
by this Act may be used to enforce the final
rule entitled ‘‘Oil and Natural Gas Sector:
Emission Standards for New, Reconstructed,
and Modified Sources’’ published by the En-
vironmental Protection Agency in the Fed-
eral Register on June 3, 2016 (81 Fed. Reg.
35824).
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Oklahoma (Mr. MULLIN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Oklahoma.
Mr. MULLIN. Madam Chair, this
amendment would prohibit funds for
enforcing the Obama administration
EPA methane rule. The rule is cur-
rently facing litigation and uncer-
tainty, and Congress must act to block
this job-killing regulation estimating
that it will cost the economy roughly
$530 million annually.
While oil and gas production has in-
creased over 25 percent since 2005, re-
lated methane gas emissions have actu-
ally decreased over 40 percent during
the same period, meaning the industry
is doing a good job of regulating them-
selves.
It is counterproductive for the Fed-
eral Government to enact harmful reg-
ulations that cause inefficiencies and
recklessly spending taxpayer dollars
enforcing hardships on true job cre-
ators.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I rise
in very strong opposition to the
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Minnesota is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Chair, this
amendment would prevent the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency from en-
forcing commonsense rules requiring
oil and gas industries to prevent nat-
ural gas leaks from their drilling oper-
ations. The rule has been in effect for 3
years now, and the oil and gas industry
is complying with those regulations.
Preventing methane leaks has an im-
portant public health benefit. Leaks
from natural gas operations are signifi-
cant sources of ozone pollution which
trigger asthma attacks and send thou-
sands of children to emergency rooms
every year.
This rule actually saves the oil and
gas industry money because natural
gas that is not wasted can be sold.
The proponents of this amendment
argue that the rule isn’t necessary be-
cause oil and gas companies have an in-
centive to prevent leaks. But the sim-
ple fact is leaks continue to happen un-
less companies are required to prevent
them. People might not like eating
their vegetables, but we are all better
off for doing it.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MULLIN. Madam Chair, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. GOSAR).
Mr. GOSAR. My colleague, Mr.
MULLIN, is absolutely correct. When
former President Obama directed the
EPA, BLM, and other agencies to tar-
get industries for greenhouse gas emis-
sions, they went directly for the oil
and natural gas first.
But this EPA rule targeting methane
is completely unnecessary. It is pro-
duced as a byproduct of oil and natural
gas production, but it is a valuable
product in itself that can be sold and is
sold. It is something that oil and gas
companies routinely capture and sell.
They were doing a great job of this
even before this rule. It was unneces-
sary.
Even EPA estimates show that the
methane emissions have decreased
while the production of natural gas and
oil have increased over the same pe-
riod. The free market has provided an
incentive to reduce methane release on
its own. There is no further need for
the EPA to impose this bureaucratic
hurdle. It is expensive. The cost is esti-
mated to cost our economy $530 million
annually. Amazing.
Once again, as Ronald Reagan used
to say:
Government is not the solution, govern-
ment is the problem.
This is a regulation in search of a
problem.
Madam Chair, I support the gentle-
man’s amendment.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. MULLIN. Madam Chair, in clos-
ing, during the conversation that was
taking place just a second ago, a com-
ment was made that said it actually
saves the industry money. I got have
got to step back and think, how is that
possible? Because if it was saving the
industry money they wouldn’t oppose
it.
If it is saving money, who would op-
pose it?
I haven’t met a regulation ever from
a small business owner—which is the
only reason why I am here, because of
the job-killing regulations that come
out of this place constantly—that has
ever saved me any money.
What we are talking about are real
jobs that affect real people’s lives.
This Congress always talks about job
creation and creating job packages. We
want to brag about how many jobs we
have created. This body doesn’t create
jobs. We are supposed to create an en-
vironment in which job creators can
create a job, and we are saying this one
will kill jobs.
So why would we support this?
It doesn’t make any sense to me.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Chair, we
know for a fact that methane leaks

contribute to ground level ozone pollu-

human beings. We do know that reduc-
ing leaks improves the bottom line for
the oil and gas companies.
So I oppose this amendment. And I
want to stand with common sense to do
everything possible to keep these leaks
from happening in the future.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

At the end of division C (before the short

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Oklahoma (Mr. MULLIN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Oklahoma.
Mr. MULLIN. Madam Chair, my
amendment would prohibit funds from
implementing the social cost of carbon
rule.
The Obama administration continu-
ously used social cost of carbon models
which can be easily manipulated in
order to attempt to justify, once again,
new job-killing regulations.
I offered this same amendment yes-
terday, and, unfortunately, it failed.
Until then, the House had a clear,
strong record of opposition to the so-
cial cost of carbon, voting at least 12
times to block, defund, or oppose the
proposal.
We want clean air; we want clean
water; and we take care of the land we
live on. Using subjective standards to
create job-killing regulations is not
the way to accomplish this goal.
The social cost of carbon rule is
nothing more than more burdensome
red tape for the American people.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Chair, I rise
in strong opposition to this amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Maine is recognized for 5 minutes.
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Chair, I am
sorry to say that I have to oppose the
amendment from the gentleman from
Oklahoma and appreciate his thoughts,
but he is completely wrong.
The amendment is a harmful rider
that would prohibit the EPA from con-
sidering the social cost of carbon as
part of rulemakings.
The ‘‘social cost of carbon’’ may
sound a little confusing to people, but,
frankly, it is an estimate of the eco-
nomic damages associated with the
small increase in carbon dioxide emis-
sions in a given year. It represents,
currently, our best scientific informa-
tion available for incorporating the im-
pacts from carbon pollution into regu-
latory analysis.
Weakening or eliminating the use of
the social cost of carbon as a tool for
Federal agencies would ignore the so-
bering cost of health, environmental
and economic impacts of extreme
weather, rising temperatures, inten-
sifying smog, and other impacts.
We just cannot afford to abandon
science at this critical moment in
time. Our country needs to face the
challenges ahead of us with climate
change and have the best scientific
tools available, and this is one.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MULLIN. Madam Chair, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. GOSAR).
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chairwoman, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Chairwoman, I rise today in
support of this commonsense amend-
ment that will protect American jobs
and the economy but prohibit funds
from being used for implementing the
Obama administration’s flawed social
cost of carbon, or SCC, valuation.
This job-killing and unlawful guid-
ance sneakily attempts to pave the
way for cap-and-trade-like mandates.
Congress and the American people have
repeatedly rejected cap-and-trade pro-
posals.
Knowing that he could not lawfully
enact a carbon tax plan, President
Obama attempted to circumvent Con-
gress by playing loose and fast with the
Clean Air Act to unilaterally imple-
ment this unlawful new requirement
under the guise of guidance.
The social cost of carbon is not based
on science, and the models can be eas-
ily manipulated to arrive at whatever
conclusion is desired.
Once again, when we look at carbon,
it is a nutrient for plants. To say oth-
erwise is disrespectful. Once again, we
play loose and fast with sound science.
So, in regards to this, the House has
decisively voted a dozen times to block
or defund and oppose the social cost of
carbon. I support the gentleman’s
amendment.
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chair, while I re-
spect the gentlewoman’s opinion—and
this is one of those things where we
agree to disagree—I do have to say one
thing.
She said the science in measuring the
social cost of carbon has proven true.
Actually, that is not true. The science
isn’t there. We actually don’t have a
good method to measure the social cost
of carbon.
That is why the whole issue is that it
can easily be manipulated to fit what-
ever model they choose, which means
that they can pick and choose what
type of energy we are able to produce
and how we produce it, meaning that
they can choose, not the consumer, to
say: We no longer want to have fossil
fuels as a choice; we only want renew-
ables.
If we are going to be an all-of-the-
above country and we are going to em-
brace industry and entrepreneurs, then
we have got to embrace all of the
above. If consumers don’t want that, if
certain States don’t want to buy fossil
fuel energy, then they can choose not
to do so.
In Oklahoma, we are all of the above.
Not only are we a leader in producing
fossil fuels, but we are also the third
largest in producing renewables. We be-
lieve all of the above.
Our neighbor in Texas, while they are
a leader in producing oil, they are the
number one in renewables.
Isn’t it ironic that both are red
States?
All we are saying here is let’s not
manipulate and allow the government

Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of

Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I do appre-
ciate my colleague from Oklahoma
clarifying that it is a big State for re-
newables and Texas is as well, and I en-
courage them to continue farther down
that path because that is certainly an
important challenge that we have to
overcome is having more renewables in
our country.
I would again say that climate
change is the greatest environmental
threat that mankind has ever faced. We
need to deploy every available tool at
our disposal and address this crisis, in-
cluding the best available science and
economics, which I believe is also rep-
resented in the social cost of carbon
analysis.
I strongly oppose the Mullin amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of

The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Missouri.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Chair,
today I rise in support of my amend-
ment which would demonstrate the en-
vironmental benefits of the U.S.-Mex-
ico-Canada Trade Agreement, as well
as show the cost of delaying passage of
this agreement.
USMCA is groundbreaking in more
ways than one. It will create thousands
of U.S. jobs, improve our economy, in-
crease U.S. agriculture exports, and re-
duce our trade deficits with Mexico.
Thanks to President Trump, this
trade agreement is also a great
achievement for the environment.
USMCA brings all environmental pro-
visions into the core of the agreement,
which means that they can be fully en-
forced.
The agreement contains the first-of-
its-kind language on improving air
quality as well as appropriate proce-
dures for environmental impact assess-
ments.
The agreement takes a commonsense
approach by creating a partnership be-
tween the U.S. and two of its most im-
portant trade allies toward a unified
goal of improving the environment.
Importantly, the agreement also
maintains each country’s sovereignty
over their own laws. This will create
more environmental benefits than any-
thing offered by my friends across the
aisle who, so far, have only come up
with eradicating U.S. agriculture,
eliminating cows, and eliminating air
travel.
My amendment would direct the EPA
to use these funds to produce reports
that would demonstrate the environ-
mental improvements that we are not
benefiting from every day this agree-
ment is not in effect. This way, the
American people can see firsthand
what the cost of delay truly is.
Just yesterday, Mexico voted over-
whelmingly to ratify this agreement.
Canada is moving forward as well. It is
time for Democrats to decide what is
worse for them: giving President
Trump a win or allowing the U.S. to re-
main in an outdated trade agreement
that is not up to the standards we hold
today.
USMCA is a great agreement for the
American people, and it is time to
vote. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on my amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of
my time.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Washington.
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I
rise to speak on my bipartisan amend-
ment to prevent any funding in this In-
terior appropriations bill from being
used to close or transfer the operation
of U.S. Forest Service Job Corps Civil-
ian Conservation Centers.
Fortunately, Mr. Chairman, after
overwhelming concern expressed by a
broad coalition of my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle and on both sides
of the Capitol, I am pleased to report
that the Secretary of Agriculture,
Sonny Perdue, has listened to our con-
cerns and informed us that the pro-
posal to end the CCC program will be
withdrawn.
Over the past several weeks, I have
helped lead this coalition to tell the
important story of our Civilian Con-
servation Centers and the value they
provide in supporting rural commu-
nities and maintaining our public
lands, actively managing our Nation’s
forests, and helping restore commu-
nities harmed by catastrophic
wildfires.
I would like to thank Secretary
Perdue for listening to the concerns of
central Washington communities and
for preserving the unique and impor-
tant role these centers play in rural
communities.
I look forward to working in partner-
ship with the CCCs; the U.S. Forest
Service; and our many local, regional,
and Federal partners in strengthening

these programs so they can continue to
efficiently and effectively support the
U.S. Forest Service motto of: Caring
for the Land and Serving People.
Mr. Chairman, I intend to withdraw
my amendment, but I will continue to
reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I claim the
time in opposition, although I do not
oppose the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentlewoman from Maine is
recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Oregon
(Mr. SCHRADER).
Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Chairman, I
would like to echo Mr. NEWHOUSE’s
comments et large.
The Job Corps Civilian Conservation
Centers are a critical aspect of rural
America’s ability to fight fires and do
good work in rural America.
I want to applaud Secretary Perdue
for reversing his decision. It is one
thing to be here in Washington, DC,
and think you are counting the tax-
payers’ money very carefully and doing
the right thing; it is another thing to
be out in the real world and live the
life that we have out there in timber
country and know what valuable les-
sons they provide these at-risk youth
who, frankly, would have no other op-
tions going forward and, at this point,
fight our devastating wildfires. They
are adjunct to the professional people
that we have out there.
I thank Representatives NEWHOUSE,
DEFAZIO, GIANFORTE, and even Senator
MERKLEY on the Senate side. This is
one area where you have nice bipar-
tisan, bicameral support, and it is an
area where it is good to see Congress
come together and the executive
branch understand the realities of the
world.
Mr. Chair, I really appreciate every-
one’s efforts. It has been fun to work
on that.
b 1515
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I rise in
support of this amendment, and I
thank my colleague from the Appro-
priations Committee for doing this.
This is an important amendment that
would prohibit any changes to the Job
Corps centers or their closure.
I appreciate that Secretary Perdue
has announced his change of heart, but
I want to make sure that the adminis-
tration doesn’t change the plan again.
I think everyone else has said it very
articulately. These are really impor-
tant operations. They teach our young
people a tremendous number of things.
They provide full-time and temporary
jobs. In New England—as on the West
Coast, I am sure—we need a lot of these
people to help us with some of the chal-
lenges that are going on today.
The Department of Labor had pre-
viously announced a proposal to close
nine of the facilities. That would have
impacted 356 full-time and 107 tem-
porary and contract employees. More
than 3,000 students were at risk of los-
ing the opportunity to develop the
skills and work experience they need to
get jobs, and that would include the 966
students at centers that have been pro-
posed for closure.
Our Nation would lose out as well.
We have already heard some of the
ways that would happen on the West
Coast, as it certainly would on the
East Coast as well. These are countless
hours for young people in conservation
work, forest restoration work, and
wildland firefighting.
To quote a USDA web page, I will say
that ‘‘there has never been a time when
Civilian Conservation Centers were
more necessary or a more worthwhile
investment in our Nation’s future.’’
Mr. Chair, I concur with the gen-
tleman, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chair, I thank
my good friend and colleague from
Maine, Ms. PINGREE, as well as my
good friend and colleague from Oregon,
Mr. SCHRADER, for their comments.
In the weeks since this proposal had
been announced to close the Forest
Service Job Corps CCCs, I know my
colleagues have, and I also have, re-
ceived dozens of personal accounts and
testimonials from men and women
across my district whose lives were
profoundly impacted for the better by
the CCC program. I will quote a couple
of those comments, Mr. Chair.
The first one: ‘‘Job Corps saved my
life.’’
‘‘The 10 months I spent at Fort
Simcoe were the most beneficial
months of my life.’’
Another person said of the program:
The CCC ‘‘didn’t just change my life
but saved my life.’’
‘‘I am so grateful for Columbia Basin
Job Corps Civilian Conservation Cen-
ter. . . . If they hadn’t accepted me, I
would be in a different, much worse
phase of my life.’’
Mr. Chair, I would, again, like to
thank the Secretary of Agriculture,
Mr. PERDUE, for hearing the strong
support expressed by my colleagues
and myself on behalf of the U.S. Forest
Service Job Corps CCC program.
Mr. Chair, I respectfully withdraw
the amendment, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The amendment
is withdrawn.
AMENDMENT NO. 158 OFFERED BY MR. GRAVES OF
LOUISIANA
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 158 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr.
Chair, I have an amendment at the
desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 285, strike line 6 and all that follows
through line 25.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Louisiana.
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr.
Chair, this amendment is pretty sim-
ple. Section 117 in division C of the
base text of the bill prevents the De-
partment of the Interior from carrying
out a NEPA review, a National Envi-
ronmental Policy Act review, for the
planning of offshore energy production.
Mr. Chair, we just heard a few
amendments back, debate about the
importance of science, the importance
of data. Let’s be clear what this provi-
sion does. This provision prevents the
Federal Government from opening up
the plan for an environmental review,
from subjecting it to public feedback.
It prevents data and information to
make informed decisions.
Mr. Chair, there is a process under
the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act
where you go do an offshore plan. It is
a pretty clear process. If folks have a
problem with that, amend the law.
Amend the law, don’t use the appro-
priations process to prevent the public
from getting access to information and
access to data so the Federal Govern-
ment can make an informed decision.
This is flawed text of the amend-
ment. Our amendment simply helps to
address it, to allow for an open, public
process so we can make the right, in-
formed decision with the right science
and the right data, as my friends were
recently speaking about.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I rise in op-
position to this amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Maine is recognized for 5 minutes.
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I rise in op-
position to this amendment, which
would strike section 117 from the bill.
I have been a strong opponent of the
current administration’s offshore drill-
ing proposals. I am proud to have the
chance to manage this time in opposi-
tion to this amendment, which would
be so devastating to States like my
home State of Maine.
I want to start by correcting a
mischaracterization that I think has
been made. The description of the gen-
tleman’s amendment states that it is
removing language from the Interior
bill ‘‘which prohibits funds’’ for the ad-
ministration’s 5-year offshore drilling
plan. That is actually not correct.
The language in the bill does not pro-
hibit the administration from working
on its plan. What the language in sec-
tion 117 does is to tell the Interior De-
partment that if it moves forward with
oil and gas activities in 2020, it must do
so only with respect to lease sales that
have been through the entire approval
and review process spelled out in the
law.
Our language recognizes the fact that
the 2017 offshore drilling plan under the
previous Presidential administration is
the only plan that has completed all
the steps required by the Outer Conti-
nental Shelf Lands Act. Because of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4969

that, we agree that the Interior De-
partment is free to continue to imple-
ment the previous 2017 narrow plan.
In the meantime, it is true that the
current administration is working on a
new oil and gas drilling plan that
would cover the 2019 to 2024 timeframe.
This new plan, if implemented, would
open up the entire East and West
Coasts to drilling.
To date, the current administration
has put out one iteration of its plan,
with two more to go. Despite not hav-
ing completed the process, the admin-
istration has acknowledged it is al-
ready conducting pre-lease work in the
mid-Atlantic, south Atlantic, and
southern California planning areas.
The budget for the Bureau of Ocean
Energy Management states that it is
preparing ‘‘four new environmental im-
pact statements for the lease sales that
are planned in early 2020 or early 2021,’’
which is where the problem comes in.
The new 5-year plan, which is noth-
ing more than a work in progress, is
under siege, both from the courts and a
complete lack of political support. In
late March, a Federal court reinstated
the moratorium in the north Atlantic
planning area. That decision has essen-
tially frozen work on the new plan.
In fact, the Secretary told me, under
questioning in an Interior Sub-
committee hearing last month, that he
did not know the outcome of the pro-
posed plan. He said a new plan wasn’t
‘‘imminent.’’ He was also quick to
point out that no previous 5-year plan
has ever included drilling in a State
that was opposed to such activity.
If that is his bottom line, then he
might as well throw in the towel right
now as there is not a single State along
the Atlantic or Pacific Coasts that is
in favor of drilling.
My home State of Maine has a $5.6
billion tourism industry, 71 percent of
which comes directly from the Maine
coast. Thirty thousand Mainers make
their living in marine industries. Our
world-famous lobster fishery alone
brings in $500 million annually.
Our Governor, our Senators, our con-
gressional delegation, and many of our
cities and towns oppose the OCS drill-
ing proposal.
As nearly one-third of the United
States population lives in the coastal
areas impacted by this proposal, and
there is broad bipartisan opposition to
this issue, moving forward makes no
sense, either fiscally or practically.
The language in our Interior bill sim-
ply supports that position. It says to
follow the law, complete all procedural
steps, including responding to the con-
cerns of the American public, the con-
cerns of their Governors, and the con-
cerns of their Members of Congress, be-
fore moving forward on individual
drilling projects.
To the Department, it says to save
its money until it completes the proc-
ess and finds out if it can drill for oil
off the coast of South Carolina or off
the coast of Florida or off the coast of
California.
Following a well-thought-out proc-
ess, especially one contained in law,
shouldn’t be controversial, and I don’t
think it is.
As such, I urge my colleagues to op-
pose the amendment offered by the
gentleman from Louisiana; protect our
coastlines from Maine to Florida, from
Washington State to California; and
support the process contained in the
OCS Lands Act.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr.
Chair, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Louisiana (Mr. ABRAHAM).
Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Chair, section
117 of this bill is just another example
of the anti-American energy agenda
being pushed by this Democratic ma-
jority.
The draft Outer Continental Shelf
leasing program proposed by the
Trump administration is actually a
forward-looking energy policy that
takes full advantage of our vast off-
shore oil and gas resources. This in-
cludes expanding lease sales in the
eastern Gulf of Mexico in a manner
that does not interfere with our crit-
ical defense mission.
In fact, fully utilizing our offshore
mineral resources in the Gulf is vital
to our national defense because it will
make the U.S. more energy inde-
pendent and will let us continue to be
the worldwide leader in energy produc-
tion.
The draft proposal in this program
will also create thousands of jobs and
boost economies of energy-producing
States like Louisiana.
We should not delay offshore mineral
leasing. Any attempt by the Democrats
to stop an America- and Louisiana-first
energy policy should be fought tooth
and nail.
Mr. Chair, I thank my good friend for
offering this amendment to strike sec-
tion 117, and I urge my colleagues to
support it.
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr.
Chair, let me run through a few points
here to see if I can clarify a number of
the remarks.
The base text of the bill actually pre-
vents the Department of the Interior
from carrying out the steps that are re-
quired.
Think about the concept of what was
said, Mr. Chair. It was said that they
want the Department of the Interior to
follow the law. Well, what would they
be doing otherwise?
The provision in the bill, section 117,
prevents them from carrying out pre-
leasing activities. This text prevents
them from being able to follow the law.
I am baffled by this, and I am happy
to have a much longer discussion on
how an offshore plan and leasing pro-
gram is put together.
What the base text of the bill does is
it tries to force the Obama-era plan
from ever being changed. The base text
prevents the process that is in the
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act
from being allowed to go forward.
Mr. Chair, what is really important
to talk about here, when you go back
to look at what energy policies and dif-
ferent administrative policies have
done, do you know that back during
the Obama administration in 2011, one
half of this Nation’s trade deficit was
attributable to us bringing in energy
from other sources, bringing them in
from foreign countries, empowering
their economies, creating jobs in their
countries?
I am an American. I represent people
here. I am trying to help make sure
that we have a healthy economy and
that we have affordable energy.
Mr. Chair, folks are going to try and
say, oh, this affects emissions and cli-
mate change. Our gas, which is replac-
ing the dirtier Russian natural gas, is
actually reducing global climate emis-
sions, which is part of our strategy
that has resulted in the United States
having greater emissions reduction
than any other country in the world.
It is really fun to go out and talk
about all these things, but we have to
keep this based in facts and statistics.
This amendment makes sense. It sim-
ply does allow the Department of the
Interior to follow the law, making sure
we maximize our resources.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I am sorry
to disagree, but I hope that my col-
leagues won’t be fooled by the com-
ments coming from the proponents of
this amendment.
This is not about energy security or
energy imports and exports. It is not
about jobs. Instead, this is about
whether the Interior Department is
going to be held to the same procedural
standard we expect every other depart-
ment and agency to adhere to.
b 1530
Mr. Chair, if my colleagues think the
Department of the Interior should fol-
low the law and complete the process,
then I urge them to oppose the gentle-
man’s amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.

The Acting CHAIR (Mr. HIMES). It is

No. 161 printed in part B of House Re-
port 116–119.
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division C (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll. Each amount made available by
this Act (other than an amount required to
be made available by a provision of law) is
hereby reduced by 23.6 percent.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Georgia (Mr. HICE) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Georgia.
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chairman, I rise today because of
my deep concerns over our national
debt.
At a time when our Federal debt ex-
ceeds $22 trillion, I believe it is time
that we make every effort possible to
rein in spending so that we are not
shackling future generations with this
burden.
Division C of H.R. 3055 funds the
EPA, Department of the Interior, and
other land management agencies at
$37.4 billion and increases spending by
$1.6 billion over fiscal year 2019 levels.
The spending level in this division is
23.6 percent over the President’s budget
request. That is almost $7 billion over
the request, Mr. Chairman. We are not
even close.
Without question, there are areas
within these Federal agencies that
need improvement. For example, we
need desperately to fix the National
Park Service maintenance backlog,
and I commend Ranking Member
BISHOP for his diligent work on that ef-
fort, and would urge passage, and at
least bring to the floor his thoughtful
and cost-effective bill to address that
issue. But at the end of the day, the
bottom line is our constituents back
home are required week after week,
month after month to make tough
choices when it comes to planning
their own household budgets, and we
need to do the same right here in Con-
gress.
My proposed amendment will reduce
spending levels to the President’s origi-
nal budget request so that, just like
our constituents back home, we go
back to the table, we go back to the
drawing board, and we make those
same tough decisions.
Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of my
amendment to rein in spending, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I rise in op-
position to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Maine is recognized for 5 minutes.
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I strongly
oppose this amendment. I appreciate
the thoughts of the gentleman, but this
is the wrong place to go about it.
This amendment just indiscrimi-
nately cuts programs in this bill with-
out any thought to the relative merit
of the programs contained in the bill.
For instance, this cut would result in
fewer patients seen at the Indian
Health Service, fewer safety inspectors
ensuring accidents do not occur, de-
ferred maintenance on our Nation’s
water and sanitation infrastructure.
More generally, investments in our
environmental infrastructure and our
public lands will be halted and the as-
sociated jobs will be lost.
This amendment would not encour-
age the agencies to do more with less.
Simply put, it would force the agencies
and our constituents to do less with
less.
Yes, it is true the Interior budget
does not meet the same numbers that
the President sent over to us, but the
President cut the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency by a third, he cut the
National Endowment for the Arts, the
National Endowment for the Human-
ities. I can make a very long list that
the President cut that this Congress
would never stand for.
So this does not stand. We cannot go
back to the President’s original budg-
et. We must stand together to oppose
this amendment, which if it was
passed, would harm the American peo-
ple.
Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment
and encourage my colleagues to join
me in opposing it, and I yield back the
balance of my time.

tleman from Georgia (Mr. HICE).

The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division C (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll. Each amount made available by
this division (other than an amount required
to be made available by a provision of law) is
hereby reduced by 14 percent.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Indiana (Mr. BANKS) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Indiana.
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chairman, my
amendment is simple. It reduces spend-
ing in this division by 14 percent, the
amount that is needed to avoid busting
the budget caps and preventing seques-
tration.
With these spending packages, my
colleagues on the other side of the aisle
are making it clear that they have no
interest in reducing our national debt.
If they did, they would not be pro-
posing bills that would bust the budget
caps by nearly $90 billion, which they
are fully aware would trigger seques-
tration and lead to devastating and se-
vere cuts to our national defense.
In this division alone, they are pro-
posing to spend $37.2 billion, which is
$1.73 billion above the previous year’s
enacted amount and $7.2 billion over
the President’s 2020 request. This does
not even include the $2.2 billion in ad-
ditional funding that is not subject to
the caps.
Again, my amendment would bring
spending in this division to the level
needed to avoid sequestration through
a 14 percent across-the-board cut.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Minnesota is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, this
amendment, once again, indiscrimi-
nately cuts programs in this bill with-
out any thought to the relative merit
of the programs contained in the bill.
To just reiterate again, fewer pa-
tients would be seen at Indian Health
Services, fewer safety inspectors would
be ensuring that we don’t have oil and
gas accidents on public lands or the
other areas which they oversee, de-
ferred maintenance on our Nation’s
drinking water—we don’t want another
Flint—deferred maintenance on sanita-
tion infrastructure.
One of the things that Members came
up and asked me for, by and large, to
make sure that we took a hard look to
see what we could do to make sure that
we protected our Nation’s drinking
water, and we moved on what we could
do with our sanitation infrastructure.
The National Estuary Program by
the President was zeroed out; the
USGS science was cut; school construc-
tion for Native American children, the
future of their communities, the future
of our shared Nation, zeroed out; the
arts, the humanities, zeroed out; and
the EPA cut by 31 percent, the agency
that is in charge of making sure we
have clean air and clean water.
More generally, investments in our
environmental infrastructure and our
public lands would be halted and the
associated jobs would be lost.
This legislation in front of us today
that we are talking about creates lots
of good jobs, lots of good-paying con-
struction jobs that are important to
the health of our communities.
This amendment would not encour-
age agencies to do more with less. They
would simply force the agencies and
our constituents to do less with less,
and they have been doing that for too
long.
Mr. Chair, I urge Members to oppose
this amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chairman, frankly,
the arguments from my colleagues who
oppose this amendment simply don’t
add up.
By busting the budget caps, the non-
defense programs that they are so pas-
sionately defending would face $55 bil-
lion in automatic cuts.
So it seems my colleagues are willing
to allow reductions in nondefense
spending if they can also force reckless
defense cuts that endanger national se-
curity.
While that may be acceptable to
those on the other side of the aisle, it
is not acceptable to me.
My amendment will bring spending
in this division to the level needed to
avoid sequestration and to protect our
national security.
Mr. Chairman, when I ran for this po-
sition, I promised my constituents that
I would do my part to rein in Washing-
ton’s spending addiction and safeguard
the strength of the American military.
Mr. Chair, I am proud that this
amendment accomplishes both of those
goals. I strongly urge my colleagues to
support it.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I yield
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from
Ohio (Mr. JOYCE), the ranking member
of the subcommittee.
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Chair, I rise
in reluctant opposition to the gentle-
man’s amendment.
Under Article I, section 9, clause 7 of
the Constitution: ‘‘No money shall be
drawn from the Treasury but in con-
sequence of appropriations made by
law.’’
That function resides within the ap-
propriately named Appropriations
Committee, and I take great pride in
having served on this committee.
Every year, we dedicate a great deal
of time to crafting and amending the
annual spending bills to fulfill this
constitutional responsibility and to
keep the Federal Government oper-
ating.
We spend countless hours hearing
from agency officials, outside advo-
cates, and our fellow Members of Con-
gress about our budgetary needs. We
make tough choices regarding
prioritization.
That is why I must oppose this
amendment and I oppose the previous
amendment.
Rather than evaluating the worthi-
ness of each individual program, the
amendment would indiscriminately cut
funding across the board.
Such drastic cuts could harm bipar-
tisan efforts to improve healthcare for
American Indians and Alaska Natives;
combat invasive species like Asian
carp and zebra mussels; prevent dev-
astating wildfires; address the mainte-
nance backlogs at National Park Serv-
ice and Fish and Wildlife Service sites;
and provide payments to local commu-
nities under the Payment in Lieu of
Taxes, or PILT, program.
Therefore, even though I share some
of the gentleman’s concerns about the
excessive spending in these bills, I
must oppose the amendment.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, may I in-
quire as to how much time is remain-
ing?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
has 11⁄2 minutes remaining.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, am I cor-
rect that the author of the amendment
has yielded back his time?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
has the only time remaining.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, first, I
would just like to address some of the
comments that the gentleman made.
I have the honor and privilege of
serving on the Appropriations Defense
Subcommittee as vice chair with
Chairman VISCLOSKY, and I take great
pride in the bipartisan work, the non-
partisan work that we do to make sure
that our military is strong and our in-
telligence agencies have the tools they
need to keep America safe.
Mr. Chair, I just wanted to add that
for the record, because there was, I
think, some confusion as to where I
and my colleagues on the Appropria-
tions Committee on both sides of the
aisle, when it came to defense, what
our positions were. Our positions are
making sure our servicemen and
-women have what they need to fulfill
their mission and come home safely.
But going back to the comments
about this amendment, we need to

There will be less clean water to

AMENDMENT NO. 165 OFFERED BY MR. BIGGS
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 165 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division C (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. lll. None of the funds made avail-
able by this Act may be used for the Inte-
grated Risk Information System of the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Arizona.
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, if I heard right, the
previous two amendments were criti-
cized for being overly broad and indis-
criminate in the ways that they at-
tacked spending in this particular un-
derlying legislation. Well, I am laser
focused. I am laser focused with my
amendment.
My amendment would restrict funds
from going to the EPA’s Integrated
Risk Information System, or IRIS.
That program is supposed to be devel-
oping impartial science-based toxicity
assessments on chemicals for uniform
use within EPA, and if that is what
they were doing, I would not be stand-
ing before you today. But as I came to
know all too well as I worked with
former Chairman Lamar Smith and
while serving as chairman of the
Science, Space, and Technology’s Sub-
committee on Environment in the last
Congress, the reality is different.
Over the past decade, IRIS has been
repeatedly criticized by the National
Academy of Sciences and the Govern-
ment Accountability Office for its lack
of transparency and improper use of
scientific methods, which have led to
some significantly flawed risk assess-
ments over the years. In fact, GAO
first added IRIS to its list of govern-
ment programs that are highly vulner-
able to waste, fraud, abuse, and mis-
management in 2009. In the decades
since, IRIS has made very few steps to-
wards significant improvement.
I strongly believe that instead of al-
lowing a flawed and poorly managed
agency like IRIS to continue to oper-
ate, we should return chemical assess-
ments to the relevant program offices
within the EPA itself.
In the last Congress, I introduced leg-
islation to achieve the reforms I have
outlined. That bill was reported out of
the Science, Space, and Technology
Committee last fall. I have reintro-
duced that bill again in this session,
but it is laying in the Science Com-
mittee without further action.
I believe that until there is a root-
and-branch reform of the chemical as-
sessments process at the EPA, we sim-
ply cannot allow IRIS to spread misin-
formation to the public as it is doing
now
I urge all Members to support my
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I claim
the time in opposition to this amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from Minnesota is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I would
like to clear up a little bit of informa-
tion.
There was a time a short while ago
where the National Academy of
Sciences asked the EPA, under the
IRIS program, to tighten up their proc-
ess. It needed fixing. It needed adjust-
ing.
The Agency reacted. They got an A-
plus rating from the scientists now. So
the fine-tuning that was unnecessary
to make this good program even great-
er happened.
But what this amendment would do
is it would prohibit the EPA from fund-
ing the Integrated Risk Information
System. Now, the Integrated Risk In-
formation System, or IRIS, is an elec-
tronic base containing information on
human health effects that may result
from exposure to various chemicals in
the environment.
This was developed by the EPA’s
staff with consistent information to
uniform risk assessments and regu-
latory decisionmaking with respect to
health effects from exposures to chemi-
cals found in the environment.
There is a chemical right now that
has captured the attention of people all
across the United States, in fact,
across the world, and it is PFOS.
We need now, more than ever, to be
laser focused, working with IRIS to do
everything we can to get the data and
the information so we know the health
effects from being exposed to these
chemicals for both military and civil-
ian people all across the United States.
It is a very serious problem, and IRIS’
program review process is widely con-
sidered to be a gold standard when it
comes to accessing chemical toxicity.
Now, it is based on extensive sci-
entific literature; it is peer-reviewed;
and IRIS’ toxicity assessments are re-
lied upon by programs at the EPA and
across the Federal Government, by
States, and it is because of the high
quality of the assessments.
Because these assessments assess
risk across a variety of exposure paths,
assessments can inform regulatory de-
cisionmaking across all media offices
in the EPA. So they can look at it ho-
listically and be making very informed
decisions.
It is no surprise, Mr. Chair, that the
chemical industry has long sought to
undermine the IRIS program. From
their point of view, the less the public
knows about the risk from toxic chemi-
cals, the more money the chemical in-
dustry can make. We ought to be look-
ing out for the safety and welfare of
the American people, not the bottom
line polluters who profit from pollu-
tion.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Chair, I just want to
clarify for those in the Chamber who
may not be aware, IRIS is an informa-
tion-collecting entity, not a regulator.
If IRIS were eliminated, EPA would
still maintain an office of research and
development, which would perform
chemical assessments in coordination
with a specialized program office with-
in the Agency. What will compromise
public safety is a poorly run govern-
ment office spreading misinformation.
I also want to point out that both the
nonpartisan NAS and GAO have repeat-
edly criticized IRIS over the past 10
years. Even the few NAS and GAO rec-
ognitions of improvements to IRIS
over the years have been strongly tem-
pered by caveats that far more work
needs to be done.
For instance, the 2018 NAS report,
which has been cited, suggests that
IRIS still has not produced a basic
handbook to guide its operations, even
though that recommendation was made
more than 4 years ago. This agency has
been in existence since 1986 without a
handbook, a basic handbook.
Just to add a little bit more color to
this debate, here is an example of how
absurd IRIS risk assessments can be. It
sets the risk value of the chemical
ethylene oxide, which is often used to
sterilize medical equipment, at 100
parts quadrillion. That is a 1 with 15
zeros behind it. That value is 19,000
times less than the naturally occurring
level of ethylene oxide in the human
body. For perspective, OSHA sets the
risk level for ethylene oxide at one
point per million, which is a vastly
higher threshold than IRIS itself.

June 20, 2019
I can speak similarly about flawed
IRIS risk assessments related to form-
aldehyde or acetone, a substance found
naturally in breast milk.
To sum up, absurdly assessed risk ei-
ther creates unwarranted public panic
or cynical disregard. Neither outcome
creates a safer society.
Even worse, if IRIS is overly focused
on evaluating the safety of low-risk or,
in some cases, effectively no-risk
chemicals, then it is likely to be dis-
tracted from assessing truly dangerous
substances.
Again, I invite my colleagues to sup-
port this very important laser-focused
amendment. We are not overly broad
here. We are focusing on one program
that has been completely—not repudi-
ated, but certainly been highly criti-
cized by the National Academy of
Science and the GAO.
I urge my fellow Members to support
this amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

AMENDMENT NO. 167 OFFERED BY MR.
CUNNINGHAM
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 167 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division C (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll None of the funds made available
by this Act may be used—
(1) to conduct or authorize any person to
conduct geological or geophysical explo-
ration for oil or gas, pursuant to section
11(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands
Act (43 U.S.C. 1340(a)), in any area located in
the Atlantic Region Outer Continental Shelf
Planning Areas, as such planning areas are
defined in the 2017-2022 Outer Continental
Shelf Oil and Gas Proposed Final Program
described in the notice entitled ‘‘Notice of
Availability of the 2017-2022 Outer Conti-
nental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Proposed
Final Program,’’ published by the Depart-
ment of the Interior in the Federal Register
on November 23, 2018 (81 Fed. Reg. 84,612); or
(2) to prepare or supplement an Environ-
mental Impact Statement or Environmental
Assessment, pursuant to the National Envi-
ronmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. § 4321
et seq.), and its associated regulations, for
any such exploration.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from South Carolina (Mr. CUNNINGHAM)
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from South Carolina.
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Chairman, I
rise today in support of my straight-
forward, commonsense amendment to
the Interior-Environment appropria-
tions bill that would prevent BOEM
from issuing permits for seismic explo-
ration in the Atlantic Ocean.
South Carolinians have made it ex-
plicitly clear where we stand on this
issue. Far too much is at stake in our
State. South Carolina’s tourism econ-
omy is worth $22.6 billion a year, and
two-thirds of that comes from the
coast.
While folks may disagree about the
amount of oil deposits that exist in the
Atlantic Ocean, most would agree that
the amount of oil off the coast of South
Carolina is minimal and far less than
the amount of revenue that the State
brings in from tourism, recreation, and
commercial fishing.
Put simply, the people of the
Lowcountry understand that the risk
isn’t worth the reward. Or, as may
grandmother said: ‘‘The juice ain’t
worth the squeeze.’’
Our beaches, our economy are not for
sale.
And it is not just South Carolina
that feels this way. It is Florida. It is
Virginia. It is New Hampshire. It is
North Carolina. It is Pennsylvania. It
is New Jersey, Oregon, and Wash-
ington. From coast to coast, commu-
nities have made it clear that they do
not want to put the marine ecosystems
and their coastal livelihoods at risk,
which is why so many of my colleagues
from all over the country have joined
me in sponsoring this amendment.
Seismic exploration is incredibly
dangerous in its own right. Seismic air
guns create an underwater blast louder
than all but military-grade explosives.
Companies fire air guns as often as
every 10 seconds for days, weeks, to
months on end. This can have impacts
across the entire ecosystem, from ma-
rine mammals to fish to plankton.
But beyond that, seismic exploration
is a major step towards this adminis-
tration’s ultimate goal of seeing drill-
ing rigs up and down the Atlantic
coast. High-ranking officials have said
it clear as day: The only reason they
are working so hard on these seismic
permits is so they can open up the At-
lantic to drilling by the highest bidder.
Drilling in the Atlantic would put
the health of our ocean and our coastal
economy at risk, and it is a massive in-
vestment in a future of dirty and dan-
gerous offshore drilling that an over-
whelming majority of people from both
parties all along the Atlantic Coast op-
pose. I stand with them in opposition
to both seismic testing and oil drilling.
Far too much is at stake.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr.
Chairman, I claim time in opposition
to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Louisiana is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr.
Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR).
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, we had
the same discussion yesterday. Once
again, these are offshore leases that
are part of the American public’s do-
main, not the State of South Carolina
or California or Massachusetts or Flor-
ida. I understand that application.
But, once again, we also have heard
that we want to have responsible re-
newable energy, so we are actually pre-
disposing no seismic aspect. Well, how
do you actually look at moorings in re-
gard to subsurface anchors if you
didn’t use seismic activity? That is
contradicting all the way around the
aspect here.
Once again, this just shows that we
want nothing of the sort: no seismic,
no wind, no solar, no oil and gas. That
is unbelievable.
If this is the kind of attitude that we
want going forward, those in Arizona
and the Western States that have pub-
lic lands ought to be getting a lot more
say in those applications.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentleman has expired.
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr.
Chairman, I yield an additional 20 sec-
onds to the gentleman from Arizona.
Mr. GOSAR. And when we start look-
ing at it, maybe what we ought to do,
if we are talking about oil spills, one of
the worst ways to actually import oil
is through boats. So maybe we ought to
disallow ships, because a ship that has
an accident is one oil spill away from
anywhere.
So this just begs my indifference in
regards to what the heck we are trying
to do here. It is looking at our assets.
We have a due diligence to the Amer-
ican people to look at those assets for
public assets.
b 1600
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Chair, re-
spectfully, I would disagree with Mr.
GOSAR. South Carolinians have the op-
portunity to say what goes on off of
South Carolina’s coast. Voters have
made it very clear on this issue.
This is not Democrat or a Republican
issue. This is an issue that has been
supported by Republican Governor
McMaster, who has made it clear that
he opposes offshore drilling.
I would ask that my conservative
Members of this body, that that con-
servative idealogy also translates to
conserving our natural resources, and
for that idea of federalism to extend to
offshore drilling so that States have a
say. And States have spoken in South
Carolina, and other States as well.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr.
Chairman, let’s break this apart a lit-
tle bit. So my friend from South Caro-
lina has proposed this amendment be-
cause he wants to protect the environ-
ment.
Well, let’s look at what happens
when you do this.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4974 June 20, 2019
My friend sat in the House Com-
mittee on Natural Resources where we
had experts, not people standing here
behind the microphone, but real ex-
perts who came to the Congress, who
testified before us, and who said: We
have looked at this issue when you
stop producing energy domestically.
We have looked at it. And what hap-
pens when you stop producing it do-
mestically? You import it. You import
it from foreign countries.
All right. So, one, you are not stop-
ping the production of energy. You are
just doing it in another country, and
you are paying them and creating jobs
there.
Number two, when you do this, you
still have to actually ship the energy.
It doesn’t just pop up in the socket.
You have to ship the energy.
Look at the studies. Look at the re-
ports. You have a greater chance of
threatening your global environment,
threatening the coast of South Caro-
lina by transporting it by ship.
Look at the statistics. It is safer to
do exploration and production activi-
ties, to put it in a pipe in the United
States.
Mr. Chairman, my friend was there
and heard the witnesses talk about
this. It is important that we make sure
that we are doing things that don’t just
feel good, but things that will actually
achieve the goal of protecting our envi-
ronment in the United States. This
amendment is flawed.
Now, look. The other thing, Mr.
Chairman, I think is important is what
this prohibits is it prohibits us from
actually doing a resource assessment.
Maybe there is an assessment and it is
determined that it doesn’t make sense
to produce energy there. Well, let’s
make an informed decision.
Last thing, Mr. Chairman, is about
ecological productivity. Off the coast
of Louisiana, where we reproduce
somewhere between 80 and 90 percent of
all of the offshore energy, the conven-
tional energy in the United States in
Federal waters, we have the second
most productive fisheries in the Na-
tion, only behind Alaska, another
State that does offshore energy produc-
tion. We have multiple times more
fisheries than my friend’s home State
of South Carolina.
So the whole ecological productivity
argument is just not supported by the
facts. If you support the environment,
if you support ecological productivity,
if you support American jobs, you op-
pose this amendment. If you support
Russian gas, if you support Vladimir
Putin, if you support a dirtier environ-
ment, I urge you to vote in support of
this amendment.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Chair, I
thank my colleagues, again, especially
my colleagues on the other side of the

and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from South Carolina.
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Chair, I want
to recognize the great work of Chair-
woman MCCOLLUM in finding ways to
increase funding for the Land and
Water Conservation Fund. The chair-
woman and members of the committee
have shown a strong commitment to
this important program, and I applaud
their efforts.
One of the first things that Congress
did was pass into law the bipartisan
lands package, which permanently au-
thorized the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund. This demonstrated what we
can achieve when we work together on
behalf of our constituents.
LWCF not only promotes access to
our public lands, but helps ensure all
Americans can utilize these publicly
owned resources. It is important that
we build off that bipartisan work by
making sure that this important pro-
gram receives the funding it deserves
in our final spending bill.
LWCF provides hundreds of millions
of dollars to States that are challenged
with coastal erosion, loss of open
space, and trying to balance a need to
protect species habitat with urban
growth demands.
It also supports our States and com-
munities by funding stateside pro-
grams that promote recreation, respon-
sible community development, and pro-
vide opportunities to get Americans
outdoors.
When LWCF was created, it was
agreed that funding from oil and gas
development would be used to achieve
conservation objectives across the
country. This program balances re-
source development with conservation
and opens access to our public lands for
hunters, anglers, and back country
users.
I strongly support LWCF, and I ap-
preciate the efforts my colleagues have
made to secure the future of this pro-
gram. I urge my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle to vote in support of
my amendment, as well as the under-
lying bill.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise in
opposition to the amendment, even
though I am not opposed to it.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Arizona is
recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, once
again, I have been sitting on the floor.
I sat in the House Committee on Nat-
ural Resources yesterday and heard
this assault on oil and gas. So I want to
remind everybody that the only mecha-
nism to fund LWCF is actually these
funds from the Outer Continental Shelf
oil and gas.
It is amazing. It is absolutely amaz-
ing that we have this rhetorical con-
versation on the House floor.
So we are against adding any access
to know what the resource actually is
by seismic. We are responsible on be-
half of these resources to the American
public. Yes, the American public actu-
ally owns these jurisdictions. And what
we are doing is we are leveraging as
that opportunity to fund LWCF.
Be careful, Will Robinson, what you
are asking for.
Those responsible applications, we
heard it over and over from the gen-
tleman from Louisiana. Once again,
these are an asset of the American peo-
ple, not South Carolina, not Florida,
not California, not Massachusetts. So
responsible applications here, we have
got to be taking in good stewardship.
So with that in mind, I caution ev-
erybody that LWCF is the only mecha-
nism for funding. The only mechanism
for funding is these Outer Continental
Shelf oil and gas leases.
These are responsible aspects, and
they actually know what the resources
are. You are going to need seismic, if
you are going to look at alternative en-
ergy aspects, particularly wind, in re-
gards to permanent moorings.
So from that standpoint, I just offer
a cautionary plea. Be careful what you
ask for. You may end up having no
funding at all.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Chair, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlemen from
Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE), my esteemed
colleague.
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chair, I want to
thank my distinguished colleague from

June 20, 2019
South Carolina for his leadership on
this amendment.
With respect to the Member from Ar-
izona, I, given his comments, look for-
ward to him voting for this amendment
as well. It is an incredibly important
amendment, and, ultimately, this pro-
gram has been our Nation’s premier
conservation program for over 50 years.
I would like to thank the Appropria-
tions Committee for their work to
reprioritize the program after the
President’s budget actually proposed
drastic cuts to LWCF. As a result of
their efforts, the bill before us today
would provide the highest level of fund-
ing for the program in 17 years.
I have the great honor of rep-
resenting the State of Colorado, and I
have seen firsthand the benefits that
LWCF brings to our State. Colorado re-
ceived $278 million in LWCF funding
over the last decades, including for a
variety of areas in my district: Rocky
Mountain National Park, Arapaho and
Roosevelt National Forests, to name
just a few.
LWCF not only conserves critical
land; it is an investment in outdoor
recreation economies. Studies have
shown that every dollar invested in the
LWCF is $4 in economic value from
natural resource goods and services.
Mr. Chair, I appreciate the distin-
guished gentleman from South Caro-
lina for bringing forth this amendment.
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote.
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Chair, I
thank my colleagues for their commit-
ment to the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund and for joining me in offer-
ing this commonsense amendment.
Mr. Chair, I would urge all my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to
vote in favor of this amendment, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tleman from South Carolina (Mr.
CUNNINGHAM).
The question was taken; and the Act-

AMENDMENT NO. 176 OFFERED BY MR. CARBAJAL
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 176 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Chairman, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division C (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll None of the funds made available
by this Act may be used by the Department
of the Interior to conduct oil and gas leasing,
preleasing, or related activities in the Wash-
ington/Oregon, Northern California, Central
California, and Southern California Outer
Continental Shelf Planning Areas.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentleman
from California (Mr. CARBAJAL) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Chair, I am of-
fering an amendment to make it clear
to the administration that we will not
sit idly by as they attempt to open up
our shores to further oil and gas devel-
opment. We will not allow our treas-
ured natural resources to be sold to Big
Oil, and we will not put corporate prof-
its above protecting our environment
and our local coastal economies.
My amendment would put in place a
moratorium on offshore oil and gas
drilling and related activities in the
four planning areas off the Pacific
Outer Continental Shelf for fiscal year
2020.
My constituents on the central Coast
have seen firsthand the devastating im-
pacts of some of the largest oil spills in
California history, like the 1969 Santa
Barbara oil spill. Most recently, the
2015 Plains All American oil spill in my
district cost $92 million to clean up.
These incidents show us that we cannot
afford yet another disastrous oil spill.
In contrast, California’s coastal re-
gion generates over $1.9 trillion of GDP
and supports more than $731 billion in
wages.
Future oil drilling would pose a di-
rect threat to our local economies,
businesses, and tourism, which are tied
to our clean oceans and healthy eco-
system.
Since the 1969 oil spill in Santa Bar-
bara, there has not been a new or ex-
panded lease in California State
waters, or one in Federal waters since
1984.
This policy has enjoyed support from
both Republican and Democratic ad-
ministrations. Yet this administration
today seems tone deaf to this reality.
Instead, they are asking to hold seven
new lease sales in the four planning
areas off the Pacific Outer Continental
Shelf.
I urge passage of my amendment,
which would protect nearly 650,000 jobs
in our region.
Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Washington (Mr. KIL-
MER).
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chair, I thank Mr.
CARBAJAL, my good friend, for his lead-
ership on this amendment.
I am proud to cosponsor this amend-
ment which would prohibit future oil
and gas sales off the West Coast, in-
cluding my beautiful home State of
Washington.
The fact is the people of Washington
State don’t support drilling off our
coast. Our commercial and rec-
reational fishermen who generate bil-
lions in economic impact for our State
don’t want to see our fisheries com-
promised by another disaster like the
1988 spill which released more than
230,000 gallons of oil and affected over
110 miles of our coastline.
The 17 Native American Tribes who
have fished throughout the Puget
Sound watershed since time immemo-
rial don’t want to see our coastline ex-
posed to these harmful and polluting
activities.
Our shellfish growers, who support
roughly 3,200 jobs in our State, don’t
want to see their jobs threatened. They
saw how the Deepwater Horizon spill
devastated Louisiana’s coastal econ-
omy.
b 1615
Coastal towns including Ocean
Shores, Westport, Aberdeen, Hoquiam,
Montesano, Long Beach, and Ilwaco
have passed resolutions saying they
don’t want it.
Even former Department of the Inte-
rior Secretary Zinke in his testimony
before the Appropriations Committee
last year admitted that the oil and gas
industry doesn’t want to drill off the
coast of Washington because there
aren’t the resources or infrastructure
to do it.
He also said, ‘‘I think I’m going to
mark down Washington as opposed to
drilling.’’
Mr. Chair, I believe this body ought
to mark Washington State down as off-
limits to drilling, and this amendment
does that.
This matters to our economy. It mat-
ters to our region’s identity. The sur-
vival of the last 76 southern resident
orca left in the world depends on keep-
ing the Puget Sound protected from
the harmful impacts of oil and gas de-
velopment.
There is a lot at stake here. That is
why I urge my colleagues to support
the will of the residents of the State of
Washington and pass this amendment.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I rise in oppo-
sition to the amendment.
The Acting Chair. The gentleman
from Arizona is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, we don’t need
a moratorium off the coast of Cali-
fornia. We actually need a resurgence
in domestic energy development off-
shore.
I heard from the gentleman that the
last oil spill was in 1969. Let’s see, it is
2019. Fifty years later, technology has
been much different.
While the local demand for oil in
California has dropped over the last 40
years, foreign dependence has increased
from 5 percent to 57 percent.
In 2018, California imported 135 mil-
lion barrels of oil from Saudi Arabia
alone. According to the national off-
shore energy industry, leasing in the
240 million acres of currently off-limits
areas would support an additional
165,000 jobs and inject $15 billion in an-
nual contributions to the economy.
There are already 23 active oil plat-
forms in Federal waters adjacent to
California. Once again, let me repeat,
there are 23 active oil platforms in Fed-
eral waters adjacent to California.
These platforms produced nearly 17,000
barrels of oil per day in 2016 and

brought in $32.8 million in total royal-
ties in fiscal year 2016. In a State that
is importing 57.5 percent of its refined
oil from foreign nations, it is impera-
tive that we take the opportunity to
utilize domestic energy supply.
Once again, let’s highlight that: 57.5
percent is from overseas, which is
much dirtier than what we produce
here. If we are concerned about climate
change and emissions, we ought to be
importing less and looking at what we
actually do.
Last but not least, I would like to re-
mind everybody that we just had a con-
versation on the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund, which is funded exclu-
sively by Outer Continental Shelf oil
and gas. Once again, the people who
don’t want this for their States, maybe
they should turn down LWCF funding
because it seems contradictory to the
conversation.
Once again, I remind my colleagues
that Federal waters belong to the U.S.
people, not the States of California,
Florida, South Carolina, or Massachu-
setts. We have a due diligence to look
at the management of those resources.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. CÁRDENAS. Mr. Chair, clearly,
my colleague from Arizona was not
paying attention. The last oil spill was
in 2014.
Again, I will state that what we need
to be doing is weaning ourselves off fos-
sil fuels and investing in renewable en-
ergy like most progressive countries
are doing.
The West Coast, California, and the
coast of the 24th Congressional District
cannot tolerate another oil spill. The
benefits of oil exploration and develop-
ment off our coasts do not outweigh
the risks. We need to keep that in
mind. For a Representative from the
State of Arizona, which is landlocked,
which hasn’t experienced the perils of
such oil spills to their economy, their
workers, or their jobs, keep that in
mind.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentleman from California has expired.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, yes, I am
landlocked by California, but you know
the old adage. I am waiting for ocean-
front property in Arizona, as the song
goes.
Once again, let’s take a look at this.
When we start talking about offshore
assets for the Outer Continental Shelf,
there is less jurisdiction with regard to
that versus what we do on-shore. If we
are giving this type of leverage to
States with offshore assets, we ought
to be giving those States like Arizona,
Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and Mon-
tana more jurisdictions because the
law is better on their side than it is
with those on offshore.
Once again, I find it interesting that
we have a dichotomy here. We are all
for the Land and Water Conservation
Fund, but we are unwilling to look at
the resources it takes and where they
are derived from to make sure that
that is permanently, in perpetuity,
funded.
Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from California (Mr.
CARBAJAL).
The question was taken; and the Act-

AMENDMENT NO. 187 OFFERED BY MS. HILL OF

to consider amendment No. 187 printed
in part B of House Report 116–119.
Ms. HILL of California. Mr. Chair, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. HILL) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
Ms. HILL of California. Mr. Chair, it
is hard to overstate the devastating ef-
fects of lengthening fire seasons across
the United States, especially in my
home State of California.
I represent three diverse valleys in
California’s 25th Congressional Dis-
trict, across northern Los Angeles and
Ventura County, and all of them have
had significant wildfires and forest
fires in the last year.
In fact, 2018 was the deadliest fire
season in California’s history. Accord-
ing to CAL FIRE and the National
Interagency Fire Center, 8,527 fires
burned a total of 1,893,913 acres, the
largest area on record.
Not only are these fires larger and
more frequent, but they are also hotter
and more intense. Soon, the term ‘‘fire
tornadoes’’ will be a phrase that many
people are familiar with.
My own house was evacuated last
summer. We had to trailer my horse
and relocate my goats and dogs to my
sister’s house. My sister’s house was
evacuated shortly thereafter. Sadly,
this is not the first time I or my family
has had to evacuate. It has practically
become a common occurrence for peo-
ple in areas like ours.
Two days after I found out that I
would be coming to Washington to rep-
resent my community, three people
died in the Woolsey fire, part of which
burned through my district in Simi
Valley.
We have to do more. I am thankful
for the opportunity to put forth this
amendment that provides additional
funds for wildland fire management
and hazardous fuels work. I am offering
it to highlight the funding that is al-
ready in this bill to prepare for, com-
bat, and reduce the risk of future cata-
strophic wildfires and to make sure we
do more.
These funds are critical because when
the Forest Service does not have
enough fire suppression funds, they
have to borrow from mitigation ac-
counts to pay for fire suppression ac-
tivities. This fire borrowing delays the
very activities that improve forest
health and reduce wildfire risk.
We cannot simply treat the effects.
We have to treat the cause. But preven-
tion takes funding, and that is why
this bill and this amendment are so im-
portant.
For the first time, this bill includes
$2.25 billion in fire cap adjusted funds.
These additional funds ensure that our
firefighters will have the resources
they need to combat wildfires without
fire borrowing, meaning that we will
invest in the prevention solutions that
we know work.
However, we will only have the cap
adjusted funds for 2 years. We must all
work together to ensure that any budg-
et agreement includes fire cap adjusted
funds for future budget years as well.
That is how we can make lasting
change on this front.
For my community, for California,
and for States across the country expe-
riencing the devastating effects of
wildfires, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOL-
LUM).
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I rise in
support of this amendment, and I
thank the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia for bringing it forward.
This bill provides substantial funding
to prevent and suppress wildfires. For
the first time, this bill includes $2.25
billion in cap adjusted fire suppression
funding, for a total of $5.2 billion for
wildland fire management.
Forest Service research and develop-
ment is increased by $10 million to ad-
vance the understanding of wildland
fires and climate adaptation.
While the administration proposed to
eliminate the Joint Fire Science Pro-
gram, this bill includes funding at the
fiscal year 2019 enacted level of $6 mil-
lion.
Hazardous fuels is $27 million more.
I would like to take this opportunity
to remind my colleagues that we only
have the fire cap adjusted funds for 2
years. We must ensure that any budget
agreement includes the fire cap ad-
justed funds in future budget years.
These critical funds will allow the For-
est Service to fight wildland fires with-
out borrowing from nonfire programs.
Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentle-
woman’s efforts to reduce the risk of

At the end of division C (before the short

SEC. ll. None of the funds made available
by this Act may be used to finalize the pro-
posed revised supplemental ‘‘appropriate and
necessary’’ finding in the proposed rule enti-
tled ‘‘National Emission Standards for Haz-
ardous Air Pollutants: Coal- and Oil-Fired
Electric Utility Steam Generating Units—
Reconsideration of Supplemental Finding
and Residual Risk and Technology Review’’
published by the Environmental Protection
Agency in the Federal Register on February
7, 2019 (84 Fed. Reg. 2670).
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 445, the gentlewoman
from Washington (Ms. SCHRIER) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Washington.
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Chair, I rise today
to speak on my amendment prohibiting
funds from being used to undermine
the EPA’s Mercury and Air Toxics
Standards, or MATS.
These regulations have been imple-
mented by the power sector and have
protected children and communities
from mercury, lead, arsenic, and other
air toxics from power plants for the
past 7 years.
Furthermore, the administration’s
proposal to jeopardize mercury stand-
ards isn’t even supported by the power
industry. They have already spent bil-
lions to comply, and major power sec-
tors and labor groups have asked that
the standards be left in place and that
the EPA does not move forward with
its proposal to undermine them.
Finalized in 2012, the EPA recognized
the significant public health benefits of
MATS. Then, the EPA estimated that
MATS would yield up to $90 billion in
public health benefits each year. Now,
MATS is fully implemented and has
shown to be lifesaving, preventing
more than 11,000 premature deaths
every year and 130,000 asthma attacks
each year.
As a pediatrician, I have seen first-
hand the impact of air pollution on our
children. Pregnant women and children
are particularly vulnerable when they
are exposed to heavy metals, which im-
pact the central nervous system with
potentially devastating effects on neu-
ral development.
What we are talking about here is a
known public health risk to millions of
people. We cannot abandon a policy
that has already been proven to work
and save lives. MATS has already been
shown to prevent premature deaths,
adverse effects on pregnant women and
children, and health problems like
asthma.
It is critical that we protect our chil-
dren and families from the well-docu-
mented health risks posed by mercury
and heavy metals and prohibit tax-
payer dollars from being used to roll
back these safeguards.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment, and I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms.
MCCOLLUM).
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I rise in
support of the amendment from the
gentlewoman from Washington to
block the Trump administration from
trying to weaken Mercury and Air
Toxics Standards for power plants.
Power plants across the country, as
has been pointed out, have already
complied with the rule. In fact, they
have been doing it since 2012, and it has
given huge health benefits.
b 1630
The power sector opposes what the
Trump EPA is trying to do, unions op-
pose what the Trump EPA is trying to
do, and so do States and public health
communities.
Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentle-
woman for bringing this amendment
forward, and I urge my colleagues to
support this commonsense amendment.
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Chairman, in clos-
ing, I urge my colleagues to support
this amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I claim the
time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Arizona is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, the EPA’s an-
nouncement in late December intended
to revise the cost-benefit findings be-
hind the MATS aspects and benefits.
The Obama-era EPA’s own estimate of
the cost implementing MATS exceeded
its estimate of benefits by 1,233 to 2,400
times, an absurdity papered over by
the accounting trick of double count-
ing as co-benefits reductions in non-
mercury emissions as though these re-
ductions were already achieved under
other regulations.
The financial costs of this implemen-
tation are between $4 to $5 million an-
nually—no, I am sorry—$9.5 billion an-
nually.
Once again, the rule hasn’t even been
put out yet.
Don’t you think we ought to be wait-
ing to find out what the actual rule is
before we say no go?
Because we don’t even know where it
goes.
We also want to take a look at cata-
strophic wildfires. Catastrophic
wildfires are the largest aspect in re-
gard to contaminants into the air as
we witnessed in hazardous breathing
times, particularly in Montana and
California. So from that standpoint, I
urge a ‘‘no’’ vote against this one be-
cause it is premature to actually what
the rule is coming out.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Chairman, I would
simply request that my opposition, my
colleague, double check his facts. This
is well-documented. This is effective. It
is cost saving, and the costs have al-
ready been paid by the energy sector.
This is something that they do not
even want to see rolled back.
Mr. Chairman, it protects public
health. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

H4978 June 20, 2019
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, as
the designee of the gentlewoman from
Texas (Ms. GRANGER), I move to strike
the last word.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I
yield to the distinguished gentleman
from California (Mr. LAMALFA).
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Chairman, I rise
tonight in support of increasing the
productivity of our national forestland.
Somehow, America is the world’s num-
ber two importer of lumber, and at the
same time our forests continue to burn
at an unprecedented rate. We need to
get our forests back in working order.
The majority provided $276 million
for forest products, which is an in-
crease of $7 million above the enacted
level and $4 million below the Presi-
dent’s budget request.
My amendment would support job
growth and increased timber produc-
tion to support forest health and pro-
mote safe communities. This funding is
critical to support the President’s ex-
ecutive order on forest management
that involves a plan to sell 3.7 billion
board feet of timber and improve over
1.1 million acres of national forestland
to mitigate wildfire risk.
Right now there are 150 million dead
trees just in my home State of Cali-
fornia. If we don’t act now to dedicate
more resources toward timber manage-
ment, we won’t have any forest left to
manage. Instead, we will be watching
them burn, foul the air, and foul our
water with ash; and in the meantime,
we are still importing wood products.
For example, as a result of the 2018
Carr fire in West Redding, California,
which burned approximately 230,000
acres and eight people lost their lives,
we also lost the Whiskeytown National
Recreation Area encompassing 318
square miles which burned to the
ground.
We need to increase the pace and
scale of forest production and wildfire
mitigation in a way that makes busi-
ness sense and includes the private sec-
tor.
Mr. Chairman, 62 percent of
forestlands in my district are federally
owned. The remaining private forests
in my district generate 73,000 jobs, con-
tribute $4 billion in manufacturing and
sales and supports $1.7 billion in pay-
roll.
There should be no reason our Fed-
eral forests cannot produce the same
benefits and results to its employees
and community as the private sector
can.
Let’s focus on protecting public
health, creating jobs, enjoying the
great outdoors by reducing fire risks,
and generating economic growth to
rural communities across the U.S.
Mr. Chairman, I thank the House for
passage of my amendment.
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I
move that the Committee do now rise.
The motion was agreed to.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.
MCCOLLUM) having assumed the chair,
Mr. HIMES, Acting Chair of the Com-
mittee of the Whole House on the state
of the Union, reported that that Com-

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL
POLLINATOR WEEK
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of National Polli-
nator Week. I am honored to be the
Representative of three cities each
named a Monarch City U.S.A.: Oak
Harbor, Port Clinton, and Sandusky,
Ohio. They are bestowed this title for
their citizenries’ efforts to support the
monarch butterfly, a noble and sub-
stantial pollinator, by planting milk-
weed and nectar plants.
With beekeepers having lost 40 per-
cent of their bee colonies last year, it
is imperative that Congress follow my
constituents’ lead to protect and sup-
port pollinator populations. The 2018
farm bill and the fiscal year 2020 Agri-
culture appropriations bill prioritized a
commitment to the welfare of polli-
nators for the sake of human life. The
farm bill authorized the Honey Bee and
Pollinator Research Coordinator, and
the Appropriations Committee funded
the position to strengthen our research
and protect pollinators from extinc-
tion.
In the spirit of National Pollinator
Week and as an honored cosponsor of
the Saving America’s Pollinators Act
of 2019, please join me in celebrating
the beauty and utility and essential
presence in our environment of one of
nature’s finest constructs: pollinators.

RAISING AWARENESS FOR PTSD
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4998 June 20, 2019
After trauma or a life-threatening
event, it is common to have reactions
such as upsetting memories, increased
jumpiness, or trouble sleeping.
PTSD was not always properly under-
stood by the medical professional and
society, but today there are great orga-
nizations and resources that can help
both individuals and professionals dis-
cover ways to identify and manage
PTSD symptoms and explore effective
treatments.
PTSD is especially prevalent for
those who have served in the military,
affecting nearly 30 percent of Vietnam
veterans and up to 20 percent of vet-
erans who served during the global war
on terror. A nonservicemember may be
exposed to a single traumatic event
that can also cause PTSD.
Madam Speaker, as a former reha-
bilitation therapist, I have seen the in-
credible strides that people with inju-
ries can make with access to appro-
priate rehabilitation. I applaud all the
organizations that raise awareness
about this important issue during the
month of June. There is help and sup-
port for those who have PTSD.

HONORING EDWIN R. JONES, JR.
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, re-
cently, the Collings Lakes Fire Depart-
ment held a parade celebrating 55 years
of service and dedicated a new fire
truck in honor of the late deputy chief,
Edwin R. Jones, Jr.
Ed took on many roles throughout
his life, most of them involving him
giving of himself and of his time with-
out expecting anything but to see
someone smile.
Ed began his career as a volunteer
firefighter, and when he moved to
Collings Lakes in Atlantic County, he
joined the fire department to serve as
an engineer. Throughout his 40-year ca-
reer with the fire department, Ed
served in many roles, including treas-
urer, vice president, fire commissioner,
and he was serving as the deputy chief
when he passed away in 2017.
Ed is remembered. He is remembered
by his family, his coworkers, and his
friends for being a selfless, caring pres-
ence in our community, and his loss is
felt by many.
Ed was a true American hero.

PROTECTING AMERICANS WITH
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to express my disappointment in
the missed opportunity this House had
this week to protect individuals with
preexisting conditions.
Since the Democrats took the major-
ity in January, they have stoked fear
with the American public that the ad-
ministration will remove these protec-
tions; however, maintaining the cur-
rent coverage requirements for those
with preexisting conditions is an issue
that Republicans and Democrats in
this body agree on. That is why I co-
sponsored Congressman RODNEY DAVIS’
amendment to H.R. 2740 that would
have prohibited any funds at the De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices from being used to weaken the ex-
isting safeguards.
However, every single Democrat on
the Rules Committee voted to prevent
this amendment from even being de-
bated by the full House. Instead, they
would rather continue to politicize the
issue and stoke fear that these critical
protections are in imminent danger of
being taken away.
I urge this body to stop sowing dis-
cord on issues we agree on and to work
towards bipartisan solutions that ben-
efit the people we serve.

RECOGNIZING WAYNE METROPOLI-
TAN COMMUNITY ACTION AGEN-
CY
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, it is a
great honor to recognize Wayne Metro-
politan Community Action Agency’s
After-School 21st Century Learning
Centers program participants. The
young people who have participated in
this program have shown initiative and
growth.
Wayne Metropolitan Community Ac-
tion Agency has been a resource for the
people of Wayne County. Their wrap-
around programming demonstrates an
understanding that investing in our
children is investing in a better future
and better quality of life for all the
residents in the 13th Congressional Dis-
trict. The young people who have par-
ticipated in this program have shown
determination to achieve their highest
potential.
It is an honor to recognize our young
people in this program and, hopefully,
be able to show that they can be an in-
vestment for the future, and I acknowl-
edge their outstanding accomplish-
ment.

HONORING KENNETH DWYER
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lieu-
tenant Colonel Kenneth Dwyer for
nearly 20 years of exceptional service
to our country.
Lieutenant Colonel Dwyer started his
career in the military as a Special
Forces officer, where he was deployed
to Afghanistan on three separate oper-
ations.
In 2006, during his third deployment,
he was critically injured by a grenade,
losing both his left hand and his left
eye. This incident only fueled his de-
sire to fight for his Nation.
Through his ongoing perseverance, he
rose through the ranks to become com-
mander of Hunter Army Airfield in the
First Congressional District of Geor-
gia. With Lieutenant Colonel Dwyer as
head of Hunter Army Airfield, the in-
stallation won the Army Community of
Excellence Award for 2019, which recog-
nizes bases for troop morale, soldier
readiness, innovation, community in-
volvement, and more.
Lieutenant Colonel Dwyer passed the
baton to Lieutenant Colonel Escobar to
command Hunter Army Airfield on
June 13.
Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel
Dwyer for all of your hard work at
Hunter and for making this an installa-
tion that everyone in the First Con-
gressional District of Georgia can be
proud of.

JUSTICE FOR JOSUE FLORES
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
for a very long time, the entire com-
munity, including his neighborhood,
the Near Northside, mourned the loss
of a wonderful little boy by the name
of Josue Flores.
We mourn with his family members
and his neighborhood. What a loving
neighborhood.
We stood by the tree in the area in
which he was murdered, stabbed many
times. There were investigations and
arrests, and then there were no arrests,
and the community still mourned.
I want to applaud the Near Northside
for continuing to remember Josue Flo-
res, as well the Safe Work Coalition,
ensuring that no child would ever walk
home to be victimized in that neigh-
borhood again.
Many law enforcement officers and
civil rights groups and others work to-
gether, civic neighborhood groups—the
Near Northside Super Neighborhood—
but now there is finally an arrest. We
hope that justice is rendered for that
family and justice is rendered for this
whole act that we hope never happens
again.
We mourn him. We want it to be fair
and just. But we want Josue Flores to
rest in peace and want this proceeding
to move forward so that this family
can have peace and this neighborhood
can be assured that their children can
be safe again.
I will work with them continuously,
as we did, to ensure that law enforce-
ment is there for them and the commu-
nity is there for them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4999
June 20, 2019
today to recognize the life and memory
of a law enforcement professional who
served the people of Bucks County,
Pennsylvania, for over two decades.
Steven F. Hillias, chief of police to the
Perkasie Borough Police Department,
passed away on Sunday at the age of 49.
Born in Allentown, Chief Hillias was
a graduate of Allentown Central Catho-
lic High School and went on to receive
a degree in management from Penn
State. Chief Hillias later attended the
FBI National Academy and received a
master’s degree in criminal justice
from DeSales University.
Chief Hillias joined the Perkasie Bor-
ough Police Department in 1997 and
was elevated to chief of police in 2014.
Well-respected in the law enforcement
community, Chief Hillias was a mem-
ber of the Police Chiefs Association of
Bucks County and the Fraternal Order
of Police.
Chief Hillias was known as an ap-
proachable, community-oriented chief
who cared deeply about the Perkasie
community. He worked tirelessly and
with empathy to combat the opioid epi-
demic and advocated for young offend-
ers in diversionary programs. He was a
man admired for his fairness and his
compassion.
Madam Speaker, I send my deepest
condolences to Chief Hillias’ wife,
Tracy, and his children, Michael and
Lauren. We thank them for sharing
him with our community.
May Chief Hillias enjoy his eternal
reward for a life he spent serving oth-
ers.

CONGRATULATING PROSPER HIGH
SCHOOL MEN’S LACROSSE TEAM
(Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today
I rise to congratulate the Prosper High
School men’s lacrosse team for bring-
ing home their first State champion-
ship title by defeating the Smithson
Valley Rangers 11–5.
The team proved their ability to stay
composed while overcoming obstacles
under pressure. Winning is not just
about talent, skill, or the type of cleats
you wear. Winning is about character,
on and off the field, alongside hard
work and dedication to one’s team. The
Prosper Eagles showed their commit-
ment to these values from the very be-
ginning.
I know I speak on behalf of the entire
community when I say the city of
Prosper is beaming with pride.
I ask my colleagues to join me in
congratulating the Prosper High
School men’s lacrosse team on their
successful season.

CELEBRATING JUNETEENTH
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I
rise to join my friends and colleagues
in celebrating Juneteenth.
Madam Speaker, 154 years ago, on
June 19, 1865, Texas became the final
State in the U.S. to officially abolish
slavery. This was a pivotal day in
American history, one that represents
both the checkered past of our Nation
as well as the rising above it.
September 1862, President Abraham
Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proc-
lamation, and it took effect on Janu-
ary 1, 1863, throughout all the formerly
Confederate States.
Madam Speaker, 2 years later, Texas
was the last stop on the road to the
abolition of slavery in America on
June 19, known as Juneteenth.
On a day like Juneteenth, we encour-
age everyone to come together and cel-
ebrate this occasion and recognize not
what makes us different from one
other, but what we all have in com-
mon, all that we share: the love of free-
dom and individual rights that we are
one people.
There is still more to be done, but a
lot of progress has been made the last
150 years, and we will continue to make
that together as a society.
f
SEVEN FACTORS IMPEDING
IMPEACHMENT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. GREEN) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority
leader.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. It is a preeminent
privilege to stand here and address this
august body—to address those who are
within the sound of my voice would
probably be more appropriate—and
those who are onlookers by way of var-
ious means of telecommunications. It
is an honor and a privilege to do so,
and I am grateful to the leadership of
this House for extending and allowing
the privilege. I believe that it is one of
the great honors of being a
Congressperson, to be able to stand and
address the Nation, if you will.
So tonight, as a Member of this body,
it is my honor to speak on a topic very
near and dear to my heart and the
hearts of a good many Americans. I
would like to talk about some of the
current factors that are impeding im-
peachment.
I have mnemonic notes that I will
refer to from time to time so as to ad-
dress seven different topics that are
factors currently impeding impeach-
ment.
The first that I shall address is the
belief by many that not enough bipar-
tisanship exists as it relates to im-
peachment, not enough persons from
both sides of the aisle, and, more spe-
cifically, not enough persons who are
representative of the Republican
Party.
There is this belief that impeach-
ment must be an effort that is bipar-
tisan, and it must be to some signifi-
cant amount of bipartisanship. That
amount has not been announced, so it
is hard to say what the significant
amount of bipartisanship is that is
being sought.
But I think that at this point, so as
to address the question of bipartisan-
ship, which I believe in, would hope
for—I think that bipartisanship is a
wonderful thing. But to address it, I be-
lieve we will have to go to Federalist
65.
For those who are interested, the
Federalist Papers consists of some 85
articles that were published between
1787 and 1788, published by the first
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court,
John Jay. He was also assisted by the
first Secretary of the Treasury, Alex-
ander Hamilton. And, of course, the
third part of this group of persons was
Madison, the fourth President of the
United States.
These persons, the three of them, the
trio, were to, if you will, present rea-
sons to the country why the Constitu-
tion should be ratified; and in pre-
senting reasons for ratification, they
published Federalist 65.
Federalist 65 explains what impeach-
ment is all about. It does a little bit
more than just explains what it is
about. It explains what one might ex-
pect, what we might expect if impeach-
ment is sought.
And I must say, at this point, that
these three Framers of the Constitu-
tion were prophetic, absolutely persons
who could see into the future, one
might think, because they prognos-
ticated what we are having to concern
ourselves with currently in terms of
what will happen among the people and
in society should we move toward im-
peachment.
Prophetic—they had their flaws; they
were not perfect; but on this issue,
they seemed to have been prophetic,
because they prognosticated that at a
time such as this, there would be divi-
sion, that you would have parties sepa-
rating in their own corners, if you will,
that the people among us in society,
that they would have very hard opin-
ions; that people would sometimes base
their opinions upon the circumstances,
and others, just based upon the knowl-
edge that they might have of the per-
son who is being impeached.
They prognosticated that this would
not be a time of great unity, that it is
more likely to be a time of division.
And they knew, however, that the Con-
stitution could survive this.
The Constitution survived the im-
peachment of Andrew Johnson in 1868.
It was rancorous; there was a lot of di-
visiveness; but the Constitution sur-
vived. The Constitution is capable of
surviving it, and the people, more im-
portantly, are capable of surviving.
And society is capable of surviving,
which means the country can survive
impeachment.
But it is there for a reason. It is
there because there is a belief that,
from time to time, you may have one

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5000 June 20, 2019
holding public trust in the highest of-
fice of the land, the Chief Executive Of-
ficer, known as the President. The
Chief Executive Officer may engage in
conduct that would cause the trust in
the Chief Executive Officer to be as-
sumed less than what it should be.
The Chief Executive Officer might
breach his trust that the public has in
him. The Chief Executive Officer would
do harm to society, and in doing harm
to society, the Framers of the Con-
stitution concluded that there should
be a means by which the Chief Execu-
tive Officer could be removed, and this,
of course, would be impeachment.
Impeachment is not something that
anyone relishes. We don’t seek im-
peachment. It is sometimes forced
upon us, something that you have to do
if you truly believe that no one is
above the law.
Let’s look at some of the historic im-
peachment cases. There are but two:
Johnson in 1868, and Clinton in 1998.
And in both of these, the parties were
separated. There was not a moment
when the Republicans and Democrats
decided: Yes, this is what we must do,
and we will unite and get it done.
Andrew Johnson was not impeached,
and the impeachment failed by one
vote.
President Clinton was not im-
peached, but there was not this rush of
Democrats to support Republicans to
impeach President Clinton. It just
didn’t happen.
So an expectation of national unity
is probably setting the standard so
high that we may not ever impeach.
The Framers understood that there
might not be this unity, probably
wouldn’t be, and prognosticated that
unity would not exist in Federalist 65.
So we are setting the bar pretty high
when we decide this must be done.
By the way, no one can impose that
standard upon us. That is a standard
that we can accept, but it doesn’t have
to be a standard for the Members who
would vote for impeachment. That is
absolutely not the case. There is no
one person who can impose such a
standard on this body.
Each person has the opportunity to
make up his or her mind based upon
the evidence presented using the stand-
ard that he or she believes to be appro-
priate. So imposing a standard of na-
tional unity is probably setting the bar
a bit too high.
Next, there is this notion that we
should defeat, not impeach. Defeat, not
impeach.
Well, we say that no one is above the
law, and I have heard a good many
Members of this body say so. It has
been published: No one is above the
law.
And usually there would be the fol-
lowing words thereafter: No one is
above the law, and this includes the
President of the United States.
Well, if no one is above the law and
you believe that the President has
committed impeachable acts, then you
probably wouldn’t want to say that we
should defeat at the next election as
opposed to impeach now—if no one is
above the law. Because, in essence, you
are saying: No one is above the law;
however, I won’t enforce the law. I
won’t honor Article II of the Constitu-
tion. No one is above the law, but I am
not going to impose the law upon one
who has committed impeachable acts.
I don’t see the consistency in doing
this, but it is the prerogative of people
to do what they may. I am merely ex-
plaining some of the impediments to
impeachment. This is one: Defeat, not
impeach.
And if no one is above the law, as I
have indicated, and I believe this—and
this includes the President—then I be-
lieve we have a duty, a responsibility,
and an obligation to move forward with
impeachment. I don’t think you wait
until the next election to avoid your
duty, responsibility, and obligation.
One salient point that can be made is
some ugly things can happen when you
have no guardrails, when you send a
signal to the Chief Executive Officer
that there is no one to hold you ac-
countable, that the Congress is not
going to fulfill its responsibilities
under the Constitution—no guardrails.
Well, the Chief Executive Officer,
who has already committed impeach-
able actions, will proceed probably to
do what he may and will simply be-
cause he knows that he does not have
the deterrent that the Congress is sup-
posed to impose by virtue of having
this awesome amount of authority to
remove from him office—assuming that
the President is impeached and the
Senate convicts.
But, if you don’t have guardrails, you
don’t have a Chief Executive Officer
who is being deterred from doing
things that we might find totally inap-
propriate, for example, going to war.
The Chief Executive Officer could de-
cide: I need not go to Congress to go to
war. The Congress has the duty and re-
sponsibility to declare the war, but
since Congress isn’t going to do any-
thing, why bother?
Congress is but another entity, not a
coequal partner in the government
with the executive.
So I think you can’t hold the posi-
tion that you will defeat, not impeach,
especially when you have said, if you
have, that the President has com-
mitted these impeachable actions.
Now, there are a good many people
who are walking back comments. And
everybody has a right to walk back
comments—happens quite regularly
here—but you might take note of this:
You can’t walk back history. You can
walk back comments, but you can’t
walk back history.
So if you have already said that the
President has committed these im-
peachable actions and you have already
said the President should be im-
peached, you won’t be able to walk
that back from history.
Time tells and history judges. The
truth is known. The truth will be pub-
lished at some point about what we
have said and how we have behaved.
Impeachment cannot be but a talking
point to be used for political expedi-
ency. You can’t on one day say, ‘‘Oh,
yes, he ought to be impeached,’’ and
then the next day say something that
contradicts this in an effort to walk it
back.
Well, you can do it, but history will
record both of your comments, and his-
tory will judge you. At some point,
that judgment will be codified such
that the world will know what was said
on all occasions, not just on the latest
rendition of the commentary that is
made.
Time tells; history judges. The truth
will be known. Defeat, not impeach is
not an option if you believe that the
President has committed impeachable
actions.
b 1945
Then, there is, of course, the notion
that the Senate won’t convict. There is
no requirement that the Senate con-
vict. This is something that a person or
some persons can require of them-
selves, a belief that since the Senate
won’t convict, there is no need to im-
peach. But that is not what impeach-
ment is all about. It is about the House
of Representatives doing its job.
The House does its job quite rou-
tinely here sending bills of great im-
portance to the Senate that the Senate
doesn’t act on. It did so last week and
will do so again and again. H.R. 1 was
not acted on, and a good many others.
I need not go through all of them. But
the point is, you cannot conclude be-
cause it is impeachment that you have
a different standard, in my opinion.
You have to have one standard. Ei-
ther we are going to decide we will not
send things to the Senate, and cease
and desist, I suppose being the House of
Representatives, which I would not
abide with, but that, I suppose, would
be a decision that you might make, one
might make, but not one for me to
make.
I think that we have a responsibility
to do our jobs, and then we give the
Senate the opportunity to do its job. If
we do our job, we do more than simply
impeach, which is important. We act as
a deterrent that impeachment is to
deter the next President; to let the
next President know that the House of
Representatives will not shy away
from its responsibility; that it will do
what it is supposed to do when a Presi-
dent commits impeachable actions.
So this notion that the Senate won’t
act is a reason for us not to act, would
mean then that the Senate controls
impeachment, which is the responsi-
bility of the House of Representatives.
Do we want to give the Senate the
authority to do its will and not have
the House do its will? Do we want the
Senate’s will to become the will of the
House? What we are saying is, until we
can get a Senate that will follow our
lead, we will not take the lead and do
as we should, do what we, according to
Article II section 4, and in my opinion,
must.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5001
June 20, 2019
We cannot allow the Senate to con-
trol the House of Representatives no
more than we can allow another party,
if I am on one side of the aisle and we
have a party on the other side, we can’t
allow another party to dictate what we
would do on this side of the aisle.
If you have overwhelming majority,
you cannot blame the other side for
your failure to act. That is my opinion.
If we have an overwhelming majority,
then at some point, it will be noted in
history that we didn’t act. And it won’t
be said in history that we didn’t act be-
cause the minority prohibited us from
acting here in the House.
It won’t be said that we failed to act
because the Senate had the authority
to prevent us from acting. The Senate
does not trump the House of Represent-
atives. We cannot decide that only the
Senate can determine whether the
House should move forward. This is not
what the Framers intended. But this is,
in effect, what we will be doing if we
predicate our actions upon the actions
of the Senate.
I don’t think that is appropriate and
I take issue with the notion that we
must wait until the Senate is ready to
act before we can act.
By the way, no one knows what the
Senate would do until the Senate has
an opportunity to do it. Once the Sen-
ate is confronted with having to vote,
we may find that the Senate will take
a different course of conduct than that
we have presupposed the Senate will do
or take.
The Senate could very well have an
epiphanous moment. Probably not, but
it could, meaning some two-thirds of
it, and act. But whether it does or
doesn’t, we have a duty to do our job
and then let the Senate take a vote, go
on record, and we will let the chips fall
where they may in history.
I think all of us, we should all be on
record. We know what the cir-
cumstances are. We know the harm
that is being caused in society. We
know that the trust has been breached,
and we only have to now do what the
Framers have given us the way to do,
assuming that we have the will to do
it.
They gave us the way, but they could
not give us the will. We have to have
the will to act ourselves. Impeachment
in the Senate, where the trial is to
take place, is not to be predicated upon
the House following the will of the Sen-
ate.
Now, there is another reason that I
would like to call to your attention,
another impediment, and it is the no-
tion that impeachment will divide our
Nation. I have covered this to a limited
extent, but I will go back because some
things bear repeating.
In Federalist No. 65, the Framers of
the Constitution made it very clear
that you will not have, as they saw it
at that time, this national unity. It
doesn’t work that way. People are
going to take sides. And when they do,
you are likely to have things develop
along party lines. But we have to still
do our job. We cannot set standards
that may be impossible.
We can’t have the standard be the
Senate must decide it will go along
with us before we will act. That is not
a reasonable standard for us to have as
Members of the House. We are inde-
pendent. We can’t have the standard
that we can only do this if we have the
consent of the opposing party.
What you are doing is putting the
fate of the country in the hands of the
minority. You are putting the fate of
the country in the hands of the Senate
when the House has a duty to act.
So I conclude with this on this point,
the notion that it will divide the Na-
tion is something that was prognos-
ticated. Now, I would love to have the
country in unity. I believe in unity,
and I think you can have unity without
uniformity. We don’t all have to do the
same thing all the time to have unity
on certain issues.
But there is no constitutional re-
quirement that we have the minority
support what the majority can do, and
the Senate be aligned with the House
before the House can act. There is no
constitutional requirement for such a
thing.
Next, we have the notion that im-
peachment can benefit the Chief Exec-
utive Officer. Impeachment will benefit
the Chief Executive Officer. It is hard
to imagine a Chief Executive Officer
wanting to be impeached.
I have seen and heard statements
from the Chief Executive Officer that
would give me reason to believe that
the Chief Executive Officer really does
not want to be impeached.
There is something called reverse
psychology that we are all familiar
with. Say that you want the thing that
you don’t want, to the extent that you
convince the people who can have the
impact to do the thing that you do
want them to do, which is the thing
that they think you don’t want them
to do.
My point is simply this: We cannot
assume that we are walking into some
sort of petard, by virtue of our taking
up our constitutional responsibility.
This is not a trap. This is our responsi-
bility, and we should not allow a Chief
Executive Officer to convince us that
we should do this because the Chief Ex-
ecutive Officer thinks that it would
benefit him, when, in fact, the history
of impeachment seems to provide evi-
dence to the contrary.
The history of events is that Andrew
Johnson did not get reelected after he
was impeached.
And for those who have been in this
debate about what happened with
President Clinton, I assure you, his
Vice President did not get elected. One
would assume that the mantle would
be passed on to the Vice President.
Such was not the case. He was not
elected.
There are those who would say: Well,
but the House of Representatives—no,
the House didn’t change hands. The Re-
publicans maintained control of the
House of Representatives. Well, they
lost some seats. Well, they did, but
they still had 218 and they controlled
the House.
The point is, you cannot assume that
impeachment is going to be a benefit.
As a matter of fact, it is an indelible
stain on the record of the Chief Execu-
tive Officer. It would be forever known,
whether he is removed from office or
not, that this Chief Executive Officer
was impeached. It will have an impact
on the Chief Executive Officer’s brand.
This person will forever have the brand
of an impeached Chief Executive Offi-
cer.
I am not saying you do it just to
brand a person. I am talking about im-
peachment, because we would fulfill
the responsibilities under Article II
section 4, which indicate that the
President can be impeached for high
crimes and misdemeanors, bribery,
treason. We would fulfill those respon-
sibilities pursuant to Article II section
4.
In so doing, we would indelibly place
the brand of impeachment on the Chief
Executive Officer. Whether he is con-
victed and removed or not, he still suf-
fers eternally throughout all of time
the fact that impeachment was im-
posed upon him, which I think is an ap-
propriate remedy. Even if we don’t get
a conviction I think we should let the
world know that the House took up its
responsibility. The House of Represent-
atives did its job.
Of course, there is this notion now,
another standard, that you have to
have what I am calling a rock-solid
case. I hear commentary that would
lead me to believe that this has to be
done only when you have evidence be-
yond all doubt; not a reasonable doubt,
which is what we might have in court;
not by clear and convincing evidence;
clearly, not by the preponderance of
the evidence, which is a very low
standard, but beyond all doubt.
I am hearing persons speak such that
one could conclude that if you didn’t
see it yourself, whatever the impeach-
able act is, that we need more evi-
dence.
We have the Mueller report. We were
told, let’s wait for the Mueller report.
We waited for the Mueller report. And
then, well, we need to hear from Mr.
Mueller. Mr. Mueller has spoken and
has pretty much said: What you see is
what you will get. He may ratify what
is there, but it doesn’t appear, based
upon what I heard him say, that he will
be giving nuanced testimony above and
beyond what is contained in the report.
For those who want to hear from Mr.
Mueller, I wouldn’t get in the way of
that. Let’s have Mr. Mueller come and
testify. But the truth is, the report, in
and of itself, is evidence, because all of
the statements contained in the
Mueller report were taken from per-
sons who were giving their testimony
at the expense of committing perjury if
they didn’t give truthful statements.
So perjury was a consequence of giv-
ing an untruthful statement to the FBI

agents who were asking these ques-
tions. And the Mueller report is pretty
good evidence. We could use that to im-
peach if we chose to do so.
I believe that the Mueller report con-
tains some 10 opportunities for this
Congress to engage in impeachment,
bringing impeachment to the floor of
this House for a vote. And for edifi-
cation purposes, the President doesn’t
have to commit a crime to be im-
peached. We won that battle. That was
one of the first things that was said
when impeachment was called to the
attention of this body some more than
2 years ago. What crime has he com-
mitted?
Well, we know now that you don’t
have to commit a crime. We knew then
that you don’t have to commit a crime.
But it seems that there was an effort,
almost, among some to distort what
the law is for purposes that I cannot
announce. But there seems to have
been a desire to convince the public
that the President must commit a
crime to be impeached. That is not
true.
What is the evidence of it not being
true? The fact that Andrew Johnson
was impeached in article 10 of the Arti-
cles of Impeachment against him in
1868 for speaking ill of Congress, which
wasn’t a crime then, and isn’t a crime
now.
Speaking ill of Congress is not a
crime. He was impeached for speaking
ill of Congress in article 10 of the Arti-
cles of Impeachment against Andrew
Johnson. That is the best evidence,
what has happened.
b 2000
What has happened?
What we know to be the case. So
those who would like to change the
standard, you have got history to deal
with, Madam Speaker. If you want to
change the standard. To change the
standard, you would have to literally
erase what happened with Andrew
Johnson.
There is no requirement that the
President commit a crime to be im-
peached. He has to do harm to society.
He has to breach the public trust—
breach the public trust, cause harm to
society—and you can be impeached if
you are the Chief Executive Officer.
There is no requirement that you com-
mit a crime, no requirement that the
Senate has to agree with the House be-
fore the House can act, and no require-
ment that there must be a national
unity government before you can have
impeachment.
These are standards that are being
set that are, quite frankly, beyond the
rationale that the Framers of the Con-
stitution provided for us.
Read the Federalist Papers, Madam
Speaker, and you will get a better un-
derstanding. Federalist 65 would be a
good read. It is a short read, and you
will get a better understanding.
So these standards—these unreason-
able standards, in my opinion—are
such that we will probably end up en-
gaging in expediency and saying that
we want to impeach for the purpose of
expediency, but not making impeach-
ment an action item. It is one thing to
have political expediency, but another
thing to turn that into an action item.
The action item would have to be im-
peachment. You cannot just talk about
this with certainty and not act, Madam
Speaker.
The final thing that must be done
pursuant to the moral imperative to
act is to impeach. And I find that we
are talking about this to the extent
that we will do it eventually—if we are
not very careful of what Dr. King
called, engage in the paralysis of anal-
ysis—just analyze this and set stand-
ards. All standards keep changing from
time to time.
But remember this, no one can set
the standard for any one of us in the
House of Representatives. All 435 of us
have been given the standard of being a
Member of the House and making a de-
cision. I say this based upon what your
conscience dictates and based upon a
belief that Article II section 4 of the
Constitution has been violated.
Speaking of Article II section 4 and
the President not having to commit a
crime, it is important to note this:
high crimes and misdemeanors.
By the way, Madam Speaker, you can
be impeached for a high misdemeanor.
It doesn’t have to be a high crime and
misdemeanor. This is what a good
many persons are still saying. Not
true.
How do you know that you can be im-
peached for a high misdemeanor?
Because Andrew Johnson was im-
peached for a high misdemeanor. It
doesn’t have to be a high crime and
misdemeanor. It can simply be a mis-
demeanor. A misdemeanor, Madam
Speaker, can be a minor criminal of-
fense or it can be a misdeed. The word
‘‘misdemeanor’’ was defined at the
time the Framers wrote the Constitu-
tion, and to this day, as a misdeed. An-
drew Johnson was impeached for a high
misdeed in article 10 of the Articles of
Impeachment against him.
Make notes. Write that down. Read
it. Check. You will find the truth is
there for a misdeed, a high misdeed, a
high misdemeanor, and a misdemeanor
is a misdeed.
Let’s debunk the notion that im-
peachment will benefit the President.
It has been debunked. The notion that
you have to have a rock-solid case,
there is no such thing as a rock-solid
case or maybe some other term simi-
lar. There is no requirement.
The notion that impeachment is not
political, well, that is not what the
Framers of the Constitution said. That
is not what is said in Federalist 65.
Read Federalist 65. There is no require-
ment that you avoid politics. The
Framers used that very word, ‘‘polit-
ical’’, in Federalist 65. So the notion
that impeachment can’t be political is
contrary to what the people who wrote
the Constitution thought should be
contained therein.
What is interesting to me is that we
have a good many people here who be-
lieve in the intent of the law.
What was the intent?
I am starting to think that it is for
convenience some of the time. Either
you are for intent or you are not,
Madam Speaker. Well, the intent of the
Framers was that this would be polit-
ical, and it is going to be political. You
are not going to escape the politics of
it with clever phrases. It is not going
to happen. This is political the notion
that you have to have a rock-solid
case. That is beyond what is expected
from the Framers. And I am not sure
you are going to ever finish your inves-
tigation if you are going to continue to
investigate until you have exhausted
every possible thing before you move
forward, and nobody can set that
standard for the 435 Members of this
House.
Next, we have the question of bigotry
in policy. There are some who believe
that it is okay to have bigotry inten-
tionally placed in policy. Bigotry in
policy, to decide that you are going to
do something that will be bigoted as
the Chief Executive Officer and you
will put that into policy, to decide you
are going to ban certain people from
the country, to decide that you are
going to change the rules because peo-
ple may be from what might be called
a s-hole country, change the rules for
those from that s-hole country. And
then to give some indication that you
have bigotry within you by announcing
that people who would say phrases
like, ‘‘blood and soil’’, ‘‘Jews will not
replace us’’, protesting out in the
street, calling themselves members of
groups that have been known infa-
mously for behaving in invidious dis-
crimination, give us all of the evidence
that we need. I guarantee you that big-
otry in policy is impeachable.
I assure you of this: I believe in the
deepest corners of my soul that if a
previous President said and did the
things that the Chief Executive Officer
has said and done, he would be im-
peached. He would be removed from of-
fice. And I would be one of the persons
to support it. We cannot have double
standards.
Madam Speaker, you can’t have a
standard that exists because you have
a beneficial bigot, a bigot that serves a
useful purpose, a bigot that benefits
your agenda. All of your adult life you
have been preaching against certain
things, and then you get a beneficial
bigot, someone that might do some-
thing such as, appoint persons to the
court that you would like to have, and
then your standards change. You ac-
cept bigotry in policy against people
that I would call the least, the last,
and the lost.
You would accept it against these ba-
bies, Madam Speaker. You would ac-
cept, accept, accept having a 4-month-
old baby separated from his parents. At
4 months old, taken out of the arms of
his father. And some time thereafter,
when the father is trying to gain cus-
tody of his child, say to the father that

we will have to deport you, when you
take your seat on the plane, we will
bring your child to you. We will give
you the child back.
This is the United States of America
I am talking about. I love my country.
I don’t love that kind of behavior. I
have great disdain for that level of be-
havior. Tell this man he is going to get
his child, and then have him deported
without his baby. This was reported
some 2, 3 days ago in a reputable news
source—separated. We know babies are
being separated or have been separated.
This is supposed to be the youngest, 4
months old. Later on you take the 4-
month-old to court, you have a hear-
ing. The baby is now with some people
who are taking care of the baby. And
then you finally decide the baby is now
6 months of age or there about and you
will return this baby to his parents.
They have suffered greatly.
Can you imagine, someone taking
your 4-month-old baby?
Can you imagine the pain, the sleep-
less nights, and the crying?
Can you imagine how your life would
just be torn apart?
Your baby has been removed. Well,
you finally get your baby back. One
would assume that this would be a joy-
ous occasion, but the baby doesn’t rec-
ognize the parents.
Imagine the pain of reaching out to
your baby, Madam Speaker, and your
baby withdraws and turns to someone
else, because a government had a pol-
icy of deterring people from coming by
separating babies as young as 4 months
old from parents.
I just don’t abide with this. I cannot
accept this. Those who can are a better
person than I am. They are. It really
does not matter what happens to me.
The story of the Good Samaritan is not
the story of the person who said: If I
cross over and help this person, what is
going to happen to me?
The story of the Good Samaritan is
the story of the person who said: If I
don’t help this person, what is going to
happen to him?
We use that parable quite a bit in
this country.
The story of the person who is the
brother’s keeper is the story of a per-
son who said: Am I my brother’s keep-
er?
Well, we know this: you can’t be your
brother’s keeper without keeping your
brother. Brothers and sisters are our
relatives. Distant though they may be,
they are a part of humanity. They are
ours. We belong to them, and they be-
long to us.
This kind of behavior is unaccept-
able. I have said before, and I will say
again and again, if these babies were
coming across the northern border we
would have a different mindset. We
would not have the mindset that we
have now such that we put them in
cages.
I went to the border. I wanted to see
for myself, and I saw babies lying on a
cement floor with some sort of tinfoil
blanket over them in conditions that
the SPCA would not allow animals to
exist in.
If it doesn’t touch your heart,
Madam Speaker, you are a better per-
son than I am, because it touched my
heart. When I saw it, it hurt. This is
about humanity. This is about persons
fleeing harm’s way. This is about a law
that allows them to approach one of
our agents, make a proper announce-
ment, and get a fair hearing.
It is not about circumventing the
law, trying to find clever ways to keep
people out who are following the law.
It is not about that. It is about people.
It is about humanity. It is about the
greatest country in the world and what
people around the world think of us
now.
I assure you, Madam Speaker, the
image that we had is being tarnished, I
won’t say irreparably, but I will say it
is being tarnished.
The lady with the golden lamp, or
light, if you will, torch, give me your
poor, you know the rest of the story,
your tired, you know the rest of it. We
have honored that. We took about 11
million people, I believe, from Europe.
We didn’t separate babies from moth-
ers. We welcomed them.
Something has changed. Something
has changed. We are witnessing before
our very eyes a change in the culture
and a change in our country, because
we are witnessing before our very eyes
that we seem to think that it is okay
or that it is not something that we
ought to address.
The President doesn’t have to com-
mit a crime, the Chief Executive Offi-
cer doesn’t have to commit a crime to
be impeached. We but have to have the
will to do what we must, in my opin-
ion.
By the way, my opinion is that we
are more likely to impeach than not.
This is my opinion. I really do believe
that in this House there will be people
who are going to conclude that they
will not tolerate the level of injustice
being perpetrated.
b 2015
I believe it. I believe that there will
be a majority to do it, more likely than
not. I believe that it can and will hap-
pen. I really do.
I think that we should be delibera-
tive, but I don’t think that we should
allow the paralysis of analysis to pre-
vent us from doing our job.
I believe there will be enough people
who are going to come forward to say
we will hold the Chief Executive ac-
countable for this behavior and other
behavior: the whole notion that the
Chief Executive can tell members of
the constabulary, the police, that when
they arrest people and they have them
within their care, custody, and control,
that they don’t have to be nice to
them; and the whole notion that the
Chief Executive can ban people, that he
can send out a tweet and kick people
out of the military who have been serv-
ing honorably or prevent people from
coming in because of who they are.
I believe that there are enough peo-
ple who will find this offensive and
that they will take the action that the
Framers of the Constitution fully in-
tended we take.
I close with this, a belief that we
have been given an awesome responsi-
bility. We were elected to the people’s
House. We were elected to do the work
of the people, but we were also elected
to do the morally righteous thing.
There are some times when we have
to step beyond where the people may
be at a given time because we know
what is right and we are going to do
the righteous thing. Sometimes, we
have to do this. We just have to step
out.
We don’t take a poll, by the way.
This whole notion that, until the coun-
try is with us, we can’t do that which
the law requires us to do, in my opin-
ion, that whole notion that we can’t do
it until the country is with us, well,
that is taking a poll.
A poll is a snapshot in time. That is
all it is, just a snapshot in time. Are
we going to allow something as nec-
essary as impeachment to be governed
by a poll?
I thank God that Dr. King and those
who crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge
did not do so based upon a poll, that
they had huddled and said, ‘‘Well, Dr.
King, what do the polls say?’’
If it is a righteous cause, the polls
don’t matter. We have to do that which
is right, be led by the spirit sometimes,
as a friend said to me, to do the right
thing.
Polls. What if Rosa Parks had taken
a poll? ‘‘Let’s take a poll before you
take that seat on the bus, risking ev-
erything.’’ She had no idea what her
fate would be.
‘‘Take a poll, Rosa.’’ Would she have
taken the seat if she had relied on
polls?
What if Lincoln had said, ‘‘Let’s take
a poll before we attempt to pass the
13th Amendment.’’
Polls can prevent us from doing that
which is bold. Bold actions are not
predicated upon a poll. They are predi-
cated upon the righteousness of the
cause. If the cause is righteous, we
ought to do the right thing.
Dr. King said the time is always
right to do what is right.
I believe that we need not take polls,
that we have enough evidence, that we
shouldn’t have unreasonable standards,
and that this House can and will do its
job.
I say ‘‘more likely than not’’ simply
because anything is possible, I suppose.
But I just believe that there are
enough people here of goodwill who are
going to decide that what we have seen
is enough before we end up seeing
something that we cannot reverse,
something that could be beyond what
we would want to see happen, not only
to this country but to all countries, by
way of what happens to one directly
happens to all indirectly, according to
Dr. King, because life is an inescapable
network of mutuality.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5004 June 20, 2019
I don’t want to see something hap-
pen, but I do want to say this: Given
that we know we can impeach right
now, if we fail to impeach and some
dastardly thing occurs, there will be
Members of this House who will regret
not having taken the appropriate ac-
tion.
It is bigger than any one of us. This
is about humanity. We ought to respect
the means by which we can preserve in-
tegrity, the means by which we can
preserve the lives that we have been
charged with the responsibility of car-
ing for as Members of this body.
Let us move forward.
I greatly appreciate the leadership
for giving me this opportunity to be
heard.
My dear friends, unless leadership
changes the rules, I will be heard again
because I plan to come back again and
again. I assure my colleagues that if no
one else does, there will be another
vote on impeachment on the floor of
the House of Representatives, not be-
cause I want to do it but because I be-
lieve I am forced to do it. I have little
choice if I want to protect the integ-
rity of the Constitution and preserve
the notion of no person being above the
law.
I believe I have a responsibility to do
it. I don’t like using the personal pro-
noun ‘‘I’’ as it relates to this, but I
have no choice. It will be done. We will
all go on RECORD.
I assure my colleagues, I will not ap-
proach any individual person to try to
convince a person that he or she should
do a given thing. I will talk from this
podium, as I have, and I will answer
those who may ask me questions. But I
do believe we have to take this duty se-
riously, and we have to have a vote in
the House of Representatives.
I am thankful for the time, Madam
Speaker, and I greatly appreciate the
opportunity to be a Member of this au-
gust body. While I am here, I plan to do
all that I can to make sure, for the peo-
ple I have been elected to serve, that I
do what is in their best interests, even
if they may not think it is in their best
interests.
There are some things that are big-
ger than individuals. It is about a
country. It is about humanity.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
HONORING HIS EMINENCE
ARCHBISHOP ELPIDOPHOROS
(Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in honor of His Eminence
Archbishop Elpidophoros, who was re-
cently elected the new Greek Orthodox
Archbishop of America.
Archbishop Elpidophoros was born in
Constantinople, Istanbul, Turkey, in
1967. Since August 2011, he has served
as the abbot of the Patriarchal Mon-
astery of Holy Trinity in Halki, where
I had an opportunity to meet him this
past April. What a wonderful, wonder-
ful person.
Madam Speaker, our beloved semi-
nary is located there as well.
He is an expert theologian. I was so
blessed to have a conversation with
him. He is kind and honorable. We
could hope for no better qualities in
our new archbishop.
He replaces Archbishop Demetrios,
who has retired after 20 years at his
post.
Archbishop Elpidophoros leads a
church of more than 11⁄2 million Greek
Orthodox Christians in the United
States, promoting the values of ortho-
doxy at every opportunity.
I wish Archbishop Elpidophoros the
best in all of his endeavors and con-
gratulate him on this great achieve-
ment. May God’s grace be upon him in
his new role.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4132 June 20, 2019
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask
to speak as in morning business for 1
minute.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
‘‘THIS IS IOWA’’ CAMPAIGN
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Gov.
Kim Reynolds of my State of Iowa has
unveiled what she calls the ‘‘This is
Iowa’’ campaign. That campaign has
encouraged people to choose Iowa to
live and work.
Iowa has the second lowest unem-
ployment rate in the Nation. As I trav-
el Iowa with my county meetings, I
hear from employers across Iowa that
have high-paying skilled jobs they can-
not fill. That is why Iowa was ranked
the No. 1 State to find a job in 2019.
The cost of living is low and the qual-
ity of life is second to none. Check out
thisisiowa.com to learn more. In the
words of Meredith Wilson, of ‘‘76 Trom-
bones’’ fame, from Mason City, IA:
‘‘You really ought to give Iowa a try.’’
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday, by a wide bipartisan margin,
the Senate began considering this
year’s National Defense Authorization
Act.
The Senate has passed an NDAA each
of the last 58 years. We authorize the
resources, the equipment, the support
systems, and the pay that keep our All-
Volunteer Force the strongest in the
world.
From the outside, this process may
look routine, but as our colleagues on
the Armed Services Committee know
best, keeping America safe takes con-
stant hard work and innovation.
We have all seen the recent head-
lines: ‘‘Russia ‘successfully tests’
hypersonic intercept missile that can
shoot down Western weapons,’’ ‘‘Chi-
na’s Military Technology Now Close to
Parity With U.S.’’
In just the last few hours, Iran shot
down an American surveillance aircraft
in international airspace over the
Strait of Hormuz. Fortunately, the air-
craft was unmanned.
Let me say that again. Last night,
the Iranians shot down a U.S. aircraft
in international airspace.
It could certainly not be clearer that
we need to keep modernizing our na-
tional defense, continue rebuilding our
readiness, and persist with our new na-
tional defense strategy.
Fortunately, this legislation includes
billions of dollars for modernizing our
capabilities, restoring the Navy’s fleet
strength, and investing in the latest
generation of combat aircraft. There
are billions more for critical research
weapons aimed at keeping U.S. weap-
ons systems on the cutting edge and
ensuring American servicemembers
never enter a fair fight. It prioritizes
greater efficiency and transparency at
the Pentagon so we can better support
military families through the sac-
rifices of service.
Again, I would like to thank Chair-
man INHOFE and Ranking Member JACK
REED for guiding the committee proc-
ess. I hope the Senate can work
through this legislation swiftly and
give it the overwhelming bipartisan
vote it deserves.
ARMS SALES
Mr. President, on a related matter, in
addition to completing the NDAA, the
Senate will today have to dispense
with several more privileged resolu-
tions concerning arms sales to close
American partners in a troubled but
important region.
These close partners deserve our sup-
port. I am glad we secured a bipartisan
understanding yesterday to expedite
their consideration so the 22 separate
resolutions which Members have intro-
duced will not jeopardize the Defense
bill or the emergency border funding
we must also consider next week.
Today this body, yet again, will de-
bate and cast votes concerning our re-
lationship with Saudi Arabia, just like
we did in March and December and the
previous March.
I think the vast majority of Senators
share serious concerns over some of the
policies and actions of our Saudi part-
ners, but rejecting long-planned arms
sales strikes me as an overly blunt tool
with several unintended consequences.
For example, the arms sales affected
by this vote are not just for Saudi Ara-
bia but also for the United Arab Emir-
ates, and they include sales that affect
Israel, India, Korea, and Jordan.
Last December, the Senate passed a
nuanced resolution that delivered ex-
actly the message we wanted to de-
liver: our fury over the murder of
Jamal Khashoggi, our concerns about
the war in Yemen, and our desire for
more accountability. That was the
right approach.
There is no shortage of tools avail-
able to the United States that are more
appropriate to communicate frustra-
tions and urge better behavior, wheth-
er from the administration or our part-
ners.
Senators could meet with Saudi offi-
cials to directly express their concerns.
They could travel to the region to see
firsthand complicated, fluid situations.
Rapid societal and economic change
is providing Saudi citizens with un-
precedented political openness but also
troubling human rights concerns and
erratic policy decisions. The dynamics
at play are not black and white.
We can best shape these dynamics by
working closely with our partners to
encourage them in the right direction,
rather than turning our back.
Concerned Members might also begin
giving fairer treatment and more
prompt consideration to the well-quali-
fied experts who are waiting to con-
tribute to our diplomacy. Recall that
the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Near Eastern Affairs just started his
job last Monday after he had been held
up for more than a year. The top State
Department job in the Middle East was
held open for more than a year.
The nominees for Ambassador to the
UAE, Egypt, and Libya are having
hearings today. I hope their confirma-
tions will move more quickly than
those of other senior diplomats who
languished for months.
So there is no shortage of productive
steps at Members’ disposal, but reck-
lessly canceling U.S. arms sales to key
regional partners is not on the list.
So the question the Senate will soon
consider is really this: whether we will
lash out at an imperfect partner and
undercut our own efforts to build co-
operation, check Iran, and achieve
other important goals or whether we
will keep our imperfect partners close
and use our influence; whether we will
push Riyadh and Abu Dhabi away from
the United States and push them closer
to Moscow and Beijing or whether we
will stay engaged and help our partners
course-correct where we can; whether
to signal at this hour of tension that
we cannot be relied upon to stand with
our friends, sending a message that
will embolden Tehran, or whether to
find more private, effective ways of en-
couraging better behavior while send-
ing a message of solidarity in troubled
times.
The situation in the Middle East, as
we speak, could hardly be more
fraught. The timing could not be worse
for the Senate to send the wrong sig-
nal.
In just the last several hours, we
have seen reports that a missile from
inside Yemen has struck a utility plant
in Saudi Arabia. This is after other at-
tacks—almost certainly from the Iran-
backed Houthi forces—on Saudi Arabia
and the UAE, including attacks on ci-
vilian vessels and on a civilian airport.
Again, just last night, Iran shot down
a U.S. intelligence aircraft that was
flying in international airspace. So the
Senate could hardly pick a worse time
for clumsy and ill-considered resolu-
tions that would hurt key relationships
in the Middle East.
Let’s not cut ourselves off from our
partners. Let’s not undercut the ad-
ministration at a time of such delicate
diplomacy and tension with Iran. So I
ask my colleagues to vote down these
resolutions.
NOMINATION OF KELLY KNIGHT CRAFT
Mr. President, on another matter, I
had the opportunity to introduce a
skillful leader and fellow Kentuckian
before the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee only just yesterday. Kelly
Knight Craft was confirmed by voice
vote in 2017 to serve as the U.S. Ambas-
sador to Canada. Now she is the Presi-
dent’s choice to serve as Ambassador
to the United Nations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4133
June 20, 2019
Ambassador Craft’s success in rep-
resenting American interests in Can-
ada certainly rewarded the Senate’s
vote of confidence. During a dynamic
and sometimes challenging period in
the U.S.-Canada friendship, she has
navigated it with care. She has helped
to shepherd the USMCA. She has
helped to secure cooperation on sanc-
tioning Russia for its aggression
against Ukraine and on pursuing de-
mocracy for Venezuela. She has spoken
out forcefully, when necessary, against
China.
Not surprisingly, this talented dip-
lomat has earned great respect both at
home and abroad.
The Premier of Ontario has said:
Every premier I know thinks the world of
her. . . . She really proved herself over some
tough times.
The former Deputy to Ambassador
Nikki Haley has described Ambassador
Craft as a worthy successor—‘‘smart,
capable, and knowledgeable about the
foreign policy challenges facing our
country.’’
This body confirmed Ambassador
Craft to her current post by voice vote.
Since then, she has only gained even
more experience, further refined her
expertise, and demonstrated her talent
even more clearly. Her testimony yes-
terday reinforced these things even fur-
ther.
President Trump has made an excel-
lent selection to serve our Nation in
this critical role at the U.N. She de-
serves bipartisan support from the For-
eign Relations Committee and, when
the time comes, a swift confirmation
here on the Senate floor.
BORDER SECURITY
Mr. President, on a final matter, for
nearly 2 months, my Republican col-
leagues and I have come to the floor
constantly to raise the alarm on the
humanitarian crisis down at the bor-
der. Record numbers of migrants have
pressed upon the U.S.-Mexico border,
including never-before-seen numbers of
families and unaccompanied children.
The agencies that care for these indi-
viduals and the facilities that house
them have been stretched dangerously
thin.
We all know this. That is why the ad-
ministration requested supplemental
funds 7 weeks ago. It is why agency
heads and law enforcement officials
have literally begged Congress to act.
Yet, until yesterday, we had not seen
progress, which leads one to ask why.
It is because—stop me if this sounds fa-
miliar—the Democratic House of Rep-
resentatives has been more interested
in denying this White House whatever
it asks for, however necessary it might
be, simply because it has been this
White House that has been asking for
it.
My friend the Democratic leader has
acknowledged publicly it has been the
Democratic-controlled House that has
been the hurdle. One House Democrat
from a border State has likewise ad-
mitted that it has been the left flank of
his own conference that has been the
stumbling block.
As the press has noted, some leading
Democrats have let partisanship so
cloud their judgment that they have
actually called the humanitarian prob-
lem a manufactured crisis or an artifi-
cial crisis. Really?
Well, these 7 weeks of wasted time
have made two things abundantly
clear—that partisanship doesn’t change
the facts and that ‘‘the resistance’’
doesn’t pay the bills. The House Demo-
crats have failed to get their act to-
gether, so now the Senate is going to
move forward.
Yesterday, thanks to the leadership
of Chairman SHELBY and Senator
LEAHY, the Appropriations Committee
approved a significant funding measure
by an overwhelming vote of 30 to 1—
just the kind of big, bipartisan vote we
ought to see in this particular situa-
tion for noncontroversial funding for
necessary programs to mitigate a na-
tional crisis.
The Republicans have been urging
this kind of consensus literally for
weeks, and now the Senate is finally
rising to the occasion. We need to vote
on this legislation before we recess at
the end of the month.
The Senate should not let even more
time slip by without addressing this
crisis head-on, and if we receive the
same kind of bipartisan cooperation
that was signaled in the committee
vote yesterday, we will not have to.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The

IRAN
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
over the past few months, tensions
with Iran have escalated. There have
been a series of attacks on tankers in
the Gulf region, and this morning it
was reported that Iran has shot down a
U.S. drone.
These events are deeply concerning—
all the more so because the Trump ad-
ministration has not explained to Con-
gress or to the American people how it
views these events, how it plans to re-
spond, and, most importantly, what
the broader strategy for confronting
Iran is.
President Trump left the diplomatic
agreement a little more than a year
ago. It was obvious to anyone who even
had a cursory knowledge of Iran that it
would create consequences. With that
decision, there is a course set for con-
flict—conflict whose purpose or strat-
egy has never been articulated to the
American people.
The President says on TV: It is a
much better Iran than when I took of-
fice. Well, they were not building nu-
clear weapons—and I opposed the Iran
agreement, as you know. But they were
not building nuclear weapons. They
were proceeding along the path of the
agreement, and the President, as he
seems to, just gets a bug in his head,
something he said in the campaign
without thinking, and then upends for-
eign policy—another example of chaos
in this administration. But he has done
that. He has done that.
So now the issue is what is our strat-
egy to deal with the consequences? The
American people have to know this. We
have seen too many conflicts in the
Middle East escalate into war—esca-
late into a 10-year war.
The American people are not for
spending a fortune and, more impor-
tantly, lives of Americans overseas.
They want us to focus here at home,
but the kind of adventurism—almost
unplanned, unthought out, and, cer-
tainly, unexplained adventurism—of
the President is the wrong way to go
and could lead to severe consequences.
And, I must say, even in closed-door
briefings with Senators, the adminis-
tration doesn’t have a strategy.
This is not how democracy is sup-
posed to work. This is not how the CEO
of a major Nation or even a major com-
pany should behave, with no articu-
lated strategy. The President needs to
explain to the American people why he
is driving us toward another endless
conflict in the Middle East.
SAUDI ARABIA
Madam President, on Saudi Arabia,
another matter concerning the admin-
istration’s foreign policy, today the
Senate will vote on resolutions of dis-
approval for arms sales to the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
These 22 resolutions introduced by
Senator MENENDEZ would block billions
of dollars in military sales, including
the transfer of tens of thousands of pre-
cision-guided munitions that the
Saudis have previously used to bomb
innocent civilians in Yemen.
The timing of these votes is signifi-
cant. Last night the United Nations
issued a report that documented evi-
dence that the Saudis meticulously
planned the murder of Jamal
Khashoggi and ‘‘forensically’’—their
words—disposed of the evidence.
According to the report, the Saudis
referred to Mr. Khashoggi as a sacrifi-
cial animal and that dismembering the
body would be easy—how gross, how
cruel, how beyond words.
Are we going to blithely go along and
let the Saudis continue? They are an
ally. Everyone knows that. That
doesn’t mean you let allies do the most
horrible things and just treat it as if
nothing happened. But in the wake of
such monstrosity, the Trump adminis-
tration is proposing another round of
billions of dollars in arms sales to
Saudi Arabia.
Well, we should at least have a de-
bate about whether that is the right
course of action. Leader MCCONNELL
was on the floor saying: What are the
Democrats doing here? We are debat-
ing, Mr. Leader. You have one view; I

may have another. But the American
people are entitled to a debate on this
important issue, and that is what the
law provides, and that is the tool we
use—one of the few tools we have to ac-
tually cause debate in this Chamber,
which the leader, with his legislative
graveyard, has assiduously avoided.
With his reducing the amount of time
that we can talk about and vet nomi-
nees, he has assiduously avoided that,
turning this Chamber into a graveyard
that the American people despise. But
here we have an opportunity to debate,
and even here the leader seems to be
decrying that fact, in my view.
The administration is claiming emer-
gency power and trying to circumvent
congressional review of these arms
sales. That premise must be rejected. It
sets a dangerous precedent for congres-
sional oversight of future arms sales,
and it can lead to renewed conflicts.
We are also discussing that, par-
enthetically, in relation to Iran.
Should Congress have some say there?
You will hear more from me later on
that.
The very least Congress can do is to
debate the merits of sending Saudi
Arabia billions of dollars in military
technology it may use not to confront
Iran but to perpetrate one of the larg-
est humanitarian catastrophes of its
generation.
Saudi Arabia, even though it be an
ally, must be held accountable for its
human rights abuses in Yemen and the
grotesque murder of Jamal Khashoggi.
HARRIET TUBMAN
Madam President, now, on the Tub-
man issue, more than 3 years ago then-
Treasury Secretary Jack Lew an-
nounced that he had ordered an accel-
erated redesign of the $20 bill with a
new design to feature Harriet Tub-
man’s portrait on the face of the bill.
The design was set to be released in
2020, the 100th anniversary of women
getting the right to vote—a fitting
tribute to an extraordinary American
and an extraordinary New Yorker.
There are no women or people of
color on our paper currency today,
even though they make up a signifi-
cant majority of our population. There
haven’t been for more than a century.
The plan to put Harriet Tubman on the
$20 note was a long overdue way to rec-
ognize that disparity and rectify it.
But shortly after the Trump adminis-
tration took office, all mention of the
Tubman $20 bill was deleted from the
Treasury Department’s website with-
out any explanation. Then, Secretary
Mnuchin testified that a decision had
been made to delay the release of the
$20 note until 2028, and Treasury re-
fused to confirm that Harriet Tub-
man’s image would ever appear on it.
The official word from the White
House was that the delay was required
to accommodate anti-counterfeiting
measures. But if you believe that, I
have a bridge that I can sell you. It is
simply not credible that with all the
resources of the Treasury Department,
a decade or more would be required to
produce a $20 bill.
A century ago, New Yorkers built the
Empire State building in a little over a
year. We landed a man on the Moon in
what seems to be less time. Surely the
21st century Treasury Department can
redesign a bill in a reasonable period of
time. The questions as to why the
White House, the Treasury, and maybe
even the President delayed this are
looming and real, given the President’s
attitude toward women and minorities.
I have asked the Department of
Treasury inspector general to launch
an investigation into the cir-
cumstances surrounding the Treasury’s
decision. The official reasons given
aren’t credible. The whole thing
smacks of politics. President Trump
has referred to efforts to replace An-
drew Jackson on the $20 bill as pure po-
litical correctness. To recognize more
than half the people in our society, to
recognize more than 25 percent of
Americans who are people of color, all
of whom have worked so hard to strive
for this great country—is that political
correctness? What is wrong with this
President? What is wrong with this
President, and what instincts is he ap-
pealing to? What bad instincts is he ap-
pealing to? It seems to be his practice,
his way, his MO.
So among the questions the inspector
general should examine is what role
President Trump played in this appar-
ent effort to renege on Treasury’s 2016
commitment to honor Harriet Tubman.
Whatever the President’s sentiments
toward Jackson are, there is no reason
to reverse the original Treasury De-
partment decision to recognize Harriet
Tubman’s historic legacy on the $20
bill, which would still feature our sev-
enth President on the reverse side.
I hope the inspector general will get
to the bottom of this, but in the mean-
time, I hope President Trump himself
is asked to answer for these delays. It
would truly be a sordid state of affairs
if the President or his team, for polit-
ical reasons, interfered with and in-
fected the process for designing Amer-
ican currency.
BACKGROUND CHECKS
Madam President, now, finally, on
background checks, in the early hours
on Monday, a heavily armed man ap-
proached the Federal building in down-
town Dallas and started shooting. This
was a civilian walking into the middle
of an American city with military-
grade weapons, a mask, and body
armor, and he was prepared to inflict
the maximum level of damage possible.
It is to the credit of the incredible
first responders that this accident did
not result in the loss of innocent life,
but it is remarkable that events like
this now seem all too routine, and so
the news cycle barely covers them be-
fore moving on.
Barely a week goes by without an in-
cident like this somewhere in America.
We are the only Nation in the devel-
oped world where these kinds of
things—these horrible things—happen
with regularity. Virginia Beach, High-
land Ranch, Poway, and Aurora, IL, are
all examples of shootings that have
taken place this year alone.
Later today, I will join several of my
colleagues from the House and the Sen-
ate, including our former colleague,
the great Gabby Giffords, to urge Lead-
er MCCONNELL to bring background
check legislation to the floor of the
Senate. It has been 114 days since the
House passed the measure, which more
than 90 percent of Americans support,
including more than 80 percent of Re-
publicans and the majority of gun own-
ers. But it seems that Leader MCCON-
NELL has set aside another plot in his
legislative graveyard for this poten-
tially lifesaving bill.
For too long, the gun lobby has re-
flexively opposed gun safety reforms,
even the most obvious and non-
controversial reforms, like closing
loopholes in background checks, and,
for too long, the Republican majority
has marched in lockstep with them.
The American people demand we do
these rational acts. The House has
passed it overwhelmingly with a bipar-
tisan vote. Where are Republicans? Are
they still cowering before the NRA? I
remind them, the NRA is a lot weaker
today than it was a few years ago. It is
time to do the right thing and stop
being scared.
Let’s move this bill to the floor. Let
Leader MCCONNELL finally let us de-
bate an issue long overdue.
ELECTION SECURITY
Madam President, finally, as we con-
tinue to debate the NDAA, I urge Lead-
er MCCONNELL once again to allow and
support amendments to protect our
elections from future attacks.
Election security is a national secu-
rity issue of the highest urgency. There
aren’t two sides to this debate. No one
can defend doing nothing as the Rus-
sians, and maybe the Chinese, the Ira-
nians, and the North Koreans, mess
with the wellspring of our democracy—
our elections.
As we have seen time and again from
reports by the FBI, intelligence agen-
cies, and the Mueller report, our elec-
tions came under attack from Russia
in the last Presidential election. FBI
Director Wray has warned that they
are coming for us again, and he thinks
it could be worse than in 2016.
Leader MCCONNELL will not deny
that this is true. So what are we wait-
ing for? We know the threat is there.
We know we can take steps to mini-
mize it. So why won’t Leader MCCON-
NELL let us act?
We have several options for legisla-
tive action, many of them bipartisan.
People on both sides of the aisle—
Democrats and Republicans—care
about this issue and have worked on
legislation together, something not
done frequently enough around here,
and Leader MCCONNELL just sits on
these bills.
Last week, Senator WARNER asked
unanimous consent to simply say the
FBI should be informed when a foreign
power tries to influence an election. I
believe Senator BLUMENTHAL will try

to do the same thing today. Is Leader
MCCONNELL going to instruct one of his
Republicans to block it again? Will he
have the courage to block it himself if
he wants it blocked?
The logical solution is to let us de-
bate the bills. If Leader MCCONNELL
will not cooperate on this matter,
Democrats are going to stand up for
our democracy on our own, if we have
to. We are going to ask unanimous con-
sent to allow debate on these bills. We
will insist on amendments to the
NDAA. Leader MCCONNELL has sug-
gested he wants an open amendment
process, so let’s press the matter, and
we will continue to push for more elec-
tion security funding as part of a deal
on budget caps.
There are not two sides on this one;
there are just not. There is only one
right answer: action to safeguard our
election. I urge Leader MCCONNELL to
let us move on this issue. Stop stalling,
stop obstructing. The legislative grave-
yard is full enough as it is. Let’s come
together, Democrats and Republicans,
to protect our grand, imperiled democ-
racy.
I yield the floor.

jority whip.
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, we
have begun consideration of this year’s
National Defense Authorization Act,
which is annual legislation to author-
ize funding for our military and na-
tional defense.
Like last year’s bill, this year’s Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act em-
phasizes military modernization and
readiness and the need to ensure that
we are prepared to counter threats
from great powers like China and Rus-
sia, as well as terrorists and rogue
states.
I am offering a handful of amend-
ments to this legislation, including an
amendment to address training oppor-
tunities for our Nation’s military pi-
lots and aircrews.
In my home State of South Dakota,
we are privileged to play host to Ells-
worth Air Force Base, home of two B–
1 bomb squadrons of the 28th Bomb
Wing, the airmen who are the backbone
of operations, as well as the 89th At-
tack Squadron and its control stations
for MQ–9 Reapers. It is also home to
the Powder River Training Complex,
training airspace for Ellsworth air-
crews and crews from across the United
States. In the very near future, Ells-
worth will be the home of the forth-
coming B–21 bomber.
When I was first elected to the Sen-
ate, Ellsworth’s future was not looking
bright. In fact, in 2005, just a few
months into my first term, Ellsworth
was targeted for closure by the Base
Realignment and Closure Commission.
Fortunately, thanks to the efforts of a
lot of dedicated people, we managed to
demonstrate to the Commission that
Ellsworth was a vital national security
asset and that closing the base and
moving its fleet of B–1s would actually
cost money.
Since then, strengthening Ellsworth
has been a priority for me and for a lot
of other people back home in South Da-
kota, and Ellsworth has been going
from strength to strength.
One of my proudest achievements as
a Senator was helping secure the ex-
pansion of the Powder River Training
Complex, the training airspace over
Ellsworth. The expansion quadrupled
the size of the airspace. But prior to
the expansion, the airspace was only
large enough for one B–1 bomber to
train at a time, which meant crews had
to commute elsewhere to meet their
training needs.
Today, the airspace is large enough
to hold large-force training exercises,
involving a variety of planes from
other bases. In fact, the Powder River
Training Complex is now the largest
training airspace in the continental
United States. In addition to the vast
space it offers for training exercises, it
also provides a valuable opportunity
for pilots to train in conditions that re-
semble combat missions, such as low-
altitude flying over mountainous ter-
rain.
Since the Powder River Training
Complex was expanded, Ellsworth has
hosted a number of successful large-
force exercises. This May, Ellsworth
hosted its most recent Combat Raider
large-force exercise, which featured B–
1, B–2, and B–52 bombers, J-STAR and
AWACS radar systems, F–16s, and KC–
135 tankers. Notably, F–35s from Hill
Air Force Base in Utah also partici-
pated, marking the first of what I
think will be many training opportuni-
ties for the F–35 in the Powder River
Training Complex.
These Combat Raider exercises high-
light the potential of the PRTC for
training our military aviators, and I
want to make sure that we can meet
these training needs as we look to
bring the B–21 into the fleet. That is
why I filed an amendment, Thune
amendment No. 759, to require a stra-
tegic airspace review.
My amendment would require a re-
port on how far our current national
airspace system meets our national se-
curity requirements and how we might
improve this system to meet current
and future training needs.
The Air Force and the Federal Avia-
tion Administration would be required
to consult on this report to develop a
full picture of the strategic value of
our national airspace.
The report would also analyze wheth-
er the current airspace system gives
the military sufficient access to the
airspace it requires to meet its world-
wide operational, training, and testing
needs.
In particular, it seeks to determine
whether current civil and military co-
operation mechanisms are providing
for the effective and efficient manage-
ment of the national airspace system
for military training. It also asks
whether the current Department of De-
fense and FAA processes provide suffi-
cient time to plan for large-force exer-
cises.
For example, in the Powder River
Training Complex, the Air Force needs
to go through a lengthy process to se-
cure altitude waivers from the FAA to
fly higher on just a few days a year for
just a few hours a day. We absolutely
need to have appropriate procedures to
ensure safety and coordination with
commercial airlines, but the Air Force
also needs enough lead time to sched-
ule its aircraft and airmen traveling
from other bases. We shouldn’t be miss-
ing out on critical training opportuni-
ties because of a lengthy process that
is ripe for expediting.
So my amendment would take a look
at this process, including whether FAA
air traffic control centers could tempo-
rarily or permanently realign their
boundaries to streamline their role in
military training.
For example, the Powder River
Training Complex straddles the conver-
gence of the Minneapolis, Denver, and
Salt Lake City air traffic control cen-
ters, and coordinating with all three
can be cumbersome. This report would
explore whether we can make the proc-
ess more efficient for both the FAA and
the military.
It would also review whether the cur-
rent airspace system is sufficient to
prepare military aviators to meet high-
end threats, including fifth-generation
aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and
hypersonic weapons.
It is important that we ensure that
our airmen can train in realistic condi-
tions so they can deliver when America
is counting on them the most. Just as
in sports, you play like you practice—
although we all know this isn’t play,
and the stakes for getting it right are
very high.
That is why my amendment would
investigate whether current civil and
military cooperation mechanisms are
sufficient for our military to replicate
contested combat airspace, denied ac-
cess airspace, and airspace without the
use of GPS—the kinds of conditions
aircrews would likely encounter if they
got the call to fight tonight.
My amendment also takes a step
back to look at the state of our na-
tional airspace system. It calls for an
audit of special-use airspaces, military
operations areas, commercial routes,
and other routes, and it asks if parts of
underutilized airspaces can be effec-
tively returned to the national air-
space to boost commercial route effi-
ciencies in high-traffic areas in ex-
change for more generous military
training flight permissions in low-traf-
fic areas.
Comparatively, we don’t get as much
commercial airline traffic up in the
Powder River Training Complex, cre-
ating a great opportunity for fifth-gen-
eration aircraft to really stretch their
legs and meet their training needs.
I have talked a lot about our mili-
tary’s need to have the best training
opportunities available. However, I
want to clarify that this is not a one-
sided amendment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4136 June 20, 2019
Our military goes to great lengths to
respect commercial and general avia-
tion needs, and that is reflected in my
amendment. First and foremost, the
FAA is consulted throughout the en-
tire report process. Additionally, the
bill reviews whether commercial and
general aviation receive sufficient no-
tice regarding exercises and special-use
waivers, and, as I mentioned, it looks
for ways to make Department of De-
fense and FAA interaction more effi-
cient.
As a former chairman of the Senate
Commerce Committee and a current
member of the Commerce Sub-
committee on Aviation and Space, I
know that the management of the na-
tional airspace is complicated. My
amendment simply seeks to gather in-
formation so that we can take a pro-
ductive look at our national airspace
and make sure our military aviators
can get the most out of their training
opportunities while respecting the
needs of commercial and general avia-
tion.
The Armed Services Committee
chairman and ranking member, my
colleagues, and staff members have a
lot of amendments to consider. Hun-
dreds of amendments have already been
filed on the National Defense Author-
ization Act, and there are more to
come. I would ask that my amendment
No. 759 be considered for inclusion as
we work together to restore and mod-
ernize our military and ensure our men
and women in uniform have the tools
they need to defend our country.
I thank my colleagues.

ARMS SALES
Mr. COTTON. Madam President,
there has been a lot of confusion and
outright misinformation about some
proposed arms sales to our gulf part-
ners—specifically, Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates. I am grate-
ful for the opportunity this morning to
clear up a few things, especially consid-
ering the current high stakes in the re-
gion.
As many of you probably have heard,
the Islamic Republic of Iran just this
morning shot down an American sur-
veillance aircraft over the Strait of
Hormuz—yet another act of reckless,
unprovoked aggression targeting law-
ful behavior on the high seas and in the
skies. Still, I know that for some of my
colleagues here, Iranian acts of vio-
lence are always to be excused or some-
how always the fault of America and
especially of the Trump administra-
tion, to which the only appropriate re-
sponse is to continue to appease the
ayatollahs, to send them pallets of
cash, as the last administration did,
and give them billions of dollars in re-
lief for sanctions—essentially to say:
Pretty please, stop your acts of terror-
istic aggression and imperial ambition
throughout the region.
It is my duty to inform all those col-
leagues that this is dangerous and mis-
guided thinking. Iran, as it did in the
mid-1980s, will meet American re-
straint with continued aggression. It
will watch the outcome of today’s
votes in support for our friends in the
gulf for signs of resolve or weakness. I
urge my fellow Senators to send the
right message to Tehran.
The administration plans to sell
roughly $8 billion in arms to our gulf
partners so they can defend them-
selves, as well as the many thousands
of Americans within their borders—all
from Iranian aggression. Canceling
those sales would not only endanger
Americans overseas and deprive Amer-
ican industry of billions in exports, it
would weaken some of the only coun-
tries in a position to effectively resist
Iran’s violent rampage throughout the
Middle East.
We have heard many objections to
these arms sales. First and most amaz-
ing, given the stakes, some Democrats
object for procedural reasons. They are
upset that the administration is pro-
ceeding over an informal hold placed
by the senior Senator from New Jersey.
In doing so, they claim that the admin-
istration is violating a long tradition
of honoring informal holds by the
chairman and ranking member of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
In effect, they are saying: Let’s block
arms sales to our allies in an emer-
gency because the Secretary of State
hurt the feelings of a few Senators.
The actual purpose of those holds—
only a courtesy; not a rule; not a law—
is to give those Senators time to fully
examine a proposal and to foster en-
gagement between the Senate and ad-
ministration in good faith. But that is
not how this hold is being used. These
arms sales have been held for more
than a year—more than a year. How
much time does the Senator from New
Jersey need to make up his mind? How
many times does the Secretary of
State have to call him and meet with
him? How many briefings do they have
to provide? How many memos do they
have to send?
This is not a request for more infor-
mation or trying to work together in
good faith. This is a stalling tactic,
through and through. It is yet another
example of the Democrats engaged in
psychological projection in accusing
this administration of violating norms,
when in fact they are the ones who
have been violating longstanding, un-
written rules, customs, and norms.
The administration is moving for-
ward with this sale by making an
emergency declaration, as provided by
law and as Presidents have done many
times in the past. President Reagan
proceeded with sales of air-defense sys-
tems to, yes, Saudi Arabia using this
very same provision. President George
H. W. Bush did so as well, selling tanks
and fighter aircraft to, yes, Saudi Ara-
bia.
Even without this precedent, can
there be any doubt—any doubt that our
partners in the gulf are facing a gen-
uine emergency as they fend off Iran?
Oil tankers flying the flags of our allies
and partners are ablaze in the Gulf of
Oman. Civilian airports, oil pipelines,
and American surveillance aircraft
have all come under rocket attacks
from Iran’s terror proxy in Yemen.
Make no mistake—this is a genuine
emergency, but too few of my col-
leagues are willing to see the plain
facts. They want to talk about any-
thing that will change the subject from
Iran and its campaign of aggression
throughout the Middle East.
A second objection is that some
argue that our gulf partners are some-
how beneath our support. Really? It
was the United Arab Emirates, after
all, that hosted Pope Francis earlier
this year, and he conducted a mass for
Christians in that nation. The King-
dom of Jordan is another important
friend caught in the crossfire of this
debate. Jordan has been a reliable and
trustworthy partner of the United
States for many years, and today it
bears the brunt of the refugee crisis
and chaos created by Assad’s Iran-
backed butchery in Syria.
While Democrats try to frame this
vote as support for our gulf partners
alone, let’s not forget that numerous
other strong allies of the United States
would be affected by these votes as
well, countries like the United King-
dom and France and South Korea and
Israel—all part of the supply chain af-
fected by these deals. Rejecting these
sales will hurt them, too, and now is
not the time to be rejecting our
friends. Of course, you couldn’t make
any of these observations about the Is-
lamic Republic of Iran, which is about
as likely to host the Pope as it is to
host a Pride parade.
Lost in the criticism of our partners
is a much more worthy discussion
about the elaborate architecture of tor-
ture and repression supervised by Aya-
tollah Khameini, who is personally re-
sponsible for American citizens being
held in appalling captivity for years at
a time. One such American citizen, Bob
Levinson, has been missing in Iran for
more than a decade.
The same media and politicians who
trumpet every misdeed of America’s
steadfast partners in the region—re-
gardless of whether such misdeeds are
fact or fiction—are strangely silent
about the undisputed fact that Iran has
the blood on its hands of more than 600
American troops in Iraq in the last dec-
ade. Six hundred Americans were
killed at the hands of Iran. Yet we pro-
pose to deny arms sales to some of the
only countries that are committed to
resisting Iran’s bloodstained, anti-
American theocracy? It is time to get
our priorities straight.

Third, still other critics fault our

the civil war in Yemen, as though they

than states that were pulled into a con-
flict to push an Iranian-armed rebel
group off of the Arabian Peninsula at
the request of the Government of
Yemen and with the support of the
United Nations. Evidently, some of my
fellow Senators would counsel our gulf
partners to do nothing as a rebel group,
armed by their sworn enemy, plunged a
neighboring country into chaos, shoot-
ing rockets at their airports and oil
pipelines. That would indeed be quite a
restrained foreign policy. Some might
also call it the height of stupidity that
we would never tolerate for our own
citizens.
As to the appalling human rights
conditions in Yemen, I think the cur-
rent U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, Matthew
Tueller, said it best to the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee: ‘‘Almost 100
percent of the humanitarian catas-
trophe in Yemen has been caused by
the Iranian-backed Houthis.’’ Almost
100 percent. Mr. Tueller is not some
Trump appointee. He is not some par-
tisan hack. He is a career Foreign
Service officer who served as Ambas-
sador to Yemen under, yes, President
Obama. If there is anyone in the U.S.
Government who is in a position to
know what is going on in Yemen and
who is to blame for the carnage in
Yemen, it is the man on the ground
rather than politicians in Washington.
Underlying this whole debate is a ro-
mantic wish—a naive delusion—that
our foreign policy can always be pris-
tine, requiring no compromises whatso-
ever, no acknowledgment of the messy
facts around the world, or even that we
could flee away from that messy, com-
plicated, dangerous world entirely, re-
lying solely on the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans to keep us safe. A cursory re-
view of history proves that neither op-
tion is available. A cursory review of
newspaper headlines proves it too.
Our main adversary in the Middle
East—the Islamic Republic of Iran—is
a revolutionary power dedicated, from
its inception years ago, to the destruc-
tion of Americans and, indeed, America
itself. They don’t try to hide it. ‘‘Death
to America’’ is their slogan, and they
chant it all the time. Our departure
from the field will not dissuade the
ayatollahs from that purpose; it will
only embolden them, as will the aban-
donment of our allies in the region.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order of
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. PAUL. Madam President, the
arms industry is a unique industry. It
is not like making shoes or apparel. It
is not like selling watches. You are
selling things that, when used prop-
erly, kill other people. They are deadly
weapons that we have. We have accu-
mulated the technology by the tax-
payer paying for this. We have heli-
copters, planes, guided missiles, and we
are able to refuel planes.
It is not a jobs program, and it is not
something that—we don’t willy-nilly
give weapons to everyone. We don’t sell
weapons to Russia and we don’t sell
weapons to China because we have dis-
agreements, and we don’t think it
would be in our best interest to sell
weapons to them.
We also don’t sell weapons, typically,
to people we think are untrustworthy.
I think there is every evidence that
Saudi Arabia can be put in that cat-
egory. When you have direct evidence
and when our own intelligence commu-
nity has concluded that there is high
confidence that the Crown Prince of
Saudi Arabia butchered a dissident
with a bone saw in a consulate in a for-
eign country, you would think that
would give us pause as to giving Saudi
Arabia or selling Saudi Arabia more
weapons.
But it is worse than that. We are not
only selling Saudi Arabia offensive
weapons, we are also talking about giv-
ing them nuclear technology. The nu-
clear technology, they say, is only for
energy, but you have to wonder. A
country that sits atop one of the larg-
est oil reserves in the world is now say-
ing ‘‘Oh, we don’t have enough fossil
fuel. We need nuclear power’’? There
have been people who have gotten nu-
clear technology and then have moved
on to nuclear weapons.
What could possibly be the worst
thing to happen to the Middle East? It
would be to have three powers there
with nuclear weapons. We had Iran be-
fore. They now have the knowledge to
enrich. They made an agreement not to
enrich. They are still threatening to
enrich uranium. What do you think
will happen if Saudi Arabia gets nu-
clear technology and there is any
rumor of their progressing on towards
developing nuclear weapons? What will
Iran do? Automatically, they will do
the same thing.
It also happens in the conventional
weapons arena. So every time we sell
or give missiles to Saudi Arabia, what
do you think Iran does? They have to
either buy more or make more. It is an
arms race. We are feeding both sides of
an arms race.
But you will hear people in Wash-
ington say: But Iran—they are a ma-
lign influence. Well, yeah. So is Saudi
Arabia. But what do we do when we
have two powers that show tendencies
toward evil and show tendencies to-
ward acting in ways that are against
our national interest? Do we just blind-
ly give weapons to anybody who is op-
posed to Iran because Iran is a malign
influence? Well, what about Saudi Ara-
bia? They have spent $100 billion
spreading this radical jihadism to
other cultures; $100 billion around the
world preaching hatred of Christians,
hatred of Jews, hatred of Hindus. Yet
we give them more weapons.
There is a madrasa supported by
Saudi Arabia—that is a so-called reli-
gious school in Pakistan—and 80 per-
cent of the boys who graduate from the
school—because, of course, girls aren’t
allowed to go to school under this kind
of religion—80 percent of the boys who
graduate from the school fight in the
Taliban against the United States.
Why would we give weapons to a coun-
try that teaches hatred of our country
and actually trains fighters to fight
against our soldiers? What person in
what insane world thinks it is a good
idea to fund people who fundamentally
don’t like us? Why in the world do we
keep doing this?
Last week, we voted on sending
weapons to Qatar. Do you know who
Qatar supplies weapons with? Hamas. I
thought we were allies with Israel. But
we fund Qatar, which sends missiles
and weapons to Hamas, who then
bombs Israel. Qatar also hosts fund-
raisers for ISIS. Remember ISIS—the
ones chopping people’s heads off? Why
would we give weapons to countries
that give weapons to our enemies?
In the Syrian civil war, we went in
on the side of those who were opposed
to Assad. Now, Assad is no saint, no
Democrat, no Jeffersonian Democrat,
no believer in freedom; yet the people
on the other side—most of them hate
Israel. Most of them despise any rights
for women. Most of them—many of
them are allied with al-Qaida. Who is
al-Qaida? The people who attacked us
on 9/11. Al-Nusra, al-Qaida, ISIS—who
do they get weapons from? Saudi Ara-
bia and Qatar.
Even Hillary Clinton admitted this in
one of the emails that were released.
Hillary Clinton was talking to John
Podesta by email, and she said: We
have to do something about this. Saudi
Arabia and Qatar are arming and pro-
viding logistical help to ISIS.
So why does it go on? Some would
say: Because people make a big profit
on this. This is a jobs program for the
arms industry, and we have to make
sure they make their profit.
I disagree. This is an industry that
uniquely has to do with our national
interests. It is uniquely paid for by the
taxpayer. These weapons are owned by
the taxpayer, and we should not sell
them to people who are not our friends.
This is what the debate is about
today. We will vote shortly on whether
or not we should sell offensive weapons
to Saudi Arabia.
What are they doing with the weap-
ons? Well, they are bombing civilians
in Yemen, for one. They are transfer-
ring some of the weapons in Yemen to
al-Qaida. Al-Qaida and the larger um-
brella group that attacked us on 9/11
are active. They are called AQAP in
Yemen. There are news reports in the
last week that Saudi Arabia is
indiscriminantly giving arms to any-
body who is opposed to the group they
are fighting against, the Houthis.
Who supports the Houthis? The Ira-
nians.

S4138 June 20, 2019
Is one side better than the other?
Are we so blind to the malign influ-
ence of Saudi Arabia that we give
money and weapons to anybody regard-
less of what they do? You can chop up
a dissident. You can cut a dissident up
to pieces with a bone saw, and we will
still give you weapons?
My goodness, I can’t imagine. I do
not think that people in this body who
will continue to sell weapons to Saudi
Arabia are listening to the people at
home. I guarantee, if we asked the peo-
ple at home, if we had a national poll
and everybody got to give their opin-
ion, how many people at home do you
think are saying: Oh, well, they just
chopped up a dissident—no big deal.
Let’s just keep sending them weapons.
Oh, well, they are giving weapons to
Hamas. Yes, you know, we don’t really
care. Or, well, they are bombing civil-
ians.
The Saudis killed 150 people at a fu-
neral procession—people marching at a
funeral procession. They knew it was a
funeral procession. This was no fog of
war, no mistake. This was an inten-
tional act to kill people at a funeral
procession. There were 150 people
killed and 450 wounded. About 1 year
ago, they killed 40 schoolchildren on a
schoolbus.
They are indiscriminately bombing
civilians, and they are blockading
Yemen, which is one of the poorest
countries on the planet. Millions of
people—some estimate between 14 and
17 million people—live on the edge of
starvation because of this war. The
Saudis are preventing food from com-
ing in. They have blockaded Hodeida,
which is one of the key ports where
food needs to come in. Yemen imports
80 percent of their food. The Saudis are
blockading them and people are starv-
ing, and we are allied with Saudis. We
supply them with bombs that they drop
on civilians and until the last few
months we were refueling the very
planes that were dropping the bombs.
People talk sometimes about, you
know, a dream of peace in the Middle
East. If you want to have a peace plan
in the Middle East, people say: Well, it
is Israel and Palestine who have to
come to a peace agreement.
Do you know what the bigger prob-
lem is—an even bigger problem than
that conundrum—which is a conun-
drum? It is figuring out how to have
peace between Saudi Arabia and their
allies and Iran. Everything around here
is Iran, Iran, Iran, Iran. Do you know
who spends the third-most amount of
money on the military in the world?
Saudi Arabia. First, it is the United
States. We spend more than the next 10
countries combined. We spend more
than all the rest of NATO combined,
for that matter. Then, a distant second
is China, and, then, there is Saudi Ara-
bia.
Saudi Arabia spends more on their
military than Russia and more than
most of our NATO allies. Yet people
say: Oh, we have to give them more
arms because Iran is a bad actor. What
if they are both bad actors?
Currently, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf
sheikdoms around them spend 8 times
more than Iran. I am not saying Iran is
a great place or that the government is
great. What I am saying is, when you
have two bad actors, when you have
two malign influences, do you think we
always have to choose the lesser of two
evils? Do we have to always look
askance and say: Oh, whatever—you
know, as long as we are doing some-
thing that is opposed to Iran.
One of our other so-called allies over
there is Bahrain. We have a naval base
there, and we say: It is important to
have a naval base, and we have to look
the other way. They have 4,000 political
prisoners. Saudi Arabia actually im-
prisons people for political reasons, and
they don’t just kill them. They behead
them and crucify them—I think, in
that order. They put the bodies out for
public display.
They executed a guy named Sheikh
Nimr al-Nimr, who was of a minority
religion. The Saudis are Sunnis. This
guy was a Shia religious person and
spokesman. He was executed. His neph-
ew is being held in prison and has been
for several years now. He was 17 when
he was arrested. His crime was sending
a text message to encourage people to
protest against the authoritarian re-
gime of Saudi Arabia.
I think the problem is that some peo-
ple come to the conclusion that arms
are always good and we should never do
anything to condition the sale of arms
to behavior. Well, I am not for sending
more arms there, period, because it is a
cauldron always threatening to boil
over.
Let’s say you were someone who
would say: Oh, no, we have to arm
them. Perhaps we should condition
arms on good behavior. Perhaps, if you
are cutting up a dissident with a bone
saw in a foreign country, maybe we
should stop arms for a while to see if
maybe you can get better people in the
government or maybe to see if your
ways will change.
Saudi Arabia said: Oh, we are doing
it differently now. We are not going to
fund radical jihadism around the world.
But they spent $100 billion infecting
the world with the ideas of hatred of
the West, hatred of Christians, hatred
of Jews, and hatred of Hindus. There
used to be a couple hundred of these
schools in Pakistan. There is now said
to be 20,000 schools in Pakistan. The
Saudis support schools not just in
Pakistan but throughout the world—in
Indonesia and India and all over the
Middle East. They support these
schools that teach intolerance and ha-
tred of the West. Yet we are one of
their biggest arms suppliers. It makes
utterly no sense, and it should be re-
considered.
We will have a chance to vote today,
and the numbers are growing. When I
first introduced a resolution to dis-
approve of arm sales to Saudi Arabia, I
think I got 22 votes. We did it again a
couple of months later, and I think we
got in the forties. I think there is a
chance today that we will get close to
60 votes.
We will have to get to 67 to overcome
a Presidential veto. Look, I am a big
fan of the President on many fronts,
but on this someone has to stand up,
even a Member of his own party and
say: Arms sales are not jobs programs,
and they should be conditioned on be-
havior, and we should not sell arms to
countries that hate us.
As for these countries that burn our
flag and chant ‘‘Death to America,’’ we
shouldn’t be arming them.
At one point in time, there were re-
ports about ISIS. Remember the people
who were beheading people in the
desert over the last couple of years and
spreading throughout the region?
There were reports that they have $1
billion worth of Humvees. Some of
them were captured, but some came be-
cause of indiscriminate arms. There
are arms everywhere.
So when we had the Syrian civil war
going on, all throughout the news
media—public, private, everywhere—
everyone was saying that Saudi Arabia
and Qatar were giving arms to any-
body, indiscriminantly giving arms to
people. One of the groups that got arms
and one of the groups that got anti-
tank weapons—these are shoulder-
launched missiles—said in a news re-
port right after they got them: When
we are done with Assad—they didn’t
talk about ISIS, and most of them
didn’t care about ISIS because they ac-
tually kind of agree with ISIS’s reli-
gion—we are going after Israel next.
So we are arming people who are po-
tential if not real enemies of Israel. We
are arming people who are teaching ha-
tred of the West, hatred of Christians,
hatred of Hindus, and hatred of Jews.
We are arming these people. Why are
we doing that?
Let’s say you don’t agree with every-
thing I have said, and you say: Well,
maybe we should get them to behave
better. Why don’t you withhold arms
for 6 months at the least?
Why don’t we just stop for a while?
They have enough arms to blow up
the Middle East 10 times over. Is there
just no stopping? Is there no limitation
to what we will do? Do we not believe
that any of our arms sales should be
conditioned on behavior?
This is a big deal and a big vote, and
it is my hope that the American people
will watch how people vote and decide:
Is this who I want representing me? Do
I want someone representing me who is
selling arms to people who hate our
country, who spend hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars on schools teaching ha-
tred of our country? Do I want to have
people representing me who continue
to flood the Middle East with arms?
That is what this vote is about, and
I hope the American public will pay at-
tention to how people vote today and
to which direction they want the coun-
try to go in.
We have had enough war. This is
something I agree with the President
on. We have had enough war. We have

been at war too long in too many
places.
We have been 19 years in Afghani-
stan, and to what end? I was for the
initial purpose of getting those who at-
tacked us on 9/11. I would have voted to
go. But after 19 years, it is nation-
building. We are spending $50 billion a
year. We build roads, and they blow
them up. We build schools, and they
blow them up.
We have roads and schools crumbling
in our country. We don’t have an extra
$50 billion to spend in Afghanistan. We
are $1 trillion short this year. We are
going to spend $4 trillion, and we are
bringing in $1 trillion—not great eco-
nomics, not great budget balancing on
our part.
No. 1, we cannot afford to try to be
everywhere all the time, and, No. 2, the
money we are spending overseas is
counterproductive.
We went into Iraq and toppled a dic-
tator. What did we get? Chaos. In the
chaos we get ISIS and other groups
forming.
We went into Libya and toppled the
dictator in Libya. What did we get?
Chaos. It is so confusing in Libya that
I am not even sure which side the U.S.
Government is supporting. They were
supporting the U.N.-sanctioned govern-
ment and now they appear to be sup-
porting military generals who are try-
ing to overthrow that government.
One thing is for sure: The country of
Qatar that we voted to send arms to
last week is supporting the side oppo-
site us. So we give arms to people who
are directly involved in a civil war
where we are involved on the other side
of the civil war. To me, it seems ut-
terly preposterous that we keep doing
that. There is Qatar’s support for the
other side in Libya and their support
for Hamas. They are letting ISIS and
al-Qaida do fundraising in their coun-
try.
Maybe we need to take a break from
the arms race in the Middle East.
I don’t think that someone can make
a practical or reasonable argument
that there has been more peace since
we sent more weapons over there. They
have plenty of weapons to kill each
other for another thousand years. They
have been killing each other for 1,000
years. They have enough weapons to
kill each other for another 1,000 years.
Maybe we don’t need to be involved
in every civil war in the world. Maybe
we can’t afford it, and maybe when we
have gotten involved, we had the unin-
tended consequences of actually mak-
ing it worse.
People have this idea that when you
topple a dictator, somehow the next
person they elect is going to be Thom-
as Jefferson. Well, guess what. Every
time we have toppled a dictator, the
people they end up electing are not
Thomas Jefferson. Sometimes in the
elections we don’t like whom they
elected in the elections and people go
back and topple them again.
So when Egypt actually had an elec-
tion, they elected somebody from the
Muslim Brotherhood. Many in the Mid-
dle East and many in our country
didn’t want him. So we helped to get
rid of him, and now we have a military
rule with no elections and with the
idea that you can be detained without
trial. People say: Well, it is stable. It is
another military autocracy, but we are
going to put up with it.
We need to rethink our approach to
the Middle East. We need to rethink
the approach that we need to arm one
or both sides in every war. We need to
think whether regime change is a good
idea, and we need to look at the prac-
tical effects of our foreign policy and
say: Are we safer somehow?
I think one universal truth is that we
are usually poorer by the time we are
done, because what we end up doing is
spending good money after bad.
I will give you a couple of examples
in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan we
spent $90 million in a luxury hotel in
downtown Kabul. You say: How does
that $90 million hotel protect us? Well,
it doesn’t, but it is money. Money runs
through all this. Somebody is getting
rich, but not the American taxpayer.
The guy who built it, I think, was a
Jordanian national, but he built a shell
of a hotel. He took the $90 million. He
got all the payment, and it was never
built. It mostly doesn’t have walls, and
none of it was completed. It is now a
danger because it sits up across from
our embassy and snipers crawl up in
the building.
So the thing is that we asked for $90
million, and we need more now be-
cause, apparently, we now need to tear
it down because it is a danger to our
embassy and our soldiers.
So if we could just get $200,000 more,
they are going to spend another couple
hundred thousand dollars tearing down
a hotel that we asked you to build in
the first place, which we had no busi-
ness building whatsoever.
We built a gas station for them in Af-
ghanistan, too. But because our pur-
pose in the military is now sometimes
to fight the enemy but also to fight cli-
mate change—you didn’t know this,
but part of the military’s goal is cli-
mate change now—so we built them a
gas station. But we want to reduce the
carbon footprint. So we built a gas sta-
tion that sells natural gas. Well, the
problem was, No. 1, nobody in Afghani-
stan has a car. The average income is
about $800. Almost nobody has a car,
and no one has one that burns natural
gas.
So what they did is that they had to
give them credit cards and buy them
cars that actually ran on natural gas.
We wanted to visit over there and the
military said it was too dangerous to
take us there. So we have no idea if it
is even in operation at this point.
I say we need to rethink this, and I
urge today a vote against selling more
arms to Saudi Arabia.
Thank you.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
SCOTT of Florida). The Senator from
South Carolina.
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will
be voting in support of the resolutions
of disapproval, and let me tell you why.
A strategic relationship with the
United States should be coveted, and
the difference between a relationship
and a strategic relationship is very im-
portant.
We deal with people all the time that
engage in practices that we don’t like,
abhor, and are against. Sometimes you
have to sit down and talk with Putin
about Syria. Sometimes you have to
sit down and talk with the Chinese,
even though they imprison the
Uighurs. And there are even more egre-
gious examples of the people you have
to deal with, because that is part of the
world as it is. But when you have a
strategic relationship—and we have
had one with Saudi Arabia for years—
it is different.
What brings me here today? I want
the people in Saudi Arabia—I have
many friends there. I value my rela-
tionships there.
I appreciate all that Saudi Arabia
has done in the past to work with the
United States, militarily and other-
wise, but I want to be clear to my
friends in Saudi Arabia—and really
throughout the world—a strategic rela-
tionship has certain requirements at-
tached to it. You don’t have to run
your country like the United States
would have you do. You don’t have to
mirror the United States in terms of
your values, but you do have to respect
the relationship.
There are certain minimum require-
ments that I think come with a stra-
tegic relationship: No. 1, you cannot
kill somebody in the most brutal fash-
ion in a consulate of another country—
which violates every norm known to
the international community—because
they wrote a bad article about you.
You cannot imprison people and tor-
ture them in the fashion that has been
going on in Saudi Arabia.
You cannot hold the Prime Minister
of another country captive for a period
of time to bend them to your will.
You cannot rendition people that
just simply oppose your views. Ter-
rorism cannot be defined as simple dis-
sent.
The reason I am voting with Senator
PAUL and others today is to send a sig-
nal to Saudi Arabia that if you act the
way you are acting, there is no space
for a strategic relationship. There is no
amount of oil you can produce that
will get me and others to give you a
pass on chopping somebody up in a con-
sulate. Did MBS do it? Yes—not be-
cause the U.N. said so but because our
intelligence and my common sense lead
me to believe there is no other viable
alternative. You can figure this one
out pretty quickly.
What happens next? It cannot be
business as usual. Saudi Arabia has
been a partner. They will have to be a
partner in the future. Shooting rockets
into Saudi Arabia from Yemen—Iran
supporting the Houthi rebels—bothers
me. Defensive armaments, I support,
but the war in Yemen is out of control.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4140 June 20, 2019
I am trying to deliver the strongest
message I know how to deliver: Don’t
take this relationship for granted—and
obviously you have.
It is disrespectful to the President of
the United States to put him in this
position. It is disrespectful to all the
allies in Congress for you to put us in
this position. Clearly, you don’t care
that much about this relationship. You
care more about the critics and main-
taining power at any and all cost.
Here is the deal: My relationship
with Saudi Arabia is forever changed,
and it will not go back to the way it
used to be until Saudi Arabia changes
its behavior. The leadership of Saudi
Arabia has charted a course that is
unsustainable. I reject. There is no
amount of oil that can be produced to
change my view that our values are
more important than oil. We can get
oil from other people, but your values
come from within.
There is no amount of threat coming
from Iran that is going to require me
to give a pass to this brutal, barbaric
behavior. More is expected of a stra-
tegic partner. Saudi Arabia doesn’t
protect the United States from Iran.
To believe otherwise is recasting condi-
tions on the ground.
Saudi Arabia has been a partner. I
hope they can be in the future, but
Saudi Arabia, through their leadership,
made a tremendously bad decision, and
it is just not Mr. Khashoggi. Until you
change in Saudi Arabia, until you em-
brace the concept that the strategic re-
lationship with the United States is
important, therefore, I must respect
it—I am not telling you how to run
your country. I am not saying you have
to be a Jeffersonian democracy. I re-
spect the right of self-determination by
all people, but I will not bless or turn
a blind eye to brutality that, in my
view, disqualifies a person or a country
from being a strategic partner.
If this doesn’t do it, what would? If
we give this a pass, what is next?
We are going to stand up to the thugs
in Iran. We are going to push back
against China’s cheating. We are going
after al-Qaida, ISIS, and all the other
bad actors on the planet. We are going
to work with people we don’t like, but
when it comes to a strategic partner-
ship, we need to put the world on no-
tice: It comes with a minimum price,
and that price is you cannot have a
strategic relationship with the United
States and behave in a fashion that
shows no respect for human dignity, no
respect for international norms.
You have lost me, and that is too
bad. I have been on this floor a lot
standing up for our friends in Saudi
Arabia—which has not always been
easy to do—but the days of treating
Saudi Arabia the way I used to treat
them are over.
My hope is we can find a way to re-
start this relationship, but it is going
to require change. That is why I am
voting to support these resolutions.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I
come to the floor again to urge my col-
leagues to stand up for Congress as a
coequal branch of government and as-
sert our institutional rights in the
arms sales process.
I want to thank my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle who have joined
with me in this effort to bring us here
today.
As we get ready to vote on these res-
olutions, I want to again remind my
colleagues what is at stake here. At
the end of the day, these votes are not
about any one President or any one
arms sale. There will be another Presi-
dent in the White House someday.
There will be another President who
will want to claim Executive authori-
ties to run over Congress and who will
want to use emergency declarations to
push through their agenda. We in this
body must embrace our article I re-
sponsibilities and ensure that we serve
as an effective check on whoever that
Executive is.
Regarding these resolutions, in par-
ticular, we must both assert our role in
upholding the rule of law at home and
use our position to ensure that when
our government seeks to sell weapons,
those sales advance our national secu-
rity interests and our values. It is the
Congress that provided the President
with the authority to sell arms while
retaining strong oversight in the proc-
ess.
At the risk of getting in the weeds, I
want to briefly explain why Secretary
Pompeo’s 22 emergency certifications
don’t meet the basic requirements laid
out by Congress in the Arms Export
Control Act. I will be submitting a fur-
ther statement for the RECORD detail-
ing my statutory concerns, and I en-
courage my colleagues to read it.
First of all, Secretary Pompeo pro-
vided us with one single emergency
declaration for 22 separate arms sales,
when the law requires each come with
its own individual justification. It is
obvious why the Secretary flouted the
statute: His bogus emergency doesn’t
pass the laugh test, in general. Fur-
thermore, the Secretary is trying to
justify these sales by relying on a sec-
tion of the Arms Export Control Act—
article 36(c)—that arguably does not
grant him the authority to do what he
is even trying to do.
Congress made fairly clear back in
2000 that this provision only allows for
the United States to make emergency
arms sales in very limited situations—
for example, to sell arms to NATO
partners and other steadfast allies that
share our values, like Israel, Australia,
and Japan.
This is a power grab, pure and sim-
ple, with lasting implications for the
role of Congress in the sale of arms
around the world. We cannot, as an in-
stitution, stand for it.
Let me turn to the proposed sales. As
a number of my colleagues and I have
already laid out, the administration’s
argument that this is an emergency
meriting pushing through $8 billion
worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates simply
does not pass muster.
The weapons sales this administra-
tion is trying to push through without
congressional review will not in any
way equip the United States or our al-
lies to better face any imminent
threats from Iran.
The Assistant Secretary of State, R.
Clarke Cooper, admitted as much mul-
tiple times last week before the House
of Representatives. In one instance, he
noted that the administration had been
considering this emergency determina-
tion for months. In another, he con-
ceded that a majority of these sales
will not even be functional or come on-
line for months or, even in some cases,
years.
Let’s take a moment to review why
last year I decided to put a hold on a
sale of 60,000 precision-guided munition
kits. Saudi Arabia, at the helm of its
coalition, has used these weapons to
devastating effects in Yemen. The two
resolutions we will consider individ-
ually relate to the sales of precision-
guided munitions and parts.
We have heard that these weapons
are humanitarian weapons. When they
are used to precisely target civilians,
how can we possibly continue to sell
them? These are components of bombs
that we know have killed thousands of
civilians in Yemen—patients in hos-
pitals, children on schoolbuses. In fact,
the Armed Conflict Location & Event
Data Project last week released data
showing more than 90,000 people have
been killed in Yemen since 2015. The
list goes on.
Yemen has become a humanitarian
catastrophe. Twelve thousand people
have died under the Saudi-led coali-
tion. There are 85,000 children who
have died from starvation in Yemen, an
incomprehensible moral tragedy. An-
other 14 million people remain at risk,
especially as cholera resurges across
the country.
This is the challenge we have. It is
our bombs that are dropping on those
civilians. We cannot morally continue
to support such a sale.
Secondly, Saudi Arabia, which con-
tinues to do this with impunity, also
with impunity went ahead and dis-
membered Jamal Khashoggi, a jour-
nalist who was a resident here in the
United States. The gruesome report of
the U.N. Special Rapporteur on this
issue is chilling. If the Senate wants to
make it very clear that even if you are
an ally, you cannot kill with impunity,
this is the moment.
It is also the moment to tell the UAE
that you can’t take our weapons and
give it to others whom we consider peo-
ple on the terrorist list. That is going
on here too.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4141
June 20, 2019
I urge my colleagues to stand up for
the Constitution, stand up for article I
in our rights here, stand up for the
Senate’s institutional role to ulti-
mately ensure that it has a say on
arms sales, stand up for the proposition
that we will not let any ally, simply
because they are an ally, kill a jour-
nalist with impunity—something we
cherish under our Constitution and the
Bill of Rights and the freedom of ex-
pression under the First Amendment—
and stand up for the proposition that
we will not let our bombs fall on inno-
cent civilians and have the moral re-
sponsibility, which will be a blemish on
our history for years to come.
This is the moment for the Senate to
stand up to its institutional preroga-
tives. This is the moment for the Sen-
ate to stand up for the Constitution. I
have heard so many of my colleagues
speak of the Constitution. This is the
moment. This is the moment to stand
up for some moral clarity.
This is the moment to send a global
message: You cannot kill journalists
with impunity. That is the message we
must send to Saudi Arabia.
Vote yes on the resolutions of dis-
approval. Stand up for these propo-
sitions. Let’s have a moment in which
the Senate can be a profile in courage.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho.
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, in just a
few moments, we are going to consider
S.J. Res. 28 through S.J. Res. 48. I urge
my colleagues to oppose these resolu-
tions and to consider the sales that we
are talking about here on their own
merits.
First of all, we are not talking about
the killing of Mr. Khashoggi. That was
a murderous act; it was an awful act;
and it cannot be condoned or tolerated
in any way, shape, or form. Yet it is
not what we are voting on here today.
Indeed, we hope to eventually bring to
the floor a resolution, possibly even a
bill, that speaks to that horrific act.
Those negotiations have been going on
for some time, and we hope to reach a
conclusion, but we are not talking
about that. We are talking about arms
sales that the administration has de-
termined are needed—and on which we
have all been briefed—because of the
current situation in the Middle East.
I want to speak very briefly about re-
cent events that have been happening
as far as Iran is concerned. Iran is con-
ducting activities that are very worri-
some and very troubling. When you
have these kinds of things happen, it is
obvious that a miscalculation can
occur, which is the most worrisome
thing here.
In any event, these arms sales are
needed. To be clear, in the current
statute, the administration is within
its legal authority to declare an emer-
gency. As stipulated in the Arms Ex-
port Control Act, which was passed by
this body, the President can act swiftly
if he concludes an emergency exists
that requires a proposed sale that is in
the national security interest of the
United States. That has occurred.
Presidential authority to waive con-
gressional notification was invoked for
the very first time by President Carter
in 1979. It has been used on three other
subsequent occasions. The administra-
tion has said, as in those cases, this is
a one-time invocation of the waiver au-
thority in response to an acute threat
from Iran. The administration has
since returned to the regular congres-
sional notification process for further
arms sales, which is in place today.
These sales are needed to address the
legitimate security requirements of
other countries we support in response
to there being numerous threats from
Iran and its proxies. These threats are
real. As the events over just even the
recent 24 hours have shown us, it is im-
portant that these countries be ready
to assist us and to act on their own be-
half to counter what Iran has been
doing.
Yesterday, Iranian-backed Houthi
militants struck a Saudi civilian desa-
linization plant with a land attack
cruise missile.
Last night, Iranian forces shot down
a U.S. drone that was operating in
international airspace over the Strait
of Hormuz. It is the third U.S. aircraft
they have targeted in recent weeks.
Last week, using limpet mines, Iran
attacked two oil tankers that were
traveling near the Strait of Hormuz.
Yesterday, German Chancellor Merkel
cited strong evidence that attributes
that attack to Iran. There are very few
people in the world who don’t know for
a fact that it has been Iran that has
been responsible for all of this.
On that same day last week, the Ira-
nian-supported Houthis fired a missile
at Abha International Airport, in
southern Saudi Arabia, and wounded 26
innocent Saudi civilians. Human
Rights Watch announced this Houthi
attack as a war crime.
On May 19, a rocket—likely by Iran’s
proxies—landed near the American Em-
bassy in Baghdad.
On May 14, Iran’s proxies used drones
to strike two strategically important
Saudi oil facilities.
Just 2 days earlier, on May 12, four
more tankers were targeted by Iran
while they were anchored in an
Emirati port.
Each month, Iranian-sponsored
Houthi rebels launch over 15 ballistic
missiles and weaponized, unmanned
aerial systems against Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates. This
poses a significant threat and endan-
gers the lives of 80,000 Americans who
reside on the Arabian Peninsula.
These are the most recent examples
of Iran’s destabilizing actions on the
world stage. These are serious, serious
matters. As I said before, this is worri-
some; this is troubling. The mis-
calculation of these kinds of things
cause hostilities that lead to very large
wars.
As Iran thinks through these things
and calibrates them and tries to make
determinations as to what is in its best
interest, it is not going well. If you lis-
ten to Iran’s public statements, they
clearly do not coincide with facts.
More importantly, Iran is miscalcu-
lating the resolve of the American peo-
ple. It is miscalculating the fact that it
is dealing with President Trump; it is
not dealing with a former President.
I have talked to the President about
this many times. He does not want to
go to war with Iran. The American peo-
ple don’t want to go to war with Iran.
This body does not want to go to war
with Iran. This President is absolutely
committed to protecting U.S. lives and
U.S. interests, and he will do so. Iran
should not miscalculate on that mat-
ter, for the President is deeply com-
mitted to that proposition.
Iran needs to back away from the
edge that it has taken everyone to and
deal with this matter entirely dif-
ferently than it has, or there are going
to be dire consequences.
In the face of the attacks I have de-
scribed and the intimidation, our allies
have an obligation to develop capabili-
ties to protect their citizens from such
threats. These arms sales are an essen-
tial part of our effort in helping them
build those capabilities and resist Ira-
nian intimidation.
I share my fellow Senators’ concerns
about the humanitarian crisis in
Yemen and the need for all combatants
to avoid civilian casualties. This pack-
age includes the sales of precision
weapons, which, when combined with
partner efforts to improve intelligence
in targeting, will enable those who use
the weapons to ensure their actions are
precise, discriminate, and proportional
so as to minimize civilian casualties.
The precision munitions in these sales
would also prove to be essential to
other countries’ efforts in defending
themselves from more direct attacks
from Iran.
Some of us have been briefed by U.S.
personnel who have worked specifically
with the Saudis to make these im-
provements, and I encourage my col-
leagues to have similar conversations.
If you care about reducing civilian cas-
ualties, you should be an enthusiastic
supporter of providing these exacting
capabilities, which will be transferred
pursuant to these sales. These are im-
portant for reducing civilian casual-
ties, and we should all support them.
In closing, I will repeat several key
points.
First, the emergency declaration is
legal.
Second, these sales are necessary to
answer for the legitimate security re-
quirements of other nations that work
to keep safe our fellow Americans who
work, travel, and live around the
world.
Third, to reject these sales at this
time and under these circumstances is
to reward recent Iranian aggression, to
encourage further Iranian escalation,
and most importantly, to encourage
the miscalculation on the part of the
Iranians, which will be disastrous if

Without objection, it is so ordered.
BORDER SECURITY
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, yes-
terday I had a chance to sit down with
a group of my constituents visiting DC
from the Rio Grande Valley. For those
who have never been to the Rio Grande
Valley, I highly recommend a visit. It
is a beautiful region, a unique part of
our country, rich in culture and his-
tory and full of hard-working people
and businesses that fuel our State’s
and the Nation’s thriving economy. As
record numbers of people continue to
mass migrate across our southern bor-
der, it has become one of the most
heavily impacted areas in our country,
and it is working hard to manage the
growing humanitarian crisis.
Last month alone, 144,000 people were
detained coming across our border. It
was the largest monthly total since
2006. It only begins to paint the picture
of how challenging this mass migration
has become. The vast majority of the
people who crossed last month were ei-
ther unaccompanied children or fami-
lies, putting a strain on resources
across the border, particularly when it
comes to detention facilities.
It is no mistake that the human
smugglers, whom we call coyotes back
home, have figured out that if you can
smuggle an unaccompanied child or
family across the border, you vastly
improve the chances of successfully
placing them in the United States.
That is because they understand our
laws better than many Members of
Congress do, and they know how to ex-
ploit them for their financial gain.
The detention facilities I referred to
a moment ago have been around a long
time—long before the current surge of
families and children began arriving at
our borders. They were built as short-
term detention facilities for single
adults. As trends have changed, the
men and women of Customs and Border
Protection have done everything in
their power to make these facilities
workable on an increasingly thin and
inadequate budget.
I want to pause for a moment to say
thank you to the men and women in
uniform who are providing around-the-
clock enforcement of our laws and pro-
viding quality and compassionate care
to the migrants in their custody. It is
a tough job. When you train to be a
Customs and Border Patrol agent, you
are not trained in child care, but that
is what many of them find themselves
doing—handing out juice boxes and dia-
pers and providing assistance to those
families as they seek to have their
claims for asylum adjudicated.
This is a tough job, and it is getting
tougher every day, particularly in the
Rio Grande Valley and along the bor-
der. Of the 144,000 crossings last month,
nearly 50,000 were apprehended in the
Rio Grande Valley, making it the most
heavily impacted of the entire border.
In fact, it should come as no surprise
that Texas is impacted more than any
other State because, of course, we
share a 1,200-mile common border with
Mexico. Two-thirds of the apprehen-
sions so far this fiscal year have oc-
curred in the Rio Grande Valley, El
Paso, or Del Rio sectors. As Federal re-
sources have rapidly depleted, Customs
and Border Protection officers and
agents have struggled to manage the
processing, care, and transportation of
these migrants, and local communities,
it should be no surprise, have stepped
in.
The Humanitarian Respite Center in
McAllen is one of several locations
working to care for the migrants and
has had its doors open for 5 years now.
In the summer of 2014, we saw then-un-
precedented numbers of Central Ameri-
cans, particularly children, arriving at
the border. This was back when Presi-
dent Obama called this a ‘‘humani-
tarian and security crisis.’’ The scenes
were heartbreaking and spurred many
folks to action to try to offer their
help.
Sister Norma Pimentel is the execu-
tive director of Catholic Charities in
the Rio Grande Valley and led the cre-
ation of this respite center. Migrants
who are released by CBP or ICE and are
awaiting a court date are often dropped
off at the center by officers or agents
themselves. There they can get food, a
hot shower, a good night’s sleep, and
travel to wherever they are going to
await their court date.
There is certainly a need for this
type of assistance under the cir-
cumstances, and it has been in exist-
ence only 5 years. The respite center
has helped more than 150,000 people and
continues its work as more people
cross the border each day.
The number of unaccompanied chil-
dren who illegally entered the United
States last month is higher than in any
other month since the 2014 surge that I
mentioned a moment ago. The weight
felt by those trying to provide assist-
ance is getting heavier and heavier. As
Federal resources dwindle, local com-
munities in the Rio Grande Valley and
along the entire Texas-Mexico border
have been filling the gaps, despite the
fact that, obviously, immigration and
the sovereignty of our borders are Fed-
eral responsibilities. In the absence of
Federal response, it is the State and
local communities that have had to
step up to help.
Like the respite center in McAllen,
these communities regularly provide
care, transportation, food, and shelter
for migrants in need. I believe this gen-
erosity shows the true Texas spirit and
helps illustrate how serious the prob-
lem has become and how desperately
additional Federal resources are need-
ed.
Thankfully, yesterday the Appropria-
tions Committee took action. The com-
mittee announced an agreement on a
border supplemental package that will
include humanitarian assistance need-
ed at the border. The nearly $4.6 billion
includes funding to support the mis-
sions of the Department of Health and
Human Services, which is providing
care for the record number of unaccom-
panied children who are arriving in the
United States. It also provides funding
for the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity, which is working to enforce our
laws and properly care for the adults
and families in their custody, as well
as the Departments of Justice and De-
fense. The hard-working men and
women in these Departments are work-
ing tirelessly to care for the migrants
in their custody, and I want to thank
each of them for working day in and
day out to enforce our laws. But, as I
mentioned, these are not the only folks
trying to provide support with minimal
support from the U.S. Government.
Earlier this month I sent a letter to
the chairman and ranking member of
both the Appropriations Committee
and the Homeland Security Sub-
committee, requesting that the funding
package include reimbursement for
local communities that helped carry
the weight of the humanitarian crisis.
NGOs, nongovernmental organizations,
like the respite center in McAllen are
trying to do more and more with less
and less. Cities and counties are divert-
ing hard-to-come-by taxpayer dollars
from their intended purposes, such as
public safety, power, and clean drink-
ing water, to do the job that is the re-
sponsibility of the Federal Govern-
ment. It is unfair for these folks to pay
for a humanitarian crisis that is not of
their making. I am glad to see the Ap-
propriations Committee taking some
action to right this wrong.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4146 June 20, 2019
The funding agreement yesterday in-
cludes $30 million available nationwide
for direct reimbursement for local gov-
ernments, States, and NGOs that have
spent millions of dollars to respond to
this crisis. Communities, both along
the border and throughout the State of
Texas, will be able to request reim-
bursement directly through local and
national boards of the Emergency Food
and Shelter Program at the Federal
Emergency Management Agency to
help lessen the financial burden they
have incurred over the past few
months.
I want to thank the chairman and
ranking member and all of our col-
leagues on the Appropriations Com-
mittee for supporting this effort to
help alleviate this strain on Texas
communities. The funding bill received
broad bipartisan support in the com-
mittee and passed by a vote of 30 to 1.
I hope we will soon have the oppor-
tunity to pass this important funding
bill here in the Senate. I encourage our
friends in the House to put politics
aside and do the same.
As happy as I am that the appropria-
tions committee has come up with this
additional money, this is still a matter
of treating the symptoms and not the
underlying cause. President Trump, in
his frustrations with congressional in-
action, threatened to impose addi-
tional tariffs on the nation of Mexico.
Fortunately, the negotiations that en-
sued came up with a plan for Mexico to
work with the United States to begin
to slow down or stop the flow of people
from Central America across Mexico
into the United States.
I have never seen anything quite like
that before in terms of our relationship
with Mexico. They have historically
tended to view immigration as our
problem, not theirs, as well as the drug
problem, because the demand in Amer-
ica is our problem and not theirs. This
really represents a change of attitude
on behalf of President Lopez Obrador’s
administration, and I want to con-
gratulate President Lopez Obrador and
his administration for working with
the United States to address a joint
problem. This is not just Mexico’s
problem. This is not just the problem
of the United States. This is our shared
challenge. Working together, I am con-
fident we can begin to address it.
Finally, I want to say that Congress
has largely been AWOL when it comes
to dealing with this humanitarian cri-
sis up to this point. A couple of months
ago, my colleague from the House of
Representatives, HENRY CUELLAR, a
Democrat from Laredo, TX, and I in-
troduced a bill we called the HUMANE
Act, which would fix some of the gaps
in our laws that are being exploited by
the human smugglers and are causing
this humanitarian crisis in this huge
flood of humanity coming into the
United States.
If Congress would accept its responsi-
bility and do its job, it would never
have been necessary for the President
to threaten additional tariffs on Mex-
ico, forcing this diplomatic negotia-
tion. I am glad it resulted in a good
and positive outcome, that negotia-
tion, but the fault ultimately lies with
Congress for not taking up and debat-
ing and voting on bipartisan legislation
like the HUMANE Act that has been
introduced in the Senate and in the
House.
I will say that Chairman GRAHAM of
the Judiciary Committee has been fo-
cused like a laser on this issue. We
were scheduled to mark up a bill today
in the Judiciary Committee that I be-
lieve would incorporate many provi-
sions of the HUMANE Act as part of a
bill which would, I believe, address this
humanitarian pull factor because of ex-
ploitation of those gaps in our asylum
laws. That now has been postponed, but
I hope the discussions will continue be-
cause, ultimately, this is a matter of
congressional responsibility. We can be
glad that the Appropriations Com-
mittee stepped up and provided addi-
tional resources, including this $30 mil-
lion in reimbursement for local com-
munities. We can be glad that Mexico
and the United States are finally now
working together on this shared chal-
lenge, but ultimately, if we are going
to address not just the symptoms but
the causes of this humanitarian crisis,
it is up to Congress. I believe the
American people will ultimately hold
us accountable, as they should.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
YOUNG). The Senator from Delaware.
75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GI BILL
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, this
Saturday is June 22. It is not just any
June 22. It marks 75 years to the day
that Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed
into law one of the most significant
pieces of legislation in our Nation’s
history. It was called, and is called, the
Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944.
We know it today as the GI bill.
Since 1944, the GI bill has helped lit-
erally millions of not just servicemen
but a lot of servicewomen. When you
look at our Armed Forces today, there
are a lot of servicewomen who serve in
the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine
Corps, and in the Coast Guard. I re-
member being a midshipman at the
Ohio State Navy ROTC in the 1960s,
and we had no women in our unit.
There were no women in any ROTC
unit in colleges across the country, as
far as I know. There were no women
who were nominated to attend armed
service academies—the Naval Acad-
emy, Air Force Academy, Merchant
Marine Academy. None of them had
women. I got to my squadron on the
west coast during the Vietnam war,
and we had about 300 men in my squad-
ron. About 10 percent were officers.
The others were enlisted men. We had
no women in my squadron.
All that has changed. When you go to
any college that has a ROTC unit
today, they are allowing women in. In
the academies, you find women. In my
old squadron, we find women. They are
not just E–1s, E–2s, and E–3s; they are
O–4s, O–5s, O–6s, and they are doing a
great job. The GI bill is for them too.
Since 1944, the GI bill has helped mil-
lions of World War II veterans purchase
a home, pay for a higher education or
obtain job training and, in turn, trans-
formed our Nation’s economy.
Our Presiding Officer, who has served
our country in uniform, knows of what
I speak. I was just off of Active Duty at
the end of the Vietnam war and in
Delaware when I finished up my MBA,
which is financed in part by the GI bill.
I had scraped enough money together
to buy a house. I think it cost about
$35,000. I didn’t have $35,000, but with
the help of the GI bill, I was able to get
a mortgage and buy my first home, all
those years ago.
In the years since World War II, the
GI bill has continued to change the
lives of millions of veterans by spur-
ring economic opportunity and helping
to create the middle class as we know
it today. That is why earlier this week
I was proud to reintroduce a bipartisan
resolution in the Senate, alongside my
colleagues Senators JOHNNY ISAKSON of
Georgia and JON TESTER of Montana.
They are the chair and ranking mem-
ber of the Senate Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs, which designates this
week as National GI Bill Commemora-
tion Week, celebrating the historical
significance of the GI bill and renewing
our commitment to improving the
lives of our Nation’s veterans for years
to come.
I want to share with you a couple of
reasons why the GI bill is oftentimes
referred to as the ‘‘greatest legisla-
tion’’ and share with you how it
changed my life and really the life of
my family.
After World War II, millions of re-
turning veterans flooded our Nation’s
colleges, our universities, and our vo-
cational schools. It was the GI bill that
made financial support, education, and
homegrown programs available to
those 16 million veterans returning
home and helped to usher in an era of
unprecedented economic expansion.
According to the 1988 report from the
Joint Economic Committee, it was es-
timated that for every $1 the United
States invested in our GIs through the
GI bill, about $7 were returned in eco-
nomic growth for our country.
I am going to say that again. Accord-
ing to the Joint Economic Committee
in 1988, it was estimated, for every $1
the United States invested in the GI
bill, about $7 were returned to our
economy. It is a pretty good return.
Those are big returns. I wish I could
say for every dollar we invested in Fed-
eral Government spending that we got
seven bucks back, in terms of economic
growth. We don’t. So this is something
to know.
Thanks to the original GI bill, 450,000
engineers, 240,000 accountants, 238,000
teachers, 91,000 scientists, 67,000 doc-
tors, 112,000 dentists, and thousands of
other professionals entered our coun-
try’s workforce, and many folks en-
tered the workforce with skills in
building trades, in assembly oper-
ations. You name it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4147
June 20, 2019
The GI bill truly democratized our
higher education system. It established
greater citizenship and civic participa-
tion and empowered the ‘‘greatest gen-
eration’’—my parents’ generation—to
lead our country following World War
II.
At the end of World War II, my dad
was the chief petty officer in the Navy
and served until the end of World War
II and a little bit after that and served
many years after that as a chief petty
officer in the naval reserve for, I think,
30 years in all. He came back. Before he
went to work, he took advantage of the
GI bill, and he had a real knack for fix-
ing things and building things. He was
very skilled in that regard. He had a
high school education. He and my mom
graduated from Shady Springs High
School in Beaver, WV. They were mar-
ried during World War II. My sister was
born in 1945, and I was born in 1947. My
dad used the GI bill, he once told me,
to learn how to fix wrecked cars, how
to be an auto body repairman. He
ended up working at an Oldsmobile
dealership in Beckley, WV, Burleson
Oldsmobile, using the skills he gained
from the GI bill. He worked there for a
year or two. One day, a claims adjuster
came in from the Nationwide Insurance
company. Nationwide insured a car
that was being repaired by my dad. The
claims adjuster talked to my dad about
the car and how it was coming. Some-
where in that conversation, the fellow
from Nationwide Insurance said: You
know, you could do what I do.
My dad said: You mean be a claims
adjuster for Nationwide Insurance?
The guy said: Yes, you could do this.
You have a lot on the ball.
Two years later, my father was a
claims adjuster for Nationwide Insur-
ance. He continued to repair wrecked
cars as a hobby. We had any number of
cars in our family that looked as good
as new. He would take them on week-
ends and went to a garage and fixed
them, painted them, and they were as
good as new.
Out of that humble beginning as a
claims adjuster for Nationwide Insur-
ance—he was very proud of the work he
did, but he ended up 20, 25 years later
as one of the top instructors for Na-
tionwide in their home office in Colum-
bus, OH, teaching all the claims adjust-
ers from across the country for Nation-
wide how to do the job adjusting
claims, working on claims.
Here is a picture of my dad, Wallace
Richard Carper. He went by Richard,
his middle name, my middle name. He
instructed a bunch of folks in the home
office in the training school in Colum-
bus, OH. Here he is with some of his
compadres, some of the fellow teachers
whom he worked with. It started with
the GI bill.
I know people who used the GI bill to
get an undergraduate degree or 2-year
degree, associate’s degree, a master’s
degree, a Ph.D. Not everybody used the
GI bill for that. My father used it in a
way that actually ended up enabling
him to not only get a good blue-collar
job but also actually to end up doing
this kind of work as well. I am proud of
him and thankful to the GI bill for
helping him get started and serve as a
role model for my sister and me.
My own career, I served 5 years on
Active Duty as a midshipman, before
that at Ohio State, and served 5 years
in the Vietnam war, three tours in
Southeast Asia. I wanted to stay in the
Navy. I wanted to go to graduate
school after my career. The Navy
wasn’t ready to send me to Monterey. I
wanted to go to Monterey to graduate
school. The Navy wasn’t ready to send
me to a postgraduate school. They said
to come back and talk to them in a
couple of years.
I wanted to go to graduate school. I
entered my regular commission, took a
Reserve commission, and moved from
California to Delaware—the University
of Delaware—and enrolled on the GI
bill to go to graduate school.
The next weekend, after I showed up
in Delaware, I drove up the road to Wil-
low Grove Naval Air Station in Penn-
sylvania, north of Philadelphia, and
they were just getting the Navy P–3
aircraft. I had been a P–3 aircraft mis-
sion commander during the Vietnam
war. I said: Are you looking for people
who might help train these sailors at
Willow Grove on how to use these P–3
airplanes?
He said: We need somebody. We need
some help, and we are were happy to
sign you up.
I flew with them for another 18 years
and retired as a Navy captain.
Before I did those 18 years, I went to
graduate school at the University of
Delaware and earned an MBA, and that
helped me go to work for the State of
Delaware in economic development,
right out of graduate school, and later
had a chance to run for the State treas-
urer. Nobody wanted to run. In know-
ing I had an MBA from the University
of Delaware, some people thought
maybe I could be a pretty good State
treasurer. We ended up starting with
the worst credit rating in the country
back in 1977, and 6 years later, we had
doubled the credit rating. Pete du Pont
was our Governor, and he was a great
Governor.
I hope I helped a little bit along the
way. That GI bill helped me in earning
my MBA and, later, to have had a
chance to have served in the House,
then as Governor, and now here in the
Senate. So I am deeply grateful to the
people of this country for investing in
me. I tried to work hard to repay that
investment they made in me all those
years ago.
Today’s veterans can take advantage
of the post-9/11 GI bill. It is an incred-
ible benefit that pays the full cost of
tuition at public colleges and univer-
sities, offers a generous housing allow-
ance, and pays for books. It can even be
transferred to veterans’ spouses or
children.
In 2017, I was proud when Congress
enacted the Forever GI bill—legisla-
tion that expanded the GI bill and
strengthened the protection for our
veterans, for Purple Heart recipients,
for National Guard reservists, and for
surviving spouses and children.
About 2 or 3 weeks ago, we had a
send-off ceremony in the Delaware Na-
tional Guard facility in Smyrna, DE,
which is just north of Dover. There
were 20 or so National Guard men and
women. They were about to ship off for
Iraq and other surrounding countries
in that part of the world.
In my remarks to send them off and
wish them well, I mentioned, when
they come home, they will be eligible
for the GI bill if they have a total of 36
months of service, which will enable
them to go to college for free—to the
University of Delaware, to Delaware
State University, or to the Delaware
Technical Community College. There
will be no tuition, and books will be
paid for. If they need tutoring, it will
be paid for, and they will receive a
$2,000-a-month housing allowance.
When we came back from Southeast
Asia at the end of the Vietnam war, in
the GI bill, we received a $250-a-month
allowance for everything. That was it.
It was all there. The GI bill that our
veterans inherit today, receive today,
is just incredibly generous and is, actu-
ally, very helpful in terms of recruiting
people to serve in an all-volunteer
military.
One of the aspects of the bill that I
mentioned a minute ago was, if a GI
doesn’t use his or her GI bill, his or her
spouse can use it. If his or her spouse
doesn’t use it, his or her dependent
children can use it. Sometimes that
happens, and I want to share one sad
but, in the end, hopeful story about one
servicemember’s GI benefits.
His name was Christopher Slutman.
He grew up not too far from Delaware,
but he ended up serving in New York
City as a fireman and had been one for
15 years. In the words of Winston
Churchill, he was twice a citizen be-
cause, in addition to doing that, he
served in the Reserves for a number of
years—not in the Navy but in the Ma-
rines.
His unit was activated. He was acti-
vated, and he ended up in Afghanistan
on Active Duty. He took leave from his
day job as a firefighter in New York
City to put on a different uniform and
ship out with his colleagues to go to
Afghanistan. He was serving there on
Active Duty—a marine reservist acti-
vated—when, one day while on patrol
within the Humvee, they ran across a
bomb that exploded and killed him,
Christopher Slutman, and killed two
other marines who were in the vehicle.
Along with CHRIS COONS, my col-
league here in the Senate; LISA BLUNT
ROCHESTER, our only Representative at
large of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives; our Governor, John Carney; the
Secretary of Defense; the head of the
Marine Corps; and a lot of other people,
several days later, I stood on the flight
line at Dover Air Force Base with the
families of those three marines who
died.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4148 June 20, 2019
One of the people among the three
families was Christopher Slutman’s
now widow. Shannon Metcalf Slutman
was there, who has earned three de-
grees herself—her undergraduate from
the University of Delaware, a master’s
degree, and a doctorate degree—and
her three daughters were not. I think it
was late at night. They were probably
at home and probably in bed.
When Christopher Slutman died, he
left behind a widow, and he left behind
three little girls, ages 4, 8, and 10. His
wife doesn’t need to go to school any
further. She is educated well beyond
my dreams. Do you know what,
though? They have three daughters,
and we are going to make sure, when
they are old enough to go to college,
they will be able to inherit and use the
GI bill’s benefits that their father and
their mother will never use.
A lot of times, we think about what
the GI bill does to help servicemembers
like me and like my dad, but it also
helps a lot of families in ways we,
maybe, never imagined. So I think we
celebrate 75 years of the gift that this
legislation provides to those survivors,
like to the three Slutman girls, as they
prepare to face the world without their
father.
In closing, I am proud to join fami-
lies across our country today in cele-
bration of the importance of the GI bill
over the last three-quarters of a cen-
tury. It has enabled hundreds of thou-
sands of veterans, including, as I said
earlier, my dad and me, to pursue our
dreams and to, hopefully, contribute in
some way to our Nation and to our
economy. This week, we reaffirm our
commitment to making sure that all
veterans today have similar experi-
ences—maybe even better experi-
ences—than we had and that they get
the most out of their hard-earned GI
bill benefits.
I ask all of my colleagues to join us
today, here in this Chamber and across
the country, in wishing the GI bill a
happy 75th birthday. Here is to another
75 years of improving the lives of our
Nation’s veterans.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia.
TRIBUTE TO BILLY PAYNE
Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise to
do something I rarely do. To start, I
want to talk about a very special Geor-
gian and a good friend of mine—a man
by the name of Billy Payne. Billy is a
husband, a father, a grandfather, a
great Georgian, and, yes, a great Amer-
ican. Recently, he was one of five indi-
viduals to be inducted into the 2019
World Golf Hall of Fame. It is quite an
honor. Billy Payne is a riveting story-
teller, a creative thinker, and an effec-
tive leader.
Golf Magazine once wrote: ‘‘Wherever
he goes, Payne is the most interesting
person in the room.’’
Billy was born in Athens, GA, and he
went on to play football for his home-
town team, the Georgia Bulldogs. He
earned a law degree from the Univer-
sity of Georgia and went on to open a
small practice in Atlanta.
After helping to raise money for a
new sanctuary at their church, Billy
and Martha, his wife, were inspired and
started looking for ways to make a dif-
ference in their community. The day
after the new sanctuary was dedicated,
Billy Payne came home from work and
said to Martha: I’ve got it—we’re going
to bring the Olympics to Atlanta. Billy
was undaunted by the magnitude of
this decision.
He didn’t have many connections at
the time, but he called up city and
State officials and formed a team to
make a bid to host the 1996 Olympic
Games. Billy spent the next 31⁄2 years
personally traveling to 110 countries to
convince Olympic officials to bring the
games to the city of Atlanta. On Sep-
tember 18, 1990, Atlanta won the bid for
the 1996 Olympics all because of Billy
Payne’s leadership and his vision for
the city.
The 1996 Olympics put Atlanta on the
world map. It transformed the city and
allowed us to build infrastructure that
later helped Georgia to become the No.
1 State in the country in which to do
business. To this very day, my alma
mater, Georgia Tech, actually uses dor-
mitories that were built to house the
athletes in the 1996 Olympics in At-
lanta.
After serving as President and CEO
of the Atlanta Committee for the
Olympic Games, Billy was invited to
join Augusta National. In a very short
period of time—actually, in 2006—he
was selected to be the club’s chairman,
which is a role he served in for 11
years. Billy oversaw the Masters Tour-
nament and turned it into a global
brand with worldwide reach. When
Billy took over at Augusta National,
the club’s membership was all male.
Under his leadership, Augusta National
broke the gender barrier and allowed
women to join the club for the very
first time.
He also started two major amateur
events—the Latin America Amateur
and the Asia-Pacific Amateur. The
winners of these tournaments are in-
vited to play in the Masters each year.
As a result, young people from all over
the world now have a chance to actu-
ally compete in the Masters every
year.
In 2014, Billy launched the Drive,
Chip & Putt Championship—a junior
golf competition that gives 7- to 15-
year-olds the opportunity to develop
their golf skills, to compete with their
peers, and to earn the opportunity to
actually play and compete at the Au-
gusta National on the Sunday before
the Masters. I have seen this. It is an
exciting event to see these young peo-
ple compete at the very home of the
Masters.
Probably the greatest achievement,
however, for amateur golf may have
been this year’s first Augusta National
Women’s Amateur tournament. When
the final pair walked onto the 18th
green arm in arm—one the winner, the
other the runner-up, two women, arm
in arm, cheering each other—it was a
highlight in amateur sports. In my
opinion, Bobby Jones, who is the hero
of amateur sports in America, was in
Heaven and probably stood up and
cheered.
Finally, Billy had a hand in naming
his alma mater’s football field, Sanford
Stadium, after his coach at the Univer-
sity of Georgia, Vince Dooley. Last
month, the university’s athletic board
approved the name change, and now
the field is officially known as Dooley
Field at Sanford Stadium.
I would be remiss if I didn’t say ‘‘Go
Dogs’’ this morning.
Clearly, Billy Payne’s impact on
Georgia and the entire country is hard
to measure, but I want to tell you a
story that really tells the true heart of
this leader from our State.
After he announced his retirement
from being the chairman of Augusta
National, he was at a private dinner
and was asked by no less than Bret
Baier what he was going to miss the
most. Without hesitation, Billy said,
‘‘The people.’’ Well, those of us at the
table thought he might have been talk-
ing about the members, but he wasn’t.
He was talking about the employees at
Augusta National. Its employees have
been there for their entire careers, and
they adore this man because he loves
them. He treated them right, and he
built their careers there.
His tenacious spirit, his love for hu-
mankind, and his steadfast leadership
serve as an inspiration to us all. I
thank Billy Payne for his lifetime of
service to the State of Georgia and to
the United States, and I congratulate
him, his wife, and their kids on this in-
duction into the World Golf Hall of
Fame.
BORDER SECURITY
Mr. President, on another topic,
there is a growing crisis at our south-
ern border, and we are told, next week,
we are actually going to vote on an ap-
propriations package for humanitarian
aid at the southern border.
Recently, I and a colleague of mine,
Senator STEVE DAINES of Montana,
traveled down to the McAllen sector of
the border in Texas. We went out on
patrol overnight with the Customs and
Border Patrol agents—we were out all
night with them—and then went on pa-
trol in the early morning hours just as
dawn broke on the river. We saw first-
hand that we don’t have just an illegal
immigration problem—we have a na-
tional security crisis right there at our
southern border.
My biggest takeaway was that the
drug trafficking down there has now
risen to being a full-blown crisis. Be-
tween fiscal year 1997 and fiscal year
2018, the CBP saw a 22-percent increase
in heroin, a 38-percent increase in
meth, and a 73-percent increase in
fentanyl seizures. In that year alone,
fiscal year 2018, enough fentanyl was
brought into the country illegally to
kill every woman, man, and child in
America. The Border Patrol agents we

spoke to estimated that they are only
able to interdict between 7 and 10 per-
cent, however, of the drugs that actu-
ally cross the border in the McAllen
sector. That is a crisis. If for no other
reason, we have a crisis.
In addition, the amount of human
trafficking we are seeing at the border
is unprecedented. Last month alone,
144,000 individuals were apprehended at
our southern border. This is the high-
est number of apprehensions in over 13
years.
In just the first 8 months of the fiscal
year, 411,000 unaccompanied children
and family units were apprehended at
our southern border, including 84,000
family units and 11,000 unaccompanied
children, just last month—11,000 unac-
companied children. How does an unac-
companied child get all the way from
Honduras or Guatemala to our border?
This is a conspiracy led by the car-
tels. I have seen it firsthand. We heard
the gunfire across the river the night
we were on patrol. It is real.
If this trend continues, 800,000 chil-
dren and families could be apprehended
at the southern border by the end of
this fiscal year alone. To put that in
perspective, we issue 1.1 million legal
green cards a year that are a pathway
to citizenship. This year alone, just the
family units alone could be 800,000 peo-
ple apprehended at the southern bor-
der. Clearly, our Border Patrol agents
are overwhelmed.
When an unaccompanied child arrives
at the border, they are cared for by
Border Patrol agents until they can be
placed in the care of the Department of
Health and Human Services. However,
the number of children arriving today
greatly exceeds HHS’s capacity to deal
with them.
As of last week, 1,900 unaccompanied
children were in CBP custody awaiting
placement in HHS’s care. But Health
and Human Services had less than 700
beds in which to place them.
Now, according to the Department of
Homeland Security, Border Patrol
agents are spending more than half of
their time caring for families and chil-
dren, providing medical assistance,
driving buses, and acting as food serv-
ice workers instead of performing law
enforcement duties.
Pulling Border Patrol agents away
from their law enforcement duties only
exacerbates the crisis at the border. We
saw that firsthand on our overnight pa-
trols.
The Acting Commissioner of CBP
said recently: ‘‘We are in a full-blown
emergency, and I cannot say this any
stronger: the system is broken.’’
On May 1, the Trump administration
requested $4.5 billion in funds to help
address the growing crisis at the bor-
der. At the time, we were debating dis-
aster relief for my home State of Geor-
gia and a dozen other States across the
country.
On May 23, President Trump broke
the logjam and agreed to separate bor-
der humanitarian aid from the disaster
relief question and it allowed us, then,
within hours on this floor, to pass the
disaster relief bill. Now we have to do
the same thing for this humanitarian
aid to the border.
Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis
at the southern border has only contin-
ued to escalate, and we have to do
something about it right now.
This week, Health and Human Serv-
ices and the Department of Homeland
Security sent a letter to every Member
of Congress. It said: ‘‘Absent an emer-
gency appropriation, we anticipate
running out of funding as soon as later
this month.’’
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity has already started pulling re-
sources away from critical missions in
order to try and keep up with this
surge of human traffic. Without addi-
tional funds by August, the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security says they
will have to redirect manpower and
funding from TSA, FEMA, and the
Coast Guard in order to address the cri-
sis at the border.
The Acting Director of ICE just re-
cently said: ‘‘We are begging. We are
asking Congress to please help us.’’
This should not be a political issue. I
am hoping that it will not be. This is
about giving Federal agents the re-
sources they need to care for children
and families in their custody and re-
spond to this crisis situation.
Even the New York Times editorial
board said this: ‘‘Congress, give Trump
his border money.’’ That is the New
York Times, not a big fan of our Presi-
dent.
The Senate will vote on this emer-
gency funding next week, and I hope it
will receive bipartisan support. It abso-
lutely should. Going forward, we have
to address the underlying cause of this
crisis, however.
Since 2014, the number of unaccom-
panied children and family units arriv-
ing at the southern border has sky-
rocketed because of loopholes in our
asylum and immigration laws. Minors
and family units can easily assert
broad and unspecific asylum claims.
Then, they are released into the United
States while they await formal re-
moval proceedings, which could be
months or years down the road.
These loopholes, combined with pro-
grams like the DACA Program, have
led to a staggering increase in the
number of unaccompanied children and
family units arriving at our border.
Oftentimes, these kids and families
are exploited by cartels on their jour-
ney to the United States and are in
dire need of human services by the
time they get here. It is truly heart-
breaking what some of these people go
through. These cartels profit off the
most vulnerable. They fuel the drug
trade and endanger communities across
our country—indeed, the world, for
that matter. We have to put the cartels
out of business. We have to close these
loopholes that encourage illegal immi-
gration into our country.
Finally, we have to give the Border
Patrol officers the tools they need to
do their jobs and protect our country.
This means more technology, more per-
sonnel, and more barriers.
In conclusion, I want to say thank
you to the women and men who protect
our border. Their job isn’t easy, but I
will say this today: The best—and I
mean the very best—are in our mili-
tary uniforms around the world and
doing our business, they are our Border
Patrol people, who are protecting our
border every day and night on our
southern border here in the United
States. We appreciate what you all do.
God bless you.

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CUYAHOGA RIVER
BURNING
Mr. BROWN. Fifty years ago this
Saturday, in Cleveland, OH, about 7
miles from where my wife and I now
live, sparks from a railcar traveling
over the Cuyahoga River near Lake
Erie ignited debris in the water below,
lighting our river on fire for what
would be the last time. It wasn’t the
first time the river had burned. It
wasn’t the biggest fire ever on the
river, but it surely had the most im-
pact.
Soon after that fire, Time magazine
published a story calling the Cuyahoga
River one of the worst rivers in the
country. It was hard even for us who
live in Ohio to argue otherwise.
I remember how polluted the river
was and the lake was when I was grow-
ing up. Even to a child, it was obvious
that most of what was in the river
didn’t belong in that river. Industry
used the river as an open sewer, and oil
coated the Cuyahoga River.
We knew that for generations Ohio’s
industry powered our country, making
the steel that won our wars, built our
skyscrapers, and went into the cars
and trucks that carried our products
and workers around the country. But
our river—the Cuyahoga River—paid
the price.
The city’s own wastewater system
was outdated and ill-equipped for what
was then America’s tenth largest city.
Americans were horrified by the scenes
of that burning river. It was a wake-up
call to people all over our great coun-
try that industrial pollution had real
costs.
People were becoming more and more
aware of the scope of our environ-
mental problems—polluted air, dirty
rivers and lakes, oil spills off our
coasts.
Citizens woke up. Citizens demanded
that their government take action. Our
mayor in Cleveland, Carl Stokes,
helped to lead the charge, pressing this
Congress for Federal help.
Congress passed the Clean Water Act
and the Clean Air Act. Congress cre-
ated the Environmental Protection
Agency. The country celebrated the
first Earth Day, and we made real
progress.
The city of Cleveland, the State of
Ohio, and citizen activists transformed

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4150 June 20, 2019
the Cuyahoga River Valley. Represent-
atives Ralph Regula, a Republican, and
John Seiberling, a Democrat, led ef-
forts to create the Cuyahoga Valley
National Recreation Area, which later
became the Cuyahoga Valley National
Park.
Think of that. There aren’t that
many national parks east of the Mis-
sissippi River—a national park in the
Cuyahoga River Valley.
Today our river is home to more than
60 species of fish. Families canoe and
kayak and fish. The industrial river
valley in downtown Cleveland, what we
call the Flats, has been transformed
into a center for recreation entertain-
ment.
NPR this week said that the cleanup
‘‘has been such a success that environ-
mental officials travel from around the
world to take notes.’’
All the cleanup we have done has not
hurt our economy—far from it. We
know the talking points. We hear from
lobbyists in this building. We know the
talking points we hear from corpora-
tions. They say that environmental
protections hurt businesses and kill
jobs.
The Cuyahoga proves them 180 de-
grees wrong. The river transports mil-
lions of tons of materials to and from
local industries and supports 15,000
jobs. It produces $1.7 billion in eco-
nomic activity.
For all that progress, more needs to
be done. Last week, I was on the shores
of Lake Erie and held a roundtable
with Ohioans who love this lake. They
told me they are worried that after 50
years of progress on the Cuyahoga and
across Lake Erie, the shallowest and
most vulnerable of the Great Lakes, we
are at risk of going backward. The lake
is threatened by harmful algal blooms
and by climate change. I thank Sen-
ator WHITEHOUSE for being the most
important Member of this Senate talk-
ing about that issue every day, every
day, every day. The lake is threatened
by invasive species, and it is threat-
ened by emerging contaminants that
are in our drinking water.
Unfortunately, we have a President
and an administration that deny cli-
mate science and that yesterday,
again, with their announcement, want
to give polluters free rein.
The President has tried every year to
gut the Great Lakes Restoration Ini-
tiative, which keeps our five Great
Lakes clean. Every single year the
President has tried to do that. His EPA
proposes leaving thousands of miles of
waterways unprotected. They have
abandoned the Paris Agreement—the
best blueprint we have to combat cli-
mate change.
Having watched for 50 years, first as
a young child, then, having seen what
has happened, having watched for 50
years the cleanup of this great lake
and the waterways in my State, which
is still an industrial State and still an
agriculture State, I know we can’t go
back. We can’t let our country return
to the days when our rivers flowed with
trash, sewage, and industrial waste,
and our air and water made our chil-
dren sick.
We can’t ignore climate change, one
of the great moral issues of our time.
Let’s honor this 50th anniversary by
committing ourselves to trusting our
scientists, protecting our lakes and riv-
ers, taking action to preserve our coun-
try for our children and our grand-
children before it is too late.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it
is my great honor to join Senator
BROWN of Ohio here on this 50th anni-
versary.
The image of a river aflame is en-
graved in our collective memory. For
Ohioans, for Senator BROWN, and for all
others who care about our water and
environment, the Cuyahoga River re-
mains a rallying cry.
Time magazine ran a piece in 1969
calling it this: ‘‘Chocolate brown, oily,
bubbling with subsurface gasses, it
oozes rather than flows.’’
No fish lived in it. It was too dan-
gerous for drinking or swimming.
‘‘The lower Cuyahoga has no visual
signs of life, not even low forms such as
leeches and sludge worms that usually
thrive on wastes,’’ a Federal report
said.
Virginia Aveni, captain of a vessel
charged with cleaning up, told the
Plain Dealer that the river ‘‘was a
complete gel almost of petrochemi-
cals.’’ There was a ‘‘sheen and thick-
ness of the river . . . . it was totally
jammed with downfall from upstream’’
and had ‘‘every kind of litter you can
imagine.’’
Today, waterfowl are back, and pad-
dlers enjoy themselves. It has been
named River of the Year for 2019. Fish
from the river are now safe to eat. A
river that inspired a generation to act
in the name of our environment has re-
warded that effort.
By the time a spark jumped off a
nearby passing train and lit the river
on fire in 1969, it was no surprise. The
river had burst into flames 13 times be-
fore between 1868 and 1969. This is the
most economically damaging fire, in
1952, which cost over $1.3 million—$12
million in today’s dollars.
An earlier fire in 1912 was the dead-
liest, killing 5 people.
What was different this time? Amer-
ica paid attention.
Of course the Cuyahoga was not our
only polluted waterway. The Potomac
River in Washington, DC, was, to de-
scribe it in Time’s words ‘‘stinking
from the 240 million gallons of waste
[that] were flushed into it daily,’’ and
‘‘Omaha’s meatpackers [filled] the Mis-
souri River with animal grease balls as
big as oranges.’’
Americans wised up to what we were
doing to our planet. We grew tired of
unchecked industries using our com-
mon assets as their dumps, and things
changed. It produced some of the most
significant environmental and public
health protections in history: the De-
cember 1970 establishment of the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency, the 1972
amendments to the Clean Water Act,
the Clean Air Act, the Lead-Based
Paint Poisoning Prevention Act, the
Ocean Dumping Act, the Safe Drinking
Water Act, the Resources Conservation
and Recovery Act, and the Toxic Sub-
stances Control Act. And, of course,
there was the big one—the National
Environmental Policy Act.
Each one had broad popular support.
Each garnered bipartisan support. It is
hard to imagine that today, but it hap-
pened.
The American people have made
hard-earned progress protecting our
waters in the last 50 years. We want to
swim in our lakes. We want to fish in
our rivers. We want to drink from our
streams.
We do not want to go back to the
days when rivers oozed, but the Trump
administration has the clear aim of al-
lowing industry donors to pollute more
and faster.
The price for this is paid in our riv-
ers, on our lands, in our oceans, and in
our climate. Right now, in our atmos-
phere and oceans, we are approaching
the kind of environmental catastrophe
that befell the Cuyahoga, only mag-
nified many times over.
Let’s ensure that the Cuyahoga did
not burn in vain and that the lessons of
the Cuyahoga River, Love Canal, Deep-
water Horizon, and other preventable
disasters are not repeated by us, now
on a global scale. We took bipartisan
action to protect our environment be-
fore. If we can break the devil’s grip on
the fossil fuel industry here, we can do
it again.
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF RITA BARANWAL
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I
have come to the floor to speak in sup-
port of the nomination of Dr. Rita
Baranwal to be Assistant Secretary for
Nuclear Energy at the Department of
Energy. Dr. Baranwal was reported
from the Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee without opposition
in both the 115th and 116th Congresses,
and I am glad we will vote to confirm
her today.
Over the past several years, the
United States has lost influence in nu-
clear energy to countries like Russia
and China. That is not a positive devel-
opment, but advanced nuclear tech-
nologies have the potential to reposi-
tion the United States as a leader in
the world market.
To achieve that, we will need strong,
experienced, and consistent leadership
at the Department of Energy. Dr.

Baranwal’s experience as the director
of the Gateway for Accelerated Innova-
tion in Nuclear, also referred to as
GAIN, provides her with an informed
perspective to push forward the re-
search, development, and deployment
of advanced reactor technologies.
Congress began to demonstrate its
strong support for advanced nuclear
through the enactment of two bills in
the last Congress, the Nuclear Energy
Innovation Capabilities Act and the
Nuclear Energy Innovation and Mod-
ernization Act. These new laws are in-
tended to facilitate reactor develop-
ment and streamline the licensing
process at the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.
In addition, legislation I have spon-
sored, the Nuclear Energy Leadership
Act, has garnered 17 bipartisan cospon-
sors in this new Congress. Our bill pro-
vides for the next steps on advanced
nuclear technologies, including the
need to ensure high-assay, low-en-
riched uranium fuel is available for
them.
We need a strong leader in the Office
of Nuclear Energy, someone who recog-
nizes the potential of these tech-
nologies, who will move forward so
that we can realize that potential and
who will work to restore the United
States’ leadership in nuclear energy. I
appreciate Dr. Baranwal’s willingness
to serve in this role and urge my col-
leagues to support her nomination.

sions from our powerplants. I am very

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4152 June 20, 2019
concerned about this proposed rule,
and I want to share some of my con-
cerns with the Members of the Senate
and the American people.
The Obama Clean Power Plan rule
was aimed at reducing carbon emis-
sions by 30 percent by the year 2030
compared to the 2005 level. It was a
strong proposal, but it gave maximum
discretion to the States on how they
could meet those targets. Those States
that relied more on coal-burning power
generation were given different stand-
ards than those States that had al-
ready transitioned to cleaner energy
sources. It was a fair rule, a tough rule,
and a rule that would significantly re-
duce carbon emissions in this country.
Powerplants are the largest single
source of carbon pollution, and we
know how harmful carbon pollution is
to our environment. Nearly 40 percent
comes from power generation.
We need strong Federal regulation.
We were moving in that direction
under the previous administration.
Now we demote the current emissions
standards to a mere suggestion. That is
wrong, and I hope that does not become
the case.
There are many reasons that we
should be concerned about this rule.
We should be concerned about what we
are doing about carbon pollution. Let
me cite a few.
In the area of public health, we know
that if we don’t control carbon emis-
sion, we will have more premature
deaths. The New York Times estimates
that there would be 1,400 annual pre-
mature deaths as a result of not prop-
erly regulating the carbon emissions
coming from powerplants.
We also know that because of the im-
pact carbon has on public health, the
failure to regulate it means more chil-
dren will miss schooldays because of
their respiratory challenges and more
parents won’t be able to work because
they have to take care of their chil-
dren. So the result is lost schooldays
and lost workdays because of the fail-
ure to regulate, which affects our econ-
omy and our educating workforce.
We know that children who are vul-
nerable to respiratory ailments, such
as asthma, are particularly at risk, and
there will be more days that they will
be confined to some form of air-condi-
tioning rather than being able to go
out in the neighborhood.
It is also a matter of our economy.
We know that clean energy produces
more jobs. That is where we are head-
ed, and the faster we get there, the bet-
ter it will be for our economy.
We also know, as a matter of energy
security, the faster we move in this di-
rection, the more secure we will be.
America has taken steps to wean our-
selves off of imported energy, but our
allies around the world are still too de-
pendent, as we know from the way Rus-
sia uses energy as a weapon. We need
to transition to renewable energy
sources so there can be energy security
for America’s allies.
Lastly, on the environment, carbon
is the major pollutant for nitrogen pol-
lution in our waters. I say that because
many of you have heard me talk fre-
quently on the floor about the Chesa-
peake Bay and the importance of the
Chesapeake Bay. It is a national treas-
ure. It is the largest estuary in our
hemisphere. It is critically important
to the way of life here in the Chesa-
peake Bay watersheds—six States and
the District of Columbia. We recognize
its economic value—$1 trillion to our
economy.
Well, 85 million pounds of nitrogen
pollution goes into the Chesapeake Bay
from the air. One-third of the Chesa-
peake Bay’s total nitrogen load comes
as a result of our failure to regulate
carbon going into the air. This causes
algae blooms in the Chesapeake Bay. It
causes dead zones. It makes it much
more difficult for the stakeholders to
meet their stated goals.
I am proud of the Chesapeake Bay
Program. All the local governments
have agreed on their responsibility. It
is tailored toward the States and en-
forced through the help of the Federal
Government. But because of this rule
change, it is now going to be more dif-
ficult to meet the goals we have set for
the Chesapeake Bay. It is not just af-
fecting the powerplants; it is affecting
our quality of life, public health, the
environment, and the economy.
The States have acted. I am proud of
what Maryland has done. We have
shown that you can clean up your car-
bon emissions through power produc-
tion and you can grow your economy.
We have done that in the State of
Maryland. We have joined with other
States in the RGGI—with Delaware,
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine,
New Hampshire, Rhode Island,
Vermont, and New York—and we have
shown a 40-percent reduction in emis-
sions since 2009. That is what the
States have done.
In the rule that is being proposed,
they are saying they are leaving it up
to the States. Maryland has done that,
but we are downwind. The progress we
are making is being negated by the pol-
lution coming in from the Midwest. We
need a national standard in order to be
able to meet our targets.
I would urge my colleagues, let’s get
engaged. This rule is bad for our econ-
omy. It is bad for public health. It is
bad for energy security. It is bad for
the environment. We can do better.
Let’s work together so that we have
proper regulation at the national level
dealing with carbon emissions.
I yield the floor.

VA MISSION ACT
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I
wanted to join with my colleagues this
week to mark the implementation of
an updated and streamlined healthcare
system that is specifically for our vet-
erans. This is made possible by the VA
MISSION Act.
In Tennessee, we have such a large
and vigorous and wonderful population
of veterans. I will tell you, we are so
grateful to them for their service, and
we are so grateful they have chosen to
make Tennessee their retirement
home.
One of our colleagues asked me one
day about how patriotic Tennessee is.
They had been there to visit. They saw
flags out in so many places. They saw
signs out that were ‘‘thank you’’ signs
to our veterans. I told them that I felt
like it was because we do have a strong
military presence. Fort Campbell is
primarily in Tennessee. We have
Millington, the air naval station. We
have Arnold. We have our National
Guard, and a couple of our units have
just finished a good deployment. We
cherish these veterans, and they are
such an integral part of our commu-
nities and our churches.
We have worked diligently on this
healthcare system for veterans to spe-
cifically meet their needs. That should
be the mission of the VA. It is not to
serve itself but to serve the veterans.
Once this new structure that is put in
place by the MISSION Act is fully im-
plemented, members of the military
community who have been, in my
words, neglected for too long—their ac-
cess to healthcare neglected—they are
finally going to get the attention and
the care they need. I use the term ‘‘ne-
glected’’ because anybody who knew
they were headed to the VA clinic for a
checkup knew that was not going to be
a quick checkup. There is a lot of pa-
perwork that goes into that process of
asking for that checkup and then see-
ing it actually take place.
I have heard from hundreds of vet-
erans, their stories and their experi-
ences. Sometimes you will hear them
say it was a comedy of errors. But it is
no comedy; it is a catastrophe of er-
rors. The consequences from this have
really taken a toll on the life, the
health, the safety, and sometimes the
sanity of our veterans community.
The reason you hear these stories is
because we have asked generations of
veterans to put their physical and their
emotional health in the hands of prac-
titioners whose hands were tied by ar-
bitrary rules and procedures that
turned even simple procedures into
what would be a logistical nightmare. I
have no doubt that if we went around
this Chamber and each Member of this
Chamber were to stand, they could—
without any notes, right off the top of
their head—give us a story they have
heard from a veteran. That should
never happen.
But as of this month, we have dealt
with a lot of these issues. We have re-
moved some of the roadblocks. And the
new Community Care Program, which
adopted elements from the successful
Veterans Choice Program, will con-
tinue to allow veterans to seek care
closer to home. What was once a clus-
ter of seven programs has been merged
into one single system—a whole-of-
health, whole-of-the-soldier approach.
It makes this process simpler and easi-
er to understand and to implement this
program.

Options will expand even more with
the authorization of local provider
agreements and access to walk-in com-
munity clinics, which is specifically
and precisely, what for years veterans
have said they want:
Just let me go to the doctor in my
hometown.
We have a neighborhood clinic over
here.
We have a clinic over at the phar-
macy, the CVS or the Walgreens. Let
me go there and not have to drive to a
clinic that is out of town.
One provision in particular that I be-
lieve is going to really make a big dif-
ference is the removal of barriers that
have prevented VA healthcare profes-
sionals from practicing telemedicine.
Any of us who have used telemedicine
and have Skyped with a physician
know this is a timesaver. It gets you in
front of the doctor in a more expedi-
tious fashion. It allows you to get that
advice to start taking and treating
your ailment sooner. It is a huge time-
saver. This is now going to be avail-
able.
As we are crafting these updates, we
are careful to consider the cost to the
patient and to make sure that veterans
won’t have to worry about receiving a
massive bill if they see a provider at a
local community facility. The VA MIS-
SION Act keeps costs at these clinics
in line with those at the VA healthcare
centers.
We have also taken steps to encour-
age consistent treatment at the VA
healthcare centers by providing the
funds necessary for these clinics to re-
tain top talent. You have to have
healthcare professionals in the clinics
in order for these clinics to see their
patients.
Most importantly, the VA MISSION
Act supports these changes via an up-
dated and extensive system of report-
ing and accountability. For years, this
body has debated the merits of various
healthcare regimes for children, the el-
derly, and the poor, but for some rea-
son, we have asked veterans to accept
a system incapable of providing care
without snarling patients in miles and
miles of redtape. For this, we owe the
veterans community an apology.
It is an honor to work with our vet-
erans and now say that the VA MIS-
SION Act is being implemented and
that care is coming to your commu-
nity. I think this reflects the sincere
desire to do right by our best and our
bravest.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska.
PLANNED PARENTHOOD
Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, we are
just a few days away from the first offi-
cial Democratic Presidential debate of
the campaign season in Miami, but for
anyone paying close attention, the
first meaningful debate is actually
about only 48 hours away in South
Carolina.
On Saturday, 11 Democrats, includ-
ing 4 of the top 5 in the current polls,
are going to take part in a candidate
forum hosted by the Planned Parent-
hood Action Fund.
What is Planned Parenthood?
Planned Parenthood is the country’s
largest abortion business. That is their
mainstay of operation. Last year,
Planned Parenthood reported commit-
ting more than 330,000 abortions—
somewhere between one-third and one-
half of all abortions committed in
America last year. Planned Parent-
hood’s president has said that pro-
viding, protecting, and expanding ac-
cess to abortion is part of the organiza-
tion’s ‘‘core mission.’’ It does this work
with the help of more than $500 million
in annual subsidies from the Federal
Government; that is, from taxpayers
across this country, many of whom be-
lieve that abortion is immoral. Yet the
position of Planned Parenthood is and
has long been abortion at any time,
anywhere, for any reason for free. That
used to represent the most extreme po-
sition anywhere in the Democratic
Party. It was shared by only a very
small, hard-fringe portion of its elected
leaders.
Just to review some history, in 2008,
Hillary Clinton was still calling for
safe, legal, and rare abortion access,
and as she would regularly emphasize,
‘‘by rare, I mean rare.’’ Yet, today, the
radical things that the Nation’s largest
abortion business wants are basically
indistinguishable from the position of
every Democrat who is now running for
President—abortion at any time, any-
where, for any reason for free.
In fact, it is actually worse than this
because the position of every Senator
who is currently running for the Demo-
cratic nomination and of at least one
Governor is that a living, breathing
baby who survives an abortion proce-
dure can still be left to die after birth.
All seven Senators who are currently
running for the Democratic Presi-
dential nomination voted against the
Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protec-
tion Act earlier this year, and Gov-
ernor Bullock of Montana vetoed a
State-level version of that bill just be-
fore he entered the race.
As things currently stand, it is en-
tirely possible that the next Demo-
cratic nominee for the highest office in
our land will be publicly agnostic
about the moral status of post-abortion
infanticide—morally agnostic about
post-abortion infanticide.
Let’s be clear. These candidates are
wildly and spectacularly out of the
mainstream in American life. Over the
last two decades, Gallup polling has
consistently shown that a majority of
Americans are opposed to unrestricted
abortion access beyond the first tri-
mester. The Gallup numbers actually
show that well under one-third of
Americans support abortion beyond the
first 3 months, and a new NBC/PBS/
Marist poll finds that fully four out of
five Americans are opposed to all abor-
tion in the third trimester. That in-
cludes a majority of self-identifying
pro-choice voters. I want to say that
again. A majority of self-identified pro-
choice voters in America are opposed
to abortion in the third trimester. So
the polling of Americans is actually
quite different than what the Demo-
crats are going to pretend it to be over
the next 2 days when they talk into
their echo chamber.
What is even more important than
anything about public opinion is that
the Democrats are also out of step with
our fundamental American conviction
that all men are created equal—all men
and women and babies. Instead, they
are increasingly committed to the
proposition that some people are less
than human and are, therefore, dispos-
able. Sadly, though, the most radical
leftwing voices are winning in their
party’s echo chamber, and Democratic
candidates have now decided that they
must prostrate themselves before the
‘‘flush with cash’’ abortion industry.
This has consequences well beyond pol-
icy. As Democrats’ abortion positions
have become more extreme, they have
no longer sought to even persuade fel-
low citizens with whom they disagree.
Rather, they have become openly hos-
tile to Americans who disagree on this
great moral challenge.
My colleague from New York, for in-
stance, Senator GILLIBRAND, who will
be attending this weekend’s forum in
South Carolina, made her feelings clear
earlier this month in an interview with
the Des Moines Register. In promising
that she would appoint only judges who
would uphold Roe v. Wade, here is what
she said. Listen to this quote:
I think there [are] some issues that have
such moral clarity that we have as a society
decided that the other side is not acceptable.
Imagine saying that it’s OK to appoint a
judge who is racist or anti-Semitic or
homophobic.
[This is not an issue where] there is a fair
‘‘other side.’’ There is no moral equivalency
when you come to racism, and I do not be-
lieve there is a moral equivalency when it
comes to changing laws that deny women re-
productive freedom.
What? What are we talking about
here? Are you kidding me? Did you
catch what she just said?
According to a sitting U.S. Senator
and a candidate for the Democratic
nomination to be President of the
United States, holding pro-life views in
America is no longer acceptable. It is
not a fair position, she tells us. It is
the moral equivalency of racism or
anti-Semitism. Perhaps in the Sen-
ator’s next interview she will suggest
that pro-life Americans belong in a
basket of deplorables.
There is so much wrong with this
statement that it is difficult to know
where to begin. We could note the
plain, simple fact that it is not pro-
lifers who have an ugly link to racism.
Rather, since the very beginning, the
American abortion industry has been
intimately connected to eugenics. This
is the origin of the movement.
As Planned Parenthood founder Mar-
garet Sanger put it herself—and think
about this quote—‘‘the unbalance be-
tween the birth rate of the ‘unfit’ and

the ‘fit’ [is] the greatest present men-
ace to civilization.’’
Sanger’s racial opinions are a matter
of some dispute, but this part is clear—
that she intentionally targeted efforts
at Black neighborhoods in Harlem and
in the Deep South. Many of the people
involved in her efforts took things a
step further—going so far as to forcibly
sterilize African-American women
whom they deemed to be unfit to pro-
create.
We can also note that it is, in part,
because of this ugly history that,
today, Black women in America are 31⁄2
times more likely to have abortions
than White women, and in some parts
of Senator GILLIBRAND’s home State,
Black children are actually more like-
ly to be aborted than to be carried to
term.
We could also point to the continued
eugenic use of abortion—for example,
to kill children who have nonlife-
threatening diseases. In the United
States today, two-thirds of all babies
in the womb who are found to have
Down syndrome are aborted, and in
some parts of Europe, the rate is push-
ing 100 percent. There are public ad
campaigns in two nations in Europe
that celebrate the fact that they have
gotten rid of all of their Down syn-
drome babies.
Instead of going point by point, I will
just recommend that anyone who
wants to better understand this dis-
turbing history read Justice Clarence
Thomas’s concurring opinion last
month in Box v. Planned Parenthood of
Indiana and Kentucky. Yet, according
to my Senate colleague, perhaps Jus-
tice Thomas is one of those racists—
you know, one of those notorious pro-
life racists who is stalking America.
In their leftward lurch to become the
Planned Parenthood candidate, it is
not just that the Democrats who seek
this office are losing touch with where
Americans actually are on the hard
questions of abortion or with our fun-
damental American convictions, it is
also, as my colleague from the State of
New York has shown, that we are los-
ing touch with even how to do politics
like Americans, where you respect the
dignity of people you differ with and
argue about the ideas. You don’t de-
clare them an unfit and an unworthy,
unacceptable other side. Americans
have always had a genius for talking to
each other. In our constitutional sys-
tem, we set up debate fora like this to
be able to facilitate, channel, and ele-
vate debate—even heated, feverish de-
bate about really sensitive topics.
Our Framers held firmly to the prin-
ciple that men and women in their ex-
ercise of reason could come to agree-
ments by persuasion and by dialogue
even if it took a long time and even if
the topics were difficult. Anything less
than that would be a violation of the
basic dignity of our fellow citizens. Our
Founders knew that hard political
issues should not be resolved at gun-
point; they should be resolved by de-
bate, which starts by assuming the dig-
nity of your counterparty in that de-
bate.
We are watching that conviction go
by the wayside right now. Slandering
pro-life Americans as being, in effect,
Klan members and Nazis is just a way
to crush debate, not to persuade. It is a
way of saying that these people—peo-
ple like my mom, who prays outside
abortion clinics; people like my daugh-
ters and my wife, who have spent a lot
of hours volunteering at crisis preg-
nancy centers; and people like the
overwhelming majority of Nebraskans,
whom I get to represent, or Indianans,
whom the Presiding Officer now gets to
represent—are so morally repugnant
that they don’t deserve a voice, that
they don’t deserve to be treated like
human beings, that they don’t deserve
to be engaged in debate, that they are
not people you could possibly have a
reasonable conversation with.
This is crazy talk.
It is not difficult to imagine where
this approach leads. When we lose sight
of the intrinsic and inexhaustible dig-
nity of unborn children, we open the
door to abortion’s violence, and when
we lose sight of the dignity of our fel-
low citizens in debate, we open the
door to yet other kinds of violence.
I have spent a lot of time with pro-
lifers in my life, probably a lot more
time than most of my colleagues who
are going to be at the Planned Parent-
hood debate in South Carolina on Sat-
urday. I will tell you what you will not
find among these people is partisan
caricature. What you will find are peo-
ple who are passionately devoted to the
dignity of every human being no mat-
ter how small or how vulnerable or
what disease one might have been diag-
nosed with. You will find a lot of Amer-
icans, young and old, in the pro-life
movement who care deeply about
women who are in need. You will also
find a lot of enthusiasm for promising
in vitro surgeries and for scientific de-
velopments in ultrasound and neonatal
technology. You will find fellow citi-
zens who are ready to advance the
basic American commitment to life
through the tools of dialogue, persua-
sion, and respect.
The dehumanization of our friends
and neighbors, whether they are in the
opposite party or in the womb, de-
stroys our national life together and
our national conversation. On both
sides, we need to be constantly stitch-
ing back together that fabric that has
been torn asunder.
I suggest to the Democrats who are
heading to the South Carolina debate
this weekend to spend less time wres-
tling with each other in order to say
more ridiculously extreme, clickbait
things for high-propensity primary vot-
ers and spend more time listening to
the voices of their pro-life fellow citi-
zens. My guess is they will learn some-
thing, and our national debate will be
the better for it.
Thank you.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
BRAUN). The Senator from Oregon.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, Er-
nest Hemingway said that the world is
a fine place and worth fighting for, and
I couldn’t agree more. My colleague
from Delaware and I are here on the
floor to fight for that world, to fight
for our planet.
If you breathe in a lung full of air
right now—and I invite anybody fol-
lowing this to do so—hold it for a few
seconds, and breathe it out, the air
that you will have just taken into your
body, into your lungs, will have had 33
percent more carbon than when I was
born. That is a dramatic trans-
formation of the atmosphere on this
planet. It doesn’t matter where you go.
You could be doing this exercise here
in DC, back home in Oregon, or in
Japan. It is still 33 percent more car-
bon in a single lifetime. Because that
extra carbon is blanketing our entire
globe, it is having a huge impact—an
impact we see in all kinds of ways.
Back home in Oregon, there has been
a huge impact with the forest fires. We
had forest fires this year that started
in March. Perhaps you have seen some
pictures of walls of flames and fires in
Montana, in Washington, in Oregon,
and in California in the last couple of
years—smoke that has blanketed our
cities and our States for weeks on end.
This is not the norm. This is the re-
sult of changing climate chaos, and it
is not good.
We see extreme weather across the
country. We see more powerful hurri-
canes assaulting the Southeast. We see
more Lyme disease in the Northeast
and fewer moose because the ticks kill
the moose and ticks carry Lyme dis-
ease to humans. We see the slowest
planting season in four decades—too
much rain, flooded farms.
As of June 3, the Department of Agri-
culture told us 40 million acres of corn
that would normally have been planted
haven’t been planted.
Climate chaos is the greatest threat
humans have ever seen on this planet,
and it is happening for one simple rea-
son: We discovered fossil fuels. We dis-
covered that burning them could create
a lot of energy, and we could transform
the globe with that energy, but every
single time you use those carbon
sources, you put carbon in the air, and
now we have started to really damage
our own planet.
So what is the national response?
Well, under President Obama, we had
the Clean Power Plan—the CPP. The
CPP laid out a pretty ambitious vision,
an example for the world to follow, but,
quite frankly, it wasn’t enough. It
doesn’t accelerate enough our transi-
tion to renewable energy.
Just think about it this way: We
have been gifted with a fabulous source
of fusion energy. We don’t have to
recreate fusion reactors here on the
planet because we have it safely stowed
millions of miles away in the Sun.
That is a fusion reactor. All we have to
do is capture the energy that shines on
planet Earth, and we are in pretty good

shape. That Sun heats up the air and
creates wind, and we can capture that
same energy by capturing the wind.
We have geothermal energy, poten-
tial wave energy. We have to transition
to these sources and quit burning car-
bon, and we need an ambitious plan to
do so. We need a turning point.
Future generations will either cele-
brate the moment when we committed
ourselves to saving our planet or they
will ask why we failed, and right now
we are looking at failure. The rate of
carbon pollution isn’t going down; it is
accelerating upward. We are accel-
erating into oblivion.
When I was born, it took about 2 to 3
years to increase a single point of car-
bon pollution, parts per million. You
can see how this curve is now accel-
erating upward. Now we are at about
2.5 points per year. That is a huge dif-
ference.
We are kind of lulled into this false
sense of comfort. Well, don’t we have
more insulation in our buildings?
Aren’t we blessed with cars that get
greater mileage? We have appliances
that use a little less energy. Well, yes,
those things are true, but they are not
enough. Even with that, the curve is
accelerating upward. So we are in trou-
ble, but we do have some blessings in
this battle.
Solar and wind electricity have
plunged in cost, and the result is they
are now cheaper than or competitive
with fossil fuels. That is before you
take into account the massive sub-
sidies granted by legislative action to
fossil fuels. So they are actually cheap-
er, and that is before you take into ac-
count the externalities—the damage
that fossil fuels are doing to our plan-
et. So now we can really see that re-
newables are a complete win except for
the greed manifested through our polit-
ical campaigns to keep burning fossil
fuels.
It means more dollars in a few cor-
porations’ pockets, pockets of a few
really rich people who say that their
generational need for wealth—which
they can’t take with them to the grave
anyway—that generational need, they
are willing to sacrifice our planet for
all.
Now, they are not willing to bear the
costs. They are not willing to pay for
the damage to all the homes destroyed
by those more powerful hurricanes.
They are not willing to pay for all the
forests destroyed by the forest fires in
Oregon. They are not willing to pay for
the structures destroyed by those fires.
They are not willing to pay the farmers
whose crop is going to produce less be-
cause they had to plant so late. In
other words, they want the private
profit while planet Earth and the rest
of us bear the consequences of their
greed.
So we need a strong plan, and we
need it now. We need to have a clear,
robust response to transition to renew-
able energy quickly. So let’s build on
the foundation of the Clean Power
Plan. Let’s make this the turning mo-
ment in history that future genera-
tions can celebrate because we really
do have a very fine planet, and it is
worth fighting for.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware.
Mr. CARPER. While the Senator
from Oregon is here, I just want to say
he mentioned we have a very fine plan-
et, and God knows we do, but it is also
the only planet we have, and I think
for certainly everybody who serves in
this body—and maybe some of these
young pages will have the opportunity
someday to live on another planet but
probably not.
The President of France was just
down the hall 2 years ago. I am sure
Senator MERKLEY remembers it. Presi-
dent Macron addressed us on a variety
of subjects, but one of those was the fu-
ture of our plant.
He said these words. I will never for-
get them. He said: We only get one
planet, planet Earth. There is no plan-
et B. This is it.
He reminded us of our obligation,
really a moral obligation, to take care
of this gift from God that he has en-
trusted into our care.
It is in that spirit that I am pleased
to rise today with Senator MERKLEY
and other colleagues to speak out
against the so-called Affordable Clean
Energy rule that repeals and replaces
the Clean Power Plan from the pre-
vious administration.
As I said when this rule was proposed
in, I think, August of last year—and
our colleague, given where he is from
in America, maybe they say this in his
State too—but we have a saying here
that you can put lipstick on a pig, but
it is still a pig.
I said at the time when this rule was
introduced that the only thing that has
changed from the proposal to the final
rule is maybe a little more lipstick.
The Trump EPA rule promotes nei-
ther affordable energy nor clean en-
ergy. What it actually does is it at-
tempts to scam the American people
into believing that the EPA is doing
something to stem the tide of climate
change.
I think this poster probably speaks
well to that thought, but this proposal,
I think, is a failure of vision, and I
think it is an abdication of leadership
in our fight against climate change. We
need to fight this problem head-on.
The fact that our climate is warm-
ing, the fact that we have this extreme
weather, whether it happens to be in
the Midwest with floods, the Northwest
with wildfires the size of my State,
whether it happens to be in the number
of category 5 hurricanes that we are
seeing, extreme weather—literally
within an hour or so of here, Ellicott
City, where they have had two 1,000-
year floods in 18 months.
My wife and I were out in Palo Alto,
CA, last weekend for the graduation of
our oldest son from business school,
and the week before we arrived there,
he told us that the temperature in the
Bay Area, where I used to be stationed
in the Navy during the Vietnam war,
he said that the temperature reached
104 degrees. I don’t ever remember it
ever reaching 94 degrees in the years I
was stationed in Moffett Field Naval
Air Station.
Something is going on here, and it is
serious. I think we have a pretty good
idea what is causing this, and we need
to fight this challenge head-on.
The good news is this doesn’t have to
be something to divide us as a nation.
It doesn’t have to be something that
divides us as Democrats and Repub-
licans. It doesn’t have to be something
that divides us with respect to the rest
of the world. This is something that
should unite us.
There is an old saying that the
enemy of my enemy is my friend. Well,
the enemy of a world that has all this
crazy weather, extreme weather—and
maybe in a lot of places in the internal
part of our country you don’t see what
we see. What we see is that my State is
sinking. Delaware is the lowest lying
State in America. We are sinking, and
the seas around us are rising. That is
not a very good combination.
Folks who don’t happen to live on
our coast—I was born in West Virginia,
grew up in other parts of the country,
but for us it is real. It is not just some-
thing that is esoteric. We see it every
day.
The science behind climate change is,
I believe, settled. Climate change is
real. It is happening. It is a growing
threat to our country, and it is getting
worse every year.
Climate change is leading to rising
global temperatures, rising sea levels,
more frequent and severe weather
events such as hurricanes, rainfall
measured by the foot, not by the inch,
and drought-fueled wildfires, as I said
earlier, the size of my State.
The more I hear about these extreme
weather events, the more I am re-
minded of the story in the Old Testa-
ment. I think it is in the book of Exo-
dus, where you may recall that Moses
gets a call from on high to lead the
people of Israel out of Egypt where
they are in bondage.
He tells God: God, I am not a very
good public speaker, and I don’t think
you have the right guy to do this.
The Lord said to him: You have a
brother, Aaron, who is a real good
speaker, a real good talker. Why don’t
the two of you sort of lead this effort
together?
So, urged by the Almighty, the two
brothers visited the pharaoh who was
running the show in Egypt. They called
on him and said: We are here to ask
you to let our people go. Set us free.
Pharaoh was stubborn. He rejected
their plea, and there were consequences
to that rejection. I think there were
about 10 different plagues that were
brought to bear on Egypt in an effort
to try to convince the pharaoh to let
the people go, like the hordes of locusts
that covered the land.
Moses and Aaron would go back to
see the pharaoh and would say: We

want you to let our people go. The
pharaoh would say, basically: Get out
of here.
Then, after that, snakes would come
out and appear everywhere, all over the
land.
They would go back and see the phar-
aoh, and he would say: Get out of here.
Lizards came out of the rivers and
covered the land, and they went back
to see the pharaoh, and he said: Get out
of here.
Finally, the river was turned to
blood, and they went back to see him,
and he said: Get out of here.
Finally, after the 10th plague, he
changed his tune. The 10th plague, as
you may recall, if you remember the
Old Testament—the 10th plague was
the firstborn sons of every Egyptian
family died.
That time when Moses and Aaron
showed up to see the pharaoh, he said:
Why don’t you leave. Take all your
people and your stuff and just leave,
and they left—and they left.
Our President’s dismissal of the ex-
treme weather that is associated with
the unrelenting worsening reality of
climate change reminds me of the
pharaoh’s dismissal of the plagues un-
leashed on the people of Israel 2,000
years ago.
The pharaoh was dismissive. This
President is dismissive. We have seen
this movie before. In this movie
version of it, our President is playing
the role of pharaoh, and we need to
make sure we don’t succumb to that.
The Obama-Biden administration fi-
nalized the Clean Power Plan to reduce
carbon pollution and try to stem the
tide of climate change.
The Clean Power Plan established
the very first Federal targets to reduce
carbon emissions from our Nation’s
electric powerplants, which at the time
were the largest source of carbon pollu-
tion in our country not that long ago.
The rule was not developed on a
whim. The Clean Power Plan was final-
ized after a lengthy rulemaking proc-
ess, which was 2 years or longer in the
making. They considered over 3.5 mil-
lion public comments, and I am told
they responded to every one of them.
The Clean Power Plan set real carbon
reduction targets for each State but
gave flexibility and time for States to
meet these individualized standards.
EPA estimated the Clean Power Plan
would have achieved over $54 billion—
that is billion with a ‘‘b’’—in health
and climate benefits if fully imple-
mented. The Clean Power Plan pro-
vided long-term certainty for U.S. busi-
nesses, helping American companies
make smart investments at home and
compete in the global energy market
around the world.
When finalized, critics of the Clean
Power Plan—and there were plenty of
them—argued the plan’s carbon targets
were too ambitious. That is only about
4 or 5 years ago. Critics swore that
every American consumer who relies
on electricity to keep the lights on
would soon be in dire straits. Adminis-
trator Wheeler echoed these false
claims just yesterday. Today, we know
just how wrong the Clean Power Plan
critics were.
Even though the Clean Power Plan
was never fully implemented, States
and utilities went ahead and started
making investments in order to meet
the plan’s carbon standards. They
began acting in a way that said: We be-
lieve this is the way we are actually
going to go as a country, and we need
to get onboard.
As with other clean air regulations,
America’s utilities have been able to
find ways to meet the carbon reduction
targets faster and much cheaper than
originally estimated. When George
Herbert Walker Bush was President, he
pushed for a cap-and-trade approach to
reducing acid rain in the northeastern
part of our country. It was killing all
of our forests, and he came up with a
plan to reduce acid rain cap and trade.
People said: It is going to cost too
much; it is going to take too long. At
the end of the day, it cost less than
half of what it was supposed to cost,
and I think it was accomplished in
about one-third of the time.
Today, our Nation’s utilities are al-
ready on track to meet and surpass the
goals set by the Clean Power Plan way
ahead of schedule—not on schedule but
way ahead of schedule—because even
though the Clean Power Plan was held
up in court, it sent clear signals to the
utility industry of this country.
All the while, the vast majority of
Americans are now enjoying lower util-
ities—let me say that again. They are
enjoying lower utility bills, not higher,
and more than 3 million Americans are
now going to work in the clean energy
sector every day, which includes jobs
in renewable energy generation and en-
ergy efficiency.
Despite the revolutionary changes in
our energy sector, leading climate sci-
entists are now telling us that we need
to do even more to protect American
lives and our economy from the threats
of climate change.
In the past year alone, the UN Inter-
governmental Panel on Climate
Change issued an alarming report that
concluded that if the global commu-
nity does not enact ‘‘rapid and far-
reaching’’ carbon reduction policies in
the next decade, we could face irrevers-
ible damage to our planet as soon as
2040.
Just 6 months ago, 13 Federal agen-
cies under the Trump administration
concluded unanimously that if this
country does not take more drastic ac-
tions to address climate change, every
major sector of our economy could be
negatively affected by climate change
by the turn of the century—every one.
Some sectors are expected to see hun-
dreds of billions of dollars of loss every
year. My recollection is, in the last
year alone, we have suffered damages
from extreme weather in our country
that add up to hundreds of billions of
dollars in 1 year alone.
What a science-based agency like
EPA should be doing is building off of
Obama’s forward-looking carbon reduc-
tion vision and strengthening the
Clean Power Plan standards, not weak-
ening them. But even though utilities
are on track to meet carbon reduction
targets and scientists are warning us
to keep our foot on the gas pedal, the
Trump administration, sadly, is hitting
the brakes.
What this EPA has done fails to heed
the warnings of climate scientists by
weakening the Obama-Biden carbon
standards put into place almost 4 years
ago. The Clean Power Plan set clear
targets for States to achieve a 32-per-
cent reduction in greenhouse gas emis-
sions from the power sector by 2030.
Let me say that again. The Clean
Power Plan set clear targets for States
to achieve an almost one-third reduc-
tion in greenhouse gas emissions from
the power sector by 2030.
In comparison, the Trump proposal
fails to set any real carbon emission
standards for the power sector. It fails
to set any real carbon emission stand-
ards for the power sector.
This new proposed rule provides
States with a menu of options for mak-
ing coal-fired powerplants operate
more efficiently, allowing States to de-
cide whether to make coal plants im-
plement those options. This means
States could do nothing to clean up
their powerplant emissions—nothing.
Add it up, and the dirty power scam
fails to drive down powerplant carbon
emissions. According to EPA’s own
analysis, this rule is, at best, going to
keep powerplant carbon emissions at
status quo levels. At worst, there are
credible reports that show the scam
may well result in an increase in car-
bon emissions.
Like all climate change policies by
President Trump, the dirty power scam
also fails to advance the American
clean energy economy. Instead, this
rule tries to take our country back to
a decade ago, when this country relied
much more heavily on dirty coal gen-
eration. EPA Administrator Wheeler
even touted the dirty power scam as a
way to support more coal energy pro-
duction in the United States. But ask
any utility CEO or investor. America’s
future is not in dirty coal; it is in clean
energy.
As a native of West Virginia whose
family members once worked in coal
mines, let me say this. There are 50,000
people who work in coal mines in this
country today, and those jobs are going
down. Today, there are 3 million people
who work in sustainable energy and
clean energy and conservation busi-
nesses, and for each of those 50,000 min-
ers, we have an obligation to them and
their families. If they lose their em-
ployment opportunities because we are
moving to cleaner, carbon-free air, we
have an obligation to help them in
terms of transitioning and training for
other jobs that are available. We have
3 million jobs today in this country
that nobody showed up to do because
they don’t have the skills, the edu-
cation, or the desire to do those jobs.

June 20, 2019
Coal miners could do a number of jobs.
People who work in coal mines could
build windmills. They could build solar
fields. They can do all kinds of stuff.
They can build clean corridors for our
transportation, fueling electric-pow-
ered vehicles across the highways
across America. They could build hy-
drogen fueling stations. They can do
all kinds of stuff.
Today, our utilities are making in-
vestments that will last 40 to 60 years,
if not longer. We should be providing
the right market signals today for a
clean energy economy tomorrow.
The dirty power scam doesn’t do
that. What it does is create business
uncertainty for our Nation’s utilities
and States grappling with the effects of
climate change.
To recap, if I could, the dirty power
scam does three things, regrettably: It
fails to heed the warnings of climate
scientists; it fails to drive down power-
plant carbon emissions; and it fails to
advance a clean energy economy.
Referring again to the failure of vi-
sion and leadership, that is why the
dirty power scam is a failure of vision
and an abdication of leadership in our
fight against climate change. Repeal-
ing the Clean Power Plan and replacing
it with a rule as ill-conceived as the
dirty power scam will have serious con-
sequences for the health of the public,
our economy, and our planet. It is also
a clear retreat from the EPA’s respon-
sibility to tackle the greatest environ-
mental crises we face on our planet
today, and those are climate change
and the extreme weather that flows
from it.
The people of this country deserve a
strong economy. They deserve more job
creation. They deserve cleaner air.
They deserve better environmental
quality. The American people and our
neighbors around the world deserve a
healthy planet that we can call home.
The American people deserve better
than the dirty power scam, plain and
simple.
My colleagues and I are going to do
everything in our power to make sure
that the people of this country ulti-
mately get the climate protection they
deserve.
The last thing I would say before
yielding back to Senator MERKLEY is
that the issue of climate change is not
something that should divide us. Ulti-
mately, this is something that should
unite us, not just within this body, not
just within this country, but around
the world. That is my hope and prayer
because, at the end of the day, we can
clean our air, we can clean our water,
we can combat climate change, and we
can create a lot of jobs—a lot more
than the 3 million jobs we have already
seen created.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon.
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, each
year we have a debate on the National
Defense Authorization Act. In the past,
it was a real debate—a debate for
which people brought significant issues
to the floor related to American na-
tional security. Their amendments
were considered. We argued pro and
con. We took votes. We lobbied our col-
leagues within our caucus or across the
aisle with the wisdom of our viewpoint.
That is a tradition; that is a practice;
that is what this Chamber is all
about—to take on the issues that we
face as a Nation, wrestle with them,
explore the pros and cons, find their
strengths or weaknesses, sometimes
come to compromises that take several
viewpoints, and merge them together
into an even stronger point of view.
But I am deeply disturbed that the U.S.
Senate is quickly losing the ability to
consider the issues facing our Nation.
My colleague just spoke about the
challenge of climate pollution, and I
appreciate his doing so. But we have
had few determined efforts to address
the ideas different Members have for
taking on that challenge, despite its
devastation to so many ways and dif-
ferent parts of our country.
When it comes to the security of our
country, no issue is more important
than the question of going to war. Our
Founders realized this is a decision
that should never be vested in a single
person, not even the President. They
knew that a single individual might
find political cause or corrupt purposes
to make the decision to go to combat
against a force and that such a decision
should be debated in a Chamber like
this and a Chamber like the House.
That is why the Constitution gives to
this body, the legislature of the United
States of America, the power to go to
war.
It is a question that came up early in
our history. There was a challenge that
we had off the Barbary Coast with cor-
sairs, who are often referred to as pi-
rates, taking charge of American brigs
and holding them hostage.
Jefferson embraced the idea of going
to war. He became President in 1801.
Alexander Hamilton wanted to remind
him what the Constitution said. As he
said, ‘‘It belongs to Congress only to go
to war.’’ Any one of us should be able
to pull out our pocket Constitutions,
read article I, section 8—that delib-
erate delegation to this Chamber and
the House to make that decision.
Well, right now we are in the drum-
beat of war with Iran. There has been a
lot of animosity between our two coun-
tries for a long period of time. The
United States mounted a campaign
through the Central Intelligence Agen-
cy to take out the directly elected
leadership of Iran in 1953—a CIA-staged
coup—and to install a leader, the Shah
of Iran, who operated with great, shall
I say, violence against the people. He
had a secret police that was as feared
as any in the world.
There were other points of animosity
when the people of Iran rose up against
that Shah and took hostage Ameri-
cans. They kept them hostage for a
great length of time during the Carter
administration. They did not release
them until President Reagan came into
office.
Then there was the Iraq-Iran war, a
war in which hundreds of thousands of
people in Iran died, and the United
States assisted the Iraqis in that war
against Iran. Well, we have had often
no love lost between our two nations
over this period of time.
I mention these few points of history
to say that each side nurtures its
grievances against the other, but some-
thing remarkable happened under the
last administration. They worked to
coordinate pressure from the entire
world to strike a deal with Iran, to end
their nuclear program, end the risk of
Iran becoming a nuclear power. This
agreement was something bought into
by Russia and China, the European
powers, and the United States. They
did many concrete things, things that
their rightwing did not like: disman-
tling their plutonium reactor, shipping
enriched uranium out of their country,
shutting down their centrifuges, allow-
ing a massive amount of inspectors
into their country to watch everything
that they were doing.
In return, the deal was we would help
them economically find a better stand-
ard of living. This is a moment of po-
tential turning point in the relation-
ship—this long animosity between the
two countries—potentially a win-win,
but then comes in a new administra-
tion, the Trump administration, and
they don’t like this possibility, this
deal. The President says it is the worst
deal ever struck. We, the United
States, pulled out of the deal on May 8,
2018—just over a year ago. Since then,
we have heard the drumbeats of war
echoing on Capitol Hill.
The administration designated the
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as
a terrorist organization and then pro-
ceeded to tighten the economic sanc-
tions in order to pressure the economy
of Iran.
So we had the end of the Uighurs,
who are partners of ours, to be able to
buy Iranian oil, greatly starving the
economy of that nation. Then we de-
ployed, in recent weeks, the Abraham
Lincoln carrier strike force to the Gulf.
Then we deployed a B–52 squadron to
the Gulf. Then we heard the advocates
in the administration saying: If any-
thing happens with a connection with
Iran, we will show them the ferocity of
our forces. We will respond and show
them not to mess with the United
States of America.
Different officials cited different ex-
amples, but one was: If an Iranian mili-
tia in Iraq should happen to harm an
American, that could be a trigger or if
Iran were to disrupt the movement of
oil from the Gulf, that could be a trig-
ger.
When you deploy forces and then
start looking for triggers, you can find
one for war, if you want, but I stand
here today to quote the Constitution of
the United States of America, and that
Constitution says the power of war

rests with this body—not the Oval Of-
fice.
As we have pressured Iran, we have
had incidents occur that have been
highlighted in recent days. Some mines
were put on the side of a couple ships—
blew a hole through the side, didn’t
sink the ships. The administration is
pretty sure, they say, that Iran did
this. Well, I always exercise some cau-
tion. We all remember the Iraq war. We
remember that the administration
then—the Bush administration—built
what they said was a powerful case of
weapons of mass destruction being cul-
tivated by Saddam Hussein and the
Iraq Government. We went to war on
that evidence, and we were wrong.
Here we are at this moment and an
administration that has predeployed
forces, is squeezing the Iranian people
as powerfully as possible. What hap-
pens in this situation? What is the
goal? Some in the administration say
the goal is negotiations. Now, let me
get this straight. The United States
broke the deal, strengthening the far
right in Iran which said don’t trust the
Americans. We strengthened the Revo-
lutionary Guard because the Revolu-
tionary Guard did not like the deal to
begin with. Then we economically
squeezed the people of Iran, creating
great hardship throughout the land—
meaning we have moved the entire pop-
ulation in the direction of supporting
the far right in that country.
Now, take these two things. We have
strengthened not the moderates who
want to see the nation on a different
course but the far right. Then we have
alienated much of the country and in-
creased their support for the far right,
and we have shown that when we sign
a deal, we don’t stand behind the deal
because this administration broke the
deal. How is that a foundation for ne-
gotiation? We are saying to Iran: We
negotiated. You agreed, but we are
breaking the deal, and now we want to
negotiate again.
People don’t tend to want to nego-
tiate with folks who have broken the
previous deal. So we here see that we
have a challenge in which we stand on
the precipice of potential war.
My colleague from New Mexico has
an amendment that restates the fun-
damentals of our Constitution, and he
has teamed up with my colleague from
Virginia who is here on the floor as
well, and I am certainly completely
supportive of their effort. They are
saying that while we are on this bill,
on security, on Defense authorization,
this is a moment we should be debating
whether the President has the author-
ity to go to war, and their amendment
says: No, he does not. He must follow
the Constitution, and he must come to
this body for authorization. That is an
important message for us to send. We
must not leave the debate on Defense
authorization without debating the
Udall-King amendment.
My colleagues are here to speak to it
in greater detail. I so much appreciate
their work. This is a moment that this
Chamber must rise to the challenge of
being a force that can wrestle with
great issues before us, and there is no
more important security issue at this
moment than debating whether the
President has the power to go to war. I
stand with the Constitution. I hope my
colleagues will all stand with the Con-
stitution in this Chamber. Thank you.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia.
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I also rise
today with my colleagues to talk about
the rumors of war we have been hear-
ing in this body and in the news. I want
to advocate for a very simple amend-
ment whose timing is, I think, pro-
pitious as we discuss the National De-
fense Authorization Act. Why wouldn’t
we discuss what we are hearing from
the White House and others? Why
wouldn’t we discuss the events that are
happening on the ground in the Strait
of Hormuz in the Middle East?
The amendment Senator UDALL has
prepared that is a bipartisan amend-
ment that is before the body—and we
hope for a vote early next week—is a
straightforward one. No funds would be
used to prosecute a war against Iran
unless this Congress has a vote to au-
thorize it, to authorize such a war. As
my colleague from Oregon mentioned,
that is what the Constitution suggests,
and that is the debate we should be
having.
Part of the reason I feel so strongly
about this is because I am a Virginian.
We are the most connected State to the
military mission of the United States.
All States are connected and all States
are Patriotic, but if you just add up the
kind of per capita in Virginia—our Ac-
tive Duty, our Guard, our Reserve, our
DOD civilians, like the nurses who
work at the Fort Belvoir Hospital, the
DOD contractors like the shipbuilders
in Newport News, our military fami-
lies—we are the most connected to the
Nation’s military mission. I am person-
ally connected to this with a son in the
U.S. Marines. So as a Virginian I feel
very strongly about this, and I also feel
strongly about it because we are proud
of the Virginians, Madison, Jefferson,
and others, who are among the Found-
ers who crafted the Constitution. They
tried to do some things that were pret-
ty revolutionary then, and they are
still revolutionary. Some of our Con-
stitution was a great borrowing exer-
cise—taking wonderful ideas from
other constitutions and laws and as-
sembling them together in a wonderful
document they put together in 1787,
but there were a couple of ideas in the
Constitution of 1787 that were not cho-
sen from elsewhere, that were really
unique to our country and are still
unique. One of the unique ideas is this:
War is not a matter for the Executive,
the King, the Emperor, the Monarch,
the Sultan, the Pope. No, war is a mat-
ter that needs to be declared by the
people’s elected legislative body.
That was revolutionary in 1787, and it
is revolutionary today. The balance of
power that was struck was that Con-
gress would declare war, and then once
declared, there would only be one Com-
mander in Chief—535 Commanders in
Chief would be a disaster. The decision
to initiate war would be for Congress,
and then the President, working in
tandem with military leadership,
would be the Commander in Chief to
prosecute a war if declared, but there
should be no shortcut and no substitute
for the debate in this body before the
initiation of war.
The amendment that will be on the
table—and then hopefully we will re-
ceive a vote on—that is bipartisan in
nature would prevent funding for a war
against Iran unless there is a vote of
Congress to authorize such a war.
The amendment does make clear that
no previous congressional act—for ex-
ample, the 2001 authorization—can be
tortured and twisted and stretched and
bootstrapped into a declaration of war
against Iran. The administration has
sort of been trying to lay that as a
predicate, suggesting that an author-
ization that passed in 2001 that did not
mention Iran would authorize war
against Iran, when not a single person
who voted for it in 2001 ever thought it
was to be used in justification for war
against Iran. The administration would
like to try to use that as a justifica-
tion, they have said, in testimony here
on the Hill.
Think about this: If they are so
afraid to come to Congress and ask for
an authorization that they want to try
to use something from 18 years ago,
what does it tell us about their con-
fidence that they have a good justifica-
tion that we need to be in a war?
The amendment we have does not
prevent the United States from defend-
ing itself from attack against Iran. The
President has the power as Commander
in Chief under Article II, and the War
Powers Resolution specifies that power
and doesn’t codify it. It doesn’t need to
be codified, but it makes clear that
power is always inherent in the Office
of the President.
Our amendment doesn’t suggest that
Iran’s behavior is acceptable or con-
sistent with international norms. I
have been part of many efforts over the
course of my time in the Senate to im-
pose sanctions on Iran if they violated,
for example, ballistic missile protocols,
U.N. sanctions, or rules, and if they en-
gaged in human rights abuses. The pur-
pose here is not to stand up and defend
Iranian behavior, but it is to stand for
the proposition that we shouldn’t be
committed to a war without a vote of
Congress.
I will say that this administration’s
actions and rhetoric have been unnec-
essarily provocative. It was the United
States that pulled out of a diplomatic
deal that was working, not Iran. When
President Trump pulled out of the dip-
lomatic deal at the time he did, his
then-Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson;
his then-Secretary of Defense, James
Mattis; his then-National Security Ad-
visor, General McMaster; his then and
current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4159
June 20, 2019
Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford—all said
that the Iran deal was working, that
Iran was complying with it, and that
the United States should stay in it.
The President pulled out of the diplo-
matic deal nevertheless and in the year
since has reimposed sanctions and
taken a number of steps that are pro-
vocative toward Iran—diplomatic prov-
ocation, rhetorical provocation, eco-
nomic provocation, and military provo-
cation.
We have been having a set of brief-
ings—some classified—from the admin-
istration on this. I am not going to get
into classified material, but one thing I
will acknowledge—and I am impressed
by this—is the administration’s intel
experts, when they brief us on the situ-
ation—even yesterday—they will state
that Iran’s activities are—and this is
pretty much a direct quote—in re-
sponse to the ‘‘U.S. Maximum Pres-
sure’’ campaign.
The ‘‘U.S. Maximum Pressure’’ cam-
paign that started with the United
States backing out of the diplomatic
deal is leading to Iran taking other ac-
tions that we don’t like, but they are
not taking those actions unprovoked.
Their actions need to be understood as
a response to the ‘‘U.S. Maximum Pres-
sure’’ campaign.
Senator MERKLEY talked about it. We
pulled out of the deal. We reimposed
sanctions. We designated part of the
Iranian Government as a foreign ter-
rorist organization. We misrepresented
routine military operations in the re-
gion. We moved more troops and Pa-
triot missiles and aircraft carriers and
other military material into Iran’s re-
gion. This is not their moving material
into our region; it is our moving mate-
rial into their neighborhood.
Just this week, the administration
announced the deployment of an addi-
tional 1,000 troops to the Middle East
to counter Iran, and that is what this
administration is doing—a ‘‘U.S. Max-
imum Pressure’’ campaign that tears
up diplomacy and thus raises the risk
of unnecessary war.
I will also point out that it is not
just U.S. activity that is provoking
Iran. When the United States allows
Saudi Arabia to get missiles they
shouldn’t have and when the United
States observes the Saudis building a
missile program—by public reports,
possibly with the support of China—
that is viewed as very dangerous by
Iran. When the United States transfers
nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia—
not even briefing Congress about it—
and the Saudis say they would try to
build up a nuclear arsenal to counter
Iran, it is a provocation. So the max-
imum pressure by the United States
and nations like Saudi Arabia are lead-
ing to an unnecessary escalation of
tension in the region.
I want to conclude because my col-
league from New Mexico, who is the au-
thor of this, also wants to speak about
why we need to take it up, but let me
just say this. I am going to state my
position for the record.
I think another war in the Middle
East now would be a disaster. I think it
would be catastrophic for the United
States to tear up a diplomatic deal and
then look our troops in the face and
say ‘‘Because we tore up a diplomatic
deal, you have to now go fight another
war’’ when we have been in the Middle
East for 18 years. I think it would rep-
resent just about as catastrophic a fail-
ure of American foreign policy as you
could imagine.
I think it would also have the dis-
advantage of taking our eye off the
ball. I have always been taught to keep
the main thing the main thing. I think
the main thing right now in national
security for the United States is to
keep our eye on our principal compet-
itor, which is China. When we take our
eye off our principal competitor and we
engage in wars we needn’t be in, China
will be the victor in that. That is a
very dangerous thing for us.
So I think it would be catastrophic
for the United States to be engaged in
another war in the Middle East, par-
ticularly a war against Iran right now.
But if the President feels differently
about that; if some of his advisers
think we ought to be about regime
change in Iran, as they have said; if
some of them think it would be easy to
beat Iran in a war, as they have said; if
some colleagues here on the floor think
we should be in a war with Iran, as
some have publicly urged, let them
come to the floor of the Senate, in full
view of the American people, and make
that argument.
Let’s have that argument right here
in the greatest deliberative body in the
world with the American public watch-
ing, and I will make my argument
about why a new war in the Middle
East would be catastrophic and see who
wants to stand up and make the argu-
ment that a new war in the Middle
East is something this great Nation
should do. And if we then have that ar-
gument and cast a vote and I lose, I am
going to be disappointed, but we will
have done what the Constitution sug-
gests that we must do.
Our failure to have that debate is so
unfair to our troops. It is unfair to our
troops to put them in harm’s way with
Congress hiding under their desk, not
being willing to state yea or nay on
whether we should be engaged in hos-
tilities.
Let’s honor the troops and the sac-
rifice we would ask them to make, fol-
low the Constitution, and have this de-
bate before the American public. That
is what the amendment would essen-
tially guarantee that this body would
do, and that is why I so strongly sup-
port it.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico.
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I thank
you for the recognition, and let me
thank the two Senators that preceded
me here. Senator MERKLEY spoke on
this issue of whether we should be
going to another war in the Middle
East, and Senator KAINE, whom I have
watched since he has been in the Sen-
ate, has been relentless and very con-
sistent about raising the issues of au-
thorizations of force and relying on au-
thorizations of force from 2001 and
2002—what we consider very outdated
in terms of looking at the facts on the
ground. I know he has been working
hard—Senator KAINE has—in the
Armed Services Committee. Both of us
have been working in the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee to try to address this
constitutional issue that is really be-
fore us.
I came to the floor of the Senate 4
weeks ago warning that this adminis-
tration’s reckless escalation of ten-
sions with Iran was blindly leading us
to the brink of war. I urged this body
to assert its constitutional authority
and pass my bipartisan legislation, the
Prevention of Unconstitutional War
with Iran Act. I called on all of us, Re-
publicans and Democrats, to make it
clear that the President alone cannot
wage war against Iran without author-
ization from Congress.
Well, here we are, 1 month later, and
tensions with Iran have only increased.
The threat of conflict has only drawn
closer. Today, we woke up to the news
that Iranian forces shot down a U.S.
drone. That comes on the heels of 1,000
American troops being sent to the Mid-
dle East. Yet the Senate does nothing—
nothing to assert Congress’s constitu-
tional authority and nothing to assume
the responsibility that the Founders
clearly placed on our shoulders, the
people’s representatives.
The Republican leadership should not
duck all debate on the military con-
flict with Iran. We need to vote. We
owe it to our men and women in uni-
form, whose lives would be put on the
line, to have this debate, to make the
hard choices, and to take the tough
votes.
Today, we are calling for a vote on an
amendment to the 2020 National De-
fense Authorization Act. The amend-
ment prohibits funding for military op-
erations against Iran without explicit
authorization from Congress. I am
joined in this amendment by Senators
KAINE, DURBIN, PAUL, MERKLEY, and
MURPHY. My related bill has 25 cospon-
sors and still counting.
Article I, section 8, of the Constitu-
tion couldn’t be clearer. It is Congress
and Congress alone that has the au-
thority to declare war. This amend-
ment recognizing Congress’s clear-cut
authority should have broad bipartisan
support. Whether you support armed
conflict with Iran or believe that the
war would be a disaster, you should
have the courage to cast a vote when
the Constitution says it is your job.
Let’s be clear. This bill does not tie
our Armed Forces’ hands. Our military
is highly capable, and we have an in-
herent right of self-defense, which this
amendment clearly underscores. But
we need to step up. The situation is
more urgent day by day.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4160 June 20, 2019
for the attack on two oil tankers last
week. Iran has denied that involve-
ment. There is a somewhat conflicting
report from the Japanese tanker
owner. I do not know whether Iran, its
surrogates, or another party is respon-
sible for this heinous action, but this
administration’s itch to go to war is all
too reminiscent of how we got em-
broiled in Iraq in 2003 and how the dis-
astrous tanker war of the 1980s began.
We must not make the same terrible
mistakes again. We do need to find out
precisely what happened and who is re-
sponsible, but the response need not be
another endless war in the Middle East.
We need a thorough and objective in-
vestigation of this incident, as has
been called for by a number of nations,
and the Senators need a real intel-
ligence briefing that covers sources and
evidence and not just a statement of
opinions from administration officials.
If the Trump administration is enter-
ing our forces into hostilities, then this
Congress should demand that a report
be submitted to Congress in accordance
with the War Powers Act. Those who
wrote that act made it clear: ‘‘Hos-
tilities also encompasses a state of
confrontation in which no shots have
been fired, but denotes a situation in
which there is a clear potential either
for such a state of confrontation or for
actual armed conflict.’’ We may have
already crossed this threshold. Some
have said we have.
The Reagan administration failed to
submit such a report to Congress dur-
ing the tanker wars, and the Congress
failed to hold that administration ac-
countable, despite the overwhelming
evidence of hostilities.
Now, the current administration has
hinted that it does not need to go to
Congress for approval for hostilities
against Iran. They seem to believe that
the 9/11 AUMF gives them legal author-
ity for war. Many of us in Congress
today voted for that AUMF, including
myself, and let me be clear—no one
who voted for it thought it would be
used to justify a war against Iran 18
years later. Congress needs to make
that clear before it is too late.
Yes, the Strait of Hormuz, the Per-
sian Gulf, and the Gulf of Oman should
be safe from navigation. Vital interests
are at stake. But I agree with the
statement issued by the U.S. Central
Command in the aftermath of this re-
cent attack:
We have no interest in engaging in a new
conflict in the Middle East. We will defend
our interests, but a war with Iran is not in
our strategic interest, nor in the best inter-
est of the international community.
A war with Iran is not in our stra-
tegic interest, and a majority of Amer-
icans agree. The American people are
tired of forever wars in the Middle East
that take our resources, produce no
strategic gains, and, most tragically,
endanger the lives of American men
and women.
In any war with Iran, we will have
few allies to back us. The international
community is not behind the National
Security Advisor and Secretary of
State’s bellicose rhetoric. We would
have to go it nearly alone.
The administration’s maximum pres-
sure strategy is supposedly intended to
bring Iran to the negotiating table, but
this strategy has predictably failed to
produce any negotiations or make any
diplomatic inroads. Instead, it is
emboldening the hardliners in Tehran
who also want confrontation.
The administration’s pulling out of
the Iran nuclear agreement was a co-
lossal strategic blunder. It was sup-
posedly intended to get the U.S. a bet-
ter deal, but violating our obligations
has only produced saber-rattling,
brinksmanship, and the very real risk
that a miscalculation or mistake will
result in an all-out war.
The United States and the world
were safer with the Iran nuclear agree-
ment. It included strict verification re-
quirements. The International Atomic
Energy Agency and the President’s
own intelligence and defense teams
agreed that Iran was complying.
The unilateral withdrawal only un-
dermined relations with our allies, sig-
naled that the United States will not
keep its word, and destabilized the
Middle East even more. This was a pre-
dictable result and many warned the
Trump administration about this out-
come.
Iran threatens to exceed the agree-
ment’s limits on nuclear fuel within
days. While I hope Iran holds to its end
of the bargain, the United States pull-
ing out of the agreement and reimpos-
ing sanctions has opened the door for
Iran to walk away as well.
Now we must do all we can over the
next 17 months to make sure this
President does not precipitously start
a war with Iran, a country of 80 million
people, about four times the size of
Iraq, and with proxy forces throughout
the region. A war would cost trillions
of dollars and undoubtedly American
lives. With each passing day and with
each incident, the risk of a cata-
strophic war grows closer.
I realize some of my colleagues have
a different view of the situation. Some
talk about how all options must be on
the table or say that the Iranian re-
gime must be overthrown. I hope they
reconsider and change their minds.
If they don’t, they should at least
have the courage of their convictions.
If you want to empower this President
to fight a war with Iran, let’s vote on
that question. The American people
and our men and women in uniform de-
serve to know that their representa-
tives will debate, discuss, and vote on
these most difficult of decisions. That
is why all of us in this body must de-
mand that this amendment be heard,
debated, and voted on. Senate gridlock
cannot be an excuse.
The Constitution puts this decision
squarely in our court. It is long past
time for Congress to reassert its war
powers authority. Our oath demands
that we make any decision to go to
war. The real possibility that this ad-
ministration will precipitate conflict
in Iran requires us to face this question
now. The fact that American lives will
be on the line places the moral impera-
tive on us to debate this issue and to
make clear to the President and his ad-
ministration that any decision to go to
war with Iran must be made by Con-
gress.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise
today to express my support for the
National Defense Authorization Act
and to highlight amendments that I
have sponsored or cosponsored to en-
hance opportunities for servicemem-
bers and their families.
The NDAA represents one of the Sen-
ate’s most important responsibilities.
It authorizes funding to support our
servicemembers, including those who
are serving in harm’s way. It sets pol-
icy for our Nation’s military and au-
thorizes critical national defense prior-
ities. It is vitally important to ensure
that our men and women in uniform, as
well as our Department of Defense ci-
vilians, have the training, ships,
planes, vehicles, and other equipment
they need to help defend our Nation
and its interests.
I commend Chairman INHOFE and
Ranking Member REED and the other
Members of the Armed Services Com-
mittee for their leadership and bipar-
tisan work on this important legisla-
tion. They have done an excellent job.
This bill contains many provisions
that are important to the State of
Maine and to our Nation. To cite just a
few items, I am pleased that the NDAA
includes authorization for three
Arleigh Burke destroyers, 94 fifth-gen-
eration Joint Strike Fighter aircraft,
and six CH–53K King Stallion heli-
copters. These essential ships and air-
craft will help to ensure that our mili-
tary maintains its superiority in both
the seas and skies. I also strongly sup-
port the 3.1 percent pay increase that
members of the Armed Forces will re-
ceive when this bill is signed into law.
In addition, the NDAA expresses our
commitment to key international part-
ners and allies. For example, the bill
includes a full $500 million authoriza-
tion to continue the cooperative mis-
sile defense programs with Israel,
which are becoming increasingly vital
in that volatile region. It also provides
additional security assistance for
Ukraine to help check continued Rus-
sian aggression on its eastern and
southern borders.
To build on the impressive work done
by Chairman INHOFE and the rest of the
committee, I have introduced amend-
ments to improve benefits for military
widows, increased access to and aware-
ness of Department of Defense and VA
apprenticeship programs, and improved
temporary duty travel lodging for DOD
employees, such as those serving at the
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery,
ME.

pleased to join my colleague Senator

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4161
June 20, 2019
DOUG JONES in sponsoring, calls for the
elimination of a longtime inequity in
the Survivor Benefit Plan and the De-
pendency and Indemnity Compensation
Plan. This inequity, which causes there
to be an offset between the two pro-
grams, is commonly known as the mili-
tary widow’s tax. This unfair offset is
currently preventing as many as 65,000
surviving spouses—more than 260 of
them in Maine—from receiving the full
benefits that they deserve.
The Department of Defense’s Sur-
vivor Benefits Plan, or SBP, is pri-
marily an insurance benefit that mili-
tary families purchase, usually in their
retirement, and it provides cash bene-
fits to a surviving spouse or other eligi-
ble recipients when the military re-
tiree passes away. On the other hand,
the Department of Veterans Affairs De-
pendency and Indemnity Compensation
Program, known as DIC, is a monthly
tax-free payment to survivors and de-
pendents of servicemembers who pass
away from service-related conditions.
For example, if a military retiree
pays premiums into the insurance pro-
gram, then, their spouse ought to be
able to receive those benefits when the
retiree passes away. However, what we
find instead is that if the surviving
spouse receiving SPB insurance pay-
ment is also eligible for the separate
payment from the VA, there is a dol-
lar-for-dollar offset. In some cases this
leads to the total elimination of the
Service Benefit Plan. In other cases,
the offset greatly reduces the amount
that is received. In either case, it is out
and out unfair, and it harms survivors
of our servicemembers and military re-
tirees.
I am often reminded by our military
commanders that you recruit the sol-
dier, but you retain the family. We
have an obligation to make sure that
we are taking care of our military fam-
ilies, who have sacrificed so much.
This problem goes back decades, but
this year can be the time that we fi-
nally solve it. With more than 75 Sen-
ators—three-quarters of the Senate—
and 340 Members of the House of Rep-
resentatives supporting this effort as
cosponsors of the stand-alone bill, this
is the year. It is our time to do our
duty, not only to support the brave
men and women of our military but
also to honor our commitment to their
families.
I would urge all of my colleagues to
join in this effort and to support the
repeal of the military widow’s tax as
part of the National Defense Author-
ization Act, and, indeed, Senator JONES
and I have introduced an amendment
to do just that.
Mr. President, the second amend-
ment I wish to discuss is one that I
have introduced with Senator KLO-
BUCHAR. It would authorize service-
members transitioning to civilian life
to carry out skills training, apprentice-
ships, and internship programs at other
Federal Agencies, in addition to the
private sector. Currently, the military
services are permitted to authorize
servicemember participation in job
training, including apprenticeships and
internships, beginning up to 6 months
before their service obligation in the
military is complete. In a recent report
to Congress, the Department of Defense
recommended that we expand this au-
thority to allow for inclusion of Fed-
eral Agencies as well as the private
sector as participants.
I am very grateful to Chairman
INHOFE and to Senator REED for re-
cently accepting this amendment and
including it as part of the NDAA man-
agers’ amendment. That will ensure
that these provisions are included in
the Senate bill. This is a win-win for
both servicemembers as well as Federal
Agencies, as this simple expansion will
create new opportunities for individual
members of the military and allow the
Federal Government to benefit from
the talents that our highly trained sol-
diers, sailors, airmen, and marines
bring to their careers subsequent to
their military service. It is a common-
sense reform that will expand access to
apprenticeships to our servicemembers
and ease their transition.
Third is an amendment that I intro-
duced with Senator CANTWELL. It
would require the Department of De-
fense, in coordination with the Depart-
ments of Veterans Affairs and Labor,
to report on their efforts to promote
the utilization of apprenticeships and
on-the-job training by servicemembers
transitioning out of the military. So,
obviously, this report is very much re-
lated to the earlier amendment that I
just described.
The dramatic underutilization of ap-
prenticeship and on-the-job training
under the GI bill demonstrates the
need to promote these vital programs.
In fiscal year 2018, fewer than 1,500 vet-
erans participated in apprenticeships
and fewer than 1,400 participated in the
other kinds of on-the-job training, and
that is out of a universe of over a mil-
lion beneficiaries of the VA’s edu-
cational programs.
One obvious benefit of apprenticeship
programs is that graduates learn
hands-on skills for jobs that will imme-
diately be available to them, and there
are many of these kinds of good-paying
jobs available in the State of Maine
and elsewhere today.
Finally, there is an amendment that
I have introduced with Senators SHA-
HEEN, KING, and HASSAN. This would
address significant problems that the
Department of Defense workers at the
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery,
ME, and elsewhere in the country have
encountered with the Department’s In-
tegrated Lodging Pilot Program, which
was initially authorized in the 2015
NDAA. The intent of the pilot program
was to save money by assigning TDY
lodging first at government facilities
and then at specific commercial lodg-
ing at prenegotiated rates. However,
what we have seen with employees at
our shipyard is that they are often
being forced to stay in subpar or incon-
venient lodging—sometimes, in areas
that simply are not safe.
Workers have shared stories with me
and with the other members of the
Maine and New Hampshire delegations
about being awoken in the middle of
the night to the sounds of loud shouts
while staying at required government
lodging, as well as more serious
incidences of robberies and shootings
nearby. In other cases, travelers de-
scribe staying in remote lodging on
military installations without security
or desk attendants nearby to resolve
standard issues that are ordinarily ad-
dressed quickly at commercial hotels—
basic things like dealing with room
keys that don’t work or addressing
other problems in the hotel rooms.
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, in fact,
has directed its travel office to no
longer use the Integrated Lodging
Pilot Program for travel to at least one
installation due to repeated problems
with personnel who were promised
lodging only to find that it was not
even available when they arrived, leav-
ing these workers scrambling to find
an alternative place to stay.
This was a pilot project that simply
did not work. It is for these reasons
that I have joined my colleagues from
Maine and New Hampshire in intro-
ducing an amendment that simply al-
lows this pilot program to end in De-
cember of this year as currently sched-
uled. This program may be something
worth revisiting after we straighten
out the problems with it—certainly,
after Congress reviews the still
uncompleted DOD report on the pilot.
But for the time being, it clearly has
not worked well for the workers at the
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and other
DOD employees, and it should be al-
lowed to expire at the end of this year.
I am very proud of the role that the
State of Maine plays in our national
defense. From the accounting center in
northern Maine to the Air National
Guard base in Bangor that refuels so
many military aircraft, to contractors
like Bath Iron Works, where we will
christen a ship on Saturday in honor of
our former colleague Senator Daniel
Inouye, to the Portsmouth Naval Ship-
yard in Kittery, to countless other
smaller suppliers, the State of Maine is
essential to our national security.
Enactment of this bill is vitally im-
portant to the security of our Nation. I
would encourage my colleagues to sup-
port the underlying bill, as well as
these commonsense amendments.
I yield the floor.

GUN SAFETY
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I rise
today to join my colleagues who have
come to the floor this week to call for
action to prevent gun violence.
On Tuesday we marked the 4-year an-

killed nine people during Bible study.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4162 June 20, 2019
Orlando, when an act of terror and ha-
tred took the lives of 49 people in the
LGBTQ community.
After each of these tragedies, we say
‘‘never again’’ and ‘‘enough is enough.’’
But after each mass shooting, Congress
fails to take action. The discussion
fades into the background until an-
other tragedy occurs, then this same
cycle is repeated.
It is unacceptable that Congress has
still yet to take meaningful action to
address this epidemic. The victims who
have been lost, their families, and
those who have experienced life-chang-
ing injuries and trauma deserve ac-
tion—as do all of our communities, be-
cause nearly every aspect of American
life has been afflicted by gun violence.
Nowhere is the impact of gun vio-
lence and the way it has changed our
lives more clear than in our Nation’s
schools. Just this year, a friend of
mine’s son started kindergarten.
Shortly after the school year started,
he and his other kindergarten peers
had to participate in a drill—what to
do if there is an active shooter or dan-
ger in your school.
At about the same time that my
friend received information from the
school that her son would be partici-
pating in a lockdown of sorts—a
lockdown for 5-year-olds—she read an
article by a teacher who had partici-
pated with her young students in such
an active shooter drill. When the
teacher got the kids still and turned off
the lights in the room so they could
practice staying safe, she noticed the
little lights in the soles of their sneak-
ers. You know those little light-up
shoes that children have? The teacher
wrote that she realized that if those
children came to school with those
shoes on a day when there was a shoot-
er, even with the lights down, they
would be targets. Well, needless to say,
my friend’s son no longer has light-up
sneakers.
It is time to finally meet words with
action. It is time to finally take steps
to keep the American people safe. It is
time to finally pass commonsense gun
laws.
A good start to address this public
safety issue would be to improve our
background check system. According
to the Department of Justice, since
1994 background checks have stopped
over 3 million dangerous individuals
from obtaining guns, including people
with violent criminal records, domestic
abusers, and those with mental health
issues.
But we know that there continue to
be loopholes in that system. Research
indicates that millions of guns are sold
each year to individuals without back-
ground checks. We need to extend
background checks to all gun sales and
ensure that people who are legally
barred from owning guns cannot easily
access them.
I have joined with Senator MURPHY,
who has been a passionate, dedicated
leader on this issue, on legislation to
do just that. Earlier this year, the
House of Representatives passed bipar-
tisan gun safety legislation aimed at
improving our background check sys-
tem. There is real momentum and ur-
gency on this issue. Strengthening
background checks is a measure that
the American people overwhelmingly
support.
Unfortunately, Republican leadership
in the Senate is more focused on put-
ting the priorities of the gun lobby
ahead of the will of the American peo-
ple. It is outrageous that some in this
body suggest that there is simply noth-
ing that we can do to stop the gun vio-
lence that has plagued our country.
The refusal to even bring up gun safety
legislation for consideration is uncon-
scionable. That must change.
I come from a State with a long tra-
dition of responsible gun ownership.
People across New Hampshire own guns
for hunting, sports, and protection. I
respect the tradition, and I am com-
mitted to upholding it, but I know that
the people in New Hampshire don’t
want dangerous weapons in the wrong
hands. They are also deeply frustrated
that Congress has refused to address
the heartbreaking acts of violence that
have become far too common in our
country. Granite Staters, particularly
our young people, are speaking out to
voice these frustrations.
Last year, I was proud to march with
students in Nashua who organized their
own March For Our Lives rally, and
students across our State have engaged
in everything from writing to public of-
ficials to staging school walkouts.
They are demanding that we take ac-
tion, and Congress needs to listen to
them.
I am going to keep pushing to pass
commonsense gun safety laws, and it is
long past time that the Senate finally
take this issue up for debate.
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO RECIPIENTS OF THE
CONGRESSIONAL AWARD
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President,
today I wish to congratulate this
year’s winners of the Congressional
Award. Established by Congress in 1979,
the award recognizes the achievements
of young Americans between the ages
of 14 and 23 years old and celebrates
their accomplishment in four program
areas: voluntary public service, per-
sonal development, physical fitness,
and expedition/exploration.
The award challenges participants to
set goals in an area that interests
them, encouraging them to pursue new
interests and grow along the way. If
they successfully achieve their goals,
they earn bronze, silver, and gold cer-
tificates and medals. Through the pro-
gram, these young Americans gain new
skills, earn greater confidence, and po-
sition themselves to be productive citi-
zens.
Today, recipients of the gold medal
will be presented with their Congres-
sional Award at a ceremony here in our
Nation’s Capital. On behalf of the U.S.
Senate, I would like to congratulate all
of the winners for their accomplish-
ments and for the example they set for
others. Among this impressive group,
my State of Kentucky is home to eight
gold medalists. Through their efforts,
the recipients of the 2019 Congressional
Awards are strengthening their com-
munities and our Nation.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that a list of this year’s recipients
of the Congressional Award Gold Medal
be printed in the RECORD.

LANDMINES IN YEMEN
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have
spent much of my career in the Senate
working to eradicate landmines, which
kill and maim far more civilians than
combatants. These insidious, inher-
ently indiscriminate weapons often re-
main active for years or even decades
after the fighting has ended and the
soldiers have left, lying in wait for the
unsuspecting footstep of a child on her
way to school, or a farmer working in
a field.
In 1997, the Yemeni Government
signed the Mine Ban Treaty which out-
laws the production, stockpiling, ex-
port, and use of anti-personnel mines.
With the help of international donors,
they made great strides in humani-
tarian demining, to the point that, by
2012, they were on the cusp of declaring
the country landmine free. Unfortu-
nately, the civil war between the
Houthi rebels supported by Iran, and
the Yemeni Government supported by
the Saudi-led coalition, changed every-
thing. The use of landmines made a re-
surgence, due to Iranian mines that the
Houthis have planted by the thousands
throughout the country. More than
9,000 Yemenis have reportedly been
killed or injured by landmines, the
overwhelming majority of them inno-
cent civilians.
Children are especially vulnerable to
mine accidents. They run and play;
they explore open fields; they are curi-
ous about strange objects. Most chil-
dren who step on a landmine will die
from loss of blood before they can ob-
tain medical attention, and the sur-
vivors often do not have access to the
specialized care and support they need.
Even children who do not become vic-
tims are affected by landmines in their
communities. They cannot play or go
to school without fearing for their
lives, and they suffer from malnutri-
tion when militants turn farmland into
minefields.
As I have said many times before, the
use of landmines is an affront to civ-
ilized societies. Regardless of who uses
them, they are an illegitimate weapon,
triggered by the victim, and are often
used to terrorize and brutalize the in-
nocent. They impede development for
decades, even generations. In Vietnam
today, for example, landmines continue
to kill and injure civilians 44 years
after the war ended. The Houthis’ use
of landmines cannot be justified any
more than their use of child soldiers
and other violations of the laws of war,
and should stop immediately.
Similarly, the United States should
stop supporting Saudi Arabia’s indis-
criminate bombing in Yemen which has
caused thousands of civilian casualties.
This war will not be won militarily,
and the longer it drags on the more in-
nocent people will pay the price, with
their limbs, their livelihoods, and their
lives.
The Department of State is sup-
porting efforts to help locate and de-
stroy landmines in Yemen, but far
more needs to be done. Even though

the Yemeni army, the UN Development
program, and nongovernmental organi-
zations have cleared more than 300,000
mines in the country, it is estimated
that at least 1 million remain.
The Leahy War Victims Fund, ad-
ministered by the U.S. Agency for
International Development, has pro-
vided artificial limbs, wheelchairs, re-
habilitation, and vocational assistance
to landmine survivors in many coun-
tries, and could be used in Yemen.
Yemen was an impoverished country
before Iran and Saudi Arabia decided to
go to war there, which has caused im-
mense suffering among the Yemeni
people. War crimes have been com-
mitted by both sides, and by providing
weapons to the Saudis, we also are im-
plicated. Every effort should be made
to pressure the Houthis to stop using
landmines and child soldiers, and the
Saudis to stop their bombing of civil-
ian areas. The Department of State
should increase its support for humani-
tarian demining in Yemen, and the
U.S. Agency for International Develop-
ment should increase its support for or-
ganizations that help mine victims re-
build their lives.
f
WORLD REFUGEE DAY
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, tomor-
row, I will be back home in Burlington,
VT, to take part in a joyous occasion.
In an afternoon ceremony at the Ethan
Allen Homestead, I will attend a natu-
ralization ceremony in which 14 new
Americans from 11 countries will be ad-
ministered the Oath of Allegiance. The
participants will be surrounded by fam-
ily and friends as they stand proudly
next to the American flag and formally
became U.S. citizens. It will be an
honor to stand with them.
As we celebrate these immigrants
who will join our ranks as American
citizens, today, on World Refugee Day,
we must not forget the plight of mil-
lions of refugees who have not been as
fortunate. Right now, there are over 70
million people across the globe who
have been forcibly displaced from their
home countries by the horrors of perse-
cution, war, famine, and chaos. In 2018
alone, nearly 13.8 million people were
newly displaced, meaning that 25 peo-
ple were forced to flee their homes
every single minute of 2018. Nearly half
of all refugees are children under the
age of 18, many of them just infants
and toddlers.
On World Refugee Day, we must re-
commit ourselves to the hallowed
American tradition of being a refuge
for the persecuted and the oppressed.
Welcoming refugees with dignity is not
a Democratic or a Republican priority;
it is the American way. We are a better
country for it. No single administra-
tion will ever be able to erase that
from our DNA as a nation of refugees
and immigrants.
I couldn’t think of a better way to
highlight the indelible contributions of
immigrants and refugees to our society
than to share a personal story that my
good friend, U.S. District Court Judge
Bill Sessions, recently offered at a nat-
uralization ceremony at Vermont’s
State House marking the 17th anniver-
sary of 9/11. Judge Sessions’ remarks
came just months after he suffered a
life-threatening injury, only to later
discover that the medical professionals
who helped save his life were the very
same immigrants he had sworn in as
American citizens years earlier.
I for one, am most grateful that they
were here in America to save his life.
I ask unanimous consent that Judge
Sessions’ statement be printed in the
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
STATEMENT OF U.S. DISTRICT COURT JUDGE
WILLIAM K. SESSIONS III, VERMONT STATE
HOUSE NATURALIZATION CEREMONY—SEPT.
11, 2018
I am going to tell you my story. Of course
I’m not going to tell you my whole life story,
just that part which relates to my injury and
illness a number of months ago. So on one
level I will share with you my story, my ex-
perience. But it really isn’t about me. It’s
about all those who came to my aid. It’s
about wonderful people who have recently
moved here to this country to pursue their
dreams, and it’s about what these folks do
for all of us.
I’ve been a federal judge since 1995, about
24 years. One of my favorite parts of the job
is to preside at naturalization ceremonies.
Over the years, I’ve had ceremonies, in
courtrooms, schools, museums, on boats and
in legislative halls. Currently, there are 24
such ceremonies performed each year in
Vermont, and between 700 and 800 people are
sworn in as American citizens. I do two a
year, aboard the Ticonderoga at Shelburne
Museum and in the State House on Sep-
tember 11th of each year. The State House
ceremony is very special. Patrick Leahy and
I organized the first such ceremony on the
first anniversary of the September 11th at-
tack as a statement that we cherish what
immigrants bring to this country, that our
welcome to new citizens will not be dimin-
ished by the acts of terrorists. It’s a large
group of between 60 and 80 applicants for
citizenship. We have held ceremonies on Sep-
tember 11th of each year ever since.
Naturalization ceremonies are joyous cele-
brations. The new citizens are from all over
the world. In fact these ceremonies often
evolve into celebrations of their own cul-
tural traditions. Many come in their native
dress, and all of their families share in their
celebration. They come up after the cere-
mony for pictures with me. My photo must
rest on hundreds of mantles.
There are a couple of themes that seem
universal. First, they are all very happy. For
many, this day is the culmination of a long
struggle. Many have come from refugee
camps in Bhutan or Nepal or war-torn areas,
such as Somalia or Bosnia. Some were raised
in Communist countries, including Russia,
China and the Eastern Bloc countries. Some
were from Central and South America, hav-
ing come here to escape violence at home,
and others were from Europe or Canada.
They speak about their dreams of America.
The American dream is so inspirational for
so many new citizens: hope, freedom, edu-
cation, employment. It is inspirational for us
who have lived here all of our lives to be re-
minded that so many look to this country as
a beacon of hope. And we are a multi-cul-
tural community. We take pride in our diver-
sity. The infusion of rich cultural traditions
is in many ways our lifeblood.
At the same time, naturalization cere-
monies mark transitions from their homes
and extended families to our community,
and that transition is hard. They bring with
them such rich cultural traditions, but often
they see in their children the influence of
the western community. Fernanda spoke to
this—you feel caught between two worlds.
But where do they go after being natural-
ized? There have been over 12,000 new citi-
zens sworn in since I have been a judge.
That’s a very significant portion of our
whole community. Yet I never understood
where they go. How do they integrate into
our Western culture? Just what were they
doing here that impacts all of us? Now I have
a much greater understanding of what they
contribute for all of us.
Now to my story. In late February, Abi and
I were skating on the frozen fields of Blue
Ledge farm, our daughter’s and son-in-law’s
property. I took a fall backwards, striking
my head on the ice. The sound could be
heard throughout the county. I gathered my-
self. I seemed to have a headache, but not
more. We skated back to the car. I of course
did nothing.
Over the next two months I occasionally
had minor headaches. It seemed like nothing
more than a distraction. Things changed on
a Sunday night in May. I had trouble speak-
ing. Abi wanted to take me to the nearby
ER, I said I’d visit a doctor the next day.
John Barstow called. He in his own blunt
way ordered I go to the ER. Two vs. one, so
we went Sunday night. A CT scan was done
and sent to the University of Vermont Med-
ical Center. A neurosurgeon reviewed it and
sent back the following message: I had mas-
sive bleeding in the brain, I was to be trans-
ported to Burlington, and he had scheduled
brain surgery for 4 that morning.
So I remember very well meeting the neu-
rosurgeon outside of the operating room. He
explained the presence of blood and the
movement of the brain from the pressure. He
then waited for my response, but I couldn’t
answer him. I could not speak, I couldn’t
make a sound. He was an older man, almost
a contemporary of mine. He put his hand on
mine and said in a very kind way: ‘‘We’re
going to make you all better.’’ I could only
nod.
I spent close to a month in the hospital, ro-
tating between UVM Medical Center and
Fanny Allen. One of my first observations
was that people who took care of me were
from all over the world. Those included
nurses, medical technicians, and support
staff. I just loved talking with them about
their stories. They all had such pride in their
cultural heritage. And they had such hope
for their life here in the United States.
One day one of my favorite nurses said to
me: ‘‘You probably don’t remember me, but
you swore me in as an American citizen.’’ I
didn’t remember her, but I felt an immediate
connection. The ceremonies were special to
both of us, and I felt a joy and a level of com-
fort that she was taking care of me. Also
there was such a sense of small world.
During my hospitalization I had a number
of setbacks that are common with this type
of operation. Those setbacks took away my
strength. They also impacted my ability to
walk and to speak. I began occupational and
physical therapy and speech pathology to re-
learn those skills. On the second day of
meeting my occupational therapist, she told
me that I had sworn her in as a citizen on
September 11th at a State House ceremony.
She brought the program for the ceremony
the next day. Yes indeed, I was the judge who
performed her ceremony. And in the course
of my rehabilitation, I met a number of
therapists, many of whom were either natu-
ralized citizens or were married to natural-
ized citizens. So the answer to my original

question: Where do immigrants go to inte-
grate into the community? Many go in to
the health care community.
But then how about the neurosurgeon? He
had reviewed the CT scan, ordered that I be
transported to Burlington. He scheduled sur-
gery at 4 a.m., and waited all night to per-
form the operation. And he was so kind to
me before the operation.
My follow-up appointment with him was
one month after the operation. Abi and I
went to his office. A CT scan was done,
which he showed us. The bleeding had
stopped, the blood was all gone, and the
brain had moved back to where it was sup-
posed to be, about 2.2 cm. He then said to
both of us: ‘‘You will make a full recovery.’’
As he was leaving the room, I said to him:
‘‘Doctor, thank you for saving my life.’’ He
stopped, looked directly at me and said:
‘‘You’re welcome. And thank you, Judge.’’ I
had no idea why he would thank me and
asked for what. His response: ‘‘On September
11th, 2006, on the fifth anniversary of the at-
tack on New York and Washington, at a
ceremony at the State House in Montpelier,
you swore me in as an American citizen. It
was a very special day for me.’’
So what have I learned from my experi-
ence? Immigrants bring to us their stories,
the richness of their cultural traditions. This
makes our community so much more diverse
and interesting. We all benefit so much by
their presence.
But now I look at the group being sworn in
as citizens in a different light. Among the
group may be nurses, medical technicians
and aides who care for us when we are our
most vulnerable; there may be therapists
and speech pathologists who work to restore
us who have been injured to our previous
health; there may be doctors and surgeons
who make life-altering decisions that may
save our lives; there may be teachers and
principals who care for and educate our chil-
dren; there may be civil rights lawyers who
defend our liberties, and police officers who
protect us in the community. With the ex-
ception of native Americans we or our ances-
tors made that same voyage, often with
those same dreams. We are them and they
are us. We need to welcome them, but we
also should thank them for all they do to
make our community a safer, healthier and
richer place in which to live.
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to
take the opportunity to join commu-
nities across the country and around
the globe to commemorate the 19th ob-
servance of World Refugee Day.
Let me start with two sobering sta-
tistics from the UN agency charged
with protecting refugees. The first is
that 25 people were forced to flee their
homes every minute of last year. The
second is that more than 70 million
people have now been forcibly dis-
placed by conflict and persecution, the
highest number the UN refugee agency
has ever seen. So suffice it to say that
the global need is real.
Which is why it is so heartbreaking
to see Donald Trump’s repeated efforts
to try and slam America’s doors shut
to the world’s most vulnerable.
It is particularly outrageous that the
Trump folks aren’t even on track to
admit their own historically low cap of
30,000 refugees this year.
Let’s be clear: Turning away refugees
isn’t some cornerstone of conserv-
atism. Ronald Reagan admitted tens of
thousands of refugees, so did George W.
Bush.
In another era, that would have in-
cluded my family, who fled Nazi perse-
cution in the 1930s, seeking sanctuary
in this country. I would have never had
the honor of representing my State of
Oregon here in this body had America
sent my parents away.
Now, Edith and Peter Wyden aren’t
exactly household names, but here are
a few that should be: Madeleine
Albright, Albert Einstein, Gloria
Estefan, Mila Kunis, and Elie Wiesel.
America is so much the richer for
their contributions to diplomacy, phys-
ics, music, film and television, lit-
erature, and more.
So there is a practical reason for ac-
cepting refugees: Doing so makes
America better.
There is also a moral reason for ac-
cepting refugees. Faith traditions
speak of it as a duty to repair the
world or to welcome the stranger. In
Oregon, we just call it the right thing
to do.
America is better than the adminis-
tration’s cruel and callous policies. I
remain committed to challenging Don-
ald Trump’s exclusionary, anti-refugee
policies on all fronts, and I challenge
my colleagues to do the same.
Folks are looking to the Senate for
strong, principled leaders. They want
more than rhetoric; they want results.
So I urge my colleagues in the
strongest terms to honor this World
Refugee Day by rolling up their sleeves
and working to revive America’s his-
toric, bipartisan commitment to the
plight of refugees around the world.
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, it has
been said many times before, but it
bears repeating today more than ever,
on World Refugee Day—ours is a coun-
try built by immigrants. We have a
proud tradition of welcoming for-
eigners to our shores.
The first European settlers in North
America—those who founded our origi-
nal Thirteen Colonies—were fleeing re-
ligious oppression and persecution.
Over the following decades, America
became, in the words of Thomas Paine,
‘‘the asylum for the persecuted.’’ We
welcomed Irish Catholics fleeing star-
vation and British rule, Germans flee-
ing political turmoil, Eastern Euro-
pean Jews fleeing the pogroms, and
countless others. Over the generations,
America welcomed Europeans dis-
placed by war, and later, millions of
refugees seeking political asylum from
Communism during the Cold War.
In 1980, we passed landmark legisla-
tion—the Refugee Act—which provided
a permanent and systemized procedure
for admitting refugees. This law estab-
lished the concept of a Presidential de-
termination on refuge admissions, by
which the President can set the num-
ber of refugees that the United States
may admit in a given year. For the
past 40 years, both Democratic and Re-
publican administrations demonstrated
a commitment to robust resettlement.
Prior to the Trump administration, the
average annual refugee admissions cap
was 95,000 refugees. Administration of-
ficials of both parties took seriously
the Presidential determination and
worked to maintain a resettlement
rate on par with it.
At nearly every juncture in history
since its founding, America has been
called upon to be a leader in welcoming
the persecuted. More often than not,
we have answered that call and today,
it sounds to us louder than ever. With
more than 24 million refugees around
the globe, America must step into our
historic leadership role, not away from
it.
Now is the time to increase the ref-
ugee admissions ceiling, not cut it.
Now is the time to build up our reset-
tlement infrastructure, not decimate
it. Now is the time to open our door,
not close it. But the Trump adminis-
tration betrayed the foundational val-
ues of this Nation by slashing our an-
nual refugee admissions ceiling to a
dismal 30,000 refugees. This was an un-
precedented low, both in number and
humanity. That is why I introduced the
GRACE Act. This bill prohibits any
U.S. President from setting an admis-
sion ceiling below 95,000 refugees each
year and requires administration offi-
cials to treat that figure as a goal.
We must not be silent. We must con-
tinue to meet the global crisis of dis-
placed persons head on, and like our
forefathers, we must extend a hand to
those fleeing persecution around the
word. Thank you.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO DYLAN WICHMAN
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this
week I have the honor of recognizing
Dylan Wichman, of Billings, for his im-
pact on the Yellowstone community
and surrounding areas.
Dylan, only a rising senior at Bil-
lings Central High School, earned sec-
ond place at the State Science Fair and
took first at Montana State Univer-
sity-Billings’ regional fair for his wild-
fire predictive and preventative algo-
rithm, FASTCAT. Dylan also partici-
pated in the International Science Fair
in Phoenix, AZ alongside 1,800 other
students from 80 countries. Dylan
earned third place in his category.
Inspired by the tragic Paradise Fire
in 2018, Dylan put in countless hours to
develop FASTCAT. FASTCAT is an al-
gorithm used to predict the size of
wildfires before they even occur, to en-
sure Montanans will be safer and more
prepared during fire season. Dylan’s ar-
tificial intelligence algorithm utilizes
a neutral network model, ensuring the
algorithms ability to problem solve as
more data is input and analyzed. His
innovative creation is an impressive
improvement in Montana’s existing
fire safety and prevention programs.
Dylan hopes to see his system imple-
mented State and nationwide and glob-
ally in the future. Dylan will continue
to work on his program alongside a
professor at University of Montana
next year.

TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL
DOUGLAS ANDERSON
∑ Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I
wish to honor BG Douglas Anderson,
who has distinguished himself during
his more than 37 years of service to the
U.S. Army and this Nation. Through-
out the duration of his career, Briga-
dier General Anderson has served in po-
sitions of increased responsibility and
trust, culminating as the commanding
general of the 9th Mission Support
Command at Fort Shafter, HI.
As the commanding general of the

ades.
During his tenure, Brigadier General

a tireless devotion to duty, a strong
love for this country and the soldiers

f
TRIBUTE TO PEG SEMINARIO
∑ Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as
ranking member of the Senate Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor,
and Pensions, I rise to pay tribute to
Peg Seminario, a fierce advocate for
working people with more than 40
years leading the AFL–CIO and the
labor movement in fighting for strong-
er protections and safer worker condi-
tions for workers.
Peg has led the AFL–CIO’s safety and
health program since 1990 and through-
out her career has played a leading role
in the fight to promulgate strong
health and safety standards pertaining
to major hazards facing workers, in-
cluding asbestos, lead, silica, noise, and
ergonomics. In fact, she has had a hand
in every major health and safety rule
adopted since 1977—almost all of which
were adopted since the inception of the
Occupational Safety and Health Act,
OSHA.
She has pushed Congress to protect
and enhance the provisions of the OSH
Act; to increase Federal funding for
critical worker protection Agencies,
including the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, the Mine Safe-
ty and Health Administration, and the
National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health; and worked tire-
lessly to see that first responders who
responded after the 9/11 attack and suf-
fered illnesses as a result received the
necessary medical care they need and
deserve.
I hope my colleagues will join me in
recognizing Mrs. Seminario’s distin-
guished career and thanking her for
her efforts to protect the health and
safety of workers in America.∑
f
TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL ASSANTE
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, today I
wish to recognize Michael Assante, a
leader, a visionary, and a patriot who
has contributed so much to protect our
Nation’s critical infrastructure and our
interests around the world.
Michael Assante began his impres-
sive career as an intelligence officer in
the U.S. Navy where he learned the in-
tricacies of cyber security defenses.
After leaving the Navy, Mike became
the chief information security officer
at one of the largest U.S. utilities,
American Electric Power. Mike contin-
ued to work in the private sector in the
field of cyber security before he joined
Idaho National Laboratory, INL, as a
critical infrastructure protection spe-
cialist. At INL, Michael Assante as-
sembled a unique team of computer ex-
perts, power engineers, control systems
technicians, grid operators, infrastruc-
ture designers, law enforcement offi-
cials, and U.S. military special forces
officers to tackle the most challenging
cyber threats to critical infrastructure.
This team has an impressive list of suc-
cesses and its work continues to this
day.
As Mike’s accomplishments and rec-
ognition grew, he left INL and assumed
senior positions at the North American
Electric Reliability Corporation, the
Council on CyberSecurity, the Center
for Internet Security, NexDefense, the
SANS Institute, and the Center for
Strategic and International Studies. In
all of these capacities, Michael Assante
brought unique insights and strategies
to the effort to protect our critical in-
frastructure from cyberattack. It was
during this time that Mike became a
resource to me and my staff, and he
helped us better understand the mag-
nitude of the cyber threat to our grid
and opportunities for engineered solu-
tions to interrupt the kill chain and
mitigate the threat.
As a result of more than two decades
of dedication, hard work, and impact,
Michael Assante has a long list of note-
worthy publications, collaborations,
recognitions, and awards, but perhaps
his greatest legacy is the thousands of
professionals he trained to help protect
our Nation’s critical infrastructure.
Most Americans, including Mike’s
family and friends, will never know
how much he did to protect U.S. na-
tional security interests. As a member
of the Senate Select Committee on In-
telligence, I can tell you that he is a
giant in his field, and our country is
safer because of his efforts. We are
grateful for his many contributions.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and
were referred or ordered to lie on the
table as indicated:
POM–95. A concurrent resolution adopted
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana
urging the United States Congress to provide
adequate funding to the United States Army
Corps of Engineers for the completion of the
proposed project to deepen the Mississippi
River Ship Channel to fifty feet; to the Com-
mittee on Environment and Public Works.
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 131
Whereas, deepening of the Mississippi
River Ship Channel to fifty feet is a historic
infrastructure project that is vital to our na-
tion’s economic prosperity; and
Whereas, the expansion of the Panama
Canal has made it imperative to improve ac-
cess on the Mississippi River for larger Post-
Panamax ships for export and import of
goods; and
Whereas, the United States Army Corps of
Engineers and the state of Louisiana desire
deepening the Mississippi River Ship Chan-
nel to fifty feet; and
Whereas. the project is approved and
awaiting federal funding; and
Whereas. thirty-one states will receive eco-
nomic benefits by the enhanced water car-
rying capacity of the Mississippi River Ship
Channel, also known as the gateway to
America’s Heartland; and
Whereas, the Mississippi River Ship Chan-
nel and tributaries currently account for
seven hundred fifty billion dollars of the na-
tion’s economy and two million four hundred
thousand jobs; and
Whereas, each new additional foot of water
draft will account for an additional one mil-
lion dollars in cargo on a vessel. Therefore,
be it
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana
memorializes the Congress of the United
States to provide adequate funding to the
United States Army Corps of Engineers for
the completion of the proposed project to
deepen the Mississippi River Ship Channel to
fifty feet.
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution
shall be transmitted to the secretary of the
United States Senate and the clerk of the
United States House of Representatives, to
each member of the Louisiana delegation to
the United States Congress, the assistant
secretary of the Army for Civil Works, the
commander of the United States Army Corps
of Engineers New Orleans District, and the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4168 June 20, 2019
POM–96. A concurrent resolution adopted
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana
urging the United States Congress to review
the definition of abortion and the use of the
term abortion for medical purposes of med-
ical records when a woman has a sponta-
neous miscarriage; to the Committee on
Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 130
Whereas. a spontaneous miscarriage is the
unavoidable and untreatable process of natu-
rally ending a pregnancy before the twen-
tieth week of gestation; and
Whereas, according to national estimates,
approximately fifteen to twenty percent of
all pregnancies in the United States end in
miscarriage; and
Whereas, according to the American Col-
lege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,
roughly sixty percent of miscarriages occur
when an embryo has an abnormal number of
chromosomes during fertilization, a problem
that happens by chance, not as a result of
anything the parents did: and
Whereas, the devastation and grief associ-
ated with a miscarriage leave women to feel
as though they had done something wrong to
cause it; and
Whereas, the trauma is compounded by
physicians, hospitals, clinics, health insur-
ers, and other healthcare providers inter-
changeably using medical terminology such
as abortion, spontaneous abortion, missed
abortion, inevitable abortion, incomplete
abortion, or septic abortion with sponta-
neous miscarriage; and
Whereas, towards the end of the last cen-
tury, medical journals and healthcare profes-
sionals consciously began using the term
spontaneous miscarriage instead of abortion
as both an intuitive empathetic response to
the stigma of abortion and as a reflection of
legal, technological, professional, and social
developments relative to women who experi-
ence miscarriage: and
Whereas, despite the evolution and clinical
clarity of the use of the term spontaneous
miscarriage, many women are horrified to
find that the medical diagnosis or condition
listed in their patient medical record indi-
cates abortion; and
Whereas, although not technically incor-
rect based on customary and acceptable med-
ical terminology, the use of the term abor-
tion has a widely recognized modern day im-
plication of intentionally causing the death
of an unborn child; and
Whereas, charting, coding, and billing sys-
tems include Current Procedures Termi-
nology (CPT) codes, International Statis-
tical Classification of Diseases and Related
Health Problems, 9th revision (ICD–9), diag-
nosis-related group (DRG) codes, and other
diagnosis and procedure codes utilized in the
United States healthcare system; and
Whereas, a conscious and collective assess-
ment needs to be done at the highest level of
regulatory authority in the United States to
provide for definitive and distinctive use of
the terms spontaneous miscarriage versus
abortion: Therefore, be it Resolved, That the
Legislature of Louisiana memorializes the
Congress of the United States to review the
definition of abortion and the use of the
term abortion for purposes of medical
records when a woman has a spontaneous
miscarriage; and be it further
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution
shall be transmitted to the secretary of the
United States Senate, the clerk of the
United States House of Representatives, and
to each member of the Louisiana delegation
to the United States Congress.

f
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mr. PORTMAN:
S. 1925. A bill to authorize State
opioid response grants, and for other
purposes; to the Committee on Health,
Education, Labor, and Pensions.
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today
I am here to continue the important
conversation we had on this floor about
the ongoing addiction crisis we face in
this country. Over the past 2 years, I
have come to the floor 57 times to talk
about addiction, and usually it has
been about opioids and the impact
opioids are having—tearing our fami-
lies apart, devastating our commu-
nities. There is certainly an opioid epi-
demic in this country with prescription
drugs, fentanyl, heroin—it is true—but
we also have to focus on the fact that
we have a broader problem. That is
what I am going to talk about today,
along with what we can do about it.
Congress has done a lot in the last
several years. When looking at what
was proposed and what was passed, we
put new policies in place at the Federal
level to promote better prevention,
better treatment programs, and better
long-term recovery. We passed legisla-
tion to stop some of these deadly drugs
from coming into our country. That
has helped somewhat. Those legislative
initiatives, such as the CARA Act, the
21st Century Cures Act, and the STOP
Act, are starting to work.
Over $3 billion of additional funds has
been appropriated by this Congress just
in the last 3 years alone to ensure that
we have the ability to push back
against this epidemic. In my home
State of Ohio—one of the States hard-
est hit by this epidemic—we received
nearly $140 million from the CARA and
Cures grants. It is going toward stuff
that is working—evidence-based pre-
vention, innovative approaches to
treatment and getting people into
treatment, and closing some of the
gaps in the continuum of prevention,
treatment, and recovery. A lot of peo-
ple were falling between the cracks.
Closing those gaps has a made a big dif-
ference in my State. We also equipped
our first responders with what they
need and the training they need to help
push back.
The good news is, these programs are
starting to work. Drug overdose deaths
are still way too high, but for the first
time in 8 years—8 years of increased
overdose deaths every year—we are
seeing a reduction in overdose deaths.
In my own State of Ohio, we have
seen significant progress. We have had
a 21-percent drop in our overdose
deaths finally after 8 years of in-
creases. This was the biggest drop in
the Nation from July 2017 to June of
2018, according to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control National Center of Health
Statistics. Nationally, again after 8
years of annual increased deaths, we
have seen a leveling out—in fact, a
very modest downturn. Between 2017
and 2018, overdose deaths fell from
73,000 to 71,000. In all, the overdose rate
dropped in 21 States. Overall, there has
been only about a 1-percent drop, so it
is very modest but a lot better than
the alternative we have seen for 8
years, which is increased deaths.
As we begin to turn the tide on the
opioid epidemic, I am convinced that
we would be doing even better if not for
the influx of fentanyl. About 4 or 5
years ago, fentanyl came to our coun-
try in a big way—almost entirely from
China and almost always through our
own U.S. Postal Service, believe it or
not—and it has caused all kinds of
havoc. It is the deadliest of all the
drugs. When you look at overdose
deaths, the primary cause now is
fentanyl. It is a synthetic drug that is
50 times more powerful than heroin.
We are beginning to push back again,
including with our STOP Act, which
has now been passed, which requires
the post office to begin screening and
stopping some of these packages from
coming in. We will do a better job in
working with China. We have commit-
ments from them, and we hope they
will follow through on them.
Even as this limited progress is being
made on the opioid front, we have a
new, growing danger. I have heard this
over the past few years from law en-
forcement and from providers—from
people on the frontlines of the drug epi-
demic. They are seeing a resurgence of
what are called psychostimulants.
Mostly it is pure, powerful meth-
amphetamine from Mexico—crystal
meth.
In the last couple of months, I have
heard about this from the people in the
trenches all over Ohio. I have talked to
community leaders in Knox County;
treatment providers in Southeast Ohio;
service providers in Columbus; the
ADAMHS Board in Adams, Lawrence,
and Scioto Counties; the leadership of

the Hamilton County Heroin Coalition;
and community leaders and law en-
forcement in Butler County and the
Dayton area just last week. From all
over the State, they all tell me the
same thing: We are making some
progress now on heroin, and that is
good. We are making limited progress
on keeping the fentanyl out. But we
are spinning our wheels on combating
particularly crystal meth, and they are
also seeing a resurgence of cocaine—
both of which are stimulants, and both
of which are causing havoc in these
communities, in part because, as a
psychostimulant, it leads to more vio-
lent behavior.
They are having a devastating im-
pact in my State. According to a 2018
report from Ohio University, these
psychostimulants—including meth—
were found in just nine overdose deaths
in 2010. That number rose to 556 over-
dose deaths in 2017, which is the most
recent data we have. That is an in-
crease of 6,000 percent. That same year,
Ohio had more than 1,500 people die of
cocaine overdose, which is an almost
140-percent increase from the year be-
fore.
This problem isn’t isolated to Ohio.
According to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, deaths involv-
ing cocaine, crystal meth, and other
psychostimulants have increased na-
tionwide. In the more than 70,000 drug
overdose deaths in 2017, more than
23,000 or nearly one-third involved co-
caine, meth, or both. Just from 2016 to
2017, in that 1 year, death rates involv-
ing cocaine and crystal meth increased
by approximately 33 percent. Increases
occurred across all demographic groups
and in all ZIP Codes.
In the case of meth in particular,
usage rates have gone up as opioid
rates have gone down. I am told by ex-
perts that this is for a few reasons.
Some meth users initially turned to
this drug to manage the heavy crashes
that followed prolonged usage of
opioids—heroin, fentanyl, and other
opioids—and then they became just as
addicted to meth as they had been to
opioids. Others turns to meth because
the drug is stronger and cheaper than
other options.
By the way, the days of home chem-
ists and one-pot meth labs in America
are largely gone. You probably can re-
member, 5, 10, 15 years ago, the meth
labs in your community. You are not
hearing about those now. That is the
good thing, but the bad thing is that
you are not hearing about them be-
cause the stuff coming from Mexico is
more powerful and less expensive. The
super-labs in Mexico run by the drug
cartels are mass-producing this meth.
It is powerful, deadly, and low cost. I
am told by law enforcement in Colum-
bus, OH, that crystal meth now costs
less than marijuana on the streets of
Columbus.
Most of this pure crystal meth enters
the United States from Mexico in bulk
at ports of entry along our southwest
border, often hidden in cars and trucks.
Our Customs and Border Protection of-
ficers, who are already stretched thin
by the ongoing migration crisis, don’t
have the resources to identify these
smuggled shipments. The INTERDICT
Act, which we passed here, is beginning
to help by providing some technology,
but, frankly, we need research on bet-
ter technology, and we need to provide
more funding to ensure we can stop
this deadly substance by identifying it
at the border to keep it from coming
in.
According to U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Protection, the amount of meth-
amphetamine at our ports of entry has
soared from about 14,000 pounds in 2012
to 56,000 pounds in 2018. We have also
seen a 38-percent increase in meth-
amphetamine trafficking along the
southern border just in the 1 year from
2017 to 2018. One troubling measure-
ment is that the number of crystal
meth submissions to the Ohio Bureau
of Criminal Investigation lab rose from
2,000 in 2015 to over 12,000 in 2018. That
is a 500-percent increase in my home
State. This is an indication of how
much of this is being detained, being
found by law enforcement and taken to
these labs.
As I heard from folks all across Ohio,
we are also seeing meth laced with
other drugs, including fentanyl, heroin,
and sometimes cocaine. I am told that
sometimes the cartels mix these drugs
into methamphetamine to lower the
cost of the final product, meaning that
the users may be consuming dangerous
opioids without realizing it. Other traf-
fickers do so because they know that
fentanyl is incredibly addictive. You
may think it is one thing, but it is
really another. Any street drug you use
is potentially deadly—remember that.
We still don’t have the full picture of
how these drugs are being mixed to-
gether and sold for consumption. Over
the past 2 years, I have seen more re-
ports of individuals in Ohio who used
cocaine that, unknown to them, had
been mixed with fentanyl. In the last
month alone, at least 49 Ohioans in my
hometown of Cincinnati, OH, were
killed by that deadly combination. It
has been hitting our African-American
communities particularly hard.
Again, this highlights how the drug
cartels sometimes try to hook users by
cutting stimulants with addictive,
deadly fentanyl, often with lethal out-
comes.
The bottom line is, we have to ad-
dress the broader issue of addiction,
not just the issue of individual drugs.
We know that crystal meth and co-
caine are increasing pretty dramati-
cally. That is why we have to continue
our fight against opioid use but also
provide more flexibility to our commu-
nities. As a result, today I am intro-
ducing new legislation designed to ad-
dress the resurgence of crystal meth
and cocaine into our communities.
To date, the grants provided by the
21st Century Cures Act—these are
grants that go directly back to the
States, and the States determine how
they are used in local communities.
These are called State opioid response
grants. They have been used to in-
crease access to naloxone—a miracle
drug that reverses the overdose. They
have also been used for longer term ad-
diction treatment and support services
for opioids.
For all the good they have done,
these grants can’t be used effectively
to combat the drug crisis beyond
opioids, which ignores the new on-the-
ground reality of addiction in my State
and many others. So the legislation I
am introducing today will make a sim-
ple change to existing law. It will allow
the State opioid response grants to be
more flexible so they can be used for
whatever the drug addiction problem is
on the ground, which will be a little
different for every State and, for that
matter, every community. In par-
ticular, dollars would be able to be
used in programs focused on meth-
amphetamine and cocaine treatment
and recovery.
We know these existing funds are
making a difference. We have to be
sure and keep this program going. That
is why my legislation will also reau-
thorize the State opioid response
grants program with this flexibility
but reauthorize it for 5 years, providing
$500 million annually to ensure there is
stable funding.
A stable funding stream to these
States is absolutely essential to having
the predictability and the certainty we
need to continue to make progress and
to avoid these new drugs coming in and
creating more devastation in our com-
munities. It is a simple, commonsense
change that will allow State and local
organizations the flexibility they need
to fight what is quickly becoming a
two-front war on addiction.
The fact that we are continuing to
see these new types of drugs pop up in
Ohio and around the country high-
lights the reality that this is a fight
against addiction. Addiction is a dis-
ease. Again, this Congress has done an
unprecedented amount of work in this
area in the last few years, and I com-
mend us for that, but we have to do
more. We have to provide this flexi-
bility. We have to be sure we are focus-
ing on the fight against addiction, not
just on individual drugs.
While I am encouraged by the wel-
comed progress in preventing opioid
overdose deaths, we cannot rest on our
laurels. The cartels continue to pump
new combinations of opioids and stimu-
lants into vulnerable communities,
hooking individuals on yet another
toxic drug and perpetrating this cycle
of addiction. Let’s keep our unprece-
dented bipartisan efforts going in this
body. Let’s continue to partner with
allies, local government and State gov-
ernments, and with our nonprofits.
Let’s make sure the resources are there
to continue to save lives and restore
communities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4174 June 20, 2019
S. 1932. A bill to support water infra-
structure in Reclamation States, and
for other purposes; to the Committee
on Energy and Natural Resources .
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I
rise today to speak about the Drought
Resiliency and Water Supply Improve-
ment Act, which Senator CORY GARD-
NER (R–CO) introduced today. I am the
lead Democratic sponsor on the bill,
and Senators MARTHA MCSALLY (R–AZ)
and KYRSTEN SINEMA (D–AZ) are also
original cosponsors.
Drought—increasingly severe and
prolonged drought—is a stark reality
for California and the West. Climate
change presents a triple threat to our
water supply:
Higher temperatures causing a dwin-
dling snowpack, increased evaporation
and other effects that will reduce our
natural storage and runoff. This could
decrease flow in the Colorado River by
20% or more by mid-century and as
much as 40% by the end of the century.
Longer and more severe droughts, in-
cluding perhaps as much as an 80%
chance of a megadrought of 20 to 50
years’ duration in the Colorado Basin
during this century.
Although this is more uncertain, the
possibility of reduced overall precipita-
tion, perhaps 10–15% less in California’s
Sierra Nevada mountains within the
next 20–30 years.
We must respond to this challenge.
The bill we are introducing today does
so in three fundamental ways:
It significantly increases funding for
an ‘‘all-of-the above’’ solution to im-
prove our water supply, including sur-
face and groundwater storage, convey-
ance, water recycling and desalination;
It reforms the Bureau of Reclama-
tion’s outdated project delivery system
to more quickly approve and more
cost-effectively fund new projects; and
It significantly invests not only in
water supply projects, but also in envi-
ronmental restoration to help imper-
iled species adapt to climate change as
well.
Climate Change and Drought: I would
like to say more about the effects of
climate change on two critical areas
for California: the Sierra Nevada
Mountains, and the Colorado River
Basin.
Lawrence Berkeley National Labora-
tory scientists project that climate
change will cause a 54 percent drop in
the Sierras’ snowpack within the next
20 to 40 years and a 79 percent drop by
the end of the century. This change
alone could be devastating for Cali-
fornia, because we absolutely depend
on this snowpack. The Sierra snowpack
provides 30% of our water supply and is
our biggest reservoir. We need to start
now to provide substitute ways for
storing precipitation in the Sierras,
whether through surface storage,
groundwater storage, or improved in-
frastructure to transport floodwaters
to the best recharge areas.
This enhanced storage in its many
forms will be helpful not only for water
users but also to maintain enough cold
water for salmon. Cold water reserves
are critical to prevent salmon runs
from being wiped out during years of
devastating droughts.
The outlook for the Colorado Basin is
perhaps even more challenging. The
Colorado River provides a critical part
of the water supply for 19 million peo-
ple in southern California, but that
water supply is diminishing. Already in
2019 the water demands on the Colo-
rado River exceed average inflows to
the river by 1.2 million to 1.5 million
acre feet each year.
That is a huge gap, and the Drought
Contingency Plan that was just nego-
tiated among the 7 Colorado River
Basin states represents just the begin-
ning of efforts needed to close even the
existing gap. With climate change, far
more needs to be done, especially with
warmer temperatures and greatly in-
creased evaporation in the Basin and
with the considerable odds of a
megadrought of 20 to 50 years’ dura-
tion.
The bill we are introducing today
provides the Colorado River Basin
States with the tools to begin invest-
ing in a wide range of water supply
projects to meet this challenge. I be-
lieve this bill will be critical for help-
ing reach agreement in the next round
of negotiations for Colorado River
drought contingency plans due to be
completed by 2026.
Funding Authorizations in the Bill:
In response to the water supply chal-
lenges presented by climate change,
the bill we are introducing today sig-
nificantly increases funding authoriza-
tions for a wide variety of water supply
and environmental restoration
projects.
The proposed legislation builds on
and doubles the 5-year funding author-
izations in the 2016 Water Infrastruc-
ture Improvements for the Nation
(WIIN) Act. The bill authorizes the fol-
lowing funding over the next 5 years:
$670 million for surface and ground-
water storage projects, and supporting
conveyance;
$100 million for water recycling
projects; and
$60 million for desalination projects.
In addition, the bill authorizes $140
million for environmental restoration
and compliance projects. These
projects include forest, meadow and
watershed restoration projects with
water benefits and projects to help re-
store threatened and endangered spe-
cies affected by Bureau of Reclamation
water projects.
Low-Interest Loans for Water Supply
Projects: The bill creates a new loan
program at 30-year Treasury rates (cur-
rently about 2.6%) for water supply
projects known as the Reclamation In-
frastructure Finance and Innovation
Act (RIFIA). The loans would use exist-
ing criteria under the successful WIFIA
program (the Water Infrastructure Fi-
nance and Innovation Act).
The Office of Management and the
Budget (OMB) has approved loans of
$2.3 billion for WIFIA in fiscal year 2018
backed by appropriations of just over
1% of that amount or $25 million in
budget authority. OMB was able to ap-
prove loans backed by just 1% of the
loan amount because there is a vir-
tually non-existent default rate for
water projects. Only 4 in a thousand
water infrastructure projects default,
based on a study conducted by the
Fitch credit rating agency.
Given OMB’s experience that Federal
outlays need only cover 1% of the loan
cost for water projects, the $125 million
in authorized Federal spending in the
draft bill likely could support $12.5 bil-
lion in water project lending authority.
Needless to say, $12.5 billion is a
meaningful amount of Federal low-in-
terest lending assistance for new water
supply projects. And, because RIFIA is
limited to no more than 49 percent of
total project costs, that same $125 mil-
lion in RIFIA budget authority will
support no less than $25.5 billion in new
water infrastructure investments
throughout the west.
Need to Improve Reclamation’s
Project Delivery System: The bill not
only increases funding for drought re-
siliency projects, it expedites their ap-
provals and assists them more cost-ef-
fectively, stretching taxpayer dollars
further.
The traditional Bureau of Reclama-
tion model for approving and funding
new water supply projects has involved
the following:
Reclamation studies new projects in
detail, which can take a decade or
more for major projects:
Once Reclamation’s studies are com-
plete, Congress authorizes projects in-
dividually, which can take another 3–5
years or more in many cases; and
Congress then funds 100% of the
project construction cost over many
years of incremental appropriations,
with project sponsors paying back the
federal government over 50 years at lit-
tle to no interest.
One can quickly see that this model
can end up taking decades to construct
significant new water supply projects.
This is especially the case given the
limitations of Federal budgets and the
increasing cost of major projects in re-
cent years. Given the tremendous chal-
lenge posed by climate change to West-
ern water supply, we need a nimbler
and more responsive model.
Mike Connor, the Deputy Secretary
of the Interior during the Obama Ad-
ministration, testified in support of a
new model during an October 8, 2015

June 20, 2019
historic federal role in financing water stor-
age projects through the Bureau of Reclama-
tion must be revisited with a greater empha-
sis on non-federal financing.
Changes to Traditional Model: In re-
sponse to the concerns articulated by
Deputy Secretary Connor and others,
the bill we are introducing today,
building on the WIIN Act, makes five
significant changes to the traditional
Reclamation model. These changes ex-
pedite project approvals and make
more cost-effective use of available fed-
eral funding.
1) Congressional authorization no
longer required:
First, the bill eliminates the need for
Congress to authorize individual
projects. It can take 3–5 years for
projects to get legislatively approved
or longer. In fact, zero new water recy-
cling projects have been authorized
since 2009 due to the Federal earmark
ban.
While Congressional authorizations
are no longer required, Congress re-
tains full veto authority over which
projects get built through the appro-
priations process. Unless Congress ap-
proves funding for the study and con-
struction of individual projects, Rec-
lamation cannot proceed with them.
The advantage of the appropriations
process as an alternative mechanism
for Congressional approval is that it
occurs every year. So rather than wait-
ing 3–5 years or longer for Congres-
sional approval under the traditional
model, Congress decides each year
whether or not to fund proposed
projects.
2) Non-Federal funding is required
upfront:
Second, the bill no longer requires
100% federal funding upfront as was
necessary under the traditional Rec-
lamation model. Instead, the bill al-
lows a maximum of 50% Federal fund-
ing for Federally-owned projects, and a
maximum of 25% federal funding for
non-federal projects that are built by
States, water districts, or Indian
tribes.
Federal dollars can be stretched fur-
ther by the partnerships with States
and water districts that will be fos-
tered under the bill. For example, the
proposed expansion of Los Vaqueros
Reservoir in California would be funded
50% by the State of California, which
has already conditionally awarded
funding, in addition to potentially 10–
25% by the federal government and the
remaining 25–40% by water users.
Multi-partner projects like the Los
Vaqueros expansion will frequently
have multiple benefits. For example,
much of the State and Federal funding
for the Los Vaqueros expansion would
go to augment the water supply of
wildlife refuges that provide essential
water for migratory birds on the Pa-
cific flyway. These benefits would com-
plement the project’s water supply ben-
efits for many Bay Area water dis-
tricts.
3) Feasibility studies are expedited:
Third, for the non-Federal projects
authorized by the bill, the federal
study process would be significantly
expedited, and it does so without
waiving any environmental protection
requirements. The bill makes clear
that federal environmental laws must
be fully and strictly followed.
Existing law, however, already ad-
dresses study procedures in parallel
circumstances when the nonfederal en-
tities are building a project and the
federal government is only responsible
for a minority of the project cost, no
more than 25%. In these circumstances,
the Federal government can and should
expeditiously approve feasibility and
other preliminary studies. There is ex-
isting precedent for such projects in
the guidelines adopted by the Bureau
of Reclamation for feasibility studies
for water recycling projects under the
Title XVI program. Like all the non-
federal projects in this bill, these water
recycling projects are built by non-fed-
eral entities with a maximum 25% fed-
eral cost-share.
The bill we are introducing today
would direct Reclamation to model its
feasibility study standards for all non-
federal projects based on the Title XVI
example. This will reduce delays in
project approval and get these projects
built faster.
4) The new loan program is cost-ef-
fective:
Fourth, the low-interest loan pro-
gram created by the bill is an excep-
tionally cost-effective program. As I
mentioned above, OMB has validated
that low-interest water project loans
need to be backed by Federal appro-
priations totaling only 1% of the
project loan amount.
Federal funding of 1% of the loan
amount will typically return 10–25%
savings in the repayment cost of the
loans for the water districts funding
the projects. The total savings can be
about 10% for AAA rated districts, and
20–25% for AA-rated districts.
For example, the water users who are
supporting the proposed Sites Res-
ervoir in northern California have esti-
mated that the loans authorized by
this bill would allow them to pay only
$512/acre-foot for water delivered by
the project instead of $682/acre-foot.
This is a 25% reduction in their costs.
Thus, the Federal government can
provide a loan at 1% of the loan
amount and save the project sponsors
10–25% of the project cost. That is an
exceptionally cost-effective federal in-
vestment.
There are at least three significant
reasons that the loans are so beneficial
for the project sponsors:
The sponsors pay about a 2.6% inter-
est rate on their loans based on today’s
rates, versus 4% or greater rates for
the alternative of municipal bond fi-
nancing.
The districts would not need to start
loan repayments until 5 years after
substantial completion of the project, a
substantial cost saver.
Loans are for 35 rather than 30 years,
lowering annual debt service costs.
Significantly, the loans include all
the taxpayer protections from the suc-
cessful WIFIA and TIFIA (Transpor-
tation Infrastructure Finance and In-
novation Act) programs. In particular,
the RIFIA loans would be limited to
49% of the project cost, and the federal
loans would have senior status in the
event of any default. These provisions
ensure the taxpayer won’t be harmed
in any default where the project re-
tains at least 50% of its value, which is
extremely likely for ratepayer backed
water supply projects.
5) Federal grants and loans work to-
gether:
Fifth, the combination of low-inter-
est loans and Federal grants of up to
25% of project costs for non-Federal
projects can allow water users to make
up the difference where the Federal
government is no longer funding 100%
of project costs up front. Many rural
communities, and in particular agri-
cultural communities, are not able to
pay 100% of the cost of new water sup-
ply projects.
Under the bill we are introducing
today, these communities will still
have to provide a significant cost-share
for improving their water supplies, and
new water projects will have to be cost-
effective enough to justify that invest-
ment. However, the Federal govern-
ment can help build the best and most
effective projects in increasing drought
resiliency by providing assistance
through both grants and loans.
Environmental Benefits: The longer
and more severe droughts coming with
climate change will adversely affect
not just farms and cities, but also the
natural environment. The bill includes
provisions to improve species’ drought
resiliency as well.
The significant funding authorization
of $140 million for environmental res-
toration can be used to benefit many
different species, including fish, migra-
tory birds, and forest species. Some of
the authorized uses of this funding in-
clude:
Improved habitat for salmon, Delta
smelt and other fish species adversely
affected by the Bureau of Reclama-
tion’s water projects;
Additional water for wildlife refuges
hosting migratory birds along the Pa-
cific flyway;
Improved stream gauges, monitoring
and science to better understand how
to restore species and to operate Rec-
lamation water projects with reduced
environmental impacts;
Assistance in implementing water-re-
lated settlements with State agencies
and state water quality laws; and
Forest, meadow and watershed res-
toration efforts that improve the qual-
ity, timing, or other attributes of run-
off to reservoirs or groundwater stor-
age facilities.
I want to say a little more about the
new authorization for forest, meadow
and watershed restoration projects
with water benefits. Wildfire and
drought are two of our biggest chal-
lenges in California, and we need new
tools to respond to them.
There are national forest lands and
meadows upstream of many reservoirs

in California that are at serious risk of
catastrophic fire.
If treatments of these lands restore
healthier ecological conditions, it will
improve water runoff into the down-
stream reservoirs and reduce the risk
of large sedimentation dumps into the
reservoirs from catastrophic fires.
Restoration of these lands may not
be a top priority for the Forest Service
because that agency’s mission does not
emphasize water benefits.
The bill being introduced today
would authorize the Bureau of Rec-
lamation to contribute a portion of the
cost of these projects. The new funding
source will in turn make these multi-
benefit projects more likely to be im-
plemented.
I believe it is critical that we develop
new tools like this one for reducing the
risk of catastrophic wildfires, and im-
proving our drought resiliency.
I and the other cosponsors of today’s
bill are also looking for additional
ways to increase the natural environ-
ment’s resiliency to droughts in our
states. We have circulated language for
discussion and potential inclusion in
the bill that would provide additional
funding for ‘‘natural water storage
projects.’’
These projects would help restore
stream and river channels with natural
materials like wetlands. Like many
other projects prioritized by the bill,
these projects could have multiple ben-
efits, including increased groundwater
recharge, improved flood protection,
and increased floodplain habitat to
benefit salmon and other species.
We look forward to receiving com-
ments on ways to prioritize multi-ben-
efit projects like natural water storage
projects as we move forward with the
bill.
In addition, the bill makes clear that
it must be implemented consistently
with all federal environmental laws,
including the Endangered Species Act,
the National Environmental Policy
Act, the Clean Water Act and all other
environmental laws. All applicable
state laws must also be followed.
Offsets: Finally, the bill includes two
provisions offsetting the new spending
authorizations within it:
It extends the existing WIIN Act pro-
visions allowing water districts to pre-
pay their outstanding capital debts and
convert to indefinite length water sup-
ply contracts. These provisions are ex-
pected to bring in additional revenue
within the 10-year scoring window.
It sets up a process to deauthorize in-
active water recycling project author-
izations.
Conclusion: California is home to
more than 40 million people, but our
major state-wide water infrastructure
hasn’t significantly changed in the
past 50 years, when we had only 16 mil-
lion people.
We must modernize the system or we
risk becoming a desert state.
I believe that this bill will place Cali-
fornia on a long-term path to drought
resiliency. Critically, this means put-
ting in place infrastructure to allow
our cities, our farmers, and our natural
communities to withstand the severe
droughts that we are projected to face
due to climate change.
I hope my Western colleagues will
join me and the others who have intro-
duced this bill, because drought is a se-
rious threat for all of our states.
Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield
the floor.

lowing resolution; which was referred
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions:
S. RES. 254
Whereas World Refugee Day is a global day
to acknowledge the courage, strength, and
determination of women, men, and children
who are forced to flee their homes due to
persecution;
Whereas, according to the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (referred to
in this preamble as ‘‘UNHCR’’) and the Ref-
ugee Act of 1980 (Public Law 96-212), a ref-
ugee is someone who—
(1) is outside of the country of his or her
nationality; and
(2) is unable or unwilling to return because
of persecution or a well-founded fear of per-
secution for reasons of race, religion, nation-
ality, political opinion, or membership in a
particular social group;
Whereas according to the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees—
(1) there are more than 70,800,000 displaced
people worldwide, the worst displacement
crisis in global history, including 25,900,000
refugees, more than 41,300,000 internally dis-
placed people, and 3,500,000 asylum seekers;
(2) the refugee population under UNHCR’s
mandate has nearly doubled since 2012;
(3) 67 percent of the world’s refugees come
from just 5 countries: Syria, Afghanistan,
South Sudan, Burma, and Somalia;
(4) children account for about 1⁄2 of the ref-
ugee population in the world, millions of
whom are unable to access basic services in-
cluding education;
(5) 13,600,000 individuals were newly dis-
placed due to conflict or persecution in 2018,
including 10,800,000 internally displaced per-
sons and 2,800,000 refugees and asylum seek-
ers, an average of 37,000 people per day;
(6) more than 1⁄2 of Syrians lived in dis-
placement in 2018, either displaced across
international borders or within their own
country;
(7) for the fourth consecutive year, Leb-
anon hosted the largest number of refugees
relative to its population, where 1 in 6 people
are refugees;
(8) more than 1,400,000 refugees were in
need of resettlement to a third country in
2018; and
(9) 25 countries admitted 92,400 refugees for
resettlement in 2018;
Whereas refugee children are 5 times more
likely to be out of school than nonrefugee
children;
Whereas refugees who are women and chil-
dren are often at greater risk of violence,
human trafficking, exploitation, and gender-
based violence;
Whereas the United States resettlement
program is a life-saving solution critical to
global humanitarian efforts, which serves to
strengthen global security, advance United
States foreign policy goals, and support re-
gional host countries, while assisting indi-
viduals and families in need;
Whereas, during the first 6 months of fiscal
year 2019, the United States welcomed 12,155
refugees into the country, which is fewer
than 50 percent of the administration’s ref-
ugee admissions goal of 30,000 refugees;
Whereas, at this pace, the United States
may not meet its fiscal year 2019 refugee ad-
missions goal;
Whereas refugees are the most vetted trav-
eler to enter the United States and are sub-
ject to extensive screening checks, including
in person interviews, biometric data checks,
and multiple interagency checks;
Whereas refugees are major contributors to
local economies, pay an average of $21,000
more in taxes than they receive in benefits,
and revitalize cities and towns by offsetting
population decline and boosting economic
growth throughout the country by opening
businesses, paying taxes, and buying homes;
and
Whereas several industries rely heavily on
refugee workers to support their economic
stability, and low rates of arrivals of refu-
gees, especially in towns that rely on refugee
populations to revitalize their industries,
has had serious impacts on economic growth:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) reaffirms the bipartisan commitment of
the United States to promote the safety,
health, and well-being of the millions of ref-
ugees, including the education of refugee
children and displaced persons who flee war,
persecution, or torture in search of peace,
hope, and freedom;
(2) recognizes those individuals who have
risked their lives working individually and
for nongovernmental organizations and
international agencies, such as UNHCR, to
provide life-saving assistance and protection
for people displaced by conflicts around the
world;
(3) underscores the importance of the
United States refugee resettlement program
as a critical tool for United States global
leadership—
(A) to leverage foreign policy;
(B) to strengthen national and regional se-
curity; and
(C) to demonstrate international support
of refugees;
(4) calls upon the United States Govern-
ment—
(A) to continue providing robust funding
for refugee protection overseas and resettle-
ment in the United States;
(B) to uphold its international leadership
role in responding to displacement crises
with humanitarian assistance and protection
of the most vulnerable populations;
(C) to work in partnership with the inter-
national community to find solutions to ex-
isting conflicts and prevent new conflicts
from beginning;
(D) to alleviate the burden placed on front-
line refugee host countries, such as the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the People’s
Republic of Bangladesh, and the Federal
Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, that ab-
sorb the majority of the world’s refugees

S. RES. 255
Whereas the United States has always been
a Nation of immigrants, and throughout the
history of the United States, immigrants and
their children from around the world have
kept the workforce in the United States vi-
brant and businesses in the United States on
the cutting edge, and helped to build the
greatest economic engine in the world;
Whereas the entrepreneurial drive and
spirit of the United States is built on a di-
versity of origins;
Whereas the American dream first drew
people to the United States and continues to
drive business in the United States;
Whereas the success of the United States is
a result of the many distinct experiences of
the people of the United States, not in spite
of it;
Whereas, as a Nation of immigrants, we
must remember the generations of pioneers
that helped lay the railroads and build cities,
develop new industries, and fuel innovation
and the exchange of ideas;
Whereas immigrants start more than a
quarter of all new businesses in the United
States, and immigrants and their children
start more than 40 percent of Fortune 500
companies;
Whereas these businesses collectively em-
ploy tens of millions of people in the United
States and generate more than
$5,500,000,000,000 in annual revenue;
Whereas immigrants enhance the produc-
tive capacity of the United States economy
and contribute approximately
$2,000,000,000,000, or about 10 percent of an-
nual gross domestic product of the United
States;
Whereas immigrants in the United States
contribute greatly to advances in technology
and sciences;
Whereas 16 percent of all employed college
graduates and 54.5 percent of individuals
with a Ph.D. working in the fields of science,
technology, engineering, and math are immi-
grants;
Whereas, between 2006 and 2012, 44 percent
of new tech startups in Silicon Valley, wide-
ly known as the international hub for tech-
nological development and innovation, had
at least 1 immigrant founder;
Whereas immigrants in the United States
plant, cultivate, and harvest the rich diver-
sity of agriculture products available today
from the farmlands of the United States;
Whereas each immigrant farm employee
supports 2 to 3 full-time jobs in processing,
transportation, and retail;
Whereas immigrants involved in agricul-
tural production aid in the food security and
independence of the United States;
Whereas the work of immigrants has di-
rectly enriched the culture of the United
States by influencing the performing arts
from Broadway to Hollywood, as well as aca-
demia, art, music, literature, media, fashion,
cuisine, customs, and cultural celebrations
enjoyed across the United States;
Whereas generations of immigrants have
come to the United States from all corners
of the world, and many immigrants tire-
lessly fought for the independence of the
United States, defending the ideals of the
country;
Whereas more than 30,000 lawful perma-
nent residents are serving in the Armed
Forces of the United States;
Whereas, since 2002, more than 102,000 men
and women, including individuals serving in
Iraq, Afghanistan, South Korea, Germany,
Japan, and elsewhere, have become citizens
while serving in the Armed Forces;
Whereas Congress represents a rich diver-
sity of communities across the United States
and works closely with a variety of diaspora
leaders from more than 60 ethnic caucuses to
ensure that the voices of United States citi-
zens from all backgrounds are heard; and
Whereas the United States was founded on
the universal promise that we are all created
equal: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) recognizes June 2019 as ‘‘Immigrant
Heritage Month’’ in honor of the accomplish-
ments and role of immigrants and their chil-
dren in shaping the history and culture of
the United States;
(2) pledges to celebrate immigrant con-
tributions to, and immigrant heritage in,
each State;
(3) welcomes immigrants and their chil-
dren to find their place in the vibrant, multi-
ethnic, and integrated society of the United

BRATING THE 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE SERVICEMEN’S RE-
ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 1944
Mr. CARPER (for himself, Mr. ISAK-
SON, and Mr. TESTER) submitted the
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Veterans’
Affairs:
S. RES. 256
Whereas, on July 28, 1943, in seeking a solu-
tion to integrate returning members of the
Armed Forces into civilian life, President
Franklin D. Roosevelt called for a com-
prehensive set of veterans benefits during a
fireside chat saying, ‘‘While concentrating
on military victory, we are not neglecting
the planning of the things to come . . . .
Among many other things we are, today, lay-
ing plans for the return to civilian life of our
gallant men and women in the Armed Serv-
ices.’’;
Whereas, on June 22, 1944, in demonstra-
tion of the full support of the United States
for the transition of members of the Armed
Forces to civilian life, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt signed into law the Servicemen’s
Readjustment Act of 1944 (58 Stat. 284, chap-
ter 268), more commonly known as the ‘‘G.I.
Bill of Rights’’;
Whereas the Servicemen’s Readjustment
Act of 1944 was the culmination of the tire-
less work and advocacy of veteran service or-
ganizations and Members of Congress;
Whereas the Act made immediate financial
support, transformative educational bene-
fits, and home loan guarantees available to
the 16,000,000 veterans who served in the
Armed Forces during World War II;
Whereas the Act helped approximately
7,800,000 veterans enroll in post-secondary
education or training, helped to democratize
higher education in the United States, and
caused total post-secondary education en-
rollment to grow exponentially from 1,676,856
in 1945, with veterans accounting for 5.2 per-
cent of total post-secondary education en-
rollment, to 2,338,226 in 1947, with veterans
accounting for 49.2 percent of the total;
Whereas the Act contributed approxi-
mately 450,000 engineers, 240,000 accountants,
238,000 teachers, 91,000 scientists, 67,000 doc-
tors, 122,000 dentists, 17,000 writers and edi-
tors, and thousands of other professionals to
the workforce of the United States and ex-
panded the middle class more than at any
other point in the history of the United
States;
Whereas the Act expressed the duty, re-
sponsibility, and desire of a grateful United
States to see to it that those who served on
active duty in the Armed Forces are afforded
every opportunity to become disciplined
forces for prosperity and progress in the
United States through economic opportunity
and investment;
Whereas Congress passed subsequent Acts
to provide educational assistance to new
generations of veterans, including the Vet-
erans’ Readjustment Benefits Act of 1966
(Public Law 89–358), the Post-Vietnam Era
Veterans’ Educational Assistance Act of 1977
(title IV of Public Law 94–502), the Veterans’
Educational Assistance Act of 1984 (title VII
of Public Law 98–525), the Post-9/11 Veterans
Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (title V of
Public Law 110–252), and the Harry W.
Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance
Act of 2017 (Public Law 115–48);
Whereas, since the signing of the Service-
men’s Readjustment Act of 1944, the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs has paid approxi-
mately $400,000,000,000 in educational assist-
ance to approximately 25,000,000 veterans and
their loved ones who continue to excel aca-
demically in post-secondary education;
Whereas the Act created the Department
of Veterans Affairs Home Loan Guarantee
program, which, since 1944, has provided a
pathway for approximately 24,000,000 vet-
erans to purchase a home guaranteed by the
Department, the majority of which are pur-
chased with no down payment;
Whereas the Act improved health care op-
portunities for veterans by transferring med-
ical facilities from the Army and the Navy
and providing funding for hospitals of the
Department of Veterans Affairs;
Whereas this combination of opportunities
changed the social and economic fabric of
the United States for the better, with a 1988
report from the Subcommittee on Education

eration that would serve for decades to guide
the transformation of the United States into
a global force for good;
(3) considers the veterans benefitting from

SENATE RESOLUTION 257—DESIG-
NATING JUNE 20, 2019, AS ‘‘AMER-
ICAN EAGLE DAY’’ AND CELE-
BRATING THE RECOVERY AND
RESTORATION OF THE BALD
EAGLE, THE NATIONAL SYMBOL
OF THE UNITED STATES
Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself, Mr.
DURBIN, Ms. BALDWIN, Mrs. BLACKBURN,
Mr. BOOKER, Mrs. CAPITO, Ms. COLLINS,
Mr. CRAMER, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr.
INHOFE, Mr. JONES, Mr. MANCHIN, Mr.
UDALL, and Mr. CARDIN) submitted the
following resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to:
S. RES. 257
Whereas the bald eagle was chosen as the
central image of the Great Seal of the United
States on June 20, 1782, by the Founding Fa-
thers at the Congress of the Confederation;
Whereas the bald eagle is widely known as
the living national symbol of the United
States and for many generations has rep-
resented values, such as—
(1) freedom;
(2) democracy;
(3) courage;
(4) strength;
(5) spirit;
(6) independence;
(7) justice; and
(8) excellence;
Whereas the bald eagle is unique to North
America and cannot be found naturally in
any other part of the world, which was one of
the primary reasons the Founding Fathers
selected the bald eagle to symbolize the Gov-
ernment of the United States;
Whereas the bald eagle is the central
image used in the official logos of many
branches and departments of the Federal
Government, including—
(1) the Executive Office of the President;
(2) Congress;
(3) the Supreme Court of the United
States;
(4) the Department of Defense;
(5) the Department of the Treasury;
(6) the Department of Justice;
(7) the Department of State;
(8) the Department of Commerce;
(9) the Department of Homeland Security;
(10) the Department of Veterans Affairs;
(11) the Department of Labor;
(12) the Department of Health and Human
Services;
(13) the Department of Energy;
(14) the Department of Housing and Urban
Development;
(15) the Central Intelligence Agency; and
(16) the United States Postal Service;
Whereas the bald eagle is an inspiring sym-
bol of the spirit of freedom and the sov-
ereignty of the United States;
Whereas the image and symbolism of the
bald eagle has—
(1) played a significant role in art, music,
literature, architecture, commerce, edu-
cation, and culture in the United States; and
(2) appeared on United States stamps, cur-
rency, and coinage;
Whereas the bald eagle was endangered and
facing possible extinction in the lower 48
States but has made a gradual and encour-
aging comeback to the land, waterways, and
skies of the United States;
Whereas the dramatic recovery of the na-
tional bird of the United States is an endan-
gered species success story and an inspira-
tional example to other environmental, nat-
ural resource, and wildlife conservation ef-
forts worldwide;
Whereas, in 1940, noting that the bald eagle
was threatened with extinction, Congress
passed the Act of June 8, 1940 (commonly
known as the ‘‘Bald Eagle Protection Act’’)
(16 U.S.C. 668 et seq.), which prohibited kill-
ing, selling, or possessing the species, and a
1962 amendment expanded protection to the
golden eagle;
Whereas, by 1963, there were only an esti-
mated 417 nesting pairs of bald eagles re-
maining in the lower 48 States, with loss of
habitat, poaching, and the use of pesticides
and other environmental contaminants con-
tributing to the near demise of the national
bird of the United States;
Whereas, in 1967, the bald eagle was offi-
cially declared an endangered species under
Public Law 89–669 (80 Stat. 926) (commonly
known as the ‘‘Endangered Species Preserva-
tion Act of 1966’’) in areas in the United
States south of the 40th parallel due to the
dramatic decline in the population of the
bald eagle in the lower 48 States;
Whereas the Endangered Species Act of
1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) was enacted in
1973, and in 1978, the bald eagle was listed as
an endangered species throughout the lower
48 States, except in the States of Michigan,
Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, and Wis-
consin, in which the bald eagle was listed as
a threatened species;
Whereas, in July 1995, the United States
Fish and Wildlife Service announced that in
the lower 48 States, the bald eagle had recov-
ered sufficiently to change the status of the
species from endangered to threatened;
Whereas, by 2007, bald eagles residing in
the lower 48 States had rebounded to ap-
proximately 11,000 pairs;
Whereas, on June 28, 2007, the Secretary
the Interior and the Director of the United
States Fish and Wildlife Service removed the
bald eagle from protection under the Endan-
gered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et
seq.), but the bald eagle continues to be pro-
tected under the Act of June 8, 1940 (com-
monly known as the ‘‘Bald and Golden Eagle
Protection Act’’) (16 U.S.C. 668 et seq.), the
Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 et
seq.), section 42 of title 18, United States
Code (commonly known as the ‘‘Lacey Act’’),
and the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16
U.S.C. 3371 et seq.);
Whereas Challenger, the trained, edu-
cational bald eagle of the American Eagle
Foundation in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, was
invited by the Secretary of the Interior to
perform a free-flight demonstration during
the official bald eagle delisting ceremony
held at the Jefferson Memorial in Wash-
ington, District of Columbia;
Whereas experts and population growth
charts estimate that the bald eagle popu-
lation could reach 15,000 pairs, even though a
physical count has not been conducted by
State and Federal wildlife agencies since
2007;
Whereas caring and concerned agencies,
corporations, organizations, and people of
the United States representing Federal and
State governments and the private sector
passionately and resourcefully banded to-
gether, determined to save and protect the
national bird of the United States;
Whereas the recovery of the bald eagle pop-
ulation in the United States was largely ac-
complished through—
(1) the dedicated and vigilant efforts of
Federal and State wildlife agencies and non-
profit organizations, such as the American
Eagle Foundation;
(2) public education;
(3) captive breeding and release programs;
(4) hacking and release programs; and
(5) the translocation of bald eagles from
places in the United States with dense bald
eagle populations to suitable locations in the
lower 48 States that had suffered a decrease
in bald eagle populations;
Whereas various nonprofit organizations,
such as the Southeastern Raptor Center at
Auburn University in the State of Alabama,
contribute to the continuing recovery of the
bald eagle through rehabilitation and edu-
cational efforts;
Whereas the bald eagle might have been
lost permanently if not for dedicated con-
servation efforts and strict protection laws
such as—
(1) the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16
U.S.C. 1531 et seq.);
(2) the Act of June 8, 1940 (commonly
known as the ‘‘Bald and Golden Eagle Pro-
tection Act’’) (16 U.S.C. 668 et seq.);
(3) the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16
U.S.C. 703 et seq.);
(4) section 42 of title 18, United States Code
(commonly known as the ‘‘Lacey Act’’); and
(5) the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16
U.S.C. 3371 et seq.); and
Whereas the sustained recovery of the bald
eagle population will require the continu-
ation of recovery, management, education,
and public awareness programs to ensure
that the population numbers and habitat of
the bald eagle remain healthy and secure for
generations to come: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) designates June 20, 2019, as ‘‘American
Eagle Day’’;
(2) applauds the issuance of bald eagle
commemorative coins by the Secretary of
the Treasury to generate critical funds for
the protection of the bald eagle; and
(3) encourages—
(A) educational entities, organizations,
businesses, conservation groups, and govern-
ment agencies with a shared interest in con-
serving endangered species to collaborate

SENATE RESOLUTION 258—EX-
PRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE
DESIGNATION OF MAY 2019 AS
‘‘NATIONAL BRAIN TUMOR
AWARENESS MONTH’’
Mr. DAINES (for himself, Mr. MAR-
KEY, Ms. COLLINS, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, and
Ms. WARREN) submitted the following
resolution; which was considered and
agreed to:
S. RES. 258
Whereas an estimated 86,970 new cases of
primary brain tumors are expected to be di-
agnosed in the United States during calendar
year 2019;
Whereas pediatric brain tumors are the
leading cause of death from cancer in chil-
dren under the age of 19;
Whereas the average survival rate in the
United States for all malignant brain tumor
patients is only 35 percent;
Whereas, in 2019, an estimated 16,830 people
in the United States will die as a result of a
malignant brain tumor;
Whereas brain tumors may be malignant
or benign, but can be life-threatening in ei-
ther case;
Whereas nearly 700,000 people in the United
States are currently living with a brain
tumor;
Whereas treatment of brain tumors is com-
plicated by the fact that there are more than
130 different types of brain tumors;
Whereas the treatment and removal of
brain tumors present significant challenges
due to the uniquely complex and fragile na-
ture of the brain;
Whereas brain tumors affect the primary
organ in the human body that controls not
only cognitive ability, but the actions of
every other organ and limb in the body, lead-
ing to brain tumors being described as a dis-
ease that affects the whole individual;
Whereas brain tumor research is supported
by a number of private, nonprofit research
foundations and by Federal medical research
institutions;
Whereas basic research may fuel advance-
ments and development of new treatments
for brain tumors;
Whereas obstacles to the development of
new treatments for brain tumors remain,
and there are limited strategies for the
screening or early detection of brain tumors;
Whereas, despite the high number of indi-
viduals diagnosed with a brain tumor every
year and the devastating prognoses for such
individuals, only 5 drugs and 1 medical de-
vice are approved by the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration to treat brain tumors;
Whereas the mortality rates associated
with brain tumors have changed little during
the past 30 years;
Whereas there is a need for greater public
awareness of brain tumors, including the dif-
ficulties associated with research on these
tumors and the opportunities for advances in
brain tumor research and treatment; and
Whereas May 2019, during which brain
tumor advocates nationwide unite in aware-
ness, outreach, and advocacy activities, is an
appropriate month to recognize as ‘‘National
Brain Tumor Awareness Month’’: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) supports the designation of May 2019 as
‘‘National Brain Tumor Awareness Month’’;
(2) encourages increased public awareness
of brain tumors to honor those individuals
who have lost their lives to this devastating
disease or currently live with a brain tumor
diagnosis;
(3) supports efforts to develop better treat-
ments for brain tumors that will improve the
quality of life and the long-term prognoses of
those individuals diagnosed with a brain
tumor;
(4) expresses its support for those individ-
uals who are battling brain tumors, as well
as the families, friends, and caregivers of
those individuals; and
(5) urges a collaborative approach to brain
tumor research, which is a promising means
of advancing understanding of, and treat-
ment for, brain tumors.

SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLU-
TION 20—EXPRESSING THE
SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT THE
PRESIDENT SHOULD POST-
HUMOUSLY AWARD THE PRESI-
DENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM
TO HARRY W. COLMERY
Mr. MORAN (for himself and Mr.
ROBERTS) submitted the following con-
current resolution; which was referred
to the Committee on the Judiciary:
S. CON. RES. 20
Whereas the life of Harry W. Colmery of
Topeka, Kansas, was marked by service to
the United States and its citizens;
Whereas in 1916, Harry Colmery earned a
degree in law from the University of Pitts-
burgh and successfully argued 2 significant
cases before the Supreme Court of the United
States;
Whereas during World War I, Harry
Colmery joined the Army Air Service, serv-
ing as a first lieutenant during the early
stages of military aviation;
Whereas after World War I, Harry Colmery
actively contributed to the growth of the
newly formed American Legion and went on
to hold several offices in the Legion and was
elected National Commander in 1936;
Whereas in 1943, the United States faced
the return from World War II of what was to
become an active duty force of 15,000,000 sol-
diers, sailors, airmen, and Marines;
Whereas Harry Colmery spearheaded the
efforts of the American Legion to develop
legislation to ensure that these individuals,
who had fought for the democratic ideals of
the United States and to preserve freedom,
could fully participate in all of the opportu-
nities the United States provided;
Whereas in December 1943, during an emer-
gency meeting of the American Legion lead-
ership, Harry Colmery initially drafted the
legislation that became the Servicemen’s
Readjustment Act of 1944, also known as the
GI Bill of Rights;
Whereas the GI Bill of Rights is credited
by veterans’ service organizations, econo-
mists, and historians as the engine that
transformed the postwar United States into
a more egalitarian, prosperous, and enlight-
ened Nation poised to lead the world into the
21st century;
Whereas since its enactment, the GI Bill of
Rights has provided education or training for
approximately 7,800,000 individuals, includ-
ing 2,200,000 in college, 3,400,000 in other
schools, 1,400,000 in vocational education,
and 690,000 in farm training;
Whereas 2,100,000 World War II veterans
purchased homes through the GI Bill;
Whereas the initial GI Bill has provided
education and training to over 800,000 profes-
sionals that serve the Nation in specific ca-
reer fields, including 450,000 engineers, 238,000
teachers, 91,000 scientists, 67,000 doctors, and
22,000 dentists;
Whereas in 1945, President Truman estab-
lished the Presidential Medal of Freedom to
recognize notable service during the war, and
in 1963, President Kennedy reinstated the
medal to honor the achievement of civilians
during peacetime;
Whereas pursuant to Executive Order 11085
(27 Fed. Reg. 1759), the President may award
the Medal of Freedom to any person who has
made an especially meritorious contribution
to—
(1) the security or national interest of the
United States;
(2) world peace; or
(3) other significant public or private en-
deavors; and
Whereas Harry Colmery, noted for his serv-
ice in the military, in the legal sector, and
on behalf of the veterans of the Nation,
meets the criteria established for the Presi-
dential Medal of Freedom: Now, therefore, be
it
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That it is the sense
of Congress that the President should post-
humously award the Presidential Medal of
Freedom to Harry W. Colmery of Topeka,
Kansas.

(1) Congress supports the finding on the
People’s Republic of China articulated in the
2018 National Defense Strategy and the 2017
National Security Strategy.
(2) The People’s Republic of China is
leveraging military modernization, influence
operations, and predatory economics to co-
erce neighboring countries to reorder the
Indo-Pacific region to the advantage of the
People’s Republic of China.
(3) As the People’s Republic of China con-
tinues its economic and military ascendance,
asserting power through a whole of govern-
ment long-term strategy, the People’s Re-
public of China will continue to pursue a
military modernization program that seeks
Indo-Pacific regional hegemony in the near-
term and displacement of the United States
to achieve global preeminence in the future.
(4) The most far-reaching objective of the
defense strategy of the United States is to
set the military relationship between the
United States and the People’s Republic of
China on a path toward transparency and
nonaggression.
(5) The People’s Republic of China uses
economic inducements and penalties, influ-
ence operations, and implied military
threats to persuade other countries to heed
the political and security agenda of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China.

critical to effective competition with the
People’s Republic of China.
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy
of the United States—
(1) to expand military, diplomatic, and eco-
nomic alliances and partnerships in the Indo-
Pacific region and with Europe and like-
minded countries around the globe that are
critical to effective competition with the
People’s Republic of China; and

allies and partners, a unified approach to ad-
dressing and deterring significant diplo-
matic, economic, and military challenges
posed by the People’s Republic of China.

OPERATE, AND MAINTAIN THE
MARDASSON MEMORIAL IN BAS-
TOGNE, BELGIUM.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress make the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) The Battle of the Bulge was the largest
land battle of World War II in which the
United States fought, yielded more than
75,000 American casualties over the winter of
1944–1945, and stopped the final German of-
fensive on the Western Front.
(2) The Battle of the Bulge is the second
largest battle fought in the history of the
United States Army.
(3) Following the war, Belgian groups
raised funds to construct the Mardasson Me-
morial in Bastogne, Belgium, to honor Amer-
icans killed, wounded, and missing in action
during the Battle of the Bulge.
(4) The Mardasson Memorial, inaugurated
in 1950, is a five-pointed American star with
the history of the battle, the names of the
units that fought, and the names of the
States engraved in gold letters throughout.
(5) The Mardasson Memorial, owned and
maintained by the Government of Belgium,
and the only memorial to the United States
effort during the Battle of the Bulge, is in
need of extensive repair to restore it to a
condition commensurate to the service and
sacrifice it honors.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress to support an agreement between
the American Battle Monument Commission
(hereinafter referred to as ‘‘ABMC’’) and the
Government of Belgium—
(1) under the monument maintenance pro-
gram of the ABMC, and subject to the re-
quirements of such program, by which the
ABMC would use its expertise and presence
in Europe to oversee restoration of the
Mardasson Memorial in preparation for the
75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge;
and
(2) under the monument trust fund pro-
gram of the ABMC, and subject to the re-
quirements of such program, by which the
ABMC assumes ownership and responsibility
for the Mardasson Memorial, ensuring that
the Memorial stands for decades to come,
honoring American service and sacrifice, and
inspiring future generations.

SEC. lll. ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the fol-
lowing:
(1) During the first 5 months of May 2019,
the United States Border Patrol has appre-
hended more than 593,000 people ilegally
crossing the southern border of the United
States, which represents more apprehension
than in all of 2018.
(2) In May 2019, 132,887 people were appre-
hended by the United States Border Patrol,
of whom more than 96,000 were part of family
units or unaccompanied minors.
(3) This recent surge in illegal border
crossings—
(A) has placed an unprecedented strain on
the resources of the Department of Home-
land Security, which has responded by di-
recting U.S. Customs and Border Patrol re-
sources away from legal ports of entry; and
(B) exceeds the capacity of the Department
of Health and Human Services, which is re-
sponsible for the care of unaccompanied chil-
dren who are apprehended at the border.
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense
of the Senate that—
(1) the recent surge of illegal border cross-
ings—
(A) is a national security threat; and
(B) has put significant strain on the de-
partments and agencies that are responsible
for securing the border, implementing our
Nation’s immigration laws, and providing
temporary housing for the people who are
awaiting removal proceedings; and
(2) the recent increase in apprehensions
along the southern border, coupled with the
lack of sufficient resources at the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security and the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services will fur-
ther exacerbate this humanitarian crisis.

RECOGNIZING THE 2019 CONGRES-
SIONAL ART COMPETITION WIN-
NER FROM TEXAS’ 11TH DIS-
TRICT
HON. K. MICHAEL CONAWAY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate the 2019 Congressional
Art Competition winner from Texas’ 11th Dis-
trict, Ms. Rylee Braden. Rylee’s piece was
chosen to be displayed in the tunnels under
the U.S. Capitol, where Members of Congress,
staff, and visitors from around the country can
view and appreciate it for a full year.
Rylee is a very accomplished senior at Wall
High School where she excels in academics,
athletics, and art. Her drawing titled ‘‘Mamaw
Molded Me’’ depicts the time-worn, loving
hands of her grandmother that she drew using
charcoal and colored pencils.
Rylee’s Mamaw, Rosalie Sturm, told me that
although she has always wanted to, she has
never had the opportunity to visit Washington,
D.C. Now through her granddaughter’s ren-
dering of her hands, a little piece of her will
not only travel to Washington but will be dis-
played in the Capitol itself. I am proud to have
the 11th District represented by a piece that
speaks to the wisdom that is passed down
through generations and the impact of a loving
parent and grandparent.
Again, I congratulate Rylee on her achieve-
ment and look forward to seeing her art every
day when I walk to and from the Capitol.

TRIBUTE TO THE GAY MEN’S
CHORUS OF LOS ANGELES
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the Gay Men’s Chorus of Los Ange-
les upon its 40th Anniversary.
In July of 1979, the Gay Men’s Chorus of
Los Angeles (GMCLA) was formed when nine-
ty-nine men stepped up at the Plummer Park
Community Center in West Hollywood, having
seen posters announcing the formation and
first rehearsal of a new gay chorus. Three
months later, the chorus performed at the Na-
tional March on Washington for Lesbian and
Gay Rights, thus marking the beginning of
their important legacy.
Throughout their forty-year history, GMCLA
members have used their comradery and
shared experiences to challenge stereotypes
and enrich the community. At the height of the
AIDS epidemic, the GMCLA family lost 150
members, but even that horrific tragedy did
not stop their work and their commitment to
celebrate and serve the LGBTQ community.
The GMCLA has since become an essential
part of the fabric of Los Angeles, with mem-
bers dedicating their time to advocating for
equality through song and community service.
The GMCLA has stayed true to its core
message of equality by transforming and nur-
turing the Los Angeles and LGBTQ commu-
nities through its initiatives, such as the Alive
Music Project. The multi-faceted project, which
has reached over 65,000 middle and high
school students, promotes acceptance and
anti-bullying, and provides opportunities for
music education programs in Los Angeles
schools. Additionally, the GMCLA is a proud
member of The Arts for Incarcerated Youth
Network which offers music education to juve-
nile detention center students. Through these
initiatives, the GMCLA reaches countless
youth.
Today, the GMCLA boasts over 300 mem-
bers and has performed in iconic venues
around the world, including Walt Disney Con-
cert Hall, the Hollywood Bowl, and Carnegie
Hall in New York. With each new venue, they
sing for a world that promotes acceptance and
is free from discrimination. The Gay Men’s
Chorus of Los Angeles will honor its anniver-
sary and the 50th Anniversary of the Stone-
wall uprising in August, when they will be
joined by the New York City Gay Men’s Cho-
rus for a historic concert and gala to benefit
their music education programs.
I am proud to recognize the Gay Men’s
Chorus of Los Angeles for four decades of
musical entertainment and outstanding service
to the LGBTQ and Los Angeles communities.
I ask all members to join me in congratulating
the Gay Men’s Chorus of Los Angeles for its
remarkable achievements.

HON. MAX ROSE

CASE OF MR. MICHAEL NGUYEN
HON. AL GREEN
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I
stand here today in support of Michael
Phuong Minh Nguyen—a proud American cit-
izen, a loving husband to Helen Nguyen, and
a doting father of four young daughters.
However, it saddens me deeply that Mr.
Nguyen has been unjustly detained by the Vi-
etnamese government for over eleven months
now—nearly a year—which has caused im-
mense suffering for his family and his entire
community.
Mr. Nguyen was arrested on July 7, 2018
while visiting relatives in Vietnam, detained
without official charges, and is only now finally
to stand trial next week on June 24, 2019 in
Ho Chi Minh City.
Mr. Nguyen has been an upstanding, model
citizen of the United States for some 40 years
and, to my knowledge, has no criminal record.
In fact, he is an entrepreneur and a small
business owner.
He is also a man of faith and is actively in-
volved in his local community church.
One of our most sacred duties as elected
officials is to protect our citizens from harm—
on both domestic and foreign soil—and indeed
I have never given up on my constituents
even after they have been deported or de-
tained abroad.
This is why, since his detention last year, I
have consistently urged, to both the United
States and Vietnamese governments, swift ac-
tion be taken to expeditiously return Mr. Mi-
chael Nguyen home.
I am tremendously grateful to my colleagues
in both chambers and on both sides of the
aisle for their tireless advocacy on behalf of
Mr. Nguyen and his family.
Madam Speaker, I close by respectfully im-
ploring the Vietnamese government to do the
right thing—ensure a fair trial, a speedy reso-
lution, and justice for Michael Nguyen.

MELISSA SANTA CRUZ
APPRECIATION DAY
HON. RAÚL M. GRIJALVA
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and congratulate Melissa
Santa Cruz in honor of her day of appreciation
as enacted by the City of South Tucson, Ari-
zona. A pillar of the local airwaves, Ms. Santa
Cruz has accomplished just as much in her
community as she has on the radio. Her driv-
ing passion both in her work and activism has
endeared her to all of her many listeners.
With over 30 years as an on-air personality,
Santa Cruz began her career in the town of
Globe, Arizona, on the country music station
KQSS 98.3 FM. She eventually moved back to
the Tucson area, being a featured personality
across many broadcast stations, and bringing
music of all genres to the listeners of Southern
Arizona. In her current role, Santa Cruz now
serves as Program Director for Tejano
1600AM, while continuing on as a country and
adult contemporary radio DJ on 97.1 The Bull
and My 92.9, respectively.
A daughter of former South Tucson Council-
man Reynaldo Santa Cruz, Melissa has al-
ways known the value of community. As a
young girl, Santa Cruz saw both her father as
well as her mother Lydia volunteer as mem-
bers of Santa Cruz Church Parish, and has
continued their work into her professional life.
Santa Cruz has made it a point to keep her

community up to date on local benefits and
functions, making a point to highlight families
and non-profit organizations in need. She not
only talks the talk, but walks the walk, and has
emceed events for various Latinx organiza-
tions such as Chicanos Por La Causa,
LULAC, and the League of Mexican American
Women.
Melissa Santa Cruz has truly indebted her-
self to the City of South Tucson and to South-
ern Arizona as a whole. She truly serves as
an inspiration to our community, broadcasting
the music of the Borderlands across Tejano
1600AM while also being proactive on issues
of importance to all Southern Arizonans. I am
proud to stand here on the floor today on Me-
lissa Santa Cruz Appreciation Day, in recogni-
tion of Melissa Santa Cruz as one of our com-
munity’s most valuable citizens.

RECOGNITION OF THE MARCHING
COBRAS FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary
of the Marching Cobras. It is my distinct honor
to congratulate this prestigious drill team on
fifty years of success. Throughout my public
life, I have been pleased to see this organiza-
tion grow in number and recognition.
In a time when Kansas City was experi-
encing a lull in our rich and vibrant music
scene, the Marching Cobras provided vitality
and energy by enthusiastically marching in the
style of Mr. Willie Arthur Smith. They played a
pivotal role in maintaining our city’s reputation
as a musical and cultural hub . It is my great
pleasure to recognize the Marching Cobras’
students and leaders, past, present, and fu-
ture. Their dedication has made this organiza-
tion what it is today. The Marching Cobras re-
flect the vibrant community they represent and
add bright colors to the rich historical fabric of
Kansas City.
Concerned with the lack of productive activi-
ties available to students, Mr. Willie Arthur
Smith saw an opportunity to provide his com-
munity with the means to both keep students
off the streets and share his passion for
marching. While teaching at Lincoln Junior
High, Smith taught a group of his students a
dance called the Madison Line for an all-stu-
dent talent show. This simple act marked the
birth of the Marching Cobras. Since 1969, the
Marching Cobras have risen to a place of
international recognition and continue their
legacy of excellence. They have won national
competitions and performed in events like the
American Royal and the Cotton Bowl. They
have even played prestigious venues from
Nice, France to the White House.
With every performance, the Marching Co-
bras act as ambassadors of Kansas City and
represent our city with pride. The dedication of
the students and leaders shows a devotion to
constant, beneficial improvement. It is this
demonstration of excellence that engenders a
desire for progress in every community that
the Marching Cobras touch. I look forward to
seeing the Marching Cobras’ legacy continue
to grow. They provide students with a means
for accomplishment and gaining valuable
skills. If it were not for people like Willie Arthur
Smith and other Marching Cobra leaders, hun-
dreds of students would not have the ability to
participate in this vibrant and meaningful expe-
rience.
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring
the Marching Cobras’ fiftieth anniversary of
bringing music, pride, and recognition to the
community. On behalf of myself and the entire
Fifth Congressional District of Missouri, it is
my joy to congratulate the Marching Cobras
on this significant milestone and wish them
even greater success in the years to come.

CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF
JEANNETTE FRANK AT THE ARC
OF SCHUYLER
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
celebrate the service of Jeannette Frank to
The Arc of Schuyler and congratulate her on
her retirement.
Jeannette Frank has dedicated her career to
The Arc of Schuyler, beginning nearly forty
years ago as an Outreach Worker. Jeannette
joined The Arc shortly after its formation in
1978, and has dedicated her career to aid
families and their loved ones with disabilities.
Her commitment to those supported by The
Arc of Schuyler and their families has been an
inspiration, both to her team at The Arc and
the community as a whole.
For the last eight years, Jeannette has
served as the Executive Director of The Arc of
Schuyler. Her dedication and hard work have
ensured the high quality of services that The
Arc provides to people with disabilities. She
has not only advanced community-based serv-
ices such the Schuyler County Transit and
Transportation Link-Line, but also social enter-
prises operated by The Arc such as Franklin
Street Gallery and Gift Shop and Glen
Copack.
As Jeannette moves forward with the next
chapter of her life, we applaud her tireless ef-
forts to improve the quality of life for people in
Schuyler County and we wish her all the best
in her retirement.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
celebrate Jeannette Frank and her extraor-
dinary career.

RECOGNIZING JUNE AS ALZ-
HEIMER & BRAIN AWARENESS
MONTH
HON. JOHN KATKO
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, June is Alz-
heimer’s & Brain Awareness Month and I rise
today to share with this chamber the impact
Alzheimer’s Disease has had on my family.
Today, 5.8 million Americans live with brain
disease. I have witnessed firsthand the bur-
dens of these illnesses because my father,
Andrew Katko, lived with Alzheimer’s for near-
ly a decade before passing away a few
months ago.
My family was faced with the difficult deci-
sion on how to care for our father during this
time in his life. This is not uncommon among
families after a brain disease diagnosis.
Often, family and friends are primary care-
takers for those suffering with Alzheimer’s and
dementia. My mother, Mary Lou, served as my
father’s primary caregiver, joining the 16 mil-
lion Americans who provide unpaid care. This
year, unpaid caregivers will provide 18.5 billion
hours of care valued at $234 billion.
The BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer’s Act
was signed into law last Congress and is now
being implemented. This legislation authorizes
the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion to research prevention methods for de-
mentias, establish local treatment facilities,

HONORING TUCSON’S NATIONAL
HISTORY DAY WINNERS
HON. RAÚL M. GRIJALVA
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in honor of Tucson, Arizona’s four stu-
dents who won first place at the National En-
dowment for the Humanities’ National History
Day contest. The young history buffs, Sean
Choudhry, Elias Rice-Bensch, Zia Rice-
Bensch, and Keona Wallen all attend the Ac-
celerated Learning Laboratory in my district.
Their website Radium Girls: From Jaw-Drop-
ping Tragedy to Glowing Triumph earned the
top prize in the contest that featured more
than 3,000 students from across the country.
National History Day began in the 1970s
and is the culmination of a yearlong academic
program for students in grades 6 through 12
to engage in historical research. Students
produce essays, exhibitions, films, perform-
ances, or websites to enter into local and state
competitions. State winners move on to com-
pete in the national finals at the University of
Maryland at College Park. The National En-
dowment for the Humanities has been a spon-
sor and partner of National History Day for
more than 30 years.
The theme for this year’s competition was
‘‘Triumph and Tragedy in History’’ and more
than a half million students submitted entries.
On their website, Sean, Elias, Zia, and Keona
state, ‘‘The radium girls were young factory
workers who unknowingly consumed lethal
amounts of radium, often resulting in slow,
painful deaths. Despite their tragic cir-
cumstances, their desire for change and per-
sistence in court caused revolutionary change
to workplace safety regulations and sparked
monumental scientific advancements regard-
ing radium and radioactivity.’’
The students go on to document how ra-
dium was commonly used and recommended.
At the focus of their website is the story of the
women who, at the start of the 20th century,
were exposed to high levels of radium in their
work as they painted watch dials. Such expo-
sure proved quickly fatal and resulted in phys-
ical deformities and cancer. The legal battles
that followed were tumultuous and provided
minor relief for the women who had been ex-
posed to radium. Their legacy, however, lives

be a focus on Capitol Hill.
These four incredible students have dem-
onstrated truly admirable talent and skill in
their deep dive into history. I am moved by
their desire to shed light on an overlooked and
long-forgotten story that still resonates today.
I want to congratulate Sean, Elias, Zia, Keona,
their families, and the educators who have
helped them get where they are today. I ex-
pect great things from each of them in the
near future and look forward to the positive
impact they will have on our district and
abroad.

IN HONOR OF MR. HARRY
WATKINS
HON. DAVID ROUZER
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize and honor the life of the late Mr.
Harry Watkins of Wrightsville Beach, North
Carolina. An architect for more than 40 years,
Harry Watkins left a lasting imprint on
Wrightsville Beach, Bald Head Island, Figure 8
Island and many other surrounding commu-
nities.
Harry got his start in architecture after
studying at North Carolina State University,
and went on to design many of the homes that
still stand there today. He always held a spe-
cial place in his heart for Bald Head Island.
Harry helped to grow Wrightsville Beach
true to his vision:
‘‘The architect must understand the commu-
nity, the environment, and especially the char-
acteristics of the specific site,’’ Harry said of
his design philosophy. He described his idea
of what a good home can be as ‘‘a joy when
things were going well, and a comfort when
they were not.’’
Harry passed away late last year, at the age
of 72. He left behind a legacy of architectural
vision and excellence. Even more importantly,
he is survived by his wife Vicki, his daughter
Brooke, and an entire community of friends,
neighbors and clients. Wrightsville Beach will
be forever grateful for his passion for his com-
munity.

HONORING THE EDUCATIONAL
EXCELLENCE OF DEVRATH IYER
HON. ANDY BIGGS

Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor an accomplished student from Chan-

one of fifty-two students to attend the annual
Research Science Institute (RSI) sponsored
by the Center for Excellence in Education in
collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. Each summer, RSI gathers a
small group of talented students to participate
in an intensive on-and off-campus science and
engineering summer program.
I have no doubt that Devrath and the other
young leaders selected to participate in this
program will excel in service to their schools
and communities. Devrath’s dedication to edu-
cational excellence and hard work is an exam-
ple for all of us to emulate. I am honored to
have such talent and motivation in my district.

IN RECOGNITION OF HAYDEN COR-
PORATION’S 100TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I would like to
take this opportunity to congratulate Hayden
Corporation of West Springfield, Massachu-
setts on its 100th year of business. Now in its
fourth generation of family ownership, the
Hayden Corporation represents the robust
character and history of economic innovation
in western Massachusetts. It is my pleasure to
recognize them on this significant milestone.
Hayden Corporation was founded by
Charles E. Hayden in 1919. At that time, the
company’s business was weaving and install-
ing wire cloth used in the paper industry. Hay-
den Corp. eventually grew to start building, in-
stalling, and servicing other paper-making
equipment under the leadership of Charles’
son, Charles Wesley ‘‘Wes’’ Hayden. Wes
also developed a patented process for
seamlessly welding stainless steel wire cloth.
Today, Hayden Corp. still services the paper
making industry with field teams working on
machinery in mills up and down the east coast
of the United States. But the last 100 years
has also seen Hayden Corp. diversify and ex-
pand to an enviable extent. Retired company
president John O. Hayden, as well as his son
and current president Daniel C. Hayden,
spearheaded the corporation into state-of-the-
art coating of parts for the paper and pulp in-
dustry, power generation, gas and oil explo-
ration and extraction, military applications, and
the plastics industry. One of Hayden Corpora-
tion’s customers has even been the U.S.
Navy, when the company coated a valve on
the submarine U.S.S. Springfield and its sister
boats. Hayden Corporation’s success and lon-
gevity is a testament to not only the Hayden
family and the company’s dedicated employ-
ees, but also the city of West Springfield and
the overarching American manufacturing story
of the entire region.
Once again Madam Speaker, over the
course of its 100-year history, Hayden Cor-
poration has demonstrated exemplary leader-
ship and integrity. Those traits are hallmarks
of the company’s outstanding work in western
Massachusetts and beyond, and are certainly
worthy of recognition. On the occasion of Hay-
den Corporation’s 100th anniversary, I wish
the Hayden family and the individuals who
work with them—some for decades—all the
best and much continued prosperity.

SANDY OXFORD
HON. KEVIN HERN
OF OKLAHOMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the re-
tirement of Sandy Oxford and thank this out-
standing Oklahoman for her service to my
community.
Ms. Oxford served as an Army clerk during
the Vietnam era, eventually switching to the
Navy where she was one of their top recruit-
ers.
Back home in Tulsa, she served as the of-
fice manager for the Tulsa Vet Center. Addi-
tionally, Ms. Oxford faithfully served as the
chair of the Mayor of Tulsa’s Veteran Advisory
Council. She served in this role with great
dedication for 10 years, never missing a single
meeting.
She has worked tirelessly to improve the
lives of veterans, including work on suicide
prevention initiatives and Vietnam Veteran
commemoration ceremonies.
To thank Ms. Oxford for her service, Tulsa’s
Mayor Bynum presented her a key to the city
and declared May 16th ‘‘Sandy Oxford Day’’ in
Tulsa.
I am honored to recognize Sandy Oxford as
she attends her final meeting of the advisory
council today. Her commitment to the City of
Tulsa will not soon be forgotten.

PRIATIONS ACT, 2020
SPEECH OF
HON. ROGER W. MARSHALL
OF KANSAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 19, 2019
The House in Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union had under
consideration the bill (H.R. 3055) making ap-
propriations for the Departments of Com-
merce and Justice, Science, and Related
Agencies for the fiscal year ending Sep-
tember 30, 2020, and for other purposes:
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Chair, I rise today
because American farmers, grain handlers
and exporters, as well as their customers
around the world, depend on accurate, timely
and cost-effective delivery of mandated impar-
tial third-party Official inspection and weighing
services administered by the Federal Grain In-
spection Service (FGIS) and its designated
and delegated agencies. It is essential that the
U.S. Official grain inspection and weighing
system be recognized widely around the world
for its impartial, consistent, reliable and timely
measurement and certification of quality at-
tributes and weights. The availability of accu-
rate FGIS inspection results is also important
to enable buyers and sellers to determine
grain value and to facilitate market price dis-
covery. Further, Official export inspections pro-
vide transparency and market information to
the entire value chain that contribute to an effi-
cient marketplace, while supporting food secu-
rity and sustainable supplies.
I share the concerns of many of my col-
leagues about language included in the com-
mittee report by the Majority for H.R. 3055 that
puts Congress in the middle of an ongoing
labor dispute, even going so far as to urge
that USDA not require its grain inspectors to
cross a picket line. This language is extremely
troubling, and Congress should not be includ-
ing it in any final committee report for the Agri-
culture Appropriations bill. Thankfully, the Mi-
nority was able to include its concerns about
the situation which I would like to include in
the RECORD:
‘‘In addition to overall funding concerns, Re-
publican Members of the Committee were dis-
appointed by several policy provisions. Some
of the provisions encourage violation of federal
law or Congressional intent, at a minimum.
For example, the Majority included language
under the heading of the Office of the Sec-
retary relating to Grain Export Inspection. The
language ‘‘strongly discourages USDA from
requiring its grain inspectors to cross a picket
line’’. Such language is irresponsible when the
Grain Inspections Act clearly obligates inspec-
tors to conduct inspections unless the Sec-
retary were to waive the requirement for safety
reasons. Using USDA inspectors in a labor
dispute and interfering with the export sales of
U.S. product during an already turbulent inter-
national trade environment is completely un-
necessary.’’
Our producers, grain handlers, and the agri-
cultural value chain as a whole has worked
tirelessly to grow market share around the
world and Congress should refrain from in-
structing USDA not to perform important serv-
ices that are statutorily obligated under the
Grain Standards Act.
IN APPRECIATION OF MARK
BENSON’S WORK IN IDAHO
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON
OF IDAHO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor a great friend to Idaho, Mark Benson,
who is retiring after a 42 year career with
PotlatchDeltic. The last 13 years he has been
Vice President, Public Affairs. However, his
title to me is a friend and trusted advisor.
I met Mark when I was in the Idaho Legisla-
ture. He quickly established himself as a valu-
able advisor on forestry and paper products
which is a large economic driver in Idaho.
Mark has the unique ability to explain an issue
and the impacts from every perspective and
gives always gives an honest assessment of
the status.
Mark worked at nearly every level of
PotlatchDeltic, starting as a field forester in
1974. He has left his mark on the industry and
will be remembered for founding the National
Alliance of Forest Owners who is a leading
voice on all the issues facing forestry.
Mark has been a great friend to my staff
and me. To Mark, PotlatchDeltic was not just
a job, it was a lifestyle and he treated his col-
leagues like family. Mark is also an incredible
husband and father as witnessed by his sup-
portive wife Patti and three amazing daughters
who now have families of their own. No doubt,
this will be the focal point of his retirement
alongside his many hobbies including golf,
hunting, and travel.
If I have one gripe with Mark, it is that he
never let me win on the golf course. As kind
and generous as he is, he could never seem
to find it in his heart to let a putt or two slide
by. Perhaps I will be able to change that now
that he has more time to hit the links.
I wish Mark and Patti and the rest of their
family a terrific and well-deserved retirement. I
look forward to keeping in touch with him as
a friend and seeing him back in Idaho.

HONORING LINDA TAVASZI, PH.D.
HON. JARED HUFFMAN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of Linda Tavaszi, Ph.D.,
as she receives Marin Community Clinics’
Lifetime Achievement Award for her decades
of exemplary service promoting community
health.
Born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1940, Dr.
Tavaszi lived in Florida and Alabama before
returning to New York to earn a graduate de-
gree in social work from Fordham University.
Dr. Tavaszi earned a masters in health admin-
istration from the University of Southern Cali-
fornia, and a Ph.D. in health care administra-
tion from Walden University in Florida. Dr.
Tavaszi began her life-long career in health
care, most of which was spent working in
Marin County.
Dr. Tavaszi came to Marin County as chief
operating officer at Marin General Hospital in
1982. Under her leadership, Marin General
opened a new emergency department and de-
veloped Marin’s first and only cardiac surgery
program. As president of the Health Council of
Marin and the local chapter of the American
Heart Association, Dr. Tavaszi’s commitment
and dedication to the community extended be-
yond her role at Marin General.
In 1994, Dr. Tavaszi was asked to oversee
an American-owned hospital in Barcelona,
Spain, where she and her family spent two
years helping steer that project to success.
Once back in California, Dr. Tavaszi oversaw
the mergers of two hospitals in the East Bay,
and she returned to Marin County as chief ex-
ecutive officer of Kentfield Rehabilitation Hos-
pital. After great success there, she returned
to Marin General in 2004. In 2011, Dr. Tavaszi
became CEO of Marin Community Clinics.
During her tenure at Marin Community Clinics,
Dr. Tavaszi expanded patient capacity and
comprehensive services for seniors and the
homeless population. From 2017 to 2018 Dr.
Tavaszi served as the chief executive officer
of Ritter Center where she provided valuable
assistance during a transition in leadership.
Madam Speaker, Dr. Tavaszi’s career of
leadership and vision has helped hospitals
and clinics in our region provide affordable,
high-quality health care to our most under-
served populations. Therefore, please join me
in recognizing Dr. Linda Tavaszi on her well-
deserved honor and in wishing her the best of
luck in her continuing pursuit of quality health
care for people in need.

COMMEMORATION OF THE TREE
OF PEACE
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate the planting of the
Tree of Peace on the grounds of the National
World War I Museum and Memorial in Kansas
City, Missouri. This ceremony is dignified by
the presence of Mr. Ross P. Marine, the Hon-
orary Consul of the Slovak Republic to the
Midwest United States and board member of
the Czech and Slovak Club of Greater Kansas
City. During his eighteen-year tenure as Hon-
orary Consul, Mr. Marine has worked to
strengthen the economic, social, and cultural
ties between Slovakia and Mid-America, and
this spirit of international cooperation is re-
flected by the Tree of Peace project. Since the
dedication of the National WWI Museum and
Memorial on Armistice Day in 1926, Kansas
City, Missouri has been home to the country’s
foremost institution committed to preserving
the history of the First World War. In the shad-
ows of the Liberty Memorial—the most fitting
location our country offers for this project—the
Tree of Peace will convey a message of good-
will and contribute to the reflective nature of
this consecrated site.
Between July 28, 1914 and November 11,
1918, the First World War claimed the lives of
nine million combatants and nearly eight mil-
lion civilians. Another twenty-one million mili-
tary personnel were wounded during the
course of the war. In the United States alone,
over 116,000 servicemen were killed, 204,000
were wounded, and 3,350 went missing.
Among the American casualties, 441 were
from Kansas City. To this day, World War I re-
mains among the most costly and destructive
wars in history.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E807
June 20, 2019
When the National WWI Museum and Me-
morial opened to the public in 1926, President
Calvin Coolidge explained that the memorial
had ‘‘not been raised to commemorate war
and victory, but rather the results of war and
victory, which are embodied in peace and lib-
erty.’’ The Tree of Peace project, initiated by
Slovak landscape architect Dr. Marek Sabala,
serves a similar purpose.
The Tree of Peace project is an inter-
national initiative that began in the Slovak Re-
public last year to mark the 100th anniversary
of the First World War’s conclusion. Within
four years, Dr. Sabala hopes to plant a Tree
of Peace on every continent, a mission de-
signed to champion a message of peace and
the need to avoid armed conflicts. Each Tree
of Peace also stands as a living tribute to all
those who fought and perished in World War
I, including those who lost their lives on un-
known battlefields and who remain known only
God. So far, eight Trees of Peace have been
planted in four participating countries: Austria,
Slovakia, Russia, and Poland. With the plant-
ing of a Tree of Peace at the National WWI
Museum and Memorial on June 21st, the
United States will join this international com-
munity in hopes of achieving a world free from
global conflict. At a National Historic Landmark
that has attracted over two million visitors
since 2006, the Tree of Peace will establish its
roots at one of the most treasured sites in
Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District and the
nation.
The motto of the Tree of Peace project, to
‘‘make love the lifeblood of this world,’’ articu-
lates an ideal that is antithetical to the deprav-
ity of warfare. Visitors to the National WWI
Museum and Memorial walk across a glass
bridge above a field of 9,000 red poppies—
each of which represents 1,000 combat
deaths suffered during the War. Conversely,
the Tree of Peace symbolizes belief in a future
where war no longer inflicts senseless death
on so many. World War I was described by
many contemporaries as ‘‘the war to end all
wars.’’ While the international community has
repeatedly proven this description false—with
graves all across the world bearing testament
to the devastating consequences of armed
conflict—the Tree of Peace expresses faith
that we may, once and for all, see war come
to an end.
The Liberty Memorial Tower is flanked by
two Assyrian Sphinx sculptures, known as
Memory and Future. While Memory shields its
eyes from the horrors of war, and Future
shields its eyes from the uncertainty of times
to come, the Tree of Peace affirms hope in a
future that need not cause one to cover one’s
eyes in fear.
The Tree of Peace project encourages each
of us to recommit ourselves to the noble pur-
suit of perpetual peace—in which bullets,
bombs, and bayonets are all set aside; hos-
tility is replaced with civility; and antagonism
gives way to amity. The Tree of Peace calls
on nations to silence the beating of their war
drums, cast away their rattling sabers, and
pay no heed to war hawks. Only then will the
‘‘just and lasting peace’’ that is described on
the north wall of the memorial become a re-
ality.
Madam Speaker, please join me in cele-
brating the planting of the Tree of Peace at
the National WWI Museum and Memorial in
Kansas City, Missouri. Let us recognize this
occasion by reflecting on the values of friend-
ship, harmony, and goodwill.

IN RECOGNITION OF NEW JERSEY
BUSINESS & INDUSTRY ASSOCIA-
TION’S EMPLOYER LEGISLATIVE
COMMITTEES AND FRANK ROBIN-
SON
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR.
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to join with the New Jersey Business & Indus-
try Association as they celebrate 60 years of
Employer Legislative Committees and pay trib-
ute to Frank Robinson for his 40 years of
service to New Jersey. These incredible mile-
stones and the New Jersey Business & Indus-
try Association’s efforts to support New Jersey
businesses are truly deserving of this body’s
recognition.
With a 40-year career spanning the public,
private and political sectors, Frank Robinson is
a well-known and well-respected face in Tren-
ton. He has served in leadership roles at the
New Jersey Democratic State Committee and
the New Jersey General Assembly, as well as
the 2001 New Jersey Congressional Re-dis-
tricting Commission. Currently serving as a
Vice President of Government Affairs for the
New Jersey Business & Industry Association
(NJBIA) since 2002, Frank has been an effec-
tive voice for New Jersey’s business commu-
nity. He is the longstanding Executive Director
of the State Employer Legislative Committees
(ELCs) as well as Director of the NJBIA’s
Grassroots Network. He also serves as a
member on the Monmouth-Ocean Develop-
ment Group Board of Directors and as a
Trustee of the Jersey Shore Partnership.
Throughout his tenure with the NJBIA and be-
yond, Frank has distinguished himself as an
advocate for the growth and viability of New
Jersey.
Established by the NJBIA in 1959, today’s
eighteen ELCs provide local representation
and accessibility to businesses in each county
across the state. Hosting regular meetings,
ELCs offer opportunities for business people
to meet with local, state and Federal officials,
hear directly from NJBIA’s knowledgeable gov-
ernment affairs representatives and network
with colleagues. ELCs provide an outlet for
local businesses to discuss issues and learn
about regulations and policies affecting their
industry and employees.
For over 100 years, the NJBIA has rep-
resented the common interests of New Jer-
sey’s manufacturing and business industry. It
continues to be a leading voice in New Jer-
sey’s state capital on industry affairs and an
effective advocate on behalf of its members.
Its information, programs and services are in-
valuable resources to companies and its un-
derstanding of laws and regulations help
NJBIA members navigate the changing indus-
try landscape. NJBIA’s efforts to promote and
expand New Jersey’s business community are
supported by its proficient and competent staff
and the successful information sharing of its
ELCs.
Madam Speaker, I sincerely hope my col-
leagues will join me in marking 60 years of
Employer Legislative Committees and hon-
oring Frank Robinson’s 40 years of dedicated
leadership to New Jersey.

IN RECOGNITION OF RANDOLPH
GOODMAN
HON. HENRY CUELLAR
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the career and service of Ran-
dolph Goodman. He recently retired after 26
years of work at Gary Job Corps.
Randolph Goodman was born and raised in
Austin, Texas. In 1968, while attending The
University of Texas at Arlington, he was in-
spired to join the Navy and serve his country
after the assassination of Robert Kennedy and
Dr. Martin Luther King.
After serving in the Navy for 20 years and
completing his double major in history and po-
litical science, Mr. Goodman began working at
Gary Job Corps as the Public Information Offi-
cer and Business Community Liaison.
The organization is dedicated to giving
young adults access to free academic and
technical career training. It puts young people
on the path to the American dream through
hard work and education. Not only does it set
them up for economic success—it gives them
the pride and purpose that comes from earn-
ing a diploma or technical certification and be-
ginning a meaningful career. The San Marcos
location, that Mr. Goodman served at, is the
largest Job Corps Center in the State of
Texas.
Throughout his 26 years at Gary Job Corps,
he has traveled to Washington, D.C. to advo-
cate for funding and ensure students have ac-
cess to the resources they need to thrive. Mr.
Goodman has credited his success and tenac-
ity during his time at Gary Job Corps to the
students he has represented.
In his free time, Mr. Goodman has also
served in many nonprofit organizations and
committees in San Marcos, Texas. However,
his believes his greatest success is marrying
his childhood sweetheart. Mr. Goodman and
his wife, Eva, will be celebrating their 49th
wedding anniversary this December.

HON. MIKE ROGERS
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker,
I ask for the House’s attention to recognize
the life of Mrs. Consuello ‘‘Connie’’ Harper.
Mrs. Harper, former president and CEO of
Central Alabama Opportunities Industrializa-
tion Center, passed away on June 17, 2019.
The program has helped train and equip
low-to-moderate income families in Central
Alabama since 1968. Mrs. Harper’s nationally
recognized self-help programs included pro-
viding women with non-traditional training in
highway construction and young adults with
Job Readiness Training.
Mrs. Harper’s daughter, Sylvia Harper, and
grandson, Retired Army Special Forces
‘‘Green Beret’’ Lieutenant Colonel Kali
McMurray, will continue OIC’s work.
Mrs. Harper also worked as an educator in
Macon County and served on the Macon
County School Board. Her husband, Socrates
Harper, is a retired educator and previously
served as District County Commissioner for
Macon County.
She was a lifelong resident of the Tysonville
community in Macon County.
Madam Speaker, please join me in com-
memorating the life of Mrs. Harper.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND MILI-
TARY SERVICE OF WORLD WAR
II VETERAN, JAMES E. HUDSON
HON. TRENT KELLY
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to celebrate the life and military
service of World War II Veteran James E.
Hudson. Mr. Hudson has always placed God
and family first in his life, offering friendship
and brotherly love to all those who crossed his
path.
Mr. Hudson was born on June 21, 1919, in
Tishomingo County, Mississippi. He spent his
childhood in Iuka, MS with his parents, Milton
and Florence Hudson, and his seven siblings.
Mr. Hudson graduated from Iuka High School
where he played on the basketball team.
Mr. Hudson was drafted to the United
States Army right out of high school in 1941.
He spent his basic training at Camp LeJeune,
North Carolina before being sent to Fort Bliss,
Texas, to serve in the First Calvary division,
also known as the Horse Calvary, of the
United States Army. Mr. Hudson was later de-
ployed to the Pacific theater where he went to
New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, the
Southern Philippines, and Luzon for 2 years.
He completed his service in 1945.
After the War, Mr. Hudson returned to Iuka,
Mississippi where he still resides to this day.
He married his sweetheart, Mae Romine from
Florence, Alabama and they had four children.
Mr. Hudson worked as a carpenter for TVA
building dams on the Tennessee River. He
has been blessed with thirteen grandchildren
and sixteen great-grandchildren.
Throughout his life and to this day, Mr. Hud-
son set an example for his children to follow.
Mr. Hudson, a lifelong Christian, is a Meth-
odist and attributes his 100 years of happiness
to Psalm 118:24: ‘‘This is the day which the
Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad
therein.’’
On June 21st of 2019, Mr. Hudson will cele-
brate his 100th birthday. Mr. Hudson is an
American patriot who served our great nation
and continues to set an example for others to
follow. We wish him many more years of good
health.

NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE
AWARENESS MONTH
HON. GRACE MENG
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise to com-
memorate National Gun Violence Awareness
Month. Since 2017, National Gun Violence
Awareness month has been celebrated annu-
ally in June.
For too long and too often we, as a nation,
have mourned with yet another community
that was tragically impacted by gun violence.
This is one community too many. Deaths from
mass shootings in the U.S. are increasing at
an alarming rate. After Sandy Hook, over
2,086 mass shootings have taken lives of
Americans. From the Tree of Life synagogue
in Pittsburgh to the gurdwara in Oak Creek;
from Sandy Hook Elementary to Stoneman
Douglas High School; from the Pulse Night
Club in Florida to the music festival shooting
in Las Vegas—these places and events have
sadly become memorialized. And there are
countless more victims of gun violence who
never made it to our news cycle.
Gun violence is indeed an epidemic. In ad-
dition to the lives lost, every bullet—every
gunshot—rips apart the fabric of a community.
For all those who were faced with gun vio-
lence—there is no going back. One such trag-
edy is one too many.
Victims of domestic abuse are especially
susceptible to gun violence. That is why we
must do all that we can to protect survivors of
dating violence and stalking. Currently, nearly
one million women alive today have been shot
or shot at by an intimate partner. Studies have
also shown that women experiencing situa-
tions where domestic abusers have access to
a gun are five times as likely to be fatally shot.
Women of color suffer from an even higher
risk of death in similar situations.
We cannot become desensitized to the
number of deaths in the news. We must act
now. That is why I was proud to help pass on
the floor of the House of Representatives H.R.
8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of
2019, and H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Back-
ground Checks Act to ensure universal back-
ground checks and close the Charleston loop-
hole that enabled the hate crime at Mother
Emanuel Church. In the 100 days of Senate’s
inaction and refusal to allow these bills a vote
on the Senate floor, 233 New Yorkers were
killed by gun violence. This—and every inci-
dent of gun violence—is a travesty.
No one should live their lives in constant
fear. No parent should have to fear for their
children as their kids go to school. No one
should fear if their presence in a place of wor-
ship or a theatre makes them vulnerable.
Madam Speaker, as we mark National Gun
Violence Awareness Month, we must be even
more emboldened to demand change now.
We need to remind the nation—including our
policymakers—of the lives that have been
taken by gun violence and the urgent need for
commonsense gun violence prevention. I call
on my colleagues in the Senate to pass H.R.
8 today. While National Gun Violence Aware-
ness Month occurs in June, we must fight
every single day of the year to prevent the
countless deaths caused by the lack of gun
restrictions. Thoughts and prayers are mean-
ingless without critical action. Enough is
enough.

June 20, 2019
RECOGNIZING LEOR TORCHMAN
AUERBACH FOR RECEIVING THE
SCOOP JACKSON AWARD
HON. MIKE QUIGLEY
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, in partner-
ship with my colleague, Congressman ADAM
KINZINGER, I rise to recognize Leor Torchman
Auerbach for being honored with the 2019
CityPAC Scoop Jackson Award. Her career
and service for over 20 years as an advocate
and leader in Chicago’s Pro-Israel advocacy
community make her an ideal recipient for this
honor. She has devoted her personal time and
professional career to strengthening the U.S.-
Israel relationship.
Since the 2000’s, Leor has served as a
longtime CityPAC Board member and her or-
ganizational and fund-raising approach set the
standard that CityPAC continues to emulate.
She has also served as the American Israel
Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) Chicago Co-
Chair of the Young Leadership Council in ad-
dition to her continuing role as an AIPAC Illi-
nois Council Member.
She leads Americans United in Support of
Democracy, a political action committee which
has organized more than one thousand com-
munity events for Members of Congress, culti-
vating bipartisan support for the U.S.-Israel re-
lationship.
Leor’s deep passion for Israel is reflected in
her work. As a granddaughter of Holocaust
survivors, she is a friend and supporter to the
entire community, and her activism is an inspi-
ration and model for us all.
Madam Speaker, we ask our colleagues to
join us in recognizing Leor Torchman
Auerbach for her receipt of the 2019 CityPAC
Scoop Jackson Award. She is an inspiring fig-
ure in our community and we thank her for her
years of service.

IMMIGRANT HERITAGE MONTH,
WORLD REFUGEE DAY, AND H.R.
2489, THE WAIVER ACCOUNT-
ABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY
ACT
HON. ELIJAH E. CUMMINGS
OF MARYLAND
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in celebration, of Immigrant Heritage
Month and World Refugee Day, which comes
at a time when this Administration is under-
taking unprecedented and cruel actions
against immigrants.
Each June, we recognize the enormous
contributions that immigrants have made to
our country. Our country is a nation of immi-
grants and during this month we acknowledge
their work in our military, as entrepreneurs, as
educators, and activists.
Today is also World Refugee Day.
This year, the United States will only accept
up to 30,000 refugees—a historically low num-
ber. In 2016, our country took in almost
85,000 refugees. We must do better.
As Americans of conscience, we must com-
mit ourselves to standing against any treat-
ment of immigrants and refugees that con-
tradicts our values of inclusion and support for
human rights.
This Administration has undertaken a
shameful immigration blueprint that has at-
tacked and demonized immigrants at every
turn. From the discriminatory Muslim Ban to
the cruel Family Separation Policy, these ac-
tions will forever be a stain on our nation’s his-
tory.
The immigration policies of this President
will also leave lasting scars for countless indi-
viduals and families. These include:
Children ripped away from their parents and
loved ones;
Veterans deported after bravely serving our
country;
Children in government custody who had
legal services, classes and recreation can-
celed;
DREAMers who have had their DACA pro-
tections stripped away; and
Immigrants at detention facilities with abhor-
rent conditions, including private prisons being
run by for-profit contractors.
We are better than this.
I am working to improve conditions at immi-
gration detention facilities. Immigrants in U.S.
custody should be treated with dignity and re-
spect. That is why I recently introduced the
Waiver Accountability and Transparency Act,
H.R. 2489.
My legislation will stop U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement’s abuse of a waiver
system that allows detention facilities to cir-
cumvent critical federal standards. Waiving
these standards endangers the health and
safety of tens of thousands of immigrants.
In January, the Department of Homeland
Security’s Office of the Inspector General re-
leased a report showing that ICE had no for-
mal policies to manage the waiver process
and it detailed egregious waivers granted by
ICE.
For example, ICE signed off on a waiver to
allow the for-profit contractor CoreCivic to use
CS gas, a chemical agent 10 times more toxic
than pepper spray, at the Otay Mesa Deten-
tion Center in California.
Furthermore, the Otero County Processing
Center in New Mexico was given a waiver by
ICE allowing them to commingle low-custody
and high-custody detainees. Detention stand-
ards prohibit commingling detainees with seri-
ous criminal histories with those who are non-
violent or have only committed immigration-re-
lated infractions.
My bill reforms ICE’s out-of-control waiver
process through increased transparency, ac-
countability, and oversight. ICE would need to
notify Congress and post online whenever a
waiver is granted. ICE’s leadership would
need to sign off on waivers. Waivers would no
longer be granted for indefinite amounts of
time and would need to be renewed every 90
days. In the most serious cases, a corrective
action plan must be in place before a waiver
could be granted.
We must do better. Those seeking a better
life are not criminals and must be treated with
dignity and respect.
As we recognize Immigrant Heritage Month
and World Refugee Day, it is vital to not only
reflect on and celebrate the contributions of
immigrants to our country, but to also act
against this Administration’s anti-immigrant
policies.
IN HONOR OF A&W RESTAURANTS
HON. ANDY BARR
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to cele-
brate the oldest franchise restaurant in Amer-
ica—A&W. Today is its 100th birthday. As the
automobile opened new horizons for Ameri-
cans, A&W Restaurants pioneered the drive-in
restaurant and made the Root Beer Float a
household treat.
These small businesses are a source of
fond memories for generations of Americans.
A&W’s beloved mascot Rooty the Great Root
Bear is known from coast to coast.
A&W opened doors of opportunity so people
could start their own businesses as franchise
owners. These iconic restaurants became
hubs in towns across America, and A&W de-
veloped a culture of giving back, reflecting the
very best of heartland values.
Today begins their annual fundraising drive
for Disabled American Veterans. A&W has
raised over $800,000 for veteran-related char-
ities since 2011.
A&W is owned by its franchise partners,
who independently operate nearly 600 U.S.
restaurants. The National A&W Franchisee
Association headquarters is located in Rich-
mond, Kentucky.
Madam Speaker, please join me today in
welcoming the A&W family to Washington to
celebrate their 100th Anniversary.

RECOGNIZING ALICE RODRIGUEZ
HON. BILL FLORES
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Alice Rodriguez of Waco, Texas,
who recently retired from the Waco City Coun-
cil.
Alice was first elected to the Waco City
Council in 1991. At the time of her election,
she was the first Hispanic woman on the city
council. She served for 10 years before taking
a break from 2001 to 2005. In 2005, she ran
again and served for another 14 years. Her
combined years of service make her the long-
est serving councilmember in Waco’s history.
Alice was first encouraged to run for office
to make a change in her community. Inspired
by her father, and recalling the difficulties
faced by the Hispanic community, she wanted
to advocate for equality for minorities and
Wacoans facing hardship.
During her career on the city council, Alice
was a passionate voice for her constituents.
While she supported forward looking policies
to conserve neighborhoods and bring more
opportunities for low-income families, Alice
also wanted to preserve the past.
Alice was instrumental in the foundation of
the Waco Hispanic Museum that opened in
2016. Alice wanted current and future genera-
tions to remember the strides made by the
Hispanic community in Waco and appreciate
their struggle for equality.
In addition to serving on the Waco City
Council, Alice has served on the boards of
several organization including National League

IN RECOGNITION OF ELIZABETH
‘‘BETSY’’ BARRETT
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR.
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Ms. Elizabeth ‘‘Betsy’’ Barrett as
she is honored by the Sandy Hook Foundation
for her years of service. It is my pleasure to
join with the Sandy Hook Foundation in thank-
ing Ms. Barrett for her tenure as President and
her continued service on the Board of Trust-
ees. Ms. Barrett’s exemplary leadership and
contributions to the Sandy Hook Foundation
and the greater Monmouth County area are
truly deserving of this body’s recognition.
Throughout her many years with the Sandy
Hook Foundation, Ms. Barrett has been a tire-
less advocate for the park and its historical
and ecological importance. Under her leader-
ship, the Sandy Hook Foundation has assisted
the National Park Service in preserving valu-
able landmarks and highlighting the area’s
recreational offerings to attract thousands of
visitors to the park. At her direction, the Foun-
dation provided resources for the renovations
of the deteriorating Sandy Hook Lighthouse
Keepers Quarters and Superstorm Sandy-
damaged History House along Fort Hancock’s
Officer’s Row. Additionally, following
Superstorm Sandy’s destruction on Sandy
Hook, Ms. Barrett mobilized the Foundation to
assist park staff and emergency personnel as
they tackled the needs associated with re-
opening the park, helping navigate logistical
challenges and bringing food to the site.
From her hands-on help after Superstorm
Sandy to her friendly assistance to visitors
needing directions, Ms. Barrett is deeply in-
volved with the success and vitality of Sandy
Hook. Her leadership and hard work have
greatly benefited the park and its visitors. Her
efforts as President of the Sandy Hook Foun-
dation are valuable to our community and help
ensure that this historical and natural site is
available for future generations to enjoy.
Madam Speaker, once again, please join
me in thanking Betsy Barrett for her years as
President of the Sandy Hook Foundation and
her continued support and involvement.
IN HONOR OF DORIS IRENE
PROULX
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Doris Irene Proulx, who is being
honored as the Franco-American of the year
by the Franco-American Centre of New Hamp-
shire. The Franco-American Centre of New
Hampshire is a non-profit working to preserve
the rich heritage of French communities in
New Hampshire by promoting history, culture,
and education of their historic, cultural, and ar-
tistic contributions. A proud member of the
Franco-American community, Doris has
served our state with unbridled distinction, as
a school guidance counselor, through constant
community service, and active involvement in
her faith community.
Doris Irene Proulx was born and raised in
Manchester, growing up in a bilingual French/
English household. She served the community
in a professional capacity for 38 years as a
guidance counselor at Manchester High
School West, including 21 years as Director of
Guidance. During this time, she earned the
NH Excellence in Education Award for Guid-
ance and was named Counselor of the Year.
Throughout her life, she has been a com-
mitted public servant, serving as a former
president of both the Manchester Women’s
Club and the Richelieu Club of Manchester.
She is also a Goodwill Ambassador and is an
active Member of the Franco-American Cen-
tre.
Doris continued to serve her faith commu-
nity as a former president of the Missionary
Rosebushes, Cardinal Lacroix Academy Advi-
sory Board, Lady of the Equestrian Order of
the Holy Sepulcher of Jerusalem, and cur-
rently serves as a section representative for
the Diocese of Manchester. Additionally, she
has been a lector in both English and French
at St. Ann-St. Augustin and St. Anthony
Churches for over 18 years.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to
thank Doris for her decades of dedication to
our community. I congratulate her again on
this well-deserved honor, and I thank her for
all that she does to make our state such a
wonderful place to learn, live, and grow.

CALLING ON VIETNAM TO
RELEASE MICHAEL NGUYEN
HON. BRAD SHERMAN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, I want to
join my colleagues, especially KATIE PORTER
who has shown exceptional leadership on this
important issue, in calling on Vietnam to re-
lease Michael Nguyen and allow him to return
home to his family.
Born in Vietnam, Michael left the country in
1975 and is a U.S. citizen who lives in my
home state of California. Michael has lived in
the United States for decades and has no
criminal record. In fact, he has been an exem-
plary citizen. Besides being a business owner
and committed family man, Michael is active in
his church and his community.
In July 2018, Michael traveled to Vietnam to
visit elderly family members. He had regularly
gone on trips to Vietnam. This time, however,
Michael was detained and imprisoned by the
Vietnamese police. It was over a week before
Vietnam even acknowledged Michael had
been detained. Then, for nearly a year, his
family, the American consulate, and con-
cerned members of Congress were given no
information about his alleged wrongdoings. In-
stead, despite repeated inquiries into the na-
ture of his alleged crimes, the Vietnamese au-
thorities kept stating that he was under inves-
tigation. It is a red flag that Michael was im-
prisoned for months and months without being
formally charged with a crime. Making matters
worse, he was not allowed to speak or see his
family members, nor was he given access to
an attorney.
Only recently was Michael officially indicted
on the vague charge of carrying out activities
against the Vietnamese government. Although
Michael’s trial is expected to begin later this
month, his alleged transgressions are appar-
ently still a state secret in Vietnam.
As Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Subcommittee on Asia, I hope to strengthen
the U.S.-Vietnamese relationship. Our two
countries have many common interests. De-
spite the scars of history, we have a bur-
geoning friendship. Many U.S. companies
have large operations in Vietnam—including
Nike, Adidas, Under Armour, Levi’s, and Con-
verse—helping to propel Vietnam’s extraor-
dinary economic growth.
Michael’s unjust imprisonment jeopardizes
this progress. To avoid that outcome, the Viet-
namese government should immediately re-
lease Michael and allow him to return home to
his family in California. That would be a win-
win outcome for the United States and Viet-
nam. Most importantly, it would bring an end
to the unimaginable tragedy Michael’s loving
wife and children have had to endure over the
last year.

CELEBRATING THE 150TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE CITY OF
MANISTEE
HON. JACK BERGMAN
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it’s my
honor to recognize the city of Manistee upon
the occasion of its 150th Anniversary. Through
one and a half centuries of community invest-
ment and growth, Manistee has become an in-
dispensable part of Northern Michigan.
The first Europeans to settle in what was
eventually called Manistee were Jesuit mis-
sionaries in the 18th century. By the mid-
1800s, the settlement had grown into a suc-
cessful hub for the fur and lumber trades in
the region. While the town was nearly de-
stroyed by the Great Michigan Fire in 1871,
the city of Manistee would recover and evolve
over the following century and a half into the
jewel of Northern Michigan that it is today.
In honor of Manistee’s sesquicentennial, the
Manistee County Historical Museum is hosting
a variety of events and celebrations through-
out the year. The festivities kicked off in Feb-
ruary with the ‘‘Fun with the Founding Fa-
thers’’ event, where visitors learned about the
incorporation of the city of Manistee, the first
city council, and the people that made
Manistee what it is today. The closing cere-
monies for the year-long festivities will be in
December, with the ‘‘Wintertime in the City’’
exhibit of photographs showing the winter sea-
son in Manistee over the last 150 years.
Madam Speaker, day after day, the city of
Manistee continues to set a positive example
of what can be achieved when the people of
a community work together for the common
good. It’s my honor to congratulate them for
their 150 years of success and community
growth. On behalf of my constituents, I wish
Manistee all the best as it ventures into the fu-
ture.

the type of cleats you wear; winning is about
character on and off the fleld alongside hard
work and commitment to one’s team.
The Prosper Eagles showed their dedication
to these values from the very beginning.
I know I speak on behalf of our entire com-
munity when I say, the city of Prosper is

crosse team on their successful season.

SPEECH OF
HON. MARK TAKANO
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 19, 2019
The House in Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union had under
consideration the bill (H.R. 3055) making ap-
propriations for the Departments of Com-
merce and Justice, Science, and Related
Agencies for the fiscal year ending Sep-
tember 30, 2020, and for other purposes:
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Chair, I rise in sup-
port of En Bloc Amendment No. 2, which in-
cludes my language that makes clear the in-
tent of Congress to maintain federal protec-
tions under the Civil Rights Act.
Since 1964, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
has prohibited discrimination on the basis of
race, color, and national origin in all federally
funded programs and activities. It is the law of
the land. Unfortunately, there have been wide-
spread efforts by this Administration to roll
back protections under Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act. Rollback of any parts of the Civil
Rights Act, including Title VI, would have a
devastating impact on countless people.
It is the intent of Congress to instruct that all
federal agencies vigorously enforce and imple-
ment the civil rights protections guaranteed
under Title VI and Congress will be opposed
to any and all efforts to undermine these pro-
tections whether intentional or not.

RECOGNIZING INTERFAITH TAMPA
BAY ON THEIR FIFTH ANNUAL
INTERFAITH PRIDE WORSHIP
SERVICE
HON. CHARLIE CRIST
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. CRIST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing
Interfaith Tampa Bay on their fifth annual
Interfaith Pride Worship Service in St. Peters-
burg, Florida. I am honored to represent such
an inclusive and diverse district. This worship
service demonstrates that an attitude of not
just tolerance, but acceptance, is shared by
our faith leaders of all beliefs and back-
grounds.
Interfaith Tampa Bay is an organization unit-
ing faith leaders and believers of different reli-
gious backgrounds, coming together in prayer,
service, and mutual support. The Pride Wor-
ship Service, taking place within the city-wide
celebration of St. Pete Pride, gives LGBTQ
members of the faith community an oppor-
tunity to worship and celebrate God’s love sur-
rounded by those who accept and support
them. The Pride Worship Service invites all in
attendance to worship at the altar of compas-
sion, kindness, and understanding.
Hosted by King of Peace Metropolitan Com-
munity Church in St. Petersburg, Florida, the
Pride Worship Service features leaders of the
Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist faiths.
This service is proceeded by a Pride March
through the streets of the city to the steps of
the church, demonstrating the interconnectivity
between faith, pride, and self-love. It is a mes-
sage to all that one need not choose between
their faith and their identity, and that it is only
when we are able to truly love ourselves that
we are able to love God.
Through the Pride Worship Service and
other community gatherings, Interfaith Tampa
Bay is fostering a sense of community be-
tween the faith communities in our region, and
reestablishing the church, mosque, syna-
gogue, and other houses of worship as places
of love and enlightenment for all. Recently, the
organization hosted the Tampa Bay Iftar Din-
ner to celebrate the Muslim observance of
Ramadan and recognize the achievements of
Tampa Bay’s Muslim community. In light of re-
cent incidences of violence within these sa-
cred spaces, the role of Interfaith Tampa Bay
and similar institutions is incredibly important
in the fight against intolerance and hate.
On behalf of my Tampa Bay neighbors, I
want to recognize Interfaith Tampa Bay, King
of Peace MCC, Allendale UMC, Congregation
B’Nai Israel, and all participating faith organi-
zations for their support of the LGBTQ com-
munity.

HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 20, 2019
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to correct the official record regarding two of
my recorded votes from yesterday’s House
consideration of H.R. 2740, the Departments
of Labor, Health and Human Services, and
Education, and Related Agencies Appropria-
tions Act of 2020.
During the chamber’s recorded vote on
House Amendment 379 I voted aye rather no,
which was not my intention. Further, although
I was not able to cast a vote-for House
Amendment 381, I wish to note that I would
have voted aye.

SPEECH OF
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 19, 2019
The House in Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union had under
consideration the bill (H.R. 3055) making ap-
propriations for the Departments of Com-
merce and Justice, Science, and Related
Agencies for the fiscal year ending Sep-
tember 30, 2020, and for other purposes:
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Chair, my amend-
ment would place a funding limitation on the
Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to
utilize the Title 42 hiring authority.
The Title 42 hiring authority gives the De-
partment of Health and Human Services
(HHS) the ability to incentivize and expedite
the recruitment of scientists and other experts
working in the cutting edge of public health.
Congress authorized this authority for HHS
alone in the 1940s. However, in 2006, this au-
thority was extended to the Environmental
Protection Agency by an appropriations bill—
it did not go through the authorization process.
A 2015 report by the EPA’s Office of In-
spector General discovered that the EPA did
not properly demonstrate a need to use the
Title 42 hiring authority, nor did it provide clear
and convincing justification for its continued
use. As of 2015, the total annual salary for
EPA Title 42 appointments is between $3.5
million and $6.75 million. This is just further
evidence that the EPA’s use of the Title 42
hiring authority must come to an end. The
ability of the EPA to hire outside of the regular
General Services scale must first go through
regular order.
I urge support for this amendment so that
Congress has the time to fully review this
problematic hiring authority before appro-
priating additional funding.
