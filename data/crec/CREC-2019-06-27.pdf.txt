PRAYER
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer:
God, You created us endowed with
freedom. We give You thanks for giving
us another day.
As Congress heads into a recess to
celebrate the Fourth of July, Amer-
ica’s national holiday, may all citizens
be mindful of the wonder of our Na-
tion’s inception.
Men and women of goodwill from var-
ious backgrounds and sections of the
Colonies from disparate faith tradi-
tions came together in prayer and
united by a vision of political and eco-
nomic autonomy, courageously placed
their lives, their liberty, and their for-
tunes on the line to found these United
States.
May all Americans be renewed in
their commitment to our representa-
tive government. May each American
expect of themselves intelligent par-
ticipation in the political process so
that the Members of Congress they
elect might be statesmen and -women
who are able to represent the interests
of their constituents while also faith-
fully honoring their oath to defend the
Constitution in doing what is best for
our Nation.
In all the celebrations of this week to
come, may all that is done be for Your
greater honor and glory.
Amen.

VIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF
THE SENATE AMENDMENT TO
H.R. 3401, EMERGENCY SUPPLE-

IT IS TIME TO PUT HARRIET
TUBMAN ON THE $20 BILL
(Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam
Speaker, it is time to put Harriet Tub-
man on the $20 bill.
The Treasury has had this design in
the works for years, and now, all of a
sudden, it is backpedaling. It takes 10
years, they say, to complete this work.
During a 10-year period, Harriet Tub-
man made 19 round trips on the under-
ground railroad to lead over 300 slaves
to freedom; and, in less time, Treasury
can’t put this American hero on a piece
of paper.
How long must it take to reflect our
Nation’s rich diversity on our cur-
rency?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5206 June 27, 2019
How long must it take to recognize
an icon of freedom and courage?
How long must it take to rightfully
acknowledge the work of a woman who
helped countless enslaved Americans of
African descent?
How long must it take when the
American people overwhelmingly se-
lected her as the face of the new $20
bill?
Harriet Tubman embodies the Amer-
ican spirit of strength and hope.
It is time to put a woman on the $20
bill. In this year, the 100th anniversary
of women’s suffrage, we want to guar-
antee that Treasury will follow
through on this promise and this com-
mitment.
f
RECOGNIZING DUBOIS AREA
MIDDLE SCHOOL
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize the hardworking students, teach-
ers, and staff at DuBois Area Middle
School. For the fourth consecutive
time, DuBois Area Middle School was
one of over 465 schools from around the
country named as a school to watch by
the National Forum to Accelerate Mid-
dle-Grades Reform.
The Schools to Watch recognition is
based on a comprehensive 3-year review
of the entire school. Only one other
middle school in Pennsylvania has re-
mained at the top with DuBois for
their continuous designations.
The students, teachers, and faculty
members have joined together to cre-
ate a learning community where every-
one is supported. Every year, the com-
munity is challenged to maintain their
success by continuing to put their best
foot forward. This week, they were rec-
ognized for their 12 years of excellence
at the National Forum Schools to
Watch Conference here in Washington,
D.C.
I look forward meeting representa-
tives from the DuBois Area Middle
School later today. Madam Speaker,
the entire 15th Congressional District
of Pennsylvania is proud of their con-
tinuous success.
f
CRISIS AT THE BORDER
(Ms. SPEIER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, this is
not my America. This is not the values
of our America. Look at this picture.
Now, some critics think that this
should not have been published, but I
disagree, because these people are not
rapists or murderers or drug dealers.
This is Oscar Ramirez and his 23-
month-old daughter, Angie Valeria.
They died on the Rio Grande River,
Angie clinging to Oscar’s neck and
tucked under his shirt in a desperate
attempt to survive.
Their story isn’t unique. Last Satur-
day, a mother and three children were
found dead on U.S. soil. Children have
been found freezing. We now know that
many of them don’t even have simple
items of hygiene like soap and tooth-
brushes.
A group of women from my district,
20 of them, created a nonprofit called
Bay Area Border Relief. They are in
McAllen right now. They took 490
boxes of clothes, and it was actually re-
duced in less than 2 weeks.
We need to address this issue now.
f
RECOGNIZING LIEUTENANT GEN-
ERAL ROBERT SCOTT WILLIAMS
ON HIS RETIREMENT
(Mr. DUNN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Lieutenant General
Robert Scott Williams as he retires
after 32 years of service to the United
States Air Force.
On June 20, General Williams com-
pleted his tour as dual commander of
Air Forces Northern and First Air
Force headquarters at Tyndall Air
Force Base, capping a long and distin-
guished career.
His service to the Air Force included
a tour as commander of the 169th Oper-
ations Group and Fighter Wing at
McEntire Joint National Guard Base in
South Carolina.
General Williams’ leadership during
and after Hurricane Michael was top
tier. He and his team at Tyndall Air
Force Base overcame numerous obsta-
cles and exceeded expectations by
opening First Air Force headquarters
way ahead of schedule. This is only 2
short months after the category 5
storm Michael devastated the pan-
handle.
Madam Speaker, I applaud the work
he has accomplished over his last 3
years of command and his 32-year ca-
reer. Please join me in saluting Lieu-
tenant General Robert Scott Williams
for his great service to the Air Force.
f
RECOGNIZING AMERICAN GROWN
FLOWERS MONTH
(Ms. PINGREE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, I
rise in recognition of July as American
Grown Flowers Month.
As co-chair of the House Cut Flowers
Caucus, I know the buy local move-
ment has encouraged customers to buy
not only their food, but also their flow-
ers, from local farmers. People want to
support the small family farm down
the road, whether it is lettuce or lilies.
The cut flower industry creates jobs,
benefits our local economies, and natu-
rally encourages us to embrace our
planet’s natural beauty.
For farmers, cut flowers allow us to
preserve open spaces, participate in
sustainable agriculture, and, many
times, support women-owned busi-
nesses.
In my home State of Maine, where I
represent many small farms, more than
250 farms sell cut flowers, from the
Snell Family Farm in Buxton to Lazy
Acres Farm in Farmingdale.
This is an industry worth upwards of
$1 million to our economy and has seen
such rapid growth in recent years that
we have many flower CSAs for local
customers. The new interest in locally
sourced flowers has allowed farmers to
diversify their crops and boost their in-
come.
In Maine, nationally recognized as
‘‘Vacationland,’’ cut flowers are essen-
tial to our tourism industry. Flowers
decorate wedding venues, hotels, and
restaurants across our State. And when
you are celebrating something as spe-
cial as a wedding or a long-awaited va-
cation, shouldn’t everything, down to
the flowers on the table, have some
meaning?
f
RECOGNIZING PARALYMPIC
ATHLETE LIZZI SMITH
(Mr. PENCE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize an individual from
Muncie, Indiana, who has made her
community and State proud.
Lizzi Smith, a Paralympic athlete
who competed in the 2016 Paralympic
Games, is now working toward her goal
of swimming in the 2020 Paralympic
Games in Tokyo.
Lizzi has already accomplished so
much in her swimming career. She
helped Muncie Central High School win
a sectional in high school. She won two
world medals at the age of 17, and she
came away from the 2016 Paralympics
with two medals. Just this year, Lizzi
set the Pan American record in the S10
100-meter butterfly.
I thank Lizzi for inspiring us to
dream big and for setting a strong ex-
ample for young Hoosiers and all
Americans. I wish her the best of luck
on the road to Tokyo.
Bring home the gold.
f
HIGHLIGHTING THE DAIRY
MARGIN COVERAGE PROGRAM
(Mr. DELGADO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. DELGADO. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to acknowledge the end of
Dairy Month, which is recognized
throughout June. I also rise to high-
light the USDA’s new Dairy Margin
Coverage program, which is enrolling
farmers right now.
My district in upstate New York is
home to hundreds of dairy farmers, and
way too many are struggling to survive
with years of plummeting milk prices.
Now at the mercy of not just a com-
plex pricing system, but also trade
wars, our farmers need real support. I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5207
June 27, 2019
encourage all dairy farmers in New
York’s 19th Congressional District to
begin making coverage decisions.
The Dairy Margin Coverage program
is retroactive until the beginning of
the year, with applicable payments fol-
lowing soon after enrollment.
As dairy farmers continue to face low
prices and increased market consolida-
tion, I hope this program will provide
much-needed support during this chal-
lenging farm economy.
As a member of the Agriculture Com-
mittee, I am deeply committed to sup-
porting our dairy farmers, and I will be
closely following implementation of
the Dairy Margin Coverage program. I
will continue fighting to give our farm-
ers the support and the certainty they
need.

RECOGNIZING JUDY GENSHAFT
(Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker,
today I rise to recognize Dr. Judy
Genshaft, a truly outstanding leader
whose contributions to the Tampa Bay
area as the sixth president of the Uni-
versity of South Florida have been un-
matched, in my opinion.
President Genshaft has completely
transformed USF by helping it achieve
elite status as a preeminent research
university. The National Science Foun-
dation has ranked USF as one of the
Nation’s top 25 research universities.
Under Judy’s leadership, USF has
nearly quadrupled its research port-
folio to expand lifesaving research and
develop cutting-edge technologies. The
school’s success has attracted some of
the brightest young minds to the
Tampa Bay area of Florida, growing
enrollment by 40 percent, and USF’s
graduation rate has tripled with Dr.
Genshaft at the helm.
Summarizing the many accomplish-
ments of President Genshaft in just 1
minute is impossible. She is a remark-
able woman who has made the Tampa
Bay region a better place. As she pre-
pares to retire, it is my honor to say
congratulations to her.
Go Bulls.
f
CARING FOR THE CHILDREN
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, there is
a Gospel reading I like: Matthew 25:
‘‘For I was hungry and You gave me
food, I was thirsty and You gave me
drink, a stranger and You welcomed
me, naked and You clothed me, ill and
You cared for me, in prison and You
visited me.’’
That spirit of welcoming and compas-
sion is a part of what defines us as
Americans. In fact, we have enshrined
it in our legal code, including laws re-
quiring safe and sanitary conditions for
migrant children. Yet right now, chil-
dren are imprisoned in appalling and
unconscionable conditions.
These children have not been wel-
comed in the spirit of Matthew. In-
stead, they are in cages, in prison with-
out adequate food, clean clothing,
clean diapers, toothbrushes, access to
showers, and a comfortable place to lay
their head.
‘‘Whatever you did unto the least of
these, you did unto me.’’
Madam Speaker, we will be judged as
a nation, as a government, and a people
for our failure to look out for the least
of these. May this imprisonment end.

SECURING AMERICA’S FEDERAL
ELECTIONS ACT
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, pur-
suant to House Resolution 460, I call up

hand. The paper ballot shall be printed or
marked in such a way that vote selections, in-
cluding all vote selections scanned by voting
systems to tabulate votes, can be inspected and
verified by the voter without training or instruc-
tion or audited by election officials without the

with an opportunity to correct any error on the

makes it possible, at any time after the ballot
has been cast, to associate a voter with the

consent.

GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and to insert extraneous mate-
rial on H.R. 2722.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California?
There was no objection.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 2722. The SAFE Act is crit-
ical legislation to invest in and up-
grade the machinery of American de-
mocracy. It will help us combat the na-
tional emergency facing our country.
It will improve the resilience of elec-
tion infrastructure used in Federal
elections.
Aging equipment, under-resourced ju-
risdictions, and interference by foreign
entities or non-state actors leaves the
system vulnerable to exploitation that
can undermine confidence in election
outcomes. Ineffective and vulnerable
equipment can also discourage partici-
pation in Federal elections.
It comes to the floor after the Com-
mittee on House Administration held
three hearings in the first 6 months of
this year that addressed the integrity
of our elections. In February the com-
mittee held the ‘‘For the People: Our
American Democracy’’ hearing, where
the integrity of our democracy—in-
cluding critical steps to improve the
security and reliability of our election
infrastructure—was addressed.
On May 8 the committee held an elec-
tion security hearing where we heard
testimony about the urgent need to up-
grade our election infrastructure and
the lack of ongoing investment in the
wake of new threats.
And on May 21 the committee held an
oversight hearing of the Election As-
sistance Commission, an agency that
plays a central role in supporting elec-
tion administration in this country.
I will remind this House that earlier
this year, the Director of National In-
telligence published a report stating
that our adversaries and strategic com-
petitors ‘‘probably already are looking
to the 2020 U.S. elections as an oppor-
tunity to advance their interests.
‘‘They may also use cyber means to
‘directly manipulate or disrupt elec-
tions systems—such as by tampering
with voter registration or disrupting
the vote tallying process—either to
alter data or to call into question our
voting process.’’’
Last year he said that ‘‘the warning
lights are blinking red’’. . . .
Special Counsel Robert Mueller
noted in Volume One of his report that
the Russian military ‘‘targeted individ-
uals and entities involved in the ad-
ministration of the elections. Victims
included U.S. State and local entities,
such as State boards of elections, sec-
retaries of State, and county govern-
ments, as well as individuals who
worked for those entities. The GRU
also targeted private technology firms
responsible for manufacturing and ad-
ministering election-related software
and hardware, such as voter registra-
tion software and electronic polling
stations.’’
In April, FBI Director Christopher
Wray called Russia’s interference ef-
forts a ‘‘significant counterintelligence
threat,’’ and said that the 2018 mid-
terms were a ‘‘dress rehearsal for the
big show’’ of the 2020 Presidential elec-
tions.
Early voters in Georgia in 2018 saw
machines deleting votes and switching
them to other candidates. The ma-
chines where voters saw this occur
were purchased in 2002. During early
voting in Texas in 2018 some electronic
voting machines deleted votes and
switched them between candidates. The
machines were used in 78 of 254 Texas
counties.
In June of 2016 the Russian GRU com-
promised the computer network of the
Illinois State Board of Elections by ex-
ploiting a vulnerability in their
website. They gained access to a data-
base with information on millions of Il-
linois voters and extracted data on
thousands before the activity was de-
tected.
H.R. 2722 responds to this emergency
that we find ourselves in as a nation.
We ought to be doing everything we
can to bolster the security and integ-
rity of our elections from interference
and hacking.
The bill’s section 102 requires that
States transition to voting systems
that use individual, durable, voter-
verified paper ballots, which means a
paper ballot marked by the voter by
hand or through the use of a non-tab-
ulating ballot marking device or sys-
tem. Voter-verified paper ballots are
the best way to ensure that a voter’s
ballot accurately reflects their choices
and is counted as cast. Paper can be
audited. In the last Presidential elec-
tion, approximately 20 percent of reg-
istered voters cast their ballot on vot-
ing machines that do not have any
kind of paper backup.
The National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine concluded
that paperless systems ‘‘should be re-
moved from service as soon as pos-
sible.’’
In at least 40 States, elections are
carried out using machines that are at
least a decade old. And like any tech-
nology, they are susceptible to increas-
ing failure with age. One witness at our
election security hearing, Lawrence
Norden of the Brennan Center for Jus-
tice at NYU Law School, explained
that some State officials have ‘‘had to
turn to eBay to find critical compo-
nents like dot-matrix printer ribbons,
decades old storage devices, and analog
modems.’’ Aging systems also fre-
quently rely on unsupported software
like Windows XP and 2000, which may
not receive regular security patches
and are thus more vulnerable to the
latest methods of cyberattack.
This bill addresses many other cyber-
security best practices besides paper-
based systems.
The bill in section 111 authorizes a
$600 million Election Assistance Com-
mission grant program to assist States
in securing election infrastructure.
States may use the money to replace
their aging equipment with voter-
verified paper ballot voting systems,
but also ongoing maintenance of elec-
tion infrastructure, enhanced cyberse-
curity and operations of IT infrastruc-
ture, and enhanced cybersecurity of
voter registration systems.
Originally, the bill, as introduced,
would have authorized $1 billion for
this initial round of surge funding;
however, during the Committee on
House Administration’s markup, the
committee approved an amendment in
the nature of a substitute that author-
ized $600 million instead. Combined
with the $380 million that Congress ap-
propriated last year in election secu-
rity grants, this funding reaches the $1
billion that experts have said is nec-
essary to implement these necessary
protections.

The bill also provides in section 111
$175 million in biennial maintenance
funding. Cybersecurity threats will not
dissipate, they will only evolve. State
election officials have told us repeat-
edly they need more funding and a sus-
tainable source of funding.
Section 103 of the SAFE Act fosters
innovation for voters living with dis-
abilities. It provides grant funding for
the study, development, and testing of
accessible paper ballot voting, verifica-
tion, and casting mechanisms. It ex-
pressly requires States to ensure that
individuals with disabilities and others
are given an equivalent opportunity to
vote, including with privacy and inde-
pendence, in a manner that produces
voter-verified paper ballots as for other
voters.
The bill fosters accountability for
election technology vendors. It would
create a qualified election infrastruc-
ture vendor designation where the
Election Assistance Commission, in co-
ordination with the Department of
Homeland Security, would craft cri-
teria that vendors would follow to re-
ceive the qualified designation. This
would include reporting any known or
suspected cybersecurity incidents in-
volving election infrastructure to both
the EAC and DHS, as well as affected
election agencies.
The bill in sections 201 and 203 also
includes open-source provisions, re-
quiring use of software and hardware
for which information is disclosed by
manufacturers. This will allow cyberse-
curity experts and the public to vet the
security of election systems regardless
of the technology used.
As amended in the committee, the
bill in section 121 requires States to
adopt risk-limiting audits. Risk-lim-
iting audits are the gold standard of
post-election audits. They involve hand
counting a certain number of ballots
using advanced statistical methods to
determine with a high degree of con-
fidence that the reported election out-
come is accurate. The SAFE Act re-
quires States to implement risk-lim-
iting audits because they go hand in
hand with paper ballots. We need au-
dits to ensure that ballot marking de-
vices or optical scanners were not
hacked and that the reported results
are accurate.
Second, as amended in committee,
the bill in section 201 includes specific
cybersecurity standards to apply to op-
tical scanner voting systems and an-
other set of standards to apply to bal-
lot marking devices. These will apply
equally to current and future tech-
nology. For example, H.R. 2722 pro-
hibits the use of wireless communica-
tions devices and internet connectivity
in voting systems upon which ballots
are marked by voters or that otherwise
mark and tabulate ballots.
Madam Speaker, H.R. 2722 is an es-
sential step forward in shoring up our
election infrastructure and investing in
secure elections. I ask the House to
pass this legislation and bolster the
trust and confidence in our system
that all Americans expect and deserve.
Every American—no matter what
their choice in politics—should know
that their vote will be counted as cast.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such
time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, in the 2016 election,
we saw a very real threat to our Nation
when Russia interfered in our elections
by using a misinformation campaign
through social media and attacking
voter registration databases. While
this interference from Russia is unac-
ceptable, I feel it is necessary to point
out that there is no evidence that any
voting machines were hacked in the
2016 or even in the 2018 elections.
However, this does not mean that
there isn’t a need for election and cy-
bersecurity improvements for State
election systems. On this point, I know
my friends and colleagues on the other
side of the aisle, including the distin-
guished chairperson of our Committee
on House Administration, we all agree
that no one—and I mean, no one—
should interfere with our elections.
Every Americans’ vote should be
counted and protected.
Last Congress $380 million were ap-
propriated to States to upgrade their
election security. Also, election infra-
structure was designated as critical in-
frastructure in response to the U.S. In-
telligence Community’s reports that
the Russian Government attacked.
b 0930
This allowed the Department of
Homeland Security to begin providing
additional cybersecurity assistance to
State and local election officials.
Work has been done to help States
improve their election security, and
more work must be done. This is why
our committee Republicans, all of us
on the House Administration Com-
mittee, introduced H.R. 3412, the Elec-
tion Security Assistance Act, to assist
States in their election security
strengthening efforts.
This realistic legislation provides
$380 million in Federal grants to States
to update their aging and at-risk elec-
tion infrastructure, while also requir-
ing State and local officials to have
some skin in the game. We require a 25
percent match to ensure that they un-
derstand they are getting the best
equipment that is going to protect
their voters’ rights to have their votes
counted and protected.
In addition, our bill is the only bill
that creates the first ever Election
Cyber Assistance Unit, aimed at con-
necting our State and local election of-
ficials with leading election adminis-
tration and cybersecurity experts from
across the country.
Our bill also empowers State officials
by providing security clearances to our
election officials to better facilitate
the sharing of information and requir-
ing the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity to notify State election officials of
cyberattacks and any foreign threats
within the State.
It is common sense that if there is an
attempt to hack a State election, the
State election official should be noti-
fied, but they are currently not able to
let a State know if it has been at-
tacked. If DHS is the one that sees this
attack from a foreign country, they
can’t notify State election officials be-
cause, in many cases, they don’t have
security clearance.
Our bill clears this up. Those State
officials deserve the right to know who
is trying to attack their elections in
each State in this great Nation.
My good friend, Congresswoman
TORRES, stated at the Rules Committee
hearing on Monday night that she
doesn’t trust her State election offi-
cials in California to have security
clearances. Personally, I don’t feel that
way, and I think other Members of
Congress may agree with me.
State officials should know if there is
a threat to their election system, and
DHS should be the one telling them.
To sum up the Election Security As-
sistance Act, our solution provides
much-needed election security im-
provements and reinforcements for
local election officials, without over-
stepping the States’ authority to deter-
mine and maintain their own elections.
Unfortunately, I can’t say the same
for the bill we are voting on today.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from California (Mrs. DAVIS), a member
of the House Administration Com-
mittee.
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise in support of the SAFE
Act.
No matter what my colleagues con-
clude about the Mueller report, I think
we can all agree it shows our elections
are under foreign attack.
What would happen if a foreign gov-
ernment actually succeeded in chang-
ing the results of a Federal election?
All bad actors have to do is break
through the defenses of even one—even
one—of the over 10,000 election admin-
istration jurisdictions in our country.
As we all know, questionable results
in just one county can derail an entire
Presidential election and throw our
country into a tailspin.
Election security is national secu-
rity. Election machinery is the ma-
chinery of democracy.
The SAFE Act gives States what
they need to upgrade and maintain safe
and resilient election infrastructure.
In the House Administration Com-
mittee, we debated whether paper bal-
lots are the safest way to go. It does
seem ironic that our answer to cyberse-
curity, in fact, is old school, but we
know what works.
As Oregon’s Secretary of State Den-
nis Richardson said, ‘‘You can’t hack
paper.’’ We can recount and audit paper
ballots with a certainty that we just
don’t have with machines.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.

the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.
BAIRD).
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Illinois for yield-
ing me time.
Madam Speaker, keeping our elec-
tions safe from cyberattacks and fraud
is not and should not be a partisan pri-
ority.
H.R. 2722 has been rushed to the
House floor without giving the Science,
Space, and Technology Committee the
opportunity to hold even a single hear-
ing on the bill or the subject matter.
The problem with rushing this bill
through Congress is that it will have a
significant negative impact on NIST’s
ability to work with State and local
governments to identify standards and
best practices for election security.
Our priority in Congress should be to
develop useful tools that empower
States and local officials to ensure
their elections are secure, accessible,
and accurate.
In fact, our secretary of state in Indi-
ana, Ms. Connie Lawson, has done a re-
markable job leading the effort to add
safeguards to our elections process, en-
suring it is completed with integrity.
Given the opportunity, I believe that
our committee could come to an agree-
ment, in a bipartisan manner, to up-
date NIST’s election and security ac-
tivities.
Congress should focus on legislation
that provides much-needed improve-
ments and reinforcements for local of-
ficials without overstepping the States’
authority to maintain their elections.
Madam Speaker, because of the lack
of following regular order, the com-
mittee has never been given the oppor-
tunity to ensure those issues are ad-
dressed.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. RASKIN), a member of
the House Administration Committee.
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise
in support of the SAFE Act because
Vladimir Putin conducted a sweeping
and systematic campaign to disrupt
and destabilize our Presidential elec-
tion in 2016.
Some say we can’t pass the SAFE
Act to guarantee the security of our
elections, that because of federalism,
we should let the States work it out on
their own.
But we are not the fragmented, di-
vided States of America. We are the
United States of America, and that is
the way we were designed.
Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitu-
tion, Madam Speaker, says Congress
‘‘shall guarantee to every State in this
union a republican form of govern-
ment, and shall protect each of them
against invasion.’’
What does it mean by ‘‘republican
form of government’’? It doesn’t mean
a Republican Party form of govern-
ment. It means a representative form
of government. That means we must
have a system that accurately trans-
lates the popular will into the election
of a Congress.
This is a massive technical challenge
in a country of hundreds of millions of
people, 50 States, and thousands of ju-
risdictions, especially in the computer
age. We need voter-certified, paper-bal-
lot voting systems in every State in
the Union. We need risk-reducing au-
dits. We need real accountability for
election vendors. We need voting ma-
chines manufactured in the United
States, where our democracy is cre-
ated, too.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Speaker, I certainly hope my
good friend from Maryland (Mr.
RASKIN) changes his mind and wants
more Republican governments, but I
don’t think that is going to happen,
even today, on the House floor.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentleman from Florida (Mr.
YOHO).
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I thank
my friend from Illinois for yielding.
I rise today as a Member from the
great State of Florida. We all recall
the 2000 Presidential election. What
happened in Palm Beach County turned
into a national punch line, ‘‘the hang-
ing chad.’’
The Democratic bill before us today
would mandate paper ballots and make
our elections a technology-free zone. I,
too, am worried about malign actors
like Russia and China when it comes to
our cybersecurity network. However,
let us not throw out the baby with the
bath water.
Many of my colleagues submitted
commonsense amendments that would
improve the bill, amendments address-
ing ballot harvesting and ensuring
State matching funds. Yet, Democrats,
under another closed rule, are forcing
passage on a one-sided bill with no
prospect in the Senate and no chance
of being signed by the President.
Madam Speaker, I sincerely hope we
address these issues in a bipartisan
manner that reflects well on this body
and the American people.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
am pleased to yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs.
MCBATH), a new Member of Congress.
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I
rise in support of H.R. 2722. Our elec-
tions are the foundation of our democ-
racy, but they face increasing threats.
There is bipartisan agreement that
we must do more to guard against
these threats to our most fundamental
democratic process. Our elections must
allow us to truly hear the voices of
every American voter.
My home State of Georgia has re-
cently taken steps to safeguard its vot-
ing processes from cybersecurity
threats, and this bill would provide
necessary funding to support these ef-
forts in Georgia and across our coun-
try.
This legislation will strengthen the
partnership of the Election Assistance
Commission, the Department of Home-
land Security, and our State election
officials.
Together, we must modernize our
election infrastructure and ensure the
security of our democracy.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this critical meas-
ure.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from Florida (Mr.
WALTZ), another good friend of mine
from the great State of Florida.
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, elec-
tion security is especially significant
to Floridians. Two Florida counties
were breached in the 2016 election as a
result of Russian spear phishing tar-
geting county election officials.
As Members of Congress, obviously,
we are not here to relitigate 2016 but to
work toward bipartisan solutions to de-
fend the 2020 elections from foreign in-
trusion.
I am disappointed that the majority
is rushing this partisan proposal to the
floor this week and has bypassed Re-
publicans who have shown interest in
working on election security. Just yes-
terday, the Science, Space, and Tech-
nology Committee held a hearing on
election vulnerabilities and potential
solutions. That hearing occurred
after—after—this proposal had been in-
troduced and a day before it will re-
ceive a vote on the House floor.
This proposal throws $1.3 billion at
the problem without careful consider-
ation by the authorizing committees.
This proposal also excludes bipartisan
solutions, like the one I am drafting
with Representative STEPHANIE MUR-
PHY from Florida.
Our proposal, the ALERTS Act,
would require Federal agencies to re-
port to the Department of Homeland
Security if an election intrusion is
identified and require DHS to notify
State and local officials of the breach,
unless the information is deemed to
compromise intelligence sources.
Federal, State, and local officials
have a duty to notify voters in Florida
and voters across the country impacted
by election attacks, a duty that was
not upheld by the FBI in the wake of
the 2016 elections and a duty that the
ALERTS Act, this bipartisan proposal,
would require.
At yesterday’s Science, Space, and
Technology Committee hearing, the
secretary of Oklahoma’s State Election
Board recommended a State and local
reporting requirement like the
ALERTS Act.
So, testimony and a recommenda-
tion—both—were not considered by the
authors of this bill.
Madam Speaker, I request that my
colleagues oppose this bill, and imme-
diately following this vote, I ask
Democrats and Republicans to come
together to work toward a bipartisan
election security package.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
am pleased to yield 1 minute to the

Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Madam

June 27, 2019
State Board of Elections. They
accessed the personal information of
millions of voters and stole thousands
of voter records before being detected.
As far as we know, this breach has
not affected the results of any subse-
quent elections, but it desperately un-
derscores the need for much greater
election security moving forward.
Now, officials in my home State and
others around the country have worked
tirelessly to secure these vulnerabili-
ties over the past 3 years, but without
the help of the Federal Government,
they can only do so much. It is past
time that we step up and give States
the resources they need to ensure our
elections and our voters are safe in the
upcoming election.
Our democratic system depends on
the consent of the governed. That is far
too fragile to take lightly. And our
constituents’ trust and the independ-
ence of our democracy depend on it.
Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I
urge my colleagues to vote for the
SAFE Act on the floor today.
b 0945
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Speaker, look, I respect and
agree with my good friend from Illinois
(Mr. CASTEN), my colleague. We want
to protect our home State. We saw in-
trusion into our Illinois State Board of
Elections voter registration system. It
is something that had to be addressed.
I am happy to report, after talking
with the State Board of Election offi-
cials, they have been given resources
already appropriated by a Republican
majority Congress, Republicans in the
Senate, and President Trump last year
to effectively ensure that that informa-
tion is not vulnerable again.
What we are debating here today is a
bill that will put more unfunded and
underfunded mandates on States like
Illinois. That is not what our local
election officials in my district asked
for.
The reason Illinois was able to pro-
tect itself and ensure that it didn’t
happen again in the extremely high,
historic turnout of the 2018 midterm
election was because they were given
the flexibility to spend the HAVA
funds that Republicans in Congress en-
sured that the State of Illinois had,
leading to a Democratic majority in
the midterm elections.
No one is questioning the safety and
security of our midterm elections. No
one has told me that any foreign entity
hacked into any institution, voter reg-
istration system, or machines. Maybe
DHS hasn’t called me, even though I
think I have a security clearance, so
they could.
But they can’t call our local election
officials, under this bill, if it happens
again because they don’t have security
clearance. That is why our bill is a bet-
ter choice.
The one that is on the floor today
does not address the concerns of States
like mine, and it certainly does not ad-
dress the concerns of States like Cali-
fornia.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from California (Mr.
CALVERT).
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, as a
Member from California, it is hard for
me to believe that the majority could
possibly propose an election security
bill that doesn’t address the major vul-
nerabilities related to ballot har-
vesting.
Ballot harvesting is where paid cam-
paign operatives collect up to hundreds
or even thousands of ballots and drop
them off at polling places or an elec-
tion office. The practice is ripe for
fraud and a recipe for disaster. Any se-
rious effort to secure elections would
address it.
Let’s be clear: We want to give people
who need it an opportunity to vote by
mail, and we want to look for ways to
make it easier for disabled or elderly
Americans to participate in our elec-
tions. My concern is inserting cam-
paign operatives into the ballot-han-
dling process without any safeguards.
In California, paid campaign staff
can collect hundreds of ballots without
having to disclose who they are work-
ing for. When they hand over those bal-
lots to election officials, there is no re-
quirement to even provide their name.
Some of my friends across the aisle
claim that the real problem is bad ac-
tors committing fraud. But it is the
very practice of ballot harvesting being
the problem. The reality is this process
is an open invitation for fraud. That is
why most States have banned the prac-
tice.
Ignoring the most notable threat to
election security is unacceptable in a
so-called election security bill.
Madam Speaker, American voters de-
serve better. I urge my colleagues to
oppose this bill until we can get serious
about real threats to our democracy.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Virginia (Ms. WEXTON).
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, in
2016, Russian hackers tried to break
into Virginia’s election system. In re-
sponse to this information, Virginia
took active steps to secure the integ-
rity of our elections. We sped up our
transition to paper ballots to ensure
that our elections were secure and the
results could be verified and audited.
But it is not just about any one elec-
tion or just about any one adversary.
Passing the SAFE Act is about secur-
ing our elections from all threats, for-
eign or otherwise. These threats are
coming for us in every State, red or
blue, rural or urban.
In 2016, State election websites in Il-
linois and Arizona were hacked by in-
truders that installed malware and
downloaded sensitive voter informa-
tion.
In 2018, electronic voting machines in
Georgia and Texas deleted votes for
certain candidates or switched votes
from one candidate to another.
In Johnson County, Indiana, e-poll
books failed in 2018, halting voting en-
tirely for 4 hours, with no extension of
polling hours.
It is clear that Congress must take
action. Passage of the SAFE Act will
secure our elections by updating our
election infrastructure, speeding up the
transition to paper ballots, and making
necessary investments in cybersecu-
rity.
Every Member of Congress took an
oath to protect this Nation from
threats foreign and domestic, and I
urge my colleagues to honor that oath.
Let’s protect our democracy while we
still have one.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.
LOUDERMILK), my fellow House Admin-
istration Committee Republican and
one of my good friends here in Con-
gress.
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker,
I thank my good friend from Illinois,
an exceptional baseball player, as well,
for yielding this time.
Look, this is something I am very
passionate about, and I am a bit sur-
prised that one of my colleagues from
Georgia would speak against this bill
or even support this bill.
Let’s be frank. Yes, the Russians are
bad. They are very bad. They seek to
do harm to America, and they have
been attempting to influence our elec-
tions for many years.
Yes, we need to be concerned about
election security. But if you want to
secure our election system, this is the
exact opposite of what we should be
doing.
The State of Georgia has recognized
this. Just this year, our State legisla-
ture overwhelmingly passed a bill to
spend $150 million to upgrade our elec-
tronic voting machines so that they
will produce a verifiable ballot that
represents the way the person voted at
the machine.
This is the direction we should be
going, not to eliminate electronic bal-
lots, not eliminate the efficiency that
you get when you can walk in.
The verifiable aspect of it, a voter is
given a card, after it is verified who the
voter is. When a voter walks into a vot-
ing precinct, they fill out the paper-
work and show their ID, and they are
given a card that identifies that they
have been certified. They insert that
card and vote electronically, and then
it will produce a printed receipt that
they can verify that this is the way
they voted. That receipt goes into a
box that is used for a recount. That is
a secure voting system that also em-
braces technology.
This bill would take us back decades.
It is like when a student takes an SAT
exam. They fill out the little bubbles,
and then it runs through an electronic
counter.
Look, even in our own hearing, the
chief technologist at the Center for De-
mocracy and Technology agreed when I
brought this scenario forward, that we
use the technology of DREs that then
will print a verifiable ballot or a re-
ceipt. He said that those were abso-
lutely safe.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5218 June 27, 2019
Now, here is the problem. When we
go to paper ballots, and everyone is
going to fill out these paper ballots, we
are talking long lines. We are talking
about fewer people being able to get to
the polls.
Madam Speaker, when we decide to
vote on this bill, the last thing you are
going to say from that rostrum is
Members will cast their votes via elec-
tronic device. Why? It is efficient. We
have a verifiable way of making sure
that we can see the way we voted on
this board up here or on a printed piece
of paper we can get in the back. This is
because of efficiency.
Madam Speaker, can you imagine if
we had to do paper ballots or voice vote
every one of the many amendments we
have on these appropriations bills? We
would never go home. We would be here
24 hours a day.
The American people expect us to
live by the same laws that they have to
live by. We should embrace technology
and make it secure, not revert back
decades to old technology.
Look, the reality is, this bill would
subject us to the problem of people
walking up with boxes full of
preprinted ballots, all across the Na-
tion, and they could drop those in at
the last minute. We need to verify that
people voting are who they are.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), my col-
league from the House Judiciary Com-
mittee and Homeland Security Com-
mittee.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I thank the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia for her leadership.
There is not a time that I go home
that they don’t ask me how we will se-
cure our elections. I am proudly sup-
porting the Securing America’s Fed-
eral Elections Act, the SAFE Act, and
I am asking why our colleagues are
fighting against Americans having the
right to vote.
The SAFE Act authorizes a $600 mil-
lion Election Assistance Commission
grant program. It provides States with
$175 million in biannual sustainment
funding to help maintain election in-
frastructure.
Voting machines are required to be
manufactured in the United States.
States are mandated to conduct risk-
limiting audits.
Another very important feature of
the SAFE Act is that it requires ac-
countability for election technology
vendors and sets cybersecurity stand-
ards.
As a member of the Subcommittee on
Cybersecurity, recognizing what hap-
pened in 2016, I want to make sure that
the Russian adversaries, the Russian
military, are not our poll watchers, are
not our secretaries of states, are not
the vendors for our machines.
I want to make sure for minorities,
every vote counts, and for every Amer-
ican, every vote counts.
I want to end voter suppression. The
way we do this is to have safe elec-
tions.
I am very proud of this legislation,
and I am proud of this Speaker, proud
of the leadership, to say that we are
going to be first on the line to tell
America we believe in safe, equal, and
fair elections.
I ask my friends to support this legis-
lation.
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the
Committees on the Judiciary and Homeland
Security, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2722,
the ‘‘Securing America’s Federal Elections
Act’’ or SAFE Act.
I strongly support this legislation because
the linchpin of representative democracy is
public confidence in the political system, re-
gime, and community.
That confidence in turn rests upon the ex-
tent to which the public has faith that the sys-
tem employed to select its leaders accurately
reflects its preferences.
At bottom, this means that all citizens cast-
ing a vote have a fundamental right and rea-
sonable expectation that their votes count and
are counted.
This concern is particularly salient because
of the unprecedented interference by a hostile
foreign power to secure victory for its pre-
ferred candidate in the 2016 presidential elec-
tion and the determination of that hostile
power to repeat its success in future American
elections.
That is why it is necessary to pass H.R.
2722, the SAFE Act, so comprehensive elec-
tion security reform measures can be imple-
mented.
Specifically, the SAFE Act authorizes a
$600 million Election Assistance Commission
(EAC) grant program to assist in securing
election infrastructure and a $5 million grant
program to study and report on accessible
paper ballot voting systems.
The bill provides grants to State and local
election officials to replace aging voting ma-
chines with voter-verified paper ballot voting
systems and grants to support hiring IT staff,
cybersecurity training, security and risk vulner-
ability assessments, and other activities to se-
cure election infrastructure.
The bill also provides states with $175 mil-
lion in biannual sustainment funding to help
maintain election infrastructure and, to ensure
States can maintain security gains, provides
each State with no less than $1 per voter who
participated in the most recent election to
maintain election security.
Under the legislation, voting machines are
required to be manufactured in the United
States and states are mandated to conduct
risk-limiting audits, a critical tool to ensuring
the integrity of elections.
These audits, which involve hand counting a
certain number of ballots and using statistical
methods to determine the accuracy of the
original vote tally, are effective at detecting
any incorrect election outcomes, whether
caused by a cyberattack or something more
mundane like a programming error.
The SAFE Act also directs the National
Science Foundation to administer a $5 million
grant program to study and report on acces-
sible paper ballot verification mechanisms, in-
cluding for individuals with disabilities, voters
with difficulties in literacy, and voters whose
primary language is not English.
Madam Speaker, another salutary feature of
the SAFE Act is that it requires accountability
for election technology vendors and sets cy-
bersecurity standards and prohibits wireless
and internet connectivity on systems that
count ballots or upon which voters mark their
ballots or systems are configured.
The SAFE Act also limits state expenditures
on goods and services with grant monies pro-
vided under this Act to purchases from ‘‘quali-
fied election infrastructure vendors.’’
The EAC, in coordination with DHS, estab-
lishes the criteria for achieving the status of
‘‘qualified election infrastructure vendor,’’
which includes maintaining IT infrastructure in
a manner consistent with the best practices
provided by the EAC and agreeing to report
any known or suspected security incidents in-
volving election infrastructure.
Madam Speaker, there is compelling reason
for the Congress to pass the SAFE Act by
overwhelming margins in the House and Sen-
ate because to date the President and his Ad-
ministration has shown little interest or inclina-
tion in taking effective action to deter and pre-
vent interference by foreign powers in Amer-
ican elections.
Let us remember that the Intelligence Com-
munity Assessment (‘‘ICA’’) of January 2017
assessed that Russian President Vladimir
Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016
aimed at the U.S. presidential election in
which Russia’s goals were to undermine pub-
lic faith in the U.S. democratic process, deni-
grate Democratic presidential candidate and
implacable foe of Vladimir Putin, former Sec-
retary of State Hillary Clinton, facilitate the
election of Vladimir Putin’s preferred can-
didate, Donald J. Trump.
Russia’s interference in the election proc-
esses of democratic countries is not new but
a continuation of the ‘‘Translator Project,’’ an
ongoing information warfare effort launched by
Vladimir Putin in 2014 to use social media to
manipulate public opinion and voters in west-
ern democracies.
Instead of supporting the unanimous as-
sessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community,
the President attacked and sought to discredit
and undermine the agencies and officials re-
sponsible for detecting and assessing Russian
interference in the 2016 presidential election
as well as those responsible for investigating
and bringing to justice the conspirators who
committed crimes against the United States
our law enforcement.
And to add shame to insult and injury, at a
meeting in Helsinki, Finland, rather than em-
bracing the conclusions of the U.S. Intel-
ligence Community, the President of the
United States sided with Russian President
Vladimir Putin in heaping scorn on the IC’s as-
sessment regarding Russian interference and
called the U.S. Justice Department investiga-
tion into Russia’s interference led by Special
Counsel Robert Mueller ‘‘the greatest political
witch hunt in history.’’
As the Mueller Report concluded, ‘‘The Rus-
sian government interfered in the 2016 presi-
dential election in sweeping and systematic
fashion.’’
In his only public remarks made since he
was appointed Special Counsel, Robert
Mueller reiterated at his farewell press con-
ference held at the Department of Justice on
May 29, 2017, the ‘‘central allegation of our in-
dictments—that there were multiple, system-
atic efforts to interfere in our election’’ and that
‘‘allegation deserves the attention of every
American.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5219
June 27, 2019
Madam Speaker, American elections are to
be decided by American voters free from for-
eign interference or sabotage, and that is why
I support and urge all my colleague to vote to
pass H.R. 2722, the ‘‘Securing America’s Fed-
eral Elections Act’’ or SAFE Act.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.
PALMER), our Republican Policy Com-
mittee chair.
Mr. PALMER. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Illinois, who
is also a good friend, for the work he is
doing on this, trying to bring some
transparency to what is really going on
here.
There are numerous reasons that
mandating paper ballots isn’t work-
able. They are susceptible to fraud;
they are inefficient; and they are anti-
quated. I have seen, over the years,
where the joke was ‘‘one man, one
vote,’’ where it was ‘‘one suitcase, one
vote,’’ with people bringing in paper
ballots. We have seen a situation
around the country now where that is
still a bit of a problem.
For argument’s sake, though, let’s
just say that paper ballots were fool-
proof and didn’t come with their own
set of problems or security concerns. I
would still be concerned about the im-
pact this bill would have on the major-
ity of our States.
The mandate, in and of itself, is trou-
bling. Twenty-nine out of our 50
States, plus the District of Columbia,
would have to completely revamp their
current election systems. This is both
costly and time-intensive. There is
nearly zero chance this can be adopted
by the 2020 elections. The funding in
the bill makes it clear that they realize
this is not enough money to pay for
this and, if it is not, it would be on a
pro rata share. That means it is an un-
funded mandate in violation of the Un-
funded Mandate Reform Act.
It is easy for Federal lawmakers here
in D.C. to gloss over the impact this
Federal mandate would have, but the
numbers don’t lie. Only 18 States cur-
rently use a paper-only voting system,
as the bill would mandate. Not to men-
tion, this bill would also impact those
18 States, including my home State of
Alabama.
Just a few days ago, the House Com-
mittee on Science, Space, and Tech-
nology held a hearing on ‘‘Election Se-
curity: Voting Technology
Vulnerabilities,’’ where Oklahoma’s
Secretary of the State Election Board
Ziriax pointed out that this bill would
require the use of recycled paper,
which would be impossible to use with
Oklahoma’s current paper ballot sys-
tem because the fibers found in recy-
cled paper would cause repeated false
readings.
While this may seem like a small or
silly detail, this is just one example of
the great impact this bill will have on
all States, with many considerations
that have yet to be vetted properly.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. I
yield the gentleman from Alabama an
additional 30 seconds.
Mr. PALMER. My colleagues on the
other side continue to offer radical and
unworkable policies to revamp our
election system. Security risks do exist
within our ballot boxes, but this bill is
not the answer. This bill will just add
to the existing risks, and I cannot sup-
port it.
I urge my colleagues to oppose the
bill.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, may
I inquire how much time remains on
each side.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California has 14 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from
Illinois has 121⁄2 minutes remaining.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. SARBANES).
b 1000
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
I very strongly support the SAFE
Act. This is something that the Demo-
crats have been focused on from day
one. Day one meaning, the day after
the 2016 election, when we saw the at-
tacks that had come in against our de-
mocracy, we realized we were very ex-
posed, and we needed to take action.
This is our chance to stand up
against interference from foreign ad-
versaries who are trying to hack in,
sow discord, undermine our elections,
and create havoc here in our own coun-
try. This is fundamental to protecting
our democracy.
So we were on the case from the be-
ginning. We convened the Election Se-
curity Task Force, which was led by
ZOE LOFGREN, Bob Brady, BENNIE
THOMPSON and others. They looked at
all of the best practices that we need to
put in place to make sure that our
elections are strong and sturdy, and
how do we fortify them, and they pro-
duced those recommendations.
We then took those recommendations
and we put them into H.R. 1, the For
the People Act, and we passed those on
March 8 of this year, because we knew
that this was a priority and that there
is no time to waste.
Now, our Republican colleagues, un-
fortunately, did not want to go along
with those broad, sweeping reforms
that were contained in H.R. 1, includ-
ing election security measures. So we
made it easy for them, we said, ‘‘Okay.
We will start to break those things out.
We will take the election security
piece and we will bring it as a separate
bill to the floor of the House.’’ That is
the SAFE Act. But we still, appar-
ently, don’t have their support.
This is their opportunity, this is
their chance to stand up and show their
patriotism, to defend our democracy,
to protect our Constitution, to make
sure that our elections are going to be
safe.
So let’s talk about what is in the
SAFE Act, the Safeguarding America’s
Federal Elections Act.
We have significant resources that
are going to be brought to bear to build
up, to fortify the election security in-
frastructure of our country. This is
what the public wants to see. They
want to be ready for the 2020 election.
We have risk-limiting audits to make
sure that States across the country are
figuring out what is going on. Where do
we make changes? How do we protect
ourselves?
Paper ballots. We have had a lot of
discussion about that today. Paper bal-
lots are incredibly important in terms
of boosting the confidence of the public
that elections will be carried out in a
way that you can verify the tally, peo-
ple have the confidence that when they
go to the ballot box, they put their bal-
lot in there, that that vote will be
counted.
We have no time to waste. We need to
get this done now if we are going to be
ready for the 2020 election.
Bob Mueller came along with his re-
port and he said that the Russian inter-
ference was sweeping and systematic in
2016.
Every leader in our intelligence com-
munity has also echoed the fact that
2016 was a dress rehearsal. They are
coming in 2020.
We need to be ready. We need to pro-
tect our elections. Let’s support the
SAFE Act.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Speaker, I yield myself as
much time as I might consume.
Madam Speaker, I agree with my
good friend from Maryland. We as Re-
publicans and Democrats need to do
the patriotic thing and make sure that
our elections are protected.
And I do agree that the Russians
tried to interfere in our election proc-
ess with misinformation campaigns.
But I also want to ask my colleagues
on the other side of the aisle, if their
concentration on election security hap-
pened the day after the 2016 election,
why in the world didn’t the administra-
tion who was in the White House at the
time when the intelligence analysts
were talking about how other foreign
entities, including Russia, were want-
ing to interfere in our elections, why
didn’t they do something about it?
Why are we here today?
Why didn’t it happen before the 2016
election, when our intelligence ana-
lysts said nefarious activity was mov-
ing against the United States of Amer-
ica?
They did nothing. The Obama admin-
istration did nothing. They let it go.
Now we are here watching the new
Democrat majority that was elected in
2018, after explosive turnout in our
midterm elections, their first bill, H.R.
1, that every member of the Demo-
cratic majority cosponsored and sup-
ported, that is the solution?
The solution is to add millions of
taxpayer dollars and then the first ever
corporate dollars into their own con-
gressional campaign accounts?
No one has ever said that is the solu-
tion to too much money in politics or

to election security. Not one time have
I had a constituent say that to me.
Now, we have got to come together
and do what is right.
We have yet to address any of the
issues that were laid out in the Mueller
report. This bill we are debating today
does not address any of them. This is a
discussion about what happened in 2016
without a discussion of what is needed
in our States and local election au-
thorities.
That is what is wrong with this bill,
too. It is hypocrisy at its greatest.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. PELOSI), the
Speaker of the House.
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding,
the chair of the House Administration
Committee, Congresswoman ZOE LOF-
GREN, of whom we are very proud in
California. I thank her for leading us
on this path of patriotism and respect-
ing the oath of office we take.
Madam Speaker, it is just a joy to be
having this opportunity to speak out
for the sacred oath to vote, the sacred
blessing, the right to vote as we leave
to go on the Fourth of July break.
Madam Speaker, I thank the mem-
bers of the House Administration Com-
mittee: Mr. BUTTERFIELD, whom we
heard from yesterday; Mr. RASKIN; Mr.
AGUILAR; Congresswoman SUSAN DAVIS,
who presented to us earlier; and to all
of you.
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. SAR-
BANES. He has been the face of the fu-
ture. He has been speaking out against
the misrepresentations that have hap-
pened, the propagandizing that has
happened by foreign governments in
our election.
Yes, we won the election. We won the
election because the American people
were sick and tired of what the Repub-
licans were putting forth. We won the
election in the most gerrymandered,
voter suppressed political arena you
could imagine, and yet the American
people came forward.
One the biggest messages we had in
the campaign was H.R. 1, to reduce the
role of dark, special-interest money in
politics, to stop the systemic inten-
tional voter suppression by the Repub-
licans across the country, to stop polit-
ical gerrymandering on all sides.
Let’s do it in a nonpartisan way. Let
the chips fall where they may, and to
do so in a way that we are taking a
piece of it today to talk about pro-
tecting our electoral system.
In a short while, we will take up the
Voting Rights Act that is also part of
H.R. 1.
So this H.R. 1 was very supported by
the Democrats, very publicized to the
American people, and part of our For
the People agenda: lower healthcare
costs by lowering the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs and protecting the pre-
existing conditions benefit; bigger pay-
checks by building the infrastructure
of America in a green way; cleaner gov-
ernment by passing H.R. 1—one of the
component parts of what we are com-
ing together around today.
As we approach the Fourth of July,
we must remember the oath that we
take to support and defend the Con-
stitution and to protect the American
people, which demands that this House
of Representatives take urgent action.
We must legislate, we must inves-
tigate, and we must litigate to protect
our national security, defend our de-
mocracy for the people.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s re-
port revealed an all-out attack on our
elections by the Russians, concluding
that they ‘‘interfered in the 2016 Presi-
dential election in sweeping and sys-
temic fashion.’’
Top intelligence and security offi-
cials have made clear that these at-
tacks continue. They are happening,
and they are happening now.
This spring, FBI Director Chris Wray
warned of a ‘‘365-day-a-year threat’’
from the Russians, explaining that
their attacks in our elections were sim-
ply ‘‘a dress rehearsal for the big show
in 2020.’’
This House has a patriotic duty to
protect our democracy from these at-
tacks. This is a matter of national se-
curity. That is why the Democrats first
act in the majority was to advance, as
I mentioned, H.R. 1, For the People
Act, to secure our elections.
Today we are building on that
progress with the Securing America’s
Federal Elections Act, which takes ur-
gently needed action to further
strengthen America’s defenses.
This bill closes dangerous gaps in our
election systems and brings our secu-
rity into the 21st century.
I know that other Members have spo-
ken about the provisions of the bill,
but I just would really like to know
from my Republican friends what is
wrong with replacing outdated, vulner-
able voting equipment? What is wrong
with requiring paper ballot voting sys-
tems to ensure the integrity of our
elections? What is wrong with enacting
strong cybersecurity requirements for
elections technology vendors and vot-
ing systems?
We must be relentless in the defense
of our democracy, fighting on all fronts
to keep America safe.
There is a reason why the Russians
are interfering in our elections, and
other countries may be too, but we can
document with full confidence from the
intelligence community that the Rus-
sians are. It is because they want to af-
fect the outcome of the elections, so
they can affect the policy.
I think it was really sad, I was sad to
hear, and, hopefully, it will be re-
tracted, that the President gave a
green light to the Russians to do it
again. Really? Really?
This week, we are advancing appro-
priations legislation that provides $600
million for election security grants to
States, and increases funding for the
Election Assistance Commission, which
has been starved for funding for years,
a couple of dollars for every person in
our country to honor the vision of our
Founders of a democracy where every-
one who is eligible to vote can vote and
everyone’s vote is counted as cast.
Next month, we will advance further
legislation to protect our national se-
curity and prevent foreign interference
in our elections.
Madam Speaker, I commend the dis-
tinguished chairman of the Homeland
Security Committee, Mr. BENNIE
THOMPSON, for the great work that he
has been doing with his task force and
his committee and other members who
are working with him as we go forward.
We are pleased that the administra-
tion has agreed to provide an all-Mem-
ber briefing on election security that
will happen in July, so we can get the
facts. We have been trying to get the
facts.
Some people around here may think
that it is okay to just make policy
without the facts. We are evidence-
based, scientifically oriented, truth-
and-knowledge based on how we go for-
ward, and we look forward to that
briefing.
We also look forward to July 17,
when Special Counsel Robert Mueller
will come forward and give testimony.
Our national security is being threat-
ened, and the American people need an-
swers.
This is not to be fearmongering. This
is to be smart and to anticipate a
known challenge that exists and to do
something about it.
We can’t just talk about the Mueller
report and saying what it says about
the Russian interference in our elec-
tions, unless we are ready to do some-
thing about it. Today we are, thanks to
our distinguished chair, Chairwoman
LOFGREN.
There is a need for bipartisan support
for our critical commonsense action to
secure our elections.
Unfortunately, Senator MCCONNELL,
a self-described crepehanger, has vowed
to kill our bills in the Senate, while
the President openly declares that he
sees no problem with foreign inter-
ference in our elections.
The GOP Senate and the White House
are giving foreign countries the green
light to attack our country, but the
House will do our patriotic duty to pro-
tect America.
Madam Speaker, as we approach the
Fourth of July holiday, I urge my col-
leagues to remember the oath we took
and the democracy we defend, and to
join me in a strong bipartisan vote to
defend America’s security.
This isn’t about politics. It is about
patriotism. As our Founders said at the
beginning of the Constitution in its
preamble, we do this for the people.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such
time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I agree with my dis-
tinguished colleague from California
that we do need to have the ability for

and our intelligence officials to notify
our State and local election officials if
they see nefarious activity, but right
now under the bill we are debating
today, that would not be the case, be-
cause in many cases, DHS won’t talk
to local election officials or State elec-
tion officials because they don’t have
security clearances.
Our bill, pushed by the Republicans
on the House Administration Com-
mittee, would allow the communica-
tion to take place.
b 1015
You know, we hear a lot of talk
about patriotism coming up on the
Fourth of July. I believe we are all pa-
triots in this institution, but I believe,
also, we have to govern together.
We were working on a bipartisan so-
lution to election security, and all of
the sudden, we were told no more nego-
tiations. That is not how I thought this
institution worked. I thought we could
work together.
Well, I do want to respond to a couple
of comments that my colleague from
California made. She may have men-
tioned H.R. 1. H.R. 1 was the Demo-
crats’ attempt to address not only too
much money in politics, they said;
they also wanted to address election
security.
Clearly, what H.R. 1 did was do noth-
ing to affect the money that is coming
into politics, and it is not doing enough
to ensure that our elections are not im-
pacted by foreign entities with nefar-
ious intentions.
Our bill today that we hoped could
have been debated but was voted down
on a party-line vote in the House Ad-
ministration Committee earlier this
week, just a few days ago, we hoped we
could have come up with that, that is a
bipartisan solution that would have
worked. What works, our last speaker
said, was this. Clearly, that is not what
works.
What works isn’t voting for a bill
like H.R. 1 that votes to put the first
ever corporate money directly into
every Member of Congress’ campaign
accounts. What works, clearly, is not
taxpayer money to fix that problem
when there are not enough corporate
malfeasance funds. That is not what
the American people wanted.
And what would have worked would
have been the last administration, the
Obama administration, listening to
their intelligence agencies and doing
something about nefarious activities
before the 2016 election, not the day
after, when Democrats decided to take
this issue on.
And then all I ever hear is they are
going to blame MITCH MCCONNELL.
Well, I had no idea, before 2016, that
the Obama administration ceded Presi-
dential authority to the Senate major-
ity leader. I had no idea that happened.
Everything is MITCH MCCONNELL’s
fault, right? He is the one who told the
intelligence agencies to stand down.
Are you kidding me?
And now we hear we should have
done something. You are darn right we
should have done something. You are
darn right the Obama administration
should have done something. You are
darn right they should have done it
when they first heard about it before
the 2016 election, and now here we are
to fix it.
And today’s bill is clearly not a fix.
We have got some issues, and it is
really interesting to see my colleagues
from California come up and not want
to address a practice like ballot har-
vesting that is illegal in the State of
North Carolina, where a Republican
who did it is likely to go to jail for it,
but the same process is legal in the
State of California—disastrous.
You want to talk about trying to de-
termine the outcome of elections? We
have put forth amendment after
amendment to address ballot har-
vesting, with complete party-line votes
against making sure the process that is
illegal in North Carolina that a Repub-
lican operative will likely go to jail for
is completely legal in States like Cali-
fornia.
And you want to talk about deter-
mining the outcome of an election?
Come on.
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman
from Georgia (Mr. LOUDERMILK), my
good friend.
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker,
I thank my friend from Illinois for
yielding this minute to me.
The distinguished Speaker talked
about misinformation, and I agree.
There is a lot of misinformation out
there about elections and election se-
curity and a lot of that that goes on
around here. Let’s be factual here.
There has been zero solid evidence of
voter suppression during the last elec-
tion, which had the largest turnout in
the history of this Nation. Our own
committee held seven field hearings
across the Nation, with zero solid evi-
dence of voter suppression, but the
only acts of voter suppression that
they tried to bring up had to deal with
purging voter rolls.
We actually had one hearing in
Broward County. What is Broward
County known for? Voter irregular-
ities. Why? Many times, why? Because
of paper ballots.
But yet this is the direction we are
going in, and the distinguished Speaker
said we are taking it into the 21st cen-
tury. Show me how. How is this taking
us into the 21st century? It is taking us
back decades.
Look, if the Russians were actually
physically invading our Nation with
bombers and tanks, this bill would be
the equivalent of giving our military
pellet guns and paper airplanes to
thwart the attack. This is taking us
away from election security.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD), a
valued member of the House Adminis-
tration Committee.
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the chair of our committee
for yielding me time this morning.
Madam Speaker, I rise this morning
in strong support of H.R. 2722. It is past
time that this Congress act boldly in
response to the foreign interference
that took place in our 2016 elections,
and that is exactly what this bill does.
The gentleman from Ohio, the rank-
ing member of the committee, I say to
him it is disingenuous to point the fin-
ger at the Obama administration. That
may or may not be accurate, but let us
look forward.
This legislation provides $600 million
in grants to State and local officials to
secure election infrastructure and re-
place aging voting machines with
voter-verified paper ballot voting sys-
tems; $175 million to States every 2
years to maintain elections infrastruc-
ture. It requires States to implement
risk-limiting audits; it prohibits inter-
net accessibility or connectivity for de-
vices on which ballots are marked or
tabulated; and it sets long-needed cy-
bersecurity standards for vendors.
I ask my colleagues, let us look for-
ward. Let us protect the right to vote.
Let us protect the ballot of every
American citizen.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such
time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I really respect my
colleague from North Carolina, and I
do want to correct him a little bit.
I am from Illinois, not Ohio. I would
never mistake the gentleman from
North Carolina as being from some-
place like South Carolina. But the gen-
tleman from North Carolina is a good
friend.
Look, we all have disagreements on
this House floor, but that doesn’t mean
we are disagreeable when it comes to
having good friendships, and I thank
him for his courtesies and thank him
for his friendship.
The State of North Carolina is a
great example of why we need to do
better, why we ought to go back to the
drawing board.
Let’s take this bill off the floor. Let’s
get back to bipartisan negotiations, be-
cause in States like North Carolina and
States like Illinois where local election
officials have bought machines, they
bought machines, maybe they have
current optical scan machines, but the
requirement in this bill, as the Okla-
homa secretary of state said, the re-
quirement of this bill to have recycled
paper through ballots, many of the al-
ready purchased optical scan machines
that would be required for every local
and State election official to purchase
after the year 2022 may not be able to
read the ballots on recycled paper. So
you are going to have to reinvest hard-
earned tax dollars where many local
communities in our great States have
already invested in updating their elec-
tion security with the most secure
election equipment that they felt was
going to protect them.
Washington should not be telling our
local officials what to buy, especially
when there are provisions in this bill
that make equipment that would fit

those guidelines illegal to use or are
inoperable even if they have purchased
it. We have got to do better.
We all want to protect this great Na-
tion. We all want free and fair elections
so that every vote is counted and pro-
tected. Let’s do it together. Let’s do it
right.
Let’s make sure we address some
DHS concerns. Let’s put a cybersecu-
rity assistance unit together like we
have tried to do.
Let’s outlaw ballot harvesting, be-
cause I know we have got bipartisan
support in working together on that
issue, especially with my good friend
from North Carolina, Mr. BUTTERFIELD.
I look forward to working with him on
this. I know he and I both have con-
cerns about this process, and I thank
him for his willingness to sit down and
talk.
We can do better. The bill on the
floor today is not better. Let’s do it.
Let’s work together. Pull this bill off
the floor. We have got a lot of other
issues to debate today.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, we
have no additional speakers, so if the
gentleman would like to yield back, I
will close.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Speaker, how much time do I
have left?
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
JACKSON LEE). The gentleman from Il-
linois has 23⁄4 minutes remaining. The
gentlewoman from California has 9
minutes remaining.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Speaker, I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time.
Madam Speaker, well, clearly the
timekeeper is wrong. I obviously
thought I had more, but I am not able
to debate that today. I will go ahead
and close.
I do want to thank my colleague
from California and also the members
of the House Administration Com-
mittee, where we have an opportunity
to come together, but this bill is just
simply another partisan bill by the ma-
jority aimed at federally mandating
election standards, like mandating
that States exclusively use paper bal-
lots, effectively banning any type of
digital recording device that would
have even a verified paper backup.
The committee even had one hearing
on this issue with Commissioners from
the EAC—remember, that agency that
one speaker earlier said was getting a
pittance of dollars, small amounts of
dollars over the last few years. Only in
this institution is $380 million given by
the Republican majority here in the
House in the last Congress and signed
into law by the President of the United
States, only in this institution is $380
million a little bit. A lot of that money
still hasn’t even been spent by our
local election officials.
So here we are today debating a bill
that is going to basically commit 1.3
billion taxpayer dollars toward so-
called election security. We still have
not addressed the problem that if DHS,
if our same intelligence officials who
told the Obama administration that
there was foreign interference in our
2016 elections and the Obama adminis-
tration did nothing about it—because,
why? Because of MITCH MCCONNELL. It
is MITCH MCCONNELL’s fault.
Seriously, come on. Get real here. We
are legislators. We are an equal branch
of government. There is absolutely no
way any administration cedes author-
ity to anybody in this legislative insti-
tution.
The Obama administration failed to
address the problem of election inter-
ference in 2016, and here we are today
trying to make sure that we fix it. This
attempt to fix it is a partisan attempt
at ensuring that our elections authori-
ties and our States and our local elec-
tion officials have a top-down, feder-
ally mandated approach that is going
to potentially cost them millions of
taxpayer dollars that they have al-
ready inserted into their own budgets
over the last few years.
Our local officials have told us they
want flexibility. Cybersecurity con-
cerns are where they have invested
much of the $380 million that we put
forth in the last Congress.
Let’s make sure we spend the money
that we have already appropriated;
let’s make sure we take a common-
sense approach; and let’s give our elec-
tion officials, Republicans and Demo-
crats from throughout this great Na-
tion, the ability to address the con-
cerns they know are weakest in their
own system. Let’s not have some bu-
reaucrat out here in a concrete build-
ing determining what is going to work
best in the State of Texas, in the State
of Illinois, in the State of California, or
anywhere else.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I think it is important to address a
few of the issues that have been raised
in the course of this debate.
First, we are moving forward with
the SAFE Act because of a sense of ur-
gency that we have about the 2020 elec-
tion. That sense of urgency was fueled
by the Director of National Intel-
ligence, and it was fueled by the Direc-
tor of the FBI who told us that red
lights, warning lights were flashing
and that the 2016 election was just a
prelude to what the Russians were
going to do in the 2020 election. We feel
a sense of urgency.
As has been mentioned by others,
H.R. 1 included provisions about ballot
security. But I introduced this bill, the
SAFE Act, on May 14 because it was
specifically addressing election secu-
rity, and, also, we made some addi-
tional enhancements to H.R. 1 relative
to cybersecurity and the like.
b 1030
We drafted the bill with the assist-
ance of the Parliamentarian so that it
was entirely within the jurisdiction of
the House Administration Committee,
with one exception. There was a line on
page 11 of the committee mark that au-
thorized a study by the NSF. The
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee waived jurisdiction on markup
because it was just a study, and that
was very clear.
This bill has proceeded in the regular
order. It has been noticed according to
our rules. And it brings us here today
to test whether we are going to meet
the challenge that faces us in ballot se-
curity: whether we are going to allow
the Russians to attack our country by
trying to steal our election next year
or not.
Mention has been made about the
need for bipartisanship. I work often on
a bipartisan basis with Members of the
other party. I will say that we have
tried in vain to have the Republican
Members buy into the need to require
best practices for next year’s election,
and we couldn’t reach agreement.
We decided that it is our responsi-
bility to move forward, and that is why
we are here today.
Just a mention on unfunded man-
dates, we are authorizing about $1 bil-
lion. $380 million was appropriated last
year, and as the Speaker mentioned,
we are appropriating this year an addi-
tional $600 million for ballot security.
This bill authorizes the $600 million
that we are appropriating, and we
think it is important that that money
flow to the States to harden our sys-
tems so the election cannot be stolen
by our enemies. It is ironic that some
on the other side of the aisle have com-
plained about unfunded mandates at
the same time they tried to impose a 25
percent match requirement on States
for receiving these funds that they
need to get to harden our system.
Just a comment on DREs, DREs are
not as unsafe as pure electronic voting,
but they are not best practices.
Much has been mentioned about the
State of Georgia. It is worth noting
that the Georgia legislature ignored
the advice they got from computer sci-
entists that what they were doing did
not meet best practices for ballot secu-
rity.
A study published by Georgia Tech
indicated that most voters did not ac-
tually look at the receipt when it was
printed. They also point out that even
though printed ballots, when voters do
look at them, include the names of
candidates, votes will be encoded in
barcodes that humans can’t authen-
ticate and that are subject to hacking.
‘‘There’s nothing speculative about
these vulnerabilities,’’ said a Georgia
Tech computer professor and former
chief technology officer for Hewlett-
Packard. ‘‘If exploited, it would affect
the result of the election. It’s not a se-
cure system.’’
We need to fix these things not be-
cause it is partisan but because we
need to protect America.
The idea that we would allow this
just to be decided at a local level is

wrongheaded. If the Russians launched
missiles at the counties of the United
States, we wouldn’t say, well, that is
just a local issue. We would say, no,
that is an attack on the United States
of America.
We need to harden our systems and
protect our country.
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge the
adoption of this measure.
I would like to read from a letter
that we received just yesterday from
the NETWORK Lobby for Catholic So-
cial Justice. In their last paragraph,
the Catholics say:
In a secular democracy, elections are the
closest thing we have to a sacrament. We
know that nefarious foreign and domestic ac-
tors continue to meddle in our democratic
systems, and we have been put on notice that
previous efforts were only trial runs, pre-
sumably for our next election in 2020. The
NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice
considers our elections to be sacrosanct and
that Congress must pass the SAFE Act to
protect them.
This bill is supported by a broad sec-
tor of civil rights groups, including the
NAACP and Common Cause. It deserves
all of our support.
I urge my colleagues to support H.R.
2722 to ensure the security of our Na-
tion’s election infrastructure.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time
for debate has expired.
Pursuant to House Resolution 460,

ant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further

OF THE SENATE AMENDMENT TO

MENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR

AND SECURITY AT THE SOUTH-
ERN BORDER ACT, 2019
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, by
direction of the Committee on Rules, I
call up House Resolution 466 and ask
for its immediate consideration.
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 466
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to take from the
Speaker’s table the bill (H.R. 3401) making
emergency supplemental appropriations for
the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and
for other purposes, with the Senate amend-
ment thereto, and to consider in the House,
without intervention of any point of order, a
motion offered by the chair of the Com-
mittee on Appropriations or her designee
that the House concur in the Senate amend-
ment with an amendment consisting of the
text of Rules Committee Print 116–21. The
Senate amendment and the motion shall be
considered as read. The motion shall be de-
batable for one hour equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minority
member of the Committee on Appropria-
tions. The previous question shall be consid-
ered as ordered on the motion to its adoption
without intervening motion.
POINT OF ORDER
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, pursuant
to section 426 of the Congressional
Budget and Impoundment Control Act
of 1974, I make a point of order against
consideration of the rule, House Reso-
lution 466.
Section 426 of the Budget Act specifi-
cally states that the Rules Committee
may not waive the point of order pre-
scribed in section 425 of that same act.
House Resolution 466 makes in order
a motion ‘‘without intervention of any
point of order.’’ Therefore, I make a
point of order, pursuant to section 426
of the Congressional Budget Act, that
this rule may not be considered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oklahoma makes a point
of order that the resolution violates
section 426(a) of the Congressional
Budget Act of 1974.
The gentleman has met the threshold
burden under the rule and the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma and a Member
opposed each will control 10 minutes of
debate on the question of consider-
ation. Following debate, the Chair will
put the question of consideration as
the statutory means of disposing of the
point of order.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Oklahoma.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, the bill before us
today provides no CBO cost estimate,
so we literally have no idea as to
whether or not there are additional un-
funded mandates being imposed on the
States. We do know that the States are
already having to use their scarce re-
sources to deal with this border crisis,
and the legislation before us today does
nothing to alleviate that.
Indeed, my colleague from Texas (Mr.
BURGESS) made that very point and of-
fered an amendment, which was re-
jected by the committee, to consider
reimbursing the State of Texas over
$800 million for their expenses. Those
same kinds of expenses—probably not
to that magnitude—have been under-
taken by other States. Madam Speak-
er, we don’t think that we should pro-
ceed until we have that information
and the House has a chance to consider
that.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
claim time in opposition to the point of
order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized for 10 minutes.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, what we are trying
to do here is bring a bill to the floor to
help alleviate the suffering of children
who, in my opinion, have been abused
under U.S. custody at our border. Ev-
erybody has read the news articles and
everybody has seen the pictures. We
have a moral obligation to move for-
ward. To try to delay consideration of
a bill to help these children I think is
a mistake.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, actually, on that,
we have a great deal in common with
one another. We, too, think we ought
to address this matter quickly.
As I am sure my friend recalls, we
have tried on 16 different occasions
over the last 8 weeks to bring legisla-
tion that would alleviate this problem
to the floor. Our friends rejected that
every single time.
We also have a bill that has been
passed by the Senate 84–7: a bill where
35 Democrats—about three-quarters of
the number of Democrats—supported, a
bill that we know would solve, a bill
that if we would bring to this floor we
can pass immediately and it would go
to the President’s desk; it wouldn’t
have to go back to the Senate. So my
friends, by not accepting an over-
whelmingly bipartisan bill by the Sen-
ate and simply moving it on, are the
ones who are actually imposing a delay
here.
What they have got in front of us
that we will consider later today, if
they are successful, frankly, is some-
thing we know the Senate is unlikely
to accept. I have not heard from the
President, but given the scope of the
changes inside the bill, these are all
changes that, in some cases, failed yes-
terday in the Senate—reductions in
spending for the military and for the
Border Patrol—that the administration
has already signaled they will reject.
There is a simple solution here. We
could simply take the Senate bill up
that has passed 84–7—overwhelming
support on both sides of the aisle—get
that bill down to the President, and
the money could start flowing imme-
diately. If we proceed as my friends
want to proceed, we are simply going
to be playing ping-pong back and forth.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I am surprised that
my colleagues on the Republican side
hold this institution in such low es-
teem. We are the House of Representa-
tives. Our voice matters.
On this issue, the House voted first
on a measure to try to help provide
some assistance to these children at
the border. Then the Senate passed a
different version. The way it is sup-
posed to work is we have a negotiation
and we try to come to agreement and
come up with a compromise bill. So the
idea that somehow we don’t matter in
the House, that we shouldn’t matter in
the House, that we should just accept
whatever the Senate does, to me, I find

that disrespectful of the House of Rep-
resentatives.
What we are doing is we are sending
the Senate basically all that they
want, plus we are adding things to help
protect children and to provide for
more transparency. We are strength-
ening requirements for children’s
health. We are tightening restrictions
for children’s safety. We are supporting
nonprofits in communities caring for
children’s well-being. I mean, we are
embracing compassionate processing
for children’s comfort. Again, we are
enhancing accountability in trans-
parency and mandating fiscal responsi-
bility.
Who can possibly be opposed to those
things? That is what we are trying to
do. We are trying to insist that the
House’s voice matters, and we are try-
ing to make the Senate bill even bet-
ter.
Again, what motivates us here is the
well-being of these children. We are
here because we are for the children.
We are here because we are outraged at
the way they have been mistreated by
this administration. We are tired of ex-
cuses as to why we can’t protect the
children. We are moving forward with
legislation that will protect the chil-
dren against any abuse at our border.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
b 1045
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I don’t doubt my
friend’s sincerity and compassion and
concern for these young people for one
minute. I know him well as a person
and value him as a friend. Although, I
must say, this would have been much
nicer 8 weeks ago when the administra-
tion first asked for it.
While my friend lays out some of the
changes in the House bill, he neglected
to mention that the House bill cuts the
administration’s request for reimburse-
ment to the military by $124 million. It
cuts the administration’s request for
money to the Border Patrol, which is
probably where the most difficult part
is, by, I think, $89 million. So we have
substantive disagreements.
Again, we have a bill that has passed
overwhelmingly. Many of the items my
friends want to add have already been
considered by the Senate and rejected
by the Senate. So it seems to me, when
we have a bipartisan product that has
got substantial support on both sides
and that the White House has signaled
it would accept, that is the way we
should go.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.
WOMACK), my good friend and the rank-
ing Republican member of the Com-
mittee on the Budget.
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I
thank my friend from Oklahoma for
leading in this discussion.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
the question on consideration. We
should be taking up the Senate-passed
bill. It has already been mentioned
that it passed 84–8.
We don’t have a CBO score for the
changes made by the House amend-
ments to the bill, and without a CBO
score, we don’t know the cost this bill
would have on State and local govern-
ments.
Yesterday, in a budget hearing on
matters of immigration, we heard tes-
timony from the mayor of Yuma, Ari-
zona, which clearly demonstrates the
economic impacts and costs that
States and local governments are in-
curring due to the crisis at the border.
My friends just said changes made by
the House on this Senate-passed bill
take tens of millions of dollars away
from the Department of Defense for re-
imbursement and limit the ability of
Customs and Border Patrol to ade-
quately pay for the services incurred as
a result of this ongoing crisis.
Madam Speaker, Democrats have had
many opportunities to advance bipar-
tisan solutions that would provide the
kind of relief to these communities and
begin to address the crisis at the bor-
der, and for nearly 2 months, they have
refused to act.
This week has been an unfortunate
loss of precious time. This is a situa-
tion where Congress clearly needs to
come together and act swiftly. I am
sorry to say, we are falling short in
this basic obligation of the duties of
the Congress of the United States of
America.
Madam Speaker, again, I rise in sup-
port of the question that we have under
consideration.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
am a little confused. My Republican
friends say they want to delay things
to have a CBO score, then they say
they want to get something to the
President’s desk right away. They can
talk all they want about a CBO score;
we are going to talk about the chil-
dren.
It is an emergency, and what is hap-
pening to these children on the border
is unconscionable. It should weigh
heavily on the hearts of every single
person in this Chamber—Democrats
and Republicans, alike.
Enough is enough. We need to make
sure that we not only provide the nec-
essary resources to alleviate this crisis,
but we need to make sure that those
resources we provide are provided in
such a way that they do go to the pur-
poses that we want them to go to.
And as far as the Department of De-
fense money, I mean, the bottom line is
this administration has been diverting
funds from the Department of Defense
for this stupid wall, and they have cre-
ated that crisis.
The bottom line is we are here for
the children, and, again, I urge my col-
leagues to stop the bickering and get
down to business. Let us pass this rule;
let us go on to pass the legislation; and
let us get a deal with the Senate that
is better than what is on the table
right now.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. WOODALL), my very good
friend and distinguished member of the
Rules Committee.
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I
think folks are going to have a tough
time containing their emotions today.
We met in the House Rules Committee
at 8 a.m. this morning, and folks al-
ready had fuses that were running
short.
I agree with my friend from Massa-
chusetts, enough is enough.
We had an amendment offered in the
Rules Committee this morning. I don’t
think most folks in this body know be-
cause folks weren’t at the Rules Com-
mittee this morning. We had an amend-
ment offered in the Rules Committee
this morning that said, if the gen-
tleman wants to do this new bill that
has been crafted by the Democratic
majority, bring that new bill to the
floor, but let’s at least consider the bi-
partisan bill that passed the Senate,
resoundingly, 84–8 yesterday.
I agree with my friend from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN), enough is
enough, Madam Speaker. We could
send a bill to the White House today to
start the money going today.
My friend from Massachusetts said:
Let the Republicans talk if they want
to. We want to talk about the children.
I am tired of talking about the chil-
dren. Let’s serve the children. Let’s do
it. Let’s do it. Let’s stop talking about
it.
It has been almost 60 days that we
have been talking about it, with one
tragic picture after another rolling
across the national headlines. Let’s
stop talking about it.
If folks have an alternative view,
they can share alternative view as they
have, but allow us to vote on what the
Senate agreed, 84–8, after roundly re-
jecting the previously passed House
language, was an opportunity to serve
the children today.
Madam Speaker, I don’t believe the
Members of this institution know what
happened in the Rules Committee this
morning. I don’t believe the Members
of this institution know we rejected
that bipartisan opportunity this morn-
ing. With this, under a point of order,
we will bring the Members of this insti-
tution down here to the House floor
where they will hear it themselves.
We have an opportunity to act now,
as my friend from Oklahoma (Mr.
COLE) has offered. The question is: Are
we going to take ‘‘yes’’ for an answer
or are we just going to continue to talk
about the children?
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
am really puzzled here. Why is it that
the Senate can say no, but the House
can’t say no to something? Why is it
that we always have to do what the
Senate wants?
If the gentleman is so enamored with
the Senate, maybe he should work over
in the Senate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5225
June 27, 2019
But the bottom line is, those of us in
the House deserve to have our voices
heard, and what we are saying here is
that we want to provide a bill that will
alleviate this crisis, that will help the
children.
Mr. WOODALL. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. MCGOVERN. I will not yield. I do
not have enough time to yield.
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, the
gentleman has mischaracterized my
statement.
Will the gentleman yield?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts has the
time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
would like us to make sure we provide
resources to the border that actually
alleviate the crisis.
I do not want to be part of an effort
to send money to the border to be di-
verted for whatever this President
wants. He has shown us where he is on
this issue of the children and on the
issue of immigration. And, quite frank-
ly, many of us on this side of the
aisle—and, I think, some on the other
side of the aisle—are offended by that.
So we want to make sure, when we
say we are providing relief to this cri-
sis that is affecting so many children,
that, in fact, we are providing relief to
those children. And that is all we are
saying here.
Madam Speaker, strengthening re-
quirements for children’s health, why
would anybody in the Senate want to
be opposed to that?
Tightening restrictions for children’s
safety, people are dying in our custody.
We should want to prevent that from
ever occurring again by supporting
nonprofits and community caring for
children’s well-being.
Madam Speaker, this stuff is some-
thing that should not be controversial
no matter how you look at it, and yet
it is for my Republican friends, and I
regret that very much.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I am puz-
zled as well. I am puzzled why this
wasn’t dealt with 8 weeks ago when the
administration asked. I am puzzled
why, for 16 times when we tried to
bring this matter up on the floor, our
friends in the majority rejected that.
Now we are in a hurry. Well, if we are
in a hurry, the way to act is to take
the vehicle that has actually passed
the United States Senate in an over-
whelmingly bipartisan fashion and
send it to the President of the United
States.
That is not what my friends want to
do. They want to prolong the debate.
They have prolonged it for 2 months,
for 8 weeks, by not taking the matter
up. They are prolonging it today by not
taking what has already been passed
and moving along.
So, obviously, we oppose this rule,
and we want to move on. We will be
happy to work with them to move on
the Senate legislation. I think it would
pass in an overwhelmingly bipartisan
way; the President would sign it; and
that aid would begin flowing. What my
friends are proposing is quite the oppo-
site. It is a prolonged back-and-forth
with the United States Senate.
I have deep respect for the institu-
tion, but what is going to come out of
here is going to be partisan; what came
out of there is bipartisan.
What is going to come out of here
won’t be signed by the President; what
has come out of the United States Sen-
ate will be. So if they are in a hurry to
get the money moving, that is the way
we should proceed.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, let
me remind my colleagues, this is not
the House bill that passed. This is a
compromise that we have moved for-
ward.
And, again, here is what my friends
are saying is partisan: that we put into
this bill that for children’s health we
must ensure a higher standard for med-
ical care, nutrition, and hygiene. That
is what they are calling partisan. That
is what they are saying, oh, it is awful,
we can’t move forward on that.
The bill we are putting forward, this
compromise bill, will meet the needs of
the children. That is all that it does.
So I don’t know why we in the House
can’t, in a bipartisan way, stand to-
gether and say: Look, we want to im-
prove on what the Senate did, and we
want to guarantee that the moneys we
send actually go to help the children
and not get diverted to other things
like we know this administration has a
habit of doing.
Madam Speaker, anybody who has
seen the pictures in the newspapers re-
cently, anybody who has read the news
articles, again, our hearts should ache.
This is not America. This is not what
our country is about. We can do much,
much better, and that is why we should
move forward with consideration.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, may I in-
quire as to how much time is remain-
ing?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oklahoma has 11⁄2 minutes
remaining. The gentleman from Massa-
chusetts has 31⁄4 minutes remaining.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close and will yield back the
balance of my time at the conclusion of
my remarks.
Madam Speaker, we don’t think the
House bill is a better bill. We don’t
think reducing the amount the Senate
gave to the military by $124 million is
a good idea. We don’t think reducing
the amount of money that is going to
Border Patrol, which is one of the
areas that is a problem, by $89 million
is a good idea. We don’t think a lot of
this effort to micromanage a crisis
that is thousands of miles away from
us by this body here has good sugges-
tions.
We want some flexibility. We think
the Senate bill does take care of the
needs on the border in terms of unac-
companied minors who have crossed
over into our territory. So we just
don’t think this does it, and we think
this prolongs the process.
We have a bipartisan bill—a perfect
bill? No. Is our bill a perfect bill? No.
As a matter of fact, we like the Senate
bill on our side better than this bill.
Regardless, that one can pass. That one
can pass on this floor. That one can be
signed into law.
This one that my friends are embark-
ing on, they think it is an improve-
ment. I will just tell them, politically,
not passing the Senate, not likely to be
signed by the President.
So if we want to get help there imme-
diately, we have a way to do it in the
Senate bill. We think this leads us to a
political dead-end.
Madam Speaker, I would press for my
motion, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, my colleagues have
seen the pictures and they have heard
the stories. And if that is not con-
vincing to them to move forward, to in-
crease protections for children who are
held in our custody, then I don’t know
what else to say.
What we are asking for here in this
compromise bill that we are moving
forward is to make sure that there are
stronger protections in here, to make
sure that the abuse that we have all
read about and that we have all seen
stops and never, ever happens again.
That is what this is all about.
So I am at a loss because, to me, the
evidence is overwhelming that we need
to provide stronger protections for
these children. If my colleagues dis-
agree, then they can vote against the
bill and against consideration, but I
would urge all of my colleagues to vote
‘‘yes’’ so that we can move forward
with this rule in consideration of this
bill and get this passed as soon as pos-
sible and get on to either urging the
Senate to pass it or to continue in ne-
gotiation, but we can do better than
the Senate bill.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is, Will the House now con-
sider the resolution?
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, on that I
demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 226, nays
188, not voting 18, as follows:

Messrs. BIGGS, YOUNG, and
TIMMONS changed their vote from
‘‘yea’’ to ‘‘nay.’’
So the question of consideration was
decided in the affirmative.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
CUELLAR). The gentleman from Massa-
chusetts is recognized for 1 hour.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, for
the purpose of debate only, I yield the
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), the
ranking member of the Rules Com-
mittee, pending which I yield myself
such time as I may consume. During
consideration of this resolution, all
time yielded is for the purpose of de-
bate only.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts?
There was no objection.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, today
the Rules Committee met and reported
a rule, House Resolution 466, providing
for consideration of the Senate amend-
ment to H.R. 3401. One hour of general
debate has been provided, controlled by
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Appropria-
tions.
Mr. Speaker, I think, by now, we all
have seen the horrific images showing
the bodies of Oscar Alberto Martinez
Ramirez and his nearly 2-year-old
daughter, Valeria. They were taken on
Monday as these Salvadoran migrants
tried to cross the Rio Grande after
leaving a Mexican migrant camp. Like
so many others, they were exercising
their legal right to seek asylum here in
the United States. They wanted to be
free from the violence, gangs, poverty,
and inequality that is rampant in El
Salvador, just as it is all across Central
America.
I visited El Salvador and I visited
Honduras recently, and, Mr. Speaker, I
saw the unbearable conditions with my
own eyes. It is no wonder that organi-
zations like the United Nations Office
on Drugs and Crime have said this and
other Central American countries are
more dangerous than Afghanistan and
only slightly better than Syria.
Syria, Mr. Speaker, is the site of an
ongoing civil war. Let that sink in for
a moment.
But, unfortunately, Alberto and
Valeria didn’t survive their journey.
Alberto’s wife, Tania, was forced to
watch in horror as a current washed
her family away.
I am telling their story today be-
cause this is what migrants face as
they risk their lives to come to this
country—not to transport drugs, not to
commit crimes, as the President sug-
gests, but to find refuge, to raise their
daughter in a safe place, and to have a
chance at building a better life, a life
that they could only find in America.
Isn’t this what each of us wants for
our own families?
They came to present themselves at
a legal port of entry and to seek legal
asylum, as is their right under U.S.
law.
And they weren’t the only ones to
die. Just this past weekend, Border Pa-
trol agents found four more bodies in
the river west of Brownsville, Texas:
three more young children and a young
woman in her twenties.
Every single week, people drown in
the river and perish in the deserts, in-
visible and unknown.
It wasn’t too long ago that we cele-
brated how immigration made our
country stronger, whether it was a
Democratic or a Republican adminis-
tration.
I am reminded of President Reagan’s
final speech in office, where he said:
Anybody, from any corner of the world,
can come to America to live and become an
American. This, I believe, is one of the most
important sources of America’s greatness.
But, Mr. Speaker, the Trump admin-
istration apparently has the complete
opposite view of immigration. They
don’t celebrate it; they demonize it.
Consider what may have happened to
Oscar and his family if they did make
it to our border, forced to sleep on con-
crete floors with the lights on 24 hours
a day, with no soap, no medicine,
maybe not even a toothbrush, Valeria
separated from her parents, because
that is what migrants are forced to en-
dure at border facilities under this
President.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5227
June 27, 2019
A physician who visited one recently
said: ‘‘The conditions within which
they are held could be compared to tor-
ture facilities.’’
Mr. Speaker, when Lady Liberty en-
courages us to give her our poor,
huddled masses, I don’t think she
means so the administration can turn
around and throw them in a cage. I
don’t think she lifts her torch so their
legal plight could be criminalized and
crying children could be ripped from
the arms of their parents.
But that is what is happening under
this President, and, Mr. Speaker, it is
sickening. It should tear at the hearts
of every single Member of this House,
whether they are Democrats or Repub-
licans.
This week, the House passed bipar-
tisan emergency legislation to address
this humanitarian crisis at the border.
The Senate had its own ideas. So,
today, we are back with a compromise
to get a bill quickly signed into law.
This is a compromise that lives up to
our core values and protects children
and families. It adds critical protec-
tions for children who were included in
the House version of the bill. It in-
cludes language to improve care for
children by forcing influx facilities to
comply with the Flores settlement and
capping, at 90 days, the amount of time
a child can spend in such a facility.
We are also reducing funding for ICE,
while rejecting additional and unneces-
sary dollars for the Pentagon.
This is a crisis, Mr. Speaker. We can-
not treat compromise as though it is a
dirty word, not when migrants are lit-
erally losing their lives in unsafe,
unhealthy, and unsanitary conditions
and children are being torn apart from
their families. That is what is at stake
here.
The horrors at detention centers
shouldn’t get lost in the latest tweet-a-
thon by the President, just as the
plight of migrants shouldn’t go unseen
by the American people. This should
shake our conscience and make clear
the urgent need to act.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this rule and the underlying
bill, and let’s send a message to the
President and to the world that Amer-
ica is better than this. This is not who
we are, what is happening at our bor-
der.
Mr. Speaker, I would just say one
final thing. In the compromise package
today that seems to bother so many
people are merely items that would
protect the well-being of these chil-
dren, that would provide more trans-
parency. For the life of me, I don’t un-
derstand the controversy. I don’t un-
derstand why we can’t make the Sen-
ate bill better, why we can’t do more
for these children.
I know my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle feel as we do, that
what is happening is unacceptable. Let
us strengthen that bill. Let us actually
give a bill to the President that we all
know will help these children.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
I want to begin by thanking my good
friend, the gentleman from Massachu-
setts (Chairman MCGOVERN) for yield-
ing me the customary 30 minutes.
Mr. Speaker, well, we are here for the
third time this week and the second
time on a supplemental appropriations
bill for the southern border.
Earlier this week, I spoke on this
floor and expressed my concerns about
the House bill. Make no mistake, we
need emergency funding for the crisis
on the southern border. We needed it 2
months ago, and we need it even more
desperately today.
Two days ago, I warned that the bill
the House was considering would not
pass the Senate and would not become
law, and I was proven correct. The
House bill failed in the Senate. In fact,
it only received 37 votes in support. In
contrast, the Senate amendment
passed in a bipartisan vote of 84–8.
If the Democratic leadership would
allow a vote on the Senate text, I be-
lieve it would pass this Chamber today
and be on its way to the President’s
desk—today. But, instead, we are here
considering a rule that would further
amend the bill, bringing back in provi-
sions that have already failed to garner
support in the Senate.
If this bill fails to pass the Senate, as
I expect will happen, then we will be
leaving town for a week without actu-
ally having passed anything to deal
with the crisis. And I do remind my
friends on the other side we have at-
tempted on our side, 16 times, to bring
up legislation to deal with this, and the
President asked for this money 2
months ago.
So, I am glad they have a sense of ur-
gency now, because we have not seen it
in the past.
My sense is that this is more about
maintaining the unity of the Demo-
cratic Caucus than it is about pressing
legislation that can be enacted into
law. But that has been true for this en-
tire Congress, and it is why my friends
have, so far, failed to enact any signifi-
cant legislation during their tenure in
the majority.
Mr. Speaker, we are out of time. We
desperately need to get these emer-
gency funds to the Federal agencies re-
sponsible for managing this crisis.
They are out of money and need addi-
tional resources to take care of people,
many of them innocent children, who
are affected by this crisis. We do not
have the luxury of time in responding
to this emergency.
My friends on the other side of the
aisle are about to make the exact same
mistake that they made on Tuesday
when they pushed forward a partisan
bill that would not pass the Senate and
that the President would not sign into
law.
What I don’t understand, Mr. Speak-
er, is why the majority is so resistant
to acting in a bipartisan manner here.
Both Republicans and Democrats agree
that we need additional funding to ad-
dress the crisis on the southern border.
There is a real chance to send a bipar-
tisan bill to the President that will be-
come law. And, instead of doing what
will immediately help children and
families at the border, the majority is
attempting to cut the needed funding
from the Senate bill, add partisan rid-
ers back into it, and then send it back
to the Senate, where it can fail again.
Madam Speaker, we do not have time
to waste on purely political exercises.
There is still an opportunity to correct
that mistake, Madam Speaker, and I
would urge the majority to take that
opportunity seriously.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentleman from California (Mr.
MCCARTHY), the distinguished Repub-
lican leader.
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, 58 days—58 days—is
the amount of time since the adminis-
tration asked and said there was a cri-
sis on the border, that they needed
funding.
Madam Speaker, 18 times—18 times—
we had the opportunity to take a vote
on this floor, and we did not come to a
solution, and it did not pass.
Madam Speaker, two times—two
times—The New York Times wrote edi-
torials in those 58 days calling upon
this body to put politics aside, that
this crisis on the border was greater
than the politics that we want to play.
The Mexican Government realizes
there is a crisis on the border and just
sent 15,000 troops. We have seen the
pictures. We have heard the words. On
either side they talk of it.
We were in this well just a few days
ago having a debate. Many of us said:
Why would we take this moment to do
a political maneuver that will not go
anywhere in the Senate?
Don’t take our word for it. Take the
votes for it. The bill did not pass.
There is a time for every season. The
season to continue to play politics is
over. The season to put people before
politics is now.
Don’t take my word for it. Take the
example of the Chamber that is just
across the way. It is not far. You can
see it if you look out those doors; you
can walk it without taking much
breath; and you can understand what
bipartisanship looks like, Madam
Speaker.
The Senate took up a bill to take up
this crisis. The vote was 84–8.
b 1145
Madam Speaker, 84–8. There has been
historic legislation that was passed
with much less, but there have been
very few that have ever been defeated
that have gone 84–8.
But today, we are going to take
hours to learn the exact same experi-
ence that we had just a few, short
hours ago. The 84–8—when I listen to
the other side and say that this—the
Democratic Party, Madam Speaker,
wants to do this.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5228 June 27, 2019
Let me read the names of some of
those who voted for this bill to under-
stand what bipartisan sounds like: Sen-
ator CHUCK SCHUMER, Senator DICK
DURBIN, Senator TIM KAINE, Senator
PATTY MURRAY, and Senator DIANE
FEINSTEIN all voted ‘‘yes.’’ Every single
member of the Senate Democratic
leadership voted ‘‘yes’’ to end the crisis
on the border.
But why, Madam Speaker, are we on
this floor now? Why does the Demo-
cratic leadership on this side want to
continue to play politics when the
Democrat leadership in the Senate says
no?
Fifty-eight days is enough. Eighteen
votes over there are too many.
But, yes, people are dying. But, yes,
the money is out. We have all acknowl-
edged it on this floor.
Madam Speaker, it makes me begin
to wonder, how can a few control so
many?
On that opening day, when we are on
this floor, we all raise our hand indi-
vidually. We all swear to uphold the
Constitution. Our names are individ-
ually on the ballot when we are voted
to come in here.
This is not a moment to let some-
body else control your name or your
voting card. This is not a moment to
say, my party tells me to go here, be-
cause that is not the case.
CHUCK SCHUMER is the leader of the
Democratic Party. DICK DURBIN is the
leader of the Democrats when it comes
to immigration. I have spent hours and
months with DICK DURBIN in a room
trying to come to an immigration
agreement, and we have seen places
far, far apart. We have spent months
trying to come to a conclusion.
But you know what? We have this
time. We have found a more perfect
union when we found bipartisanship.
But are we going to allow a few to
continue to deny it?
Fifty-eight days. You do not have
more. The money is gone. The time is
now.
We all know that we are better than
this. I do not accuse anybody on either
side of what they truly believe about a
crisis. I have heard.
I have heard people on the other side
of the aisle, Madam Speaker, that said
they want to vote for the Senate bill.
Can we allow them to vote for the Sen-
ate bill?
Can we allow them to join with the 84
Senators out of 100 on the other side
that said ‘‘yes’’ to it? Or do we have a
few that control what can come to the
floor?
Now, I heard in this rule debate that
there are some amendments; that
somehow they are going to make it
better. What makes it better? That we
do not fund to pay any overtime costs
for Immigration and Customs Enforce-
ment officers, or provide funding for
the active duty of the National Guard
troops working with them on the front
line of the crisis at the border?
Is that making it better?
Is that really what you want to stake
your political career on?
Is that really what you want to stand
up against bipartisanship for?
Madam Speaker, I have heard a lot of
names on the other side say they would
vote for it. I think everybody in this
body knows that that Senate bill will
pass. I think everybody in their heart
knows that is where we are going to
end up.
But do we have to go through it one
more time?
You do not have to worry about what
the outcome will be. The leader of the
Senate has already said what will hap-
pen; because I will promise you this, on
this side of the aisle, we will stay here
until this is done. We will not leave,
and we will stand with the bipartisan
vote in the Senate.
If you are worried about getting to
218, do not worry. Put that bill on sus-
pension, I promise you it will pass.
I call upon all of our better angels for
this one moment, for this one time,
when America is watching, that we rise
to the occasion; that we put the par-
tisanship aside; that we have swapped;
that the Senate has actually taught us,
given us the adult supervision to show
that, yes, we have had that fight; yes,
you tried to make it and it didn’t make
it. But there is something better.
There is a window, and there is an op-
portunity.
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous
consent to take from the Speaker’s
table H.R. 3401, with the Senate amend-
ment thereto, and concur in the Senate
amendment.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
JACKSON LEE). The Chair would advise
that all time has been yielded for the
purpose of debate only.
Does the gentleman from Massachu-
setts yield for the purpose of this unan-
imous consent request?
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
do not yield for that purpose. All time
yielded is for the purpose of debate
only.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts does not
yield; therefore, the unanimous con-
sent request cannot be entertained.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I want to assure the distinguished
minority leader that I am not asking
Members of Congress to vote for what
we are bringing before the House today
based on their party. I am asking Mem-
bers to vote their conscience.
And to be totally frank, we want to
make sure there are protections built
in this legislation so that funds are not
misused as they have been in the past;
so we don’t see any more children
being abused; so we don’t see the mis-
management that we have witnessed.
With all due respect to the Senate
majority leader, and to many of my
friends on the other side of the aisle,
when children were being ripped apart
from their parents, we heard silence.
When we read about the terrible condi-
tions that these children were in, being
denied soap, and toothpaste, and tooth-
brushes, and not being cared for, we
heard silence.
When we saw the picture of Oscar and
Valeria dead, trying to seek asylum in
this country, there is nothing.
So the bottom line is, we want to get
this done, and we will stay here as long
as it takes, I assure the minority lead-
er. We are not going anywhere.
But we are going to stand for the
children, and that is what our purpose
is here today.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania
(Ms. SCANLON), a distinguished member
of the Rules Committee.
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I am
so glad that our colleagues across the
aisle agree that the conditions at the
border are intolerable, because they
are.
A few months ago, I had the oppor-
tunity to go to the southern border,
meet with Border Patrol agents and ad-
vocates on the ground, including a
woman who had been separated from
her children, and we toured detention
facilities.
The humanitarian crisis then, in Feb-
ruary, was undeniable, and it has only
gotten worse. But the cause of this cri-
sis has raised serious questions, par-
ticularly as to why it has escalated.
In addition to suspending critical aid
designed to relieve conditions causing
desperate families to flee their homes,
the Trump administration is failing to
use longstanding lawful processes and
available resources to provide relief to
children and refugees at the southern
border.
The Trump administration’s policies
are not making our border safer, but
they are worsening the situation, at
the expense of the health and well-
being of desperate children and fami-
lies.
There are unused beds at facilities in
my home State of Pennsylvania and in
Texas, and many refugee children have
sponsors, family members available
here, but they are being denied access.
Prior to coming to Congress, I rep-
resented immigrants and asylum seek-
ers who, by definition, lawfully enter
this country seeking refuge. I can con-
fidently say that international law is
being violated on a daily basis by this
administration, and it has abandoned
longstanding legal norms for proc-
essing asylees, with the apparent pur-
pose of exacerbating the crisis for po-
litical gain.
I agree that we need to send addi-
tional resources to relieve the inhu-
mane conditions affecting refugees at
our border. But we also have a respon-
sibility to make sure that those re-
sources are not misused to worsen
rather than relieve this crisis.
Therefore, I urge that we support the
border relief bill that is before us,
which will provide resources to relieve
the crisis and improve the health and
well-being of innocent children, while
allowing transparency and oversight.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.

To our Republican colleagues in the

Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
include in the RECORD two articles, one
from The New York Times entitled:
‘‘ ‘There is a Stench’: Soiled Clothes
and No Baths for Migrant Children at a
Texas Center’’; the other, ‘‘ ‘The
Taliban Gave Me Toothpaste’: Former
Captives Contrast U.S. Treatment of
Child Migrants.’’
[From the New York Times, June 21, 2019]
‘THERE IS A STENCH’: SOILED CLOTHES AND NO
BATHS FOR MIGRANT CHIDREN AT A TEXAS
CENTER
(By Caitlin Dickerson)
A chaotic scene of sickness and filth is un-
folding in an overcrowded border station in
Clint, Tex., where hundreds of young people
who have recently crossed the border are
being held, according to lawyers who visited
the facility this week. Some of the children
have been there for nearly a month.
Children as young as 7 and 8, many of them
wearing clothes caked with snot and tears,
are caring for infants they’ve just met, the
lawyers said. Toddlers without diapers are
relieving themselves in their pants. Teenage
mothers are wearing clothes stained with
breast milk.
Most of the young detainees have not been
able to shower or wash their clothes since
they arrived at the facility, those who vis-
ited said. They have no access to tooth-
brushes, toothpaste or soap.
[Hundreds of migrant children have now
been transferred out of the facility.]
‘‘There is a stench,’’ said Elora Mukherjee,
director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at
Columbia Law School, one of the lawyers
who visited the facility. ‘‘The overwhelming
majority of children have not bathed since
they crossed the border.’’
Conditions at Customs and Border Protec-
tion facilities along the border have been an
issue of increasing concern as officials warn
that the recent large influx of migrant fami-
lies has driven many of the facilities well
past their capacities. The border station in
Clint is only one of those with problems.
In May, the inspector general for the De-
partment of Homeland Security warned of
‘‘dangerous overcrowding’’ among adult mi-
grants housed at the border processing cen-
ter in El Paso, with up to 900 migrants being
held at a facility designed for 125. In some
cases, cells designed for 35 people were hold-
ing 155 people.
‘‘Border Patrol agents told us some of the
detainees had been held in standing-room-
only conditions for days or weeks,’’ the in-
spector general’s office said in its report,
which noted that some detainees were ob-
served standing on toilets in the cells ‘‘to
make room and gain breathing space, thus
limiting access to the toilets.’’
Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas on Friday an-
nounced the deployment of 1,000 new Na-
tional Guard troops to the border to help re-
spond to the continuing new arrivals, which
the governor said have amounted to more
than 45,000 people from 52 countries over the
past three weeks.
‘‘The crisis at our southern border is un-
like anything we’ve witnessed before and has
put an enormous strain on the existing re-
sources we have in place,’’ Mr. Abbott said,
adding, ‘‘Congress is a group of reprobates
for not addressing the crisis on our border.’’
The number of border crossings appears to
have slowed in recent weeks, possibly as a
result of a crackdown by the Mexican gov-
ernment under pressure from President
Trump, but the numbers remain high com-
pared to recent years. The overcrowding cri-
sis has been unfolding invisibly, with jour-
nalists and lawyers offered little access to
fenced-off border facilities.
The reports of unsafe and unsanitary con-
ditions at Clint and elsewhere came days
after government lawyers in court argued
that they should not have to provide soap or
toothbrushes to children under the legal set-
tlement that gave Ms. Mukherjee and her
colleagues access to the facility in Clint. The
result of a lawsuit that was first settled in
1997, the settlement set the standards for the
detention, treatment and release of migrant
minors taken into federal immigration cus-
tody.
Ms. Mukherjee is part of a team of lawyers
who has for years under the settlement been
allowed to inspect government facilities
where migrant children are detained. She
and her colleagues traveled to Clint this
week after learning that border officials had
begun detaining minors who had recently
crossed the border there.
She said the conditions in Clint were the
worst she had seen in any facility in her 12–
year career. ‘‘So many children are sick,
they have the flu, and they’re not being
properly treated,’’ she said. The Associated
Press, which first reported on conditions at
the facility earlier this week, found that it
was housing three infants, all with teen
mothers, along with a 1–year-old, two 2–year-
olds and a 3–year-old. It said there were doz-
ens more children under the age of 12.
Ms. Mukherjee said children were being
overseen by guards for Customs and Border
Protection, which declined to comment for
this story. She and her colleagues observed
the guards wearing full uniforms—including
weapons—as well as face masks to protect
themselves from the unsanitary conditions.
Together, the group of six lawyers met
with 60 children in Clint this week who
ranged from 5 months to 17 years old. The in-
fants were either children of minor parents,
who were also detained, or had been sepa-
rated from adult family members with whom
they had crossed the border. The separated
children were now alone, being cared for by
other young detainees.
‘‘The children are locked in their cells and
cages nearly all day long,’’ Ms. Mukherjee
said. ‘‘A few of the kids said they had some
opportunities to go outside and play, but
they said they can’t bring themselves to play
because they are trying to stay alive in
there.’’
When the lawyers arrived, federal officials
said that more than 350 children were de-
tained at the facility. The officials did not
disclose the facility’s capacity but said the
population had exceeded it. By the time the
lawyers left on Wednesday night, border offi-
cials told them that about 200 of the children
had been transferred elsewhere but did not
say where they had been sent.
‘‘That’s what’s keeping me up at night,’’
Ms. Mukherjee said.
Some sick children were being quarantined
in the facility. The lawyers were allowed to
speak to the children by phone, but their re-
quests to meet with them in person and ob-
serve the conditions they were being held in
were denied.
The children told the lawyers they were
given the same meals every day—instant
oats for breakfast, instant noodles for lunch,
a frozen burrito for dinner, along with a few
cookies and juice packets—which many said
was not enough. ‘‘Nearly every child I spoke
with said that they were hungry,’’ Ms.
Mukherjee said.

H5232 June 27, 2019
Another group of lawyers conducting in-
spections under the same federal court set-
tlement said they discovered similar condi-
tions earlier this month at six other facili-
ties in Texas. At the Border Patrol’s Central
Processing Center in McAllen, Tex.—often
known as ‘‘Ursula’’—the lawyers encoun-
tered a 17–year-old mother from Guatemala
who couldn’t stand because of complications
from an emergency C-section, and who was
caring for a sick and dirty premature baby.
‘‘When we encountered the baby and her
mom, the baby was filthy. They wouldn’t
give her any water to wash her. And I took
a Kleenex and I washed around her neck
black dirt,’’ said Hope Frye, who was leading
the group, adding, ‘‘Not a little stuff—dirt.’’
After government lawyers argued in the
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Fran-
cisco this week that amenities such as soap
and toothbrushes should not be mandated
under the legal settlement originally agreed
to between the government and migrant
families in 1997 and amended several times
since then, all three judges voiced dismay.
Among the guidelines set under the legal
settlement are that facilities for children
must be ‘‘safe and sanitary.’’
The Justice Department’s lawyer, Sarah
Fabian, argued that the settlement agree-
ment did not specify the need to supply hygi-
enic items and that, therefore, the govern-
ment did not need to do so.
‘‘Are you arguing seriously that you do not
read the agreement as requiring you to do
anything other than what I just described:
cold all night long, lights on all night long,
sleeping on concrete and you’ve got an alu-
minum foil blanket?’’ Judge William Fletch-
er asked Ms. Fabian. ‘‘I find that inconceiv-
able that the government would say that is
safe and sanitary.’’
‘THE TALIBAN GAVE ME TOOTHPASTE’: FORMER
CAPTIVES CONTRAST U.S. TREATMENT OF
CHILD MIGRANTS
(By Deanna Paul)
[June 25, 2019]
The federal government told a panel of
Ninth Circuit appellate judges last week that
U.S. border detention facilities are ‘‘safe and
sanitary,’’ as required by law, even though
migrant children are denied soap, tooth-
brushes and dark places to sleep.
Judge William A. Fletcher called the posi-
tion of Sarah Fabian, a senior attorney from
the Office of Immigration Litigation, ‘‘in-
conceivable.’’
Senior U.S. Circuit Judge A. Wallace
Tashima told the government attorney, ‘‘If
you don’t have a toothbrush, if you don’t
have soap, if you don’t have a blanket, it’s
not safe and sanitary.’’
Fabian’s argument spread rapidly across
the Internet—and so did several tweets sup-
porting the notion that the United States
treats migrant detainees less humanely than
foreign pirates and the Taliban treat their
captives.
American journalist Michael Scott Moore,
abducted in 2012 while reporting in Somalia,
watched Fabian argue that minimal neces-
sities, like toiletries and sleeping conditions,
were not essential to meet minimum ‘‘safe
and sanitary’’ standards.
‘‘That was—let’s say—below my experience
in Somalia,’’ he told The Washington Post
Tuesday of his more than two years in cap-
tivity.
‘‘The conditions were about as miserable
as you could imagine,’’ he said, describing a
barren and concrete prison house. Often
there was no electricity, he said, ‘‘but we
had certain minimum things that kept it
from being completely wretched.’’
He said he was given toothpaste, soap, a
daily shower and a foam mattress.
Recent reports have surfaced describing
U.S. border detainees held in cages of chain-
link fencing, sleeping on concrete and cov-
ered with blankets made of aluminum foil,
allegations that Customs and Border Protec-
tion officials dispute.
On Tuesday, the agency said that children
in custody receive ‘‘continuous access to hy-
giene products and adequate food’’ while
awaiting shelter placement.
Somali pirates gave me toothpaste & soap.

An executive editor at newyorker.com,
David Rohde, contributed to the online con-
versation, too.
‘‘The Taliban gave me toothpaste & soap,’’
he wrote on Twitter, drawing from the seven
months he spent as a hostage of the Taliban.
Rohde said he was not abused in their cus-
tody, though the group is known for abusing
its captives.
The online thread with former prisoners
has been liked nearly half a million times.
Washington Post Global opinions writer
Jason Rezaian, who was held in Iranian cus-
tody for a year and a half and has an ongoing
lawsuit against the Iranian government, also
responded on Twitter.
‘‘I felt if I didn’t chime in, it would be the
height of hypocrisy,’’ Rezaian told The Post
on Tuesday, calling U.S. treatment of chil-
dren at the border misaligned with ‘‘what
this country stands for.’’ ‘‘The government is
treating them like they’re statistics, ‘the
other’ and not deserving of basic humanity.’’
From the first day in captivity, Rezaian
was permitted to shower regularly. He was
also given a toothbrush and toothpaste.
Rezaian asked, ‘‘If we’re going to treat the
most vulnerable people this way, what does
that say about our actual values?’’
I had a toothbrush and toothpaste—not ex-
actly Aquafresh or Tom’s—from the first
night. Actually, I had almost nothing else in
my cell while I was in solitary confinement.
I was allowed to shower every couple of days.

The case heard on Tuesday stems from a
motion filed under the Obama administra-
tion. In part, it argued that Customs and
Border Protection was holding children in
detention facilities that were not ‘‘safe and
sanitary,’’ in violation of a 1997 precedent.
The Trump administration, however, opted
to bring the appeal, asking the panel of three
judges to condone current custody condi-
tions.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR).
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, the
last thing I would want to see is a re-
peat of the other night when my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle
laughed and jeered as I described the
situation at the border and what is
happening to the children in our cus-
tody.
Madam Speaker, the minority leader
earlier asked why are we here again—
one word, ‘‘oversight’’—‘‘oversight.’’
We have seen, as Members of Con-
gress, too often, our desire to provide
oversight, which is a fundamental re-
sponsibility, a fundamental duty of
ours, we have seen it thwarted and we
have seen it obstructed.
There is no one in this Chamber right
now who feels more of a sense of ur-
gency than the Representative from
Texas 16, El Paso, where we have had a
front row to the atrocities occurring at
the hands of this government.
And I will tell you, part of the chal-
lenge for many of us who have worked
with goodwill and charity has been wit-
nessing the fact that Congress has not
been able to provide fundamental
guardrails for the treatment of these
kids.
What is the main difference between
the Senate bill and the House bill?
Ours is far more humane. Ours ensures
that money will not be diverted for
things that have turned a challenge
into a crisis.
A few examples include ripping chil-
dren from the arms of their parents or
sending vulnerable populations back
into Mexico. In fact, Madam Speaker,
in my district, one of the individuals
sent back to Mexico under this admin-
istration’s policy was kidnapped and
raped. We have also seen people legally
blocked at our ports of entry, sent to
more treacherous crossings. That is
why Oscar and Valeria died.
So oversight is why our bill is the
better bill.

Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker,
point of order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-

Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, has
the gentleman from Massachusetts
yielded the floor by taking his seat?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts has re-
served his time.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield to
the distinguished gentleman from
North Dakota (Mr. ARMSTRONG), my
very good friend, for the purpose of a

Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent to take from
the Speaker’s table H.R. 3401, with the
Senate amendment thereto. And if we
would like to talk about accountability
and if we would like to talk about over-
sight, I would prefer we start right
here. Let your Members vote.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts has not
yielded for that purpose and, therefore,
the unanimous consent request cannot
be entertained.
Time will be deducted from the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I think
you will be delighted to hear that I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
the great State of Michigan (Mr.
MITCHELL).
Mr. MITCHELL. Madam Speaker, it
is nice to know that my colleagues on
the other side of the aisle now recog-
nize it as a crisis.
The President asked 58 days ago for a
supplemental appropriation to deal
with this issue. It was ignored. We have
tried 18 times to bring up a bill on the
floor to deal with supplemental appro-
priations for humanitarian aid at the
border, and it was ignored.
My friends on the other side of the
aisle said they want to improve the
bill. They want to ignore the fact that
the Senate took up the House bill and
overwhelmingly rejected it on a bipar-
tisan basis.
Then they passed a bipartisan bill 84–
8, which doesn’t happen over there very
often. We have gone through a list of
those who voted in favor, including
Senator SCHUMER and Senator DURBIN,
yet somehow the House wants to ig-
nore it. At least the majority in the
House want to ignore it.
How they want to improve the bill,
you may ask? Well, let’s start by sim-
ply reducing or eliminating border se-
curity, that appears to be optional to
my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle. They want to take a hatchet to
ICE. These are law enforcement per-
sonnel.
My son is a police officer. He puts on
a vest every day. If you told me we
were going to withhold payroll or over-
time when they are doing the job, I
would be offended, I would be dis-
gusted, and I am, at this moment in
time.
Let me ask how many over there
would put on a vest, go out and do the
job, and then hear, we may or may not
pay you? Do I see any hands raised? I
doubt it.
Law enforcement is struggling to do
a job, an extraordinarily tough job, and
we want to make it harder. So let me
suggest, as the UC request was made,
that we take up the bill that was
passed by the Senate and we pass it.
And I ask for your attention over
there, sir, unless, of course, you de-
cided that policy is being made by a
fragment of your conference, unless
you decided that you are going to turn
over the gavel to a fragment of your
conference to make decisions for you,
which may well appear to be the case.
But let’s be honest to the American
people and tell them that a fragment, a
small portion, of your conference is
now functioning as a Speaker of the
House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. What we just witnessed was real-
ly interesting. In the amount of time
that it took my friends on the other
side of the aisle to get through those
antics, we could have passed this bill.
That is what urgency looks like. Not
political theater. These kids that we
are here to try to protect deserve more
than grandstanding. They deserve
things like medicine. They deserve
things like soap and clothing.
And my Republican friends say they
don’t want to waste time, but they
wasted a hell of a lot of time with what
we just saw happen.
And just one other observation. In all
the other editorial comments that were
made, I didn’t hear the word ‘‘chil-
dren’’ mentioned once. I mean, it is
telling, because that is what this de-
bate is all about. It is not about
grandstanding, and it is not about
more money for cages to put kids in. It
is about the children. And I am sorry
that the children who are suffering
under U.S. custody are such an after-
thought.
And to the gentleman from Michigan,
I am outraged, too. I am outraged that
the terrible conditions that these kids
have been forced to experience hap-
pened under U.S. custody. I am out-
raged that that would happen in the
United States of America.
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to
the gentlewoman from Connecticut
(Ms. DELAURO), the distinguished
chairwoman of the Appropriations Sub-
committee on Labor, Health and
Human Services, Education, and Re-
lated Agencies.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I
rise in support of this emergency sup-
plemental bill.
Madam Speaker, the principles guid-
ing this bill were clear from the outset.
It is a response to a humanitarian cri-
sis.
By increasing the housing capacity
at Health and Human Services to mov-
ing these vulnerable children from the
detention centers at Customs and Bor-
der Protection as quickly as possible to
Health and Human Services, because
we know what the conditions are at
CBP. They are deplorable. In fact, it is
government-sponsored child abuse.
We wanted to build in the protections
for children that have been nonexistent
in the past, and we uncovered those
abuses. They have been reported in the
press. The Miami Herald just recently
said they are ‘‘prison-like conditions’’
at Homestead.
And we wanted to place children with
a sponsor in a safe placement, a safe
environment, as expeditiously as pos-
sible to reverse the administration’s
policy of frightening sponsors to come
forward.
This bill includes strong protections
and safeguards for these vulnerable
children; it extends to the influx shel-
ters’ enhanced standards of care. And,
my friends, it is for the first time ever.
These protections have never been re-
quired of these influx shelters.
It continues to prevent the waiving
of core standards and protections after
6 months.
It continues to hold influx shelters
accountable by requiring HHS to re-
move an operator if they do not comply
with these core standards.
b 1245
If the shelter is not in compliance,
then HHS is required to award the con-
tract to a new service provider, and the
bill continues to protect sponsors and
potential sponsors by extending a pro-
vision that prohibits funds from being
used to put anyone into a removal pro-
ceeding based on information from
HHS’ sponsor-vetting process.
The bill continues to require HHS to
maintain the directives that they
issued in December that removed bu-
reaucratic barriers and have helped to
place these children with sponsors as
expeditiously as possible. And the bill
continues to require HHS to report to
Congress within 24 hours if an unac-
companied child dies in HHS custody.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut an additional 1 minute.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, a
child did die in HHS custody. No one
knew about this for 8 months, and it
was only the news media that uncov-
ered it. A child died.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5236 June 27, 2019
This bill continues to ensure that
Members of Congress can conduct over-
sight visits of shelters without being
required to provide advance notice, and
the bill continues to protect taxpayer
funding by prohibiting funds from
being diverted to programs outside of
Health and Human Services. This bill
provides clear direction, legal guard-
rails, about how our emergency funds
should be used, and this bill wages the
battle for the vulnerable.
Madam Speaker, I urge every Mem-
ber of this House to support this bill.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to simply concur in
the Senate amendment without further
amendment. This will immediately
send the bill to the President and de-
liver the necessary resources needed to
respond to this humanitarian crisis.
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous
consent to insert the text of my
amendment in the RECORD, along with
extraneous material, immediately
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma?
There was no objection.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, let me
just say again, we can solve this prob-
lem now.
I respect that my friends have strong
feelings about their legislation. We all
do. The reality is that that legislation
is not going to get through the Senate;
it is not going to be signed by the
President.
We have a vehicle that has already
gotten through the Senate, that 75 per-
cent of the Democrats in the Chamber
voted for, including the entire Demo-
cratic leadership, and that could go, if
this House would act on it, straight to
the President’s desk and be signed into
law.
Now, my friends are, I know, con-
cerned about resources. And, again, it
is nice that they are. It would have
been nice if, in the 18 previous times we
have tried to bring this matter up be-
fore the House, they would have
helped. It would have been nice if, 2
months ago, we had actually seen them
respond.
We share their concern for these
young people. That is why we asked for
extra resources. The administration
asked for extra resources 58 days ago.
So I think, again, this ought to be pret-
ty easy to resolve here.
My friends, with all due respect, have
a partisan bill that will pass along par-
tisan lines in this House, that will not
be enacted by the Senate, and that will
not be signed by the President.
The Senate has a bill they have al-
ready passed in a bipartisan fashion. It,
frankly, has more money to help the
people who are being paid overtime in
the Border Patrol to—
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair notes a disturbance in the gal-
lery in contravention of the law and
rules of the House. The Sergeant at
Arms will remove those persons re-
sponsible for the disturbance and re-
store order to the gallery.
The gentleman from Oklahoma may
continue.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I want to
thank the Speaker personally for tak-
ing control of a difficult situation.
So, Madam Speaker, just to resume
my point, we have a vehicle. It could
literally pass on this floor in less than
an hour. It could head to the President.
It satisfies almost all—not all, but al-
most all—of my friends’ concerns. I
would just ask them, in all seriousness,
to just consider political reality here
and let’s get this done and get these re-
sources to where they are needed. We
can do that. We can do it in a bipar-
tisan fashion.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
include in the RECORD two articles: One
from Vox, entitled, ‘‘The Horrifying
Conditions Facing Kids in Border De-
tention, Explained,’’ and another from
Time magazine, entitled, ‘‘Lawyers
Say Migrant Children Are Living in
‘Traumatic and Dangerous’ Conditions
at Border Detention Site.’’
[From Vox, June 25, 2019]
THE HORRIFYING CONDITIONS FACING KIDS IN
BORDER DETENTION, EXPLAINED
(By Dara Lind)
On any given day, 2,000 children are in Bor-
der Patrol custody, and the problems are
hardly confined to one facility.
At any given time, for the past several
weeks, more than 2,000 children have been
held in the custody of US Border Patrol
without their parents. Legally, they’re not
supposed to be held by border agents for
more than 72 hours before being sent to the
Department of Health and Human Services,
which is responsible for finding their nearest
relative in the US to house them while their
immigration cases are adjudicated.
In practice, they’re being held for days,
sometimes weeks, in facilities without
enough food or toothbrushes—going days
without showering, overcrowded and
undercared for.
Late last week, the conditions of that de-
tention in one facility in Clint, Texas, be-
came public when investigators, checking on
the US government’s obligations under the
Flores agreement (which governs the care of
immigrant children in US custody), were so
horrified that they turned into public whis-
tleblowers and spoke to the Associated Press
about what they saw.
The stories they told have horrified much
of America. The past several days have seen
growing outrage, and the acting commis-
sioner of Customs and Border Protection
(which oversees CBP) announced his resigna-
tion Tuesday (though officials maintain the
outrage didn’t cause the resignation).
But the problem goes beyond one official—
or one facility.
The story gained even wider traction after
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (D–NY) ref-
erence to the detention facilities as ‘‘con-
centration camps,’’ and the ensuing debate
over whether that term was appropriate.
The US government’s response was to
move the children out of the Clint facility—
and move another group of children in.
On Monday, officials confirmed that all 350
of the children there last week would be
moved to other facilities by Tuesday; about
250 of them have been placed with HHS, and
the remainder are being sent to other Border
Patrol facilities. But on Tuesday morning, a
Customs and Border Protection official told
a New York Times reporter on a press call
that about a hundred children were cur-
rently being housed at Clint.
That’s illustrative of the hectic improvisa-
tion that’s characterized much of the Trump
administration’s response to the current bor-
der influx. It’s a problem that is much, much
bigger than the problems at a single facility.
Indeed, the problems investigators identified
at Clint are problems elsewhere as well.
The lone member of the team of legal in-
vestigators who visited the El Paso facility
in which many children were sent from
Clint—called ‘‘Border Patrol Station 1’’—
told Vox that conditions there were just as
bad as they were in Clint, with the same
problems of insufficient food, no tooth-
brushes, and aggressive guards.
The problem isn’t the Clint facility. The
problem is the hastily-cobbled-together sys-
tem of facilities Customs and Border Protec-
tion (the agency which runs Border Patrol)
has thrown together in the last several
months, as the unprecedented number of
families and children coming into the US
without papers has overwhelmed a system
designed to swiftly deport single adults.
It is apparent that even an administration
acting with the best interests of children in
mind at every turn would be scrambling
right now. But policymakers are split on
how much of the current crisis is simply a
resource problem—one Congress could help
by sending more resources—and how much is
deliberate mistreatment or neglect from an
administration that doesn’t deserve any
more money or trust.
Border Patrol isn’t prepared to care for
children at all. It’s now housing 2,000 a day.
According to statistics sent to congres-
sional staff last week and obtained by Vox,
between May 14 and June 13, US Border Pa-
trol facilities were housing over 14,000 people
a day—and sometimes as many as 18,000.
(The most recent tally, as of June 13, was
nearly 16,000.)
Most of these were single adults, or par-
ents with children. But consistently, over
that month, around 2,000—2,081 as of June
13—were ‘‘unaccompanied alien children,’’ or
children being held without adult relatives
in separate facilities.
In an early June press call, a Customs and
Border Protection official said, referring to
the total number of people in custody, ‘‘when
we have 4,000 in custody, we consider that
high. 6,000 is a crisis.’’
Traditionally, an ‘‘unaccompanied alien
child’’ refers to a child who comes to the US
without a parent or guardian. Increasingly—
as lawyers have been reporting, and as the
investigators who interviewed children in de-
tention last week confirmed—children are
coming to the US with a relative who is not
their parent, and being separated.
Because the law defines an ‘‘unaccom-
panied’’ child as someone without a parent
or legal guardian here, border agents don’t
have the ability to keep a child with a grand-
parent, aunt or uncle, or even a sibling who’s
over 18, though advocates have also raised
concerns that border agents are separating
relatives even when there is evidence of legal
guardianship.
Under the terms of US law—and especially
the 1997 Flores settlement, which governs
the treatment of children in immigration
custody—immigration agents are obligated
to get unaccompanied children out of immi-
gration detention as quickly as possible, and
to keep them in the least restrictive condi-
tions possible while they’re there. Barring
emergencies, children aren’t supposed to be

in Border Patrol custody for more than 72
hours before being sent to HHS—which is re-
sponsible for finding and vetting a sponsor to
house the child (usually their closest rel-
ative in the United States).
That hasn’t been happening. Attorneys,
doctors, and human rights observers have
consistently reported that children are being
held by Border Patrol for days or longer be-
fore being picked up by HHS. And in the
meantime, they’re being kept in facilities
that weren’t built to hold even adults for
that period of time, or in improvised ‘‘soft-
sided’’ facilities that look like (and are com-
monly referred to as) tents.
The detention conditions crisis doesn’t just
affect children. But conditions for children
are under special legal scrutiny.
Since late last year, US immigration
agents have been overwhelmed by the num-
ber of families coming across the border. The
US immigration system, which was built to
quickly arrest and deport single Mexican
adults crossing into the US to work, doesn’t
have the capacity to deal with tens of thou-
sands of families (mostly from Central
America) who are often seeking asylum in
the US.
The length of time migrants are spending
in Border Patrol custody (and the conditions
there) have attracted some alarm before. In
April, pictures of migrants being held out-
side under a bridge in El Paso, fenced in and
sleeping on the ground, attracted outrage
and led Border Patrol to stop holding mi-
grants there. And in May, the DHS Office of
the Inspector General released an emergency
report about dangerous overcrowding of
adults in two facilities: with up to 900 people
being held in a facility designed to hold 125.
Because of the Flores settlement, lawyers
have the opportunity to investigate condi-
tions for children to see if the government is
complying—and possibly ask a judge to in-
tervene if it is not. That’s what spurred the
fact-finding mission that led to last week’s
stories.
The reports about Clint broke at a time
when the Trump administration was already
playing defense about its compliance with
the Flores settlement. (While the adminis-
tration is working on a regulation that
would supersede the terms of the agreement,
that regulation isn’t expected to be pub-
lished in final form until fall, and may well
be held up in court.)
In a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals hearing
earlier last week about whether the adminis-
tration needed to allow a court appointee to
monitor conditions for children in ICE and
CBP custody, Department of Justice lawyer
Sarah Fabian told judges that children
didn’t necessarily need towels or tooth-
brushes to be in ‘‘safe and sanitary’’ condi-
tions—a clip that looked especially bad when
the Clint stories came out showing the chil-
dren were being denied just that.
The court hearing was not specifically
about the Clint facility—it wasn’t about
what investigators found last week at all.
And as Ken White explained for the Atlantic,
Fabien’s cringeworthy ‘‘safe and sanitary’’
argument came from the awkward stance the
Trump administration has taken in this liti-
gation: In order to challenge the court ap-
pointment of a special monitor, they argued
that there’s a difference between a promise
to keep kids in ‘‘safe and sanitary’’ condi-
tions (which the government has agreed to
for decades) and a guarantee of particular
items like toothbrushes.
The court appeared unimpressed. And the
stories about Clint and other facilities that
have come out in the ensuing days certainly
bolstered the case that the Trump adminis-
tration has either willingly violated its
agreement to keep kids safe and healthy, or
has been unable to keep it—or a mix of both.
The problem isn’t Clint.
The problems that investigators identified
at Clint—too many people, not enough food,
no toothbrushes—weren’t inherent to that
facility. They were indications of an over-
loaded (or neglected) system.
And it’s already clear that those problems
go beyond Clint.
ABC News obtained testimony from a doc-
tor who visited another facility for children
in Texas—the Ursula facility—and witnessed
‘‘extreme cold temperatures, lights on 24
hours a day, no adequate access to medical
care, basic sanitation, water, or adequate
food.’’ She said the conditions were so bad
that they were ‘‘tantamount to intentionally
causing the spread of disease.’’
The children are now being sent from Clint
to a facility that is just as bad, according to
Clara Long of Human Rights Watch, who was
the only member of last week’s investigative
team who visited it.
Long told Vox that when she was there,
the facility in El Paso known as ‘‘Border Pa-
trol Station 1’’ was mostly being used as a
transit center where migrants were staying
only a few hours before going elsewhere. But
she spoke to one family who had been held in
a cell there for six days, and who voiced the
same concerns that children in the Clint fa-
cility did.
The mother of the family, Long said, was
so ashamed of not having clean teeth—the El
Paso facility, like Clint, wasn’t providing
enough toothbrushes—that ‘‘when she was
talking to you she would put her hand up in
front of her mouth and wouldn’t take it
down.’’ The teenage son said he was afraid of
the guards because when he’d gotten up to go
to the bathroom in the middle of the night,
a guard had shoved him back into his cell
and slammed the door on him. For two
nights, the family had had to sleep on the
cold floor without blankets.
The fundamental question: Why is it tak-
ing so long to get kids out of custody—and is
it happening on purpose?
Most of the children who were at Clint
when the team visited last week—about 250
of the 350—were set to be sent to HHS cus-
tody by Tuesday.
Questions remain about what is happening
to the other 1,750 or so children who were in
Border Patrol detention on Thursday if lev-
els have remained static since mid-June, and
why the government was able to place only
250 children over five days with the agency
that’s supposed to take responsibility for all
children within 72 hours.
It’s not clear where the bureaucratic
breakdown really is—and whether it’s the re-
sult of resource constraints or choices about
how resources are used.
The Trump administration definitely has
made a choice to keep single adults in deten-
tion, even if it could release them. Border
Patrol chief Carla Provost has told Congress
that ‘‘if we lose (the ability to keep and de-
port) single adults, we lose the border.’’ That
does raise questions about whether the over-
crowding in adult facilities could be avoided.
But it doesn’t address the issue of unac-
companied children, who can’t simply be re-
leased with a notice to appear in immigra-
tion court. While children with parents in
the US could theoretically be placed with
those parents, the government is supposed to
vet potential sponsors to make sure it’s not
placing children with traffickers—but that’s
the job of HHS, and the vetting doesn’t begin
until children are released from Border Pa-
trol custody.
Observers and policymakers agree that
HHS simply doesn’t have the capacity to
take migrant kids in. One Democratic Hill
staffer compared it to a ‘‘jigsaw puzzle’’: Not
only are there only so many spaces available
to place a child, but the facilities available
might not match the child’s particular
needs. (You can’t put an infant in an HHS
shelter for teens, for example.) But another
Hill staffer told Vox that HHS claims it’s
never refused a transfer for space reasons,
muddying the waters.
Then there’s the question of whether CBP
is really doing all it can to care for kids in
the time they’re in CBP’s care.
One of the Clint observers told Isaac
Chotiner of the New Yorker stories of cru-
elty from some guards, indicating that they
were deliberately punishing children for the
sin of coming to the US without papers. But
she also said that many guards were sympa-
thetic, and told the observers that children
shouldn’t be in their custody—implying that
they were doing the best they could and sim-
ply didn’t have the resources to do more.
(Advocates also say they’ve tried to donate
supplies to Border Patrol facilities but had
their donations rejected; it’s not clear if this
was a Border Patrol decision, or if there’s a
legal complication banning outside dona-
tions.)
Congress is considering a package right
now to give the Trump administration bil-
lions more dollars to deal with migrants
coming into the US. To Democratic leader-
ship, including the appropriators led by Rep.
Lucille Roybal-Allard (D–CA), who drafted
the House version of the supplemental pack-
age, the solution to poor conditions in cus-
tody is to provide more money specifically
to improve those conditions. They emphasize
that the bulk of the funding will go to HHS
to increase capacity for migrant kids and
that funding for ICE and CBP will be strictly
limited to humanitarian use.
But to some progressives, led in Congress
by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, giving any
money to immigration enforcement agencies
right now is an endorsement of the current
state of affairs.
The not-one-more-dime camp, in part, is
taking a bright-line stance against the de-
tention of children. But in part, they’re dem-
onstrating a lack of trust in the administra-
tion to adhere to any law or condition. And
they assume that any money given to ICE
for transit of migrant kids will, in some way
or another, encourage ICE to detain more
families and arrest more immigrants in the
United States.
The ‘‘smart money’’ camp, on the other
hand, believes firmly that without funds to
improve conditions in detention, the condi-
tions will only get worse.
That’s especially relevant in the case of
kids deemed ‘‘unaccompanied,’’ who have to
remain in custody until a sponsor is found.
The past few days have demonstrated that
those children are extremely vulnerable and
that much of the American public wants
their situation to change. It just may not be
clear how.

LAWYERS SAY MIGRANT CHILDREN ARE LIVING
IN ‘TRAUMATIC AND DANGEROUS’ CONDITIONS
AT BORDER DETENTION SITE
(By Ccedar Attanasio, Garance Burke and
Martha Mendoza)
CLINT, TEXAS.—In a tiny Texas town about
a half-hour drive from El Paso, a nondescript
Border Patrol station operated for six years
primarily as a hub for agents on patrol,
drawing little scrutiny from immigration at-
torneys who have been loudly advocating
against mass U.S. detention camps that can
hold more than 2,000 teens at a time.
And so attorneys visiting the Border Pa-
trol station in Clint, Texas, this week said
they were shocked to find more than 250 in-
fants, children and teens inside the complex
of windowless buildings, trying to care for
each other with what they described as inad-
equate food, water and sanitation. ‘‘This fa-
cility wasn’t even on our radar before we

came down here,’’ said law professor Warren
Binford, a member of the team that has
interviewed 60 detainees in Clint.
Binford’s group warned that because Cus-
toms and Border Protection facilities are
overwhelmed with migrants, they feared
similar situations could be unfolding else-
where.
Attorney Toby Gialluca, who visited teens
and their babies last week in a McAllen,
Texas, Border Patrol station, said everyone
she interviewed was very sick with high fe-
vers, coughing, and wearing soiled clothes
crusted with mucus and dirt after their long
trip north. Fifteen kids at Clint had the flu,
another 10 were quarantined. ‘‘Everyone is
sick. Everyone. They’re using their clothes
to wipe mucus off the children, wipe vomit
off the children. Most of the little children
are not fully clothed,’’ she said.
Migrant teens in McAllen told her they
were offered frozen ham sandwiches and rot-
ten food, Gialluca said. In both stations, the
children told attorneys that guards in-
structed girls as young as age 8 to care for
the babies and toddlers.
Border Patrol stations are designed to hold
people for less than three days, but some
children held in Clint and McAllen have been
in there for weeks. Legally, migrants under
18 should be moved into Office of Refugee Re-
settlement care within 72 hours.
But federal officials have said they have
hit a breaking point, with too many migrant
children and nowhere to put them. That’s in
part because over the last year, migrant
children have been staying longer in federal
custody than they had historically, meaning
there are fewer shelter beds in the separate
Office of Refugee and Resettlement program
where kids are sent from the Border Patrol
stations.
Unlike privately contracted child deten-
tion facilities, Border Patrol stations are
federal facilities, exempt from state health
and safety standards, according to Texas De-
partment of Health and Human Services
spokesman John Reynolds. Child abuse and
neglect investigators are not allowed to in-
vestigate the stations because they not li-
censed by the state.
In Clint, Binford described that during
interviews with children in a conference
room at the facility, ‘‘little kids are so tired
they have been falling asleep on chairs and
at the conference table.’’ An 8-year-old tak-
ing care of a very small 4-year-old with mat-
ted hair could not convince the younger girl
to take a shower, Binford said.
The lawyers inspected the Border Patrol
facilities as part of a President Bill Clinton-
era legal agreement known as the Flores set-
tlement that governs detention conditions
for migrant children and families.
Neha Desai, director of Immigration at the
National Center for Youth Law, said Friday
that the U.S. government, attorneys in-
volved in the Flores settlement and an inde-
pendent monitor appointed by the judge
overseeing the Flores settlement are in con-
versation about the situation of children
held in McAllen and Clint.
The Clint facility opened in 2013 with little
fanfare on a country road not far from the
town’s water tower, a liquor store and the
sandwich shop where Border Patrol agents
eat lunch and dinner. The advocate lawyers
who negotiated access to the complex said
Border Patrol officials knew of their impend-
ing visit three weeks in advance.
Customs and Border Protection officials
had no immediate comment, but have said
for months that the agency is at its breaking
point for housing migrants, calling the situa-
tion in the El Paso area a humanitarian and
security crisis.
In an interview earlier this week with The
Associated Press, Customs and Border Pro-
tection John Sanders acknowledged that
children died after being in the agency’s
care, and said Border Patrol stations are cur-
rently holding 15,000 people—more than
three times their maximum capacity of 4,000.
He urged Congress to pass a $4.6 billion
emergency funding package includes nearly
$3 billion to care for unaccompanied migrant
children.
A migrant father, speaking on condition of
anonymity because of his immigration sta-
tus, said he did not know where his daughter
was until one of the attorneys visiting Clint
this week found his phone number written in
permanent marker on a bracelet the girl was
wearing. ‘‘She’s suffering very much because
she’s never been alone. She doesn’t know
these other children,’’ her father said.
Republican Congressman Will Hurd, whose
district includes Clint, said ‘‘tragic condi-
tions’’ playing out on the southern border
were pushing government agencies, non-
profits and Texas communities to the limit.
‘‘This latest development just further dem-
onstrates the immediate need to reform asy-
lum laws and provide supplemental funding
to address the humanitarian crisis at our
border,’’ he said.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker,
before I yield to our next speaker, I
would remind my colleagues that a
vote to defeat the previous question
really isn’t a vote to bring up the Sen-
ate bill. It is a vote to give control of
the House floor to the Republicans.
They say they would bring up the
Senate bill, but there is absolutely no
guarantee that they would. They could
bring up a bill to fund a wall, for all we
know.
Madam Speaker, we are here to find
a way to alleviate the suffering of
these children at our border and not to
play political games. So I would urge
my colleagues to make sure that they
vote ‘‘yes’’ on the previous question.
And, by the way, I just say to my col-
league from Oklahoma, a lot of us
aren’t satisfied with the Senate bill the
way it has been drafted because there
are protections that we want to see in
that bill because, quite frankly, speak-
ing for myself, I don’t trust this admin-
istration.
I don’t trust this administration to
do the right thing, an administration
that separated—knowingly and delib-
erately separated—children from their
parents at the border, an administra-
tion that tolerated the conditions that
have horrified the entire country.
So I want it clear that the moneys
that we are appropriating are going to
help children, not to continue this in-
sane inhumane policy that has horri-
fied this Nation.
I won’t trust this administration to
tell me the correct time, at this par-
ticular point. So, no, we are not satis-
fied. We want more protections in here
for the children. We want more trans-
parency. The American people, I think,
expect that. We should provide them
that information.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentlewoman from California (Mrs.
TORRES), the distinguished member of
the Rules Committee.
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise in support of the rule.
Yes, indeed, we have a responsibility
to act. As Speaker PELOSI has said, we
must do this for the sake of the chil-
dren, and I thank her for not
capitulating to the Senate demands for
a blank check.
When I reflect on the number of
deaths that we have seen at the border,
when I reflect on the horrific condi-
tions in facilities where children are
being held in ice-cold cells with no one
to care for them but a child stranger—
conditions in these facilities are hor-
rific—I ask myself: Is this the America
that I came to as a young child? Is this
the America that my son swore to pro-
tect when he joined the U.S. Air Force?
This surely isn’t the country that wel-
comed me as a young child from Guate-
mala.
But we must work toward that Amer-
ican ideal that we all share. We cannot
simply allocate funds to agencies
where we have seen numerous children
die in their custody.
No blank checks.
No more torturing of babies.
No more separating infants from
their mothers.
This legislation brings funds to the
children that are urgently needed.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield the gentlewoman an additional 30
seconds.
Mrs. TORRES of California. It brings
more transparency to CBP and ICE and
HHS, and it contains important provi-
sions to protect children. It ensures
that the emergency funding that Con-
gress provides is spent on what it is in-
tended for and not the President’s de-
portation force.
So I look forward to supporting this
rule, and I urge all of my colleagues to
join me in doing so.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 3
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO), my
very good friend and distinguished
member of the Rules Committee.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, well,
here we are again, and I talked on this
before.
I am from the State of Arizona, so
border security is top and center of the
discussion in Arizona and it has, quite
frankly, been for years.
We have all known there has been a
crisis at our border for many, many
years, and that is why I am at least
hopeful and inspired a little bit that
my Democratic colleagues are actually
admitting—finally—that there is a cri-
sis at our border. So that is good.
The thing that is bad about this rule
today is that I just don’t understand. I
guess some of my Democratic col-
leagues are just being stubborn be-
cause, on the one hand, you have the
Senate that already passed an over-
whelmingly bipartisan bill, where Sen-
ator SCHUMER voted for it. You have a
President who said we are not in favor
of this House version of the bill.
So here you have a President who,
seemingly, is willing to sign the Senate
bill; you have a Senate bill that has
vast bipartisan support, even with the

top leadership in the Democrat Party;
but, yet, here we are in the House, and
I guess Members just want to make
sure they have what they want in their
bill, even if it is not going to pass and
even if the money isn’t going to actu-
ally get to solving the problem.
And so I ask my Democrat colleagues
to put your stubbornness a little bit
aside, because if we all have the goal,
as has been said on both sides, to help
solve this problem, to help with the
children who are dying at the border,
you know—what was it? Yesterday we
saw the picture of the father and the
daughter, and then June 14, we had a
story in Arizona of a young 7-year-old
girl who died, and the Arizona Air Na-
tional Guard helped find and rescued
other members of the party. I think we
are united in trying to solve the prob-
lem, and I am glad that my Democrats
finally say there is a crisis, to have ac-
knowledged it.
But if you really want to help, let’s
stop this. Okay. Let’s stop what you
are doing, because I don’t think you
are going to win. You have the Presi-
dent on one side, the Senate on one
side with bipartisan support, including
Mr. SCHUMER, and yet we are here
today, right before the July Fourth re-
cess, and instead of giving in and say-
ing let’s just put up the Senate bill
that we know is going to pass, that we
know is going to help, you continue to,
I guess, try to make a point.

Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield

Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I sin-
cerely hope the Members have made

ness of doing what we are supposed to
do in Congress: Pass a bill, pass the bi-
partisan Senate bill, but, also, let’s
work together on actually reforming
our immigration laws, the root of the
problem that is causing this problem,
so we are not back here in 6 months or
1 year doing this again.

Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
would like to remind the gentlewoman
that we are members of the Democratic
Party, not the Democrat Party, and I
would appreciate it if we were charac-
terized correctly.
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.
MUCARSEL-POWELL).
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Madam
Speaker, I rise today in support of this
rule.
Right now, there are thousands of
children detained in temporary facili-
ties, facilities like the ones in Home-
stead, which is right in the middle of
my district. We have no answers. We
have no idea of when these kids are
going to be released. It is an over-
crowded facility, with kids who are
sleeping in warehouse areas on bunk
beds, of more than 144 kids.
They are living in prison-like condi-
tions. Many have been there for
months. These kids should not be de-
tained without their freedom and their
rights. What we are asking from the
Senate are reasonable requests for the
safety and for the well-being of thou-
sands of children.
We have to pass these provisions put
forth by the House. We must put in
writing that no child can be held and
detained in a temporary facility like
Homestead for more than 90 days.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield an additional 30 seconds to the
gentlewoman from Florida.
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Madam
Speaker, many of the children have
families living right here in the United
States that they could be reunited
with. But those who are running the fa-
cilities have no incentive for reuniting
them.
The Senate bill does not have a
timeline. The Senate bill is inadequate.
We must pass the House-amended bill.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I know my friends are aware of this,
but the Senate bill is actually—well, I
certainly would vote for it. I think it
would have overwhelming support on
our side. The President, in the past,
has expressed some concerns, and that
is an important thing, but the Senate
has really worked through a lot of
these differences.
The bill that we would like to see put
on this floor and that we know would
pass with overwhelming, bipartisan
support is a product of compromise, so
much compromise that the entire
Democratic leadership felt comfortable
voting for it.
With all due respect to my friends,
their bill is not the product of com-
promise. It is not going to get very
many Republican votes here, if any. I
would be surprised, frankly, if it did. It
is not going to get accepted by the
United States Senate. It absolutely
won’t be signed by the President of the
United States.
We are all concerned about the condi-
tions. We have been expressing that
concern for 8 weeks. We never called
this a manufactured crisis. We never
said that this was made up for political
purposes. The administration recog-
nized it 8 weeks ago.
We have tried multiple times to get
this House to focus on it. I am very
pleased that we finally reached a point
that both sides are focusing on it. But
we also ought to focus on what is pos-
sible to achieve in a limited timeframe.
We know we are running out of
money. We know there are real-life
consequences to that. They are start-
ing to unfold right now. There are serv-
ices being cut back. For a lot of these
conditions, frankly, we ought to look
in the mirror, as Congress, and ask why
we didn’t get these resources there a
long time ago.
Frankly, the House rule that we are
discussing on the House bill, that bill
actually reduces resources at the bor-
der. It doesn’t expand them. It reduces
them. It reduces them also for the
American military. That is part of it.
The Senate bill, in my view, frankly,
is much superior to my friends’ prod-
uct, but it has one virtue above all: All
we have to do is put it on the floor and
pass it, and it goes to the President of
the United States to be signed imme-
diately. Resources begin to move to
where they are desperately needed im-
mediately.
That is not true with my friends’ bill.
All it does is reopen the dialogue with
the Senate, where it has very little
prospect of passing. Then, frankly, if it
did pass—not likely—it would be ve-
toed.
I am befuddled, Madam Speaker, that
they are pursuing a goal that they
know will not work, but we have seen
this time and time again. It is more
important to get a bill across the floor
in a partisan fashion than it is to put
something on the floor that is bipar-
tisan, that can pass the Senate and
come into law.
Now, my friends know we live in an
era of divided government, and we have
wasted 6 months, in my view, dealing
with a lot of things that we knew
would never pass. But I respect my
friends’ right to bring their agenda to
the floor.
This is different. This is a national
emergency. It has to pass. We have one
vehicle where it can be passed and be
signed so that help can go imme-
diately. We have my friends’ vehicle,
which I know they believe in passion-
ately, and I respect that, but it can’t
pass.
It is pretty simple. Sooner or later, I
hope we get to the obvious answer and
pass the Senate bill and send it to the
President.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB).
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I take
offense to my colleague from Arizona
saying we are not going to win. This is
not a game. These are people’s lives.
When my colleague says we need to
try, we have tried. I am asking them to
try harder because we are creating a
whole generation of children, Madam
Speaker, who will remember what we
did. They will remember that we caged
them up like animals. We ripped them
away from their parents and pumped
them with drugs to make them stop
crying for their mothers.
No amount of apologizing and no
amount of debating in this Chamber
will make it better, Madam Speaker. I
am asking my colleagues to be more
humane, to debate real policy change
that will address the crisis at the bor-
der, like comprehensive immigration
reform.
We must do better for these children.
Again, no amount of apologizing, no
amount of debating, no amount of poli-
ticking will make it better.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5240 June 27, 2019
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I will just make the same point I
have been making for days on end. We
have something that can pass versus
something that can’t. I don’t doubt for
a minute that my friends are sincere in
their concerns, but I also respect my
colleagues on the other side of the ro-
tunda in the United States Senate. I
think they are sincere, too.
They have worked through and found
a way to get something that got 84
votes. Three-quarters of the Demo-
cratic minority in the Senate voted for
it. The entire Democratic leadership
voted for it. The President has signaled
that he will sign it.
We can continue the debates on some
of these other things at a later point.
My friends might want to come back
with another piece of legislation ad-
dressing some of their concerns that
they think are not appropriately ad-
dressed in the Senate bill. But the re-
ality is that is the bill that can pass.
The bill that they want to bring to this
floor cannot.
We all agree there is a crisis. We all
agree we need resources there. I think
my friends know, if they would just put
the Senate bill on the floor, it could
pass, and it would go to the President.
We can continue to have this debate.
We can even end it, launch some vehi-
cle over to the Senate, and waste more
time. That is all it will be, a waste of
time.
I would hope we have all had our say.
We all feel strongly about our points,
but let’s agree on the one thing we
know can pass and the President would
sign, which would get us resources and
relief immediately on the border where
we desperately need it.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I thank the gentleman for yielding, and
I appreciate the gentleman from Okla-
homa, but I am an optimist.
More importantly, I stand here in the
name of Mr. Ramirez and his little,
baby girl who were found on the shores
of the Rio Grande. The question is:
How did they wind up there? They
wound up there because of this admin-
istration’s policies that rejected them
as they stood on the Brownsville-Mata-
moros International Bridge.
There was no reason to say the bridge
was closed. They had a legal right to
claim asylum, fleeing from the horrible
violence of El Salvador. Yet, they
could not stand there, and so this is
their end.
I am supporting this bill because I
believe we should not settle for just
anything. This bill particularly pro-
vides for the requirements that have
additional resources for these children
so that they don’t die, so that they do
have toothpaste, that they are clean,
that they are living in clean places. It
acknowledges that children cannot be
held like cattle in one place beyond 90
days, that you must find their family
members, and, yes, there are family
members.
This is a process that has been the
law of the land and the international
law for decades. It is an asylum that
can be sought so the Nation can ad-
dress it. It takes no one’s place. It does
nothing to hurt this Nation.
I support the underlying legislation
because, in the name of Mr. Ramirez
and his child, we must do what is right.
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I personally thank my good friend,
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.
JACKSON LEE), for the professional and
very patient manner in which she han-
dled the Chair and presided over this
body. I wanted to recognize that.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the distinguished gentleman from New
York (Mr. KATKO), my very good friend.
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I, too,
want to recognize my colleague from
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for having the
coolest scarf in the House today, the
American flag.
Bipartisanship has broken out in the
Senate. They passed H.R. 3401, as
amended, 84–8.
I am now happy to report to the
House that bipartisanship has broken
out on the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives, for I am announcing that
23 Democrats and 23 Republicans from
the Problem Solvers Caucus have just
issued the following statement: ‘‘Given
the humanitarian crisis at the border,
the Problem Solvers Caucus is asking
for the immediate consideration on the
House floor today of H.R. 3401, as
amended by the Senate.’’
We now are certain that H.R. 3401
will pass. I ask us to let the bipartisan-
ship spread to the rest of this House
and put an end to this now, once and
for all, and get the help to the border
that is so badly needed.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker,
may I inquire how much time is re-
maining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
JACKSON LEE). The gentleman from
Massachusetts has 4 minutes remain-
ing. The gentleman from Oklahoma has
81⁄4 minutes remaining.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from
California (Mr. CÁRDENAS).
Mr. CÁRDENAS. Madam Speaker, I
have the honor and privilege to be born
as an American citizen. There are bil-
lions of people around the world who
don’t have that privilege, that honor,
and that blessing.
Today, I get to exercise my privilege
as a Member of Congress to bring my
two grandchildren, ages 1 and 3, to the
floor of the House of Representatives.
It is a very emotional moment for me
because when I see their beautiful
brown eyes, I see their grandparents
who were born in another country, and
I see their great-grandparents born in
another country, just like many people
on this House floor whose grandparents
and great-grandparents came from Ger-
many, Guatemala, Mexico, or any
other place on the planet.
We are fighting to do what is right,
to do what is right for the gold stand-
ard that the world has seen in the
United States of America, a place of
hope and a place of future for people
who are fleeing persecution for reli-
gious reasons or otherwise to be able to
come to this country, kiss the ground
that they walk on, and start anew.
My beautiful grandkids get to be
American citizens because somebody
made the journey sometime before
them.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
yield an additional 30 seconds to the
gentleman from California.
Mr. CÁRDENAS. Madam Speaker, I
will close by saying this: The United
States of America has always been the
gold standard, and that is the argu-
ment that we are making here today.
This is not a game. We are fighting
for the lives of human beings who
should have the opportunity to be just
like every person on this floor: to be al-
lowed the freedom to be who they
choose to be, who God made them to
be, by being in the greatest place on
the planet. That is why we are fighting
today.
b 1315
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. STIVERS), who is
my good friend.
Mr. STIVERS. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding. We
have a crisis on our southern border,
and H.R. 3401 with the Senate amend-
ments gets resources to give humani-
tarian assistance to those seeking asy-
lum.
It also adds judges and judge teams
to hear the claims of asylum. Many
people have to wait up to 3 years to get
their hearing. That is too long. I have
twice in the last 2 weeks attempted to
offer an amendment to add judge
teams. Both times, the Rules Com-
mittee has failed to include it.
My amendment this week would have
included the amount that was in the
Senate bill, but it is now in the bill be-
cause we have the Senate bill sitting at
the Speaker’s desk.
I urge my colleagues to take up the
bill with the Senate amendments that
include judge teams. That is the only
way to solve this real crisis: adjudicate
the claims of these people who want
asylum, reunite families, and stop peo-
ple from being held in detention as
long.
Mr. GONZALEZ from Texas and I have
worked together on this. It is a bipar-
tisan effort. This is a no-brainer. We
need to add judges. The Senate bill
does that.
Madam Speaker, I hope we can take
up the Senate bill and make it happen.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
reserve the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5241
June 27, 2019
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, in closing, I urge
opposition to this rule. Once again, the
majority is making the exact same
mistake it made earlier this week. We
have a bipartisan bill already approved
by the Senate. The House should sim-
ply take it up and work its will on that
bill.
Frankly, we all know, if that bill
were allowed to come to the floor, it
would pass overwhelmingly with a ma-
jority of each side voting in favor of it.
Then it wouldn’t have to go back to
the Senate. It would go immediately to
the President of the United States. He
could sign it, and these resources
would begin to flow.
Now, again, we have had a robust de-
bate today, and I respect the passions
on both sides and every point of view
about this. Actually, I see a great deal
of common agreement. We agree, which
we did not 8 weeks ago, that there is an
emergency on the southern border. We
agree it is a humanitarian crisis. We
agree there need to be resources that
go there immediately. We agree that
time is short.
We are also all elected officials who
are privileged to be in this Chamber,
and my experience with my friends on
both sides of the aisle is that they are
basically pretty practical people. They
came here to solve problems. They
have different viewpoints, but they are
almost always very practical and try
to get something done.
We know the Senate bill is not every-
thing that my side would want. We cer-
tainly know it is not everything that
my friend’s side would want. But we
know it is bipartisan. We know three-
quarters of the Democrats in the other
Chamber voted for it. We know it will
pass.
With all due respect to my friends,
they have clung so tightly to their bill,
which I know they believe in. It will
pass here, but it won’t pass the Senate,
and it certainly won’t be signed by the
President.
Where will we be if we continue down
the road that they are laying out in
front of us?
I know they are sincerely concerned
about children on the border, but we
are better off with a bill that passes so
we have billions of dollars moving to
where they are supposed to go, and a
bill, by the way, that the entire Demo-
cratic leadership thought was appro-
priate and good enough.
Let’s not sit here and make the per-
fect the enemy of the good. Let’s be
practical and deliver to the American
people what they want, which is a solu-
tion, a solution that both parties will
vote for and a solution that the Presi-
dent will sign.
How many times do we go home and
hear that from our own constituents:
Can’t you guys get together and do
anything? Can’t you work together?
Can’t you put aside your differences
and put the American people first?
It pains me as a House Member to
admit it, I suppose, but the United
States Senate did that in this case be-
fore we did. We can accept that and
move on, and my friends can continue
to fight for the things they believe. It
is not as if, for these things that are in
this bill that the administration won’t
accept, they can’t wrap them up again
and put them back in another bill and
start the process.
If we do not act, the resources will
not get to the border where they are
needed, and these conditions that con-
cern us all will continue.
I urge us to step back a little bit, ac-
cept that in this case the Senate has a
bipartisan solution that will work, and
for goodness’ sake, just put it on the
floor to see what happens.
We know what will happen. My
friends will vote for it in overwhelming
numbers. My friends on my side of the
aisle will vote for it in overwhelming
numbers. It will go straight to the
President of the United States.
That isn’t going to solve the prob-
lem, but it is going to ease the prob-
lem, and that is going to move us in
the right direction and provide our
very hard-pressed people—who are
working this problem by caring for the
migrants, trying to protect our bor-
ders, and trying to provide justice—the
resources they need to continue to
work on this problem while, frankly,
we continue to try to arrive at a legis-
lative solution.
Madam Speaker, I want to end with a
point I made just a little bit earlier. I
thank the Chair for the patient and
professional manner in which she has
allowed us to conduct this debate. I
thank her very much for making sure
that when we had an outside disturb-
ance, it was quickly dealt with.
I urge my friends to reconsider and,
hopefully, come together around a bill
that neither of us thinks is perfect but
both of us could probably vote for and
the President could sign.
Madam Speaker, I thank my good
friend, the chairman of the Rules Com-
mittee, for his participation in debate.
It is always helpful and always enlight-
ening. He is a good friend and a person
I admire a great deal, even when we
differ on a particular issue.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
think what is so frustrating to so many
of us is that there is controversy
around language to guarantee the pro-
tection of these children. The reason
we think that is important is because
this administration has ignored all the
warnings.
We have had whistleblowers talk
about the abuse at the border and how
these children were being mistreated,
and they did nothing.
This administration oversaw a policy
of literally tearing children away from
their parents. As a dad, I can’t imagine
what that must be like for any of those
parents, and yet this administration
thought it was fine.
We have a crisis at the border largely
as a result of this President’s policies.
We need to deal with it, and we need to
deal with it now. But we want to make
sure we are actually dealing with the
crisis and not giving him more money
to create other crises.
I appreciate what the gentleman
from Oklahoma said about the need for
us to continue to work together, and
while these negotiations are con-
tinuing.
Madam Speaker, I withdraw the reso-
lution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution is withdrawn.

ered as ordered on the motion to its adoption

tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized for 1 hour.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, for
the purpose of debate only, I yield the
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE),
pending which I yield myself such time
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts?
There was no objection.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we
had a robust debate here today sur-
rounding the tragedy that is unfolding
on our southern border where children
are being ripped from their families;
forced to sleep on cold concrete floors;
denied soap, medicine, diapers—I could
go on and on and on—all because of the
President’s failed policies.
That is what many of us believe, and
that is what most national and inter-
national human rights organizations
have also made clear.
Quite frankly, this should shake all
of us to our core. I, for one, am very
disappointed, and I will never forget
the images and the stories. I will con-
tinue to fight for a better outcome and
fight for these kids.
Having said all of that, it has been
decided that we should move forward,
so we are amending this rule so we can
take up the Senate-passed bill.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
I want to begin by thanking my
friend. I think this is a wise decision. I
know it was a difficult decision, but I
think it is the right thing because I
know we have a common objective
here.
We know we need resources at the
border right away. We know, by the ac-
tion my friend is taking, we now have
the possibility of making that happen
and doing it in a very bipartisan way;
that is, taking a bill that passed the
Senate 87–8, moving it here with a very
substantial bipartisan majority, and,
frankly, getting resources to exactly
where I know my friend and his col-
leagues want them to go, which is to
help folks at the border deal with this
ever-mounting crisis.
Mr. Speaker, I urge that we accept
the amendment. I thank my friend. I
thank our friends on the other side for
making what I know is a tough but, I
think, a very wise decision. I think the
country will be better off for it.
I appreciate the fact that we will
pass this legislation in a bipartisan
manner. As the Senate did, we will
here. The President will sign it, and
the resources that we all want to ar-
rive and help alleviate the difficult sit-
uation at the border will start moving
immediately.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ap-
preciate the gentleman from Oklahoma
working with us. We have spent many
hours up in the Rules Committee and
on the floor, and I know he is com-
mitted to trying to get this issue right.
AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. MCGOVERN
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I have
an amendment at the desk.

Clerk will report the amendment.

MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING
MIGRANTS WHO HAVE DIED AT-
TEMPTING TO REACH THE
SHORES OF THE UNITED STATES
(Ms. ESCOBAR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, today I
ask that we observe a moment of si-
lence for the migrants who have died as
they have tried to reach the shores of
the America that they dream of.
The photograph that all of us saw
this week should tear all of us up, for
those of us who are parents, to see a
toddler with her little arms wrapped
around the neck of her father.
There is nothing that we wouldn’t do
for our children, nothing, to give them
a better life.
Oscar and Valeria represent tens of
thousands of migrants who have died
as they have tried to build a better life
for themselves, only to find that they
are demonized and locked out of the
promise that those of us who are nat-
ural born citizens are so fortunate to
enjoy.
In their name, let us never forget
their sacrifice and the sacrifice that so
many parents make for the most vul-
nerable among us.

protect elections for public office by
providing financial support and en-

The Clerk read the title of the bill.
MOTION TO RECOMMIT
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I have a motion to recommit
at the desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the
gentleman opposed to the bill?
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. I am
in its current form.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve a point of order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point
of order is reserved.
The Clerk will report the motion to

The Clerk read as follows:
Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois moves to re-
commit the bill H.R. 2722 to the Committee
on House Administration with instructions
to report the same back to the House forth-
with with the following amendment:
Page 72, insert after line 3 the following
(and conform the succeeding provisions ac-
cordingly):
TITLE IV—DISCLOSURE OF FOREIGN NA-
TIONAL ACCESS TO ELECTION INFRA-
STRUCTURE
SEC. 401. DISCLOSURE OF ACCESS TO ELECTION
INFRASTRUCTURE BY FOREIGN NA-
TIONALS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Title III of the Help
America Vote Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. 21081 et
seq.), as amended by section 121, is further
amended by inserting after section 303A the
following new section:
‘‘SEC. 303B. ACCESS TO ELECTION INFRASTRUC-
TURE BY FOREIGN NATIONALS.
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—Each chief State elec-
tion official shall disclose to the Commission
the identity of any foreign national known
by the chief State election official—
‘‘(1) to have physically handled—
‘‘(A) ballots used in an election for Federal
office; or
‘‘(B) voting machines; or
‘‘(2) to have had unmonitored access to—
‘‘(A) a storage facility or centralized vote
tabulation location used to support the ad-
ministration of an election for public office;
or
‘‘(B) election-related information or com-
munications technology, including voter reg-
istration databases, voting machines, elec-
tronic mail and other communications sys-
tems (including electronic mail and other
systems of vendors who have entered into
contracts with election agencies to support
the administration of elections, manage the
election process, and report and display elec-
tion results), and other systems used to man-
age the election process and to report and
display election results on behalf of an elec-
tion agency.
‘‘(b) TIMING.—The chief State election offi-
cial shall make the disclosure under sub-
section (a) not later than 30 days after the
date on which such official becomes aware of
an activity described in such subsection.
‘‘(c) FOREIGN NATIONAL DEFINED.—The
term ‘foreign national’ has the meaning
given that term in section 319 of the Federal
Election Campaign Act of 1971 (52 U.S.C.
30121).’’.
(b) CLERICAL AMENDMENT.—The table of
contents of such Act is amended by inserting
after the item relating to section 303A the
following new item:
‘‘Sec. 303B. Access to election infrastructure
by foreign nationals.’’.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois (dur-
ing the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent to waive the read-
ing of the motion to recommit.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois?
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Il-
linois is recognized for 5 minutes in
support of his motion.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I rise in support of the motion
to recommit.
For months, we have heard about the
interference in our elections and the
report of Special Counsel Robert
Mueller, this report right here. But
nothing in this bill that we are debat-
ing today and voting on today before
this body now addresses the concerns
that have been raised in this report.
Mr. Speaker, nothing in the bill we
are debating today addresses the con-
cerns of foreign interference raised in
the special counsel’s report that I am
holding right now. What we know is
that Russia attempted to interfere in
our 2016 election through a misin-
formation campaign, email hacking,
and by exploring vulnerabilities of reg-
istration databases. This is gravely
concerning to every Republican and
Democrat in this institution.
But what does the Federal Govern-
ment telling States that they must re-
place their safe, new, and auditable
machines have to do with addressing
these concerns? What does a hand re-
count mandate have to do with these
concerns? What does recycled paper
have to do with these concerns?
The tremendous costs associated
with these Federal mandates only
serve to draw resources away from the
real vulnerabilities our States face.
My colleagues on the other side of
the aisle have also represented that Re-
publicans have done nothing to address
foreign interference in our elections,
and that, Mr. Speaker, is simply not
true.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5244 June 27, 2019
In 2017, this country’s election infra-
structure was designated as critical in-
frastructure, thereby allowing the De-
partment of Homeland Security to im-
mediately begin offering voluntary as-
sistance to State and local election of-
ficials in the form of cybersecurity ad-
visers, assessments, threat detection
and prevention tools, information shar-
ing, and incident response.
Additionally, the 115th Congress, last
Congress, a Republican-controlled Con-
gress, appropriated $380 million to
States prior to the 2018 midterms to
bolster election security and $26 mil-
lion to DHS to add additional staff and
carry out their assessment efforts, al-
lowing for unprecedented cooperation
between DHS and all 50 States and 1,400
localities in 2018.
Earlier this year, $33 million was ap-
propriated to DHS to continue these
assistance efforts, and earlier this
week, the Republicans, my fellow Re-
publicans, Mr. WALKER and Mr.
LOUDERMILK, on the House Administra-
tion Committee, introduced our own
Election Security Assistance Act.
So don’t tell me we are not taking
this seriously.
While so much of the focus has been
on foreign interference today, we must
not forget that we had a Member not
seated this Congress following evidence
that political operatives illegally har-
vested unsealed and only partially
filled-out ballots. This practice is legal
in many States, but as we have seen, it
is ripe for fraud and abuse.
Republicans have offered multiple
amendments to prohibit this practice
in H.R. 1 and, now, the SAFE Act, each
failing on a party-line vote. If we can’t
agree that this fraudulent practice
should be banned, let us at least agree
that foreign nationals should not be
harvesting the ballots of American
citizens.
Right now, a Russian operative could
walk freely around States like Cali-
fornia, for example, collecting and
turning in absentee ballots, completely
altering the outcome of an election.
But my colleagues have shown no in-
terest in addressing this huge vulnera-
bility simply because it serves their in-
terest only in certain States.
This practice invites a constitutional
crisis. America, Mr. Speaker, is watch-
ing this vote right now. My amend-
ment today would require the chief
election official of each State to dis-
close to the Election Assistance Com-
mission the identity of any known for-
eign national who has physically han-
dled ballots, machines, or has had
unmonitored access to the storage fa-
cilities or tabulation centers used to
support elections, or even unmonitored
access to election-related information
or communication technology. This
takes an additional step in rooting out
foreign interference and lets the proc-
ess of legislating about election secu-
rity finally begin.
I urge my colleagues to vote for this
motion to recommit. Vote to protect
our elections from interference from
foreign countries like Russia, China,
and all others. Vote to preserve the in-
tegrity of our ballot, and vote to re-
store the American people’s trust in
our institutions.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I with-
draw my point of order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
ervation of a point of order is with-
drawn.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I claim
the time in opposition to the motion to
recommit.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California is recognized
for 5 minutes.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I want
to make an important observation. The
gentleman has said that what happened
in North Carolina is perfectly legal in
other States. Fraud is not legal in any
of the 50 States.
I would like to note that, in our bill,
we do have provisions that vendors
must be owned and controlled by citi-
zens or permanent residents of the
United States and certain other provi-
sions relative to security; but to
conflate the allowance in some
States—of 27 States and 9 others that
designate allowing your mother or
your brother or your neighbor to take
your ballot with fraud is really pretty
low.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from California (Mr. AGUILAR).
Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding.
In our democracy, we should actively
be seeking ways to involve more people
rather than shutting them out of the
process. Some States have done this by
making voting accessible for home-
bound voters and others who have trou-
ble physically getting to the polls and
allowing an absentee voter to designate
anyone of their choosing to drop off a
marked ballot. This policy allows for
greater participation in elections be-
cause some homebound voters have no
family or individuals to delegate that
role to. They should not be
disenfranchised by our laws.
Ballot drop-off laws are, in and of
themselves, perfectly appropriate elec-
tion administration laws. If your aunt
or uncle is a physician of an H1B visa
holder, if you are working a double
shift and you hand your ballot to some-
one who is a Dreamer, if you are mar-
ried to an individual with TPS status,
this would require you to report that
individual to the Federal Government.
The House Administration Com-
mittee is already reviewing the foreign
influence on American elections as the
chairwoman mentioned, and we wel-
come the minority working with us in
this regard. We know, from a Wash-
ington Post story published earlier this
year, in which Members here in this
Chamber are quoted as developing a
strategy to engage in that practice
themselves.
In fact, our colleagues on the other
side of the aisle were quoted as being
laser focused on ballot collection in the
2020 elections. So they will have to for-
give me if I don’t buy into the argu-
ment they are making today that their
favorite examples of potential prob-
lems with the system are actions of a
political operative on behalf of a Re-
publican candidate who illegally
changed and threw away ballots.
This is a suppression tactic. It is the
height of hypocrisy that our Repub-
lican colleagues would be creating a
new Federal standard after this entire
debate they had been railing against
the same. They will forgive us if we
feel that that is a little disingenuous.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
defeat this motion.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I would
close by urging every Member to vote
against this motion to recommit and
further note that the House Adminis-
tration Committee will soon be exam-
ining foreign influence on our elec-
tions. We would welcome the participa-
tion of the minority in that important
work.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit.
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion to recommit.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the noes appeared to have it.
RECORDED VOTE
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.
A recorded vote was ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair
will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum
time for any electronic vote on the
question of passage.

ing the Memorandum of Agreement on Informa-

panied alien children from being placed in dan-
ger, and the Secretary shall provide a written
justification to Congress and the Inspector Gen-
eral of the Department of Health and Human
Services in advance of implementing such
changes.
(c) Within 15 days of the Secretary’s commu-

SEC. 404. None of the funds made available in
this Act under the heading ‘‘Department of
Health and Human Services—Administration for
Children and Families—Refugee and Entrant

279(g)(2))) in any facility that is not State-li-
censed for the care of unaccompanied alien chil-
dren, except in the case that the Secretary de-
termines that housing unaccompanied alien
children in such a facility is necessary on a tem-
porary basis due to an influx of such children or
an emergency, provided that—
(1) the terms of the grant or contract for the
operations of any such facility that remains in
operation for more than six consecutive months
shall require compliance with—
(A) the same requirements as licensed place-
ments, as listed in Exhibit 1 of the Flores Settle-

SEC. 405. In addition to the existing Congres-
sional notification for formal site assessments of
potential influx facilities, the Secretary shall

House of Representatives and the Senate at
least 15 days before operationalizing an unli-
censed facility, and shall (1) specify whether the
facility is hard-sided or soft-sided, and (2) pro-
vide analysis that indicates that, in the absence
of the influx facility, the likely outcome is that
unaccompanied alien children will remain in the
custody of the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity for longer than 72 hours or that unaccom-
panied alien children will be otherwise placed in
danger. Within 60 days of bringing such a facil-
ity online, and monthly thereafter, the Sec-

MOTION TO CONCUR
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I have a
motion at the desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will designate the motion.
The text of the motion is as follows:
Mrs. Lowey moves that the House concur
in the Senate amendment to H.R. 3401.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 466, the mo-
tion shall be debatable for 1 hour
equally divided and controlled by the
chair and ranking minority member of
the Committee on Appropriations.
The gentlewoman from New York
(Mrs. LOWEY) and the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. GRANGER) each will
control 30 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks on the motion cur-
rently under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), the Speaker of the
House.
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the distinguished chairwoman for
yielding and admire her for her distin-
guished and hard work to bring a solu-
tion to the floor. This is not the one
that we had hoped for, but it is one
that we will be voting on today.
Mr. Speaker, I thank NITA LOWEY,
Congresswoman LUCILLE ROYBAL-
ALLARD, Congresswoman ROSA
DELAURO, and all of the appropriators
for their relentless good faith work on
a strong bill that we had hoped would
completely protect vulnerable chil-
dren, keep America safe, and honor our
values.
Today, sadly, and almost with a bro-
ken heart, those values are being un-
dermined by failed policies which have
intensified a situation of heartbreak
and horror on the border, all of which
challenges the conscience of America.
I will be brief in just saying, right
now, children need their families.
Right now, little children are enduring
trauma and terror; many are living in
squalor at the border station, patrol
station; some are sleeping on the cold
ground without warm blankets or hot
meals.
Kids as young as 7 and 8 years old are
watching over infants because no one
else is there to care for them. As one
little girl caring for two infants said: I
need comfort, too. I am bigger than
they are, but I am a child, too.
Mr. Speaker, we could have done so
much better—so much better—than
what we are faced with today. It is my
belief, my colleagues, that our country
is at a moment of truth in acting upon
our values as we develop policies.
I am proud of the work that our ap-
propriators in the House have done in
passing a bill that received over-
whelming Democratic support on Tues-
day. It was even bipartisan.
The current situation on the border
is shameful and does not reflect Amer-
ica’s values. We don’t need anyone—es-
pecially the United States Senate—to
tell us what the needs are on the bor-
der and that we have to act expedi-
tiously.
Our Members are very well versed
and excellent representatives of the re-
gions they represent and that are af-
fected, but we want to find a path to

CORRECTION
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5249
June 27, 2019
improve the conditions under which we
are addressing and ministering to the
needs of children and families there.
We are gravely disappointed in the
actions taken by the Senate in oppos-
ing the regular order of the Congress of
the United States. We will continue to
fight for our values and priorities in
our legislation and beyond.
Our strongest ally in getting a better
policy than that which was passed by
the Republican Senate is public opin-
ion. And people and institutions of
good faith in our country, our faith-
based institutions who minister to the
needs of our immigrants, know that
this is not the best way to go. So as we
go forward, we will continue to fight
for our values with public opinion and
faith-based organizations on our side.
The American people are constantly
asking the question: Why aren’t we
doing a better job to respect the dig-
nity and worth of our children? The
dignity and worth of our children. The
dignity and worth of our children.
That might amuse you, but it is not
amusing to the children who are af-
fected.
The children come first. At the end of
the day, we have to make sure that the
resources needed to protect the chil-
dren are available. Therefore, we will
not engage in the same disrespectful
behavior that the Senate did in ignor-
ing the House priorities.
In order to get resources to the chil-
dren fastest, we will reluctantly put
the Senate bill on the floor. As the
Senate bill passes—when it does, if it
does—it will not be the end of this de-
bate. It will be the battle cry. It will be
the battle cry as to how we go forward
to protect children in a way that truly
honors their dignity and worth, their
spark of divinity that they are all chil-
dren of God.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR), our
colleague, for the beautiful moment of
silence that she held earlier.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues
for their leadership to protect values,
honor our values, keep America safe.
As always, with every vote, it is a vote
of conscience.
The situation at the border is a chal-
lenge to the conscience of America. It
should be a challenge to the conscience
of each and every one of us. As always,
you must vote your conscience.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, the hu-
manitarian situation at our southern
border is disgraceful. The Trump ad-
ministration has exacerbated a crisis
that has led to intolerable conditions
for children and families in the govern-
ment’s care.
We have been advised that agencies
that provide critical services for chil-
dren, including the Office of Refugee
Resettlement and Customs and Border
Protection, will imminently run out of
funds.
Earlier this week, the House passed a
comprehensive bill to fund these agen-
cies and provide important reforms to
ensure that children in our govern-
ment’s care are safe, healthy, and com-
fortable.
Sadly, the White House, which has
done so much to create this crisis, re-
fused to work with us to protect the
children; and the Senate majority lead-
er, who I am told is selling T-shirts
that describe him as the Grim Reaper,
refuses to respect the House as a co-
equal body of Congress and negotiate
the differences in our legislation.
Left in the lurch by this cruelty and
callousness are the babies and children
in government care. The House refuses
to be a party to this cruelty. That is
why we are reluctantly bringing the
Senate legislation to the floor today.
We could have done better for our
children and our families, but, unfortu-
nately, the White House and the Sen-
ate would not allow that. So we will
fight another day, and we will never
stop fighting to protect the children
who are our future.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I rise in very strong support of H.R.
3401, as amended by the Senate.
Hundreds of thousands of people have
arrived at our border this year. More
than 100,000 have crossed each of the
last 3 months, with 144,000 in May
alone. Some of these people are coming
through points of entry, but the over-
whelming majority are walking
through the desert or swimming the
Rio Grande.
Men and women across agencies and
departments have been working to-
gether night and day trying to respond
to the overwhelming surge, and they
desperately need resources to cover the
growing costs. This is a real crisis, and
this bill provides funds for all those
who are representing us and working
without adequate pay.
As I said just yesterday, we are out of
time. Some of our agencies are spend-
ing money they don’t have because
they have must-pay bills for contracts
for food, for shelter, for transportation,
and for medical care.
People are waiting in terrible condi-
tions in the desert, and summer in
Texas is here. Children are sleeping on
the ground and need to be moved to
shelters or homes. We need doctors and
pediatricians and caregivers.
This bill gives the agencies the funds
to care for these children, to reduce the
overcrowding at border facilities, to
repay the States, and to add immigra-
tion judge teams.
The Senate has already passed this
bill on an overwhelmingly bipartisan
basis. Now we should do the same and
send this bill to the President for his
signature.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong ‘‘yes’’
vote on this bill, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 466, the pre-
vious question is ordered.
The question is on the motion to con-
cur.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.
RECORDED VOTE
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I de-
mand a recorded vote.
A recorded vote was ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 15-
minute vote on the motion to concur
will be followed by a 5-minute vote on
agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of
the Journal.
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—ayes 305, noes 102,

Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent to have Represent-
ative BRIAN FITZPATRICK’s name re-

His name was added inadvertently.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

from further consideration of H.R. 962,
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Pro-
tection Act, and ask for its immediate

HONORING 2018–2019 CHAMPIONS:
HILLSIDE BASKETBALL ALL-
STARS
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, it is
my pleasure to commend the Hillside
Recreational Basketball All-Star
teams for their incredible successes
this past season.
These young athletes and their
coaches traveled all over the great
State of New Jersey to compete in the
New Jersey Basketball Association
League.
The sixth and seventh grade athletes
trained hard with their dedicated
coaches which resulted in both teams
winning 14 games. The teams then
went on to win an additional four
games during their championships. The
seventh grade team maintained their 2-
year champion streak.
These successes were accomplished
thanks to each member’s commitment
to teamwork that allowed them to
reach the height of their potential.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to say
congratulations to the Hillside Basket-
ball All-Stars.

RECOGNIZING RENA TURNER
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Representative
Rena Turner for her years of service to
North Carolina and in honor of her re-
tirement from the North Carolina Gen-
eral Assembly.
Since 2013, Representative TURNER
has been a tireless and effective advo-
cate for Iredell County in the State
legislature.
Rena has been effective as vice chair
of the Appropriations Committee and
also served on the Agriculture, Edu-
cation, and Judiciary Committees.
In my view, she has been a champion
for many economic sectors of our State
but, in particular, agriculture, which
she cared so much about.
Her constituents and I hate to see her
go, but we take comfort in knowing
that her family will get to spend some
more time with her.
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive Rena Turner for her many years of
service to Iredell County and to our
State, and I wish her nothing but the
best in her retirement.
f
WE MUST AID THE HONDURAN
PEOPLE
(Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I rise today in remembrance
of a U.S.-backed coup that, even now,
hangs as a cudgel over the people of
Honduras.
Ten years later, Hondurans still face
an erosion of human rights amid
unimagined violence, an unaccountable
government, lack of opportunity, and
increasingly militarized internal secu-
rity forces.
Just last week, in response to civil-
ian protests, President Hernandez de-
ployed the armed forces to quell his
critics, a response that not only is re-
cent, but reoccurring.
When you hear horrific accounts of
violence and lawlessness in Honduras,
it is no wonder so many seek a better
life in America.
Ten years after the coup, we must
own up to our role in the upheaval in
Honduras and come to the aid of the
people of Honduras.
f
HONORING NEBRASKA STATE
TROOPER JERRY SMITH
(Mr. SMITH of Nebraska asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life
of Nebraska State Trooper Jerry
Smith. Jerry was killed last week in a
tragic accident while on duty.
Jerry dedicated his life to serving.
First, he served our Nation in the
Army, where he won a Bronze Star.
After his retirement from the Army, he
served our great State with the Ne-
braska State Patrol.
He was highly respected in our com-
munity of Scottsbluff and Gering, Ne-
braska, and we grieve with his family.
His memorial service today was a
testament to how many lives he
touched and a tribute to his service.
People from all around the State, and
even law enforcement from out of
State, joined together to pay their re-
spects to Jerry.
He is survived by his wife, Karen,
their children, and their grandchildren.
Our hearts go out to them during this
time, and they can be assured the en-
tire State of Nebraska is with them.
We thank Jerry for his service to our
State and remember him for his service
as well.
f
GUN VIOLENCE AWARENESS
MONTH
(Mr. EVANS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I rise
to recognize Gun Violence Awareness
Month and to honor the hundreds of
thousands of survivors and victims of
gun violence.
In 2018, in my city of Philadelphia,
there were 351 homicides, and most of
these were committed with a gun.
What is happening in Philly is con-
sistent with what is happening every
day in violence-plagued Black and
Brown communities across this coun-
try. It is sickening. So is the Senate’s
lack of action on commonsense gun re-
form bills that the House has passed.
While we still need commonsense gun
reform, Senator CASEY and I have also
introduced a bill that Members from
both parties should be able to agree on,
H.R. 2585, the Resources for Victims of
Gun Violence Act.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join the 50 cosponsors and

BUILD A WALL
(Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee.
Madam Speaker, today the House
joined the Senate in approving almost
$4.6 billion in taxpayer money to ad-
dress the growing security and humani-
tarian crisis at our southern border.
We all share sympathy for the chil-
dren and individuals who find them-
selves in suffering conditions at our
southern border, but we should not
confuse that the action that the House
took today addresses the real crux of
the problem at our southern border. In-
deed, less than 5 percent of the funds
that we approved will have a realistic
impact on reducing the plague of ille-
gal immigration that faces our coun-
try.
I call upon my colleagues and I call
upon the Speaker, upon our return
after the Independence Day recess, to
take up this issue and send a clear mes-
sage around the world that this coun-
try intends to enforce its borders and
enforce its immigration laws.
Madam Speaker, I support and call
upon the Speaker to allow us to pro-
vide the funding to build a wall at our
southern border and support the Presi-
dent’s efforts to control illegal immi-
gration.
f
THE FIGHT FOR THE CHILDREN
WILL CONTINUE
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
this was a tough week for those of us
who, as mothers, have a deep pain for
the conditions of our children.
It was a difficult week because Mr.
Ramirez and his toddler died trying to
seek an opportunity in the United
States.
It was a difficult week because this
administration rejected Mr. Ramirez
from the Matamoros bridge and forced
him to cross the Rio Grande.
Today, I voted ‘‘no’’ for the $4.5 bil-
lion, moneys that I know are needed
and that passed and were provided for
those in need. If my vote was needed to
pass the bill, I would have done so.
But I am saddened by the fact that
we passed a bill that does not have the
strengthened protocols for treating the
difficulties of children and their health
needs:
It does not have the provisions deal-
ing with the quality of the treatment
of the children, the sanitation and safe-
ty;
It does not have the idea that chil-
dren can only remain in a place for 90
days;
It does not have the ability to have a
program that talks about or puts in
place how these children are treated as
relates to their healthcare and other
matters.
So, I will continue to fight because
these children’s lives are important at
the border and around the Nation, and
we will get to a point where we can
pass legislation that will treat these
children who are suffering and fleeing
in the right way.
f
WE MUST DO BETTER
(Mr. CÁRDENAS asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. CÁRDENAS. Madam Speaker,
once again, I say I am blessed to be an
American citizen and honored to be a
Member of the United States Congress.
Today is a bittersweet day for me as,
today, I was able to bring my two
grandchildren on the floor of this
House, a courtesy that we afford each
other as Members of this luscious body:
my 1-year-old granddaughter, Jimena
Luna De La Rosa, and my grandson,
Joaquin Cruz De La Rosa.
But, at the same time, we voted for
less than what we should have for the
lives of so many men, women, and chil-
dren who seek to come to the greatest
land on Earth, the United States of
America.
We must do better. We must do more.
And it is time that we push back on a
President who considers the gold
standard to be the gold on a toilet in-
stead of the gold standard that we have
come to be known for around the world
when it comes to having open arms of
welcoming good human beings to this
great country, to be part of this great
land.

CONGRATULATING THE HECTOR
GODINEZ FUNDAMENTAL HIGH
SCHOOL GIRLS SOFTBALL TEAM
(Mr. CORREA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, today
I rise to congratulate the Hector
Godinez Fundamental High School
women’s softball team on their first
ever CIF Southern Section champion-
ship victory. The team clinched their
first ever title for the school and for
Santa Ana Unified School District.
Their head coach, Ed Medina, has
been the coach since the school opened
in 2007 and was named the 2019 Orange
County Softball Coach of the Year.
His assistant coaches—Clarissa
Castellanos, Kevin Pola, and Selene
Pola—are also to be commended.
Again, I congratulate the team, the
coaches, and, of course, Principal Jesse
Church on a job well done.
Congratulations, Grizzlies.

ISSUES OF THE DAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. GOHMERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority
leader.
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, so
we just took up the humanitarian cri-
sis that is going on at our border and
passed the Senate bill, so there will be
a tremendous amount of money that
will be going to provide more beds,
shelter, food, transportation, whatever
is needed. The one thing that the Sen-
ate bill is especially void of is money
to secure our border.
It is something to say that, with all
of the problems in the Senate bill, the
things that were not addressed in the
Senate bill, the fact that it was so
much better than the House bill says
an awful lot about the House bill and
its shortcomings.
We have, still, and will after this bill
is signed into law and money is put
into use, a crisis on our southern bor-
der.
As was pointed out to me after some
of us visited Normandy with the
Speaker on the 75th anniversary of D-
Day, on D-Day, we had 150,000 or so Al-
lied troops that invaded Normandy,
over 150,000, a tremendous number,
landing craft, parachuting. Yet just in
the month of May, that is about how
many invaded our southern border—
that we caught. We don’t know how
many didn’t get caught.
Some think that for every one we ac-
tually catch and in-process, there is
one that gets away. We don’t know.
We know that there are a great num-
ber of people who are not caught be-
cause they are picked up on cameras

and with other information that is
gleaned on the border.
But it will continue to be a problem
after this money is spent, and there is
some concern—it is legitimate—that
when you have what the civil litigation
would indicate is an attractive nui-
sance—that is the terminology in a
lawsuit—and you don’t put up a fence,
a wall, something to impede people
from coming into property illegally,
then, if they hurt themselves—and the
example most people think of is a
swimming pool or a pool or a pond.
b 1745
If you have that water on your prop-
erty, and you don’t bother to put up a
fence or a wall, and someone comes
onto your property and drowns, you are
going to end up paying a tremendous
amount of money, normally, to the
family of whoever drowned coming
onto your property when it was not
properly secured with a fence or a wall.
That is not to say it has to be elec-
trified or some kind of really intense
structure. But you need to have some-
thing that would impede somebody
from coming in and drowning in your
water.
Now, the moment of silence earlier,
most of us were deeply moved by the
picture, horrendously tragic, of a child,
who seemed to be so close, even sharing
the father’s shirt, with her little arm
around his neck.
Having had girls growing up, that is
an emotional picture for some of us es-
pecially.
But we have what most would say is
the highest-evolved justice system, ju-
dicial system, litigation system in his-
tory. It has come through thousands of
years of different types of laws, be
them looking up at the bust of
Hammurabi, the Code of Hammurabi,
the Justinian Code. We have a Napole-
onic Code.
We have had thousands of years of
laws, and the civil litigation in this
country is perhaps at the most per-
fected—a long way from being perfect,
but as perfected as it has ever been
anywhere.
That is where this concept of attrac-
tive nuisance has evolved and arisen
from. There is a responsibility when
you know there is something so attrac-
tive that people will be tempted to
break the law and enter that property
illegally, potentially, to their own det-
riment.
What are you supposed to do if you
are a caring individual in charge of
property? You put up a fence or wall,
just like our former President Obama
did.
I understand he built a 10-foot wall
around his home. That is a good, re-
sponsible thing to do. It was good
enough for the President when he was
in the White House to raise the height
of the fence and wall around the White
House, and it is good enough for the
former President as he built a wall
around his private residence.
It is a good, responsible thing to do
by a responsible person in charge of
property, not only to provide privacy,
but also to keep people from being
lured to their own detriment.
It is high time we address that on our
southern border. There are very few
people in this body, on either side of
the aisle, who have not at some point
said that we need to secure our border,
that we can’t keep having people pour
into this country illegally.
But something strange has happened
as our friends have taken over the ma-
jority and Republicans have moved
into the minority. Some people have
realized: Wait a minute. If these people
keep flooding into our country from
other countries illegally, and they see
us as the party that keeps the border
porous and open for them to keep pour-
ing in, they will surely reward us with
their votes, so we will be able to de-
velop a permanent majority.
The only trouble with that is that
when that happens, we are destroying
the goose that had been laying golden
eggs of opportunity, freedom, incred-
ible liberty like the world had never
seen before, the United States of Amer-
ica and our Constitution, followed with
the Bill of Rights.
Yes, it has taken a while to get them
continuing to evolve toward greater
perfection. But we have to do some-
thing, because if we don’t, if we con-
tinue to have people pouring into the
United States—when you look at the
example of Normandy with 150,000 or
so, we had that many illegally invading
America in 1 month.
We have to do something because the
people pouring in have not been edu-
cated on the responsibilities of main-
taining self-government. They will end
up forcing this country—not inten-
tionally but because they do not under-
stand the responsibility involved in
continuing this little experiment in
self-government that has lasted 230
years. They will unintentionally give
way to either communism or progres-
sivism, if you prefer that these days, or
a pure dictatorship.
It is very disconcerting that, in this
country, there is more and more rising
emotion between different political
thought.
Look at the difference between the
American Revolution, the 8 years that
it took to win our independence, 1775 to
1783, and toward the end of the year
when the Treaty of Paris was signed. It
started, ‘‘In the Name of the Most Holy
and Undivided Trinity.’’ The British
signed that. They thought that would
be an oath that they would have to
take so seriously in England that they
would not breach that oath taken in
the name of the ‘‘Most Holy and Undi-
vided Trinity.’’
Historians know, normally, a govern-
ment doesn’t last more than 200 years,
and they are lucky if they last 200
years. We have gone 230.
People look at the 10 years of the
French Revolution, from about 1789,
when our Constitution was ratified and
when the Bastille was stormed, to 1799.
What was the result of the French Rev-
olution? It was an Emperor named Na-
poleon.
Some historians say that they think
the big difference between the U.S.
Revolution resulting in liberty and the
French Revolution resulting in hun-
dreds of thousands of heads being cut
off was our Revolution was about lib-
erty.
The Founding Fathers were not out
there to cut off heads. They were out
there to grab and preserve liberty,
whereas in the French Revolution,
there was so much sentiment of getting
revenge that it ended up culminating
in an Emperor named Napoleon.
We now seem to have so much ani-
mus and so much anger. There is some,
from time to time, in this body. But
some of the most vocal people pushing
for impeachment, like my friend AL
GREEN, he, literally, is a friend. He is a
Christian brother. I disagree with him
strongly on the need for impeachment,
but I like the guy. He is my brother. I
know he would not be saying what he
does unless he really believes it.
I would never wish harm on some-
body that I cared about like that. We
can disagree without being mean. Yet,
too often now, that is being lost.
We have to preserve this place. We
are about to recognize our anniversary,
the Fourth of July, when the Declara-
tion of Independence was made public.
This needs to be a time of serious re-
flection.
It ought to include John Adams’ en-
couragement to celebrate, have pa-
rades, enjoy families, enjoy the coun-
try. Of course, he says the firing of
guns. We try not to do that. Instead,
they use fireworks.
He knew there ought to be a celebra-
tion to remind us of the sacrifice, what
was gained through that great sac-
rifice, and the responsibility that en-
sued, along with the liberty.
We should also remember the way
they got to the Constitution was when
Randolph, from Virginia, proposed
that, after 5 weeks of yelling and fuss-
ing, that even though they didn’t have
money to hire a chaplain, why don’t
they take a few days off and gather to-
gether, on our Nation’s Independence
Day, at a local church there in Phila-
delphia. They ended up settling on the
Reformed Calvinist Church, with the
Right Reverend William Rogers pre-
siding, and they worshipped God to-
gether. They were led in prayer by Rev-
erend Rogers. They came back after
that and gave us the most extraor-
dinary founding document in the his-
tory of the world that we still use 232
years later. It was a time of reflection.
Unless we secure our border though,
we will not be a shining light on a hill.
We will be a transit station for people
around the world to pass through, hop-
ing for something great but, instead,
only seeing a once-great country whose
experiment in self-government was de-
stroyed by too many people coming in
too quickly, who did not know, as they
hadn’t been educated, how to go about
preserving self-government.

The Senate met at 9:30 a.m. and was

tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).
f
PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Eternal Lord, the center of our joy,
we come to You, drawn by Your uncon-
ditional love. Lord, give us reverential
awe as You open our eyes to see Your
power and majesty.
Help our lawmakers become aware of
Your presence, giving them Your peace
and illuminating their paths. May they
rejoice because You are their refuge.
Lord, bless their families, surrounding
them with the shield of Your favor.
Draw our Senators close to You and to
one another in humility and service.
And, Lord, we thank You for the
faithfulness of the 2019 U.S. Senate
summer pages as they prepare to leave
us. We pray that You would bless and
keep them. Amen.

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak for 90 sec-
onds as in morning business.

f
ALZHEIMER’S AND BRAIN
AWARENESS MONTH
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, June
is Alzheimer’s and Brain Awareness
Month.
It is important to recognize the im-
pact Alzheimer’s has on families in
Iowa and across the country and to rec-
ognize the cost to taxpayers because of
the care it takes in the last years of
their lives. This disease robs Ameri-
cans of their memories and impacts
their ability to speak, pay attention,
and exercise judgment.
The best way for Congress to help
with Alzheimer’s disease is to ensure
adequate research funding to find
treatments. As Congress considers ap-
propriations for next year, we should
continue to fund research and work to-
ward curing this disease.
f
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on
another point, the Supreme Court
made a decision this week that I very
much disagree with. I am an advocate
for the Freedom of Information Act
and for the public’s business being pub-
lic, and this Supreme Court decision
inhibited that.
In a self-governed society, the people
ought to know what their government
is up to. Transparency laws, like the
Freedom of Information Act, help to
provide access to information in the
face of an opaque and obstinate govern-
ment. Unfortunately, a recent Supreme
Court ruling and new regulations at
the EPA and the Department of the In-
terior are undermining access to there
being public information.
In other words, the public’s business
ought to be public. So I am working on
legislation to address these develop-
ments and to promote access to gov-
ernment records. Americans deserve an
accountable government, and trans-
parency leads to accountability.
f
TRIBUTE TO NICK NURSE
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on a
little lighter note, I am proud to say
that the NBA season concluded with a
University of Northern Iowa graduate’s
being able to call himself a champion.
The Toronto Raptors’ head coach,
Nick Nurse, graduated from my alma
mater. He played for the University of
Northern Iowa Panthers from 1985 to
1989. Nick went on to coach numerous
teams, including for Grand View Uni-
versity in Des Moines. Nick knows how
to reignite hometown pride. He led the
first and only boys’ Class 3–A cham-
pionship for Kuemper Catholic High
School in Carroll, IA. He is a class act.
Congratulations to Nick.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.

BORDER SECURITY
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, 8
weeks ago, the administration sent
Congress an urgent request for humani-
tarian money for the border. For 8
weeks, we have seen evidence nearly
every day that the conditions have
been getting worse. Yet, during all of
this time, our Democratic House col-
leagues have been unable to produce a
clean measure to provide this humani-
tarian funding with its having any
chance of becoming law.
The proposal they finally passed this
week was way to the left of the main-
stream. The President made it clear it
would earn a veto, not a signature.
Even so, in an abundance of fairness,
the Senate voted on Speaker PELOSI’s
effort—poison pill riders and all. It
earned just 37 votes. The House pro-
posal earned 37 votes here. Fortu-
nately, we do have a chance to make

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4588 June 27, 2019
law this week on a hugely bipartisan
basis.
The Senate advanced a clean, simple
humanitarian funding bill yesterday by
a huge margin. Thanks to Chairman
SHELBY and Senator LEAHY, this bipar-
tisan package sailed through the Ap-
propriations Committee 30 to 1, and it
passed the full Senate yesterday—now
listen to this—84 to 8. We sent that
clean bill over to the House by a vote
of 84 to 8. The Shelby-Leahy legislation
has unified the Appropriations Com-
mittee, and it has unified the Senate.
The administration would sign it into
law.
So all that our House colleagues need
to do to help the men, women, and chil-
dren on the border this week is to pass
this unifying bipartisan bill and send it
to the President. For weeks, we have
heard our House Democratic colleagues
speaking a lot about the poor condi-
tions, the overstretched facilities, the
insufficient supplies. Our bill gives
them the chance today to actually do
something about it.
Now, I understand that instead of
moving forward with this bipartisan
bill, the Speaker is signaling she may
choose to drag out the process even
more and might persist in some variety
of the leftwing demands that caused
the House bill to fail dramatically in
the Senate yesterday. I understand
that some of the further changes the
House Democrats are discussing may
be unobjectionable things the Trump
administration may be able to help to
secure for them administratively.
Yet it is crystal clear that some of
these new demands would drag this bi-
partisan bill way back to the left and
jeopardize the Shelby-Leahy consensus
product that unified the Senate and
that is so close to becoming law—this
close.
For example, I understand that the
House Democrats may ask the Speaker
to insist on—listen to this—cutting the
supplemental funding for Immigration
and Customs Enforcement and the De-
partment of Defense. In the middle of
this historic surge on the border, they
want to claw back some of this badly
needed money from the men and
women who are down there on the
frontlines. It looks like these cuts
would represent pay cuts to ICE staff,
including pay that people have already
earned, and cuts to the money for in-
vestigating child trafficking.
Chairman SHELBY and Senator LEAHY
have already reached a bipartisan
agreement. Both sides have already
compromised. We are standing at the 5-
yard line. Yet, apparently, some in the
House want to dig back into that
‘‘abolish ICE’’ playbook and throw a
far-left partisan wrench into the whole
thing.
Let me be perfectly clear. I am glad
the Speaker and the administration are
discussing some of these outstanding
issues, but if the House Democrats send
the Senate back some partisan effort
to disrupt our bipartisan progress, we
will simply move to table it. The U.S.
Senate is not going to pass a border
funding bill that will cut the money for
ICE and the Department of Defense. It
is not going to happen. We already
have our compromise. The Shelby-
Leahy Senate bill is the only game in
town. It is time to quit playing games.
It is time to make it law.
I urge my colleagues across the Cap-
itol to take up the clean, bipartisan
bill that the Senate passed 84 to 8 and,
without any more unnecessary delays,
send it on to President Trump for his
signature.
f
TOBACCO-FREE YOUTH ACT
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on
another matter, just last month, I in-
troduced legislation, along with my
colleague from Virginia, Senator
KAINE, to address a serious and growing
public health issue. As Senator KAINE
and I laid out in May, the growing pop-
ularity and accessibility of tobacco
products like e-cigarettes and vapor
products are endangering America’s
youth.
The CDC estimates that in 2018 youth
e-cigarette use in America increased by
1.5 million. So we introduced legisla-
tion that would accomplish something
very important—raising the minimum
age for purchasing tobacco and vapor
products to 21 nationwide. We want to
put a huge dent in these pathways to
childhood addiction and help get these
products out of high schools alto-
gether.
Now, as a Virginian and a Ken-
tuckian, neither Senator KAINE nor I
lack an appreciation for the history of
tobacco in America. For generations,
this hugely important cash crop helped
to build our States and, indeed, the
whole Nation’s early prosperity. Yet
new doors are open today to Ken-
tucky’s growers and producers, and
parents back home are rightly worried
that e-cigarettes and vapor products
pose new threats to the young people
at a critical stage in their develop-
ments.
So I was proud to take the lead on
this, and I am proud my colleague from
Virginia has joined me in leading this
effort to give this cause the strong bi-
partisan momentum it richly deserves.
Our measure cleared an important
milestone yesterday. The HELP Com-
mittee approved our Tobacco-Free
Youth Act and advanced it here, to the
floor, along with other legislation.
I thank Chairman ALEXANDER, Rank-
ing Member MURRAY, and all of our col-
leagues on the committee for including
our legislation in this package and ad-
vancing it. I look forward to con-
tinuing to work with them, with Sen-
ator KAINE, and with all of our col-
leagues as we work to get this impor-
tant proposal signed into law.
f
NATIONAL DEFENSE
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on
another matter entirely, later today,
the Senate will vote to fulfill a solemn
responsibility. For the 59th consecutive
year, we will pass the National Defense
Authorization Act. I hope and expect
we will do it by a wide, bipartisan mar-
gin.
It would be difficult to overstate the
importance of this legislation to the
ongoing missions of our Nation’s men
and women in uniform. The NDAA is
simultaneously a target to guide the
modernization of our all-volunteer
force; a supply line to restore readiness
and keep U.S. personnel equipped with
the most cutting-edge, lethal capabili-
ties; a promise of critical support serv-
ices to military families; and a declara-
tion to both our allies and adversaries
of America’s strategic resolve.
This year’s bill authorizes the invest-
ments that will support all these bills
and a major pay raise for military per-
sonnel to boot.
I am especially proud that it sup-
ports the ongoing missions of Ken-
tucky’s installations and the many
military families who call my State
home.
The NDAA is a product of a robust,
bipartisan process that has consumed
our colleagues on the Armed Services
Committee for weeks. Nearly 300
amendments were adopted during
markup. So today, once again, I would
like to thank Chairman INHOFE and
Ranking Member REED for their leader-
ship throughout this process. They pro-
duced legislation that each Member of
this body should be proud of. Particu-
larly in these troubled times, this is
exactly—exactly—the message the
Senate needs to send. I look forward to
passing it today.
Passing the NDAA itself is not the
only important message the Senate
will send this week on national secu-
rity. On Friday morning, we will vote
on a badly ill-conceived amendment
that would literally make our Nation
less secure and make American serv-
icemembers less safe. I respect my col-
leagues, but this amendment from Sen-
ator UDALL and others is a half-baked
and dangerous measure—about as half-
baked and dangerous as we have seen
on the floor in quite some time. It
should be soundly rejected.
We know that our Democratic col-
leagues have political differences with
President Trump—I think the whole
country has gotten that message pret-
ty loud and clear—but they have cho-
sen a terrible time and a completely ir-
responsible manner to express them-
selves. Rather than work with the
President, who shares the goal of
avoiding war with Iran, they have gra-
tuitously chosen to make him the
enemy.
Let me repeat that. Rather than
work with the President to deter our
actual enemies, they have chosen to
make him the enemy.
At the very moment that Iran has
been stepping up its aggression
throughout the Middle East, these Sen-
ators are proposing radical new restric-
tions on the administration’s ability to
defend U.S. interests and our partners.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4589
June 27, 2019
The Udall amendment would require
the administration to secure explicit
authorization from Congress before our
forces would be able to respond to all
kinds of potential Iranian attacks.
That would include attacks on Amer-
ican civilians.
Let me say that again. Some of our
colleagues want us to go out of our way
and create a brandnew obstacle that
would block the President from swiftly
responding if Iran attacks American ci-
vilians, our U.S. diplomatic facilities,
or Israel, or the military forces of an
ally or partner, or if Iran closes the
Strait of Hormuz. In all of these sce-
narios, the Udall amendment would
hamstring the executive branch from
reacting quickly. In modern warfare,
time is of the essence. The War Powers
Resolution explicitly recognizes the re-
ality that administrations may need to
respond quickly and with flexibility.
This amendment could even con-
strain our military from acting to pre-
vent an imminent attack. As written,
it appears to suggest they must absorb
the attack, take the attack first before
defending themselves. And even then,
for how long would they be allowed to
conduct retaliatory strikes? Com-
pletely absurd. Totally dangerous.
Let’s take an example. Iran attacks
Israel. No timely response from the
United States, especially if Congress
happens to be on recess. Iran attacks
American citizens. The President’s
hands would be tied. This is never how
the American Presidency has worked,
for a very good reason.
So I would ask my colleagues to stop
obsessing about Donald Trump for a
moment and think about a scenario in-
volving a future or past President. Hy-
pothetically, then, would it be appro-
priate for Congress to tie a President’s
hands with legislation preventing mili-
tary action to defend NATO allies from
a Russian attack without explicit con-
gressional approval? If conflict came in
August and the United States and its
NATO allies didn’t act decisively,
frontline states could be gobbled up be-
fore Congress could even convene to
consider an AUMF.
The Udall amendment would rep-
resent a huge departure from the basic
flexibility that Presidents in both par-
ties have always had to take imme-
diate military steps, short of a full-
scale war, to respond to immediate cri-
ses.
This ploy is being advertised as some
kind of courageous reassertion by Con-
gress of our constitutional authority,
but it is nothing of the sort. It is a de-
parture from our constitutional tradi-
tions and norms.
Nobody is talking about a full-scale
war with Iran—not the President; not
the administration. Heaven forbid, if
that situation were to arrive, consulta-
tion with Congress and widespread pub-
lic support would, of course, be nec-
essary. The Udall amendment is some-
thing completely different. It defines
self-defense in a laughably narrow way
and then in all other situations pro-
poses that President Trump should be
stripped of the basic powers of his of-
fice unless Democrats in Congress
write him a permission slip. I don’t
think so.
This would be a terrible idea at any
moment, let alone as Iran is escalating
its violence and searching for any sign
of American weakness.
So I would ask my colleagues: Do not
embolden Iran. Do not weaken our de-
terrence. Do not undermine our diplo-
macy. Do not tie the hands of our mili-
tary commanders. Reject this dan-
gerous mistake when we vote on the
Udall amendment tomorrow.

UDALL, KAINE, MERKLEY, MURPHY,
PAUL, and LEE, to accommodate all
Senators who wish to vote. That is why
we are doing it tomorrow. If the Udall
amendment is passed, it would be
adopted to the Defense authorization
bill even though the vote occurs after-
ward.
I want to thank the leader for under-
standing our position that the Senate
ought to vote on this important
amendment, which in essence would
prohibit funds for hostilities with Iran
without an affirmative authorization
from Congress. Congress gets to ap-
prove or disapprove wars, period. It is
crucial for the Senate and Congress as
a whole to examine potential conflicts
and to exercise our authority in mat-
ters of war and peace.
Let’s start with the facts. Ever since
President Trump withdrew from the
Iran nuclear deal, our two countries
have been on a path toward conflict.
For the past month, we have been
locked in a cycle of escalating tensions
with Iran. Iran attacked a tanker in
the Gulf region and shot down a U.S.
surveillance drone. The U.S. Govern-
ment has responded to both provo-
cations, and the President reportedly
considered and then pulled back on a
military strike.
The American people are worried—
and rightly so—that even if the Presi-
dent isn’t eager for war, he may bum-
ble us into one. Small provocations in
the Middle East can often spin out of
control. Our country has learned that
the hard way. When the President is
surrounded by hawkish advisers like
John Bolton and Secretary Pompeo,
the danger is even more acute.
So while the majority leader says
that ‘‘no one is talking about war,’’
that is only true until the folks do
start talking about war, and by then,
the chance to clarify that this Presi-
dent requires congressional authoriza-
tion before engaging in major hos-
tilities may have passed us by.
And this not talking about war?
Well, the President said he was 10 min-
utes away from major provocation, if
the reports are correct. It would have
been on Iranian soil, three missile
bases. And the President at one point
said, in effect: We will smash Iran,
blow it to smithereens—or something
to that effect. People are talking about
war. This President is.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4590 June 27, 2019
Even though it is plainly written in
the Constitution that the legislature
alone, not the Executive, has the power
to declare war, the Trump administra-
tion is already signaling that it doesn’t
need Congress. The President and his
team are playing up links between al-
Qaida and Iran, potentially setting the
stage for them to claim legal authority
under the sweeping 2001 authorization
of military force to strike Iran without
congressional approval.
The President himself, asked if he be-
lieves he has the authority to initiate
military action against Iran without
first going to Congress, replied, ‘‘I do.’’
He continued, ‘‘I do like keeping Con-
gress abreast, but I don’t have to do it
legally.’’
So when it comes to a potential war
with Iran, Mr. President Trump, yes,
you do. You do. You do.
The Founding Fathers—our greatest
wisdom in this country—worried about
housing war powers in the executive
branch for precisely this reason.
As James Madison wrote to Jeffer-
son, who was not there when they were
writing the Constitution—he was pleni-
potentiary to France—here is what
Madison wrote to Jefferson:
The constitution supposes, what the His-
tory of all Governments demonstrates, that
the Executive is the branch of power most
interested in war, and most prone to it. It
has accordingly, with studied care, vested
the question of war to the Legislature.
That is Madison, who put more into
this Constitution than anyone else.
Let me read it again. It is clear as a
bell. Madison wrote to Jefferson:
The constitution supposes, what the His-
tory of all Governments demonstrates, that
the Executive is the branch of power most
interested in war, and most prone to it. It
has accordingly, with studied care, vested
the question of war to the Legislature.
there were ever a President who fits
that description, it is Donald Trump.
The Framers worried about an over-
reaching Executive waging unilateral
war. My colleagues know well that we
haven’t had an overreaching Executive
like the one we have now for quite
some time, if ever. So if it comes to it,
we should expect the President to chal-
lenge Congress’s war powers. He has
basically already told us that he would.
So my colleagues should vote to
strengthen our ability to oversee this
President’s strategy with Iran. That is
what the bipartisan Udall amendment
would do—nothing more. There has
been some fearmongering about how
the amendment might tie the hands of
our military. It would not. It is explic-
itly written that in no way should it be
construed to prevent the U.S. military
from responding to an act of aggression
or from acting in self-defense.
It is high time that Congress reestab-
lish itself as this Nation’s decider of
war and peace. We have been content
too long to let the Executive take all
of the initiatives and responsibility for
military action abroad. The American
people are weary of the endless con-
flicts in the Middle East and the loss of
American lives and American treasure.
The Udall amendment would mark
the beginning of Congress reasserting
its constitutional powers. I strongly
urge my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle to vote yes tomorrow.
G20 ECONOMIC SUMMIT
Mr. President, President Trump has
arrived at the G20 economic summit in
Japan before traveling for a state visit
in South Korea. Already, the President
has managed to insult our long-
standing allies, including Germany and
Japan, the host nation.
Rather than undermining our alli-
ances, here are two important things
the President should do at the G20:
First, Russia and Vladimir Putin.
When President Trump sits down with
the Russian President, he must send an
unmistakable warning that the United
States will not tolerate foreign inter-
ference in our elections in 2020. Presi-
dent Trump has no excuse. The Mueller
report, FBI Director Wray, virtually
our entire intelligence community con-
cluded that Russia was guilty of inter-
fering in our elections and that 2020
would be the next big show.
President Trump has a responsibility
to defend the United States. By di-
rectly challenging Putin, he will send a
signal not merely to Putin but to all of
our adversaries that interfering with
our election is unacceptable and that
they will pay a price—a strong price—
for trying.
Second, China and President Xi. Now
that trade negotiations between our
countries seemed to have stalled, there
is a chance to put them back on track.
For that to happen, the President must
remain strong. He cannot go soft now
and accept a bad deal that falls short of
reforming China’s rapacious economic
policies—cyber espionage, forced tech-
nology transfers, state-sponsorship,
and, worst of all, denial of market ac-
cess.
President Trump, you know it. We
have talked about it. You have a once-
in-a-generation opportunity to reform
China’s economic relations with the
world and put American businesses and
American workers on a level playing
field. Stay tough. Don’t give in. Make
sure Huawei cannot come to the United
States and we cannot supply it. Enough
with the criticism for our allies. Aim it
at our adversaries, China and Russia,
and you will have a much better
chance of making the G20 a success for
American interests.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Arkan-
sas is recognized.
S. 1790
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, to-
morrow morning the Senate will vote
on whether to disarm our troops as
they face a growing campaign of Ira-
nian aggression in the Middle East. To-
morrow morning the Senate will vote
on whether to empower the Ayatollahs
as they continue to rampage across the
Middle East, attacking U.S. aircraft,
attacking ships in the high seas,
threatening our troops in Iraq, Syria,
Afghanistan, Bahrain, Qatar, and else-
where. That is because we will be vot-
ing tomorrow morning on an amend-
ment that says, very simply: ‘‘No funds
may be used to conduct hostilities
against the Government of Iran,
against the Armed Forces of Iran, or in
the territory of Iran, except pursuant
to an Act or a joint resolution of Con-
gress specifically authorizing such hos-
tilities.’’
That amendment is simple—I would
say simple-minded—but it is simply an
act of appeasement against the Aya-
tollahs who are currently conducting
attacks against the United States and
our interests on a regular and growing
basis.
Let’s just take a case in point. The
earlier version of this amendment in-
cluded no exception—no exception
whatsoever—for our troops to defend
themselves against an attack by Iran.
You might say that is a careless omis-
sion. I would, however, say that even
the fact that it was changed after I
pointed out that omission just goes to
show you that the root of this amend-
ment is Trump derangement syndrome.
It does have an exception now. Let’s
look at that: ‘‘Nothing can be con-
strued to restrict the use of the United
States Armed Forces to defend’’—to de-
fend—‘‘against an attack upon the
United States, its territories or posses-
sions, or its Armed Forces.’’
What does that mean? What does it
mean to defend against an attack? I
don’t know. I am not sure. If an F–15
pilot is shot upon in international air-
space, I guess he can deploy counter-
measures—chaff—to disrupt the mis-
sile. Can he shoot back? Can he shoot
back at the Iranian missile battery
that shot at him?
Let’s say our troops who are garri-
soned in places like Iraq and Syria
have incoming mortar fire by an Ira-
nian proxy militia. I guess they can
duck and cover in a concrete bunker. I
guess that is defense. Can they use
counterbattery fire to shoot back at
that mortar firing position? I don’t
know. I don’t know. Can they? Beats
me.
We have thousands of troops sta-
tioned at Al Udeid Air Base, the main
airbase from which we conducted oper-
ations against the Islamic State. Let’s
say they have a missile coming in. I
guess they can use a patriot missile de-
fense system to shoot that missile
down. Can they fire back at the missile
battery that shot that missile, which
has many more to fire? I don’t know.
Can they? It seems like offense to me.
Maybe it is defense.
Let’s take a page from history. In
1988, Ronald Reagan authorized one of
the largest naval engagements since
World War II in response to the exact
kinds of attacks against commercial
shipping and the U.S. Navy on the high
seas that we have seen from Iran in the
last 2 weeks. However, that operation
didn’t commence for 4 days; it was 4
days after a U.S. Navy frigate hit one
of the Iranian mines before we struck

back. Is that in defense against an Ira-
nian attack? It doesn’t seem that it
would be, to me. I don’t know.
What we are debating here is how
many lawyers can dance on a head of a
pin when our soldiers are in harm’s
way. They need to know that when
they are shot upon, they can fire back,
and they can eliminate that threat
without any politician in Washington
or any lawyer at the Department of De-
fense looking over their shoulders and
second-guessing them. That is not
what they get from this amendment,
though.
Consider also the consequences.
Many of the speakers today will say
this is about deescalating tension in
the Middle East—deescalating. Who is
escalating it? Who is the one firing on
American aircraft? Not Donald Trump.
Who is interfering with the freedom of
navigation on the high seas? It is not
Donald Trump; it is the Ayatollahs.
They are the ones who have manufac-
tured this crisis because they know
that the United States is on the stra-
tegic offensive and that we have the
initiative against Iran for the first
time in 40 years.
This amendment, though, would only
embolden them to continue the cam-
paign of the last 2 months of gradually
marching up the escalatory ladder. It
started with threats. Then it was an at-
tack on foreign vessels at port. Then it
was an attack on foreign vessels on the
high seas. Then it was an attack on an
unmanned American aircraft. Next it
might be an attack on a manned Amer-
ican aircraft or a U.S. ship. And the
message we are going to send is this:
Well, the Congress thinks that the
Commander in Chief and, for that mat-
ter, battalion commanders on the
ground don’t have the authority and
the flexibility they need to take the
appropriate response, as opposed to
cowering inside bunkers and using
some defensive measures.
Let’s also think about the language
of this amendment. A lot of people are
going to come here and say that this is
about our constitutional authority,
and we need to reclaim our authority,
and we have given up too much author-
ity to the executive branch. In a lot of
instances I would agree with that. But
this amendment is only about Iran. It
is not about China; it is not about Rus-
sia—even though this President has
forced our Democratic friends to fi-
nally discover their inner cold warrior.
This is only about Iran in the context
of Iran shooting down an American air-
craft just a week ago. What better mes-
sage can you send that this is not
about our constitutional authority?
This is about trying to tie the hands of
a Commander in Chief whom they dis-
like at a time when a foreign nation is
targeting our aircraft and our service-
members.
This amendment would be a loud and
clear message to the Ayatollahs that
we will not strike back, that they can
escalate even further, and that there
will not be swift reprisal. If there is, it
will generate intense controversy in
our country. It will only embolden
them further to march up that
escalatory ladder and threaten Amer-
ican lives. It is a hall pass for Iranian
escalation, really.
Look, there is no amendment, no bill,
no paper resolution that can change
the iron laws of geopolitics. Strength
deters and weakness provokes. Wars
are not won by paper resolutions. They
are won by iron resolution. But this
amendment embodies irresolution,
weakness, timidity, diffidence.
This Congress on a good day can re-
name a post office, and that is only
after months and months of debate
about the post office. Are you telling
me—are you telling me that if Iran
shoots down an American aircraft or
continues attacks on partners like the
United Arab Emirates, then this Con-
gress in a matter of minutes and hours
is going to pass a resolution author-
izing the use of force to respond to that
kind of provocation? Please.
There is a reason we have one Com-
mander in Chief, not 535 commanders
in chief—or, I say again, 535 battalion
commanders, the level at which some
of these decisions ought to be made.
Think about the kind of debates we
have, the know-nothings we have seen
here in Washington over the last cou-
ple of weeks who would say: Oh, it
wasn’t Iran that made the attack. OK,
it was Iran, but maybe it wasn’t au-
thorized by the senior leadership of
Iran. OK, it was authorized, but it
didn’t really do that much damage. It
is kind of like the old line of: It is not
my dog. He didn’t bite you. You kicked
him first. That is what that debate
would devolve into while our troops are
at risk.
This is a terrible amendment. It will
do nothing but put more American
lives at risk and imperil our interests
and our partners throughout the re-
gion.
I know that the minority leader said
earlier that he is worried about the
President bumbling into war. He said it
last week on TV too. Nations don’t
bumble into war.
He and others have raised the pros-
pect of endless wars, the wars we have
been fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.
They are long, and we have made lots
of twists and turns on the way. But
let’s not forget that many of the Demo-
crats in this Chamber voted to author-
ize those wars. We didn’t bumble into
those. They were considered, deliberate
decisions.
President Trump said just a couple
days ago that he is not talking about
that kind of operation. He is talking
about the exact kind of thing that Ron-
ald Reagan did in response to Iranian
aggression on the high seas. That
didn’t start a war. Ronald Reagan
didn’t start a war when he retaliated
against Libya for acts of terrorism
against our troops in 1986. Donald
Trump didn’t start a war when he
struck Syria in 2017 and 2018 for gas-
sing its own people. If you want a
Democratic example, Bill Clinton
didn’t start a war when he struck Iraq
in 1993 and 1998.
This amendment purports to tie the
hands of the Commander in Chief rel-
ative only to a single nation, which
just so happens to be the nation that
just shot down an American aircraft.
The only result that will come of this
amendment passing will be to em-
bolden the Ayatollahs and make more
likely that which its proponents wish
to avoid.
I urge all of my colleagues to see the
reality of this amendment and to vote
no tomorrow morning.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia.
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise
to speak in favor of the Udall amend-
ment, a bipartisan amendment. I am a
proud Virginian. The Commonwealth of
Virginia is more connected to the Na-
tion’s military service by our map, by
the installations in Virginia, and by
personnel than any other State, and I
am the proud father of a U.S. marine.
I love serving with my colleagues on
the Foreign Relations and Armed Serv-
ices Committees.
Tomorrow we are going to vote on a
question that cannot be more funda-
mental: Can President Trump take us
to war with Iran without coming to
Congress for authorization? That is the
question. Can President Trump take us
to war with Iran without coming to
Congress for authorization? This is a
matter of the utmost importance for
this body, for the American public, and
for our troops. Americans, especially
those who have family serving in the
military—and many of those families
have seen their loved ones deployed
multiple times since 2001—want to
know what each Senator thinks about
this important question.
The Udall amendment to the NDAA,
which has bipartisan sponsorship, is
very simple. It states that no funds
will be expended in a war with Iran or
on Iranian soil, except in self-defense,
unless Congress takes the affirmative
step of specifically authorizing those
hostilities.
My colleague from Arkansas talked
about lawyers dancing on the head of a
pin, as he tried to suggest that ‘‘self-
defense’’ was not a clearly defined
term. I think most of my colleagues
who read the language will believe it is
incredibly clear; the President has the
power to defend the Nation from an im-
minent attack or ongoing attack with-
out asking anyone for permission. That
is specifically stated in our resolution.
There is no confusion about it. There is
no attempt to limit a President’s
power to defend the Nation, but if the
President decides that we need to go on
an offensive war against a sovereign
country, this amendment would sug-
gest he could not do so unless he came
to Congress.
Those voting for this amendment will
say clearly that no war should be start-
ed unless Congress votes for it. Those

opposing the amendment will say
clearly that it is OK for the President
to go to war against Iran whenever and
for whatever reason on his own.
Those who vote against this amend-
ment, in my view, are essentially giv-
ing the President a green light to wage
war anywhere, against anyone, on his
own. That is not a power we should
give to this President or any President.
I believe, in my 61⁄2 years in the Senate,
there has only been one vote as serious
as the vote we will cast tomorrow
morning.
Why do I believe war should not be
started without a vote of Congress?
The Democratic leader outlined the
clear constitutional history in this re-
gard. It is Congress that declares war.
The history and context of that provi-
sion in article I is very plain. At that
time in the world, in 1787, war was for
the Executive. It was for the King, the
Emperor, the Monarch, the Sultan, the
Pope, but the drafters of the American
Constitution wanted to dramatically
change history in this Nation and say
that war for the United States of
America should be a matter not for the
Executive to declare but, instead, for
the peoples’ elected legislative body to
declare.
Once declared, the President, as Com-
mander in Chief, needs to be that com-
mander. I agree with my colleague
from Arkansas. You don’t need 535
commanders, but it is not up to the
President to initiate or declare war,
constitutionally; it is clearly up to
Congress.
The reason we should vote for this
isn’t just because of the constitutional
provision. It is the value that underlies
the constitutional provision. Why did
the Framers put the question of war as
a matter for the legislature? A congres-
sional debate and vote is what is nec-
essary for the American public and
Congress to fully understand the
stakes, to explain to the public and
educate them why war is necessary—
and especially, and most importantly,
the debate and the vote by the legisla-
tive body is the evidence of support for
the mission that American troops de-
serve if they are going to be sent into
harm’s way where they could be killed
or injured or see their friends killed or
injured.
I believe it is the height of public im-
morality. There could be nothing more
immoral in the public space than to
order our troops into harm’s way,
where they would risk injury and death
if Congress is unwilling to consider and
debate and vote on whether a war is in
the national interest.
You have to go risk your life, you
have to go be with others and poten-
tially be injured or killed, but we don’t
want to have to vote on it. Could any-
thing be more immoral than that?
What this provision does is say that if
we are going to be at war with Iran
and, by example, with any nation, Con-
gress should have the guts and back-
bone to come and cast a vote before we
order our troops into harm’s way.
Why is this debate important right
now? We are in the middle of discussing
the National Defense Authorizing Act,
but I also want to point out two very
important things, one an event and one
a statement that may have occurred in
the last week, since many of us took
the floor last Wednesday.
On Thursday, a week ago today,
President Trump ordered and then
called off a missile strike against Ira-
nian territory that would have been
the start of a shooting war with Iran.
It was a missile strike in the sovereign
nation of Iran. Our military and all
reasonable people understood that
would have been responded to. So we
were within 10 minutes. President
Trump says he called off the strike on
Iran with 10 minutes to spare.
We were within 10 minutes a week
ago of being in a war.
The second thing that happened is, a
few days ago, the President gave an ex-
clusive interview to The Hill saying: ‘‘I
do not need congressional approval to
strike Iran.’’
Congress is irrelevant. I don’t need to
come to Congress.
The quote that the Democratic lead-
er mentioned a few minutes earlier was
that the President said: It is good to
keep them abreast of the situation, but
I am not legally required to do so.
How insulting for the President, who
pledged at his inauguration to defend
and support the Constitution, to not
recognize that the article I branch—
and we are the article I branch for a
reason—must not be just consulted
with but be on board with any wars ex-
pressed by their vote.
This President is holding the article
I branch in contempt. Will we grovel
and accept that monumental disrespect
or will we insist that the President
must follow the law?
For the record, I believe a war with
Iran would be a colossal mistake. Its
cause would be laid significantly at our
feet by the United States and the
Trump administration tearing up a dip-
lomatic deal, tearing it up over the ob-
jections or over the recommendations
of the then-Secretary of State, Sec-
retary of Defense, National Security
Advisor, Joint Chiefs of Staff, tearing
it up over the recommendations of our
allies, tearing it up over the rec-
ommendations of the International
Atomic Energy Agency. We tore up a
diplomatic deal and raised the risk of
an unnecessary war; that would be cat-
astrophic.
After 18 years of two wars in the Mid-
dle East, where we still have troops de-
ployed, we should not be fomenting, en-
couraging, blundering toward rushing
into a third war in the Middle East. It
would suck lives and resources away
from more pressing priorities of our
citizens. Bogging ourselves down in an-
other war against a smaller, weaker,
faraway nation would divert our atten-
tion from acting firmly to counter our
chief competitor, China.
Furthermore, another war in the
Middle East would represent another
broken promise by this President. Just
as he said that Mexico would pay for a
border wall, just as he promised not to
cut the Medicaid Program before sup-
porting an effort to eliminate the Af-
fordable Care Act and slash Medicaid,
the President criticized the Iraq war as
a candidate and said he would end wars
in the Middle East, not expand or mul-
tiply them.
I will give my colleague from Arkan-
sas credit for having the courage of his
convictions to come and state what he
has stated on the floor. There are some
in this body and the administration
who have argued that a war with Iran
would be a good thing or a necessary
thing. Some have even suggested it
would be an easy win. Let them come
to the floor of the Senate and make
that argument in full view of the
American public and let Congress de-
bate and vote and then be held ac-
countable for decisions we make about
war.
As I conclude, I thank the majority
leader for scheduling this vote, and I
especially thank the Democratic leader
for firmly insisting it must be held. To-
morrow we will all speak to a funda-
mental question about war but also
about this institution: Can President
Trump take us to war with Iran with-
out even coming to Congress?
I hope my colleagues will stand for
the Constitution. We must provide as-
surance to our citizens, and we espe-
cially must provide assurance to our
troops, that war is not based on the
whim of this President or the whim of
any President, but it must be based in-
stead on a clear vote, following public
debate by the peoples’ elected legisla-
ture.
With that, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico.
Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I very
much appreciate being joined on the
floor by Senator KAINE and Senator
MERKLEY. I appreciate Senator KAINE’s
very wise words. I think all of us are
here standing up to hold the President
accountable. We believe he should fol-
low and obey the Constitution.
I rise to call upon this body to do its
duty, to assume its constitutional re-
sponsibility, and to make it clear that
the President cannot wage war against
Iran without congressional authoriza-
tion. Whether you are in favor of giv-
ing the President that authorization or
whether, like me, you are opposed, ev-
eryone in this Chamber should vote in
favor of our bipartisan amendment be-
cause a vote in favor is a vote to fulfill
our sworn oath to uphold the Constitu-
tion. I appreciate that at long last the
Senate will finally have this debate;
that we will finally take this vote be-
cause these matters of war and peace
are among the most consequential re-
sponsibilities that fall to Congress.
These are the hard votes, and we must
step up to take them.

upon Congress to meet its constitu-
tional responsibilities. After years of
abdicating our responsibilities on mat-
ters of war, this entire body must stand
up and show that we will not roll over
for an unauthorized, unconstitutional
war. We must pass this amendment.
This dangerous course with Iran
began last May when the President
unilaterally withdrew from the Iran
nuclear agreement. This hard-fought
diplomatic achievement denied Iran
the nuclear material required to even
begin work on a nuclear weapon. Since
this administration turned away from
diplomacy and resorted to a maximum
pressure campaign to box in Iran, the
risk of war has steadily risen.
Just last week, we were 10 minutes
away from a strike on Iran, 10 minutes
from a nightmare of escalation in the
Gulf. This week, the President threat-
ened Iran. I am quoting his words
here—these are pretty strong words—
he said to Iran: I threaten them with
‘‘great and overwhelming force,’’ and
he used the word ‘‘obliteration.’’ That
is not diplomacy; that is a drumbeat
toward war without congressional ap-
proval.
Tensions are the highest they have
been in many years, and the risk of a
costly miscalculation grows day by
day. Just days ago, the President false-
ly claimed he does not need congres-
sional approval to launch strikes
against Iran. Article I, section 8 of the
Constitution could not be clearer: It is
Congress and Congress alone that has
the authority to ‘‘declare war.’’ This is
not a close call; the Founders placed
this responsibility squarely on our
shoulders. The consequences of going
to war are profound, so this decision
rests with the people’s representatives,
not one person—not even one Presi-
dent. It is time that Congress confront
the administration’s rejection of diplo-
macy.
Our amendment prohibits funding for
military action against Iran without
congressional authorization. It does
not prohibit war altogether; it pro-
hibits an unconstitutional war, a war
that has not been authorized by Con-
gress.
We must be accountable to the Amer-
ican people and to our men and women
in uniform whose lives would be on the
line. Our soldiers are brave enough to
face the danger of war. If my friends in
this Chamber believe they should, we
should be brave enough to be held ac-
countable for that decision.
Some have claimed that this amend-
ment would prohibit the President
from defending the United States
against attack. That is wrong. It is
completely false. This amendment and
the War Powers Act incorporated as
part of it allow the United States to
act in self-defense. I am going to quote
from our amendment. The amendment
clearly states that it shall not be inter-
preted ‘‘to restrict the use of the
United States Armed Forces to defend
against an attack upon the United
States, its territories or possessions, or
its Armed Forces.’’ It is explicit. The
United States may defend itself against
an attack by Iran. The claim that the
military’s hands would be tied in the
event of an emergency has no basis and
cannot be used as an excuse to vote
against the amendment.
I am heartened, as Senator KAINE
was and as I am sure Senator MERKLEY
will also say, that Senator MCCONNELL
and the Republican leadership will fi-
nally allow debate and a vote on this
amendment. This is what the American
people want and deserve.
Over the years, Democratic and Re-
publican Presidents alike have steadily
encroached upon Congress’s war pow-
ers, and Congress has tacitly allowed
that encroachment.
I stood up to President Obama when
he threatened to attack Syria without
authorization, and so did many of my
colleagues. I am standing up again now
because the administration’s reckless
actions have brought us to the preci-
pice of war.
Mr. Bolton and Secretary Pompeo’s
failed strategy has led directly to these
heightened tensions, to the brink of
war, with no benefits to show for their
tactics.
The administration has reimposed
and tightened sanctions on Iran three
times—sanctions we agreed not to im-
pose if Iran agreed not to develop nu-
clear capabilities.
Secretary Pompeo placed a dozen
conditions on negotiations and then
withdrew them.
Just this week, at the same time
that Advisor Bolton claims we will
talk with Iran anytime, the President
sanctions the lead diplomat in Iran and
tweets out his threat of obliteration,
shutting the door on any diplomatic
overtures.
This ping-pong diplomacy, manufac-
tured crisis, and go-it-alone posture
further diminish our world’s standing
and credibility. None of the signatories
to the Iran nuclear agreement, includ-
ing our closest allies, backs us in what
we are doing.
This reckless diplomacy is dan-
gerously reminiscent of the run-up to
war with Iraq. But any war with Iran,
with its military capability, proxy
forces, and a population of 80 million
living in a geographically perilous re-
gion, would be more disastrous and
more costly than Iraq. Yet we continue
to march up to the brink.
According to the President’s tweet
last week, he stopped a strike against
Iran that he had already ordered be-
cause he learned at the last minute
that 150 lives were at stake. I know I
am not alone in being deeply alarmed
at this decisionmaking—national secu-
rity decisionmaking process. I know
Members on both sides of the aisle
share my concerns.
We must assert our constitutional
authority. We must tell the President
and affirm to the American people that
we will assume our constitutional re-
sponsibility. And we must do so now
before, through miscalculation, mis-
take, or misjudgment, our Nation finds
itself in yet another endless war.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon.
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President,
our Founders recognize that no deci-
sion carries more consequences than
the decision of whether to go to war.
They were well familiar with the car-
nage of human lives and blood, inju-
ries, and treasure that our initial war,
the War of Independence, brought.
As we stand here several hundred
years later, we recognize the wars in
between; that more than 400,000 Ameri-
cans died in World War II, that more
than 50,000 Americans died in the Viet-
nam war, and that more than 4,000
Americans died in the war in Iraq.
Those are just some indications of the
enormous impacts and consequences of
a decision to go to war.
It was an issue that the Founders
struggled with in a republic: Where
should this immense power rest?
Should it rest with one individual—the
President—or are the consequences too
great to have the judgment of a single
person carry the decision to its comple-
tion?
After intense debate, after many ar-
guments, the Founders became very
clear that this power should never rest
in the hands of a single person; that it
should not just be one body but two
bodies—the House and the Senate—
that should weigh in on the issue of
war. The consequences being so pro-
found, they could not leave it to the id-
iosyncrasies or the biases or the mis-
judgment of a single individual.
It was in fact one of the defining ar-
guments about the difference between
a King and a President. A King could
make that decision, with often horrific
consequences for the people of the
kingdom, but not in the United States
of America. This is why it is so deeply
embedded in our Constitution. In Arti-
cle I, section 8, under the enumerated
powers of Congress, are simply the
words ‘‘to declare war.’’ That power is
vested in Congress, not the President.
The Founders weighed in time and
again about this. Turning to James
Madison, the father of the Constitu-
tion, he commented:
The constitution supposes, what the His-
tory of all Governments demonstrates, that
the Executive is the branch of power most
interested in war, and most prone to it. It
has accordingly with studied care vested the
question of war to the Legislature.
He went on:
The power to declare war, including the
power of judging the causes of war, is fully
and exclusively vested in the legislature.
Madison continues:
The executive has no right, in any case, to
decide the question, whether there is or not
cause for declaring war.
He was the father of our Constitu-
tion. That led to this document that
vests the power to declare war with
Congress, not the President.
George Washington, the father of our
Nation, said: ‘‘The constitution vests

the power of declaring war in Congress;
therefore no offensive expedition of im-
portance can be undertaken until they
shall have deliberated upon the subject
and authorized such a measure.’’
This was the Commander in Chief
speaking. This was the hero of the
American Revolution speaking. This
was the man most trusted to be the
first President of the United States,
who was to steer the course and make
sure the Presidency did not become a
kingship. And his conclusion?
‘‘[T]herefore, no offensive expedition of
importance can be undertaken until
after they shall have . . . authorized
such a measure.’’
This is enormously at odds with the
vision our colleague from Arkansas
presented on the floor—dismissing the
role of Congress, dismissing the Con-
stitution, and instead saying let the
President, as Commander in Chief, do
what he will. That was not the vision.
George Mason of Virginia—if you
stand in DC, you can look across the
Potomac River, and you can see a
monument to George Mason. He made
notes of the Constitutional Conven-
tion. George Mason remarked that he
was ‘‘against giving the power of war
to the executive’’ because the Presi-
dent ‘‘is not safely to be trusted with
it.’’ That was the point, that no one in-
dividual, no matter how wise—not even
a George Washington—could be trusted
with this decision. George Washington,
as President, agreed with this com-
pletely, that despite his expertise as a
Commander in Chief, it was not to be
the judgment of one person.
Thomas Jefferson, one of the most
brilliant minds our country has ever
produced, commented: ‘‘We have al-
ready given in example’’—referring to
the Constitution—‘‘one effectual check
to the dog of war by transferring the
power of letting him’’—the dog of
war—‘‘loose from the Executive to the
Legislative.’’ So he is commenting on
the Constitution and saying: We have
put a check on the dog of war by put-
ting that power in the legislative body,
not the executive.
Jefferson became President. Did he
change his mind when he became Presi-
dent? His initial quote I gave you was
from 1789, but later he became Presi-
dent of the United States. And what
did he think then? He thought the
same exact thing, just as President
Washington had. Jefferson said: ‘‘Con-
sidering that Congress alone is con-
stitutionally invested with the power
of changing our condition from peace
to war, I have thought it my duty to
await their authority for using force in
any degree which could be avoided’’—
his message to Congress in 1805.
He recognized what the Constitution
did. Are we going to recognize the con-
stitutional vision? Now, there may be
folks in this Chamber who simply dis-
agree with the Founders and say that
Congress is too complicated, that the
power to declare war and the power to
go to war should be vested solely in the
Commander in Chief. Well, then, come
and present a constitutional amend-
ment on the floor of the U.S. Senate.
You took an oath to the Constitution
of the United States, and that oath
says that power rests in this body.
If you want to change the Constitu-
tion, then, have the guts to come down
here and propose doing so. I guarantee
it will be roundly defeated because the
wisdom of our Founders that it is a
mistake to give the power of war to
one person is wise and does stand the
test of time.
Alexander Hamilton noted the fol-
lowing:
The Congress shall have the power to de-
clare war; the plain meaning of which is,
that it is the peculiar and exclusive duty of
Congress, when the Nation is at peace, to
change that state into a state of war. . . .
Alexander Hamilton said: ‘‘exclusive
duty of Congress’’ and ‘‘the plain
meaning’’ of our Constitution.
This viewpoint continued to carry
the day far into the future. Abraham
Lincoln was speaking in 1848, and he
said:
The provision of the Constitution giving
the war-making powers to Congress, was dic-
tated, as I understand it, by the following
reasons.
Those are Lincoln’s words.
Kings had always been involving and im-
poverishing their people in wars, pretending
generally, if not always, that the good of the
people was the object. This, our [Constitu-
tional] Convention understood to be the
most oppressive of all Kingly oppressions
and they resolved to so frame the Constitu-
tion that no one man should hold the power
of bringing this oppression upon us.
In the words of these great leaders of
America—Washington, Hamilton,
Mason, President Lincoln—all point to
the power and wisdom of putting the
decision about war with the House and
the Senate, not the President.
Now, this resolution before us says:
Mr. President, there is no foregoing au-
thorization to go to war against Iran.
It says: Any authorization has to come
after debate specifically on that topic.
And why is this? Because we have
heard from the administration that
they want to use the 2001 authorization
for the use of military force, an author-
ization specifically about al-Qaida in
Afghanistan, to authorize war with
Iran. Nothing could be more con-
voluted, and that is why we need to
stand up and say: That is wrong. That
is not right.
Anyone who pays even just a mod-
icum of attention knows that the reso-
lution to take on al-Qaida in Afghani-
stan is very different than going to war
against the Shiite Islam nation of Iran.
But we have to say it because the ad-
ministration has been trying to pre-
pare the case saying this 2001 resolu-
tion somehow has a link that author-
izes war.
And why are we so concerned at this
moment? Why are we here on the floor
in this debate? Well, it is because the
drums of war are beating loudly. It is
because the President has deployed the
Abraham Lincoln carrier strike force to
the Gulf to threaten Iran. It is because
the President has preplaced a squadron
of B–52 bombers to be ready to bomb
Iran. Why are we so concerned—when
we have a National Security Advisor
who has said that no agreement can
ever be reached with Iran and we have
to bomb them and when we have a Sec-
retary of State who says that no one
has ever stood up to Iran and we have
to teach them a lesson, or words to
that effect, and we have a President
who has proceeded to say that any at-
tack will be met by great and over-
whelming force?
So envision these preplaced forces.
And, in fact, the President has declared
that a section of the Iranian military,
the Revolutionary Guard is a terrorist
force. Add all of that up, and the Presi-
dent is talking about looking for a
trigger to apply great and over-
whelming force. That is why we are
here. A response in proportion to de-
fend a direct attack on the United
States is authorized by the War Powers
Act. That is honored by the resolution
that is before us, the Udall-Paul-Kaine
amendment that is before us. That is
honored. But as for the use of great and
overwhelming force the President is
threatening, that is war. That has to
come before this body.
The President went on and said: ‘‘In
some areas, overwhelming will mean
obliteration.’’ So for any attack? And
we have heard the Secretary of State
say if there is a Shiite force in Iraq
that we can tie to Shiites in Iran and
some communication, we will consider
that an attack by Iran—looking for a
trigger to go to war. And the President
has said any act will be met with over-
whelming force.
Not under our Constitution. You
want that authority? You come here.
You want to change the Constitution?
Then, come here. I say this to my fel-
low Senators: Do you want to change
the Constitution? Bring your amend-
ment to the floor of the Senate to
change the Constitution.
The Constitution speaks clearly. The
President has no authority to apply
overwhelming force or obliterating
force and conduct a war against Iran.
Make your case here or honor the Con-
stitution.
We are in a troubling and difficult
time, and I would like to see every
Member of the Senate down here talk-
ing to each other about this. That is
the gravity of the consequences. It is
not a few Members who are here to
stand up for our Constitution and the
vision of wisdom in our Constitution.
This is the time, before there is that
trigger in which the President responds
with great and overwhelming force and
before he responds with obliterating
force. Now is the time to pass this
amendment put together in a bipar-
tisan fashion that lays out the funda-
mental requirements of our Constitu-
tion and the fundamental requirements
embraced by the Founders and the fun-
damental requirements repeated and
honored by the greatest Presidents who
have ever served our Nation.

MILITARY WIDOW’S TAX ELIMINATION ACT
Mr. JONES. Madam President, I ap-
proach to say how much I appreciate
my colleagues, Senator MERKLEY and
Senator KAINE, for their eloquent
thoughts on an important issue of our
time.
Let me also now rise in total frustra-
tion on a completely different issue—
but total frustration, bafflement, and,
quite frankly, just angry and dis-
appointed in this body. I am angry be-
cause we have turned our back for over
40 years on military families. We have
turned our backs on the widows of the
very men and women who have given
their lives to protect this country, to
uphold our democratic ideals, and to
make possible the very work that we
are doing in the Senate and the very
work that we, as Members of the Sen-
ate and as Members of Congress, are
charged to do every day on behalf of
the American people and, particularly,
on behalf of veterans and their fami-
lies.
I am talking about this body’s re-
fusal to bring up the Military Widow’s
Tax Elimination Act—the refusal to
bring it up for a single floor vote—de-
spite the fact that we have 75 cospon-
sors—75 cosponsors of this bill. It is the
most bipartisan legislation, except for
the robocall bill, which everybody
could agree on. And we can’t get that
to a vote in this body?
Where have we gone wrong? Where
have the rules of the body—the rules
that the leadership of both parties are
operating under—gone off the rails
that we can’t bring this to a vote, to
just get a simple up-or-down vote, on a
process that is ripe, and that is the
NDAA?
In my 17 or 18 months—I forget how
many now in this body—I have had
some frustrating moments, as I know
all of my colleagues who have been
here for a long time have had a lot of
frustrating moments. We have shut
down this government three times
since I have been a U.S. Senator—three
times. I have seen disaster relief held
up for 5 or 6 months, with farmers and
others needing that relief, needing that
money, needing that help, and we held
it up for political reasons so that some-
one can score a point because every-
thing is seen through the eyes of a po-
litical gamesmanship. That is how we
are operating today, and it is incred-
ibly frustrating for those of us who
want to make sure we go forward with
things when we see bipartisan efforts.
In this situation, we are talking
about military families who are get-
ting ripped off by us. You can call it
the government if you want to, but at
the end of the day, they are getting
ripped off by every single Member of
this body and the House of Representa-
tives, and they have had it. It is no
wonder that the American people think
that Congress and Washington, in gen-
eral, are just completely broken. If we
can’t fight for military widows and
spouses, who are having their survivor
benefits shortchanged, then, for whom
are we going to fight? For whom are we
going to stand up?
We always talk about standing up for
the least of these. I have people want-
ing to stand up for the immigrants
coming across the border. I have people
wanting to stand up for corporations
and to make sure that they are paying
their share of the taxes, as opposed to
overburden. I have people standing up
for people every day, but here we have
a chance to stand up for people who
have given their lives for this country,
and we are not doing it. We are not
doing it.
If we can’t do the right thing on this,
with 75 cosponsors, how can we pos-
sibly tackle immigration reform? How
can we possibly tackle healthcare re-
form or education in this country if we
can’t come to some agreement and one
simple vote when we have 75 cospon-
sors?
How can we not fight for people like
Cathy Milford, a retired schoolteacher
from Mobile, AL, whose husband passed
away unexpectedly 25 years ago from a
service-connected illness just months
after his retirement from the Coast
Guard? Instead of a long and happy re-
tirement together, Cathy has been
fighting to right this wrong for all of
the some 65,000 military spouses who
are hurt by the current law.
During a recent visit here to Capitol
Hill, she said: ‘‘Every time I talk about
this’’—and she is up here a lot talking
about elimination of the military wid-
ow’s tax—‘‘I have to dig up my husband
and bury him all over again.’’
Just think about that. Let that just
sink in a minute: a military widow, one
of many of thousands, who had to re-
turn to lobby Congress year after year
at their own expense, saying she feels
like she is digging up and burying her
husband all over again when she has to
talk about this issue. That is not only
sad, it is shameful.
We have tried to pass this legislation.
The Senate has, in some form, repeat-
edly over the last almost 20 years. It
has been included in the NDAA numer-
ous times only to be stripped out dur-
ing conference. It has been included
without an immediate pay-for to offset
the budget issues that everybody kind
of falls back on and hangs their hat on.
We don’t have that immediate pay-for.
It has passed before. It has passed be-
fore in this body with bipartisan sup-
port, but for some reason it just hasn’t
been able to get across the finish line.
For some reason, even though the bill
today has historic levels of cosponsor-
ship, we are not allowed to bring it up
for a vote as an amendment to this
NDAA. Frankly, that is the frustra-
tion.
It is a frustration that goes beyond
just this bill. It is a frustration that we
can’t debate on the floor of the Senate
anymore. We can’t bring up amend-
ments. I think we have brought up one
amendment in legislation in this Con-
gress because of the rule between the
leader and minority leader. There are
all these deals going on. You have to
have a Republican package; you have
to have a Democratic package; you
have to play one against the other. We
are constantly playing the political
games in this body when we should be
working for the American people as a
whole.
That is why today, at this time, I am
once again calling for our bill to elimi-
nate the military widow’s tax, to pass
it or get it voted on and bring it to the
floor and pass it on unanimous con-
sent. Every one of my colleagues would
do well to remember that we are the
ones who should be fighting for these
spouses. We are the ones. We are the
only people they can turn to. This
can’t be fixed on the streets. It can’t be
fixed at the Department of Defense or
the Veterans’ Administration. The leg-
islature, the Congress of the United
States, is the only one that can do it,
and we are the ones who should be
fighting for these military spouses, the
widows and widowers whose loved ones
gave their lives for this country, the
widows and widowers whose lives are
forever changed because of their fam-
ily’s selfless service to this country.
Caring for military families has long
been part of the foundation of our gov-
ernment. In President Abraham Lin-
coln’s second inaugural address, he
spoke in no uncertain terms on this ob-
ligation. In the midst of the Civil War,
he addressed a nation that had sus-
tained unimaginable loss—unimagi-
nable loss—in order to preserve the
Union we so cherish.
The country was then more divided
than it ever had been, and God help us
if it ever gets that divided again, but
the values Lincoln asserted during that
speech were so fundamental that, even
at war with itself, it could agree on the
importance.
He said this:
With malice toward none, with charity for
all, with firmness in the right as God gives
us to see the right, let us strive on to finish
the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s
wounds, to care for him who shall have borne
the battle and for his widow, and his orphan,
to do all which we may achieve and cherish
a just and lasting peace among ourselves and
with all nations.
Let me repeat that critical phrase
today: ‘‘ . . . to care for him who shall
have borne the battle and for his
widow, and his orphan.’’
This is the promise we have made to
those who raise their hand in service to
our Nation. This is the contract, the
solemn contract, that we have made to
those who have raised their hand in
service to this Nation; that we will
honor and support them and care for
their families if tragedy occurs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4596 June 27, 2019
President Lincoln was assassinated
just over a month after he issued this
appeal, but the weight of his words still
resonate today. In some ways, on this
issue, they resonate more because in
those days you could count on the fact
that the legislative body, the Congress
of the United States, heeded those
words and took care of those families.
It has been 154 years since President
Lincoln spoke those words; yet the
Government of the United States, the
Members of this body, the Members of
the House have yet to fulfill that prom-
ise. It has been 154 years, and we still
get caught up in the deals that are
made as to what gets on the floor and
what does not get on the floor, the po-
litical deals that have to be jockeyed,
where we give and take, and it is one
over the other. We need to fix that
today.
We need to fix it in a broader sense
and let this body get back to its real
work and be the great deliberative
body it is supposed to be. We are not
doing that, but that is a different issue
for a different time.
Let’s start today and stand up and
exhibit just a fraction, a small frac-
tion—a small, small fraction—of the
courage that these military spouses did
on our behalf. Let’s let our actions
speak louder than words simply ever
could. Let’s put the issue to rest and
give these widows some peace.
Let us do our duty.
It was Atticus Finch, who told the
jury in ‘‘To Kill a Mockingbird,’’ as he
closed out, knowing what the outcome
was going to be, as I do here—knowing
what the outcome was going to be, it
was Atticus Finch, who said: ‘‘In the
name of God, do your duty.’’
I say that to this body. I say that to
the leadership. In the name of God,
let’s do our duty to these people. Let’s
get behind the political deals and let’s
do our duty, once and for all.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—AMENDMENT
NO. 269
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that it be in order to set aside the
pending amendment; that amendment
No. 269 be considered and agreed to;
and that the motion to reconsider be
considered made and laid upon the
table with no intervening action or de-
bate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
an objection?
The Senator from Oklahoma.
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right, let me share a story of
something that happened.
The timing sometimes happens at
very inconvenient times, but on Sep-
tember 7, 2011, I was in my State of
Oklahoma and was in Collinsville, OK.
Probably not many people have been to
Collinsville, OK, but I have. It was the
home of a really beloved individual and
family. The family was the Chris Hor-
ton family, and the wife was Jane Hor-
ton.
I remember it so well. This was Sep-
tember 7, 2011. I was talking to the
group, and I was telling them that I
was preparing to make one of my reg-
ular trips to Afghanistan. At that time,
I was not chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, but I was a
high-ranking member of the Senate
Armed Services Committee.
In the audience was Jane Horton, and
Jane said: Well, if you are going to go
over there, why don’t you go by and see
my husband, Chris? I said: I will do it.
I found out his whereabouts, exactly
where he was. I got over there to look
up Chris, only to find out that 2 days
after I made that commitment in Col-
linsville, OK, that Chris died in action.
Chris died in action. I was the one who
had to call on and share that with his
wife, Jane Horton.
In fact, after that, we hired Jane to
go around and help us with the widows’
benefits. Starting at that time, I was
the leader and continued to be a leader
long before the Senator from Alabama
was into this, and he will agree that I
was actively working on this issue.
I support and will continue to sup-
port the permanent fix. It is going to
happen. We are going to do it. In fact,
I am the first Senate Armed Services
chairman to cosponsor this legislation.
Mr. JONES mentioned there were 75
people who cosponsored it. That is I. I
was on there on the initial legislation
and will continue to be and will always
be, and that reflects my commitment
to the permanent fix.
Here is the problem we have. There
has to be a fix, but it can’t be on this
bill. The reason it can’t be on this bill
is because it has a mandatory spending
that has no offset, and there is not an
exception to this on the bill. This is
part of the agreement in bringing the
bill up.
Now, what we can do is go ahead and
do what is necessary with this very
popular cause, and I will be standing
with the Senator from Alabama to
make sure this happens.
Let’s assume that were not true, that
we couldn’t do it under the rules.
Under the rules, there is another rule
that, if there is an objection to any
amendments coming up, then I, as the
chairman of the committee, if the
party objecting is not here, I have to
offer his objection.
There is an objection to this, and I
will therefore object and be in the
strongest position of helping this to be-
come a reality. I owe it not just to the
many people I know but also to the
family whom I just referred to from
Collinsville.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Alabama.
Mr. JONES. I thank my friend and
colleague Chairman INHOFE, and let me
say I know where he has been on this
issue. I have seen his speeches from
years past on this issue, and I do appre-
ciate that, and I appreciate the fact
that he is a cosponsor.
I also know this has been put on an
NDAA before in this body without a
pay-for, without an offset, in order to
have a sense of the Senate and to go on
record, and that is what I think we
should do. I understand we are not
there this year for whatever reason. I
still believe, in part, that it is a proce-
dural issue that ought to be put aside
for this, but that is an argument for
another day.
I do so very much appreciate the
chairman’s remarks. I have enjoyed
working with him, Senator REED, and
others on the NDAA. That has been an
effort. I told folks back home and
across the country where I have spoken
that I wish people could have actually
seen what happened in that markup be-
hind closed doors and the bipartisan-
ship that the chairman showed and the
other Senators showed. I wish people
could have seen it because we don’t get
to see it. I don’t think if we opened it
up that we would have seen it, but it
was remarkable.
So we are where we are in the Sen-
ate. I understand that, and I knew that
coming in here. I will simply say this.
The House of Representatives is also
going to take up the NDAA, and I hope
my colleagues on the other side of the
wonderful Capitol are listening. Put it
in. It is not in the committee bill. Put
it in. Bring it to conference because, if
it gets to conference, I am going to
continue to have this in this NDAA,
and let’s get this done, once and for all.
Thank you, Chairman INHOFE, and
thank you, Mr. President.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota.
EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS
BILLS
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if I
might, let me describe where things are
in the state of play with respect to the
supplemental appropriations bill that
deals with the border.
I know the situation at our border
has been at a crisis point for weeks
now. Our agencies are stretched to the
breaking point, struggling to care for
the overwhelming flow of migrants; yet
we have House Democrats continuing
to play politics with the border funding
bill.
Again, to describe the state of play,
we had a request from the President 7
weeks ago for $4.5 billion to address
this humanitarian crisis we are having
at our southern border, and the Demo-
crats didn’t act on it. They described it
as a manufactured crisis. When I say
the Democrats, I am talking about the
House Democrats, which is where most
spending bills originate.
After the House failed to act and
failed to respond to the President’s re-
quest for emergency funding, the Sen-
ate decided to act. So the Senate Ap-
propriations Committee took up and
passed a bipartisan bill out of the Ap-
propriations Committee by a vote of 30
to 1—not a vote that you see all that
often around here these days.
So that bill was reported out to the
floor. In the meantime, the House
Democrats decided that maybe it
wasn’t, after all, a manufactured crisis
and perhaps they needed to act. So

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4597
June 27, 2019
they picked up a bill—a partisan bill—
and passed it out of the House of Rep-
resentatives on a party-line basis, after
which the Senate voted on its bill, the
bill I mentioned that was reported out
of the Appropriations Committee by a
vote of 30 to 1, and it came to the floor
where it passed yesterday by a vote of
84 to 8—84 to 8 in the U.S. Senate.
Well, just to demonstrate that the bi-
partisan bill passed by the Senate is
the vehicle that should move forward
and should go to the President for his
signature, the President had indicated
he would veto the House-passed bill,
but we took it up. We took up the
House-passed bill yesterday on the
floor of the U.S. Senate. We had a vote
on it. It got 37 votes here on the floor
of the Senate—not nearly enough, obvi-
ously, to pass the Senate. Of course, it
was going to meet a certain veto by the
President even if it had.
That being said, there were 37 votes
for the House-passed partisan bill that
came out of the House of Representa-
tives. Here on the floor of the Senate,
there were 84 votes for the bipartisan
bill produced by the Senate Appropria-
tions Committee.
Where we are right now is that was
sent back to the House. The House,
frankly, should just take up that bill
and pass it. We know for certain the
President would sign it. Again, I think
it demonstrates a body of work that re-
flects the will of both sides, Repub-
licans and Democrats—certainly in the
Senate—to get a vote of 30 to 1 out of
the Appropriations Committee or 84 to
8 on the floor of the Senate. You had to
have a high level of bipartisan coopera-
tion.
That bill to address the humani-
tarian crisis at our border is awaiting
action by the House of Representa-
tives. All they have to do is simply
pick it up and pass it and send it to the
President, where it will be signed into
law, and we will get much needed re-
sources and much needed manpower to
the southern border, where they des-
perately need it. I hope that will be the
case.
We are being told that the House is
now considering sending yet another
partisan bill over here to the Senate.
The only thing I can tell you is, if you
want to get legislation signed into law
by the President of the United States
that actually does deliver and put the
much needed assistance on the ground
that is desperately needed on the
southern border, the only surefire way
to do that right now is for the House to
pick up the Senate-passed bill, which
passed here with 84 votes, pass it, and
send it to the President, where it will
be signed into law, and that $4.5 billion
will be on its way to the border to as-
sist with all the needs down there that
are currently being unmet. I hope that
can happen yet today.
That is the state of play with respect
to the supplemental appropriations
bill.
DEMOCRATIC PARTY
Mr. President, I think 2019 is going to
go down in history for the Democratic
Party. It has been a notable year.
While the Democratic Party has ob-
viously always been left of center, I
never expected to see the Democratic
Party running so far to the left of the
American people or wholeheartedly
embracing socialism and a government
takeover of a large part of the econ-
omy.
The socialist fantasies are rapidly
piling up: a government takeover of
healthcare, a government takeover of
the energy sector, government-funded
college, a government writeoff of all
student loan debts, guaranteed income,
government-guaranteed housing, and
on and on. So what is wrong with that?
After all, those proposals sound really
nice—free healthcare, free college, the
government guaranteeing you an in-
come. Here is the problem: Providing
all that stuff is going to cost a lot of
money, an almost inconceivable
amount of money. Somebody is going
to have to pay. You might say that ob-
viously the government is going to
pay, but the government has to get its
money from somewhere. Here is the
catch: The government gets its money
from the taxpayers.
Can’t we just take that money from
rich taxpayers? If you talk to some of
the socialist Democrats offering these
proposals, they will talk about making
the rich pay. The rich are their favor-
ite funding mechanism. Want free col-
lege? We just get the rich to pay for it.
Want free healthcare? We can just get
the rich to pay for it. There is just one
big problem with that: There aren’t
enough rich people in America to even
come close to paying for Democrats’
socialist fantasies. Deep down, Demo-
crats know it, which is why they tend
to get very foggy when pressed on the
details of how they are going to pay for
some of their plans.
Take the junior Senator from
Vermont’s proposal of a government
takeover of America’s health insur-
ance, the so-called Medicare for All
plan. A conservative estimate puts the
cost of that plan at $32 trillion over 10
years. The current cost is likely much
higher since the Senator from
Vermont’s most recent plan for govern-
ment-run healthcare also includes
long-term care, which we all know is
an incredibly expensive benefit.
The Senator from Vermont did re-
lease a list of proposed tax hikes to pay
for his proposal. The only problem is,
the tax hikes wouldn’t come close to
covering the estimated cost of his
original Medicare for All plan, much
less the cost of his new expanded Medi-
care fantasy.
Of course, as staggering as the costs
of Medicare for All would be—more
money than the Federal Government
spent in the last 8 years combined on
everything—they pale in comparison to
the cost of the so-called Green New
Deal. An initial estimate found that
the Green New Deal would cost some-
where between $51 trillion and $93 tril-
lion over 10 years—$93 trillion. That is
more money than the 2017 gross domes-
tic product for the entire world. That
is right. You could take the entire eco-
nomic output of every country in the
world in 2017, and it still might not pay
for the Democrats’ socialist fantasy.
Once you realize that, it is pretty obvi-
ous that the Green New Deal is not a
plan that could be paid for by taxing
the rich.
How about taxing every household
making more than $200,000 a year at a
100-percent rate for 10 years? That
wouldn’t even get you close to $93 tril-
lion. How about taxing every household
making more than $100,000 at a 100-per-
cent rate for 10 years? That wouldn’t
get you anywhere close to $93 trillion.
Like Medicare for All, the Green New
Deal would be paid for on the backs of
working families.
I have talked a lot about the money
aspect of Democrats’ socialist pro-
posals, and that is one of the major
problems with these proposals—they
sound nice until you realize that actu-
ally nothing is really free. Working
Americans are still going to be paying
for the cost of all those programs
through new and much higher taxes.
But that is far from the only problem
with some of the Democrats’ socialist
fantasies. Leaving aside the fact that
the Federal Government is not exactly
known for its efficiency or bringing
programs in on time and on budget,
there is the tremendous cost Ameri-
cans will pay in the loss of their free-
dom, the loss of their autonomy. Amer-
icans are used to choices and being able
to make their own decisions. It is part
of our heritage. Those are freedoms we
cherish. That is not the way things
work under socialism.
Nowhere is this more obvious than
with Medicare for All. Medicare for All
doesn’t give Americans health insur-
ance options; it takes them away. Are
you part of the majority of Americans
who are happy with their current
healthcare? Too bad. Medicare for All
eliminates all private insurance plans
and replaces them with a single, gov-
ernment-run, one-size-fits-all plan.
Under Medicare for All, private health
insurance plans as we know them
would actually be illegal. If you are not
happy with the government-run plan,
too bad; you won’t have any other
choices.
The treatment options would also be
limited by what the government de-
cides. If the government doesn’t want
to pay for a particular cancer treat-
ment, for example, as has happened in
other countries with socialized medi-
cine, you will be out of luck.
Then, of course, there are the long
wait times that are the hallmark of so-
cialized medicine. Imagine having to
wait months for diagnostic imagining
or needed surgery or having to stand by
while your spouse or child is forced to
wait months for care. That is the kind
of thing Americans would have to look
forward to under Medicare for All.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4598 June 27, 2019
Margaret Thatcher once said that the
problem with socialism is that eventu-
ally you run out of other people’s
money. Once Democrats have taken
every dollar they can from the rich to
pay for their socialist fantasies, they
will come after the paychecks of ordi-
nary Americans, who will face higher
and higher taxes for fewer and fewer
benefits and greatly reduced choices.
Democrats’ socialist dreams would
quickly trap the American people in a
nightmare.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, before I
deliver comments on a bill that I am
introducing, let me express my dis-
appointment that the Senate will not
be voting today on the amendment
that Senator JONES and I have filed to
eliminate the military widow’s tax.
This is a tremendous inequity, as is
recognized by the fact that 75 of our
colleagues have cosponsored our free-
standing bill.
Nevertheless, I am heartened by the
commitment and the compassion of the
Senate Armed Services Committee
chairman, Senator INHOFE, who has in-
dicated his receptivity to dealing with
this issue but in a different way on a
different bill. I hope that today is just
a temporary setback and that we can
see this bill taken up as a freestanding
bill by the entire Senate.
Mr. President, I send a bill to the
desk and ask that it be appropriately
referred.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will be
received and appropriately referred.

taining to the introduction of S. 2018

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

S. 1790
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I
rise to explain the context in which I
will vote for the Romney amendment.
First, I am grateful for Senator ROM-
NEY’s substantive contributions and his
collegiality as a member of the Foreign
Relations Committee.
The plain text of the amendment
states the obvious—that funds author-
ized by the NDAA may be used to en-
sure the ability of our Armed Forces to
defend themselves and U.S. citizens.
I believe every Member of this body
certainly shares the fundamental un-
derstanding that our Armed Forces
must have the ability to defend them-
selves and our citizens against foreign
enemies. Indeed, the purpose of the
NDAA is to provide the authorizations
that are necessary to ensure the De-
partment of Defense is in a position to
defend the United States and our citi-
zens.
In my opinion, in that respect, this
amendment is not necessary. For any-
one who argues that the Romney lan-
guage is somehow necessary because of
the Udall amendment that we will be
voting on tomorrow, I say reread the
Udall amendment. It includes an ex-
plicit exception for self-defense.
I am concerned that this administra-
tion will seek to twist the Romney
amendment into something that is
completely unrecognizable, something
that we are not voting on today, and
something that has no basis in law. As
a legal matter, the amendment does
nothing more than to explicitly pro-
vide the authority to use funds under
the act to ensure this ability.
Let me be clear. This amendment
does nothing more than that. Either
implicitly or explicitly, it does not au-
thorize the use of military force. Let
me repeat. It is not an AUMF. An ex-
plicit authorization would have to
come to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee following serious and sub-
stantive engagement by the executive
branch.
It is no secret that there are some in
this administration who are eager to
engage militarily with Iran. This week,
the President himself argued that he
does not have to go to Congress to seek
authorization. But those who don’t
want to completely bypass our congres-
sional prerogative will be grasping at
any purported source of authority that
could justify, in their minds, that Con-
gress has authorized these actions.
Look no further than the Secretary
of State, who is purportedly pushing
the bogus legal theory that the 2001
AUMF, which Congress passed in the
wake of 9/11, somehow provides author-
ity to use force against Iran. Appar-
ently, Secretary Pompeo is not dis-
suaded by the facts. The plain language
of the 2001 AUMF does not extend to
Iran. Congress did not intend for the
2001 AUMF to cover Iran, and neither
Republican nor Democratic Presidents
who have operated pursuant to this
AUMF have claimed such authority.
Against this backdrop and a Presi-
dent who has evaded Congress in un-
precedented and unlawful ways, we
must make crystal clear that the Rom-
ney amendment cannot be abused by
those in this administration who ap-
pear to be desperate to build a case
that the President has all of the au-
thority he needs to take us into war
with Iran.
We cannot leave anything up to
chance when it comes to the choice of
whether we send our sons and daugh-
ters into war. I believe we should be
having a serious conversation about
our use of military force and about
what constitutes self-defense and at-
tacks on our allies.
I am pleased that the chairman of
the Foreign Relations Committee has
previously committed to holding these
hearings, and I believe we should com-
mence with hearings with multiple
stakeholders, including the adminis-
tration itself. Previous administrations
have sent up representatives to explain
to Congress their rationale for war or
to explain the type of authorizations
they are seeking. We should demand
nothing less from this administration.
I support the amendment, and I look
forward to continuing appropriate
oversight over the executive branch’s
pursuit of military action around the
world.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah.
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to complete my re-
marks before the vote.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I thank
my esteemed friend and ranking mem-
ber of the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee for his kind words in support of
my amendment.
As we debate the Defense Authoriza-
tion Act today, one of our most press-
ing concerns is how we deter Iran from
further escalating its attacks. The de-
cisions we make on this bill will have
a direct bearing on the options the
President and the military have avail-
able to keep our military, our citizens,
and our friends and allies safe.
The Senate is poised to vote soon on
my amendment, No. 861. It would reaf-
firm what has long been American pol-
icy. Our military is authorized to de-
fend itself and to protect our citizens.
Enacting this amendment makes it
clear to our military, as well as to any
potential adversary, that America does
not shrink in the face of attack. This is
not an authorization to use military
force against Iran or anyone else; it is
a statement of continued commitment
to our national defense.
Under the Constitution, only Con-
gress may declare war, but also under
the Constitution, the President can de-
fend against attacks and can respond
in an appropriate manner to an attack
that has been made.
As we all know, my esteemed col-
league from New Mexico, Senator
UDALL, has proposed an amendment on
a related topic which I wish to briefly
address.
We do not need the Udall amendment
to tell us what the Constitution al-
ready demands—that Congress alone
can declare war. His amendment is
clearly intended to limit the President
in some other ways that he has not yet
explained to this body.
As it is written, the Udall amend-
ment would dramatically limit the ex-
isting authority that the Constitution
provides to the President to respond to
Iran. It would prevent the President

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4599
June 27, 2019
from defending U.S. citizens, U.S. in-
terests, and our allies. This is not only
my opinion; it is the carefully consid-
ered conclusion of the U.S. Department
of Defense.
In its letter on June 26 to Chairman
INHOFE, it states this, referring to the
Udall amendment:
‘‘The Department strongly opposes this
amendment . . . At a time when Iran is en-
gaging in escalating military provocation
. . . this amendment could embolden Iran to
further provocations.’’
Tying the President’s hands in some
undefined way in the midst of the cur-
rent crisis is misguided, dangerous, and
surely sends the wrong message to both
Iran and to our allies.
Last week, the Iranians continued
their provocative escalation in the
Middle East. After weeks of buildup in
which Iran attacked six commercial
ships, and its proxies bombed an oil
pipeline and launched a rocket into a
commercial Saudi Arabian airport,
Iran shot down an American drone over
international waters.
The Udall amendment raises serious
questions about how the military could
respond to these attacks after the fact.
Could we fire on the missile launcher
that downed our drone? Could we sink
one of their small, outboard motor ves-
sels that attached the mines to the
ships that were attacked?
Imagine for a moment that in the fu-
ture, another American aircraft, per-
haps one that is manned by an Amer-
ican pilot, were to be shot down by an
Iranian rocket. It is possible that the
Udall amendment would limit our mili-
tary’s options to subsequently respond
to such an outrage.
I don’t pretend to know whether Iran
will continue its pattern of aggression,
but I do know that when bad actors
think they can escape consequence for
malevolent acts, such acts are more
likely to occur in the future.
I am glad that Senator UDALL’s re-
vised amendment concedes the broad
point that our military has the inher-
ent right of self-defense. But in the
case of a rocket hitting one of our
planes, the President should not have
his hands tied in responding after such
an attack in an appropriate manner.
Note also that while the Udall
amendment provides for the military
to defend itself from attack, it does not
provide for the defense of our citizens.
Iran could take this as an invitation to
attack Americans abroad.
Further, it would prohibit our mili-
tary from defending or responding to
an attack by Iran on our Iraqi partners
so long as it didn’t directly hit Amer-
ican troops. Passing the Udall amend-
ment would effectively give a green
light to Iranian forces to carry out at-
tacks in Iraq so long as they don’t at-
tack U.S. forces.
If Iran were to attack Israel, one of
our NATO allies, the Udall amendment
would not allow the President to re-
spond.
Finally, by carving out Iranian terri-
tory, the Udall amendment would po-
tentially prevent us from pursuing and
taking out terrorists who seek refuge
in Iran.
I oppose the Udall amendment not
because I want to go to war with Iran
or rush to respond without carefully
evaluating our long-term strategy to
counter Iranian aggression. I know no
one who wants to go to war with Iran.
I fully concur with my many Senate
colleagues who desire to reassert the
constitutional role of Congress in de-
claring war. But to engage in this ef-
fort now, and in an undefined way, and
then to attach that to Iran when Iran
has just shot down an American air-
craft would send a terrible message to
the Ayatollahs and to the world.
I mean, think about it. Iran shoots
down an American aircraft, and what
does the U.S. Senate rush to do? It
rushes to vote in some undefined way
to restrict military consequence. That
is simply unthinkable.
My amendment is not about Iran. It
does not even mention Iran. My amend-
ment is about affirming the constitu-
tional authorities that any President
must have to properly protect and de-
fend this Nation.
As the Department of Defense main-
tains, the President of the United
States must always have the option of
responding to attacks by Iran or any-
one else at a time and place of our
choosing—today and in the future.
I urge my colleagues to support my
amendment.

there anything in the amendment that
confers any new authority on the
President.
As Senator ROMNEY, the author of
the amendment, stated on the floor a
half-hour ago, ‘‘[t]his [amendment] is
not an authorization to use military
force against Iran or anyone else. . . .
Under the Constitution, only Congress

Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I will
reassert the same thing I just heard
from the minority leader. I appreciate
his words.
This amendment would reaffirm a
basic principle. The United States has
the right to defend itself and our citi-
zens when attacked. It asserts what has
always been a bedrock constitutional
principle. This is not an AUMF. It is
not an authorization for the use of
military force.
Passing my amendment today would
send a strong signal to our adversaries
that we will defend ourselves if our in-
terests, our people, our military, our
allies are threatened and attacked.
My amendment is something that I
believe everyone in this body can and
should support.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Cloture

commit and the amendments pending

Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

S. 1790
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to
speak on the importance of the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2020 legislation that au-
thorizes $750 billion for defense, con-
sistent with the administration’s budg-
et request and the National Defense
Strategy Commission report.
The NDAA is a critical piece of legis-
lation. It supports our Armed Forces,
our men and women in uniform, and
provides for the defense of our Nation.
Among its notable provisions, the bill
supports a 3.1-percent pay increase for
the members of our armed services, the
largest in nearly a decade and very
much deserved by the men and women
in uniform who protect us.
It establishes a Space Force and en-
sures that America retains its leader-
ship in this critical domain. It opens
the way for significant investments in
new weapons systems, such as
hypersonic missiles and directed en-
ergy weapons along with missile de-
fense and cyber security capabilities. It
also responds to concerns about family
housing across the Department of De-
fense.
Importantly, the bill continues to
provide for the modernization of our
nuclear forces. This legislation fully
authorizes fiscal year 2020 spending on
our nuclear deterrent, including sup-
port for all three legs of the Nation’s
nuclear triad. It also fully authorizes
the warhead life extension programs at
the Department of Energy.
I want to highlight a couple of
amendments I worked on and are in-
cluded in the legislation relative to
modernizing our nuclear triad. One of
the amendments that has been in-
cluded requires that the Air Force and
the National Nuclear Security Admin-
istration report to Congress on the de-
velopment of the next intercontinental
ballistic missile and the W87–1, which
is a modified warhead that will be
placed on the new ICBM for decades to
come.
It is vital that the Air Force’s mis-
sile development program, known as
the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent,
GBSD, be synchronized with the W87–1
warhead so that a decade from now, we
have a complete new weapons system
that is ready for deployment. My
amendment will help ensure that the
deployment will happen on schedule
and avoid unnecessary delays in that
development.
The other amendment highlights the
importance of our Nation’s ICBM force
and demonstrates how ICBMs enhance
deterrence as a part of the triad.
ICBMs provide the most prompt and
most dispersed segment of our nuclear
forces, and they magnify the deterrent
power of our nuclear triad.
I commend my colleagues for their
support of these amendments, which is
a strong statement of the continuing
importance of the ICBM and the need
to ensure that it is modernized along
with the rest of our nuclear forces in
order to keep us safe.
The bill is also critically important
for military activities in my home
State of North Dakota. Specifically, we
worked to secure a number of provi-
sions to support the missions at the
Minot Air Force Base, which is home
to two of the three legs of the nuclear
triad. Importantly, the NDAA author-
izes funding for B–52s, including the
procurement of new engines. As a
member of the Senate Defense Appro-
priations Committee, I have worked to
authorize and appropriate money for
new engines which will help modernize
the B–52 and extend its life for years to
come.
The NDAA also advances replace-
ment of the Vietnam-era Huey heli-
copters that provide security for the
missile fields, and it supports the con-
struction of a new helicopter facility at
Minot to house the Huey replacement.
It also makes a strong commitment to
the Long-Range Stand Off, LRSO, Pro-
gram that will provide a new nuclear
cruise missile for the B–52, as well as
continuing to advance the investments
in GBSD.
The bill also supports priorities at
Grand Forks Air Force Base, which is
home to the Global Hawk, which pro-
vides important intelligence, surveil-
lance, and reconnaissance capabilities
for the Air Force. In fact, it was the
Navy version of the Global Hawk which
was recently shot down in the Strait of
Hormuz by Iran.
The bill authorizes more than $240
million for the Global Hawk Program
and more than $115 million for the Bat-
tlefield Airborne Communications
Node that is carried on the Global
Hawk Block 20 aircraft. These invest-
ments in the Global Hawk have been a
priority because the Global Hawk
BACN system is urgently needed to
provide communications support for
operations around the world.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4601
June 27, 2019
Finally, I would like to emphasize
support for items that some of my col-
leagues put forward that I think are
critically important both for my State
and for the Nation as a whole.
I am pleased to cosponsor an amend-
ment from Senator GRAHAM that com-
mits us over the next decade to build-
ing our capacity to produce plutonium
pits. We must build up this capacity so
we can extend the life of our nuclear
stockpile and preserve our nuclear de-
terrent in the future.
I also cosponsored an amendment
from Senator MURKOWSKI that requires
the Defense Department to report on
Russian and Chinese activities in the
Arctic, which is an area of the world
where we need to build up our capabili-
ties in the coming years.
I would similarly express my support
for Senator HAWLEY’s amendment that
requires a report from our military
commanders on their ability to deter
aggressive actions from Russia and
China. I hope that can be included on
this legislation as well.
The bill also includes an important
provision from Senator KLOBUCHAR
that I cosponsored to help ensure that
the children of National Guard and Re-
serve servicemembers have access to
additional support services in schools.
I cosponsored a provision from Sen-
ator BALDWIN, who joins me on the
floor today, that will protect veterans’
benefits if and when they have to file
for bankruptcy. I am pleased to cospon-
sor her amendment.
All of these items demonstrate just
what a large undertaking the National
Defense Authorization Act really is. It
includes thousands of provisions and
represents a lot of work from many
Members in support of our military
servicemembers and their families.
I look forward to passing the legisla-
tion today and moving it to conference
and getting it enacted into law for our
men and women in uniform.
I yield the floor.

FOURTH OF JULY
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I
am so grateful we had the opportunity
to be on the floor this week and to
have a discussion about our Nation’s
security and how we protect and pre-
serve freedom. I have just a couple of
thoughts that I wanted to bring for-
ward as we begin to think about July
4th and Independence Day and how we
commemorate that day and do honor
to the heritage and the tradition of
that day and of the freedoms that we
enjoy.
I came across something this week
that I think is just so pertinent to our
discussions of this week as we focus on
freedom. In 1826, a very feeble and old
John Adams received a group of Quin-
cy, MA, town leaders. They were seek-
ing his help in planning an anniversary
celebration of the Declaration of Inde-
pendence. They wanted the former
President to pen a toast that would be
read at the event. Imagine their sur-
prise when what they got from John
Adams was two words. The toast that
he penned for them was simply this:
‘‘Independence forever.’’ It is what we
had fought for, what had been won,
what people had desired, and their pas-
sion—independence.
Keeping that independence is indeed
the task. I am certain they wanted
something much more ambitious and
eloquent, but they simply got the nug-
get of what centered him and what
should center us.
In the Declaration, our Founding Fa-
thers recognized that ‘‘Governments
long established should not be changed
for light and transient causes,’’ but
that true liberty could not thrive in
the grasp of tyranny.
Today, freedom reveals itself in the
lives and actions of every American,
and it is our responsibility to preserve
it on the battlefield and through our
actions each and every single day.
With every confirmation of a district
or a circuit court judge, we preserve an
essential right guaranteed by the First
Amendment—the right to petition the
government for a redress of grievances.
Earlier this month, I introduced a
resolution supporting free speech on
college campuses because it is beyond
distressing to hear students and their
professors argue that encouraging the
open exchange of ideas amounts to an
act of violence. Our Founding Fathers
probably never dreamed they would
hear of such a thing. This proud hos-
tility toward diversity of thought
should serve as a reminder that ques-
tions of freedom rarely remain settled.
Last week, famed economist Dr. Art
Laffer, who is a beloved Tennessean,
was awarded the Presidential Medal of
Freedom. The ‘‘father of supply-side
economics’’ only became so because he
was free to learn and apply the knowl-
edge that he gained to his own
groundbreaking work that led to the
Laffer curve.
Looking beyond Washington, it is
easy to see many more examples of
freedom in action each and every day.
Every Tuesday, my friend and fellow
Senator, LAMAR ALEXANDER, hosts
‘‘Tennessee Tuesday.’’ This gives us an
opportunity to meet with Tennesseans
who have come to Washington. They
are students, small businessmen, writ-
ers, and teachers. They have a host of
talents that they share, and they have
been allowed to invest in those talents.
Back home in Nashville, we enjoy the
artistry of some of the world’s most
talented songwriters, singers, and pro-
ducers. Guess what. In the United
States of America, they do not have to
go seek permission from any govern-
ment official to write a song about a
broken heart or any other act of injus-
tice that they want to write that song
about, sing that song about, or write
that screenplay about.
The connections we form with each
other—whether it be through art, song,
or a conversation at a cash register—
all run deep. The thoughts and emo-
tions we experience when confronted
with provocative ideas are just as
much a celebration of freedom as is a
flag-raising ceremony or a fireworks
display. This is why the very idea of
censorship or a global standard of
speech and association rouses imme-
diate dissent.
We know that these collective under-
standings regarding a particular type
of speech or behavior inevitably lead to
collective insistence that the problems
of the world could be resolved if only
we could agree to compromise on the
finer points of freedom. Those under-
standings assume that the intellectual
comfort of the many simply must, just
this once, override the ideas of the
vocal minority.
As we prepare to leave Washington in
anticipation of Independence Day, I
would encourage my friends in Con-
gress to challenge their own ideas of
what freedom looks like. How do they
exercise it and enjoy it every day?
While John Adams probably never
imagined a world of cable news and the
comments sections, he provided us
with the only context we need when
confronted with the choice of pre-
serving freedom or allowing it to slip
away—his admonition: ‘‘Independence
forever.’’
I yield the floor.

ator from Wisconsin.
ANNIVERSARY OF THE STONEWALL UPRISING
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise
today to mark the 50th anniversary of
a critical milestone in our Nation’s
march toward equality—the Stonewall
uprising of June 28, 1969.
The Stonewall Inn, which opened in
1967 on Christopher Street in Green-
wich Village in New York City, was one
of many establishments in cities across
this country that served as sanctuaries
for members of the LGBTQ community
from persecution by police and by soci-
ety at large.
In the late 1960s, every State in
America, save one, criminalized same-
sex relationships. Many State and local
governments also had harsh laws that
restricted the ability of transgender
people to express their identities, and
LGBTQ people were prohibited from
gathering socially. As a result, LGBTQ
individuals in places like Stonewall
Inn, where they gathered, were tar-
geted frequently by law enforcement,
including the New York City Police De-
partment. However, by the late 1960s,
LGBTQ individuals had already begun
to stand up to police harassment, in-
cluding at places like Cooper Do-nuts
in Los Angeles in 1959, Compton’s Cafe-
teria in San Francisco in 1966, and the
Black Cat Tavern in Los Angeles in
1967.
In the early morning hours of June
28, 1969, the NYPD raided the Stonewall
Inn and arrested several people, just as
it had done repeatedly over the days,
weeks, and months prior. But this
night was different. A few brave indi-
viduals—particularly transgender
women of color, like Marsha P. John-
son and Sylvia Riviera—stood up and

fought back against this injustice.
That night, they sparked an uprising
against the NYPD with confrontations
and protests at the Stonewall Inn and
the surrounding area that lasted over
the course of 6 days, until July 3, 1969.
The Stonewall uprising empowered
thousands of LGBTQ individuals to
emerge from shadows and to come out
publicly as they stood up for their com-
munity the night of June 28, 1969, and
beyond, putting their lives and their
safety at risk.
Along with public protests in Chi-
cago, Los Angeles, New York, Philadel-
phia, San Francisco, Washington, DC,
and elsewhere, the Stonewall uprising
became a catalyst for the LGBTQ civil
rights movement to secure social and
political equality and inspired the for-
mation of many advocacy organiza-
tions.
A year later, members of the LGBTQ
community commemorated the first
anniversary of Stonewall and re-
affirmed the solidarity of the commu-
nity by organizing the first Pride
marches and events in New York City,
San Francisco, Chicago, and Los Ange-
les.
Now, we remember and celebrate the
Stonewall uprising every year in June
as Pride Month.
Three years ago, President Obama
declared the Stonewall Inn and its sur-
rounding area a national monument,
becoming the first national monument
to commemorate the LGBTQ civil
rights movement.
Last month, New York City an-
nounced that it would dedicate a
monument honoring pioneering
transgender activists and key leaders
in the Stonewall uprising, including
Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Riviera.
It would be the first public monument
in the world honoring transgender
women.
Just a few weeks ago, the NYPD
Commissioner issued an official apol-
ogy on behalf of the department stat-
ing: ‘‘The actions taken by the NYPD
were wrong—plain and simple.’’
I was just a kid when the Stonewall
uprising happened. I didn’t hear about
Stonewall on the news or even learn
about it later in my history class. It
wasn’t until I was in college when, as a
part of my own coming out process, I
began to research the history of the
gay rights movement and I learned
more about the events at Stonewall,
the people involved, and the movement
that it created.
Five years after Stonewall, in 1974,
Kathy Kozachenko became the first
openly gay person elected to political
office in the United States, winning a
seat on the Ann Arbor City Council in
Michigan. Three years later, in 1977,
Harvey Milk was elected to the San
Francisco City Council.
In 1986, I had the honor of winning
election to the Dane County Board of
Supervisors in Madison, WI. It was my
first role in elected office, but I wasn’t
the first. In fact, I was the third openly
gay person to serve on the Dane Coun-
ty Board. I was really fortunate to
have role models who had come before
me.
In 1998, I became the first openly gay
person elected to the U.S. House of
Representatives as a nonincumbent,
and, in 2012, I became the first out
member of the LGBT community to be
elected to the U.S. Senate in its his-
tory.
I remember my early years in public
office when there were only about two
dozen or so elected officials who were
out across the country. We would meet
on an annual basis to discuss how we
could work together to exchange ideas
about legislation that would advance
equality, and we talked about how we
would help to expand our numbers at
the local, State, and national levels. I
am proud to say that, today, there are
more than 700 out LGBT people who
are serving in elected office across the
United States.
All of these public servants bring
their unique life experiences to the job,
and they give the LGBT community a
seat at the table of our local, State,
and Federal Governmental bodies. Per-
haps just as importantly, each of these
public servants is a role model for the
next generation. This is important
progress, but we are not there yet. We
have more work to do, and we must
keep fighting to move our country for-
ward.
Members of the LGBT community
continue to experience bias in policing
and are still at significant risk of vio-
lence and discrimination. According to
the annual hate crimes report, which is
published by the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation, LGBT individuals and,
particularly, LGBT individuals of color
continue to be the target of bias-moti-
vated violence, but efforts to address
this violence may be hindered by a con-
tinued lack of trust in law enforce-
ment. At least 100 transgender people,
primarily women of color, have been
murdered in the United States since
the beginning of 2015.
No LGBT person in the United States
should have to live in fear of being the
target of violence. In a majority of
States in this country, LGBT Ameri-
cans can still be fired, evicted from
their homes, or denied services because
of who they are or whom they love. Be-
cause there is no explicit, uniform Fed-
eral law protecting LGBT people from
discrimination in education, employ-
ment, housing, credit, and more, too
many Americans are at the mercy of
an inadequate patchwork of State and
local laws.
The House took a historic step for-
ward last month when it passed the
Equality Act. It is time for the Senate
to do the same so that all LGBT Amer-
icans, no matter where they live, can
finally have the freedom of full equal-
ity.
This week, I introduced a Senate res-
olution to honor the 50th anniversary
of the Stonewall uprising. It is the first
resolution in the U.S. Senate to recog-
nize the story of Stonewall. This reso-
lution commends the bravery, soli-
darity, and resiliency of the LGBT
community in the face of violence and
discrimination, both past and present.
It also condemns violence and discrimi-
nation against members of the LGBT
community and recommits to securing
justice, equality, and well-being for
LGBT people in our country. Stonewall
is the story of those who came before
us and let their voices be heard—of
those who bravely stood up and spoke
out so that others would not feel com-
pelled to live in silence or invisibly or
in secrecy.
When we look back at the Stonewall
uprising and the activism that grew
out of that moment, even the most
basic progress seemed as if it would
take a revolution to achieve—so we
had one. We should be proud of the
enormous progress that we have made
over the last 50 years. Let us remain
inspired by the courage of this story,
the story of Stonewall.
I yield the floor.

S. 1790
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, Con-
gress has no greater responsibility
than providing for a strong national
defense and keeping American citizens
safe.
The National Defense Authorization
Act is one of the most important pieces
of legislation to be considered by the
U.S. Senate. It authorizes the weapons
systems, programs, and resources that
support the men and women who serve
our country in the Armed Forces. For
decades, it has been approved with
strong, bipartisan support.
In my home State of Colorado, our
military installations, including Fort
Carson, the Air Force Academy, and
Buckley, Peterson, and Schriever Air
Force Bases, are on the cutting edge of
readiness in protecting our national se-
curity. This legislation is foundational
to their mission, their work, and our
show of support for the military.
I thank Chairman INHOFE and Rank-
ing Member REED for their bipartisan
leadership on the Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee and on the floor. The
tremendous responsibility of providing
for national defense cannot be over-
stated, and they have handled the proc-
ess with respect and the seriousness
that it deserves. The security of the
United States should always be more
important than any partisan politics,
and I appreciate their commitment
that they have placed on national de-
fense above all else.
I also thank my colleagues for their
bipartisan work on the National De-
fense Authorization Act. In working
with them, I was able to achieve a
number of great victories in amend-
ments for Colorado and the Nation as
well.

tisan amendment that will improve the

amendment that we were able to work
on.
I was able to work with Senator
TOOMEY and Senator VAN HOLLEN—
Senators from both sides of the aisle—
to impose sanctions on the murderous
North Korean regime.
We will also vote today to support a
bipartisan effort that I authored that
will encourage the U.S. Congress to
stand with the people of Hong Kong
and their democratic values while we
urge Hong Kong’s authorities to per-
manently withdraw their flawed extra-
dition bill and support human rights in
Hong Kong.
When one family member serves our
country in uniform, the entire family
serves. This legislation supports mili-
tary families in Colorado and all over
the world. It provides the largest pay
increase in a decade for troops, and it
continues to support military spouses.
The NDAA addresses the challenges
that servicemembers and their families
face when they live in privatized hous-
ing, and it expands resources to address
the PFAS water contamination in
many of our military communities.
This is an issue of life and health, and
it matters greatly to the people of Col-
orado. I was pleased to work with my
colleagues to continue addressing
PFAS contamination.
Of course, in Colorado, we are proud
to play a very key role in defending the
United States. These installations that
I talked about are critical to national
security and supporting our operations
in space. I am thrilled that this year’s
NDAA authorizes the U.S. Space Force
so that the United States can remain a
global leader in space and not fall be-
hind China or any other foreign com-
petitor.
Almost everything in today’s age re-
lies on space technology—tele-
communications, GPS, transportation
logistics, precision agriculture, and, of
course, the U.S. military. Establishing
the U.S. Space Force will better orga-
nize the military to handle space oper-
ations and will put all military mem-
bers who work in the space domain
under the same organizational um-
brella. Colorado is home to the North
American Aerospace Defense Command
and the U.S. Northern Command, and
it is the legacy home of the Air Force
Space Command. As we establish the
U.S. Space Force, Colorado is uniquely
positioned to continue its support of
our Nation’s military operations in
space and the mission set that space
involves.
We cannot risk falling behind our for-
eign competitors in the second space
age. In order to guarantee the safety
and security of American citizens, we
must maintain our leadership in space
operations and defense. I urge my col-
leagues to support the National De-
fense Authorization Act, which sup-
ports defense operations across the
globe and the brave women and men
who serve in the U.S. military. I will
always fight to protect and grow the
presence of the U.S. military in Colo-
rado and work to ensure that these
bases, which are essential to both na-
tional security and Colorado commu-
nities, remain strong.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma.
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to vitiate the yeas
and nays on the substitute amendment.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that I and Senator
JACK REED be given such time as we
shall consume prior to the vote that
will take place.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in just a
few minutes, the Senate will vote on
the final passage of the National De-
fense Authorization Act for fiscal year
2020.
Throughout the last week and a half,
we have debated the legislation here on
the Senate floor in a fair process. I
thank my colleagues who have sup-
ported this bill and have helped to
make a better bill through the amend-
ment process. While I would have liked
to have had more open amendments—
and Senator REED and I both wanted to
have more amendments on the floor—
we knew that there was a problem and
that we could not do that.
We are pleased that we will at least
be able to clear the 93 amendments
that we added on yesterday as part of
the bipartisan substitute amendment
in the manager’s package. These in-
clude the annual Intelligence Author-
ization Act, the Maritime Administra-
tion Authorization and Enhancement
Act, and the Fentanyl Sanctions Act.
Ultimately, the job of the NDAA is to
make tough choices about where we
want to invest our resources. We put
our resources where they matter—in
taking care of our people, in imple-
menting the national defense strategy,
and in applying recommendations from
the NDS Strategy Commission Report.
This is something we have used as a
blueprint, and it has been very success-
ful in taking us through this process.
Everyone agrees there are things
that are going to have to happen in
order to rebuild our military. That is
why our top line is $750 billion. With-
out that, we can’t achieve the goals
that we all know are necessary. It also
must happen as soon as possible. We
can’t delay on this bill.
We still have more work to be done
on the NDAA. We need to conference it.
The Conference Committee can some-
times take a little bit of time. We
know that is going to be done for us.
We know that we want to get this
thing done by our deadline, which
would be October 1.
In the month of July, we have to do
a lot of other things. We have to do an-
nual appropriations bills. We have to
do the budget deal. So these are some
of our most important responsibilities.
We have to get them done, and here is
why: Things are happening right now.
Two days ago, MSG Michael B. Riley
of Heilbronn, Germany, and SGT
James G. Johnston of Trumansburg,
NY, lost their lives in Afghanistan
while engaged in combat operations. It
was tragic.
Their service and sacrifice is a re-
minder of why this bill is so important.
We have to make sure our troops have
the very best of everything, and we are
in the process of getting there with
this bill.
Our prayers are with Master Ser-
geant Riley’s and Sergeant Johnston’s
families and loved ones. We will never
forget their service or their sacrifice
that they made, reminding us that
freedom is not free.
There is no doubt in my mind that
the NDAA we are about to pass will
give our troops what they need, make
American families safer, and enable to
us stand up for democratic values
around the world.
Let me single out and thank publicly
the next speaker, the ranking member,
Senator REED, for being a great partner
in this. We stayed together on this. We
had areas where we disagreed, but we
got around those, we got things done,
and the end result is a very good one.
I know Senator REED is going to
want to recognize, as I do, the signifi-
cance of the staff we worked with and
why that is so important. Of course, we
want to make sure people know—you
know, Senator REED and I get a lot of
credit for doing a lot of stuff that other
people do. We truly appreciate these
people.
Let me list some of them. First of
all, John Bonsell and Liz King from my
staff and from Senator REED’s staff.
They are the ones who really got in-
volved in this, and we feel, without
them, it would have been almost im-
possible—along with other people.
We had John Wason, Tom Goffus,
Stephanie Barna, Diem Salmon, Greg
Lilly, Marta Hernandez, Jennie Wright,
Adam Barker, Augusta Binns-Berkey,
Al Edwards, Jackie Kerber, Sean
O’Keefe, Tony Pankuch, Brad Patout,
Jason Potter, J.R. Riordan, Katie Sut-
ton, Eric Trager, Dustin Walker, Otis
Winkler, Gwyneth Woolwine, Katie
Magnus, Arthur Tellis, Leah Brewer,
Debbie Chiarello, Gary Howard, Tyler
Wilkinson, John Bryant, Patty-Jane
Geller, Baher Iskander, Keri-Lyn
Michalke, Jacqueline Modesett, and
Soleil Sykes.
I have a few more so just relax for a
minute.
I think the others are actually from
the minority side, and I am sure Sen-
ator REED is going to be recognizing
them.
From my personal staff, Luke Hol-
land, Andrew Forbes, Leacy Burke,
Don Archer, Kyle Stewart, and Bryan
Brody.
Lastly, from the floor staff, that is
Laura Dove, Robert Duncan, Chris
Tuck, Tony Hanagan, Katherine Kil-
roy, Brian Canfield, Abigail Baker, and
Megan Mercer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4604 June 27, 2019
All these people worked hard. They
are all a part of this team, and it cer-
tainly goes far beyond just Senator
REED and myself.
I yield the floor to Senator REED.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island.
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to
join Chairman INHOFE in support of the
fiscal year 2020 Defense authorization
bill. I thank the chairman for his great
bipartisan leadership, thoughtful, sen-
sible, and delivering what I think is an
excellent piece of legislation.
It was based on thorough hearings,
discussions, and debate on both sides of
the aisle, and it came out of the com-
mittee with strong bipartisan support.
I hope it enjoys that support on final
passage.
As the chairman indicated, the bill
provides for many different aspects
that are necessary to our national de-
fense. It provides a pay raise for the
men and women of our Armed Forces
who do so much for us. It includes over
30 provisions to address the privatized
military housing crisis. It authorizes
military construction in almost every
State in this country. It provides fund-
ing and authorities for our military
personnel on the frontlines and for
those who are back in the United
States building the ships and the tanks
and advancing the technologies we
need for the future fight.
This bill also contains numerous
amendments from many of my col-
leagues, again, on both sides of the
aisle, on other issues of great impor-
tance, such as the Intelligence Author-
ization Act, the authorization of the
Maritime Administration, and provi-
sions addressing the fentanyl crisis and
the dangers of PFOS-PFAS in our
water.
There are numerous provisions here
that go beyond the narrow definition of
the defense establishment. They are bi-
partisan, and they are strongly sup-
ported by both sides of the aisle.
Again, let me thank Senator INHOFE
for his leadership. It made a great dif-
ference in terms of his approach to this
important legislation.
Finally, I would like to thank the
committee staff. Particularly, I would
like to thank the majority staff and
their staff director, John Bonsell. He
did a superb job—they did. ‘‘Diligence,’’
‘‘professionalism,’’ and ‘‘bipartisan-
ship’’ were the watchwords of their ef-
forts. I thank them for that.
Let me thank my staff. In particular,
Jody Bennett, Carolyn Chuhta, Jon
Clark, Jonathan Epstein, Jorie Feld-
man, Creighton Greene, Ozge Guzelsu,
Gary Leeling, Kirk McConnell, Maggie
McNamara, Bill Monahan, Mike
Noblet, John Quirk, Arun Seraphin,
Fiona Tomlin, and my staff director,
Elizabeth King, who, with John
Bonsell, did a superb job.
Let me thank the floor staff who
have helped us over the last few days
immensely.
I urge all of my colleagues to join the
chairman and me in supporting this ex-
cellent legislation.
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

The Senator from Rhode Island.
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise
today to discuss the escalating ten-
sions between the United States and
Iran, my concern about the administra-
tion’s current approach—a path that I
am worried will lead us to war—and my
support for the Udall amendment to
the NDAA, which will be voted on to-
morrow.
I believe that diplomatic efforts, in
concert with our international part-
ners, should be pursued immediately to
avoid another unnecessary armed con-
flict in the Middle East.
Let me be clear. Iran is a dangerous
and destabilizing force in the region. It
supports terrorist proxies and meddles
in the internal affairs of other states.
Iran continues to pursue ballistic mis-
sile capabilities in violation of inter-
national norms and abuses the rights
of its own people. Unfortunately, the
administration’s chosen course of ac-
tion with respect to Iran has isolated
the United States from the inter-
national community and made it more
difficult to collectively address these
issues.
The administration’s actions and
rhetoric related to Iran have created a
credibility deficit. This is a fast-chang-
ing and dangerous situation, and it is
clear that there is not a consensus
within the international community
with respect to Iran’s plans and inten-
tions.
Given these disconnects, it is impera-
tive for the administration to provide
Congress with current, unvarnished in-
telligence so that we may reach sub-
stantiated conclusions.
Taking a step back, it is important
to recount the actions that have pre-
cipitated the current state of affairs.
Current tensions are an entirely pre-
dictable outcome of the administra-
tion’s ill-conceived approach to Iran.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4605
June 27, 2019
Despite then-Candidate Trump’s cam-
paign rhetoric, I and others hoped that
he would heed the advice of the advis-
ers with respect to the Iran nuclear
agreement, also known as the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action, or the
JCPOA.
For example, despite personal con-
cerns about the JCPOA before it was
signed, former Secretary of Defense
Mattis told the Armed Services Com-
mittee at his confirmation hearing
that ‘‘when America gives her word, we
have to live up to it and work with our
allies.’’
In October 2017, Secretary Mattis
told the Armed Services Committee
that he believed it was in our national
interest to remain in the JCPOA. Gen-
eral Dunford, Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, echoed these senti-
ments at the time and cautioned that,
in his words, ‘‘the U.S. will incur dam-
age vis-a-vis our allies if we unilater-
ally withdraw from the JCPOA. Our al-
lies will be less likely to cooperate
with us on future military action to
prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear
weapon and less likely to cooperate
with us on countering other desta-
bilizing aspects of Iranian behavior
that threaten our collective interests.’’
The administration should have
sought to work with the international
community to address the challenges
posed by Iran by building upon the
foundation of the JCPOA rather than
squandering that opportunity in favor
of ‘‘putting Iran on notice’’ and other
inflammatory rhetoric.
Just over a year ago, President
Trump made the disastrous decision to
unilaterally withdraw the United
States from the JCPOA and reimpose
nuclear-related sanctions, in violation
of previous U.S. commitments under
the deal. Since withdrawing from the
deal, the Trump administration has
taken a series of additional escalatory
actions, including the imposition of
new sanctions on various aspects of the
Iranian economy; cancellation of waiv-
ers that previously allowed importa-
tion of Iranian oil by China, India,
Japan, South Korea, and Turkey; and
the designation of the Iranian Revolu-
tionary Guards Corps—often referred
to as the IRGC—as a foreign terrorist
organization.
The designation of a foreign govern-
ment entity as a foreign terrorist orga-
nization was unprecedented, and it is
not clear what purpose it served other
than to unnecessarily raise tensions
with Iran. As I learned during a recent
visit to Iraq and Afghanistan, the IRGC
designation has significantly com-
plicated our relationships with foreign
partners who described the action as
provocative and destabilizing.
While the JCPOA was not a perfect
deal, it was a necessary deal. It is im-
portant to remember that when the
JCPOA was signed, Iran’s ‘‘breakout’’
timeline—the amount of time Iran
would need to produce enough fissile
material for a nuclear weapon—was
only 2 to 3 months. Even by the most
conservative estimates, the JCPOA
stretched that timeline to more than a
year.
By all accounts, the JCPOA has
worked as intended. The JCPOA com-
mits Iran to never seeking to develop
or acquire a nuclear weapon and effec-
tively cuts off all pathways for Iran to
achieve a nuclear weapon until at least
2030. The agreement dramatically re-
duced Iran’s stockpile of enriched ura-
nium and the number of installed cen-
trifuges. It also prevented Iran from
producing weapons-grade plutonium
and has subjected Iran to the most in-
trusive monitoring regime in the world
to ensure it is living up to its commit-
ments.
The JCPOA was appropriately built
upon the concept of ‘‘distrust and
verify,’’ and I support efforts by our
European partners, as well as Russia
and China, to preserve the JCPOA de-
spite challenges the Trump administra-
tion has put in their way.
According to General Dunford, in the
absence of the JCPOA, Iran would like-
ly resume its nuclear weapons pro-
gram, and, in his words, ‘‘a nuclear-
armed Iran would likely be more ag-
gressive in its actions and more dan-
gerous in its consequences.’’
Unfortunately, the administration’s
withdrawal from the agreement and re-
imposition of sanctions has left us iso-
lated from our allies and partners
while emboldening the hardliners in
Iran.
In May of last year, subsequent to
the decision to withdraw from the
JCPOA, Secretary of State Pompeo ar-
ticulated a set of 12 ‘‘demands’’ and in-
dicated that ‘‘major changes’’ would
need to be made by Iran before sanc-
tions relief would be provided. The ad-
ministration has sent mixed messages
on whether its demands should be
viewed as a set of preconditions for dis-
cussions on sanctions relief. The de-
mands outlined by Secretary Pompeo
are widely viewed as maximalist and
leave little room for negotiation, espe-
cially given that the administration
has already reneged on previous diplo-
matic commitments related to Iran’s
nuclear program.
Without greater certainty by the ad-
ministration on what specific actions
would need to be taken by Iran to re-
lieve U.S. economic pressure, I fear
that Iran has little incentive to engage
in negotiations.
Indeed, the administration has fol-
lowed that initial set of 12 demands
with a succession of orchestrated steps
to force Iran into an ever-smaller cor-
ner that only serves to increase the
odds of miscalculation and reduce dip-
lomatic opportunities. The economic
sanctions by the United States have
left the Iranian economy reeling, with
its gross domestic product shrinking
by 5 percent and the inflation rate ris-
ing by 50 percent.
As part of this so-called ‘‘Maximum
Pressure’’ campaign, the administra-
tion has just announced personal sanc-
tions against Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei and other Iranian leader-
ship. The Iranians have responded by
indicating that these sanctions mean
‘‘the permanent closure of the doors of
diplomacy.’’
Rather than modifying its behavior,
Iran has responded to these demands
and subsequent escalatory actions by
increasing its malign activities in the
region, including in Yemen and Syria,
and announcing that it would stop
complying with certain aspects of the
JCPOA. If Iran follows through on
threats to completely withdraw from
the JCPOA and resume nuclear weap-
ons development activities, the United
States and the international commu-
nity will be in a much less unified and
therefore weaker negotiating position
than we had leading up to the JCPOA.
As I assess the current state of af-
fairs, I see four potential outcomes of
the current approach being pursued by
the administration.
First, Iran could bend to the will of
the administration and announce its
compliance with the so-called 12 de-
mands laid out by Secretary Pompeo.
However, Iran has a long history of
struggle against outside forces. A nota-
ble example is the Iran-Iraq war of the
1980s. Additionally, Iranian capitula-
tion would likely threaten its top pri-
ority of regime survival, so clearly this
is an unrealistic outcome.
Second, Iran could remain in the
JCPOA despite seeing little of the eco-
nomic benefits promised by the deal
and hope that a future U.S. administra-
tion would return to the agreement.
Iran’s recent announcement that it
would stop complying with aspects of
the JCPOA is a signal that it views the
current arrangement as unsustainable
and is willing to abandon the JCPOA
completely if its economic situation
does not improve in the near term.
Third, Iran could agree to return to
the negotiating table, seeking a reduc-
tion in tensions and easing of sanc-
tions. However, both the administra-
tion and Iranian leaders have made
clear that they are not interested in
such an approach.
In announcing the administration’s
strategy for Iran last May, Secretary
Pompeo stated that President Trump is
‘‘ready, willing, and able to negotiate a
new deal’’ but also made clear that ‘‘we
will not renegotiate the JCPOA itself.’’
On May 8, Iranian President Rouhani
stated:
We are ready to negotiate, within the
boundaries of JCPOA. . . . It is not us who
left the negotiation table.
These seem to be irreconcilable posi-
tions, especially after the latest round
of sanctions directed at the Iranian
leadership.
Lastly and most significant, I be-
lieve, the current approach could result
in a military conflict between the
United States and Iran. The destruc-
tion of an American unmanned drone
flying in international airspace by a
missile fired from Iran is an example of
the potential for widespread conflict.
Only at the last minute did President

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4606 June 27, 2019
Trump call off a strike against the Ira-
nian missile sites in retaliation. He
concluded correctly that such a strike
would be disproportionate. But the in-
cident underscores the precarious posi-
tion we are in after months of the mis-
guided ‘‘maximum pressure’’ campaign.
Iranian action, either directed by na-
tional leadership or mistakenly taken
by zealous supporters, could put us on
an escalatory ladder of strike and
counterstrike that would involve the
entire region from Afghanistan to the
Levant.
In addition and equally troubling is
that an unarticulated goal of this so-
called ‘‘Maximum Pressure’’ campaign
is to prompt Iran to leave the JCPOA
either officially or by gradually in-
creasing its stock of highly enriched
uranium or other aspects of its nuclear
program. This could give advocates for
a military strike on Iran increased le-
verage. Again, such a strike, even tar-
geted to nuclear facilities, would likely
prompt a regional asymmetric response
by Iran, with significant military as
well as economic consequences.
Like all of my colleagues, I am deep-
ly concerned about Iranian threats to
U.S. personnel facilities in the Middle
East. U.S. forces have the unquestioned
and inherent right to defend them-
selves, but absent an Iranian directed
or sponsored attack or the imminent
threat of such an attack on U.S. per-
sonnel facilities or key strategic inter-
ests, military actions should be pur-
sued only as a last resort and as part of
an international coalition, which the
administration has so far failed to
bring together.
I will be supporting the amendment
offered by Senator UDALL because it
would make clear that any offensive
military action against Iran must be
consistent with domestic and inter-
national law, including a specific au-
thorization for the use of military
force, or an AUMF, provided by Con-
gress.
In this context, the President’s dem-
onstrated willingness not just to bend
the facts but to indulge, in certain
cases, in fabrications is particularly
concerning and unacceptable when it
may come to deploying our troops into
harm’s way. Congress has the responsi-
bility to demand and, if necessary,
challenge the basis for unsupported as-
sertions of Iranian aggression and
provocation that could be used to take
this country to war.
Echoing one of the themes used in
the Bush administration’s justification
for the 2003 Iraq war, Secretary of
State Pompeo testified to the Senate
in April that ‘‘there’s no doubt there is
a connection between the Islamic Re-
public of Iran and al Qaeda. Period.
Full stop.’’ And he refused to rule out
the use of the 2001 AUMF as a means to
conduct military action against Iran.
While Iran is a state sponsor of ter-
ror, I am not aware of compelling evi-
dence to suggest Iran or Iranian affili-
ated groups are an ‘‘associated force’’
of al-Qaida for the purposes of the 2001
AUMF.
In fact, such an arrangement is hard
to fathom, given the deep religious and
ideological differences between the
Shia leadership of Iran and the Sunni
leadership of al-Qaida. The administra-
tion must come to Congress if it seeks
to pursue offensive military action.
Likewise, any consideration of mili-
tary action against Iran must fully ac-
count for the likely cost of such an en-
gagement—in lives, resources, poten-
tial negative impact on the global
economy, disruption of U.S. bilateral
relationships, and other unintended
consequences. The administration
must provide the American people with
a clear-eyed assessment of what those
costs may be in advance of any con-
templated military engagement.
The Trump administration’s
escalatory attacks may soon place Iran
in an untenable position. As a result,
Iran may seek to change the status quo
by initiating a limited military con-
flict with the United States, thereby
requiring the intervention of the inter-
national community. If such a scenario
comes to pass, our recent efforts to
deter Iran through the deployment of
additional military capabilities to the
region will have failed, and even a lim-
ited conflict would be very difficult to
manage or to bring to a conclusion.
The President and others in the ad-
ministration have consistently
downplayed the potential costs of con-
flict with Iran. In fact, just yesterday,
the President said that ‘‘if something
should happen [with Iran], we’re in a
very strong position. It wouldn’t last
very long.’’ The President’s assessment
is undercut by his own Director of Na-
tional Intelligence Dan Coats, who told
Congress earlier this year:
Iran continues to develop and approve a
range of new military capabilities to target
U.S. and allied military assets in the region,
including armed UAVs, ballistic missiles, ad-
vanced naval mines, unmanned explosive
boats, submarines and advanced torpedoes,
and antiship and land-attack cruise missiles.
Iran has the largest ballistic missile force in
the Middle East and can strike targets up to
2,000 kilometers from Iran’s borders. Russia’s
delivery of the SA–20c SAM system in 2016
has provided Iran with its most advanced
long-range air defense system.
In addition to the conventional mili-
tary capabilities laid out by Director
Coats, Iran maintains a network of
proxy forces throughout the region,
many of whom operate in close prox-
imity to U.S. military personnel in
Iraq and Syria. They maintain the ca-
pability to conduct lethal action
against our forces and facilities with-
out notice.
Recently retired commander of the
U.S. Central Command, General Votel,
told the Armed Services Committee in
February:
The Iranian regime masks its malign ac-
tivities through proxies and surrogates en-
abled by the Iran Threat Network in Yemen,
Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon. Iran is also at-
tempting to build ground lines of commu-
nication through Iraq and Syria into Leb-
anon to support its proxy Hezbollah. Iran has
gained influence with Iraq’s armed forces
with the formalization of Popular Mobiliza-
tion Forces, and also exerted influence in
Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen, oftentimes af-
fecting established sovereign governments.
The combination of Iran’s known
conventional and asymmetric capabili-
ties should dispel any notion that con-
flict with Iran would be quick or could
be won only through the use of U.S. air
power. As former Secretary of Defense
Robert Gates reportedly said in a re-
cent speech: ‘‘If you think the war in
Iraq was hard, an attack on Iran would,
in my opinion, be a catastrophe.’’
He continued: ‘‘[Iranian] capacity to
wage a series of terror attacks across
the Middle East aimed at us and our
friends, and dramatically worsen the
situation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Leb-
anon, and elsewhere is hard to overesti-
mate.’’
All of the competent military ana-
lysts I have engaged with believe that
we cannot conduct an effective land
campaign in Iran, and an extended air
and sea campaign will undercut the
priorities laid out in the national de-
fense strategy, which focuses not on
the Middle East but on Russia and
China.
Absent the full mobilization of our
Armed Forces and those of our allies,
ground operations in Iran are simply
beyond our capacity. The last ground
war involving Iran, the Iran-Iraq war of
the 1980s, resulted in the death of near-
ly 1 million troops, the majority of
whom were Iranians who died fighting
a superior Iraqi military during a bru-
tal and prolonged conflict. There is
clearly no widespread U.S. or inter-
national support for another such mili-
tary engagement in the Middle East.
Considering the costs associated with
ground operations, a more limited con-
flict involving a series of tit-for-tat ac-
tions is far more likely, with Iran uti-
lizing its asymmetric advantages and
proxies in response to U.S. precision
and standoff strikes.
It is unlikely that U.S. deterrence
could be quickly reestablished under
such a scenario, and Iran may use the
time to restart and advance its nuclear
weapons efforts, thereby increasing its
negotiating leverage and also making
the situation much more volatile.
War with Iran is not inevitable. To
date, the administration has tried to
use every instrument of national power
to get Iran to change its behavior—ex-
cept diplomacy and negotiations. The
administration’s ill-conceived ap-
proach has not worked, and the time
has come to try real and sustained di-
plomacy, rather than relying on coer-
cion.
I urge the President and those in the
administration to take this moment of
high tension to engage with our allies
and partners with the goal of seeking a
diplomatic solution to the current situ-
ation. In that context and in that spir-
it, I will support the Udall amendment
tomorrow.
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4607
June 27, 2019
BORDER SECURITY
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the
116th Congress, so far, has just talked
about the humanitarian crisis at the
border. Most of our Democratic col-
leagues have claimed up to this point
that there is no crisis or emergency at
the border.
We will recall that we started out the
year with a government shutdown be-
cause of the battle over border secu-
rity, and our Democratic friends made
one thing perfectly clear: They would
oppose any effort to fund our security
mission at the border. That resulted in
the 35-day shutdown.
The Speaker of the House at the time
called the situation ‘‘a fake crisis at
the border,’’ and the minority leader
here in the Senate referred it to as ‘‘a
crisis that does not exist.’’ Well, they
weren’t the only ones. Throughout the
Halls of the Capitol, Democrats in Con-
gress used terms like ‘‘phony,’’ ‘‘imagi-
nary,’’ and ‘‘make-believe’’ to describe
the challenges our frontline officers
and agents were facing every day.
While our Democratic colleagues
have reflexively denied the existence of
a crisis at the border, the problems
have grown only bigger each day. Of
course, it was 2014, I will remind my
friends across the aisle, when Barack
Obama, then President of the United
States, declared a humanitarian and
security crisis at the border. So it
seemed very odd to me that, in 2019,
they decided—when the numbers kept
getting bigger and bigger and condi-
tions worse and worse—all of a sudden
that the humanitarian and security
crisis had gone away.
The fact is, over the last 3 months,
the number of illegal crossings across
the southwestern border have hit six
figures, something we haven’t seen
since 2006. We surpassed the number of
unaccompanied children apprehended
at the height of the 2014 crisis that
President Obama was speaking about.
This mass migration has nearly de-
pleted our Federal resources, causing
the President to request $41⁄2 billion for
humanitarian assistance and border op-
erations. That request came almost 2
months ago—almost 2 months ago, and
Congress has not acted.
Now, it seems, our Democratic col-
leagues have finally accepted the facts.
There is a very real and very urgent
humanitarian crisis on our southern
border. The bill they passed earlier this
week meets the dollar amount re-
quested by the President, but the sub-
stance of the bill shows that House
Democrats don’t want to send funding
where it is actually needed the most.
Unlike the Senate’s bipartisan bill,
the original House bill excluded fund-
ing for the Department of Defense, im-
migration judge teams, and under-
funded both Immigration and Customs
Enforcement and Customs and Border
Protection. This morning, they made a
last-ditch effort to inject some of their
deeply partisan provisions back into
our Senate bipartisan bill. While the
House Democrats did increase needed
funding in some areas, the newly
amended version still includes divisive
provisions and reduces funding in areas
that the Senate overwhelmingly re-
jected yesterday.
Here is just one example. Democrats
in the House cut the Senate bill’s ap-
propriation of $21 million for ICE
Homeland Security investigations to
conduct—get this—human trafficking
investigations. So the House wanted to
cut $21 million in the Senate appropria-
tions bill that was dedicated to inves-
tigating human trafficking. This is just
the latest example of their funda-
mental lack of interest in sending
money where it is needed most—only
where it is politically convenient.
It is unfortunately not much of a sur-
prise. Our Democratic friends are try-
ing to keep up with their candidates
running for President, whose positions
on immigration and border security get
more extreme each day. Now, more
than one Democrat running for the
nomination for President actually sup-
ports making entering the country ille-
gally legal—in other words, no orderly
immigration system at all—a free-for-
all, where it is easier for human traf-
fickers and drug smugglers to come
and go as they please. And, of course,
there is this: no consideration given for
those would-be immigrants who are
trying to wait patiently in line and do
things exactly the right way and no
consideration of the unfairness of those
who would jump ahead of the line and
enter the country illegally before those
who are trying to do it the right way.
The House bill stands in stark con-
trast to the bipartisan agreement we
passed here in the Senate, which funds
a range of programs at the Federal de-
partments and agencies working to
manage the crisis, and, importantly, it
is the only bill in town that has the
support of the President. It is, after all,
important to get the President’s signa-
ture on legislation for it to become
law.
The Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee overwhelmingly supported this
bill, and it passed the committee by a
vote of 30 to 1. When the full Senate
voted on it yesterday, only eight Mem-
bers of the Senate voted no.
We have simply waited long enough.
We waited too long, in my view, for
Democrats to acknowledge this real
humanitarian crisis. The House bill is
inadequate and mostly a partisan ef-
fort.
Our Democratic colleagues have re-
sisted acting for far too long already,
making this humanitarian crisis worse.
They circulate the very tragic pictures
of a father with his young child face
down in the waters of the Rio Grande
River, and they somehow fail to ac-
knowledge their own complicity in fail-
ing to act to provide the sorts of fixes
to our asylum laws that would deter, if
not prevent, that sort of thing from oc-
curring in the first place. They really
do need to look in the mirror.
We need to take action now, and I
hope we don’t have to wait any longer
for our colleagues in the House to pass
the Senate’s bipartisan bill.
f
S. 1790
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on an-
other note, I listened with great inter-
est as the ranking member of the Sen-
ate Armed Services Committee, the
Senator from Rhode Island, spoke
about Iran and the challenges we face
there. I agree with some and maybe
even most of what he had to say.
The American people were appalled
when, last week, Iran took down an un-
manned American aircraft over inter-
national waters. As the Senator said,
ordinarily, Iran operates by proxies or
by third parties, whether it is the Shia
militia in Iraq or Hezbollah or one of
their other terrorist proxies like those
operating in Yemen, the Houthis. But
Iran escalated its attack against the
United States by shooting an un-
manned drone flying over international
waters, so it was quite a shocking
move from that standpoint, even from
a nation as untethered as Iran.
Iran has been engaged in a 30-year
conflict with the United States, one
that has resulted in the death of U.S.
servicemembers in Iraq and else-
where—victims of explosively formed
penetrators and other training that the
IRGC, the Iranian Revolutionary
Guard, their Quds Force, their Special
Operations force—the training they
gave to terrorists operating in Iraq to
kill Americans.
Then there is the periodic harass-
ment of American and other inter-
national vessels operating in the Strait
of Hormuz, a narrow strait through
which a huge portion of the world’s en-
ergy supplies flow. So this is, in some
ways, an escalation of what has been a
30-year conflict between Iran and the
United States.
Tehran has waged acts of aggression
against the United States and our al-
lies. It has exported terrorism around
the globe. It is the No. 1 state sponsor
of international terrorism, and it has
engaged in gross human rights viola-
tions against its own people.
As I indicated, Iran’s Islamic Revolu-
tionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, is the
loyal henchman responsible for leading
these acts. It is a branch of Iran’s
Armed Forces which tries to squash de-
mocracy movements at home and
abroad by pushing its extreme ideology
beyond Iran’s borders.
The Islamic Revolutionary Guard
Corps wields vast power and influence
and uses its capabilities to encourage
turmoil and conflict and violence
throughout the Middle East. It funds
arms, training, and foot soldiers to the
terrorist groups that spread their rad-
ical ideology.
While the terrorist activities alone
are enough to cause concern, the IRGC
is also in control of Iran’s ballistic mis-
sile program, which unfortunately has
only accelerated under the previous ad-
ministration’s deeply flawed nuclear
deal, known as the Joint Comprehen-
sive Plan of Action, the JCPOA. Once

we saw the details of that deal in 2015,
it quickly became clear that it was not
much of a deal at all. If the goal is to
prevent Iran from getting a nuclear
weapon—well, it obviously failed in
that goal.
As the majority leader said at the
time, it ‘‘appears to fall well short of
the goal we all thought was trying to
be achieved, which was that Iran would
not be a nuclear state.’’
Despite the restrictions it would im-
pose, the deal would leave Iran with a
vast nuclear program and allow it to
continue to conduct research and de-
velopment on advanced centrifuges and
building intercontinental ballistic mis-
siles.
Perhaps worse, the nuclear deal
would lift those restrictions in a dec-
ade. In other words, it was 2015 when
the JCPOA was signed by the relevant
parties. So by postponing Iran’s ability
to develop a nuclear weapon, we are al-
ready half of the way there almost. It
is no wonder that then-Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu deliv-
ered an address to Congress in March of
2015 and said the JCPOA ‘‘doesn’t block
Iran’s path to the bomb; it paves Iran’s
path to the bomb.’’ That certainly
seems to be the case. We have seen Iran
violate the nuclear deal and U.N. reso-
lutions time after time, and it is clear
that their resolve to create nuclear
weapons remains their highest pri-
ority.
Just a year ago, President Trump an-
nounced the United States would pull
out of the nuclear deal, a decision I
strongly supported. Even at the time
Secretary Kerry, the Secretary of
State, admitted that the tens of bil-
lions of dollars the United States re-
leased to go to Iran would be used to
fund their terrorist activities, he sup-
ported it nonetheless. He supported it
even though it paved the way for Iran
to get a nuclear weapon 10 years after
the JCPOA was signed.
Since the Trump administration has
withdrawn from the JCPOA, it has
taken resolute action against Iran, in-
cluding stronger sanctions on entities
and individuals and the designation of
the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organi-
zation, which it clearly is. Somehow,
though, despite the unprovoked at-
tacks, flagrant violations of inter-
national agreements, and human rights
violations, some of our friends on the
left and the mainstream media have
grossly mischaracterized the situation
and have somehow managed to point
the finger at the Trump administration
for starting the fight in the first place.
They want to blame America, and they
want to blame this administration.
Let me be clear. Iran is the aggres-
sor. Their history as the chief mischief-
maker in the Middle East began long
before President Trump took office, so
don’t lay this at his feet. From the
Iran hostage crisis to their outright
support of terrorist groups in the Mid-
dle East, to this latest strike at a U.S.
aircraft, something they admitted—
they said: We did it—their actions at
every turn have demonstrated a desire
not only to escalate the conflict with
the United States and our interests and
allies but to spread their violent extre-
mism without regard for anyone else.
I have to say it has been 74 years
since a nuclear weapon was exploded
during World War II, and I hope and
pray there is never again a nuclear
weapon exploded on our planet, but can
you imagine Iran, the No. 1 state spon-
sor of international terrorism, getting
a nuclear weapon? We can never ever
allow that to happen.
This last week marked the 23rd anni-
versary of a notable episode in Iran’s
sad history of terrorism. That was the
23rd anniversary of the Khobar Towers
bombing in Saudi Arabia. In 1996, a
truck bomb was detonated adjacent to
a building housing members of the U.S.
Air Force’s 4404th Wing, killing 19 U.S.
Air Force personnel and a Saudi local
and wounding 498 others.
If Tehran expects to continue export-
ing terrorism and violence around the
world without a response from the
United States and our allies, they are
sorely mistaken.
If Iran can continue to escalate with
no response from the United States or
our allies, they are going to continue
to escalate as much as they can, which
I think is more dangerous than a pro-
portional U.S. response to what hap-
pened in the Strait of Hormuz.
The President has opted for hard-hit-
ting sanctions, which I think are a
good start. Those sanctions announced
by the administration earlier this week
represent an appropriate response to
the Iranian escalation consistent with
President Trump’s maximum pressure
strategy on Iran. These sanctions will
deny the Supreme Leader, the Supreme
Leader’s office, and close affiliates ac-
cess to resources they need to finance
their rogue regime. There is no ben-
efit—in the interest of peace—to apply-
ing anything less than maximum pres-
sure on Iran to change their behavior.
The tentacles of the IRGC run deep
into their economy, and these sanc-
tions will prevent them from amassing
even greater power to develop sophisti-
cated weapons.
We have seen reports that the eco-
nomic challenges they are encoun-
tering as a result of the sanctions al-
ready in place are making it harder for
them to finance their terrorist oper-
ations through their proxy.
The actions taken by Iran show that
they are feeling the squeeze of these
sanctions, and they know exactly what
they need to do before they can get re-
lief. As Secretary of State Pompeo
said, ‘‘When the Iranian regime decides
to forgo violence and meet our diplo-
macy with diplomacy, it knows how to
reach us.’’
I sincerely hope to see the day when
the Iranian people can live without
fear, when their government respects
its own citizens and international al-
lies and lives by international norms
and finally decides to forgo its nuclear
weapons. Until that day comes, I hope
our allies will stand with us in con-
fronting the tyrants in Iran and doing
everything in our power to push back
against the world’s largest state spon-
sor of terror.
I yield the floor.

S. 1790
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President,
tomorrow this body faces an oppor-
tunity, in fact, an obligation to re-
assert its proper constitutional role in
warmaking.
I urge my colleagues to support the
Udall-Kaine amendment, a provision to
prohibit funding for unauthorized and
unapproved military operations
against Iran. No vote will be more im-
portant during this session than the
one we cast tomorrow. It is not only
the imminence of potential conflict, it
is the reality that we would be surren-
dering our proper constitutional re-
sponsibility and our right if we fail to
adopt this amendment. The American
people already believe we have ceded
too much authority to the executive
branch; that we are implicitly, if not
directly and explicitly, approving an
imperial presence. This amendment
puts us to the test before the American
people.
The Congress has a job to do. We
should do that job tomorrow. We
should insist that we have the author-
ity and we have the obligation to con-
sider whether there are military oper-
ations against Iran.
We can talk about policy. There is no
question that Iran is a malign and
treacherously bad actor in that part of
the world. There is no doubt that it
poses a clear and present jeopardy to
the world community. Iran may well
have installed mines on the two tank-
ers that were severely damaged re-
cently and may well be the culprit in
shooting down an American drone in
the past week, but the United States is
on a perilous course. We are on a dan-
gerous course toward continued esca-
lation and possible miscalculation that
may create a spiral of uncontrollable
military responses.
It isn’t that we have a dangerous pol-
icy, it is that we have no policy, no
strategy, no endgame articulated by
the President of the United States or
anyone in this administration. To re-
sort to military action rather than re-
liance on diplomatic approaches is a
recipe for potential disaster.
This unintended escalation could re-
sult from more miscalculation or it
could result from purposeful desire on
one side or both sides among a small
number of advisers or military leaders
that there be a resort to kinetic activ-
ity, but we have, in the meantime, an
opportunity to resort to diplomacy, to
enlist our allies and partners. This sit-
uation is the result of our putting
those allies, in part, in an extraor-
dinarily difficult position.
The current tensions with Iran today
are the direct result of President

June 27, 2019
Trump’s ill-conceived policy toward
Iran ever since he carelessly and reck-
lessly discarded the Iran nuclear deal
last year. His approach to foreign pol-
icy has been indecisive and chaotic,
and that is partly the reason why ten-
sions have escalated with an adversary
rather than preserving key nuclear
agreements and engaging in diplomacy.
We must now deescalate and resort
to diplomacy. Even if one disagrees
with that point, puts aside the Presi-
dent’s bellicose and bullying rhetoric,
and even if there is the thought that
Iran is solely and completely respon-
sible for this situation, the United
States should not engage in military
operations without the authorization
of Congress. Yes, it may defend against
or deter an immediate attack that is so
urgent that defense of the country has
to be undertaken by the Commander in
Chief. But this Senate should prevent
the President from entering and start-
ing and engaging in another war in the
Middle East under the misguided idea
that there is a 2001 authorization that
allows him to do so legally.
Let me be perfectly clear. A failure
of the prohibition funding amendment
we will consider tomorrow is not itself
an authorization for the President to
wage war with Iran. The Constitution
trumps any statute. The Constitution
requires action by Congress. Without
congressional authorization and any-
thing short of specific authority for
declaration of war from Congress,
starting or waging a war with Iran
would be unconstitutional.
But the NDAA on the floor this week
is an opportune time—in fact, a perfect
opportunity—for Congress to reassert
its constitutional authority over the
role of the declaration of war. We must
seize this moment. We can’t simply
allow or rely on the outdated 2001 au-
thorization for the use of military
force. We cannot allow its intent to be
so distorted and stretched and our con-
stitutionally required oversight to be
disregarded. We have an obligation to
conduct oversight continually and push
back on an administration that makes
false claims to advance its warmon-
gering agenda.
The NDAA we passed today gives us
the authority to undertake our defense
of the Nation.
f
S. 1790
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Let me begin by
thanking Ranking Member JACK REED
of Rhode Island and Chairman INHOFE
of Oklahoma, as well as my other col-
leagues on the committee and my staff,
who have worked tirelessly on this to
include key elements of my proposal
that are important to our military, as
well as to our Nation.
This NDAA includes comprehensive
reforms to the Military Housing Pri-
vatization Initiative. It changes mili-
tary housing in ways that are long
overdue and will prioritize families, en-
sure long-term quality assurance, and
enhance accountability.
In the hearings held by the Armed
Services Committee with military fam-
ilies who have experienced adverse
health effects and financial burden
from residing in hazardous housing,
one point was absolutely clear: Our Na-
tion is failing military families who
live in this military housing. The con-
ditions, widespread and prevalent, are
entirely unacceptable. I was heart-
broken to hear much of this testimony
from military families who already
sacrifice so much and who have strug-
gled to secure safe and livable condi-
tions.
I visited some of the homes at the
New London base, and I was struck by
the mold, the repairs that were needed,
the defects in appliances, and the com-
plaints about lack of proper air-condi-
tioning and heating. We owe our mili-
tary families much better, and we owe
law enforcement the support they need
to crack down on fraudulent private
contractors.
I am also proud that the NDAA in-
cludes my provision to prohibit the
Trump administration from modifying
military installations to detain mi-
grant children who have been forcibly
separated from their parents. The sepa-
ration policies of this administration
have been absolutely abhorrent and
antithetical to our values and ideals.
They have been shameful and disgrace-
ful.
We have seen the photos, and those
pictures are worth a thousand of my
words today, but the misuse of mili-
tary resources, as I have repeatedly
emphasized, to implement this admin-
istration’s radical immigration en-
forcement agenda—this provision is a
small but necessary step toward pro-
tecting migrant families from the cru-
elties of this family separation policy.
It is only the beginning. We need to en-
sure that the Department of Homeland
Security reimburses the Defense De-
partment when military resources are
used for support at the border. This
kind of measure will hopefully prevent
DHS from using the Pentagon as a
piggy bank—a financial resource for
cruel and inhumane policies.
We need to ensure that the President
is stopped from abusing his Executive
authority by deploying troops to assist
in deportation.
We also considered floor amendments
to the NDAA. I want to highlight an
amendment that I offered to improve
equity in the post-9/11 GI bill benefit.
Last July, the Pentagon issued a new
policy on servicemembers’ ability to
transfer unused education benefits to
their family members. These new poli-
cies prevent servicemembers with more
than 16 years of military service from
transferring education benefits at the
time that military servicemembers opt
to transfer rather than when they be-
come eligible. The Pentagon argues
that these changes were made to en-
sure that the Department keeps a key
retention tool—all while breaking our
promise to military families by moving
the goalpost of transfer eligibility and
exacerbating inequities in transferring
educational benefits. Most notably, dis-
qualifying servicemembers with more
than 16 years of military services
counterintuitively penalizes the men
and women who have served this coun-
try in uniform for the longest time.
My amendment would make the post-
9/11 GI bill an earned benefit rather
than a retention tool and ensure that
all servicemembers who have com-
pleted 10 years of service in the armed
services and Armed Forces are eligible
to transfer their benefits to dependents
at any time, both while serving on Ac-
tive Duty and as a veteran.
Despite the passage of the NDAA and
the need for this amendment con-
tinuing, I will continue to champion
equitable education benefits for our
military families.
This year’s NDAA makes important,
unprecedented investments in the sub-
marines, helicopters, and aircraft built
in Connecticut. They are not only man-
ufactured in my State—employing
thousands of skilled workers vital to
our defense industrial base—but they
are also critical to our national secu-
rity. They keep our country safe, and
they make sure our Nation and our
military have a fair fight. They play a
vital role in our defense industry
thanks to the unparalleled skills and
unstinting dedication of our manufac-
turing workforce. Because of that
workforce, we are able to build the best
submarines and the best F–35 engines
and other aircraft engines and heli-
copters in the world—not only through
that skilled workforce and those major
contractors but the workers at sup-
pliers and contractors, who are equally
vital.
Last year, we built two submarines.
This year, there will be two more, with
procurement for another major part of
a submarine. As we begin accelerating
production of those Virginia-class sub-
marines, the New London Sub Base
must have the capacity to support in-
creased submarine output. That is why
I fought for $72.3 million to replace
Pier 32 at Sub Base New London, ensur-
ing a modern landing to accommodate
multiple Virginia-class submarines.
I was proud to lead the fight for in-
creased investment in those Virginia-
class submarines. That included $4.7
billion for those two submarines and
nearly $4.3 billion in that advance pro-
curement for a third Virginia-class
submarine.
The NDAA also includes $2.3 billion—
which is $140 million above the Presi-
dent’s request—for the Columbia-class
program.
I was proud, as well, to champion
over $10 billion for 94 F–35s, which are
important to all of our military serv-
ices. That is an additional 16 above the
President’s request.

this Congress. I thank and applaud my
colleagues for coming together on be-
half of our Nation’s defense, which is
especially important in a time of dis-
illusionment and seeming dysfunction
for the American people.
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING WILLIAM MODEN
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I rise
today to honor an officer of the Colo-
rado State Patrol whose watch trag-
ically came to an end earlier this
month when he was killed in the line of
duty.
On June 14, 2019, Trooper William
Moden was responding to an accident
that occurred on I–70 in Deer Trial, CO.
He was doing what he did every day—
responding to an incident and giving a
helping hand to Coloradans in need. He
was assisting the passengers of a vehi-
cle who were involved in a crash—one
of whom was an 18-month-old child—
when he was struck by a passing vehi-
cle.
Like too many of our Nation’s law
enforcement officers, Trooper Moden
gave his life while protecting and serv-
ing others.
William Moden was 37 years old and
had served in the Colorado State Pa-
trol for 12 years. His fellow troopers re-
member him as someone whose uni-
form was always perfect and whose
boots were always polished. There is no
doubt for any of them that he was
meant to serve and that he did so with
the utmost honor and dignity.
While Trooper Moden carried out his
duties with seriousness, his friends and
loved ones remember him as someone
with a tremendous sense of humor. At
a memorial service held last week, he
was described as having an infectious
laugh—a laugh that was usually the
loudest in the room. Many at the serv-
ice remembered the time he put on a
dog’s shock collar just to see how it
felt and to make others laugh. These
are the kinds of memories his loved
ones will remember forever.
Just as he answered when his Colo-
radans called, his friends and family
say he was someone who could always
be counted on. He was reliable, depend-
able, and they often described him as
their ‘‘knight in shining armor’’—
someone who is always there to provide
care and comfort. The chief of the Col-
orado State Patrol, Colonel Matt Pack-
ard, described William Moden as ‘‘the
true personification of what it means
to be a Colorado State Trooper.’’
At the memorial service last week,
Trooper Moden was awarded the title
of ‘‘Master Trooper’’—a rank given
only to those who show great leader-
ship and character. To those who knew
him, William completely exemplified
these characteristics and is certainly
deserving of this high honor.
We know we can never pay the debt
of gratitude owed to people like Wil-
liam Moden, who risk their lives every
day to ensure their communities are
safe. The best we can offer is to never
forget and to continue to celebrate the
lives of those who sacrifice everything.
I know my Senate colleagues will
join me in mourning the loss of Troop-
er Moden and all those who have given
their lives in defending the thin blue
line.
So for the second time this year, I
come to the floor of the U.S. Senate
and remember the words of LTC Dave
Grossman, who said, ‘‘American law
enforcement is the loyal and brave
sheep dog always standing watch for
the wolf that lurks in the dark.’’
I hope the outpouring of love and
support that Trooper Moden’s family
and friends have received in the past
few weeks bring them a small bit of
comfort.
To Trooper Moden’s family and loved
ones, our State thanks you for your
service, sacrifice, and willingness to
share William with the people of Colo-
rado.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.

ator from New Jersey.

BORDER SECURITY
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I
come to the floor once again to speak
about a humanitarian crisis that is not
taking place in Yemen or in Syria or in
any foreign country but, rather, right
here at the southern border of the
United States.
They say a picture speaks a thousand
words, but I think it is even more than
that. Photographs have the power to
cut through noise, speak the truth, and
invoke action.
We all remember the heartbreaking
image of a little boy who was covered
in ash while he sat in an ambulance in
Syria. It told us all we needed to know
about acts of mass murder committed
by Bashar al-Assad. Likewise, we re-
member the look in the eyes of the
malnourished girl who was on the
brink of death in Yemen—one of more
than 85,000 children to have succumbed
to hunger during Saudi Arabia’s disas-
trous bombing campaign. Yet the
photo I have brought to the floor today
has shaken me to the core as a father,
as a grandfather, as a son of immi-
grants, and above all else, as an Amer-
ica.
Like the other photographs I men-
tioned, this one tells a story too. This
one speaks an ugly truth, and that
truth is that President Trump’s cruel,
inhumane, and un-American border
policies have failed. They have failed
to make us safer. They have failed to
reduce migration to our border. They
have also failed to live up to the Amer-
ican values that define our leadership
around the world.
We will never forget this heart-
breaking photo. More importantly, we
will not forget the names of Oscar
Alberto Martinez and his 23-month-old
daughter, Valeria. They drowned in a
desperate attempt to claim asylum in
the United States.
Oscar, Valeria, and Tania, her moth-
er, fled El Salvador in the hopes of
seeking asylum in the United States.
The Washington Post reported:
They traveled more than 1,000 miles seek-
ing it. . . . But the farthest the family got
was an international bridge in Matamoros,
Mexico. On Sunday, they were told the
bridge was closed and that they should re-
turn Monday. Aid workers told The Post the
line to get across the bridge was hundreds
long.
The young family was desperate. Standing
on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande,
America looked within reach. Martinez and
Valeria waded in. But before they all made it
to the other side, the river waters pulled the
25-year-old and his daughter under and swept
them away.
Later, when Mexican authorities re-
covered their bodies, Oscar and Valeria
were still clinging to each other.
Here in the United States, it is hard
to imagine what kind of desperate con-
ditions would propel you to flee your
home and embark on a perilous journey
in search of protection from a foreign
nation.
Most of these families who arrive at
our border come from Guatemala, El
Salvador, and Honduras—three coun-
tries that are collectively known as the
Northern Triangle. It is a region that
is plagued by transnational gang vio-
lence, weak institutions, and poverty.
Young boys are forced into servitude
by gangs. Young girls are beaten and
raped if they refuse to become their
girlfriends. Parents who try to protect
their children end up getting killed.
These countries are among the most
dangerous in the world. In El Salvador,
a woman is murdered every 19 hours,
and in Honduras—the country with the
highest homicide rate in the world for
women—a woman is killed every 16
hours.
To be blunt, these families face an
impossible choice. It is either stay and
die or flee for a chance to live.
Well, if this horrific and tragic pho-
tograph does anything, I hope it dispels
us of the ludicrous notion that you can
deter desperate families from fleeing
their homes in search of safety. That is
how the Trump administration de-
scribes its cruel policies at the border—
deterrence.
In the name of deterrence, it is tear-
ing children and babies away from
their mothers and fathers. In the name
of deterrence, it is shutting down le-
gitimate ports of entry, effectively en-
couraging migrant families to seek
more dangerous methods of getting
into the United States, like crossing
the Rio Grande. In the name of deter-
rence, children are being housed in un-
sanitary conditions, which leaves in-
fants in dirty diapers and children
without soap or toothpaste.
Let me share with our colleagues just
a few of the statements that the chil-
dren who have been kept in these ab-
horrent conditions have made.
Said one 8-year-old boy:
They took us away from our grandmother,
and now we are all alone. They have not

given us to our mother. We have been here
for a long time. I have to take care of my lit-
tle sister. She is very sad because she misses
our mother and grandmother very much. . . .
We sleep on a cement bench. There are two
mats in the room, but the big kids sleep on
the mats, so we have to sleep on the cement
bench.
Consider the words of a 16-year-old
girl:
We slept on mats on the floor, and they
gave us aluminum blankets. They took our
baby’s diapers, baby formula, and all of our
belongings. Our clothes were still wet, and
we were very cold, so we got sick. . . . I have
been in the U.S. for 6 days, and I have never
been offered a shower or been able to brush
my teeth. There is no soap, and our clothes
are dirty. They have never been washed.
Finally, here are the words of a 17-
year-old mother:
I was given a blanket and a mattress, but
then, at 3 a.m., the guards took the blanket
and mattress. My baby was left sleeping on
the floor. In fact, almost every night, the
guards wake us at 3 a.m. and take away our
sleeping mattresses and blankets. . . . They
leave babies, even little babies of 2 or 3
months, sleeping on the cold floor. For me,
because I am so pregnant, sleeping on the
floor is very painful for my back and hips. I
think the guards act this way to punish us.
This is not the America I know. Yet
this administration wants us to forget
who we are. This administration wants
us to believe that if the Government of
the United States is cruel enough, that
if it denies those who seek asylum all
semblances of humanity, that if we ig-
nore basic standards of child welfare,
and that if we abandon fundamental
American values like respect for
human rights, then desperate families
who flee Central America will stop
coming here.
It is not true. The entire doctrine of
deterrence is grounded in hideous lies,
beginning with the lie the President
has fed the people from the moment he
launched his campaign in 2015—the lie
that immigrants are a threat to our se-
curity. President Trump has cast im-
migrants as criminals and rapists and
drug dealers when the truth is that
these migrants are the ones who are
fleeing the criminals, the rapists, and
the drug dealers.
I am sick and tired of these lies, like
when the President repeatedly says he
inherited the policy of family separa-
tion from the Obama administration.
That is a lie. The Trump administra-
tion masterminded this despicable pol-
icy, pure and simple.
These cruel policies are not working.
They have done nothing to stem the
tide of families who seek asylum in the
United States. They have done nothing
to stabilize Central America and to al-
leviate the conditions that force fami-
lies to seek refuge here.
It is time to turn the page. There are
so many alternatives to detention that
are available to the DHS that are far
more humane and far less costly to the
taxpayers.
Consider the Obama administration’s
pilot program known as the family
case management system. It estab-
lished procedures to treat migrant fam-
ilies humanely as their cases moved
forward. Pregnant women, nursing
mothers, or mothers with young chil-
dren were given caseworkers who
helped to educate them on their rights
and their responsibilities. They were
connected to community resources or
to family in the country who could
help them.
According to an inspector general’s
report, the program was an enormous
success. It had a compliance rate of 99
percent. That means that 99 percent of
the time, families in the program
showed up for their ICE check-ins and
appointments. Likewise, they showed
up 100 percent of the time for their im-
migration court hearings. Tell me—
how many government programs work
100 percent of the time? It is very rare.
This one did, but that didn’t stop
President Trump from terminating it.
Even though it had a 99-percent com-
pliance and check-in rate and had 100
percent who showed up for their hear-
ings, oh, no. Evidently, that was not
good enough for the Trump administra-
tion, for it was far more humane and
far less costly to the taxpayers.
Beyond embracing alternatives to
mass detention, we must ramp up hu-
manitarian assistance at the border.
That is why I voted yesterday for the
House’s emergency supplemental bill,
which would provide desperately need-
ed support to on-the-ground organiza-
tions and would better ensure the hu-
mane treatment of children who are in
CBP custody.
The House bill included strong guard-
rails to prevent this White House from
using these funds to pursue its draco-
nian detention practices and mass de-
portation agenda. While the Senate bill
fell short in these areas, I hope the ad-
ministration uses whatever money it
receives to ensure that the children are
properly cared for—in a way that re-
spects basic human rights.
Solving this crisis will take more
than humanitarian funding. If Presi-
dent Trump were serious about reduc-
ing migration, he would be working
day and night to improve the condi-
tions that are driving families to flee
Central America in the first place. In-
stead, he has cut off aid to the North-
ern Triangle and has undermined crit-
ical U.S. efforts to work with Central
American governments to crack down
on gang violence, strengthen the rule
of law, and alleviate poverty.
These programs were working, and
the Trump administration knows it.
Why do I say that? In recent years,
Congress has not only increased fund-
ing for foreign assistance to Central
America, but it has required these gov-
ernments to meet clear benchmarks in
order to demonstrate their progress in
areas like combating drug trafficking
and strengthening their legal systems.
The Trump administration has ac-
knowledged the effectiveness of these
programs on several occasions. In fact,
it has sent Congress not one, not two,
but nine different reports that have
certified these benchmarks have been
met.
Here is just one of them that has
been signed by Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo:
I hereby certify that the central govern-
ment of El Salvador is informing its citizens
of the dangers of the journey to the south-
west border of the United States; combating
human smuggling and trafficking; improving
border security, including preventing illegal
migration, human smuggling and traf-
ficking, and trafficking of illicit drugs and
other contraband; and cooperating with the
United States Government agencies and
other governments in the region to facilitate
the return, repatriation, and reintegration of
illegal migrants arriving at the southwest
border of the United States who do not qual-
ify for asylum consistent with international
law.
This one is dated August 11, 2018.
There are nine certifications by the
Secretary of State saying that the pro-
grams we had going on and working in
Central America were, in fact, work-
ing.
But we all know this President has
no respect for facts or evidence-based
reality. His decision to punish Central
American governments for the migra-
tion crisis by slashing aid is only mak-
ing the crisis worse. It absolutely
makes no sense.
If we want to reduce migration from
Central America, we need a bold strat-
egy to address the root causes driving
families in fear from their home. That
is why my colleagues and I have intro-
duced the Central America Reform and
Enforcement Act. Our bill would dra-
matically expand U.S. engagement in
Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala
through proven programs that help
strengthen the rule of law, combat vio-
lence, and build prosperity. Our bill
would also minimize border crossings
by expanding refugee processing cen-
ters in the region in an effort to reduce
demand at the border, and, finally, it
includes several measures to protect
the welfare of children and ensure effi-
cient, fair, and timely processing of
asylum seekers.
Now, this administration may wish
the Northern Triangle’s serious prob-
lems would just go away, but the
longer we let these conditions fester,
the greater this migration crisis will
become.
There is a very real possibility that
President Trump views a growing crisis
at the border as an asset in his path to
reelection in 2020. The President be-
lieves his best shot at winning elec-
tions is to stoke fear of migrant chil-
dren who pose no threat but des-
perately need the safe embrace of Lady
Liberty.
After all, President Trump cannot
campaign on solving the student loan
debt crisis or providing Americans with
better, cheaper healthcare, or making
sure that big corporations pay their
fair share. He has failed on all these
fronts and more. The only play left in
the Trump playbook is to blame immi-
grants for America’s problems instead
of solving America’s problems.
That is what I call the politics of
hate. The politics of hate is what led

President Trump to attempt to ban
Muslims from traveling to the United
States. The politics of hate is what led
President Trump to end DACA and
threaten 800,000 Dreamers with depor-
tation to countries they have never
called home—young people who
through no choice of their own were
brought to the United States, the only
country they have ever pledged alle-
giance to is the United States and to
the flag of the United States. The only
national anthem they know is the Star
Spangled Banner. The only place they
have ever called home is America.
The politics of hate is what led Presi-
dent Trump to attack TPS holders and
jeopardize thousands of parents to
American-born children. The politics of
hate is what led the administration to
forcibly separate nearly 2,800 children
from their parents—and maybe thou-
sands more, because they don’t even
have a recordkeeping system of where
all of these children are. That is a pol-
icy that will forever be a stain on our
history.
The politics of hate is what led Presi-
dent Trump to tweet out his plan to
send ICE agents into our communities
to terrorize our towns and cities with
mass arrests and mass deportations. It
is a plan that would leave millions of
U.S.-born American citizen children
wondering: Why mom never came to
pick me up at school or why dad never
made it home for dinner. It is a plan
that would inflict traumatic and irrep-
arable harm on American children who
would not only have to reckon with the
loss of a parent but the loss of the in-
come provided by that parent. The pol-
itics of hate led to the remain-in-Mex-
ico policy, which forces asylum seekers
to remain in Mexico amid dangerous
conditions.
Indeed, just yesterday, U.S. asylum
officers requested that the courts block
the Trump administration from requir-
ing migrants to stay in Mexico, stating
it is ‘‘fundamentally contrary to the
moral fabric of our Nation and our
international domestic legal obliga-
tions.’’
Now, in the latest action, I fear it is
the politics of hate that explain the
awful press reports we heard today sug-
gesting that President Trump plans to
end a program that protects undocu-
mented members of U.S. military fami-
lies from deportation. Imagine that—
someone who wears the uniform of the
United States, who may serve halfway
around the world in service to the Na-
tion, who risks their lives, and now you
are going to take the one program that
put their mind at ease—that their
spouse or child, who may be undocu-
mented in the country and had the
ability to stay because of that service-
member’s service, and now you are
going to say you are going to deport
their children, their spouse.
Well, if someone is willing to wear
the uniform of the United States,
pledge allegiance to our flag, and risk
their life to defend this Nation in bat-
tle, the last thing we ought to do is to
deport their loved ones.
The Trump administration’s policies
at our border have brought us nothing
but chaos, despair, and shame. We can-
not let the politics of fear and hate de-
grade the values that make America
great.
We cannot wall off our country from
the strife gripping Central America.
We cannot tweet our way out of this
problem. We must lead our way out of
this problem with real solutions and
strategies that bring sanity, dignity,
and order back to our border and pre-
vent the kind of tragic loss of human
life we saw earlier this week on the
banks of the Rio Grande. We are just
better than this. We are just better
than this.
If my colleagues do not raise their
voices, then, they are complicit to this.
History will judge us poorly.
I hope we will have bipartisan voices
who say: This is not who we are; this is
not what we stand for. And we can
work toward making sure this tragic
photograph never ever happens again.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio.
f
IMMIGRATION
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I was
coming to floor today to talk about
legislation we just got passed in the
last week in the Homeland Security
Committee with the hopes that I can
convince some of my colleagues to join
us in this effort, and I will talk about
that bill in a moment. But first let me,
if I could, address the photograph and
the comments from my colleague from
New Jersey.
He showed a tragic photograph that
so many of my constituents and all
Americans have seen—Oscar Alberto
Martinez Ramirez and his daughter
Valeria, facedown in the Rio Grande.
This man came from El Salvador. We
don’t know all the details yet, but
clearly he was interested in coming to
the United States and applying for asy-
lum, as so many others have come—
hundreds a day, thousands a week, hun-
dreds of thousands a month now, over-
whelming the infrastructure at the
border, pulling 40 to 60 percent of our
Border Patrol off the border to deal
with the humanitarian crisis that has
occurred.
That tragic photograph—and it is a
horrific photo of a daughter clinging to
her father’s neck, having drowned in
the Rio Grande coming over from Mex-
ico—should be a wake-up call. I agree
with that, but it should not be a wake-
up call to have us continue to point
fingers around here at the other side
and blame someone else for the prob-
lem. It should instead be a wake-up
call for solutions—for bipartisan solu-
tions—because that is all that works to
be able to resolve these issues.
I hope the first step will be taken
today, because I just learned, as I came
to the floor, that the House of Rep-
resentatives is now considering taking
up the legislation we passed here in the
Senate just yesterday. It provides im-
mediate emergency funds for humani-
tarian assistance at the border that is
needed right now. We passed it with
over 80 votes here in the Senate—82
votes, with 9 of our Members absent, I
believe. Over 82 votes is very unusual
for anything to pass around here, par-
ticularly something so substantial.
It is bipartisan. It came out of the
Appropriations Committee with a 30-
to-1 vote to get these funds and these
resources down to the border now to
help with this true humanitarian crisis
that we are facing. Everyone must ac-
knowledge that.
The House was balking at that. They
were sending us another bill that had
some partisan elements to it that no
Republican could support in the
House—not a single one.
Finally, I think they have decided to
pick up our bipartisan bill and pass it,
and thank God, because now the Presi-
dent can sign it and that aid can go
down to our border immediately where
it is needed.
But I have to be frank with you. That
humanitarian aid going down to the
border is not enough because I don’t
think it would have had an impact on
the tragic photograph that was talked
about on the floor earlier.
That incident did not occur because
of the lack of humanitarian aid that is
badly needed. That incident occurred
because there is this pull factor to
come to our country, particularly from
these Northern Triangle countries—
Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador.
This particular gentleman, Oscar
Alberto Martinez Ramirez, came from
El Salvador.
Then, there are push factors from
those countries. And, again, this is
causing so many families to come here,
so many unaccompanied children to
come here from these three countries
in Central America.
The traffickers are telling them: If
you come to America and you ask for
asylum, you will be let in.
Let’s be frank. These countries are
countries that have real challenges and
real problems.
My colleague from New Jersey is
right. We have sent a lot of American
taxpayer dollars down to those coun-
tries, and he noted that the reports
back from the administration and oth-
ers are positive, saying it is beginning
to make a difference. He noted that
that funding is now being reduced or
even eliminated in some cases, but it
was during the time when that funding
was there that the people started com-
ing.
So, yes, we should have more funding
that is effective for those countries. I
agree with that. The Millennium Chal-
lenge Corporation funding is the new
way we send that funding. It is more
effective because it says: What are you
doing in Central America to improve
your infrastructure, your conditions,
your judicial system, your rule of law,
and to fight corruption? We need to do
all those things.

June 27, 2019
But let’s be frank. Let’s be honest.
We have been doing that, and yet the
push factor is still there.
So I believe it is part of the answer,
but I don’t think logic applied to this
situation means that you could say
that it is all of the answer because we
have been doing it.
My taxpayers and other taxpayers, I
think, around this country are willing
to do more, but they also want to deal
with the pull factor, and the pull factor
is very simple. If you come to America
and you apply for asylum right now,
with the system being overwhelmed
and with certain laws in place, includ-
ing a court decision, you are released
into the community, meaning you
come into America. Most of the court
cases that deal with whether you are
successful or not in your asylum claim
take over 2 years now. It takes over 2
years until you are before a judge for a
hearing.
When those court cases occur, we are
told on the Homeland Security Com-
mittee, that about 15 percent of those
individuals are granted asylum—15 per-
cent.
Now, in America, our wages are 10 to
20 times higher than they are in these
Northern Triangle countries—El Sal-
vador, Guatemala, Honduras. Is it any
wonder that they come here seeking a
better way of life? No, you would too.
But we have to have a system of laws
here in this country where, yes, we ac-
cept refugees and, yes, we accept peo-
ple who have claims of asylum that are
granted, but we don’t have open bor-
ders.
We have a system here, a system of
laws, and it has clearly broken down
now. Again, thousands come in every
week, hundreds of thousands every
month—mostly families, mostly chil-
dren because of the way our laws work.
I don’t think we should be separating
families, by the way. So, if you have a
child with you or you are a child, then
under a court decision you could be
held only for a short period of time, 20
days maximum, in emergency situa-
tions. What happens is that people are
released into the community.
I will be frank with you. From what
we have heard from Customs and Bor-
der Protection and from the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services,
which are responsible for many of these
detention facilities, they are so over-
whelmed, they don’t even have room
for 20 days, so people are allowed to
come into the community. Again, the
court cases happen a long time after
that, and people are granted work per-
mits. That is why people are coming. It
is a pull. They are saying: If you get to
America, we will get you in.
These traffickers are charging a lot
of money. It is horrible. They are tak-
ing mortgages on people’s homes. They
are saying ‘‘We will take half your pay
for the next year,’’ promising things
that are frankly beyond what can be
accomplished.
A situation in Ohio occurred a couple
years ago with kids from Guatemala.
Unaccompanied kids coming from Gua-
temala were told: You can get in. It is
good. We will take care of you. In this
case, the traffickers took mortgages on
the parents’ homes. They brought
these kids to the United States, to the
Department of Health and Human
Services, HHS, detention facility. They
were then sent out to sponsor families,
which is what they do. They take these
minor children, underaged, and send
them to sponsor families. Sometimes
they can find families; sometimes they
can’t. In this case, our own government
sent these kids back to the traffickers
because the traffickers applied for the
very kids they had brought up from
Guatemala.
Despite claims and promises to their
parents that they would get a good
education with a family taking care of
these kids, do you know what they did
with these kids? They put them on an
egg farm in Ohio—underage kids—and
exploited them. They took away their
pay, had them live in conditions none
of us would find acceptable for any
member of our family. They had them
living in trailers, some of them under
trailers, on mattresses without sheets,
working 12 hours a day. Some of these
kids were working 6 days a week, some
7 days a week. This is not America. Yet
this was happening. Again, our system
is broken. These traffickers were ex-
ploiting these children.
Finally, in this case, law enforce-
ment stepped in, and we have been able
to indict and convict the traffickers.
Thank goodness. But this is not a situ-
ation that can or should continue.
In the tragic photo of the story I just
told, the answer is not politically
pointing fingers. Blaming Donald
Trump isn’t going to solve this prob-
lem. We need as a body to change the
laws. We need as a body to provide
more effective aid to those countries.
That is true. The push factors and the
pull factors both need to be addressed.
But if we just play politics with this on
both sides, we will have more unneces-
sary deaths. We will have more tragic
situations.
Again, I had planned to come and
talk about something else, and I will,
briefly. But I must say, with regard to
this immigration challenge we face as
a country, I hope the tragedy we have
now all seen online and on TV serves as
a wake-up call to get to bipartisan so-
lutions that actually help solve this
problem and stop the push factors and
the pull factors that will continue to
bring hundreds of thousands of people
from these three countries to our bor-
der, which has overwhelmed us.
Today there is a start. Today there is
a start with the humanitarian aid
package. Thank goodness.
Tomorrow we need to get to work to
talk about these bigger problems. I will
say, I have worked on this with some of
my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle. I heard the words today from my
colleague from New Jersey about ref-
ugee processing centers. I think that is
part of the answer. In the Obama ad-
ministration, you could apply for ref-
ugee status from your country—El Sal-
vador, Guatemala, Honduras—and not
come to the border. The refugee cri-
teria is almost identical to the criteria
for asylum. The United Nations does
this all over the world. I agree, that is
a much better solution.
Let’s have these processing centers
in the Northern Triangle countries.
Let’s have one in Mexico, maybe one in
Mexico at the southern border with
Guatemala, maybe one at the northern
border of the United States. Let’s deal
with this processing problem. Let’s de-
termine who is qualified, who has a le-
gitimate fear of persecution. Again, 15
percent of them are now being granted.
The other 85 percent are not. For the
others, we have to say: You can apply
to come to the United States as every-
body else does, from Mexico, from the
Philippines, from India, from countries
in Africa, and we need to continue to
be a generous country with regard to
immigration. But we have to have a
system of laws, and we have to stop
these tragedies where people are being
told by traffickers: You can make this
journey to the north. It will be fine.
It is not fine. It is arduous, it is dan-
gerous, and you see the results.
The trafficking that is going on of
girls and women is all part of this too.
It is not going to stop unless we as a
group here in Congress, on a bipartisan
basis, deal not just with the push fac-
tors but also the pull factors and deal
with them realistically.
f
NONPROFIT SECURITY GRANT
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, the
legislation I came to the floor to talk
about today passed in the Homeland
Security Committee last week to help
make our synagogues, our churches,
our mosques, and other nonprofit insti-
tutions safer.
Sadly, we have seen a troubling pat-
tern in recent years. Hate-fueled at-
tacks at houses of worship and reli-
gious institutions, not just in our coun-
try but around the world, are becoming
more and more common. A couple of
months ago, a shooting at a synagogue
outside San Diego took the life of Lori
Gilbert Kaye, who heroically sacrificed
herself to save her rabbi. Exactly 6
months to the day prior to that, the
shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue
outside of Pittsburgh, PA, claimed 11
lives, the worst act of anti-Semitic vio-
lence in U.S. history.
Sometimes this hate is manifested in
other ways: bomb threats at the Jewish
Community Center in Columbus, OH,
and anti-Semitic graffiti sprayed on
the Hebrew Union College walls in my
hometown of Cincinnati, OH.
Right after the attacks on the syna-
gogue in Pittsburgh last year, I went to
the Jewish Community Center in
Youngstown, OH, only 60 miles away
from Pittsburgh, to meet with Jewish
community leaders. An attack on one
is an attack on all. We must all stand
up.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4614 June 27, 2019
In Youngstown that somber day, we
talked about where we go from here to
stop anti-Semitism and hatred. I asked
them for input about what the Federal
Government can do to help keep the
Jewish community safe. Part of the
input I got was that we need more help
on best practices on security and more
resources to protect our community
centers, our schools, our churches, our
synagogues, our mosques.
The resurgence of this anti-Semitism
must be confronted and defeated with
all the energy we can bring to bear.
But sadly, it is not just related to the
Jewish community, which has known
it for over the centuries. Hate seldom
stops at one religion or one country.
Hundreds of Christians in Sri Lanka
were massacred in churches and hotels
on Easter Sunday. In New Zealand, the
shooting at the mosques in Christ-
church killed at least 49 people. We
will never forget the 2015 tragic
killings of African-American parish-
ioners at Emmanuel AME Church in
Charleston, SC, where I have visited
and prayed, or the 2017 attacks on the
First Baptist Church in Sutherland
Springs, TX.
While I have highlighted unconscion-
able mass murders, there are so many
other examples of vandalism and har-
assment. We saw this in my home
State of Ohio this February, where a
man holding a gun smashed the win-
dows of a mosque in Dayton while wor-
shipers were praying inside. We saw it
in Louisiana this April when three his-
torically Black churches were delib-
erately burned down within the same
parish. This violence is senseless and
contrary to our values as Americans.
Our first obligation as Americans and
certainly as public officials is to stand
up and say this must stop. Stop the
hate—not just partisan finger-pointing
but a single, unified message. Targeted
communities cannot stop it on their
own. We must remind all of our fellow
citizens that we are all made in the
image of God, and the anti-Semitism,
the hatred, and the violence are not ac-
ceptable in this country.
Sadly, if these trends are any indica-
tion, we also have to recognize these
attacks are likely to continue, and I
think Congress can and should do more
to provide synagogues, mosques,
churches, and other faith-based organi-
zations with best practices and more
resources to secure their facilities ef-
fectively.
Based in part on the input I received
in Youngstown that sad day, I have
been the leading supporter of the Non-
profit Security Grant Program. This
grant program allows nonprofits, in-
cluding synagogues and other faith-
based organizations, to apply for funds
they can use to access best practices to
secure their facilities and to train per-
sonnel.
Some good news came out recently.
Under the new Department of Home-
land Security rules, nonprofits are now
permitted to hire armed security per-
sonnel with these funds. That is some-
thing I had promoted. I think it is a
good idea because it is needed. Last
year, I led a bipartisan letter with Sen-
ator CASEY to push for a total of $60
million for the program nationwide. I
am happy to say that funding level was
incorporated in the final Homeland Se-
curity appropriations bill.
This year, I am working with my col-
leagues to actually authorize this pro-
gram to be sure it will be there in the
future and to increase the amount of
funding in the program to $75 million
so that nonprofits outside of the larg-
est urban areas—which are currently
being served through the initial pro-
gram—also have access to this funding.
Unfortunately, in a lot of instances I
talked about earlier, it was not in
major urban centers. So it is being
spread well beyond our big cities.
To support that effort, my colleague
Senator GARY PETERS and I have intro-
duced bipartisan legislation called the
Protecting Faith-Based and Nonprofit
Organizations from Terrorism Act to
provide best practices and more fund-
ing for hardening vulnerable nonprofits
and faith-based institutions and for
training resources for those congrega-
tions.
The bill authorizes $75 million annu-
ally for the next 5 years, $50 million to
be used by nonprofits located within
high-risk, large urban areas, and the
rest will be available for nonprofits in
other areas.
I am pleased to report that the
Homeland Security Committee unani-
mously approved this bill last week. I
look forward to its coming to the floor,
where I hope it can be passed on a bi-
partisan basis. While our bill is pend-
ing, I hope my colleagues in the Appro-
priations Committee will once again be
receptive to the letter and spirit of our
bill to make those resources available
to urban and nonurban areas alike.
I will continue to work with my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to en-
sure that the thousands of religious
and other nonprofit institutions in
Ohio and across our country are safe
and welcoming places. I pray we will
see the day when such security grants
are not necessary because we will abide
by the admonition to love our neigh-
bors as ourselves. But in the meantime,
let’s do what we can to give our com-
munities the know-how, the resources,
and the best practices so they can be
safer and more secure.
I yield the floor.

ator from Wyoming.
f
FISCAL CHALLENGES
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the
Senator from Ohio for his outstanding
comments on faith-biased security and
the immigration crisis that we are fac-
ing and the solutions he suggested. We
have a lot of work to do there.
Now you get to hear from the ac-
countant.
I come to the floor today to call at-
tention to the Federal Government’s
unsustainable fiscal outlook.
Yesterday in the Senate Budget Com-
mittee we had a hearing on fixing our
broken budget and spending process,
with a focus on securing our country’s
fiscal future. Our witness was the
Comptroller General of the United
States, the head of the Government Ac-
countability Office.
In April of this year, GAO issued its
third annual update on the nation’s fis-
cal health. The report concluded that
the Federal Government is on an
unsustainable fiscal path.
A Congressional Budget Office report
released this week on the long-term
budget outlook painted a similarly
bleak picture, noting that our surging
Federal debt is putting our Nation at
risk of a ‘‘fiscal crisis.’’ This is one of
the charts we got to see. I know it is
pretty hard for people to read. We are
figuring out a way to make this bigger.
The impact will be tremendous. It
shows that, in 2019, Social Security
spending passed the $1 trillion mark
annually. In 2021, the highway trust
fund will be unable to meet all obliga-
tions. In 2022, the discretionary spend-
ing caps will expire, allowing unlimited
spending. In 2025, the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation multiemployer
fund will be depleted. It will be insuffi-
cient to pay full benefits to insolvent
pension plans. In 2025, CBO projects the
net interest spending will surpass the
spending on national defense. In 2026,
the Medicare hospital insurance trust
fund will be depleted. With some in-
coming revenue, it will be sufficient to
pay 91 percent of hospital-related Medi-
care spending, which is already forced
to be low.
In 2030, the net interest spending will
exceed $1 trillion annually. The inter-
est will exceed $1 trillion annually.
In 2031, mandatory spending and in-
terest will consume all Federal rev-
enue. It means we will not get to make
any decisions on anything that isn’t
mandatory, which we don’t get to
make decisions on right now.
In 2032, the Social Security trust
fund will be depleted. The amount of
money coming in that will be paid out
right away will only pay 77 percent of
the scheduled benefits. I will cover that
more later.
Those are a few of the fiscal cliffs we
are facing that could be solved now,
that have to be solved now. If they are
solved now, they have simpler, less
impactful problems than if we wait
until the cliff gets here.
The Federal Government is swim-
ming in a sea of red ink that threatens
to drown America’s future generations.
If current laws don’t change, debt as a
percentage of GDP, will soar to unprec-
edented levels over the next 30 years.
Let me repeat that. If current laws
don’t change, debt as a percentage of
GDP—that is production—will soar to
unprecedented levels over the next 30
years. By 2037, our debt-to-GDP ratio—
that is debt-to-production—will sur-
pass the historical records set in the
aftermath of World War II. By 2049,
debt will stand at 144 percent of GDP.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4615
June 27, 2019
That is how bond investors determine
the likelihood of getting their money
back. Interest rates reflect that fact
and go up as risk increases. As that
percentage goes up, the risk increases.
The amount we have to pay to borrow
any money will go up, if people still
loan us money, which gets us to what
is on the chart.
In 2030, net interest will exceed $1
trillion a year annually. That is not
buying anything; that is paying the in-
terest.
In most of the Nation’s history, we
have only seen periods of high spending
and debt during wars and other emer-
gencies, and the increase has been tem-
porary, but today’s fiscal situation is
different.
We are facing a demographic fiscal
storm. For decades, nonpartisan ex-
perts, including the Congressional
Budget Office and the Government Ac-
countability Office, have warned of the
budget pressures that we would face as
baby boomers aged and began to retire.
We heard yesterday from the GAO
that, on average, more than 10,000 peo-
ple per day turn 65 years of age, and in
the next few years, that number will
rise to more than 11,000. Here is a little
chart of how those thousands per day
grow.
Some of us were under the impres-
sion, of course, that the baby boomers
eventually would die. That is kind of
an inevitable sort of thing. What we
didn’t count on was the extra longevity
that everybody will have and the fact
that there are other generations com-
ing up. So the chart does not tail off
here on the end. The chart continues to
grow, even though the birth rate is
down.
The combination of aging population,
longer lifespans, and rising per-bene-
ficiary healthcare costs put enormous
pressure on our spending.
According to the CBO, the projected
explosion in debt we will see over the
next few decades and beyond occurs be-
cause of mandatory spending—particu-
larly Social Security and major
healthcare programs, specifically,
Medicare and Medicaid—not to men-
tion the interest payments on the na-
tional debt that will permanently grow
faster than Federal revenues.
This autospent money—spending
that is never looked at—has already
grown from about 36 percent of the
Federal budget 50 years ago to 70 per-
cent today. If left unchecked, CBO
projects that more than 80 cents of
every dollar the government spends
will be on mandatory spending, guaran-
teed to be spent without further ap-
proval, not to mention the interest by
2049.
Because mandatory spending oper-
ates on autopilot, not subject to the
annual appropriations process, it often
escapes congressional scrutiny and
proper oversight. It would be one thing
if mandatory spending programs by-
passed the appropriations process be-
cause they were fully funded through
their own dedicated source of revenue,
but that is not the case.
As this chart shows, many of the
largest mandatory programs, such as
Medicaid and food stamps, don’t have
their own source of funding and instead
rely entirely on money from the Treas-
ury’s general fund. You can see the
blue here. That is money that will be
coming in. The red is the extra money
that has to be spent to meet the obliga-
tions. On some of these, you will note
that there is no blue at all. That means
this is coming out of the general fund,
which is where we expect to be able to
get defense, education, and all of the
other things we do. So there is enough
spent right here on excess that doesn’t
have a source of revenue that forces ev-
erything else we do to be borrowed, and
I already mentioned the problems of
borrowing.
Even though some of these programs
do collect some revenue—and a few of
them do collect their own revenue—
they often spend more than they take
in. It didn’t used to be the case. We
used to have a lot more people working
and paying into Social Security than
were receiving Social Security, and
there used to be a huge surplus, which
we spent and then put as bonds in the
drawer. We are now drawing down on
those bonds, even though there is no
real money to back them up, but that
is about to be depleted as well.
Over the next 10 years, CBO projects
that Social Security spending will
total $14.4 trillion, but the program’s
dedicated tax revenues will only cover
$11.8 trillion of that. That is $14.4 tril-
lion going out and $11.8 trillion coming
in. You can’t do that very long.
CBO projects that under current law,
Social Security’s combined trust funds
would be exhausted through 2032. You
may say: That is a long time into the
future, 2032. Well, that is 3 years ear-
lier than the Social Security trustees
estimated just earlier this year. How
many times can we have that acceler-
ated by 3 years before we are at the
cliff?
Total Medicare spending will amount
to $11.5 trillion over the next 10 years,
but the program just collects $6 trillion
in dedicated taxes and premiums—
again, $11.5 trillion going out and $6
trillion coming in.
CBO and the Medicare trustees both
projected Medicare’s Hospital Insur-
ance Trust Fund, which covers inpa-
tient hospital services, hospice care,
skilled nursing facilities, and home
health services, will be depleted in 2026.
Spending on military and civilian re-
tirement programs will total nearly $2
trillion, but Federal employees’ con-
tributions toward their pension will
only be $70 billion. I don’t like that
word ‘‘trillion.’’ It is kind of hard to
wrap your head around it. Billions are
tough enough, but $2 trillion is $2,000
billion. That is what is going out, $2,000
billion. What is coming in is $70 billion.
There is a little bit of a gap. Just as
with most other spending programs,
this difference will be made up with
general fund revenues, which today are
all borrowed funds.
Social Security and much of Medi-
care is supposed to be different though.
Under current law, once their respec-
tive trust funds are exhausted, those
programs will still pay out money, but
they will only be able to pay out as
much in benefits as they have coming
in. We heard yesterday from the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office that,
for Medicare, that means only being
able to pay 91 cents on the dollar for
hospital-related Medicare spending.
How long do you think doctors will put
up with that? How many hospitals will
that put out of business? For Social Se-
curity, revenue is projected to be suffi-
cient to cover only 77 percent of sched-
uled benefits. Who on Social Security
will be able to afford a cut of 23 per-
cent? That is the fiscal cliff.
Of course, this shouldn’t be news to
lawmakers. For years, the warnings
that these programs are on an
unsustainable fiscal course have gone
largely unheeded, hoping that the next
Congress, the next President, or maybe
the next generation would be more
willing to deal with the problem.
To be clear, I want to make sure So-
cial Security and Medicare are able to
continue providing benefits to current
beneficiaries, as well as those who may
need these programs in the future.
That will require us to work together
in a bipartisan manner to ensure these
programs’ solvency. If we don’t make
changes to the way these programs
currently operate, a lot of people in the
future will just be out of luck. There
are levers that can be pulled on these.
If any one is pulled, it would be a trag-
edy to whomever it affects. If they are
all pulled, it is less noticeable but still
noticeable based on how long it is be-
fore we ever reach a solution on these
problems.
Ignoring the problem will not make
it go away and, in this case, the oppo-
site is true. The longer we wait to ad-
dress this imbalance, the more severe
the changes will need to be, and we will
have fewer options.
We need to change the way we do
things around here. Too often we wait
to make the difficult decisions that ev-
eryone knows has to be made until we
have a crisis on our hands. In the Budg-
et Committee, we are focused on trying
to put together bipartisan budget proc-
ess reform proposals that will help us
confront these thorny fiscal issues in a
more reasoned, timely, and responsible
way.
I am hopeful we will get there. I am
encouraged with the conversations we
have had that we will get there. These
issues are too important to ignore, and
we are going to need to work together
if we are to put our country on a more
sustainable fiscal course. We owe it to
future generations to try.
We have handled some crises around
here. Recently, we handled one of na-
tional disasters. The national disasters
don’t have to be paid for. They aren’t a
part of the budget caps—they should be
a part of the budget caps, but they
don’t have to be a part of the budget

caps—so they just get exempt as long
as they are voted on, but everybody
wants to help everybody with a prob-
lem, so we go ahead and pass those
straight to debt. One week, at the be-
ginning of the week, when we proposed
it, it was $13 billion. When it actually
passed it, it was up to $19.1 billion.
That all went to additional debt.
It is a crisis. We need to plan for it.
We need to prioritize for it. We need to
fit that in, but we can’t do everything,
continue to escalate everything, and
consider that things we haven’t look at
for years are OK to keep doing the
same way we are doing them or to have
the duplication. We are doing hearings
all the time on ways this problem can
be solved, but it is important that we
start solving it soon or future genera-
tions will be drastically affected.
In fact, the dates I had up here ear-
lier, present generations will be af-
fected. We need to get everyone on
board looking for solutions and biting
the bullet now to do them.
I have had a penny plan for a long
time. Under the penny plan, if we just
stopped spending 1 cent out of every
dollar we spend, not counting Social
Security, no change in Social Secu-
rity—if we just found ways to do things
1 percent better, and we did that for 7
consecutive years, our budget would
balance. If we started with a penny, I
am pretty sure we would say: That
really didn’t hurt too bad. How about if
we do 2 cents? Now we cut it back to 4
years, and we can start paying down
debt, which we have to do for our fu-
ture generations, if our kids and
grandkids are going to have the kind of
life we had.
I am working for and hoping for ev-
erybody working together to solve
these problems. If we just talk about
them, and we don’t work on them, it is
pretty depressing but not as depressing
as it will be hurting.
I ask my colleagues to take a look at
this and help come up with solutions. I
am impressed with those who are work-
ing with me on it.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
ENZI). Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I sit here
every Thursday from 3 o’clock to 6
o’clock and hear several speeches that
are made. I happen to sit on the Budget
Committee with Chairman ENZI. I hope
everyone listened carefully to what he
just said. The Comptroller General was
in yesterday.
One of the reasons I ran for Senate is
that being a Main Street entrepreneur
from Indiana, you never could have
gotten by with the way this place runs
its business. The Federal Government
is somewhere around six to seven times
the size of Walmart and runs its busi-
ness by the seat of its pants, in the
sense that we have not done a budget
that we have appropriated in nearly 20
years.
If you listened closely, you know we
have some hard deadlines. The chair-
man referred to it as cliffs. Well, some-
times that is so figurative that you
don’t believe it is going to happen or
that it is going to be real. These are
things we are going to have to contend
with.
When the Medicare fund is depleted
fully in 2026, benefits get cut imme-
diately. Social Security is farther down
the trail, and there are going to be all
kinds of issues. We are lucky, cur-
rently, that other countries and our
own citizens will lend us money when
we run trillion-dollar deficits rou-
tinely.
He mentioned the ‘‘Penny Plan.’’ In
any business, if you were charged with
fixing your company’s problems by cut-
ting back by either freezing expenses
by a 1-percent cut or a 2-percent cut,
that would be done easily because you
have hard accountability. If you would
perform in a business or a State gov-
ernment like we do here, I can guar-
antee you there wouldn’t be a lender
that would let you perpetuate and keep
doing it. The fact that we have a credit
card that we can put it on year after
year eliminates the accountability
that you have anywhere else.
I was on a school board for 10 years.
I was in State government in Indiana,
where we always have a cash balance
and operate in the black and have a
balanced budget. Even though we do
that so routinely there, we passed a
balanced budget amendment to our
State constitution simply because gov-
ernment, even in a place like Indiana,
oftentimes views how they spend the
people’s money different, and this
place does it worse than any other
place in the country.
So do we want to get to the point
where we deplete the Medicare trust
fund and where we run out of funds to
pay pensioners or do we want to make
the hard decisions?
It is funny. When I got here, I looked
at the budget process. Budgets, even
though they are not adhered to, might
be a resolution, and it is not the law.
Always, even if they do incorporate
savings, you never see it until year 6, 7,
8, 9, and 10. Well, again, in the real
world, if you are running at a 20-per-
cent loss on your P&L, you do not have
the luxury to wait 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 years
to fix it.
I ask the American public to hold
their Senators accountable and their
congressmen, because this time, unlike
in 2008, which we all know was bad
enough, the main people holding the
bag will be retirees and the elderly who
depend on the government for
healthcare, and individuals who depend
on healthcare who are not well to do,
through Medicaid, will be left holding
the bag.
Only 22 Republicans—it should have
been all 53 of us who were on the Penny
Plan bill that Senator PAUL put out
just a few weeks ago, but only 22 of our
own conference, which talks about fis-
cal conservatism—got on that bill. I
would hope that the American public
holds their representatives accountable
so that we don’t hit the cliff and go
over it and pay the consequences,
which will be dear.

TRIBUTE TO GARY WOODLAND
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, while my
remarks in front of me say ‘‘I rise
today,’’ I sit today on this Senate floor
to congratulate a Topeka, KS, native, a
2019 U.S. Open champion, Gary Wood-
land.
Gary Woodland grew up in Topeka
and attended Shawnee Heights High
School. After high school, Gary at-
tended Washburn University on a full
basketball scholarship before transfer-
ring to the University of Kansas to join
the golf team. This U.S. Open was the
first major championship victory of
Gary Woodland’s career, and Gary
made history by becoming the first
graduate of the University of Kansas to
ever win a PGA major tournament.
Gary’s performance at Pebble Beach
was truly elite. He scored under par in
all four rounds, including an impres-
sive 6-under-par 65 in the second round.
On Sunday’s final round, Gary battled
the elements and a late surge by last
year’s U.S. Open champion, Brooks
Koepka. On hole 18, Gary sunk a long
birdie putt to solidify his win at 13
strokes under par, 1 stroke better than
Tiger Woods’ historic 2000 U.S. Open
victory at Pebble Beach.
I congratulate Gary on this historic
win, but I also recognize his actions off
the course. Gary is an advocate for
Special Olympics and also partners
with Folds of Honor, a nonprofit orga-
nization that grants scholarships to
family members of U.S. servicemem-
bers. Gary even wore patriotic golf
gear to honor our troops and Folds of
Honor at the U.S. Open. After the win,
Gary thanked our troops for their serv-
ice and stated: ‘‘There’s men and
women who sacrifice and do so much
for us so I can go out and play a game
of golf and live my life under freedom.’’
The final round also coincides with
Father’s Day, and this undoubtedly
made this championship even more sig-
nificant as Gary’s father watched him
sink the final putt on 18. Gary said,
after his win, that his dad worked
nights so he could pursue his love of
sports and spend time with him during
the day.
I recognize Gary, but I also want to
recognize the entire Woodland family—

f
PUBLIC SERVICE FREEDOM TO
NEGOTIATE ACT
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, conserv-
ative, rightwing forces in our country
are engaged in an all-out assault on
working people. Their target? Private
and public sector workers and the
unions who are fighting on their be-
half. While private sector unions at
least have some protections under the
National Labor Relations Act, public
employees have been historically
forced to rely on Supreme Court prece-
dent to protect their basic rights.
That is why the Court’s decision last
year in Janus was so damaging. In one
fell swoop, the Court overturned more
than 40 years of precedent from the
Abood decision and barred public sec-
tor unions from collecting fair share
fees from employees who had opted out
of the union but whom the union is
still legally required to represent.
The Supreme Court’s decision in
Janus was not unexpected. Its decision
was the culmination of decades-long ef-
forts by groups like the Federalist So-
ciety and the Heritage Foundation to
undermine settled precedent in Abood
in order to weaken public sector
unions. These groups worked methodi-
cally to achieve their goals.
First, Justice Alito all but invited a
challenge to Abood when he wrote his
decision in Knox v. SEIU Local 100 and
Harris v. Quinn. He called the justifica-
tion for allowing a union to collect fair
share fees ‘‘an anomaly.’’ He said ‘‘the
Abood Court’s analysis is questionable
on several grounds’’ and laid out the
grounds as he saw them for someone to
bring a case to overturn Abood.
This was an open invitation to con-
servative groups to then go looking for
a plaintiff to do just that—to create an
opportunity for the Supreme Court to
overturn Abood. They funded
Friedrichs v. California Teachers Asso-
ciation, which was fast-tracked to the
Supreme Court in 2016, where ‘‘the sig-
naler,’’ Justice Alito, awaited the case.
Public employee unions received a
temporary reprieve in a deadlocked 4-
to-4 decision because of Justice
Antonin Scalia’s unexpected death.
The well-funded conservative inter-
ests then saw a huge opportunity to fill
the vacancy with a Justice to their lik-
ing. From applauding Senator MCCON-
NELL’s single-handedly blocking the
nomination of Merrick Garland to
spending millions to confirm Neil
Gorsuch, they wanted a Justice who
was on their side.
They got it in Neil Gorsuch, who de-
livered the decisive fifth vote in Janus,
torpedoing 41 years of precedent under
the pretext of protecting ‘‘fundamental
free speech rights.’’ Justice Elena
Kagan saw right through this argu-
ment. In a strong dissent, she said:
‘‘The majority overthrows a decision
entrenched in this Nation’s law . . . for
over 40 years . . . and it does so by
weaponizing the First Amendment, in a
way that unleashes judges, now and in
the future, to intervene in economic
and regulatory policy.’’
Undermining public employee unions
and, in fact, all unions has gained mo-
mentum because of the conservative
majority on the Supreme Court. With
this narrow majority, we are likely to
see a lot more 5-to-4 decisions on ideo-
logical, partisan lines. This is not good
for the country and not good for the
credibility of the Court. We need a Su-
preme Court that strives to achieve
consensus as often as possible, not one
pursuing a hard-right ideological agen-
da.
In the face of these onslaughts from
the Supreme Court and conservative
interests, unions are fighting back. We
have seen tens of thousands of teachers
taking to the streets in cities and
States across the country demanding
and in many cases securing more in-
vestment in schools, smaller class
sizes, and a living wage for teachers.
In the year since Janus, public sector
employee unions like AFSCME are
adding thousands of new dues-paying
members energized to fight back
against the conservative assault on
unions’ very existence.
Our public employee unions are doing
their job to stay in the fight and Con-
gress needs to do its part. That is why
I joined 35 of my Senate colleagues and
27 of my House colleagues this week to
introduce the Public Service Freedom
to Negotiate Act of 2019.
This legislation affirms to all 17.3
million public sector workers nation-
wide that we value their service to the
public and that we are fighting to pro-
tect their voice in the workplace.
Our bill codifies the right of public
employees to organize, act concertedly,
and bargain collectively in States that
currently do not afford these basic
rights.
Under our legislation, States have
wide flexibility to write and administer
their own labor laws, provided they
meet the standards established in this
legislation, and it will not preempt
laws in States that substantially meet
or exceed this standard.
The right to organize shouldn’t de-
pend on whether or not your State has
robust worker protections, like the
State of Hawaii, and workers shouldn’t
be held captive to the anti-union bent
of the Roberts Five on the Supreme
Court.
The fight to protect the right to or-
ganize is not an abstract issue. Unions
have lifted people into the middle
class, especially women and people of
color.
I speak from personal experience.
When I was a young child, my mother
worked for years in low-wage jobs that
provided no job security, no
healthcare, and no stability. We lived
paycheck to paycheck. That all
changed when my mother and her co-
workers organized and formed a union.
That union happens to be the CWA.
Unionization brought job and eco-
nomic security to our family. Our pub-
lic employee unions are fighting on be-
half of millions of people across our
country who are serving our commu-
nities. They are our teachers, our fire-
fighters, social workers, EMTs, and our
police officers. They are us.
These are not normal times. We all
need to come together to fight back
against an all-out assault on working
people.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio.
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I want to
first of all thank Senator HIRONO for
introducing one of the most important
bills this session. It is all about collec-
tive bargaining rights. It is all about
workers’ voices being heard and all
about the dignity of work.
Just last week I was with Senator
HIRONO with a number of her constitu-
ents from her State, and they talked
about her support for manufacturing or
especially her support for workers. I
was particularly pleased when she men-
tioned the Communications Workers of
America. I have staff with me on the
floor—some of my Ohio staff, including
my State director, who came out of the
CWA. I know how important workers’
rights are. So I thank Senator HIRONO
for introducing this bill. If we did noth-
ing this session but pass that legisla-
tion, it would be a huge victory for
workers.
Unfortunately, we have a Supreme
Court that puts its thumb on the scales
of justice in every case, choosing cor-
porations over workers, choosing Wall
Street over consumers, choosing, in far
too many cases, health insurance com-
panies over sick people. And today’s
Supreme Court case is aimed and tar-
geted directly at States like mine,
Ohio, a State that is a swing State and
has 12 Republican House Members, 4
Democratic House Members and has
had that same configuration of 12 and 4
for 4 State elections because of redis-
tricting. But it is no surprise, with the
Supreme Court deciding that they were

going to put their thumb on the scale
of justice again, against voting rights,
against civil rights. That is what has
happened in support of corporate
money.
So dark money has affected the spe-
cial-interest Supreme Court. We have
never seen a Supreme Court in my life-
time that is this beholden to corporate
interests, that is this beholden to bil-
lionaire contributors, that is this be-
holden to special interests. We have
never seen a Court like this.
What does this mean? It means that
instead of citizens choosing their elect-
ed officials, it is politicians choosing
whom they represent. That is why you
get these districts that will stay 12-to-
4 Republican, where voters have no real
say in these elections because of the
way it is lined up.
We have a Supreme Court that is hos-
tile to voting rights, hostile to worker
rights, hostile to women’s rights, hos-
tile to LGBTQ rights. That is what this
Supreme Court has given us, as Sen-
ator MCCONNELL, in his office down the
hall, continues to push judges like this
who don’t look toward the public inter-
est. They are always looking toward
rewarding their billionaire contribu-
tors.
Again, I thank Senator HIRONO for
her work.

f
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—
S. 386
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise today
to speak about the Fairness for High-
Skilled Immigrants Act, an important
and bipartisan piece of legislation on
which I have been a proud sponsor and
on which I have been proud to work
with Senator HARRIS to bring this bill
to fruition.
It has been many years in the mak-
ing, and I am pleased to stand behind
this legislation and to push it forward.
There is no question that immigration
is one of the most important and also
politically fraught and politically
charged issues in front of Congress
right now. More often than not, we
can’t even seem to agree on what the
problems in our immigration system
are, let alone come to an agreement
about how best to solve them.
That makes it all the more impor-
tant for us at least to come together to
get something done in those areas
where we can find common ground and
do so across party lines on issues that
are neither Republican or Democratic,
neither liberal or conservative, but
that are simply American issues that
are central to who we are.
We are great as a country not be-
cause of who we are but because of
what we do, because of the fact that we
choose freedom, we choose to be wel-
coming, and we choose to be that shin-
ing city on the hill, where anyone can
come into this country, be born or im-
migrate into this country as a poor
person, and hope and have the reason-
able expectation that one day, if they
work hard and play by the rules, they
might have the opportunity to retire
comfortably, in some cases wealthy.
We have to find common ground in
these areas. The Fairness for High-
Skilled Immigrants Act is an impor-
tant point of common ground.
Employment-based immigration
visas—the one significant area of our
immigration system based on skills
and based on merit—are currently
issued in accordance with rigid, arbi-
trary, antiquated, and outdated per-
country quotas. This means that in a
given year, immigrants from any one
given country cannot, in most cases, be
given more than 7 percent of the total
number of visas allocated. As a result
of this, immigrants from nations with
large populations have significantly
longer wait times to get a green card
than do immigrants from smaller coun-
tries. In some cases, they could be
stuck in a backlog of green card peti-
tions for decades.
This makes no sense. This is arbi-
trary. It is capricious. It is unfair. It is
un-American. It is not what we do.
This is one of the many features of our
Buddy Holly/Elvis Presley-era immi-
gration code that are outdated and
that need to be cast into the dustbin of
history. These per-country visa caps
cause serious problems for good people,
for American businesses and American
workers alike, and they cause unfair,
undue, and immense hardship for the
immigrants who happen to be unfortu-
nate enough to be stuck in that very
backlog.
While employment-based green cards
are supposed to go to immigrants with
high skills who will help grow the
American economy, the per-country
caps distort this system by causing
some immigrants to wait years before
receiving a green card for a reason that
may be totally unrelated and generally
is completely detached from their
qualifications. This undermines our
ability to bring the best and the
brightest individuals to our country. It
is to our harm, and it is to our own
shame.
Further, the per-country caps force
the immigrants that are stuck in this
backlog—95 percent of whom are al-
ready inside the United States—to
make the difficult choice between, on
the one hand, staying in America and
waiting decades for a green card, or on
the other hand, leaving and taking
their talents to a country that provides
a fairer process for allocating legal im-
migrant status as a worker.
Worse still, because individuals in
the green card backlog can only spon-
sor temporary visas for their children
while these children are younger than
21, the per-country caps force families
to choose between separating and send-
ing their children back to their coun-
try of origin as they age out of their
visas while their parents keep waiting
in the United States for their own op-
portunity to receive a green card or
giving up entirely on their dreams of
becoming lawful permanent residents
within the United States of America.
In many cases, these are children who
legally immigrated with their parents
and did so at an early age and who
have come to call America their home,
adopting our customs, our language,
our ways of life, having been educated
here and socialized here.
Because immigrants in the backlog
are also severely limited in their abil-
ity to change jobs, the per-country
caps often force them to work under
conditions that other employees would
justifiably and understandably find
completely unacceptable. This exposes
these immigrants to harassment, ex-
ploitation, and abuse, without any op-
tion of switching employers. What is
more, because these employees can’t
switch jobs, they have less power to ne-
gotiate fair salaries, which depresses
wages not only for these immigrant
workers themselves but also for their
colleagues, whether or not they are
American citizens.
Fortunately, the solution to these
problems is not only straightforward
but agreed upon by a broad, bipartisan
coalition of lawmakers. We must elimi-
nate the per-country caps to ensure a
fair and reasonable allocation of em-
ployment-based green cards. That is
exactly what the Fairness for High-
Skilled Immigrants Act would accom-
plish, and that is exactly what this bill
is all about.
Without the per-country caps, our
skills-based green card system would
operate on a first-come, first-serve
basis, ensuring that immigrants are ad-
mitted into the United States purely
based on merit rather than on the arbi-
trary, outdated, unreasonable basis of
their country of origin. This, after all,
is what the American dream has often
been about. It is about who we are as a
people rather than where our parents
came from, who they were, what they
looked like, and what language they
might have spoken.
This reform would also ensure that
the hardships caused by decades-long
wait times would be eliminated.
Importantly, the Fairness for High-
Skilled Immigrants Act also contains
critical safeguards to ensure that the
transition from the per-country cap
system to a first-come, first-served sys-
tem would occur smoothly and without
unduly disrupting existing immigra-
tion flows. Specifically, this bill in-
cludes a 3-year set-aside of green cards
for immigrants who are not in the
backlog to ensure that they can con-
tinue to enter the country as we proc-
ess backlog petitions.
In addition, the bill contains an im-
portant ‘‘do no harm’’ provision to
make certain that green card appli-
cants who are at the front of the line
now will stay at the front of the line
and not be faced with new delays as we
work through the backlog during this
transition process. These provisions
will ensure that we are truly treating
all immigrants in the employment-
based system fairly.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4619
June 27, 2019
For many years, this critical legisla-
tion was stalled because of the con-
cerns of some Members that any re-
form to the employment-based visa
system should be accompanied by new
protections against fraud and abuse in
the H–1B program. To address those
concerns this Congress, I negotiated an
amendment to the Fairness for High-
Skilled Immigrants Act with Senator
GRASSLEY to include new protections
for American workers in how we proc-
ess applications for H–1B visas.
This amendment negotiated with
Senator GRASSLEY does three things:
First, the Grassley amendment would
strengthen the Department of Labor’s
ability to investigate and enforce labor
condition application requirements. In
addition, it would reform the labor
condition application process to ensure
complete and adequate disclosure of in-
formation regarding the employer’s H–
1B hiring practices. Finally, it would
close loopholes by which employers
could otherwise circumvent the annual
cap on H–1B workers.
Importantly, the Grassley amend-
ment—like the underlying bill itself—
consists of provisions that have long
enjoyed support from Members of this
body on both sides of the aisle and
from every point along the ideological
spectrum. They are drawn from an H–
1B reform bill that has been cham-
pioned both by Senator GRASSLEY and
by Senator DURBIN.
I am grateful that Senator GRASSLEY
was willing to come to the table and
work in good faith on achieving a rea-
sonable compromise on this bill. I be-
lieve the deal we have struck is a fair
and evenhanded way to address long-
standing concerns about our H–1B sys-
tem while eliminating country-of-ori-
gin discrimination in how we allocate
skills-based green cards.
The reason the Fairness for High-
Skilled Immigrants Act enjoys such
broad, solemn, deep, and unwavering
bipartisan support is because it does
not include any of the typical partisan
poison pills and other controversial
provisions that so often undermine and
in many cases doom other immigration
reform efforts. This is a narrow, sur-
gical reform—one that is necessary,
one that is palatable, and one that is
long overdue.
I would like to conclude by thanking
Senator HARRIS, who has been an inde-
fatigable partner with me on this bill.
I have been proud to work side by side
with her to eliminate the country-of-
origin discrimination and bring about a
system of fairness in how we allocate
employment-based green cards.
This is an important and, indeed, es-
sential reform to our immigration laws
and one that has been a long time com-
ing.
Mr. President, I therefore ask unani-
mous consent that the Committee on
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of S. 386 and that
the Senate proceed to its immediate
consideration. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Grassley amendment at
the desk be agreed to; that the bill, as
amended, be considered read a third
time and passed; and that the motions
to reconsider be considered made and
laid upon the table.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky.
Mr. PAUL. Reserving the right to ob-
ject, I have offered a modest com-
promise amendment to this legislation.
I stand ready and open to negotiate
and discuss this. We have often dis-
cussed it in private and in public. I will
object until we can get to negotiating
terms, and we can hopefully pass this
bill once we enter into a dialogue.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Utah.
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I approach
with great sadness and disappointment
the response just brought about by my
distinguished colleague, my friend, the
junior Senator from Kentucky. I have a
great deal of respect for him. The fact
that he and I have worked on so many
issues side by side together in order to
improve government makes this not
easier but makes it more difficult.
The reforms to which my distin-
guished colleague, the junior Senator
from Kentucky, refers are themselves
born of a genuine desire to improve our
immigration system. But, alas, the re-
forms he has proposed are not, in my
view, compatible with the scope of this
bill, nor are they compatible with
something that can reasonably pass
through this body. That is one of the
reasons I have introduced the legisla-
tion as I have.
I worked on this nearly the entirety
of the 81⁄2 half years I have had the op-
portunity and great privilege to serve
the people of Utah in the Senate. This
is by far the closest we have ever come
to having a deal, and we achieved that
deal by keeping this bill focused on the
very things this legislation deals with.
The suggestions that Senator PAUL
has made, while born of great concern
for our country and a noble degree of
commitment to serving the people of
his State, are not themselves compat-
ible with the scope of this legislation,
nor are they compatible with what
would likely be passed by this body.
We have an opportunity right now to
pass this. This could pass this body
right now. I find it greatly dis-
appointing that my colleague and my
friend has chosen not to allow this to
pass this body today. This is something
that could and should and otherwise
would pass this body today without
that objection.
I would respectfully but with all the
urgency I am capable of commu-
nicating implore my colleague, the dis-
tinguished Senator from Kentucky, to
reconsider his objection and allow this
to pass.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.

Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to call up Udall
amendment No. 883.

The legislative clerk read as follows:
The Senator from New Mexico [Mr.
UDALL], for himself and others, proposes an
amendment numbered 883 to S. 1790, as
amended.
Mr. UDALL. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the reading of the amend-
ment be dispensed with.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
The amendment, as amended, is as
follows:
(Purpose: To prohibit unauthorized military
operations in or against Iran)
At the end of subtitle C of title XII of the
amendment, add the following:
SEC. 1226. PROHIBITION OF UNAUTHORIZED
MILITARY OPERATIONS AGAINST
IRAN.
(a) IN GENERAL.—No funds authorized by
this Act may be used to conduct hostilities
against the Government of Iran, against the
Armed Forces of Iran, or in the territory of
Iran.
(b) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in
this section may be construed—
(1) to restrict the use of the United States
Armed Forces to defend against an attack
upon the United States, its territories or
possessions, or its Armed Forces;
(2) to limit the obligations under the War
Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.); or
(3) to affect the provisions of an Act or a
joint resolution of Congress specifically au-
thorizing such hostilities that is enacted
after the date of the enactment of this Act.
Mr. UDALL. I ask for the yeas and
nays.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a
sufficient second?
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.
The yeas and nays are ordered.
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak on my
amendment.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I rise to
respond to some of the criticisms of the
Udall amendment that I believe are
misleading and deserve a response.
To start, I want to point out an area
of agreement. The opposition says our
amendment is simple, and it agrees on
its intent—that this amendment would
prohibit a war with Iran without there
being congressional approval, and that
is what the vote is about. The argu-
ments from those in the opposition
mislead to avoid that simple truth.
They are trying to create excuses for
why we should ignore the Constitution
and open the door to war with Iran
without having a vote. President

Critics say we only have one Com-
mander in Chief, not 535, and so we
should not pass this amendment.
We agree. We only have one Com-
mander in Chief, but the Commander in
Chief executes wars. Only Congress can
declare them. Our Founders made that
decision for good reason. Dictators and
Kings declare war unilaterally. Democ-
racies don’t. In our democracy, the
people decide whether we go to war or
whether we don’t go to war through
their elected representatives. Congress
is the most direct voice of the people.
Once that decision has been made,
then it is up to one Commander in
Chief to execute that war. The people
of New Mexico did not send me here to
be a battalion commander or a general,
and I have no intention of acting like
one. The people of New Mexico sent me
here to do my constitutional duty, and
article I, section 8 vests the power of
declaring war with the Congress.
Critics also falsely say our amend-
ment limits our forces’ ability to de-
fend themselves or take incoming fire
before they can respond. The majority
leader said our amendment defines
‘‘self-defense’’ too narrowly.
I am confused at what he is referring
to. Our amendment does not include a
separate definition of ‘‘self-defense.’’
Our amendment expressly states that
it does not restrict ‘‘the use of the
United States Armed Forces to defend
against attack.’’ This language does
not, in any way, change the Depart-
ment of Defense’s rules of engagement
that guide how to exercise our inherent
right of self-defense. The DOD does not
require a unit to absorb an attack be-
fore it can defend itself, and neither
does our amendment.
The only restriction in the amend-
ment is that the President cannot
enter into hostilities without having
congressional approval. It is a restric-
tion that is embedded in our Constitu-
tion. If the Republicans are proposing
to do away with that restriction, I
agree with my colleague Senator
MERKLEY that they must come to the
floor and propose a constitutional
amendment to do so.
Our forces in Iraq, Bahrain, and other
locations in the Middle East are fully
capable and empowered to defend
themselves, and this amendment does
not affect that. Unfortunately, the op-
position is just repeating itself, trying
to generate a reason to abdicate its
own constitutional duty.
We have also heard criticism that
this amendment is ‘‘appeasing the Aya-
tollahs’’ and represents ‘‘weakness’’
and that we must allow the President
to launch military action to be tough.
We have heard these kinds of argu-
ments before. They were very common
in the run up to the disastrous Iraq
war. Do not question the arguments for
war. To do so is to be weak.
I could not disagree more.
Our Constitution is our strength, and
this amendment simply reaffirms our
Constitution in the face of a President
who is threatening to flout it. Our Na-
tion is strong when we are united. We
do not need to give up congressional
authority over war and peace to one
man, the President, in order to be
strong.
Congress has authorized military ac-
tion before, and when majorities be-
lieve that the circumstances warrant
it, Congress will do so again. If we fear
Iran so much that we are willing to
walk away from the constitutional re-
quirements to authorize military ac-
tion, that would be the real sign of
weakness.
We have also heard that we cannot
rely on Congress to authorize force if
we need it to. We heard that Congress
can barely name a post office. So how
can we trust it with this kind of deci-
sion? What if Congress is out of town
and cannot vote?
First, it is disappointing to hear
Members of the Senate speak so cyni-
cally about this body on the floor dur-
ing a debate as important as this. The
Congress does not function perfectly.
That is very true. Yet history is clear
that Congress has authorized military
force many times in the past. I have
supported some, and I have opposed
others, but we had debates and votes.
Only recently has the 2001 authoriza-
tion been so abused to authorize mili-
tary action all over the globe—far be-
yond the al-Qaida and Afghanistan
mission that Congress thought it was
voting on.
Congress, though, has had these de-
bates and has voted, and those deci-
sions represent our national decisions.
I see no reason to turn our back on our
Constitution just because Iran is a re-
gional threat and this administration
has manufactured a crisis to exacer-
bate that threat.
If there is a national security crisis
that requires Congress to vote on mili-
tary force, we can all get on a plane
and come to Washington and do our
jobs. Maybe we will even have a vote
on Friday. Congress voted after Pearl
Harbor, and Congress voted after 9/11.
Both were in the middle of national
crises. Our troops will be the ones mak-
ing real sacrifices. We can bear the
cost of some inconvenient recess trav-
el. Our job is to debate and vote on
matters of war and peace—period, end
of story.
We have also heard that the Depart-
ment of Defense is opposed to our
amendment.
Yesterday, Mr. John Rood, the Under
Secretary for Policy at the Department
of Defense, sent a letter to the leaders
of the Armed Services Committee in
its opposition to our amendment. The
letter is short, and while it contains
speculation and rhetoric, it includes no
legal analysis and fails to address the
plain language of the amendment or
longstanding DOD authority or rules of
engagement.
I am disappointed in the letter, but it
should not be a surprise from a polit-
ical appointee from the Trump admin-
istration, not when the President is
openly declaring that he needs no au-
thority from Congress to launch a war
against Iran. The letter reads that the
amendment ‘‘purports to limit the
President’s authority in discharging
his responsibility as Commander in
Chief,’’ which is simply false.
The amendment straightforwardly
affirms the constitutional authority of
Congress to authorize military action—
authority that the President is openly
flouting in his public comments.
If Congress authorizes military ac-
tion against Iran, the Commander in
Chief would be free to execute it.
The letter asserts, without evidence,
that our amendment will embolden
Iran. I hope we are not so weak that we
think our Constitution emboldens Iran.
Overall, the letter cites nothing—the
Constitution, no law, no DOD policy,
no legal analysis, nothing—in support
of its claims.
This letter from DOD, which lacks a
confirmed Secretary, is a disappoint-
ment, but it should not be read as any
authoritative take on this amendment,
its intent, or its effect.
Some have said that this amendment
would block the United States from
helping Israel defend itself from an Ira-
nian attack. I support Israel’s right to
defend itself, and this argument does
not hold up.
First, this amendment has no impact
on our ongoing security assistance and
cooperation with Israel, including the
recent MOU signed with Israel by
President Obama.
Second, if Israel is attacked, there is
nothing in this amendment that would
prohibit the United States from com-
ing to its aid with defensive measures.
Third, if Israel is attacked and the
United States wants to send our mili-
tary to engage in direct hostilities, we
are going to need to debate and author-
ize any response in Congress. That is
simply what the Constitution says.
Finally, the biggest risk of Iranian
attacks on Israel, according to one
Israeli Cabinet Minister last month, is
the escalating tension between the
United States and Iran.
The best thing we can do to protect
Israel is diplomacy to stop a broader
regional war in the Middle East. If the
United States does go to war with Iran,
Israel is likely to face very serious
threats, and that is something we
should take seriously if we consider the
use of force.
Israeli Energy Minister Yuval
Steinitz said in May that ‘‘things are
heating up’’ in the Persian Gulf.
He said:
If there’s some sort of conflagration be-
tween Iran and the United States, between
Iran and its neighbors, I’m not ruling out
that they will activate Hezbollah and Is-
lamic Jihad from Gaza, or even that they
will try to fire missiles from Iran at the
State of Israel.
So the threats to Israel from Iran
only make it more important that we
have a full debate and vote on military
action, not less important.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4621
June 27, 2019
Again, the purpose of our amendment
is simple: The President is threatening
to launch military action against Iran
without authorization, publicly flout-
ing Congress. This amendment says
that we are not going to go into an un-
authorized war with Iran.
If the President and Members of this
body think we need to take military
action against Iran, then let’s have
that debate and let’s vote.
The Udall amendment ensures we fol-
low the constitutional process. To do
otherwise is to be in dereliction of our
constitutional duty.
Mr. ROMNEY. Will the Senator from
New Mexico yield for a question?
Mr. UDALL. The Senator from New
Mexico yields the floor.
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I very
much appreciate the perspective and
sincere thoughts and ideas coming
from my good friend from New Mexico.
The Senator indicated that those
who oppose this are trying to create
excuses for why we should ignore the
Constitution.
I would note that in my remarks this
morning I noted specifically that this
is not an authorization to use military
force against Iran or anyone else. It is
a statement of continued commitment
to our national defense, and, precisely,
it is saying that under the Constitution
only Congress may declare war. That is
something I said specifically.
But the Senator goes on to note—he
says that only the Congress—specifi-
cally, his words are ‘‘ignore the Con-
stitution, open the door to war with
Iran without a vote.’’
President Trump has said he was 10
minutes away from doing just that. Is
the Senator saying that if the Presi-
dent were to do what he was contem-
plating, and that is to take out missile
batteries with the potential of the loss
of life of as many of 150, but also it
could be with a prewarning, with no
loss of life, but taking out missile bat-
teries that have fired upon an Amer-
ican aircraft—unmanned American air-
craft—if he were to have done that in
response to their shooting down an air-
craft in international airspace, that
constitutes going to war and would
have required a vote of Congress to au-
thorize shooting down or attacking
missile batteries that have fired rock-
ets at an American airship?
I am referring to the Senator’s com-
ments precisely, and I will read the en-
tire point.
The Senator said: ‘‘They are trying
to create excuses for why we should ig-
nore the Constitution and open the
door to war with Iran without a vote.’’
President Trump has said that he was
10 minutes away from doing just that.
So in the Senator’s view, is responding
in a very limited manner, as he was
contemplating, taking out missile bat-
teries potentially—would that have
constituted going to war and required
the vote of Congress?
That is my question, because I be-
lieve that is not the case. I believe the
President has the constitutional au-
thority and duty to respond, if nec-
essary, in an appropriate way to return
fire on the very batteries that have
shot down an American aircraft.
I yield the floor.
f
TRIBUTE TO BLAIR
BRETTSCHNEIDER
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want
to tell you about two young women
from Chicago and a discovery they
made together that has helped to
transform the lives of hundreds of
other young women.
Domitira Nahishakiye moved with
her family from the African nation of
Burundi to Chicago in 2007. Three years
later, she found herself overwhelmed.
At 18, she was attending high school,
trying to prepare for college, and car-
ing for her three younger siblings.
The refugee resettlement efforts
worked mostly with boys and young
men. It didn’t offer many programs to
help Domi balance the pressures of car-
ing for her siblings and preparing for
college. Getting ready for college is
tough for almost everyone. Imagine
how much harder it is if you have
grown up in another culture and you
are helping to care for three siblings.
Fortunately, Domi met another
young woman named Blair
Brettschneider.
Blair grew up in Detroit. After grad-
uating from the University of Miami in
Florida, she had hoped to become a
journalist, but the Great Recession
caused Blair to rethink her career
path. She moved to Chicago to work
for AmeriCorps VISTA, sometimes
called the domestic Peace Corps. Blair
was a ‘‘gofer’’ for the refugee resettle-
ment agency.
Not content with coffee runs and
other ‘‘busy work,’’ Blair started talk-
ing to the families her agency was
helping. That is how she met Domi.
Blair started to tutor Domi and help
her with her homework at the after-
school center, but Domi’s home respon-
sibilities made it difficult for her to at-
tend the sessions regularly.
Rather than give up, Blair started tu-
toring Domi at her home. She helped
her master her studies and apply for
college. She also helped Domi adapt to
life in her new homeland.
Blair realized that Domi was not
alone. Many immigrant girls and
young women Blair spoke with shared
the same needs, and many refugee
agencies just weren’t set up to help
them.
That realization led Blair to estab-
lish a foundation in 2011 to provide
other young women refugees in
Chicagoland with the same types of
support that Blair offered Domi. It is
called GirlForward. It has since ex-
panded its reach to help young women
in Austin, TX, as well. Since 2011,
GirlForward has helped nearly 300 ref-
ugee women in the Chicago area and in
Austin find mentors, friends, support,
and encouragement in America.
Amina Imran, a refugee from Paki-
stan, is one of those fortunate young
women. She used to joke that the only
way she could attend college is if she
robbed a bank, but after finishing the
Chicago GirlForward program in 2017,
she now attends North Park University
in Chicago, on a scholarship.
GirlForward is routinely cited as one
of the best charities in Chicago. Read-
er’s Digest declared GirlForward the
Best of America.
My visits to GirlForward in Chicago
were some of the happiest moments on
my schedule. Young women from every
comer of the world found friendship
and encouragement with their peers.
The processes of assimilating language
and culture were lifted as these amaz-
ing young women came together and
shared their struggles and joys.
In helping young women refugees to
thrive in their new home, Blair
Brettschneider is following in the foot-
steps of another great Chicagoan. In
1889, Jane Addams founded Hull House
on the Near West Side of Chicago. It
was one of America’s first settlement
houses, where new citizens could ac-
quire domestic and job skills and learn
about American Government and cus-
toms. For her work with Hull House
and other social justice causes, Jane
Aaclams became the first American
woman ever to receive the Nobel Peace
Prize.
GirlForward is a new version of Hull
House.
In July, Blair will be leaving
GirlForward. Fortunately, she leaves
the GirlForward programs in
Chicagoland and in Austin in strong
shape.
On behalf of the hundreds of young
women whose lives GirlForward has
helped enrich and transform and the
hundreds of young women who will fol-
low them, I want to thank Blair
Brettschneider for her remarkable
work and wish her all the best in her
new efforts.

NATIONAL DEFENSE
AUTHORIZATION ACT
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, today I
wish to discuss Senate amendment No.
861, offered by our colleague from Utah.
The author of the amendment, Sen-
ator ROMNEY, and others have made
clear that this language does not con-
stitute an authorization of the use of
military force, or AUMF. I agree with
that assessment.
While this amendment appears to re-
state existing Presidential authority to
defend the country in the event of an
attack, it includes other language that
could be interpreted to provide more
authority to the President. That con-
cerns me, which is why I voted against
this amendment.
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President,
amendment No. 861 fully captures the
utter failure of the modern Congress to
assert and defend congressional war
powers that the U.S. Constitution sole-
ly vests in the legislative branch. It
treats matters of life and death as
mere fodder for political ‘‘gotcha’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4622 June 27, 2019
votes and represents an approach to
legislating that is ultimately as sim-
plistic as it is dangerous.
If one asked 10 attorneys to analyze
the text of amendment No. 861, one
might very well receive 10 wildly dif-
ferent interpretations of what the un-
defined terms in the amendment mean,
from the use of the term ‘‘attack by
the government, military forces, or
proxies of a foreign nation or by other
hostile forces’’ to the phrase ‘‘used to
ensure the ability of the Armed Forces
of the United States to defend them-
selves, and United States citizens.’’
As the authors plausibly argue, the
intent of the amendment may very
well be to simply reaffirm existing
legal interpretations and norms that
authorize the U.S. Armed Forces to de-
fend itself and our citizens against at-
tack by a foreign nation or other hos-
tile force. As supporters argue, the
amendment language avoids using the
specific phrase ‘‘authorization for use
of military force,’’ and thus one may
argue that it is technically not an
‘‘AUMF.’’
Yet adopting such an interpretation
requires ignoring years of executive
branch overreach when it comes to
taking unilateral military action with-
out seeking an authorization for use of
military force or a declaration of war
from Congress.
It requires willfully forgetting the
behavior of our current President and
past Presidents of both parties, who
have chosen to define the concept of
Commander in Chief under Article II of
the U.S. Constitution to be less a com-
mander and more an emperor while the
legislative branch has sat idly by as its
war powers were rapidly seized by the
modem imperial Presidency.
Congress is a coequal branch of gov-
ernment. It is time we started acting
like it. We cannot trust any President
to take a blank check and fill in a rea-
sonable number. I must oppose amend-
ment 861 because, in my reading, any
President of any party would adopt the
broadest legal interpretation possible
in defining what constitutes an ‘‘other
hostile force’’ or an ‘‘attack’’ or what
it means to ‘‘ensure the ability of the
Armed Forces of the U.S. to defend
themselves.’’
This language risks unintentionally
authorizing President Trump to order
all types of military strikes against
any number of potential entities that
the President deems to be a threat.
How would the Trump administration
determine the precise baseline that de-
fines the term ‘‘ability’’ of the military
to defend itself? Would allowing the
degradation of any platform or capa-
bility qualify as failing to ‘‘ensure the
ability’’ of the U.S. Armed Forces to
defend itself? If so, that would author-
ize the use of funds in the National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2020 to take unilateral, preemptive ac-
tion again a foreign nation or hostile
force to preserve the current capabili-
ties of the U.S. military.
I am confident the author of this
amendment would disagree with this
interpretation of his legislative lan-
guage. However, would the sponsor
argue that such an interpretation is
unreasonable or not possible? Would a
Federal Court not defer to the Federal
Agency’s interpretation of a vague and
ambiguous statute? I do not know the
answer to either question; yet I know
this: I am not willing to take that risk.
We are living with the consequences
of a previous Congress that rushed to
pass a concise authorization for use of
military force that appeared targeted
and limited at first. We have watched
as Republican and Democratic admin-
istrations alike subsequently employed
creative and broad legal interpreta-
tions of that authorization to contin-
ually expand which parties were con-
nected with the horrific terrorist at-
tacks of September 11, 2001.
To this very day, the Trump adminis-
tration cites this authorization for use
of military force as legal justification
to unilaterally deploy Americans all
around the world, even though it was
authorized in response to an event that
took place before some of these troops
were even born. To be clear, I am not
asserting that I oppose the premise or
substantive motivation of every mili-
tary action that has taken place under
the recent Presidential administra-
tions. I am simply stating that such
actions must be debated and voted on
by Congress.
I deployed to fight in a war I person-
ally opposed because it was ordered by
the Commander in Chief, and these or-
ders were pursuant to an authorization
for use of military force that was pub-
licly debated and passed by a majority
of our Nation’s elected representatives.
Opposing a vaguely worded amendment
whose own author and proponents as-
sert is duplicative and unnecessary and
which I believe may unintentionally
open the door to unlimited unilateral
military action, ultimately is a vote to
make our Nation stronger, more ac-
countable, and a more perfect union in
living out the principles contained in
our founding document.
Critics may falsely allege that oppos-
ing amendment No. 861 is voting
against our national defense and mili-
tary. I will strongly reject any such ri-
diculous claim that slanders me with
the accusation that I would ever risk
the security and safety of the Nation I
have proudly served in uniform. In vot-
ing against amendment No. 861, I am
safeguarding our military from exces-
sive use without congressional over-
sight. I am simply making clear that
we, in Congress, must begin exercising
the same care and attention in doing
our job as our troops do when exe-
cuting their missions downrange.
One of my primary motivations for
serving the great State of Illinois in
the U.S. Senate is to help restore con-
gressional war powers. To remind my
colleagues that whether one favors
military action or opposes the use of
military force, every Member of Con-
gress should agree that such matters
deserve to be debated and carefully
considered by our Nation’s duly elected
representatives in the broad light of
day. To remind my colleagues that we
must always demand the Commander
in Chief clearly outline our desired
strategic end state before authorizing
military action that puts our troops in
harm’s way.
The bottom line is that only Con-
gress has the power to declare war. We
are the ones tasked with deciding when
and how we send Americans into com-
bat. We are the ones the Constitution
charged with that most solemn duty.
For too long, too many elected offi-
cials have avoided the responsibility
and burden of declaring war. Fearing
electoral risks and staring down com-
ing elections, multiple Congresses have
shirked their constitutional responsi-
bility to our troops by refusing to re-
peal the existing authorization for use
of military force, while avoiding con-
sideration any new authorizations for
use of military force. Enough—enough
of being so worried about political con-
sequences that we fail to do our own
jobs, even as we expect our troops to do
theirs without complaint every day.
We need to do better by our
servicemembers. We owe it to them to
honor their sacrifices. Part of that
means ensuring that no American
sheds blood in a war Congress has not
authorized, or unintentionally author-
ized by passing vague language such as
in amendment No. 861 that can be
twisted to be read as empowering
President Trump to take preemptive
military action.
We should be disciplined in forcing
any President who wishes to go to war
to bring their case to Congress and give
the American people a vote through
their elected representatives. That is
how we truly respect our
servicemembers and military families:
by demanding debate that is honest
and clear-eyed about the likely loss of
life and the risks of escalation that ac-
company any use of force. It is our
duty, and it is the least we can do for
those willing to risk their lives in safe-
guarding our democracy, our way of
life, and our Constitution.
So with the drums of war beating
louder and louder by the day, I must
oppose amendment No. 861 and keep
my promise to all who served or are
serving now in defense of this country
we love. I must continue seeking to
hold all of us who have the honor of
serving in Congress accountable for
taking back congressional war powers.
Moving forward, I urge the leadership
of the Senate and House Armed Serv-
ices Committees to work with me to
strike or significantly restrict this lan-
guage during the conference negotia-
tions that will take place over the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for
Fiscal Year 2020.

June 27, 2019
Health Education, Labor and Pensions
Committee be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS ACT
Mr. ALEXANDER. Today we are voting on
three bills:
First, the Poison Center Network Enhance-
ment Act, offered by Senators Murray and
Burr, to reauthorize and update the national
network of poison control centers.
Second, the Emergency Medical Services
for Children Program Reauthorization Act,
offered by Senator Casey and me, to ensure
that, from the ambulance to the emergency
room, emergency health care providers are
fully prepared to treat children, who typi-
cally require smaller equipment and dif-
ferent doses of medicine .
Third, the Lower Health Care Costs Act—a
package of 54 proposals from 65 senators—29
Republican and 36 Democrat, including near-
ly every member of this Committee—that
will reduce what Americans pay out of their
own pockets for health care.
The Lower Health Care Costs Act will re-
duce what Americans pay out of their pock-
ets for health care in three major ways:
First, it ends surprise billing. Second, it cre-
ates more transparency—there are twelve bi-
partisan provisions that will: eliminate gag
clauses and anti-competitive terms in insur-
ance contracts, designate a non-profit entity
to unlock insurance claims for employers,
ban Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBM) from
charging more for a drug than the PBM paid
for the drug, and require that patients re-
ceive more information on the cost and qual-
ity of their health care. You can’t lower your
health care costs until you know what your
health care actually costs. And third, it in-
creases prescription drug competition—there
are fourteen bipartisan provisions to help
more lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs
reach patients.
This legislation also extends mandatory
funding for community health centers, and
four additional public health programs, to
ensure the 27 million Americans who rely on
these centers for primary care and other
health care can continue to access care close
to home, offered by Senator Murray and me,
along with Senators Casey, Cramer, Klo-
buchar, and Murkowski.
We have paid for this extension for five
years with savings from other parts of the
larger bill, which will prevent the uncer-
tainty and anxiety of short-term extensions.
The Managers Amendment we are voting
on today includes two additional, significant
provisions: First, a bill from Senators
McConnell and Kaine that will raise the min-
imum age for purchasing any tobacco prod-
uct from 18 to 21. This has also been a pri-
ority of Senators Young, Romney, Roberts,
Murkowski, Collins, Schatz, and others.
And two, from Senators Grassley and
Leahy, and many others, the CREATES Act,
which will help bring more lower cost ge-
neric drugs to patients by eliminating anti-
competitive practices by brand drug makers.
Altogether, this legislation will help to
lower the cost of health care, which has be-
come a tax on family budgets and on busi-
nesses, on federal and state governments.
A recent Gallup poll found that the cost of
health care was the biggest financial prob-
lem facing American families. And last July,
this Committee heard from Dr. Brent James,
from the National Academies, who testified
that up to half of what the American people
spend on health care may be unnecessary.
Over the last two years, this Committee
has held 16 hearings on a wide range of topics
related to reducing the cost of health care—
specifically, how do we reduce what the
American people pay out of their own pock-
ets for health care.
Last December, I sent a letter to experts at
the American Enterprise Institute and the
Brookings Institution, and to doctors, econo-
mists, governors, insurers, employers, and
other health care innovators, asking for spe-
cific steps Congress could take to lower the
cost of health care.
We received over 400 recommendations,
some as many as 50 pages long. In May, Sen-
ator Murray and I released for discussion the
Lower Health Care Costs Act. Since then,
we’ve received over 400 additional comments
on our draft legislation, and last Tuesday,
we held a hearing to hear additional feed-
back.
Last Wednesday, Senator Murray and I for-
mally introduced the Lower Health Care
Costs Act—a bipartisan package of 54 pro-
posals from 65 senators that will reduce what
Americans pay out of their own pockets for
health care.
At our hearing on this legislation last
week, Ben Ippolito, an economics and health
fellow at the American Enterprise Institute,
said:‘‘Together, the provisions in this bill
would meaningfully increase competition
and transparency in health care markets. If
enacted, this legislation would lower insur-
ance premiums and drug prices for con-
sumers, and would ensure patients are no
longer exposed to surprise medical bills. By
lowering costs, this bill would also improve
access to health care.’’
We also heard from Fredrick Isasi, Execu-
tive Director of Families USA, at our hear-
ing, who said:‘‘The Reducing Lower Health
Care Costs Act is an ambitious piece of legis-
lation—particularly so as a bipartisan bill in
these most contentious of times.’’
And Avik Roy recently wrote in Forbes:
‘‘Overall, its provisions could be thought of
as incremental in scope. But some—espe-
cially those around transparency—could
have a significant impact.’’
Here are a few of the ways this legislation
will lower health care costs:
Ensures that patients do not receive a sur-
prise medical bill—which is when you unex-
pectedly receive a $300 bill, or even a $3,000
bill, two months after our surgery, because
one of your doctors was outside of your in-
surance network.
Senators Cassidy, Hassan, and Murkowski
have done valuable work to solve surprise
medical billing by proposing a solution last
fall and again this spring, and lighting a fire
under Congress to end this harmful practice.
I thank them for their dedication to this
issue, and for working with Senator Murray
and me to reach a result that protects pa-
tients.
Senator Murray and I have agreed on a rec-
ommendation to our colleagues that the best
solution to protect patients from surprise
medical bills is to pay doctors and hospitals
that are out-of-network the median con-
tracted rate that in-network doctors and
hospitals receive for the same services in
their local geographic area, known as the
benchmark solution.
This is a change for me because I was in-
clined to support an in-network guarantee
since I believe it is the simplest solution.
Some of my colleagues are inclined to sup-
port a new independent system of dispute
resolution, known as arbitration. The Con-
gressional Budget Office has indicated that
the benchmark solution is the most effective
at lowering health care costs and Chairman
Pallone and Ranking Member Walden have
recommended this proposal to the House of
Representatives.
We have also extended this protection to
air ambulances, because according to the
Government Accountability Office, nearly 70
percent of air ambulance transports were
out-of-network in 2017 and the median price
charged by air ambulance providers was
about $36,400 for a helicopter transport and
$40,600 for a fixed-wing transport.
It is time to stop studying the issue of ex-
orbitant air ambulance charges and take ac-
tion.
Our legislation will treat air ambulances
the same as health care providers—by using
the local, commercial market-based rate for
in-network health care.
This legislation will bring more generic
and biosimilar drugs to market faster and
lower the cost of prescription drugs by: Help-
ing biosimilar companies speed drug develop-
ment through a transparent, modernized,
and searchable patent database. Senators
Collins, Kaine, Braun, Hawley, Murkowski,
Paul, Portman, Shaheen, and Stabenow
worked on this provision.
Improves the Food and Drug Administra-
tion’s drug patent database by keeping it
more up to date—to help generic drug com-
panies speed product development, a pro-
posal offered by Senators Cassidy and Dur-
bin.
Prevents the abuse of citizens’ petitions
that can unnecessarily delay drug approvals,
from Senators Gardner, Shaheen, Cassidy,
Bennet, Cramer, and Braun.
Clarifies that the makers of brand biologi-
cal products, such as insulin, are not gaming
the system to delay new, lower cost
biosimilars from coming to market, from
Senators Smith, Cassidy, and Cramer; and
Eliminates a loophole that allows drug com-
panies to get exclusivity—and delay less
costly alternatives from coming to market—
just by making small tweaks to an old drug,
a proposal from Senators Roberts, Cassidy,
and Smith.
Modernizes outdated labeling of certain ge-
neric drugs, offered by Senators Bennet and
Enzi.
This legislation creates more transparency
by:
Banning gag clauses that prevent employ-
ers and patients from knowing the true price
and quality of health care services. This pro-
posal from Senators Cassidy and Bennet
would allow an employer to know that a
knee replacement might cost $15,000 in one
hospital and $35,000 at another hospital;
Requiring health care facilities to provide
a summary of services when a patient is dis-
charged from a hospital to make it easier to
track bills, and requires hospitals to send all
bills within 45 calendar days to protect pa-
tients from receiving unexpected bills many
months after care, a provision worked on by
Senators Enzi and Casey; and
Requiring doctors and insurers to provide
patients with price quotes on their expected
out-of-pocket costs for care, so patients are
able to shop around, a proposal from Sen-
ators Cassidy, Young, Murkowski, Ernst,
Kennedy, Sullivan, Cramer, Braun, Hassan,
Carper, Bennet, Brown, Cardin, Casey,
Whitehouse, and Rosen.
It will support state and local efforts to in-
crease vaccination rates, and will help pre-
vent disease outbreaks, through two pro-
posals worked on by Senators Roberts,
Peters, and Duckworth.
There is a provision to help communities
prevent and reduce obesity, offered by Sen-
ators Scott and Jones.
A provision from Senators Schatz, Capito,
Cassidy, Collins, Heinrich, Hyde-Smith,
Kaine, King, Murkowski, and Udall will ex-
pand the use of technology-based health care
models to help patients in rural and under-
served areas access specialized health care.
And there is a proposal to improve access
to mental health care led by Senators Cas-
sidy and Murphy, building on their work in
the HELP Committee that became law as
part of the response to the opioid crisis.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4624 June 27, 2019
There are other proposals:
For example, banning anti-competitive
terms in health insurance contracts that
prevent patients from seeing other, lower-
cost, higher-quality providers. The Wall
Street Journal identified dozens of cases
where anti-competitive terms in contracts
between health insurers and hospital sys-
tems increase premiums and reduce patient
choice.
Banning Pharmacy Benefit Managers, or
PBMs, from charging employers, health in-
surance plans, and patients more for a drug
than the PBM paid to acquire the drug,
which is known as ‘‘spread pricing.’’
Eliminating a loophole allowing the first
generic drug to submit an application to the
FDA and block other generic drugs from
being approved.
Provisions to improve care for expectant
and new moms and their babies.
Provisions to make it as easy to get your
personal medical records as it is to book an
airplane flight.
And provisions to incentivize health care
organizations to use the best cybersecurity
practices to protect your privacy and health
information.
I hope we will today vote to approve this
legislative package so we can present it to
Majority Leader McConnell and Minority
Leader Schumer for the full Senate to con-
sider next month and would expect that
other committees will have their own con-
tributions.
Since January, Senator Murray and I have
been working in parallel with Senator Grass-
ley and Senator Wyden, who lead the Fi-
nance Committee.
They are working on their own bipartisan
bill, which they plan to markup this sum-
mer. The Senate Judiciary Committee is
marking up bipartisan legislation on pre-
scription drug costs tomorrow. And in the
House, the Energy and Commerce, Ways and
Means, and Judiciary Committees have all
reported out bipartisan bills to lower the
cost of prescription drugs.
Secretary Azar and the Department of
Health and Human Services have been ex-
tremely helpful in reviewing and providing
technical advice on the various proposals to
reduce health care costs.
And the president has called for ending
surprise billing and reducing the cost of pre-
scription drugs. The Administration has also
taken steps to increase transparency so fam-
ilies and employers can better understand
their health care costs. The Lower Health
Care Costs Act is just one example of this
Committee reaching a result on a difficult
issue.
We did that with fixing No Child Left Be-
hind, with the 21st Century Cures Act, with
user fee funding for the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, and most recently, with our re-
sponse to the opioid crisis that included
input from 72 senators of both political par-
ties.
We reached those results in the midst of
the argument Congress has been locked in
for the last decade about where six percent
of Americans get their health insurance.
Especially for Americans without sub-
sidies, the cost of health insurance remains
way too expensive. But the reality is we will
never have lower cost health insurance until
we have lower cost health care.
That is why I am especially glad that 65
Senators, including nearly every member of
this Committee, have worked together on
the Lower Health Care Costs Act which
takes needed steps to actually bring down
the cost of health care that Americans pay
for out of their own pockets.
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO TRENT CLARK
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, along
with my colleagues Senator JAMES
RISCH, Representative MIKE SIMPSON,
and Representative RUSS FULCHER, I
congratulate Trent Clark on his up-
coming retirement from the Bayer Cor-
poration after 26 years of service. We
have greatly enjoyed working with
Trent over the course of his career and
thank him for the service he has pro-
vided to the people of Idaho in both his
official and individual capacities.
On behalf of Bayer, Trent has pro-
vided steadfast dedication to his re-
sponsibilities inherent as public and
government affairs director. In that
role, he has provided invaluable assist-
ance to Bayer’s operations in Soda
Springs, which are an integral part of
the southeastern Idaho economy. Most
notably, Trent has played a critical
role in the effort to permit Bayer’s
next phosphate mine, Caldwell Canyon,
which has 40 years of estimated re-
serves and will be one of the world’s
most environmentally sustainable min-
ing operations, particularly in its ap-
proach to sage grouse habitat. Trent
has also helped to further important
company efforts to support our local
communities, particularly their school
systems, and to protect our environ-
ment. Additionally, for many years,
Trent has worked in a collaborative
manner with key stakeholders with a
genuine humility and desire to achieve
a positive outcome.
As an individual citizen, Trent has
also provided excellent service to the
people of Idaho in his capacity as
chairman of the Idaho Workforce De-
velopment Council and as a member of
the boards of the Idaho Humanities
Council, Idaho Community Founda-
tion, and the Idaho Association of
Commerce and Industry. Trent’s prior
public service includes 2 years as the
State executive director of the Farm
Services Administration, 3 years as
chairman of the Idaho Republican
Party, a year as staff to the Joint Eco-
nomic Committee of Congress, and 8
years as staff to former U.S. Senator
Steve D. Symms.
Prior to joining Bayer, Trent grad-
uated with honors from Brigham
Young University, where he majored in
political science and botany. He also
earned an associate of arts degree from
Ricks College in Rexburg, ID. After
college, Trent worked as a botany in-
structor for the Yellowstone Institute,
as well an executive vice president for
the Fox Creek Pack Station.
In addition to Trent’s strong record
of leadership and service to the com-
munity, Trent has served his family
and church well. Trent has been mar-
ried to the former Rebecca Lee since
May 23, 1986, and together, they have
four children: Brittany (deceased),
Kathleen, Christin, and Alexander.
Trent and his family enjoy horseback
riding and backcountry hiking and
camping. It is our sincere wish that
Trent be blessed with many years of re-
tirement with his family.∑

TRIBUTE TO TROY WITT
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this
week I have the distinct honor of rec-
ognizing Troy Witt, of Garfield County,
for his selfless actions in helping those
in need.
Troy, a rancher and commercial
trucker of Sand Springs, spearheaded
an effort to send much needed dona-
tions to farmers and ranchers impacted
by record flooding in Columbus, NE, in
March of 2019. He was inspired by Mon-
tanans who came to his aid following
the Lodgepole Complex fire, Montana’s
largest fire of the 2017 wildfire season.
After losing 85 percent of his ranch,
Witt was overwhelmed by the out-
pouring of support and supplies he re-
ceived from those he had never met.
When the opportunity presented
itself, Witt decided to pay it forward.
He planned to load up his 53–foot trail-
er with as much hay, fencing material,
water and other supplies as he could
and drive the 700 miles to the drop-off
site in Columbus. After the Garfield
County Disaster and Emergency Serv-
ices echoed Witt’s plans, farmers from
around Montana offered to donate sup-
plies. His efforts helped bring hope to a
region where hundreds had lost homes
and businesses.
Witt’s act exemplifies the spirit of
compassion and selflessness that Mon-
tanans embody. I and many others
thank Mr. Witt for his good deed.∑

TRIBUTE TO CLYDE TERRY
∑ Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today
I wish to salute Clyde Terry for his
many years of dedicated service and
staunch advocacy on behalf of people
with disabilities. Clyde is retiring from
his longtime role as CEO of Granite
State Independent Living, and he
leaves a legacy worthy of our praise
and our gratitude.
Granite State Independent Living—
GSIL—is a nonprofit that breaks down
barriers for seniors and people with dis-
abilities and expands the training and
support services available to them. Its
mission is grounded in a firm belief
that all people have a right to define
their own level of independence. Under
Clyde’s leadership, GSIL has blossomed
into an essential statewide organiza-
tion with a $17 million budget and sev-
eral awards and accolades to its name,
including Non-Profit of the Year
Awards from Business NH Magazine,
NH Business Review, and the Greater
Concord Chamber of Commerce. Serv-
ice offerings have grown as well to
meet the aging, education, and employ-
ment challenges faced by so many
across the Granite State.
Clyde has tapped into a wealth of ex-
perience to build GSIL into an expan-
sive and responsive organization that
remains committed to its founding
principles of personal choice and direc-
tion. Before his tenure at GSIL, he was

the executive director of the New
Hampshire Developmental Disabilities
Council, a State agency tasked with
protecting the rights of our State’s
most vulnerable citizens. While affili-
ated with the council, he coauthored a
report on the accessibility of polling
locations in the United States and es-
tablished himself as a national expert
on election reform. He was also an ad-
ministrative hearings officer in the
State’s service systems, and before
that, he helped to create and imple-
ment New Hampshire’s Low Income
Home Energy Assistance Program.
Throughout his career, Clyde has
shown an unrivaled passion for improv-
ing the lives of the disabled, the aged,
and the impoverished.
I was honored to recommend Clyde
when a vacancy arose on the National
Council on Disability in 2009. As a
member of the council, he became a
sought-after voice on the potential of
autonomous vehicles to broaden a
sense of independence among people
with disabilities. He was also a force in
fighting for fair pay and equal treat-
ment in the workplace. Clyde was even-
tually named chairperson of the coun-
cil, a testament to his leadership and
communication skills and his fluency
on the broad set of issues in the dis-
ability community.
I have known Clyde for decades. We
worked together on Gary Hart’s 1984
Presidential race. Though the cam-
paign eventually ended in heartbreak,
Clyde emerged from the race having
met Susan, who would become his be-
loved wife of many years. As Governor
of New Hampshire and U.S. Senator, I
always appreciated Clyde’s guidance
and counsel.
On behalf of the people of New Hamp-
shire, I ask my colleagues and all
Americans to join me in thanking
Clyde Terry for his years of service and
advocacy and wishing him all the best
in the years ahead.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and
were referred or ordered to lie on the
table as indicated:
POM–97. A joint resolution adopted by the
Legislature of the State of Montana urging
the United States Congress to pass a federal
country-of-origin labeling (COOL) law for
beef and pork products that meets World
Trade Organization requirements; to the
Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and
Forestry.
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 16
Whereas, in 2002, Congress reauthorized the
Farm Bill, which included mandatory coun-
try-of-origin labeling for beef, lamb, pork,
farm-raised and wild fish, peanuts, and other
perishable commodities; and
Whereas, in 2005, the Montana Legislature
passed the Country of Origin Placarding Act
until ‘‘funding and full implementation of
federal mandatory country of origin label-
ing’’; and
Whereas, in 2009, Montana’s country-of-ori-
gin labeling (COOL) laws were voided, as the
federal act was implemented; and
Whereas, in 2015, federal COOL rules ceased
being enforced for beef and pork products
only due mainly to a World Trade Organiza-
tion ruling; and
Whereas, consumers want to know the ori-
gin of their food; and
Whereas, American and Montana farmers
and ranchers want consumers to know the
origin of their food; and
Whereas, Congress should pass laws and
the U.S. Department of Agriculture should
administer rules and regulations for COOL
certification for beef and pork products that
do not impose undue compliance costs, li-
ability, recordkeeping, or verification re-
quirements on farmers and ranchers.
Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives of the
State of Montana:
That the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives of the 66th Montana Legislature
urges Congress to pass a federal COOL law

for beef and pork products that meets World
Trade Organization requirements; and be it
further
Resolved, That the Secretary of State send
copies of this resolution to the individual
members of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives and the United States Senate.
POM–98. A joint resolution adopted by the
Legislature of the State of Montana memori-
alizing its opposition to the bison grazing
proposal by the American Prairie Reserve; to
the Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources.
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 28
Whereas, the American Prairie Reserve
(APR) controls private properties tied to 18
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) grazing
allotments in Fergus, Petroleum, Phillips,
and Valley counties; and
Whereas, the APR has requested that the
SLM fundamentally shift long-established
grazing practices on the 18 BLM allotments,
which encompass 250,000 acres of public prop-
erty; and
Whereas, APR has petitioned to change the
allotments from seasonal or rotational graz-
ing to year-round grazing and remove the in-
terior fencing on those allotments; and
Whereas, the APR proposes to allow the
year-round, continuous grazing of public
land by bison, which would impact the future
grazing viability of the allotments; and
Whereas, the existing BLM designation for
managed grazing is what science dictates the
rangeland can support; and
Whereas, it is the responsibility of the
BLM to ensure the future vitality of these
public parcels is protected; and
Whereas, the removal of interior fences
will eliminate the ability of BLM to control
the access of bison to certain parcels to
shorten grazing permits in response to
drought or fire to protect the rangeland.
Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Senate
and the House of Representatives of the State of
Montana:
(1) That it is essential for the preservation
of the future viability of Montana’s range-
land that the BLM deny the petition by the
APR to alter grazing permits on the 18 allot-
ments under the control of APR.
(2) That the denial of the proposed APR
grazing permit change is critical for the
health of Montana’s livestock and wildlife.
(3) That private landowners and commu-
nities should not bear the cost of damages
incurred by the lack of integrated bison
management in the APR’s grazing proposal.
(4) That the denial of the APR grazing pro-
posal would protect Montana farmers, ranch-
ers, and communities.
(5) That the BLM should deny the APR
bison grazing proposal.
(6) That the Secretary of State send a copy
of this resolution to the United States Con-
gress, the Department of the Interior, and
the Bureau of Land Management.
POM–99. A joint resolution adopted by the
Legislature of the State of Montana memori-
alizing its support of the ratification of the
United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement; to
the Committee on Finance.
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 13
Whereas, the United States and Canada
have one of the largest trading relationships
in the world, and Canada is the United
States’ largest export market, valued at $320
billion ($411 billion Canadian) in goods and
services in 2017 and the United States is Can-
ada’s largest export market, valued at $308
billion ($396 billion Canadian) in 2017 goods
and services; and
Whereas, this trade supports 9 million jobs
in the United States and 2.1 million jobs in
Canada; and
Whereas, in the more than 20 years since
the United States, Canada, and Mexico en-
tered into the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA), trade among these
countries tripled from $340 billion in 1993 to
$1.2 trillion in 2016; and
Whereas, North American integration of
trade under NAFTA has helped to make the
region more competitive in the world econ-
omy by providing highly integrated and val-
uable supply chains, as well as common rules
and harmonized regulations that increase
the speed and global competitiveness of one
another’s businesses, and by driving invest-
ment and imbedding value in each others’
economic success, including by providing
jobs in North American communities; and
Whereas, Canada and Mexico are the first-
ranked and third-ranked markets, respec-
tively, for agriculture exports from the
United States at an estimated $20.6 billion
sent to Canada and $18.6 billion sent to Mex-
ico, up from $8.7 billion in 1992, the year that
NAFTA was signed; and
Whereas, of particular interest to Montana
because Canada is its largest trade partner,
Canada has agreed to grade imports of wheat
from the United States in a manner no less
favorable than that accorded to wheat in its
own country and not to require a country of
origin statement on its quality grade or in-
spection certificate; and
Whereas, in signing the United States-Mex-
ico-Canada Agreement, the three countries
have agreed to make targeted improvements
to NAFTA and build on the successful part-
nership and a shared competitiveness in the
global marketplace in which free, fair, open,
and mutually beneficial trade helps to
strengthen the economies of all countries.
1Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives of the
State of Montana:
That the Montana Legislature supports the
ratification of the United States-Mexico-
Canada Agreement on trade by all countries
as soon as possible; and be it further
Resolved, That the Montana Secretary of
State send copies of this resolution to the
President of the United States, the Speaker
of the United States House of Representa-
tives, the Majority Leader of the United
States Senate, the Consulate of Canada in
Colorado, the Consulate of Mexico in Colo-
rado, each member of the United States Sen-
ate Finance Committee, the United States
House of Representatives Ways and Means
Committee, the United States Senate Advi-
sory Group on Negotiations, and the United
States House of Representatives Advisory
Group on Negotiations, the United States
Trade Representative, the United States Sec-
retary of Commerce, the United States Sec-
retary of State, the United States Secretary
of Labor, the Director of the Office of Man-
agement and Budget, and the Intellectual
Property Enforcement Coordinator.

WYDEN):
S. 2008. A bill to prohibit, as an un-
fair or deceptive act or practice, com-
mercial sexual orientation conversion
therapy, and for other purposes; to the
Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation.
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, half a
century ago, members of the
LGBTQIA+ community, who were tired
of being accosted and abused and as-
saulted just because of who they were
or whom they loved, took a stand to
say ‘‘enough is enough’’ and pushed
back against the forces of history that
said they were anything less than.
Thanks to the sacrifice of freedom
fighters like Marsha P. Johnson, Syl-
via Rivera, and so many others both
named and unnamed who dared that
day to live their entire truth, countless
others today have been set free. Now,
50 years later, through dogged persist-
ence and sacrifice, we have been able to
pass laws and create policies that re-
spect and protect members of the
LGBTQIA+ community—from chal-
lenging hateful bans against lesbian
and gay relationships, to securing land-
mark civil rights protections against
hate crimes, to, finally, making mar-
riage equality the law of our land.
This year, as we commemorate the
50th anniversary of the Stonewall pro-
tests that sparked the modern move-
ment for LGBTQ equality, I am very
proud to stand here on the floor of the
Senate as an unapologetic ally for this
vibrant community.
As we close out this month’s annual
celebration of Pride, I come to the
floor today to reintroduce legislation
to further protect gay, lesbian, bisex-
ual, transgender, queer, intersex, asex-
ual, and gender nonconforming individ-
uals from the dogma of our Nation’s
homophobic and transphobic past be-
cause, even as we reflect on the
progress we have made, we have a lot
more to do to achieve equality.
In the Senate, I have been very proud
to stand shoulder to shoulder with the
community in Washington State and
around the country in order to con-
tinue our progress and work to expand
protections to help members of the
community thrive, from our efforts to
reduce bullying and harassment at col-
leges and universities through legisla-
tion named after Tyler Clementi—a
student who tragically died by suicide
in college—to reducing the epidemic of
harassment and discrimination in
workplaces through the Be HEARD
Act, which is a bill I recently intro-
duced that would hold businesses ac-
countable for harassment and discrimi-
nation, give workers the resources and
support they need to seek justice, and
clarify that discriminating on the basis
of sexual orientation and gender iden-
tity are unlawful under the Civil
Rights Act.
I am very grateful to my colleague
Senator BOOKER and our friend Rep-
resentative LIEU for joining me today
in reintroducing the Therapeutic Fraud
Prevention Act—the first Federal ban
on so-called conversion therapy—be-
cause, in 2019, we know that being a
member of the LGBTQIA+ community
isn’t an affliction, a disease, or some
chronic condition that requires med-
ical treatment; rather, the politicians
who say it is are on the wrong side of
history.
In fact, we know that conversion
therapy is a painful and discriminatory
practice. The American Psychological
Association has said it ‘‘is unlikely to
be successful in changing someone’s
sexual orientation’’ and would ‘‘involve
some risk of harm’’ contrary to the
claims of practitioners and advocates.
It is also a practice that is especially
harmful to LGBTQIA+ children, who
we already know are vulnerable to in-
creased harassment and discrimination
because of who they are.
I am proud that my home State of
Washington has already banned conver-
sion therapy, but that is not enough so
long as any child or any person in our
country can be harmed by this sham
practice. That is why I am very proud
to be here to reintroduce the Thera-
peutic Fraud Prevention Act and to re-
mind all of our friends that we stand
with them throughout history and
throughout the future to make sure
they are protected with their rights.
The Therapeutic Fraud Prevention
Act is legislation that would classify
conversion therapy as the fraudulent
practice our communities and science
know it is. It would clarify in our Na-
tion’s laws that providing or facili-
tating commercial conversion therapy
or facilitating or advertising such serv-
ices is an unfair and deceptive practice,
and it would ensure that Federal regu-
lators and State attorneys general
have the ability and authority to en-
force this ban.
We have come far in our long battle
for LGBTQIA+ equality, and I am
ready to get to work to get this impor-
tant legislation over the finish line be-
cause, after 50 years of struggle, as a
nation, we have come to know that
love is love and that love wins. How-
ever, after 50 years, we also know it
gets better but only if we work to
make it so.
From the horrors of the Pulse mas-
sacre, to the ever-climbing number of
murdered African-American and Latinx
transgender women, to President
Trump’s transgender military ban and
his administration’s continuous as-
sault on LGBTQIA+ rights, so many of
the challenges that face the commu-
nity today mirror the critical struggles
they faced all those years ago at the
Stonewall Inn. Like then, too many in
the community are still threatened by
even greater danger because they are
also women, transgender, people of
color, poor, and the list goes on.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4632 June 27, 2019
That is why this legislation and rec-
ognitions like Pride Month are so im-
portant. All month, I have been
thrilled to see the photos from Pride
celebrations back in Washington
State—from Spokane, to Yakima, to
Olympia—filled with so much cheer, re-
silience, and strength, only to come
back here to Washington and argue in
this Chamber about why we shouldn’t
confirm people to judicial or executive
posts who don’t believe in the full hu-
manity and equality of so many of our
family members, friends, neighbors,
and coworkers.
It is obvious that this work is still
very important, and we have it cut out
for us, but I remain hopeful because I
have seen how far we have come in just
50 years. By continuing to honor the
righteous tradition of Marsha, Sylvia,
and so many others by raising our
voices against injustice and taking key
steps like this legislation to make life
easier for the next generation of
LGBTQIA+ Americans, I know we will
see even more progress in the next 50
years.
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and
Mr. JONES):
S. 2018. A bill to provide Federal
matching funding for State-level
broadband programs; to the Committee
on Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise
today to introduce the American
Broadband Buildout Act of 2019, or
ABBA. This legislation would help en-
sure that rural Americans have access
to broadband services at speeds they
need to fully participate in the benefits
of our modern society and economy re-
gardless of whether they live in the
largest cities or the smallest towns. I
am delighted to be joined by my friend
and colleague Senator DOUG JONES in
introducing this bill.
Twenty-five years ago, when the
internet was known as the World Wide
Web, Americans typically accessed the
web using their home phone lines via
modems capable of downloading data
at just 56 kilobits per second—too slow
even to support MP3-quality streaming
music. Today, the threshold for
broadband service as defined by the
FCC allows downloads at speeds nearly
500 times faster—25 megabits per sec-
ond. At these speeds, Americans not
only can watch their favorite movies
on demand in the comfort of their very
own living rooms but can also partici-
pate in the global economy while work-
ing from home, upgrade their skills
through online education, stay con-
nected to their families as they age in
place, and access healthcare through
advances in telemedicine.
While the increase in broadband
speeds has been dramatic and is en-
couraging, these numbers mask a dis-
parity between urban and rural Ameri-
cans. Nearly all Americans living in
urban areas have access to the internet
at speeds that meet the FCC’s
broadband threshold, while one in four
rural Americans does not.
Similar disparities occur in terms of
broadband adoption—the rate at which
Americans subscribe to broadband
service if they have access to it. Ac-
cording to the Pew Research Center
survey last year, 22 percent of rural
Americans don’t use the internet at
home, compared to just 8 percent of
urban Americans.
The bipartisan bill that we are intro-
ducing would help close the digital di-
vide between urban and rural America
by directing the FCC to provide up to
$5 billion in matching grants to assist
States and State-approved entities in
building ‘‘last-mile’’ infrastructure to
bring high-speed broadband directly to
homes and businesses in areas that
lack it. Let me briefly discuss a few
key points about the bill that I would
like to highlight.
First, projects that receive funding
must be located in unserved areas
where broadband is unavailable at
speeds that meet the FCC standards.
Narrowing the focus to those areas will
ensure that the money goes where it is
needed most and will also protect
against overbuilding where broadband
infrastructure is already in place.
Second—and this is important—the
bill requires that this Federal funding
be matched through public-private
partnerships between the broadband
service provider and the State in which
the last-mile infrastructure project
will be built. This means that States
and their private sector partners will
have ‘‘skin in the game’’ to balance the
Federal commitment, ensuring that
projects will be well thought out and
designed to be sustainable.
Third, the bill requires that projects
be designed to be ‘‘future proof,’’ mean-
ing that the infrastructure installed
must be capable of delivering higher
speeds as broadband accelerates in the
future. This will ensure that Federal
tax dollars are used to help build a net-
work that serves rural Americans now
and in the future without our having to
rebuild it every time technology ad-
vances.
Furthermore, the bill directs the FCC
to prioritize the funding of projects in
States that have traditionally lagged
behind the national average in terms of
broadband subscribers and are at risk
of falling further behind as broadband
speeds increase.
Finally, the bill provides grants for
states and state-designated entities for
digital literacy and public awareness
campaigns, highlighting the benefits
and possibilities of broadband service
and helping to attract employers to
rural parts of our country in which
broadband services are lacking and yet
are essential for a business’s success.
The key reason to do this is to address
the disparity in the adoption rates I
have already mentioned, which will
help drive down the costs of the service
and make it more affordable for every-
one.
One broadband application that holds
special promise for rural America is
telemedicine. As a native of Aroostook
County—the largest county by land
area east of the Mississippi, with fewer
than 70,000 residents—I know how im-
portant healthcare is to the vitality
and even to the survival of rural com-
munities. Often, these communities
struggle to attract and retain the phy-
sicians they need to ensure their hav-
ing access to quality care for their citi-
zens. Broadband can help to bridge this
gap by enabling innovative healthcare
delivery in these rural communities.
In an example described to me in a
recent letter, hospice workers at
Northern Light Home Care and Hospice
were able to use the internet and video
technology to help support a patient
who was living on an island off the
coast of Maine—not as far as the
seagull flies but hours away in travel
time. Although the connection was
very poor, the video enabled the hos-
pice nurses to monitor the patient’s
symptoms and provide emotional sup-
port to her family. As the author of
that letter, Lisa Harvey-McPherson,
put it, ‘‘Our hospice team could be
doing so much more with video and
telemonitoring technologies if Maine
had better connectivity.’’
I ask unanimous consent that imme-
diately following my remarks, this let-
ter from Lisa Harvey-McPherson be
printed in the RECORD.
Mr. President, in closing, rural
Americans deserve to enjoy the bene-
fits of high-speed internet in the same
way that urban Americans do, but a
digital divide has arisen due to the
simple fact that rural areas are more
sparsely populated than urban ones and
are therefore more expensive to serve.
The bill that Senator JONES and I are
introducing today would help to bridge
this digital divide by funding future-
proof broadband where it is needed
most and giving a real boost to job cre-
ation in rural America.
I urge my colleagues to support our
bill.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
NORTHERN LIGHT HEALTH,
Brewer, ME, May 13, 2019.
Senator SUSAN COLLINS,
Dirksen Senate Office Building,
Washington, DC.
DEAR SENATOR COLLINS: On behalf of
Northern Light Health member organiza-
tions and the patients we serve, I want to
thank you for your support for the need to
advance health care technology in Maine.
Technology is an essential strategy to in-
crease access to health care services in rural
Maine. Northern Light Health is a tech-
nology leader in Maine providing a variety of
telehealth services including cardiology,
stroke, psychiatry, trauma, pediatric inten-
sive care and in-home telemonitoring serv-
ices state wide. As we work to expand oppor-
tunities for patients to receive health care
services through technology we consistently
encounter the challenge of inadequate (or
absent) broad band capacity. Northern Light
Health member organizations compete na-
tionally to recruit specialists to Maine, tech-
nology is often the only option to expand ac-
cess to specialists in rural Maine.
The following Northern Light Health ex-
amples highlight technology opportunities

and the need to increase broadband speed
and capacity in rural Maine.
Our hospice program cared for a patient on
an island off Hancock County. Staff placed a
tablet at the patient’s home and one with
the hospice nurse. Because of the challenges
of Island travel, it took hours to get to the
home to manage and support the patient and
her family. While the broadband connection
was very poor we were able to help with
symptoms and emotional support using video
technology. Our hospice team could be doing
so much more with video and telemonitoring
technologies if Maine had better
connectivity.
At Northern Light AR Gould in Presque
Isle, they are a pilot site for the telehealth
virtual walk-in clinic. Those using the sys-
tem within the pilot are amazed at the ease
of access to a provider to ask those easy
questions that keep patients out of the ED.
If successful, in a broader roll-out, patients
in local communities will have access to
walk-in level care (colds, rashes, general
health questions) without leaving their home
via technology. This is important given the
average age of the population and the dif-
ficulty of traveling roads during the winter
months in Aroostook County. The barrier to
fully expanding the telehealth virtual clinic
is broadband capacity.
Broadband access is also a professional re-
cruitment tool, often provider spouses have
difficulty finding meaningful employment.
Addressing rural broadband capacity will
support remote work.
In Aroostook County we are also evalu-
ating telepsychiatry services for the regional
nursing homes. This will significantly in-
crease access to psychiatry services which is
in clinical demand. Connectivity is a
foundational component of offering this
service.
Our electronic health record has expanded
access to individualized health information
for our patients, connectivity is a barrier to
patients accessing this important resource in
rural Maine.
As we increase our electronic health record
capacity providers are reliant on this tech-
nology as much as they are reliant on clin-
ical tools like a stethoscope. In areas with
broadband capacity challenges the providers
spend time looking at buffering symbols on
their screens for long periods of time in the
day.
We appreciate the opportunity to share
these examples with you and your staff as
you explore Congressional solutions to
Maine’s broadband challenge.
Sincerely,
LISA HARVEY-MCPHERSON
RN, MBA, MPPM,
Vice President Govern-
ment Relations.
By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr.
PERDUE, Mr. BROWN, and Ms.
COLLINS):
S. 2026. A bill to amend the Richard
B. Russell National School Lunch Act
to reauthorize the farm to school pro-
gram, and for other purposes; to the
Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition,
and Forestry.
In 2010, Congress passed the Healthy
and Hunger-Free Kids Act, which reau-
thorized child nutrition programs and
made healthy meal choices a reality to
children nationwide. Far too many
children and adolescents in the United
States suffer from obesity, which puts
them at risk for developing chronic
health conditions later in life. One of
the best ways to help students make
healthy choices is to teach them about
their food and how it is grown. Making
that connection makes a difference.
That is why I championed the inclusion
of funding for a farm to school grant
program, which was included in the
Healthy and Hunger-Free Kids Act.
The program has had tremendous
success and interest nationwide, and
has awarded grants in all 50 states and
the District of Columbia to support
programs in more than 33,000 schools.
Building upon the success of this pro-
gram, I am glad to be joined today by
Senators PERDUE, BROWN, and COLLINS
in introducing the Farm to School Act
of 2019. In years past, I have cham-
pioned this important farm to school
legislative effort with one of my dear-
est friends, Thad Cochran, who sadly
passed away last month.
We all know that hungry children
cannot learn. Studies have shown that
healthy nutrition in a young person’s
diet is crucial to cognitive ability and
better health in the long run. Food in-
security and obesity rates are still too
high in this country, resulting in poor
health, and learning and behavioral dif-
ficulties at school. The school meal
program has made tremendous strides
in recent years to ensure not only that
children have access to meals through-
out the school day, but that those
meals are nutritious. The Farm to
School program has given children and
schools across the country the tools to
craft farm-fresh, healthy, and delicious
meals that students enjoy.
The Farm to School grant program
offers support to farmers and local
economies, while teaching kids about
nutritious foods and how they are
grown. The program has a strong edu-
cational component, making our school
cafeterias an extension of the class-
room, giving students an opportunity
to learn about nutrition, well-balanced
meals, and even how to grow the food
themselves.
In Vermont, I have seen first-hand
how farm to school efforts have better
connected children with the food in
their cafeteria. Students participate in
school gardens, sustainability projects,
and taste tests for new school menu
items. With the help of a USDA Farm
to School grant, the Burlington School
Food Project has created a partnership
with a local Vermont beef processor
and 100 percent of the beef served the
last school year was locally sourced,
and that will continue next year as
well. Organizations in Vermont such as
Vermont Food Education Every Day,
Shelburne Farms, and the Northeast
Organic Farming Association have
been able to expand their programs to
link more farms to the classroom
throughout Vermont.
Farm to school is equally crucial to
farmers and ranchers by opening an-
other market to them to sell their lo-
cally grown and locally harvested
goods. The program links the class-
room with the farm to engage students
in the importance of farming and con-
tributing to the local economy. Every
dollar spent on local food generates up
to an additional $2.16 in economic ac-
tivity.
This program is so popular among
school and farmers alike that demand
for grants far outpaces available fund-
ing. Since the program began in 2013,
USDA has received more than 1,900 ap-
plications, but has only been able to
fund 437 projects. The Farm to School
Act of 2019 would build upon the suc-
cess of the program and expand its
reach by increasing the funding for the
program to $15 million per year. The
bill also recognizes the importance of
growing the program to include
preschools, summer food service pro-
gram sites, and after-school programs.
Ensuring children have enough food
to eat is an issue that unites us all.
There is simply no excuse that in the
wealthiest, most powerful Nation on
Earth people go hungry. Small changes
in eating habits by children will result
in lifelong health benefits for genera-
tions to come. The Farm to School pro-
gram empowers children and their fam-
ilies to make healthy choices now and
in the future. As the Senate begins
considering reauthorizing the child nu-
trition bill this year, I look forward to
including these improvements in the
Farm to School program.
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself,
Mr. GRASSLEY, Mr. SCHATZ, Mr.
DURBIN, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, Mr.
TILLIS, Mr. KAINE, Ms. ERNST,
and Mr. CRAMER):
S. 2032. A bill to expand research on
the cannabidiol and marihuana; to the
Committee on the Judiciary.
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I
rise today to introduce the Cannabidiol
and Marijuana Research Expansion Act
with my colleagues.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that
marijuana and its derivatives, like
cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD,
may be helpful in treating serious med-
ical conditions. However, anecdotal
evidence alone cannot be the basis for
developing new medications. Rather,
medication development must be based
on science.
Unfortunately, marijuana research is
subject to burdensome regulations
which may unintentionally inhibit re-
search and medication development.
The Cannabidiol and Marijuana Re-
search Expansion Act will reduce these
barriers without sacrificing security or
enabling diversion. It will ensure that
marijuana-derived medications are de-
veloped using strong scientific evi-
dence, and provide a pathway for the
manufacture and distribution of FDA-
approved drugs that are based on this
research.
First, the bill streamlines the regu-
latory process for marijuana research.
Specifically, it requires the Drug En-
forcement Administration (DEA) to
quickly approve or deny applications
to research CBD or marijuana and es-
tablishes a process by which applicants
may submit supplemental information,
if necessary.

It also improves regulations dealing
with changes to approved quantities of
marijuana needed for research and ap-
proved research protocols. These im-
provements will eliminate lengthy
delays that researchers encounter
under current regulations.
Second, this legislation seeks to in-
crease medical research on CBD.
It does so by explicitly authorizing
medical and osteopathic schools, re-
search universities, practitioners and
pharmaceutical companies to produce
the marijuana they need for approved
medical research. This will ensure that
researchers have access to the material
they need to develop proven, effective
medicines. Once the FDA approves
these medications, pharmaceutical
companies are permitted to manufac-
ture and distribute them.
Third, the bill fosters increased com-
munication between doctors and pa-
tients.
Because it is a Schedule I drug, some
doctors are hesitant to talk to their
patients about the potential harms and
benefits of using marijuana, CBD, or
other marijuana derivatives as a treat-
ment, for fear that they will lose their
DEA registrations. Yet, if patients are
using marijuana or its derivatives
without their doctors’ knowledge, it
could impact the effectiveness of the
care they receive. That is why our bill
authorizes these discussions to occur.
Finally, because existing Federal re-
search is lacking, the bill directs the
Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
ices to expand and coordinate research
to determine the potential medical
benefits of CBD or other marijuana-de-
rived medications on serious medical
conditions.
I have heard from many parents who
have turned to CBD as a last resort to
treat their children who have intrac-
table epilepsy. Anecdotally, CBD has
produced positive results. I have heard
similar stories from people who use
marijuana to treat various other med-
ical conditions.
But a common concern echoed in
many of these conversations is that
there is a lack of understanding about
the proper delivery mechanism, dosing,
or potential interactions that CBD or
marijuana may have with other medi-
cations. Some also worry because these
products aren’t well regulated or fac-
tory sealed, and often are labeled in-
correctly.
Without additional research, our
ability to adequately address these
concerns is limited and uninformed.
The need for additional research,
along with the need to increase the
supply of CBD and marijuana for re-
search purposes, was highlighted in the
National Academy of Sciences report,
titled ‘‘The Health Effects of Cannabis
and Cannabinoids: The Current State
of Evidence and Recommendations for
Research.’’
I firmly believe that we should re-
duce the regulatory barriers associated
with researching marijuana and CBD.
If and when science shows that these
substances are effective in treating se-
rious medical illnesses, we should en-
able products to be brought to the mar-
ket with FDA approval. I hope my col-
leagues will join me in supporting this
important piece of legislation.
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the
floor.
By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and
Mr. VAN HOLLEN):
S. 2036. A bill to amend the Work-
force Innovation and Opportunity Act
to provide grants to States for summer
employment programs for youth; to
the Committee on Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions.
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I would
like to call the Senate’s attention to
the Youth Summer Jobs and Public
Service Act of 2019 that I am intro-
ducing today with my colleague from
Maryland, Senator VAN HOLLEN. This
legislation authorizes the Department
of Labor to award Summer Employ-
ment for Youth grants to connect
youth with jobs that serve their local
communities and private businesses
over the summer months.
Since the mid-1990s, my home city of
Baltimore has organized the Youth
Works program out of the Mayor’s Of-
fice of Employment Development. The
Youth Works program provides individ-
uals between the ages of 14 to 21 with a
summer job with employers ranging
from private businesses, local commu-
nity nonprofit organizations, to city
and State government agencies
throughout the City. At these summer
jobs, participants are provided with
meaningful work experiences, are able
to learn to develop the attitudes and
grit necessary to compete in the work-
force, gain exposure to a variety of ca-
reer fields, and have a safe, stable envi-
ronment over the summer months dur-
ing the day. For the 2019 Youth Works
session that begins next week, Balti-
more youth participating in the pro-
gram will have a job for five days a
week, five hours per day from July 1st
through August 2nd and be paid a min-
imum of $10.10 per hour for their serv-
ice.
This program has grown to be one of
the largest youth summer employment
programs in the Nation. After the un-
rest in my home city in April 2015, the
Federal Department of Labor provided
the Maryland Department of Labor, Li-
censing and Regulation and the Balti-
more City’s Mayor’s Office of Employ-
ment with a $5 million grant to develop
innovative job training strategies and
work opportunities for youth and
young adults across Baltimore. This
Federal grant increased the number of
individuals able to be served by the
Youth Works program from an historic
average of 5,000 participants to the
more than 8,000 served today. Last
year, Youth Works provided 8,600 Balti-
moreans with jobs at more than 900 dif-
ferent worksites across my home city.
I’m proud to say that some of those in-
dividuals who participated in the
Youth Works program over the course
of multiple summers while in high
school have recently graduated and
were hired by State agencies such as
the Maryland Department of Natural
Resources. Baltimore youth and their
families clearly see the value of this
program, with more than 14,000 individ-
uals applying for Youth Works slots
this upcoming summer.
Unfortunately, due to the lack of
funding between the partnership be-
tween the City, State, private business,
and philanthropic ventures, more than
5,000 Baltimore City youth who sought
summer employment will be denied the
opportunity to gain experience in the
workplace, foster confidence that they
are capable of being successful in a new
environment, and lose the security of a
safe environment over the summer. We
can and must do more to help individ-
uals willing and eager to start their ca-
reers.
The Youth Summer Jobs and Public
Service Act would seek to eliminate
the waiting list for Baltimore students
seeking to participate in Youth Works
or other summer employment pro-
grams around the Nation. If enacted,
my legislation would allow States to
compete for Summer Employment for
Youth grants to serve communities
like Baltimore that have high con-
centrations of eligible, low-income
youth. The grants would be utilized by
local communities to carry out pro-
grams like the Youth Works program
that provide summer employment op-
portunities that are directly linked to
academic and occupations learning by
providing meaningful work experi-
ences. States competing for grants
would be required to partner with pri-
vate businesses to the extent feasible
and to prioritize jobs and work oppor-
tunities that directly serve their com-
munities, such as through summer em-
ployment with local community non-
profit organizations and city and State
government agencies. This additional
Federal funding can boost existing pro-
grams such as Youth Works and allow
other communities across Maryland to
establish their own programs and de-
velop Maryland’s next generation of
workforce.
I am proud to lead this Senate effort
with my colleague from Maryland and
appreciate the work of Representative
CEDRIC RICHMOND of Louisiana who ini-
tially led this effort in the U.S. House
of Representatives and will shortly in-
troduce companion legislation this
Congress. I urge my Senate colleagues
to join with me in this effort to con-
nect youth with summer employment
opportunities and start their journey
towards fulfilling, successful careers.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the text of the bill be printed
in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD fol-
lowing my remarks.
There being no objections, so or-
dered.

World Trade Center in New York City, the
Pentagon in Virginia, and the Flight 93 crash
site near Shanksville, Pennsylvania;
Whereas the United States came together
to honor the loved ones who were victims of
the attack and the heroes of September 11th,
including the first responders, in the days,
weeks, and months after the attack by erect-
ing the National September 11 Memorial and
Museum, the Pentagon Memorial, and the
Flight 93 National Memorial;
Whereas, as a further tribute to first re-
sponders and the individuals who lost their
lives, the September 11th National Memorial
Trail Alliance, in partnership with State and
local governments and other nonprofit orga-
nizations, was formed to develop a 1,300-mile
trail and greenway to connect the 3 memo-
rials;
Whereas the September 11th National Me-
morial Trail is a biking, hiking, and driving
trail that provides a physical link between
the 3 memorials;
Whereas the September 11th National Me-
morial Trail passes through Virginia, Mary-
land, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jer-
sey, New York, Delaware, and the District of
Columbia;
Whereas the September 11th National Me-
morial Trail forms an unbroken triangle
that links the cities, towns, and commu-
nities along the trail that are home to State
and local memorials and other significant
sites that reflect the spirit of United States
patriotism and resilience;
Whereas the September 11th National Me-
morial Trail—
(1) starts at the Pentagon Memorial in Ar-
lington, Virginia;
(2) follows the Mt. Vernon Trail and then
extends north along the 184-mile Chesapeake
and Ohio Canal National Historical Park;
(3) connects at Cumberland, Maryland,
with the 150-mile Great Allegheny Passage,
which the Trail then follows to Garrett in
Somerset County, Pennsylvania;
(4) turns northeast and continues for ap-
proximately 21 miles to the Flight 93 Na-
tional Memorial;
(5) continues east through the commu-
nities and historic sights of Pennsylvania
until arriving at the 130-mile Liberty Water
Gap Trail in New Jersey, which the Trail
then follows to New York City;
(6) continues to the National September 11
Memorial and Museum in New York City;
(7) returns south, following important sec-
tions of the East Coast Greenway and con-
necting the 9/11 Memorial Garden of Reflec-
tion to the trail;
(8) continues along the National Mall in
Washington, D.C.; and
(9) ends at the Pentagon Memorial;
Whereas the September 11th National Me-
morial Trail serves as an important rec-
reational and transportation venue for pro-
moting tourism, economic development,
healthy bodies and minds, and cultural and
educational opportunities;
Whereas the September 11th National Me-
morial Trail has the support of States, local
communities, and the private sector;
Whereas recognition by the Senate of the
September 11th National Memorial Trail does
not confer any affiliation of the Trail with
the National Park Service or the National
Trails System;
Whereas recognition by the Senate of the
September 11th National Memorial Trail does
not authorize Federal funds to be expended
for any purpose related to the Trail; and
Whereas States, local communities, and
the private sector are encouraged to join to-
gether to complete the September 11th Na-
tional Memorial Trail: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the
September 11th National Memorial Trail as

SENATE THAT THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BAIL

Committee on Finance:
S. RES. 268
Whereas every State in the United States
is a sovereign entity with a constitution and
the authority to issue sovereign debt;
Whereas the legislature of every State in
the United States has the authority to re-
duce spending or raise taxes to pay the obli-
gations owed by the State;
Whereas officials in every State in the
United States have the legal obligation to
fully disclose the financial condition of the
State to investors who purchase the debt of
the State;
Whereas Congress has rejected prior re-
quests from creditors of a State for payment
of the defaulted debt of a State; and
Whereas, during the financial crisis in 1842,
the Senate requested that the Secretary of
the Treasury report to the Senate with re-
spect to any negotiations with any creditor
of a State relating to assuming or guaran-
teeing any debt of the State, to ensure that
promises of support by the Federal Govern-
ment were not proffered: Now, therefore, be
it
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate
that—
(1) the Federal Government should take no
action to redeem, assume, or guarantee any
debt, including pension obligations, of a
State; and
(2) the Secretary of the Treasury should re-
port to Congress any negotiations to engage
in actions that would result in an outlay of
Federal funds on behalf of creditors of a
State.

nical assistance for the investigation into
Alex Villamayor’s death and the United
States Embassy in Asunción, Paraguay has
offered such assistance to Paraguayan au-

Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I
rise to pay tribute to an exemplary
young Marylander whose life was trag-
ically cut short four years ago today.
Senator VAN HOLLEN and I have just in-
troduced a resolution which pays trib-
ute to Alex’s life, calls for justice and
accountability in his murder, and pro-
cedures to ensure other families do not
suffer this same tragedy.
Luis Alejandro ‘‘Alex’’ Villamayor
was born on July 3, 1998, to parents
Puning Luk Villamayor and Luis
Felipe Villamayor in Rockville, Mary-
land. Those who knew him remember
him as a smart, loving, and compas-
sionate young man with a good sense of
humor. Alex was committed to his par-
ents, siblings, and friends. He was a de-
voted member of his church and always
sought to help those less fortunate.
Alex Villamayor moved with his fam-
ily to Paraguay at the age of six. He
attended high school there and grad-
uated with honors from the Pan Amer-
ican International School and was ac-
cepted to attend Montgomery College
in Maryland in the fall of 2015 to study
business management. He ultimately
planned to pursue a career to help and
support the Paraguayan people, but
was tragically murdered on June 27,
2015, in the city of Encarnación.
Alex’s death was wrongfully ruled a
suicide by Paraguayan authorities,
who had not properly investigated the
death at that point and failed to col-
lect blood and DNA samples from indi-
viduals present at the scene of the
crime, conduct gunshot residue anal-
ysis, or collect cellular phone records
and data from individuals present at
the crime scene.
After Alex’s family noted gross in-
consistencies in accounts of his death,
Alex’s body was exhumed for additional
forensic examination, which found that
he had been raped and physically as-
saulted prior to his death. Finally, in
September 2015, Alex’s death was ruled
a homicide. René Hofstetter and Ma-
thias Wilbs were charged with crimes
in relation to Alex Villamayor’s mur-
der and Paraguayan authorities opened
a formal investigation of Alain Jacks
Dı́az de Bedoya, who was also present
at the time of Alex’s death. While the
charges against, Mr. Dı́az de Bedoya
were eventually dropped, in April 2018
René Hofstetter was convicted of homi-
cide and sentenced to 12 years in prison
and Mathias Wilbs was sentenced to
two years and 10 months on obstruc-
tion of justice.
In spite of these convictions, I re-
main concerned about the handling of
this case. In spite of an offer to assist,
the Government of Paraguay never al-
lowed the FBI to provide technical as-
sistance for the investigation. Our Am-
bassador at the time told media outlets
that ‘‘the investigation and the han-
dling of this case has been worrisome.’’
Of even greater concern, members of
Alex’s immediate family continue to
face grave physical threats in Para-
guay for their pursuit of justice.
Senators VAN HOLLEN and I continue
to offer our deepest condolences to the
Villamayor family and, through this
resolution, call on Paraguayan au-
thorities to finally allow the FBI to as-
sist in this case and provide the nec-
essary protections to Alex’s family. We
similarly ask the Department of State
to prioritize justice for Alex
Villamayor in its diplomatic engage-
ment with the Government of Para-
guay and to review its procedures for
providing services to the families of
United States citizens slain or as-
saulted abroad.
On this sad anniversary, we remain
committed to honoring the life of Alex
Villamayor and working to ensure this
tragic story does not repeat itself.

Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Ms. DUCKWORTH, Mr.
MERKLEY, Mr. CARDIN, Ms. HASSAN, and
Mrs. FEINSTEIN) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to:
S. RES. 270
Whereas the Stonewall Inn opened on or
around March 18, 1967, at 53 Christopher
Street in the Greenwich Village neighbor-
hood of New York City;
Whereas the neighborhood of Greenwich
Village, and establishments like the Stone-
wall Inn, served as a sanctuary for members
of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
and queer (referred to in this preamble as
‘‘LGBTQ’’) community from persecution by
police and society at large;
Whereas during the time around the open-
ing of the Stonewall Inn, many State and
local governments, including New York City,
criminalized how LGBTQ individuals express
their identities and relationships, which re-
sulted in LGBTQ individuals frequently
being harassed by law enforcement, includ-
ing the New York City Police Department
(referred to in this preamble as the
‘‘NYPD’’);
Whereas LGBTQ individuals had begun to
stand up to such police harassment, includ-
ing at Cooper Do-nuts in Los Angeles in 1959,
Compton’s Cafeteria in San Francisco in
1966, and Black Cat Tavern in Los Angeles in
1967;
Whereas, in the early morning hours of
June 28, 1969, the NYPD raided the Stonewall
Inn and arrested many patrons;
Whereas brave individuals, particularly
transgender women of color, stood up to in-
justice the night of June 28, 1969, which
sparked an uprising against the NYPD, with
confrontations and protests at the Stonewall
Inn and the surrounding area lasting until
July 3, 1969;
Whereas the Stonewall uprising empowered
thousands of LGBTQ individuals to emerge
from the shadows and come out publicly as
they stood up for their community the night
of June 28, 1969 and beyond, putting their
lives and safety at risk;
Whereas, along with public protests in Chi-
cago, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia,
San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and else-
where, the Stonewall uprising became a cat-
alyst for the LGBTQ civil rights movement
to secure social and political equality and
inspired the formation of many advocacy or-
ganizations;
Whereas, on June 27–28, 1970, members of
the LGBTQ community commemorated the
first anniversary of Stonewall and re-
affirmed the solidarity of the LGBTQ com-
munity by organizing the first Pride
marches, or gatherings, in New York City,
San Francisco, Chicago, and Los Angeles;
Whereas the Stonewall uprising is remem-
bered and celebrated every year in June dur-
ing ‘‘LGBTQ Pride Month’’;
Whereas in June 2016 the Stonewall Inn
and its surrounding area was declared a na-
tional monument, becoming the first na-
tional monument to commemorate the
LGBTQ civil rights movement;
Whereas WorldPride will be held in June
2019 for the first time in the United States in
New York City to commemorate the Stone-
wall uprising, bringing representatives of the
global LGBTQ community to recognize these
historic events;
Whereas on May 30, 2019, New York City
announced that it would dedicate a monu-
ment honoring pioneering transgender activ-
ists and key leaders in the Stonewall upris-
ing, Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera,
the first permanent public monument in the
world honoring transgender women;
Whereas on June 6, 2019, the NYPD offi-
cially apologized for the raid on the Stone-
wall Inn;
Whereas, despite the progress made since
the Stonewall uprising, members of the
LGBTQ community have experienced biased
policing and are still at significant risk of
violence and discrimination;
Whereas, according to the annual hate
crimes report published by the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation, LGBTQ individuals,
particularly LGBTQ individuals of color,
continue to be the target of bias-motivated
violence, and efforts to address this violence
may be hindered by a continued lack of trust
in law enforcement;
Whereas not less than 100 transgender indi-
viduals, primarily women of color, have been
murdered in the United States since the be-
ginning of 2015; and
Whereas no individual in the United States
should have to fear being the target of vio-
lence because of who they are or who they
love: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) recognizes the 50th Anniversary of the
Stonewall uprising;
(2) condemns violence and discrimination
against members of the LGBTQ community
and recommits itself to securing justice,

DAY’’ AND RECOGNIZING THAT
THE COLLECTION AND RESTORA-
TION OF HISTORIC AND CLASSIC
CARS IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF PRESERVING THE TECHNO-
LOGICAL ACHIEVEMENTS AND
CULTURAL HERITAGE OF THE
UNITED STATES
Mr. BURR (for himself and Mr.
TESTER) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was considered and
agreed to:
S. RES. 271
Whereas many people in the United States
maintain classic automobiles as a pastime
and do so with great passion and as a means
of individual expression;
Whereas the Senate recognizes the effect
that the more than 100-year history of the
automobile has had on the economic
progress of the United States and supports
wholeheartedly all activities involved in the
restoration and exhibition of classic auto-
mobiles;
Whereas the collection, restoration, and
preservation of automobiles is an activity
shared across generations and across all seg-
ments of society;
Whereas thousands of local car clubs and
related businesses have been instrumental in
preserving a historic part of the heritage of
the United States by encouraging the res-
toration and exhibition of such vintage
works of art;
Whereas automotive restoration provides
well-paying, high-skilled jobs for people in
all 50 States; and
Whereas automobiles have provided the in-
spiration for music, photography, cinema,
fashion, and other artistic pursuits that have
become part of the popular culture of the
United States: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) designates July 12, 2019, as ‘‘Collector
Car Appreciation Day’’;
(2) recognizes that the collection and res-
toration of historic and classic cars is an im-
portant part of preserving the technological
achievements and cultural heritage of the
United States; and
(3) encourages the people of the United
States to engage in events and commemora-
tions of Collector Car Appreciation Day that
create opportunities for collector car owners
to educate young people about the impor-
tance of preserving the cultural heritage of
the United States, including through the col-
lection and restoration of collector cars.

WITH IRAN BY THE HOUTHI
MOVEMENT AND ITS ALLIES IN
YEMEN
Mr. COTTON (for himself, Mrs.
BLACKBURN, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. BRAUN, Mr.
CORNYN, Mr. INHOFE, and Mr. CRUZ)
submitted the following concurrent
resolution; which was referred to the
Committee on Foreign Relations:
S. CON. RES. 21
Whereas, in 2014 and 2015, the Houthi move-
ment, also known as Ansar Allah, and its al-
lies attacked Yemen’s internationally recog-
nized government and seized control of the
capital, Sana’a, and the port city of Aden;
Whereas, since 2015, the Houthis have ex-
panded their armed campaign beyond Yem-
en’s borders to target civilian infrastructure
in Saudi Arabia and possibly beyond, includ-
ing hundreds of missile and drone attacks
against civilian targets in Saudi Arabia that
have killed innocent civilians;
Whereas the Houthi movement’s slogan is,
‘‘God is great! Death to America! Death to
Israel! Curse upon the Jews! Victory to
Islam!’’;
Whereas al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula
and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria—
Yemen Province have taken advantage of the
Yemeni civil war to expand their territory
and resources;
Whereas Iran and its proxies have provided
direct financial, material, and logistical sup-
port to the Houthis for at least a decade;
Whereas the United Nations Panel of Ex-
perts on Yemen has found that Iran is in vio-
lation of United Nations Security Council
Resolution 2216 (2015) for supplying the
Houthis with missiles and drones;
Whereas the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait between
Yemen, Djibouti, and Eritrea, which con-
nects the Suez Canal and Red Sea to the In-
dian Ocean, is a strategically important
transit point for a significant amount of
global trade each year;
Whereas the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait is the
world’s fourth-largest transit point for oil
shipments;
Whereas, in its January 2018 and January
2019 reports, the United Nations Panel of Ex-
perts on Yemen expressed concern that
Houthi missile attacks and sea mines re-
leased in the Red Sea and Bab-el-Mandeb
Strait threatened commercial shipping and
humanitarian aid;
Whereas, in October 2016, the Houthis
launched multiple cruise missiles at United
States Navy warships while they were in

Whereas according to Human Rights

tarian aid;
Whereas, on June 21, 2019, the World Food
Programme announced that it was partially
suspending aid to parts of Yemen controlled
by the Houthis because of interference with
food distribution and aid convoys and the
misappropriation of food by Houthi officials;
Whereas Reporters Without Borders esti-

Whereas according to the United Nations
monitoring mission in Hodeidah, the Houthis
had not removed many of their military in-
stallations and equipment from the port city
as of June 12, 2019; and
Whereas, on June 24, 2019, the United
States, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and
the United Arab Emirates released a joint
statement that raised concerns that Iranian
activities were destabilizing both Yemen and
the broader region, reaffirmed support for
the efforts of United Nations Special Envoy
Martin Griffiths, and called on all parties in
Yemen to accelerate implementation of the
Stockholm agreement: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That Congress—

gion of an Iranian foothold on the Arabian
Peninsula;
(3) urges the Houthis and other parties in
the Yemeni civil war to uphold the terms of
the December 2018 ceasefire and withdrawal
agreement agreed to in Stockholm, Sweden;
and
(4) urges the United States Government to
support a peace process to end the civil war
and humanitarian crisis in Yemen while pre-
venting Iran and terrorist groups, including
al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the
Islamic State of Iraq and Syria—Yemen
Province, from gaining a permanent foothold
on the Arabian Peninsula.

CONFIRMATION OF ROB WALLACE
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I
would like to say just a few words
about Rob Wallace, the newly con-
firmed Assistant Secretary for Fish,
Wildlife, and Parks at the Department
of Interior.
I have known Rob for over 35 years.
Without question, Rob is the right per-
son for the job. Throughout his long
and distinguished career, Rob has
struck the proper balance between
wildlife management, habitat manage-
ment, and the use of our public lands.
In terms of wildlife conservation,
Rob is way up there in terms of his
commitment. Rob’s experience and
leadership in Wyoming and in our Na-
tion’s capital are ideally suited for this
critically important position.
Throughout his 45-year career, Rob
has served in a variety of jobs that di-
rectly relate to the two Federal agen-
cies he has been nominated to oversee.
Rob began his career as a seasonal park
ranger in Grand Teton National Park.
Since then, Rob has served in a number
of positions. He has been Assistant Di-
rector of the National Park Service,
chief of staff for Wyoming Senator
Malcolm Wallop, staff director for the
U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Re-
source Committee—a committee on
which I currently sit. He has been chief
of staff for Wyoming Governor Jim
Geringer, and manager of U.S. Govern-
ment Relations for the General Elec-
tric Company.
Rob currently serves as the president
of the Upper Green River Conservancy.
It is the Nation’s first cooperative con-
servation bank. Rob cofounded the
Upper Green River Conservancy. It pro-
tects core sage grouse habitat in the
ecologically rich and the energy rich
Upper Green River watershed in South-
west Wyoming.
He built an innovative partnership of
ranchers, conservation groups, energy
companies, investors, and other stake-
holders. Rob is also the founding mem-
ber of the board of the Grand Teton Na-
tional Park Foundation, a group of
people absolutely working together,
committed to the Grand Teton Na-
tional Park. It promotes the park’s
cultural, historic, and natural re-
sources. He has also served on the
boards of many organizations dedicated
to conserving wildlife and enhancing
our national parks.
Rob’s nomination passed the Envi-
ronment and Public Works Committee
by unanimous vote, and a near-unani-
mous reported vote in the Committee
of Energy and Natural Resources.
Rob Wallace is an outstanding choice
for this position of Assistant Secretary
for Fish, Wildlife and Parks. He is the
right person for the job, and I am so
pleased the Senate has now confirmed
his nomination.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida.

SIGNING AUTHORITY
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the majority
leader, the senior Senator from South
Carolina, the junior Senator from
Oklahoma, and the junior Senator from
North Carolina be authorized to sign

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

f
IRAN
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I am
going to try to do this in about 12 min-
utes, since I am not sure how many
people are left to speak tonight and I
know the staff worked hard and we will
be up early tomorrow voting on the
pending Udall amendment. That is
what I want to talk about.
I have watched all week the debate
on some of these topics. I think it is a
really good debate, actually. In some
ways, I am very pleased the amend-
ment has been offered because it has
given us an opportunity to talk about a
topic I don’t think we have talked
enough about; that is, foreign policy,
the security threats before our coun-
try, and, in particular, what the role of
Congress is in all of this.
There are a couple of things I want to
say at the outset. Here is the first. A
lot of people who cover this stuff in the
news like very simplistic terms. It
makes it easier to write the articles
and makes it easier to describe the cir-
cumstances. The terms people like to
use are ‘‘hawk,’’ or ‘‘dove,’’ or ‘‘war-
like.’’ I am not in favor of war. I have
actually never advocated for a military
attack on Iran, in these circumstances
especially. There are a lot of reasons
for it, but it will take me more than 15
minutes to explain it all. Suffice it to
say, it is certainly not the first or the
second.
The policy of the United States in
Iran today is the one I support; that is,
crippling economic sanctions that deny
them the money to do the bad things
they do but also a forced posture that
we are prepared with enough people
there in the military, so if they do at-
tack us, we can defend ourselves.
I want to say at the outset that I am
not here today to speak in favor of war
or to call for war but to speak about
reality and the situation as we face it
today.
The second thing I want to point to is
there is this notion out there that
there is some clear-cut constitutional
limitation on the President when it
comes to the use of force in virtually
every circumstance and that somehow
the current President is being enabled
by the Members of his party here to do
whatever he wants. That is just not
true. I will explain why in a moment.
I want to begin with why we are even
here. It is one of the topics that has
been touched on this week, which I
think deserves a direct response. I
heard a number of Senators who came
to the floor. I watched the debate last
night, and there will be another one to-
night within the Democratic Party.
You almost get a sense that what they
are arguing is that Iran was under con-
trol and wasn’t doing anything wrong
until Donald Trump came along and
pulled us out of the Iran deal. That is
just not true. That is patently false.
The only thing Iran wasn’t doing is
enriching uranium beyond a certain
threshold. That is not necessarily a bad
thing that they weren’t doing it, but
that is the only thing that deal cov-
ered.
Here is what Iran was still doing.
Iran was still sponsors terrorism. You
ask, why is it that they sponsor ter-
rorism? Iran wants to be the dominant
power in the Middle East, and one of
the ways they seek to achieve it is to
find all of these groups—Hezbollah,
Shia militias in Iraq and Syria, the
Houthis in Yemen—and empower those
groups.
They have an organization called the
IRGC, which is the real military and
the real power in Iran. Underneath the
IRGC, there is an organization called
the Quds Force, which is their covert
operations unit led by a guy named
General Soleimani. He goes around the
entire region sponsoring these groups—
training them and providing weapons.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4646 June 27, 2019
Here is what they hope to do. If they
ever get into a conflict, they will use
these groups to attack people. Why do
they use those groups? No. 1, because
Iran doesn’t have the ability to station
troops all over the region. No. 2, it
gives them deniability. They can say:
We didn’t attack you. It was the
Houthis or Shia militia. It allows them
some level of deniability while still in-
flicting pain.
If you want to know what else Iran
has done using that strategy, it has
maimed or killed hundreds of Amer-
ican service men and women in Iraq.
They didn’t buy all those IEDs that
were blowing up on Amazon; they
didn’t order them on eBay. They were
built and supplied by the Iranians.
That is who did it. There is no dispute
about that.
President Obama signed this Iran
deal. Iran began to get more money
into their treasury because they could
now engage in certain economic activ-
ity. What did Iran do with that money?
Let me tell you what they didn’t do.
They didn’t build schools, roads, and
bridges. They didn’t reinvest it in their
economy or their education system.
Iran took the money they were making
from the Iran deal. The Iran deal now
allows them to engage in commerce
that they weren’t allowed to. They
took that extra money, and they used
it to sponsor terrorism—to sponsor
Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Today Hezbollah not only has more
missiles than they had 10 or 15 years
ago, but their missiles are better than
they were. They could now, theoreti-
cally, overwhelm Israel’s defenses with
barrages of attacks. They have guid-
ance systems on those missiles now. In
fact, they have gotten so much assist-
ance from Iran, they don’t even need to
ship these missiles to them anymore.
They can make them themselves.
What about the Houthis? The
Houthis are a group that already ex-
isted, but they were only able to make
the gains they made in Yemen with
Iranian support. You read in the news
every day about these missiles and
drones used by the Houthis to attack
Saudi Arabia. It doesn’t get a lot of
coverage, but where do you think they
bought these things from? Do you
think they made them? We didn’t sell
them to them. Those are Iranian mis-
siles. All of it is provided by this addi-
tional money they got their hands on.
They also conduct cyber attacks.
Here is the most dangerous part of
the Iran deal. Yes, it dealt with ura-
nium enrichment and supervision, but
it did nothing with the missile system.
To have a nuclear threat, you have to
do three things; No. 1, have a bomb de-
signed, which is the easiest part, be-
lieve it or not; No. 2, have the indus-
trial capacity to enrich uranium to
weapons grade, and that is just a func-
tion of time and willingness. Once you
can enrich at any level, you can keep
going. That is what the deal dealt with;
and the third thing you have to do is
deliver it. You have to launch it on
something to reach your target.
The deal with Iran did nothing on the
missiles. It gave them more money,
and they used some of that money to
build missiles that now have longer
ranges. Where Iran, 5 or 10 years ago,
had a more limited range of places to
strike, today Iran can strike virtually
every capital in the Middle East and
every base in the region. That is where
they were putting this money.
The Trump administration came in
and said: Let me get this straight. We
did a deal with Iran. They get a lot
more money. They use that money to
build better missiles, to sponsor ter-
rorism, to conduct cyber attacks, and
the only thing is they can’t enrich ura-
nium for a period of time until the deal
goes away? That is not a bad deal for
Iran because what they were banking
on is that in 10 years, we would be fo-
cused on something else. The world
would forget, and all of a sudden they
would be able to enrich.
The deal was a fraud. It did nothing
to make Iran less dangerous. The only
thing the deal did is slow down their
enrichment capability, but at no time
are they less than 11⁄2 to 2 years away
to breaking out to weapons grade. At
some point, they would—at least they
retain that very option.
This idea that somehow Iran wasn’t
doing anything wrong but pulling out
of the deal caused all these tensions is
just not true. Even with a deal in
place, Iran was arming and training
and equipping all these groups in the
region and conducting cyber attacks
and building these missiles unabated.
That is what was going on. Now they
are feeling it.
By the way, today Iran is generating
a lot less revenue than they were when
the deal was in place. We are at a point
now where even Hezbollah is out there
openly saying they have had to cut
back. They have budget cuts. They are
putting out leaflets and things they
posted publicly inside of Lebanon ask-
ing people to donate to Hezbollah be-
cause Iran can’t donate as much as
they used to. They have real fiscal con-
straints. That is not a bad thing. Like-
wise, with some of these Shia militias
and others, it has constrained Iran’s
ability to operate.
Iran has decided the only way to re-
verse this is to force us back to some
negotiation at some point to either, A,
intimidate us back into the deal or, B,
force us to the negotiating table to get
something like it. How can they do
that?
How can Iran position itself with
some strength in order to get into that
kind of negotiation? They can’t sanc-
tion us economically. The only thing
they can do is these terrorist attacks—
these sort of attacks that started to
connect. That is what they are in the
pattern of doing.
Do you realize, last week, over a pe-
riod of 7 days, every single day there
was a Shia militia attack against a
U.S. installation? Luckily, nobody
died, but that was happening. That is
what they were trying and are trying
to do.
They were trying to position them-
selves and accumulate some strength
so they can get into future negotia-
tions from a position of strength. The
only way they think they can do that
is by threatening to attack us and,
most interestingly, to attack us with
some level of deniability. You have
this tanker out there in the middle of
the Gulf, which is a huge ocean, and
suddenly some mines blow up, and you
have journalists and politicians saying,
how do we know it was Iran? Who was
it? It wasn’t the Swedes. It wasn’t the
Germans. It wasn’t the French. It
wasn’t Luxembourg. There is only one
organization in that part of the world
with the capability to do what hap-
pened—Iran. Everybody knows it.
The only reason some countries don’t
admit it is because then they would
have to do something about it. If you
are a European country and you want
the Iran deal to come back in place and
you want to save it, you can’t say you
know Iran put those mines on those
ships. If you say that, you have to pull
out of the deal. That is why they
wouldn’t acknowledge it.
We have them on video. I heard peo-
ple ask how we know those were Ira-
nians. This is ridiculous stuff. By the
way, the mines look identical to the
ones Iran makes. So they did that.
That was their plan, OK? Their plan
was to attack us using other forces but
to have some level of deniability. ‘‘It
was not us.’’
They also know that there are divi-
sions in American politics and that the
President is unpopular in many coun-
tries. A lot of people around the world
and in the United States would love
nothing more than to say ‘‘Yes, how do
we know it was Iran?’’ for different rea-
sons. That is what they were banking
on, but then they shot down an un-
manned U.S. vehicle, and they admit-
ted it because that would have been
very difficult to deny. That is what
really kicked off a lot of this argument
that we are now hearing.
I want everybody to remember, if you
go back 3 or 4 weeks, that there were
people in the building and people on
television—I saw them—commentators
and others—who were basically imply-
ing that this was all not true, that
there was no threat emanating from
Iran, that it wasn’t doing anything un-
usual. Now they are admitting that
Iran is doing something unusual and
dangerous, but 3 or 4 weeks ago, they
were basically implying that this was
all being made up by people who want-
ed a war.
Think that through logically. That
means there would be dozens and doz-
ens of career service men and women in
the U.S. Armed Forces and in the Pen-
tagon who would be, basically, lying to
us about this. That is absurd.
So we get to the point of how this
really got us here. It wasn’t the deal
with Iran or the pulling out of the deal
that caused this. This has always been.
This is what Iran has always done, and
it has been doing it for two decades

now and longer. To somehow act as if
Iran is more belligerent today than it
was 6 months ago or 6 years ago is just
not true. It is just that the threats
have become more imminent directly
against us.
When you look at this amendment,
the amendment is basically designed to
say that the President cannot enter
into a war unless Congress approves it,
which is an interesting dynamic.
No. 1, when you hear people saying
you need authority from Congress,
what they are talking about is the War
Powers Resolution. In the aftermath of
Vietnam and that era, Congress said,
from now on, we are not getting into
any more of these undeclared wars. If a
President is going to commit service
men and women for an extended period
of time, it has to come through Con-
gress.
No President—no administration—
has ever accepted that resolution as
being in the Constitution. From that
point forward, every single administra-
tion—Democrat and Republican—has
taken the position that this is an un-
constitutional infringement on the
power of the Commander in Chief. That
has been the official position of every
administration, Republican and Demo-
crat, since that passed.
Nonetheless, on various occasions,
Presidents have come to Congress for
authority, which I think is a smart
thing to do, especially for an extended
engagement, because we are stronger
and our policies are more effective
when Congress and the American peo-
ple are behind you. That is why Presi-
dent George W. Bush sought the au-
thorization for Afghanistan and why he
sought it for Iraq. It was the right
thing to do, and it made sense. Yet no
President has ever admitted that it is
constitutional, and I share that view.
For a moment, let’s assume that it
were. Well, that resolution lays out
three things that must happen before a
President, a Commander in Chief, can
commit U.S. forces to a hostility, to a
war, to a fight.
The first thing is that there has to be
a declaration of war. That is in the
Constitution too. Congress can declare
war.
The second is that Congress can au-
thorize the use of force. That is when
you hear all of this talk about the au-
thorization for use of military force,
the AUMF. That is what we had in Af-
ghanistan, and that is what we had in
Iraq. That is what a lot of people
around here think we need if we are
going to do something with Iraq.
There is a third component they like
to ignore, and the third component is
that a President can institute U.S.
military action if Congress declares
war, if Congress authorizes the use of
force, or, No. 3, if there is an emer-
gency that causes us to respond to an
attack against the United States, our
territories, our holdings, or our Armed
Forces.
I want to tell you that if a Shia mili-
tia attacks a U.S. base in Iraq, this is
a pretty clear attack on the Armed
Forces. If it shoots down one of our un-
manned, unarmed platforms over inter-
national airspace, that is an attack on
our Armed Forces. If they try to kid-
nap or murder an ambassador or a dip-
lomat by attacking our Embassy, that
is an attack on a U.S. territory since
embassies are sovereign territories.
If you look at what the administra-
tion has done, the only thing the ad-
ministration has done when it has
come to the use of force is it has made
sure that we have had enough ships and
enough airplanes and enough personnel
and enough assets in the Middle East
so, if we are attacked, we can respond.
That is the only thing it has done.
I don’t know how you read the plain
text of the language that they are
wrapping themselves around—those
who criticize what the administration
has done—and not realize that it is
fully authorized. If we are attacked,
the President doesn’t just have a right
to respond—he has an obligation.
Think of the reverse. If the Iranians
were to attack a facility in Iraq and
murder 100 Americans who would be
working at an embassy or diplomats or
if they were to kill 200 soldiers, the
first questions that every one of the
President’s critics would be asking on
TV would be: Why didn’t we have
enough forces in the region to protect
them? Why didn’t we have a plan to
save them? There would be congres-
sional hearings, and there would be
Members of Congress who would
scream at the administration: Why
didn’t you have people there to save
them?
In anticipating that this could hap-
pen, our military leaders, in their look-
ing at the threats and understanding
the environment, asked the adminis-
tration to send additional forces so
they may be prepared—to be in a posi-
tion of having enough people and assets
to respond in case of an attack.
I will go further than that.
Imagine the President is given
verifiable information that an attack
is imminent by Iran or one of its prox-
ies and that the only way to save
American lives is to wipe out the place
from which it is going to launch the at-
tack. Even if you acted first, that is
self-defense. You are getting ahead of
preventing an attack, not to mention
the fact that the best way to respond
to an attack is to prevent it from hap-
pening in the first place, and having a
force posture in the region is one of the
best ways to do that. That is the only
thing that has been done here.
This amendment is just not nec-
essary because, in assuming they are
arguing that the War Powers Resolu-
tion makes pretty clear what
Congress’s power and role are in all of
this, in the very text of that resolu-
tion, it makes clear that a President
has a right to introduce military forces
and to use military force to defend
Americans, to defend America, and to
defend our Armed Forces.
So why do we need language that
says that a second time? Some would
say: Well, it is redundant, and it is al-
ready the law. Why not just vote for it
again?
That is the final and, perhaps, the
most important point in all of this—
that the timing couldn’t really be
worse. It is not necessary, but the re-
dundancy here is actually damaging,
and here is why.
I think sometimes we make a terrible
mistake in American politics. We as-
cribe our attributes to those of the
leaders of other countries. When we
hear that the President of Iran said
something, we think Iran’s President
and his system is like ours. They are
not. The President of Iran doesn’t have
one-tenth the power of our President,
meaning there is a Supreme Leader,
and everything goes to the Supreme
Leader, a cleric. That is where the
power really resides.
No. 2, we make a terrible mistake of
believing that they truly understand
us, our systems, and our debates when
they don’t, especially the Ayatollah.
He is not a world traveler nor a con-
stitutional expert nor a consumer of a
varied amount of news and information
from around the world nor a nuanced
person who understands that this
amendment, for example, is never
going to become law.
Here is what they do believe, and I
encourage all Members here to go out
and inform themselves as to this. As a
Senator, one has the opportunity to do
it. They do believe that this President
cannot respond. They believe that this
President cannot and would not re-
spond. They believe that there is a
threshold—that there are x numbers of
Americans they can kill and that there
are certain types of attacks they can
get away with without getting a re-
sponse back. That is what they believe.
Why do they believe it?
No. 1, it is that our President has
talked on various occasions about
withdrawing all Americans from the
region. So they begin by believing, by
and large, that we don’t even want to
be there.
No. 2, they believe it because they
look at our domestic politics, and they
say: I have heard the debates, and I
watched 5 minutes of CNN or some
other network the other night, and I
heard people on there who were from
Congress or wherever who told the
President he can’t do this and can’t do
that. There is no support in America
for responding, so the President is con-
strained in what he is able to do.
Why is that a problem?
It is because that is where you mis-
calculate. That is where what they
think would trigger a response and
what will actually trigger a response
are two very different things.
If this thing were to pass—and I
know there are still a couple of people
who are thinking about voting for it—
this would not be reported as an
amendment that had passed on a bill
but that was never going to become

S4648 June 27, 2019
how it would be reported. In fact, if
there were a close vote on it, as I an-
ticipate there will be, the way it would
be reported would be as ‘‘even a hand-
ful of Republicans and virtually every
Democrat voted to send the President a
message of ‘we don’t want you using
Armed Forces in wars against Iran.’ ’’
That is how it would be reported. That
is how they would read it. It would
only reinforce this belief among some
in that regime that they can go further
than they actually can.
I don’t mean to say this to argue that
there are Members of this body here
who are deliberately putting the men
and women of our Armed Forces in
danger. I am telling them I don’t know
if they have thought through that part
of it. What we do here and how it is
perceived in other parts of the world,
especially in a reclusive organization
such as the regime in Iran, are often
two very different things.
The danger with this amendment is
that it is going to confirm to several
hard-liners in that regime that the
President is constrained, that Amer-
ica’s President will not be able to re-
spond, and that they will be able to get
away with more than they actually
will get away with.
In some ways, ironically, I believe
that even a big vote on this—but, cer-
tainly, the passage of it—increases the
chance of war. I say that because, if
they miscalculate and they read into
this an opportunity to attack at a
higher level without taking a retalia-
tory response, they are going to do it.
Then they are going to be wrong, and
then the retaliation will come. Then it
is on. Then we can’t predict what will
happen next.
What happens next is terrifying to
even contemplate because what hap-
pens next could be a Hezbollah strike
against Israel and Israel’s responding
10 times stronger. It could be
Hezbollah’s moving to abduct, kill,
murder American diplomats or per-
sonnel inside of Lebanon; it could be
Shia militias throughout Iraq and
Syria attacking U.S. personnel; it
could be increased Houthi attacks not
just into Saudi Arabia but potentially
even hitting civilian populations and
Saudi Arabia’s responding back. What
could come next is a spiraling series of
events that could lead to a dangerous
regional war. That is not an exaggera-
tion. Neither is it an exaggeration to
believe that a miscalculation on the
part of Iran and what it can get away
with would trigger that.
This is an unnecessary amendment
because, if you accept the War Powers
Resolution as valid under our Constitu-
tion—I do not—it already reads that
the President has a right to respond in
self-defense. The administration has
made it very clear that this is the only
way it intends to use it. It has made it
abundantly clear. In fact, its force pos-
ture proves it. If you look at what we
have in the region—the number of
ships and the number of people—we are
not postured for an invasion or an all-
out war. We are postured for defensive
operations and retaliatory strikes to
an attack, and that is what the admin-
istration says it intends to do.
What it intends to do is to continue
forward, strangling the sources of fi-
nancing that the Iranian regime is
using to sponsor terrorism and its bal-
listic missile program and having
enough force in the region to protect
our men and women who serve us if
they were to come under attack. The
President is allowed to do that in the
Constitution and in the War Powers
Resolution.
All this amendment does is create a
dangerous opportunity to be misread
and to cause Iran to do something, and
that will trigger a response. Then we
will have a war. For those who are con-
sidering still voting for this because
they want to reassert Congress’s role,
this is the wrong time and place in
which to do it.
I will close with this. I don’t agree
with all of the President’s foreign pol-
icy views. I can tell you, for example,
that I do believe that openly talking
about getting out of the Middle East as
soon as possible has emboldened some
of this thinking that America is con-
strained and that we really don’t have
the dedication or the commitment to
see this through if we are attacked.
Yet, in fairness, this President is far
less likely to get into a war or to start
one than was his predecessor—or his
two predecessors, actually. He showed
great restraint the other day.
It strikes me that not only is this un-
necessary from a policy perspective, it
is also unnecessary from a personality
perspective. This is not a President
who is looking to start wars. This is a
President who is looking to get out of
the ones we are already in. Again, I
just don’t know why we would run the
risk of putting something out there
that could be misconstrued and lead to
an attack when we have a President
who has no intention of starting a war,
when we have a military posture in the
region that would not support an offen-
sive military operation or anything
close to what Afghanistan or Iraq was
like, and when we have this danger of
miscalculation.
The amendment has been filed, and
there will be a vote on it tomorrow. I
just hope that the handful of people
still thinking about it will consider all
of these points.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Indian Com-
munity Economic Enhancement Act of 2019’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(1)(A) to bring industry and economic de-
velopment to Indian communities, Indian
Tribes must overcome a number of barriers,
including—
(i) geographical location;
(ii) lack of infrastructure or capacity;
(iii) lack of sufficient collateral and cap-
ital; and
(iv) regulatory bureaucracy relating to—
(I) development; and
(II) access to services provided by the Fed-
eral Government; and
(B) the barriers described in subparagraph
(A) often add to the cost of doing business in
Indian communities;
(2) Indian Tribes—
(A) enact laws and exercise sovereign gov-
ernmental powers;
(B) determine policy for the benefit of
Tribal members; and
(C) produce goods and services for con-
sumers;
(3) the Federal Government has—
(A) an important government-to-govern-
ment relationship with Indian Tribes; and
(B) a role in facilitating healthy and sus-
tainable Tribal economies;
(4) the input of Indian Tribes in developing
Federal policy and programs leads to more
meaningful and effective measures to assist
Indian Tribes and Indian entrepreneurs in
building Tribal economies;
(5)(A) many components of Tribal infra-
structure need significant repair or replace-
ment; and
(B) access to private capital for projects in
Indian communities—
(i) may not be available; or
(ii) may come at a higher cost than such
access for other projects;
(6)(A) Federal capital improvement pro-
grams, such as those that facilitate tax-ex-
empt bond financing and loan guarantees,
are tools that help improve or replace crum-
bling infrastructure;
(B) lack of parity in treatment of an Indian
Tribe as a governmental entity under Fed-
eral tax and certain other regulatory laws
impedes, in part, the ability of Indian Tribes
to raise capital through issuance of tax ex-
empt debt, invest as an accredited investor,
and benefit from other investment incen-
tives accorded to State and local govern-
mental entities; and
(C) as a result of the disparity in treat-
ment of Indian Tribes described in subpara-
graph (B), investors may avoid financing, or
demand a premium to finance, projects in In-
dian communities, making the projects more
costly or inaccessible;
(7) there are a number of Federal loan
guarantee programs available to facilitate fi-
nancing of business, energy, economic, hous-
ing, and community development projects in
Indian communities, and those programs
may support public-private partnerships for
infrastructure development, but improve-
ments and support are needed for those pro-
grams specific to Indian communities to fa-
cilitate more effectively private financing
for infrastructure and other urgent develop-
ment needs; and
(8)(A) most real property held by Indian
Tribes is trust or restricted land that essen-
tially cannot be held as collateral; and
(B) while creative solutions, such as lease-
hold mortgages, have been developed in re-
sponse to the problem identified in subpara-
graph (A), some solutions remain subject to
review and approval by the Bureau of Indian
Affairs, adding additional costs and delay to
Tribal projects.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(1) entrepreneurs face specific challenges
when transforming ideas into profitable busi-
ness enterprises;
(2) entrepreneurs that want to provide
products and services in reservation commu-
nities face an additional set of challenges
that requires special knowledge;
(3) a business incubator is an organization
that assists entrepreneurs in navigating ob-
stacles that prevent innovative ideas from
becoming viable businesses by providing
services that include—
(A) workspace and facilities resources;
(B) access to capital, business education,
and counseling;
(C) networking opportunities;
(D) mentorship opportunities; and
(E) an environment intended to help estab-
lish and expand business operations;
(4) the business incubator model is suited
to accelerating entrepreneurship in reserva-
tion communities because the business incu-
bator model promotes collaboration to ad-
dress shared challenges and provides individ-
ually tailored services for the purpose of
overcoming obstacles unique to each partici-
pating business; and
(5) business incubators will stimulate eco-
nomic development by providing Native en-
trepreneurs with the tools necessary to grow
businesses that offer products and services to
reservation communities.

Congress finds that—

Congress, the Corps of Engineers inves-
tigated the Columbia River and its tribu-
taries to determine sites at which power
could be produced at low cost;
(2) under section 10(e) of the Federal Power
Act (16 U.S.C. 803(e)), when licenses are
issued involving tribal land within an Indian
reservation, a reasonable annual charge shall
be fixed for the use of the land, subject to
the approval of the Indian tribe having juris-
diction over the land;
(3) in August 1933, the Columbia Basin
Commission, an agency of the State of Wash-
ington, received a preliminary permit from
the Federal Power Commission for water
power development at the Grand Coulee site;
(4) had the Columbia Basin Commission or
a private entity developed the site, the Spo-
kane Tribe would have been entitled to a
reasonable annual charge for the use of the
land of the Spokane Tribe;
(5) in the mid-1930s, the Federal Govern-
ment, which is not subject to licensing under
the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 792 et
seq.)—
(A) federalized the Grand Coulee Dam
project; and
(B) began construction of the Grand Coulee
Dam;
(6) when the Grand Coulee Dam project was
federalized, the Federal Government recog-
nized that—
(A) development of the project affected the
interests of the Spokane Tribe and the Con-
federated Tribes of the Colville Reservation;
and
(B) it would be appropriate for the Spokane
and Colville Tribes to receive a share of rev-
enue from the disposition of power produced
at Grand Coulee Dam;
(7) in the Act of June 29, 1940 (16 U.S.C. 835d
et seq.), Congress—
(A) granted to the United States—
(i) in aid of the construction, operation,
and maintenance of the Columbia Basin
Project, all the right, title, and interest of
the Spokane Tribe and Colville Tribes in and
to the tribal and allotted land within the
Spokane and Colville Reservations, as des-
ignated by the Secretary of the Interior from
time to time; and
(ii) other interests in that land as required
and as designated by the Secretary for cer-
tain construction activities undertaken in
connection with the project; and
(B) provided that compensation for the
land and other interests was to be deter-
mined by the Secretary in such amounts as
the Secretary determined to be just and eq-
uitable;
(8) pursuant to that Act, the Secretary
paid—
(A) to the Spokane Tribe, $4,700; and
(B) to the Confederated Tribes of the
Colville Reservation, $63,000;
(9) in 1994, following litigation under the
Act of August 13, 1946 (commonly known as
the ‘‘Indian Claims Commission Act’’ (60
Stat. 1049, chapter 959; former 25 U.S.C. 70 et
seq.)), Congress ratified the Colville Settle-
ment Agreement, which required—
(A) for past use of the land of the Colville
Tribes, a payment of $53,000,000; and
(B) for continued use of the land of the
Colville Tribes, annual payments of
$15,250,000, adjusted annually based on reve-
nues from the sale of electric power from the
Grand Coulee Dam project and transmission
of that power by the Bonneville Power Ad-
ministration;
(10) the Spokane Tribe, having suffered
harm similar to that suffered by the Colville
Tribes, did not file a claim within the 5-year
statute of limitations under the Indian
Claims Commission Act;
(11) neither the Colville Tribes nor the Spo-
kane Tribe filed claims for compensation for
use of the land of the respective tribes with
the Commission prior to August 13, 1951, but
both tribes filed unrelated land claims prior
to August 13, 1951;
(12) in 1976, over objections by the United
States, the Colville Tribes were successful in
amending the 1951 Claims Commission land
claims to add the Grand Coulee claim of the
Colville Tribes;
(13) the Spokane Tribe had no such claim
to amend, having settled the Claims Com-
mission land claims of the Spokane Tribe
with the United States in 1967;
(14) the Spokane Tribe has suffered signifi-
cant harm from the construction and oper-
ation of Grand Coulee Dam;
(15) Spokane tribal acreage taken by the
United States for the construction of Grand
Coulee Dam equaled approximately 39 per-
cent of Colville tribal acreage taken for con-
struction of the dam;
(16) the payments and delegation made
pursuant to this Act constitute fair and eq-
uitable compensation for the past and con-
tinued use of Spokane tribal land for the pro-
duction of hydropower at Grand Coulee Dam;
and
(17) by vote of the Spokane tribal member-
ship, the Spokane Tribe has resolved that
the payments and delegation made pursuant
to this Act constitute fair and equitable
compensation for the past and continued use
of Spokane tribal land for the production of
hydropower at Grand Coulee Dam.

RECOGNIZING ELLEN CRAIN OF
BUTTE
HON. GREG GIANFORTE
OF MONTANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Ellen Crain of Butte for her 29
years of service as the Director of the Butte-
Silver Bow Public Archives and for trans-
forming the public archives into a renowned
source of research and community pride.
Ellen, a native of Butte, began her work as
director of the archives in 1990. She imme-
diately set out to acquire additional collections
of historical documents, maps, books, and arti-
cles. Outgrowing their current location, the old
Butte Fire Station No. 1, Ellen led an expan-
sion project in 2007. Butte-Silver Bow voters
overwhelming supported her efforts and
passed a $7.5 million bond for the archives.
The project included the renovation of the
historic fire department station that had been
home to the archives since 1981, and an ex-
pansion of two archival vaults and a commu-
nity meeting space.
Under Ellen’s leadership, the Butte-Silver
Bow Public Archives has become a recog-
nized source for research. Approximately
5,000 academic and family historians visit
each year from all over the world. The com-
munity room is a busy place with bi-weekly
brown bag lunches attracting large audiences
and well-known speakers. Outreach efforts in-
clude workshops on preserving family archives
and connecting with various ethnic populations
in the community.
‘‘Butte has had such a historic impact’’ said
Ellen. ‘‘Much of the copper that electrified the
country came from Butte. Hand-in-hand with
that is the historic contributions to organized
labor from a diverse ethnic population. It is
such an honor for me and my staff to rep-
resent Butte. We are always uncovering new
ways to look at old stories.’’
Madam Speaker, for her leadership and
dedication to preserving Montana’s historic im-
pact on the country and the world, I recognize
Ellen Crain for her spirit of Montana.

IN HONOR OF NATIONAL
SUNGLASSES DAY
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize National Sunglasses Day
and the importance of eye protection in the
summer and throughout the year.
Unprotected exposure to UV rays may lead
to serious vision problems including short-term
issues such as sensitivity to light, trouble see-
ing, sunburn of the eyes or eyelids, irritated
eyes, and red or swollen eyes—in addition to
serious long-term issues. Thankfully, this dam-
age can be prevented. Manufacturers and
suppliers in Texas and around the country that
provide sunglasses with UVA/UVB protective
lenses are helping to equip Americans to pro-
tect their eyes.
In the case of eye care, prevention through
protection is critical. As a physician, I com-
mend the Vision Council for its work to edu-
cate Americans on the importance of healthy
vision. On National Sunglasses Day, we are
reminded that everyone can take easy steps
to protect our eyes.

INTERNATIONAL MOTOR SPORTS
ASSOCIATION (IMSA)
HON. MICHAEL WALTZ
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, since the
1940s, Daytona Beach has been the premiere
destination for auto racing.
Fifty years ago, Bill France, Sr. and John
and Peggy Bishop laid a foundation that today
supports one of the most prominent auto rac-
ing organizations in the world—the Inter-
national Motor Sports Association. What
began as a sanctioning body for a Formula
Ford and Formula Vee race at Pocono Race-
way has grown to become an international
powerhouse specializing in world-class sports
car competition.
This year, IMSA, based in Daytona Beach,
turns 50. It comes from humble beginnings.
The IMSA started as a race with fewer than
330 attendees has expanded by leaps and
bounds over the last 50 years now boasts
some of the largest attendance numbers in its
history.
Here in my district, we understand the ex-
citement and the benefits of our car racing.
IMSA has been an important piece of our
community, debuting its Grand-Am road racing
circuit in 2000 at Daytona.
This year, the IMSA will lead seven motor-
sports platforms and deliver live coverage to
racing fans all over the world.
It’s an honor to recognize the IMSA and
their contributions to our district and the racing
community. I’d like to congratulate them on 50
years worth being proud of. Here’s to many
more.

IN SUPPORT OF THE SHERRILL
AMENDMENT NO. 191 TO H.R. 3055
HON. MIKIE SHERRILL
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, today I
rise today in support of the en-bloc amend-
ment, and to thank the Interior and Environ-
ment Appropriations Subcommittee Chair-
woman, Ms. MCCOLLUM, for including the
Sherrill Amendment No. 191 in the en-bloc
package.
My amendment ensures that the EPA will
continue to provide adequate funding, $8 mil-
lion, for the Children’s Environmental Health
and Disease Prevention Research Centers.
The Children’s Centers have made profound
contributions to our scientific understanding of
how exposures to chemicals and pollutants
uniquely impact children and pregnant women.
Researchers working in the Children’s Centers
study how environmental exposures are linked
to adverse health outcomes such as poor birth
outcomes, behavioral and learning deficits,
respiratory issues, and childhood cancers.
All children deserve a healthy environment
where they can grow and thrive. It is impera-
tive that we support the research necessary to
understand how our environment impacts chil-
dren and families’ health and wellbeing.
I am concerned that the grants that currently
fund thirteen Children’s Centers are set to ex-
pire in July and that no announcement has
been made to indicate renewed funding. To
ensure that these valuable programs can con-
tinue, I am offering an amendment and asking
the House of Representative to vote in strong
support of the Children’s Centers and their im-
portant work.
I thank Interior and Environment Appropria-
tions Subcommittee Chairwoman MCCOLLUM
and Ranking Member JOYCE for their leader-
ship in adopting this important provision.

SPEECH OF
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 24, 2019
The House in Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union had under
consideration the bill (H.R. 3055) making ap-
propriations for the Departments of Com-
merce and Justice, Science, and Related
Agencies for the fiscal year ending Sep-
tember 30, 2020, and for other purposes:
Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chair, as many of
bridges across the nation are reaching the end
of their useful lives, it is important for the De-
partment to prioritize funding for the design of
new structures needed to replace these out of
date and outmoded bridges. This is most crit-
ical for bridges that constitute essential com-
ponents of evacuation routes, such as our two
Cape Cod bridges. When these structures are
owned by the United States Government, we
have both a legal and a moral responsibility to
ensure that they are adequate to the demands
put upon them.
In my district, nearly 250,000 of my constitu-
ents live on the peninsula of Cape Cod and
the Islands of Martha’s Vineyard and Nan-
tucket. In the event of an emergency, these
citizens’ only available evacuation route is

over the Cape Cod Canal bridges. The Canal
bridges were completed in 1935 and 1938.
They were constructed for the age of the
Model T, and not the age of the SUV.
The Canal bridges are now insufficient for
the needs of the Cape and Islands community.
The lanes on the bridges are too narrow, and
do not reflect current federal highway stand-
ards. They lack a breakdown lane that could
be used for additional road space in an emer-
gency. With the Canal bridges in their current
state on a busy summer weekend, the traffic
can back up for miles. During an evacuation
scenario, this congestion would be far worse
and pose a real risk to public safety.
The Cape Cod Canal bridges have reached
the end of their useful lives, and modern re-
placements for them will be needed within the
next several years. Replacementt bridges
must be designed soon so that the United
States Government can live up to its responsi-
bility to provide transit for Cape Cod residents
and visitors over the Cape Cod Canal—espe-
cially in the event of an emergency.
The Canal bridges, and projects like them
across the nation, need funding to support
them through the costly design phase. Without
designs in hand, it is impossible for transpor-
tation planners to precisely estimate the scope
of work and costs of replacing this aging infra-
structure so they can move forward towards
construction. That is why my amendment is so
important not only for our community, but
communities like ours around the country.

HONORING JOHN JOSEPH
MANFREDA
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to remember John Jo-
seph Manfreda for his lifelong belief in and
staunch commitment to exceptional public
service.
Born in Washington, DC, Mr. Manfreda re-
ceived his undergraduate degree in business
finance and economics from the University of
Maryland. He earned his law degree from the
American University School of Law in 1970
and earned a master’s degree in tax law from
Georgetown University Law Center in 1974.
Mr. Manfreda began his almost 50-year career
in public service at the Bureau of Alcohol, To-
bacco, and Firearms (ATF) Counsel Office
and its Internal Revenue Service predecessor.
From 1999 to 2003, he served as Chief Coun-
sel for ATF. Mr. Manfreda was integral to the
founding of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and
Trade Bureau (TTB). He served TTB as the
Deputy Administrator before being appointed
to the Administrator of the Bureau in 2005.
Mr. Manfreda was widely respected for his
knowledge, fairness, and honesty by his col-
leagues and those he worked with in the in-
dustry he regulated. He helped write many al-
cohol laws when he served as Counsel for
ATF and retained the information about those
laws. He was a fair man and was always will-
ing to listen. Mr. Manfreda was an honorable
man of character who valued honesty and
demonstrated that value. Mr. Manfreda was
recognized for his important work with the
Meritorious and Distinguished Presidential
Rank Awards and the Lifetime Achievement
Award from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
and Firearms.
Madam Speaker, John Joseph Manfreda
was a dedicated public servant who held the
sincere belief in the good of public service. He
inspired his coworkers and was a friend and
mentor to all who knew him and a devoted
family man to his wife, children, and grand-
children. It is therefore fitting and proper that
we remember the life and honor the service of
John Joseph Manfreda here today.

RECOGNIZING THE 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE USCGC ‘‘MACKI-
NAW’’ IN CHEBOYGAN, MICHIGAN
HON. JACK BERGMAN
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my
honor to recognize the 75th anniversary of the
United States Coast Guard Cutter Mackinaw,
based out of Cheboygan, Michigan.
The original Icebreaker Mackinaw (WAGB–
83) was constructed during World War II to fa-
cilitate winter shipping over the Great Lakes
and maintain year-round war-time production
of steel. Cheboygan served as her home port
as she played this critical role. After more than
62 years of outstanding service facilitating
commerce in support of the economy and se-
curity of the entire nation, the original Macki-
naw was decommissioned in 2006 and re-
placed with the USCGC Mackinaw (WLBB–
30). Performing the same critical icebreaking
role as her namesake, the Mackinaw also
serves year-round as an Aids to Navigation
ship and conducts law enforcement, search
and rescue, and environmental emergency re-
sponse missions. Its unique design makes it
exceptionally maneuverable and capable of
breaking smooth ice up to 42 inches thick.
Since the first ship was launched 75 years
ago, the impact of the Mackinaw on economy
and security of Michigan and the entire coun-
try cannot be overstated.
The anniversary celebration for the Macki-
naw will take place as a part of the 8th Annual
Michigan Waterways festival, a 4-day commu-
nity celebration of the Michigan Inland Water-
way and Northern Michigan, running from
June 27th to the 30th.
Madam Speaker, the celebration of the 8th
Annual Waterways Festival is the perfect op-
portunity for us to appreciate the history and
service of the USCGC Mackinaw and her
crew. Michiganders can take immense pride in
knowing that the First District is home to such
an important vessel. On behalf of my constitu-
ents, I wish the Mackinaw, her crew, and the
city of Cheboygan all the best in their future
endeavors.

COMMANDER JAMES B. MILLS
HON. KEVIN HERN
OF OKLAHOMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Madam
Speaker, this week, I welcomed to my office a
family of constituents in town to celebrate the
life and legacy of a fallen war hero at Arlington
National Cemetery.
The Geiger family traveled here to honor the
life of their relative Commander James B.
Mills, who died more than 50 years ago while
serving in the Navy.
Commander Mills’ plane disappeared from
radar just past midnight on September 21,
1966. No distress call was heard, no one saw
the plane go down, and extensive aerial
searches yielded no clues as to what hap-
pened to Commander Mills and his copilot
James Bauder.
For more than 50 years, Commander Mills’
family had no closure on his loss, until about
a year ago when his remains were found off
the coast of Vietnam.
This week, Commander Mills was honored
with a burial at the Arlington National Ceme-
tery attended by more than 300 people who
came to celebrate his life and finally put Com-
mander Mills to rest in his home country as
the hero he is. Commander Mills and his loved
ones have found peace at last.

CARIBBEAN AMERICAN HERITAGE
HON. STACEY E. PLASKETT
OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, as Ameri-
cans begin many of the pastimes of summer
that are quintessentially American—baseball,
backyard barbeques, family road trips—Carib-
bean Americans spend the month of June re-
flecting on their contributions and melded cul-
tures in the United States.
Congress adopted H. Con. Res. 71 which
established the Caribbean American Heritage
month, sponsored by Congresswoman Bar-
bara Lee and signed into law by President
George W. Bush in 2006. ‘‘Whereas people of
Caribbean heritage are found in every State of
the Union . . .’’ is the first line of the U.S.
House of Representatives’ resolution to estab-
lish a Caribbean American Heritage month.
While the Act establishing Caribbean Amer-
ican Heritage month emphasized the present
influence of Caribbean Americans, American
history would not be complete without the inte-
gration and support of Caribbean people.
From America’s founding to the present, Car-
ibbean people have supported and assisted in
the creation of a collective American identify—
the articulation of the nation’s rightful place in
the world, its traditions, its language and cul-
tural style.

DEPUTY SHERIFF MATTHEW
MORENO
HON. KEN BUCK
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the dedication and sacrifice of a fall-
en Deputy Sheriff, Matthew Moreno.
A resident of Trinidad, Colorado, Matthew
proudly served his community as a full-time
Deputy Sheriff in Las Animas County. He also
worked part-time as an Emergency Medical
Technician (EMT) for the Trinidad Ambulance
District. In Matthew’s free time, he volunteered
as a firefighter—quickly rising to the rank of
Fire Captain.
On December 12, 2018, Matthew was
struck by an impaired driver while responding
to a domestic disturbance call. Tragically, he
did not survive the accident.
Our nation owes a debt of gratitude to our
police, fire fighters, and first responders, espe-
cially our fallen heroes. Matthew’s commitment
to serving others exceeded expectations, and
his willingness to put his life on the line to pro-
tect others will never be forgotten. On behalf
of the Fourth Congressional District of Colo-
rado, I extend my deepest gratitude for Mat-
thew’s service and deepest condolences to his
family, friends, and the entire community that
undoubtedly feels his loss.
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to recognize
the life of Deputy Sheriff Matthew Moreno for
his commitment to family, community, and the
United States of America.

RECOGNIZING THE CUMBERLAND
CONTAINER CORPORATION’S 50TH
ANNIVERSARY
HON. JOHN W. ROSE
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Cum-
berland Container Corporation in honor of its
50th anniversary.
A time-honored mainstay of Putnam County,
Cumberland Container Corporation was grant-
ed its corporate charter by the State of Ten-
nessee on October 21, 1968. Nine months
later, this company planted its roots in a
6,000-square-foot building in Monterey, Ten-
nessee. At its commencement, this company
served the area by providing manufacturing
containers and packaging materials to local
businesses with nothing more than four pieces
of used equipment and six employees.
Cumberland Container Corporation was
dedicated to its belief in efficiently supplying
local companies. Although times proved to be
tough at the beginning, this company per-
severed and demonstrated the brilliance of
this concept through consistent customer
growth over the last five decades.
Fast forward to this year, Cumberland Con-
tainer Corporation is currently operating in a
260,000-square-foot building on over 18 acres
of land. By current count, Cumberland Con-
tainer Corporation now employs 85 associates
and owns a vast assortment of machinery for
its production and logistical needs.
To my House colleagues here today, I hope
that you will join me in recognizing the Cum-
berland Container Corporation for their long-
standing service to the community. It is the
hardworking nature of this company and its
employees that truly reflect exactly what it
means to be a Tennessean.

CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF
DR. EDWARD J. LUKOMSKI AT
PATHWAYS, INC.
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
celebrate the service of Dr. Edward J.
Lukomski to Pathways, Inc. and congratulate
him on his retirement.
For the last sixteen years, Dr. Ed Lukomski
has served as the President and Chief Execu-
tive Officer of Pathways, Inc. which provides
services to two thousand people in fifteen
counties. Pathways, Inc. is a not-for-profit
human service organization offering in-home,
community, and foster care services to youth
with serious emotional disturbances, intellec-
tual and developmental disabilities, and chron-
ic medical conditions. Under Ed’s leadership,
Pathways has grown exponentially, not only in
services and programs offered, but also geo-
graphically in their area of service coverage.
Ed’s dedication and hard work has ensured
the expansion of opportunities for youths in
need of aid, and for that we must commend
him.
To recognize his outstanding service, Path-
ways will be dedicating their Broad Street fa-
cility in Horseheads, New York, in his honor.
The newly renamed ‘‘Lukomski Center’’ will
stand as a fitting tribute to Ed’s legacy as
Pathways continues his work to expand serv-
ices to youths in need.
As Ed moves forward with the next chapter
of his life, we applaud his tireless efforts to
help youth in our communities and we wish
him all the best in his retirement.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
celebrate Ed Lukomski and his extraordinary
career.
COLONEL SETH KRUMMRICH RE-
LINQUISHES COMMAND OF THE
FORT IRWIN GARRISON
HON. PAUL COOK
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the contributions of U.S. Army Colo-
nel Seth Krummrich, who will relinquish com-
mand of the Fort Irwin Garrison on June 27,
2019. Colonel Krummrich is leaving for his
next duty assignment as the Chief of Staff,
Special Operations Command Central
(SOCCENT) at MacDill Air Force Base in
Tampa, Florida.
Since Colonel Krummrich assumed com-
mand of the Fort Irwin Garrison, I have been
impressed by his hard work on behalf of the
Army. During his command, Colonel
Krummrich oversaw the completion of Weed
Army Community Hospital, a $211 million im-
provement designed to bring medical facilities
at the garrison into the 21st century. In addi-
tion to the successful completion of the hos-
pital, Colonel Krummrich has worked closely
with my staff and I on several proposed
projects to further improve Fort Irwin and bet-
ter support the Army’s critical training mission.
While these projects were not completed dur-
ing his tenure, his hard work has laid the foun-
dation for their future success.
In addition to thanking Colonel Krummrich
for his service at Fort Irwin, I would also like
to recognize his outstanding military career.
Colonel Krummrich is a combat veteran with
numerous deployments to both Iraq and Af-
ghanistan, including participating in the initial
invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 as a member
of the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne).
His service on the battlefield is complimented
by his impressive educational background,
where he was most recently a senior Military
Fellow at Stanford University. While I wish him
the best at SOCCENT, I will miss the passion,
energy, and determination that he brought to
the Fort Irwin Garrison.

IN HONOR OF W.S. EVERETT
HON. BRETT GUTHRIE
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the life and service of Wilson Spen-
cer ‘‘W.S.’’ Everett of Glasgow, Kentucky. Mr.
Everett was a proud patriot throughout his life,
serving in the Kentucky National Guard and
the United States Army during the Korean
War.
For the last 30 years, Mr. Everett dedicated
his time to honor the legacies of his fellow sol-
diers, whether through his involvement with
the Glasgow chapter of the Disabled American
Veterans, or his regular participation with the
Chapter 20 Color Guard. Mr. Everett also de-
signed two memorials in my district: the
Hiseville Veterans Memorial and the Glasgow-
Barren County Veterans Wall of Honor. His
dedication to this endeavor was so great that
even in his final days, Mr. Everett went to the
Wall of Honor to install the final veteran’s title.
Today, I join with Mr. Everett’s family in re-
membering the legacy that he left behind. He
is truly an American patriot that strived to live
his life in honor of each fold of the flag and I
am grateful for his service not only to the
country, but also to his community.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF MT. PLEASANT
BAPTIST CHURCH
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, it is my
honor to rise today to celebrate Mt. Pleasant
Baptist Church’s 100th Anniversary and recog-
nize it for its numerous contributions to the
greater Kansas City area. I am truly honored
to have this house of worship and pillar of
faith in my Congressional District.
Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church is in Kansas
City’s historic 18th and Vine District, a neigh-
borhood critical to the life and development of
the African American community. In the
1920s, 18th and Vine began to grow, becom-
ing a creative hub of African American culture
and shaping the future of Kansas City for the
better. Founded in 1919, Mt. Pleasant Baptist
Church was crucial to this cultural renais-
sance. Churches throughout this period were
centers of community and support. They pro-
vided members hope and encouragement in
the face of seemingly hopeless challenges like
inequality, discrimination, and segregation. For
a century, Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church has
been a vehicle for social justice and change
within Kansas City’s African American commu-
nity.
Today, churches continue to be a keeper of
cultural tradition, a center of storytelling, and
the core of African American community. As
writer Shauntae Brown White wrote, ‘‘Story-
telling that connects is an act of resonance
that fulfills the second tenant of Afrocentric
discourse, creating harmony in the midst of
chaos.’’ For the past 100 years, the congrega-
tion of Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church has pro-
duced some of the brightest leaders,
innovators, thinkers, and artists in Missouri’s
Fifth Congressional District.
Today, Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church serves
as a spiritual anchor within the Kansas City
community. The church transforms the lives of
its members for the better, unites people of all
ages and supports them as they seek to live
according to the teachings of Jesus Christ. For
the past thirty-three years, Pastor L. Hender-
son Bell has led the church to be a house of
hope for those facing adversity in the commu-
nity. Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church not only is a
center of spiritual development but a hub of
service in its community, embodying James
2:17’s assertion that, ‘‘Faith by itself, if it has
no works, is dead.’’ The church serves the
poor and marginalized members of the com-
munity by reaching out to them and providing
educational opportunities, Bible study classes,
health and scholarship trainings, and pro-
grams for music and dance.
Mt. Pleasant Baptist has been and con-
tinues to be an advocate for the underserved
and a champion of the faithful in Kansas City.
Its century worth of contributions to the soul of
Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District are wor-
thy of praise and recognition. Madam Speak-
er, please join me in celebrating and honoring
Pastor L. Henderson Bell and the congrega-
tion of Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church, both past
and present, for achieving this milestone.

FRANCIS OF TIFFIN
HON. JIM JORDAN
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to commend to the House the out-
standing work of the Sisters of Saint Francis
of Tiffin, Ohio, who are marking 150 years of
selfless service to others.
The Tiffin Franciscans were founded by Fa-
ther Joseph L. Bihn and Mrs. Elizabeth Schae-
fer (Sister Mary Francis) in the wake of the
Civil War to care for the needs of orphans and
the elderly. The work of the sisters continues
to be rooted in the words of Matthew’s Gos-
pel: ‘‘Whatever you did to one of the least of
these My brethren, you did to Me.’’
Throughout the years, the sisters have de-
voted themselves to the Franciscan values of
caring for the poor and for all of God’s cre-
ation. Dedicated to spreading the message of
the Gospel, they have served countless peo-
ple through their evangelization, education,
child care, foster care, and other vital min-
istries designed to meet the needs of the Tiffin
community and far beyond.
Madam Speaker, the Sisters of Saint
Francis are marking their sesquicentennial
with events and commemorations throughout
the year. On behalf of the people of Ohio’s
Fourth Congressional District, I am pleased to
join in the accolades to them as they celebrate
this milestone. They have my best wishes and
my thanks for their tireless service to others.

Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor James ‘‘Jim’’ Scordo for over
three decades of service to the North Country
as Executive Director of Credo Community
Center for the Treatment of Addictions.
Jim Scordo has shepherded the community
center through good and bad times since 1988
when he helped the center recover from a
devastating fire. Jim sought help from his
community and graciously raised over
$175,000 dollars to rebuild. When the commu-
nity center opened its substance abuse out-
patient clinic, he was named its first Executive
Director. Since then, countless North Country
residents have found help overcoming addic-
tion and there are many families in Jefferson
County and beyond that are grateful to Jim,
his staff, and volunteers for their loved one’s
health and wellbeing.
The hands on, local efforts of Credo Com-
munity Center and similar centers throughout
the country is crucial in the broader fight
against the opioid epidemic. Communities
need dedicated leadership to ensure that
those services remain consistently available
for those who need them most. On behalf of
New York’s 21st Congressional District, I want
to thank Jim for his leadership and service to
the North Country and wish him the best in
the next chapter.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E859
June 27, 2019
The National Historic Landmark system was
created in 1935 to recognize structures that
are of outstanding historical significance, icons
of ideals that shaped the nation, and pristine
examples of design or construction. There is
no other landmark more deserving of this des-
ignation than the Grand Hotel. First opened in
1887, the hotel was created to serve as a re-
treat for vacationers looking to enjoy summer
on Lake Huron. Over the next 132 years, the
Grand Hotel would grow to become not only a
beloved part of Michigan, but a prominent fea-
ture in popular culture and premier destination
for visitors from around the world. Its unique
design has been widely acclaimed, and its
world’s-largest 660-foot porch has been en-
joyed by everyone from John F. Kennedy and
Gerald Ford to Thomas Edison and Mark
Twain. The National Park Service designated
the hotel as a National Historic Landmark in
1989, citing its historic architecture and rep-
resentation of the American dream of a ‘‘sum-
mer place.’’ Today, its role as a summer place
remains stronger than ever for thousands of
guests to Mackinac Island every year.
Madam Speaker, the celebration of the
Grand Hotel’s 30th anniversary as a National
Historic Landmark is the perfect opportunity
for us to appreciate its unique history, cultural
impact, and significance to Mackinac Island,
Michigan, and the United States. Michiganders
can take immense pride in knowing that the
First District is home to such an important
landmark. On behalf of my constituents, I wish
the Grand Hotel all the best in its future en-
deavors.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE TRADI-

HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the tradition of the Door
County Dairy Breakfast, held in Sturgeon Bay,
Wisconsin.
The Dairy Breakfast is an iconic Door Coun-
ty tradition that provides the community an op-
portunity to learn about the significant role the
dairy industry plays in Wisconsin’s economy.
Community members meet dairy farmers,
learn about the dairy industry, and enjoy deli-
cious Door County coffee and pancakes.
I am grateful to the Sevastopol Future
Farmers of America Alumni Association for or-
ganizing the 38th Annual Dairy Breakfast in
Door County. Their work to recruit sponsors
and volunteers is integral to the success of
this terrific event. Throughout the year, the Se-
vastopol FFA Alumni Association provides
educational opportunities to the community to
increase awareness of Wisconsin’s dairy in-
dustry and the products produced by area
dairy farmers. All proceeds from the Door
County Dairy Breakfast go toward scholar-
ships for current FFA high school seniors.
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this
body to join me in commending the efforts of
the Door County Dairy Breakfast to educate
the community through this time-honored tradi-
tion. Thank you to the Sevastopol FFA Alumni
Association and the countless sponsors and
volunteers for their continued support of Wis-

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA BOARD OF ZONING
ADJUSTMENT HOME RULE ACT
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Board of Zon-
ing Adjustment Home Rule Act. This bill would
give the District of Columbia the authority to
appoint all members of the D.C. Board of Zon-
ing Adjustment (Board), except when the
Board is performing functions regarding an ap-
plication by a foreign mission with respect to
a chancery. The Board issues special excep-
tions, or variances, to the regulations issued
by the D.C. Zoning Commission (Commis-
sion). This bill does not alter the authority of
the Board.
Like every other jurisdiction in the United
States, the District should be free to set its
own local land-use policies. As the District
continues to contend with rapid population
growth and economic development, it is more
important than ever that the members of the
Board are accountable to District residents
and local elected officials.
Under current law, in general, the Board
consists of a representative each from the Na-
tional Capital Planning Commission (NCPC)
and the Commission, each of whom may be a
federal official, and three mayoral appointees,
subject to D.C. Council approval. The Board
has no authority over federal property.
Under current law, when the Board is per-
forming functions regarding an application by
a foreign mission with respect to the location,
expansion or replacement of a chancery, the
Board consists of the Executive Director of
NCPC; the Director of the National Park Serv-
ice, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of
the Interior or the Administrator of General
Services, as designated by the President; and
the three mayoral appointees. This bill does
not change this composition.
This is an important step to recognize and
increase home rule for the District, and I urge
my colleagues to support this bill.

IN RECOGNITION OF MS. SADIE
NELSON
HON. JENNIFER WEXTON
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Ms. Sadie Pike Nelson from Vir-
ginia’s 10th Congressional District for her 70th
birthday on June 24, 2019. Ms. Nelson is an
active member within the 10th Congressional
District which includes her accomplishments
within the Frederick County School system,
United Methodist Women, and Winchester Li-
oness Lions Club.
I commend Ms. Nelson on her lifetime pur-
suit of community activism. After moving to
Winchester, VA in 1980, Ms. Nelson became
a teacher with the special education program
at the Robert E. Aylor Middle School, where
she taught for 25 years. She then became the
Assistant Principal for Admiral Richard E. Byrd
Middle School for seven years before retiring
with 32 years in education all together. Ms.
Nelson was the first African American Admin-
istrator in the history of Frederick County Pub-
lic Schools.
Ms. Nelson joined the John Mann United
Methodist Church in 1985. She is presently
the Administrative Chairman of the church
council, President of the United Methodist
Women, and President of the Usher Board.
She has also served as the Spiritual Growth
Coordinator for the Winchester District of
United Methodist Women for a total of five
years. Outside of the church, Ms. Nelson was
the first African American to be invited to join
the Winchester Lioness Club where she
served as president in 2005, 2006, 2011,
2018, and 2019. Through this organization she
strives to make a difference in women’s lives
with philanthropies that include ownership of a
two-year woman’s college and five programs
that provide higher educational assistance
through scholarships and loans for women to
continue their education.
Ms. Nelson is also the proud mother of one
daughter, proud grandmother of four grand-
daughters, and proud great-grandmother of a
set of twin great-granddaughters and four
great-grandsons.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues
join me in recognizing and applauding Ms.
Sadie Pike Nelson on her accomplishments
and wish her the best for her 70th birthday

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E860 June 27, 2019
In May 1944, 1,100 U.S. military men joined
ranks to form what would be called ‘‘the Ghost
Army.’’
Composed largely of artists, this unit had
unusual orders: not to avoid detection by
enemy forces, but to actively attract attention
through an ingenious optical illusion.
One of them was Staff Sergeant Stanley
Nance, signal Company Special of the 23rd
Headquarters Special Troops.
The Ghost Army’s tactics were to imper-
sonate other Allied units, using inflatable tanks
and jeeps made of sticks and burlap, to make
the enemy believe that large factions of sol-
diers were on Omaha Beach and surrounding
areas, after D-Day.
Massive speakers were mounted to the
back of military vehicles, blasting the ambient
noises of a much larger unit. They sounded
like they were coming from the battlefield, but
in fact had been recorded months before in
fort Knox, Kentucky.
Kept a secret until 1985, the story of the
Ghost Army and those in its ranks serves as
a heroic tale of young Americans’ bold actions
to defend freedom.
Decades later, Staff Sergeant Nance’s
great-granddaughter, Madeline Christianson,
told his story through a history project, which
recently won the World War II History Award
at the National History Competition. Her
project is an amazing re-creation of a story of
skill, courage and triumph—unique in the an-
nals of history.
As we prepare to celebrate Independence
Day 2019, we honor two extraordinary genera-
tions of Utahns—the soldier who helped de-
feat tyranny during World War II, and his
great-granddaughter who is keeping the story
of heroism alive.

SUPPORT OF AMENDMENT NO. 35
TO H.R. 3055
HON. JOE COURTNEY
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in
support of my amendment numbered 35 to Di-
vision A of H.R. 3055 to direct the National In-
stitutes of Standards and Technologies to es-
tablish standards for pyrrhotite in concrete ag-
gregate. Pyrrhotite is a mineral that unfortu-
nately has been mixed into concrete aggre-
gate and is widespread in concrete founda-
tions and residential commercial municipal
buildings in Connecticut and Massachusetts,
and parts of Quebec, Canada, that after expo-
sure to moisture, causes the material to pre-
mature crumbling and collapse because of
rusting.
Estimates are as high as thousands of
structures in the New England region are af-
fected with crumbling foundations, causing
catastrophic losses to homeowners and mu-
nicipalities. By establishing standards for
pyrrhotite content, NIST could mitigate the
problem from occurring in other areas, or at
least reduce the costs of mitigation.
Right now, any level of pyrrhotite is consid-
ered a cancer on a property and makes it un-
marketable. This amendment would allocate
$4 million from the NIST general operations
funds towards pyrrhotite research, which my
office and others have been discussing over
the last year. The amendment would require
NIST to research the best testing methods for
pyrrhotite detection, as well as to develop a
pyrrhotite risk rating scale. This amendment
would utilize the world’s leading researchers to
mitigate the cost of this problem. In addition,
my amendment requests that NIST work with
leading academic institutions in this area to
expedite this research process—including ex-
pediting the procurement process for obtaining
concrete samples, should NIST need to utilize
core samples containing pyrrhotite to conduct
this research.
I urge adoption of this en-bloc package, and
I want to thank Mr. ADERHOLT and Mr.
SERRANO for their kind support for this meas-
ure.

Protective Division in Washington, D.C. where
he protected President William J. Clinton and

the Protective Intelligence Division in 2001.
Special Agent Williams was able to come
home in 2003, when he was promoted to As-
sistant Special Agent in Charge of the Bir-
mingham Field Office.
He returned to Washington, D.C. in 2005
where he served as the Assistant Special
Agent in Charge of the Presidential Protective
Division. In October 2008, he was promoted to
the Special Agent in Charge of the Columbia,
South Carolina Field Office.
In January 2013, he once again found his
way to D.C. when he was promoted into the
Senior Executive Service where he served as
the Special Agent in Charge of the Protective
Intelligence and Assessment Division. In this
capacity, he had executive oversight for pro-
tective intelligence, threat assessments and
the Secret Service behavioral analysis pro-
gram. In 2015, he was promoted to the posi-
tion of Deputy Assistant Director in the Secret
Service Office of Protective Operations. He
ensured that the President, the First Lady and
all protected persons, places and events re-
ceived the highest level of security based on
threats and vulnerabilities.
Throughout his career, Special Agent Wil-
liams has also served the community volun-
teering for a number of organizations, includ-
ing the Big Brother program, Boys/Girls Club

‘‘fish’’ mail out of blue collection boxes. Spe-
cifically, criminals use a contraption as simple
as a string connected to a sticky substance to
‘‘fish’’ out envelopes from these mailboxes,
then open the letters to steal people’s per-
sonal information such as bank, credit card,
and Social Security numbers. Tragically, this
has resulted in many incidents of identity theft
and bank fraud.
In the last year alone, there were 3,000 inci-
dents of mail fishing in New York City. These
criminals also engage in check washing to re-
write the name of the payee and/or the
amount. Many of my constituents became vic-
tims of bank fraud, some losing thousands of
dollars, as a result of having their mail fished.
That is why, in 2017, I made the push to have
the United States Postal Service retrofit all
standard mail collection boxes in Queens, NY.
Currently, 77 percent of these mailboxes in
Queens have been retrofitted. As a result, mail
fishing crimes have significantly decreased in
Queens. However, as only some mail collec-
tion boxes are retrofitted, mail fishing crime
shifts to regions without this security feature.
Madam Speaker, it is unacceptable that our
constituents cannot safely leave their mail in
the United States Postal Service mail collec-
tion boxes.
This is why I am introducing the ‘‘Keep Mail
Safe Act’’. This bill would require the Post-
master General to conduct a study on retro-
fitting all standard mail collection boxes in the
United States with narrow mail slots. Retro-
fitting all mail boxes would deter and prevent
incidents of mail fishing, ensure the security of
our constituents’ mail, and restore their trust in
utilizing the United States Postal Service.
As mail fishing incidents are on the rise, our
diligence in protecting our constituent’s mail is
more important than ever. I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation and join me
in the fight against mail fishing.

NATIONAL LOGISTICS DAY—JUNE
28TH
HON. MIKE KELLY
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to urge you to designate June
28th as National Logistics Day. For centuries,
the logistics industry has connected our world
and our nation one shipment at a time. The lo-
gistics industry is a prime example of success
not only in the United States, but also globally.
The field of logistics employs over 50 million
people around the world, 5 million of those
being proud American citizens.
This year, Logistics Plus, a flourishing com-
pany proudly founded and based in Erie,
Pennsylvania, requests that June 28th be pro-
claimed National Logistics Day. Along with
being routinely regarded as a thriving contrib-
utor in the logistics industry, Logistics Plus, a
global logistics company, has generated hun-
dreds of valuable careers in Pennsylvania’s
16th district. Since its establishment in 1996,
Logistics Plus and its founder, Jim Berlin,
have spread award-winning business solutions
to their numerous locations worldwide.
The logistics industry is a prominent model
of the success, achievement, and prosperity
that American businesses and corporations
strive for daily. Often, the current administra-
tion speaks on the importance of business and
commercial activity in the United States and
global community. Logistics Plus and the Lo-
gistics industry overall is an outstanding rep-
resentation of the continuous economic
growth, with approximately eight percent of
products made and sold in the U.S. being at-
tributed to logistics. The third-party logistics in-
dustry (3PL), which aids in business manage-
ment of supply chains, represents an $800 bil-
lion industry on its own. The national logistics
industry connects and unites the country by
aiding in the transportation of more than 13
billion tons of freight domestically by means of
roads, sea, air, and rail.
It is vital that we recognize the dedicated
professionals in the logistics industry who
unify and strengthen our world community
through safe, reliable, and affordable transpor-
tation and storage services. National Logistics
Day on June 28th serves as an annual show
of appreciation and recognition to the industry,
which has contributed to our national and
global economies. I urge this committee to en-
sure that this sign of commendation to an in-
dustry that has demonstrated the value of
hard work time and again be granted the na-
tional acknowledgement of achievement by
declaring June 28th National Logistics Day.

Queer people.
House Democrats worked together last

tion’s attempts to discriminate against the
transgender community and will continue the
fight until there is true equality. I know this

equality.

cruelty especially impact already vulnerable

GUN VIOLENCE AWARENESS
MONTH
HON. JOYCE BEATTY
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize June as Gun Violence Aware-
ness Month.
So far this year, nearly seven thousand
Americans have been killed and almost twice
as many injured at the hands of gun violence.
Even more shocking, there have been 190
mass shootings across the country—in
Shreveport, Philadelphia, Louisville, and Des
Moines just within the last week.
Gun violence is a uniquely American epi-
demic, but unfortunately, failure to act has
also been uniquely American.
Congress failed to act twenty years ago
after Columbine, again twelve years ago after
Virginia Tech, or after Sandy Hook, the Pulse
Nightclub, Las Vegas, or Parkland.
Thankfully, the new Democratic majority has
passed the first gun violence prevention bills
in a generation.
Whether it’s those bills or my SAFER Now
Act (H.R. 282), Congress must continue our
work ‘‘For the People’’ and act to prevent one
more American from falling victim to gun vio-
lence.

HONORING AMERICA’S DAIRY
FARMERS DURING NATIONAL
DAIRY MONTH
HON. JAMES R. BAIRD
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize our nation’s dairy farmers. Since
1937, the month of June has been set aside
to celebrate National Dairy Month.
The dairy industry, and the products it pro-
duces, is extremely important to the agricul-
tural sector and hundreds of millions of Ameri-
cans and consumers around the world. It gen-
erates $38 billion of direct wages for 3 million
jobs on 37,000 family-owned dairy farms and
related industries.
But times have been tough in recent years
with narrow margins and low to no profitability.
In fact, this is the fifth consecutive year that
we’ve had low prices, pushing 2,700 dairy
farmers out of business in 2018.
That’s why USDA’s Dairy Margin Coverage
Program is so important to the American dairy
industry. The Dairy Margin Coverage program
will provide farmers with better coverage for
lower premiums, including a retro-active start
which means our dairy farmers will be able to
get help with over 5 months of tough losses.
As we honor the dairy producers in our
communities this month, I encourage all of our
Hoosier dairy farmers to sign up for their pro-
gram in order to secure much needed protec-
tion during times of uncertainty. I thank them
for their tireless work for the American people.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT
SUCCESS ACT
HON. GRACE MENG
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, community
colleges play a critical role in American higher
education. There are over 1,000 community
colleges across the United States. Nearly 40
percent of undergraduates are enrolled in
community colleges. Of these students a large
portion are first-generation, low-income college
students, and half are students of color. Com-
munity colleges indeed play a crucial role in
closing our nation’s skills gap through edu-
cation and workforce training. Unfortunately,
many of these institutions are often under-
resourced. This leaves students without the
necessary support to complete their degrees.
Access to college means little without de-
gree completion. Studies show that only 20
percent of full-time community college stu-
dents graduate after three years and just 35
percent graduate after five years. Research is
also clear that students who do not complete
a degree are at greater risk of defaulting on
their loans.
That is why, today, I am introducing the
Community College Student Success Act of
2019, a bill that will help community colleges
around the country by giving under-resourced
colleges with high percentages of low-income
and minority students the necessary funding to
develop and implement comprehensive stu-
dent support services.
First, the Community College Student Suc-
cess Act would provide academic advising,
wherein, advisors will provide ongoing, aca-
demic, and personal advising to students in-
cluding helping to clearly lay out a three-year
graduation plan and creating strong transfer
pathways for students interested in continuing
their education.
Second, this bill would provide academic
and career support, wherein, students on aca-
demic probation or who have been referred to
developmental courses will be required to
meet weekly with a tutor. These students will
also meet with an on-campus career coun-
selor or participate in career services events
at least once a semester to promote career
planning and success.
Third, this bill would provide financial sup-
port, wherein, students will receive a tuition
waiver to cover the gap between the tuition
and fees and financial aid. Additionally, stu-
dents satisfying all the meeting requirements
will receive a financial incentive, such as a
transportation pass or gas card, at least once
per month.
Additionally, the goal of this legislation is to
replicate the remarkable and proven success
of the Accelerated Study in Associate Pro-
grams (ASAP)—a program that was created
and instituted by the City University of New
York (CUNY) in 2007. This program has been
found to consistently double the graduation
rates of participating students.
Madam Speaker, the Community College
Student Success Act of 2019 ultimately seeks
to help achieve student success through holis-
tic and student-centered services.
I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion and join me in helping community college
students across the nation by providing path-
ways to upward economic mobility and more
opportunities. If Congress truly values the im-
portance of educating our next generation, we
must increase our investment in these institu-
tions and the students they serve. Each per-
son deserves a quality education—no matter
their background—because education is a civil
right.

TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF MICHAEL
ERIC ENGH, S.J.
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 27, 2019
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor Michael Eric Engh, S.J., on the occa-
sion of his retirement as President of Santa
Clara University, after a decade of extraor-
dinary leadership.
Father Engh was born to Marie and Donald
Engh in Los Angeles on December 14, 1949.
He entered the Society of Jesus in 1972, and
earned his M.A. at Gonzaga University in
1976. He earned his Master of Divinity degree
from the Jesuit School of Theology, in Berke-
ley, California in 1982 and his Ph.D. at the
University of Wisconsin in 1987.
Father Engh taught at Loyola Marymount
University from 1988 to 2008, became Santa
Clara University’s 28th President on January
5, 2009, and retires from the Presidency after
a most distinguished decade on June 30,
2019.
Father Engh serves on a number of boards,
including the Board of Trustees of Boston Col-
lege; the Board of Directors of the Silicon Val-
ley Leadership Group; the Board of Directors
of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Uni-
versities; the Council of Presidents of the

Graduate Theological Union; and the Board of
Trustees of Bellarmine College Preparatory.
Since arriving at Santa Clara, Father Engh
has led the University in defining its vision and
setting the course for the future with a bold
plan, Santa Clara 2020. Under his decade of
leadership the University ’s endowment grew
to $926 million in 2019, from $515 million in
2009. The University also recorded significant
student accomplishments and accolades in-
cluding Rhodes and Fulbright Scholars.
Ten new undergraduate majors were insti-
tuted, several Masters programs were
launched, and the REAL program for summer
research in the College of Arts & Sciences
began, among many others, and the Law
School’s Intellectual Property Program was
ranked fourth by US News in 2019. During Fa-
ther Engh’s tenure the campus was beautified
and improved, and many new buildings were
opened and facilities modernized, with many
more in the process of development.
The era of Father Engh bears the impri-
matur of diversity and inclusion. He estab-
lished the Office for Diversity and Inclusion in
2013 and created the Blue Ribbon Commis-
sion on Diversity and Inclusion in 2016, in-
creasing significantly the number of students
of color from 45 percent to 51 percent.
Sustainability has been a hallmark of the
Engh presidency. He signed the Climate Neu-
trality Action Plan and established the Office
of Sustainability which grew into the Center for
Sustainability with additional staff and pro-
gramming. His efforts resulted in a deep-seat-
ed culture of sustainability across the entire
University and ingrained in the community the
importance of justice and sustainability.
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of
Representatives to join me in honoring Father
Michael Engh for his superb leadership of
Santa Clara University which is not only a
jewel in the crown of Jesuit universities but
also one of the finest institutions of higher
learning in the United States. His remarkable
decade as President has strengthened our re-
gion, our state of California and he is a great
blessing to our nation.
