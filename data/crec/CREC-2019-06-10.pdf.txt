HONORING THE SHEALY
BROTHERS
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, last week was the 75th anni-
versary of the Normandy invasion.
150,000 American, British, and Cana-
dian fighting men landed on the beach-
es of Normandy to begin the deadly
struggle to liberate Europe from Na-
zism and stop the Holocaust.
Among the heroes were five brothers
from Lexington, South Carolina. Sadly,
only four came home alive.
Carroll Floyd Shealy was killed by
mortar fire after jumping with the
101st Airborne Division.
Joe Lewis Shealy was wounded and
nearly lost his leg after jumping in
with the 82nd Airborne Division.
Muller Everett Shealy served in Nor-
mandy with the Army Air Corps.
Billy Ray Shealy and his twin broth-
er, Bobby Rhett Shealy, both served
aboard the USS Dale W. Peterson.
We owe them our deepest gratitude.
Today, congratulations to Bulgaria,
recognizing the 29th anniversary of the
first post-Communist election to im-
plement democracy.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.
FUND HHS TO PROVIDE CARE FOR
UNACCOMPANIED MINORS
(Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker,
today, I rise to highlight a humani-
tarian crisis happening within our bor-
ders.
Because of our failing immigration
policies and inadequate border secu-
rity, people, including tens of thou-
sands of unaccompanied children, are
streaming across our porous borders. In
shelters throughout the country, the
Department of Health and Human
Services is caring for over 13,000 unac-
companied migrant children who ille-
gally crossed our southern border.
This is just a portion of the over
40,000 children who have come into U.S.
custody since October of last year, and
more of these children are arriving
sicker than ever before and require im-
mediate medical attention.
Time is not on our side. To continue
caring for these children, HHS needs
more funding. HHS projects it will be
out of funds to provide care within a
matter of days.
HHS requested $3.2 billion in emer-
gency funds to continue providing shel-
ter, food, and medical care for these
children, but Democrats have ignored
this request.
It is time for us to work together to
provide the resources necessary to care
for these children, work to fix our im-
migration system, and secure our bor-
ders to prevent this crisis from hap-
pening again.

purpose of complying with the Statutory

mined by reference to the latest statement
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of
the House Budget Committee, provided that
such statement has been submitted prior to
the vote on passage.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. LEWIS) and the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. BRADY) each will con-
trol 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Georgia.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members may
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia?
There was no objection.
Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
3151, the Taxpayer First Act. Mr.
Speaker, this is not a Republican or a
Democratic bill. It is an American one.
Let me begin by thanking Chairman
NEAL, Ranking Member BRADY, the
Oversight Subcommittee Ranking
Member KELLY, and all the Members
who joined us on this bill.
I would also like to recognize Chair-
man GRASSLEY and Ranking Member
WYDEN and their staff who were our
Senate partners on this necessary ef-
fort. In particular, I would like to
thank our staff for their hard, great,
and good work.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the proc-
ess and the product. The record must
be clear: Members of the House and
Senate spent many years researching
ideas to help taxpayers. The Oversight
Subcommittee held 14 hearings and
roundtables. We reached out to tax-
payers and stakeholders. We have
asked questions and listened to the re-
sponses. We asked Democratic and Re-
publican Members to provide feedback.
We even opened a public comment pe-
riod on the draft bill. We came to-
gether. We studied, we listened, and we
respected the taxpayer.
Mr. Speaker, this has not been easy.
We worked hard to correct misinforma-
tion that this bill would tie the hands
of the IRS and hurt taxpayers’ options.
During a time when there is so much
tension and rush to judgment, our coa-
lition remained thoughtful and fair.
After the House passed this legisla-
tion earlier this year, new information
came out, and I am proud that we came
together and requested an investiga-
tion and the IRS responded quickly and
took action.
Mr. Speaker, despite every single
challenge, we remained committed to
bipartisanship and to the American
taxpayer.
I want to share a few examples of the
good this bill does. The Taxpayer First
Act authorizes $30 million in matching
grants for the Volunteer Income Tax
Assistance program which helps low-
and moderate-income taxpayers com-
plete and file their taxes. This bill also
protects certain low-income taxpayers
from the private debt collection pro-
gram. In addition, some of the most
popular parts of the bill include new
initiatives to protect and serve tax-
payers who are victims of identity
theft.
Mr. Speaker, the Taxpayer First Act
serves as an example of a good and
thoughtful policy that Congress can
produce. We took our time. We studied,
and we stayed the course. We refused
to give up, and we refused to give in.
Mr. Speaker, this bill should be an in-
spiration to us all.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the Taxpayer First
Act, and I reserve the balance of my
time.

Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN NEAL: I am writing with
respect to H.R. 3151, the ‘‘Taxpayer First Act
of 2019.’’ As a result of your having consulted
with us on provisions on which the Com-
mittee on Appropriations has a jurisdic-
tional interest, I will not request a sequen-
tial referral on this measure, an opportunity
to raise a point of order under clause 4 of
rule XXI of the Rules of the House, or fur-
ther amendment to the bill when it is consid-
ered on the House floor.
The Committee on Appropriations takes
this action with the mutual understanding
that we do not waive any jurisdiction over
the subject matter contained in this or simi-
lar legislation, we do not agree to future sus-
pension or waivers of the House rule restrict-
ing the carrying of appropriations in meas-
ures and amendments thereto, and the Com-
mittee will be appropriately consulted and
involved as the bill or other legislation car-
rying appropriations moves forward so that
we may address any issues within our juris-
diction and provisions giving rise to a point
of order—regardless of whether a measure is
similar to legislation passed by the House in
a previous Congress, or represents the prod-
uct of negotiation between parties or cham-
bers.
The Committee also reserves the right to
seek appointment of an appropriate number
of conferees to any House-Senate conference
involving this or similar legislation, and re-
quest your support for such a request.
Finally, I would appreciate your response
to this letter confirming this understanding,
and would ask that a copy of our exchange of
letters on this matter be included in the
Congressional Record during floor consider-
ation of H.R. 3151.

Hon. RICHARD E. NEAL,
Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,
Washington, DC.
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am writing con-
cerning H.R. 3151, the ‘‘Taxpayers First Act
of 2019.’’ Because you have been working
with the Committee on Financial Services
concerning provisions in the bill that fall
within our Rule X jurisdiction, I agree to
forgo formal consideration of the bill so that
it may proceed expeditiously to the House

The Committee on Financial Services

ation of H.R. 3151 with our mutual under-
standing that, by foregoing formal consider-
ation of H.R. 3151 at this time, we do not
waive any jurisdiction over the subject mat-
ter contained in this or similar legislation,
and that our Committee will be appro-
priately consulted and involved as this or

mittee also reserves the right to seek ap-
pointment of an appropriate number of con-

volving this or similar legislation and re-
quest your support for any such request.
Finally, I would appreciate your response

ation of H.R. 3151.

MAXINE WATERS,
Chairwoman.
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, this bill represents
what this body can accomplish when
we work together across the aisle. It is
true that no one gets everything they
want, but we put in the effort, we did
the hard work, and we talked to each
other, and we came together to find so-
lutions on common ground.
I am honored to have cosponsored the
Taxpayer First Act with my friend
from Georgia, Oversight Subcommittee
Chairman JOHN LEWIS. This is the fifth
time this bill will pass the House with
strong bipartisan support, and I am
proud of the House leadership—Demo-
crats and Republicans together—initi-
ated first by Mr. LEWIS and Mr. Ros-
kam of Illinois and Mr. LEWIS and Ms.
Jenkins of Kansas, and now Mr. LEWIS
and Mr. KELLY. This will be the fifth
time this passes the House, which tells
you the importance of this legislation,
Mr. Speaker.
I want to especially thank Chairman
LEWIS for his commitment to tax-
payers and for working with us on be-
half of the American people.
The IRS should be a customer service
agency that focuses on treating tax-
payers with respect and dignity. Over
the last several years, the Ways and
Means Committee held a number of bi-
partisan hearings to discover what is
working and what isn’t at the IRS. As
we crafted this legislation together to
redesign the IRS for the first time in
two decades, we focused on improving
the relationship between the taxpayer
and the agency.
We all agree the IRS should prioritize
taxpayers’ rights and they should be a
resource—not a threat—to Americans.
This bill achieves these goals.
After passage of the Taxpayer First
Act, Americans will interact with an
IRS that carries out customer service
more like our businesses, because this
bill will improve the support Ameri-
cans receive online, in person, and on
the phone.
This bill takes a number of steps to
move the IRS into the 21st century.
First, the IRS will have to come up
with a customer service plan to better
serve taxpayers because no American
should fear contacting the IRS for
help.
We also together rein in the abuses.
We are overhauling the IRS’ enforce-
ment tools so families and small busi-
nesses don’t have property unfairly
seized. The Constitution guarantees
Americans the right to due process and
protection from unreasonable searches
and seizures. In hearings led by Chair-
man LEWIS and others, we have heard
stories from across the country of the
IRS abusing these rights. Under this
bill, that stops.
Third, the Taxpayer First Act recasts
the IRS as our tax administrator rath-
er than simply an enforcement agency.
We will better protect taxpayers from
enforcement abuses by creating an
independent appeals office. This will
give taxpayers a fair and impartial re-
view of disputes they have with the
IRS. The bill also ensures taxpayers
have the same access to information as
the IRS, putting our taxpayers on a
level playing field.
We are revamping the IRS’ ancient
technology and better positioning the
agency to combat identity theft and
cyber threats. IRS employees, as hard
as they work, are currently using tech-
nology that is severely outdated. Some
of it dates back to the 1960s. This bill
requires accountability by the IRS for
the billions of dollars in funding it is
given for IT each year. That account-
ability extends to ensuring taxpayer
information is protected and is safe
from cybercriminals looking to steal
through taxpayer refunds. This bill
also strengthens the IRS’ partnership
with States and the private sector to
combat these threats.
Finally, this bill requires the IRS to
bring back to Congress the complete
restructuring of the agency focused on
these principles of taxpayer first cus-
tomer service, reining in those abuses,
and protecting our private taxpayer in-
formation, making sure there is a fair
appeals process in these disputes with
the IRS.
Taken together, these reforms will
greatly benefit Americans each year
during tax season and throughout the
year.
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R.
3151, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. HILL).
Ms. HILL of California. Mr. Speaker,
I rise in support of H.R. 3151, the Tax-
payer First Act, which is a very excit-
ing piece of legislation because who
doesn’t get excited about taxes?
However, in all seriousness, we
should get excited when paying taxes
or filing our taxes becomes easier and
better for the American people.
I am so thrilled to be here today to
offer my support, and I am beyond
grateful that my concerns with the free
file provision were heard and acted
upon.
I am beyond grateful to Congressman
LEWIS’ leadership on this legislation
which will save the government money,
protect low-income individuals, and
give the IRS resources to offer many
additional much-needed services. I also
want to thank the Congressman’s staff
and the Ways and Means Committee
staff for working with my team—who
also deserve a great deal of thanks—to
make this happen. It is an incredible
example of the collaboration that can
happen to positively affect peoples’
lives, and I cannot begin to express my
gratitude that such a long-term, well-
respected leader such as JOHN LEWIS
took my concerns into consideration
and involved me in the process, even
though I am a lowly freshman.
The fact that we were able to get this
provision resolved is showing how Con-
gress is changing and showing how we
are taking power away from corpora-
tions and special interests and back
into the hands of regular people. I am
proud to be part of that effort.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill.
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time.
In closing, this bipartisan bill puts
an emphasis on the IRS’ better serving
Americans and makes sure that it is
customer focused. It reins in the
abuses, requires the IRS to better pro-
tect our privacy, creates an inde-
pendent appeals process, makes sure
that taxpayers are put on the same
level playing field as the agency, and
requires them to bring back a complete
restructuring plan to Congress.
I am so appreciative of the work of
our Democrat colleagues and Chairman
LEWIS, especially, coming together
again today to support these reforms
to the IRS and showing our constitu-
ents that we put their interests ahead
of Washington.
Again, Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge
support of H.R. 3151, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, the Taxpayer First Act
is a bipartisan bill in both the House
and in the Senate. This bill will im-
prove the Internal Revenue Service and
help taxpayers. This is a good and nec-
essary bill.
Again, I would like to thank the
ranking member, Mr. BRADY, and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4364 June 10, 2019
thank Mr. KELLY in his absence, Chair-
man NEAL, and our staff for all of their
hard and good work on this important
bill.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to
support the Taxpayer First Act, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
strong support of H.R. 3151, the ‘‘Taxpayer
First Act of 2019.’’
H.R. 3151 aims to amend the Internal Rev-
enue Code of 1986 to modernize and improve
the Internal Revenue Service, and for other
provisions.
The bill would create an independent means
for taxpayers to appeal actions of the IRS, lim-
its the capacity of private debt collectors to
target low-income citizens, allows taxpayers to
request an identification protection PIN num-
ber to protect themselves from identity theft,
and creates a single point of contact so that
taxpayer conversations with IRS agents can
be documented and tracked.
It is critical that we amend the Internal Rev-
enue Code because we have a duty to our
constituents to improve their contact with the
Internal Revenue Service concerning appeals,
identification protection, and financial inequity.
This legislation also codifies the popular
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program
and authorizes $30 million in matching grants
for the program.
When enacted, H.R. 3151 will create a bet-
ter framework for the Internal Revenue Serv-
ice which will in turn ensure that American tax-
payers are at the forefront of our agenda.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join
me in supporting H.R. 3151 to amend the In-
ternal Revenue Code of 1986 bringing it into
the 21st century.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.
LEWIS) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3151.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Supporting

GENERAL LEAVE
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on this measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York?
There was no objection.
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 542, the Supporting Research
and Development for First Responders
Act.
Terrorism poses a serious threat to
our country, especially to the New
York City metropolitan area. Recently,
a man was arrested in New York for
plotting to use guns, grenades, and a
suicide vest to attack police officers
and innocent people in Times Square.
Given the complexity of the current
terrorism threat environment, it is
critical that we prioritize the research
and development of first responder
technologies.
That is why I introduced the Sup-
porting Research and Development for
First Responders Act. This bill would
permanently authorize the New York
City-based National Urban Security
Technology Laboratory, commonly re-
ferred to as NUSTL.
H.R. 542 directly supports first re-
sponders in New York City and across
the country by authorizing the testing
and evaluation of new technologies and
systems for counterterrorism work and
emergency response.
NUSTL is constantly developing and
testing new tools for our brave first re-
sponders to use in the event of a ter-
rorist attack, industrial accident, or
natural disaster and closely collabo-
rates with law enforcement agencies
like the FDNY, the NYPD, and the
Nassau County Police Department in
my district.
NUSTL organizes simulated sce-
narios with first responders to test new
emergency systems, sponsors research
for cutting-edge technology, and works
with first responders in the field to
evaluate and assist with new tools.
It is the only Federal lab in this
country that is focused entirely on
helping first responders carry out their
mission, wherever it may be.
In each of the last two budgets, the
Trump administration has proposed
closing down NUSTL. Fortunately,
Congress has rejected this shortsighted
move, as it would make my community
and so many others less safe and less
prepared in the face of an emergency.
Looking ahead, in addition to enact-
ing H.R. 542, Congress needs to
prioritize funding for NUSTL so that it
has the stability it needs to continue
its critical work, not just for New York
City but for urban areas in all 50
States.
I want to thank Congressman PETER
KING for co-leading this legislation,
and I thank the chair and ranking
member for their support in com-
mittee.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support this legislation, and
I reserve the balance of my time.

While the Science Committee is claiming
jurisdiction over this bill, I recognize and ap-
preciate your desire to bring this legislation
before the House in an expeditious manner,
and, accordingly agree not to insist on a se-
quential referral. This is, of course, condi-

nothing in this legislation or my decision to
forgo sequential referral waives, reduces, or
otherwise affects the jurisdiction of the
Science Committee, and that a copy of this

The Science Committee also expects that
you will support our request to be conferees

Thank you for your attention on this mat-

Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 542. This bill authorizes the Na-
tional Urban Security Technology Lab-
oratory in New York City, a one-of-its-
kind testing lab for first responders.
The NUSTL evaluates and validates
emerging technologies for use by first
responders. Their work provides valu-
able information to first responders to
increase their ability to save lives and
property as departments across the Na-
tion respond to incidents.
H.R. 542 will ensure that the National
Urban Security Technology Labora-
tory’s work will continue.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in supporting this legislation. I
urge adoption of the bill, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 542 represents a bi-
partisan effort to support the needs of
State and local first responders. It is
critical that the Federal Government
have the capacity to develop, test, and
transition the best new technologies to
the first responder community.
It bears repeating that NUSTL is the
only Federal lab in the country that is
focused entirely on helping first re-
sponders carry out their mission.
As the tactics and weapons of terror-
ists evolve, NUSTL will continue to
play a key role in ensuring that our
first responders are not just prepared
but that they remain one step ahead.
Mr. Speaker, before I close, I would
note that a similar version of this bill
passed the House in June 2018 by a
voice vote. I would ask my colleagues
to pass it again today and send it to
the Senate, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from New York (Miss
RICE) that the House suspend the rules
and pass the bill, H.R. 542.
The question was taken.

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

Nonprofit Organizations Against Ter-
rorism Act of 2019.
H.R. 2476 would authorize the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security’s Nonprofit
Security Grant Program. This impor-
tant grant program makes funding
available to nonprofit organizations
that are at risk of a terrorist attack.
Recently, nonprofit and religious or-
ganizations throughout the United
States and abroad have experienced an
alarming increase in violence and
threats of violence. This year alone has
been particularly tragic.
Consider, for example, the April 27
shooting in Poway, California, where a
gunman opened fire on congregants at
a Passover celebration.
Other such attacks include the April
21 coordinated terrorist attack on
churches and hotels in Sri Lanka that
killed nearly 250 people and injured
more than 500 others. And the March 15
shooting at a mosque in New Zealand
where 50 people were killed.
This past April, we also saw the burn-
ing of three churches in Louisiana,
which we later learned were motivated
by hate.
Unfortunately, however, targeting
houses of worship is not a new phe-
nomenon. There was the 2018 Tree of
Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh
where 11 people were killed; the 2017
shooting at a church in Sutherland
Springs, Texas, where 26 people were
killed; and the 2012 shooting at a Sikh
temple in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
These attacks amplify the dire need
that religious institutions and other
nonprofit organizations have for effec-
tive security resources. They need
these resources to keep themselves
safe.
H.R. 2476 would also allow these
grants to be made available to all at-
risk facilities, regardless of where they
are located.
The bill authorizes the program at
$75 million, with $50 million reserved
for nonprofit institutions located with-
in the UASI areas, the Urban Area Se-
curity Initiative areas, and $25 million
reserved for institutions located out-
side of UASI jurisdictions.
The goal of DHS is to keep Ameri-
cans safe across this country. This bill
is a critical part of that goal. It would
help ensure that nonprofits and places
of worship across the country are pro-
tected and that congregants have the
peace of mind they deserve.
I think we can all agree that pro-
tecting our communities from terrorist
attacks should never be a partisan
issue, and that is why the roster of 104
cosponsors for this legislation is large
and diverse, with strong representation
by Democrats and Republicans, myself
included.
The Nonprofit Security Grant Pro-
gram is one of the most sought-after
grant programs for nonprofit organiza-
tions in my district, and I am grateful
that my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle have demonstrated such strong
support for the program.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 2476, the Securing American
Nonprofit Organizations Act of 2019.
The Nonprofit Security Grant Pro-
gram provides critical funding to
harden security at houses of worship,
community centers, schools, and other
cultural institutions located in Urban
Area Security Initiative, or UASI, re-
gions.
This legislation expands the grant
program so eligible entities not within
UASI regions can also apply. These
grants are used for target-hardening
activities and physical security up-
grades as well as for necessary security
training.
The unfortunate reality is that
threats to religious institutions and
other soft targets are not going away
and, in fact, are increasing at an
alarming rate.
There have been a number of attacks,
both overseas and in the United States,
at places of worship. It is a stark re-
minder of the continued threat.
The Nonprofit Security Grant Pro-
gram assists the most at-risk organiza-
tions in hardening their defenses, while
allowing them to remain focused on
providing services and counsel in their
communities.
Mr. Speaker, I support this legisla-
tion, and I urge my colleagues to do so.
I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
as the threats to our homeland con-
tinue to evolve, we must be prepared to
face the new and emerging challenges
they present.
H.R. 2476 would authorize DHS to
continue assisting nonprofit organiza-
tions across the country with pro-
tecting their members and their build-
ings.
A version of this bill passed the
House by a voice vote in the last Con-
gress, and I hope my colleagues will do
the same again today.
H.R. 2476 was also endorsed by the
Jewish Federations of North America. I
truly appreciate their partnership and
collaboration around this critical
Homeland Security program, and I in-
clude in the RECORD their letter of sup-
port.
THE JEWISH FEDERATIONS
OF NORTH AMERICA,
May 9, 2019.
Hon. BENNIE G. THOMPSON,
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
Hon. MICHAEL DENNIS ROGERS,
Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Se-
curity,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN THOMPSON AND RANKING
MEMBER ROGERS: We commend you for
scheduling the mark-up of H.R. 2476, the ‘‘Se-
curing American Non-Profit Organizations
Against Terrorism Act of 2019’’, and respect-
fully urge Members of the Committee to sup-
port the bill.
On April 27, 2019, white supremacist John
Earnest allegedly entered the Chabad of
Poway synagogue, near San Diego, CA, dur-
ing Passover services, and murdered Lori
Kaye, 60, and attempted to murder Noya
Dahan, 8, Almog Peretz, 34, and Rabbi
Yisroel Goldstein, 57. On October 27, 2018,
white supremacist Robert D. Bowers alleg-
edly entered the Tree of Life synagogue in
Pittsburgh, PA, during Sabbath services, and
murdered 11 congregants and wounded six
others, including four police officers. In the
months between these deadly attacks, the
FBI has brought charges against would-be
terrorists and violent homegrown extremists
for plots and threats against synagogues,
Jewish community centers, mosques, Islamic
centers, and churches located in Washington,
DC, New York, California, Wisconsin, Min-
nesota, Montana, Florida, Ohio, Texas, Kan-
sas, Oregon and Pennsylvania.
Over the past year, the FBI has inves-
tigated more than 100 threats to religious in-
stitutions. As recently as January 2019, the
Federal Government released a Joint Intel-
ligence Bulletin that assesses that domestic
actors will continue to pose a lethal threat
to faith-based communities in the Homeland.
The JIB advises government counterter-
rorism and law enforcement officials and pri-
vate sector security partners responsible for
securing faith-based communities to remain
vigilant in light of the enduring threat to
faith-based communities posed by US-based
threat actors and homegrown violent ex-
tremists. The JIB also warns of the difficulty
in detecting domestic terrorists and extrem-
ists because of the individualized nature of
their radicalization to violence. (Source:
Joint Intelligence Bulletin IA–32337–19, Feb-
ruary 22, 2019)
In previous reports, the Department of
Homeland Security has found that faith-
based organizations are at particular risk of
attack because of the significant number of
people of like faith that gather together in a
single symbolic location at specified times;
the organizations typically have unre-
stricted access to their religious services and
peripheral areas such as their parking areas
and education facilities; and because these
organizations most likely have limited re-
sources for security as nonprofit institu-
tions. As ‘‘soft targets’’, DHS has further as-
sessed that these organizations are particu-
larly vulnerable to bombing, arson attack,
small arms attack, assassination and kid-
napping, and chemical/biological/radiological
attack. To counter these threats and
vulnerabilities, DHS recommends that faith-
based organizations take a number of key
protective measures against threats and to
mitigate the effects of an attack, including:
installation of target hardening equipment,
engaging in planning and preparedness ac-
tivities and the acquisition of security per-
sonnel.
Recognizing that many nonprofits do not
have the financial resources to implement
extensive security measures, the ‘‘Securing
American Non-Profit Organizations Against
Terrorism Act of 2019’’ provides critical sup-
port for security related activities to non-
profit organizations at risk of a terrorist at-
tack that are recommended by the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security. These include
support for:
Physical Security Enhancements, such as
access controls, blast proofing, surveillance,
fencing and bollards;
Security Training of employees and orga-
nization members and volunteers;
Exercises, such as those that validate
plans and procedures, evaluate capabilities,
and assess progress toward meeting capa-
bility targets;
Planning, such as the development and en-
hancement of security plans and protocols,
emergency contingency plans, or evacuation/
shelter-in-place plans; and
Contracting of Security Personnel and off-
duty police officers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4367
June 10, 2019
In consideration of the substantial threats
and attacks to nonprofit institutions by do-
mestic and foreign terrorists and violent
homegrown extremists, the vulnerability of
nonprofits to destruction, incapacitation, or
exploitation from a terrorist attack, and the
challenges nonprofits face in providing for
needed investments in target hardening and
related preparedness activities, The Jewish
Federations respectfully urges the Members
of the Committee to support the ‘‘Securing
American Non-Profit Organizations Against
Terrorism Act of 2019’’ at markup.
Sincerely,
ROBERT B. GOLDBERG,
Senior Director, Legislative Affairs.
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I strongly encourage my colleagues to
support H.R. 2476, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-
er, H.R. 2476 would, for the first time, formally
authorize the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity’s Nonprofit Security Grant Program.
This important grant program makes funding
available to nonprofit organizations that are at
risk of a terrorist attack.
Increasingly, nonprofit organizations
throughout the United States and abroad have
experienced an alarming increase in violence
and threats of violence.
In just the first six months of 2019, the level
of bloodshed in places of worship have
shocked the world.
In addition to the April 27th shooting, where
a gunman opened fire on congregants at a
Passover celebration at a California syna-
gogue, there was the April 21st coordinated
terrorist attack on churches and hotels in Sri
Lanka that killed nearly 250 people and the
March 15th live-streamed mass shooting at a
mosque in New Zealand, where 50 people
were killed.
The horror of these attacks was com-
pounded by the three church burnings in Lou-
isiana in April.
Prior to this year, there were the 2018 ‘‘Tree
of Life’’ synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh,
where 11 people were killed; the 2017 Suther-
land Springs, Texas church shooting, where
26 people were killed; and the 2012 shooting
at a Sikh Temple in Milwaukee.
These attacks amplify the need for religious
and other nonprofit organizations to have ac-
cess to resources to keep themselves safe
from bad actors.
Enactment of H.R. 2476 will help non-profits
and places of worship take steps to be safer.
I introduced this legislation to authorize $75
million in grants with Representatives PETER
KING (R–NY), MAX ROSE (D–NY), STEVE STIV-
ERS (R–OH), BILL PASCRELL (D–NJ), and TROY
BALDERSON (R–OH) in early May and, to date,
it has over 100 Democrats and Republicans.
H.R. 2476 was endorsed by The Jewish
Federations of North America.
I truly appreciate their support and commit-
ment to this vital homeland security program.
Prospects for enactment of this legislation
are good, as a bipartisan companion bill has
been introduced.
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for H.R. 2476.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
strong support of H.R. 2476, the ‘‘Securing
American Non-Profit Organizations Against
Terrorism Act of 2019.’’
H.R. 2476 reauthorizes the Department of
Homeland Security’s Nonprofit Security Grant
Program (NSGP).
The bill would fund the NSGP at $75 million
through fiscal year 2024; where $50 million
would be reserved for nonprofit institutions lo-
cated within UASI jurisdictions, and $25 million
would be reserved for nonprofit institutions lo-
cated outside of UASI jurisdictions.
This bill is caused by the recent increase in
violence and threats of violence against non-
profit institutions.
Examples of such violence against nonprofit
organizations include:
April 27—attack on the Poway synagogue
that killed 11 April 21—a coordinated terrorist
attack on churches and hotels in Sri Lanka
that killed nearly 250 people and injured more
than 500 people.
March 15—the deadly New Zealand
mosque shootings, where 5o people were
killed.
It is critical that we better understand the
seriousness of such violent crimes as they im-
pact not only the victims, but also their fami-
lies, communities, and the generations of peo-
ple to come.
This bill will allow the Nonprofit Security
Grant Program to—Target activities, including
physical security enhancement equipment, in-
spection and the screening systems.
Pay for security training relating to physical
security and cybersecurity, target hardening,
terrorism awareness, and employee aware-
ness.
Along with, any other appropriate activity, in-
cluding cybersecurity resilience activities, as
determined by the Administrator.
When enacted, H.R. 2476 will create a bet-
ter understanding on how we can manage and
prevent terrorist acts towards non-profit orga-
nizations by targeting activities and increasing
security training.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join
me in supporting H.R. 2476 to confront such
violence against nonprofit institutions, which
pose as a strong threat to the citizens of the
United States.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from New York (Miss
RICE) that the House suspend the rules
and pass the bill, H.R. 2476.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

GENERAL LEAVE
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to
include extraneous material on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York?
There was no objection.
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, every day, hackers grow
bolder, more sophisticated, and more
ambitious. In 2016, the Russian Govern-
ment carried out an unprecedented at-
tack on our election infrastructure;
and last year, the Department of
Homeland Security and FBI revealed
that the Russians were exploiting
cyber tools to target critical infra-
structure in our energy, water, avia-
tion, and commercial sectors.
Other foreign adversaries have taken
note of Russia’s activity and are simi-
larly leveraging their cyber capabili-
ties to advance their interests and un-
dermine our own. We already know
that Chinese actors have been tar-
geting American companies and even
our transportation systems with cut-
ting-edge cyberattacks. In recent
years, we have also seen an increase in
Iranian cyberattacks on banks, busi-
nesses, and government agencies.
Meanwhile, local governments across
the country, from Atlanta to Balti-
more to Albany, have been devastated
by costly and disruptive ransomware
attacks.
The only way for us to effectively
mitigate and respond to these attacks
is by leveraging the full power and ca-
pabilities of the Federal Government.
H.R. 1158, the DHS Cyber Incident
Response Teams Act of 2019, would do
just that by authorizing hunt and inci-
dent response teams.
Housed within the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency, these
teams deploy to owners and operators
of critical infrastructure after a cyber-
security incident. They provide intru-
sion analysis, identify malicious ac-
tors, analyze malicious tools, and pro-
vide mitigation assistance strategies.
They are our boots on the ground in
the event of a cybersecurity incident
and are critical to improving the cy-
bersecurity capabilities of critical in-
frastructure operators.
Additionally, H.R. 1158 authorizes
DHS to leverage private-sector capa-
bilities to address these growing and
evolving threats.
It is important that DHS use every
measure available to confront the
changing landscape of cyber threats.
Passing this bill, authored by our
former chairman of the Homeland Se-
curity Committee, MIKE MCCAUL, will
help us accomplish that mission.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support this legislation, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I rise today in support of H.R. 1158,
the DHS Cyber Incident Response
Teams Act of 2019.
H.R. 1158 authorizes cyber hunt and
incident response teams to assist oper-
ators, free of cost, to identify unau-
thorized cyber activity while pro-
moting the proper strategies to deter
future threats.
This legislation helps us stay vigi-
lant in our efforts to respond to cyber
incidents in both the public and private
sectors as threats to our digital net-
works continue to evolve.
I support this important bill, intro-
duced by my colleague, Ranking Mem-
ber MCCAUL, and I commend him for
his leadership on this issue. I urge all
Members to support this bill.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I have no more speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close after the gentleman
from Texas closes.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield
5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. MCCAUL).
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in support of my bill, H.R. 1158,
the DHS Cyber Incident Response
Teams Act of 2019. I want to thank the
gentleman from Texas for managing
this on the floor. I want to thank the
gentlewoman from New York for her
comments.
Every day, we are facing threats
from Russia, China, Iran, North Korea,
and other malicious actors trying to
hit not only our Federal Government
networks, but our private sector.
During my time as chairman of the
House Homeland Security Committee,
I prioritized ensuring that our Nation
had the capacity to respond to cyber
threats and protect our critical infra-
structure. I am proud to say that we
have made important strides in recent
years, including standing up the Cyber-
security and Infrastructure Security
Agency within DHS.
However, we must press forward with
innovative solutions to respond to a
constantly changing threat landscape.
To that end, my bill authorizes CISA’s
ability to maintain cyber incident re-
sponse teams to assist against
cyberattacks on the government and
private sector. These teams not only
help respond to cyberattacks, but also
help mitigate the potential destruction
they cause and restore damaged net-
works after.
Additionally, my bill allows for lead-
ing industry specialists to serve on
these teams with the government and
DHS to provide outside expertise. It
really provides a force multiplier, and I
think it is a very important step for-
ward in the right direction. It ensures
that we have the best and brightest
from both the public and private sector
working in unison to secure our crit-
ical infrastructure and vital national
networks.
These response teams are a force
multiplier, enhancing our cybersecu-
rity workforce and helping protect our
interconnected world. This bill is crit-
ical to keeping our digital networks
and communications systems resilient
and protected.
I would like to also thank Congress-
men LANGEVIN, RATCLIFFE, RUPPERS-
BERGER, and KATKO for joining me in
introducing this bill.
This bill actually passed the House
last Congress, and I sure hope we can
get it passed by the Senate and signed
into law, because it is urgently needed
by the Department to protect the
United States from these critical
cyberattacks.
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this
legislation.
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I urge
adoption of the bill, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
It is hard to predict the future, but
there is one thing I know: Our adver-
saries will continue to hone their hack-
ing capabilities to advance their inter-
ests and undermine ours.
Critical infrastructure owners and
operators must have access to the inci-
dent response capabilities necessary to
protect their networks. H.R. 1158,
which was approved unanimously in
committee, will help ensure that DHS
can continue to partner effectively
with the private sector to protect crit-
ical infrastructure.
Before I close, I would like to note
that a version of this bill passed the
House by a voice vote in the 115th Con-
gress. I urge my colleagues to support
H.R. 1158.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I
rise in strong support of H.R. 1158,
‘‘DHS Cyber Incident Response Teams
Act of 2019.’’
H.R. 1158 codifies DHS’ National Cy-
bersecurity and Communications Co-
ordination Center (NCCIC) Hunt and
Incident Response Teams which the
Department currently deploys to pro-
vide intrusion analysis, identify mali-
cious actors, analyze malicious tools,
and provide mitigation assistance to
entities requesting assistance after a
cybersecurity incident.
H.R. 1158 also requires the NCCIC to
submit information to Congress regard-
ing metrics for the teams, at the end of
the first four years after enactment.
In 2017, a malware named NotPetya
was released from the hacked servers of
a Ukrainian software firm servicing a
management program used by some of
world’s largest corporations, causing
an estimated $10 billion in damage.
When this bill passes, it will assess
and mitigate situations of
cyberterrorism that undermine our na-
tion’s security and civil liberties such
as our national elections.

Due to the vulnerability of corpora-
tions’ operations, we need extensive
measures to identify, analyze, and al-
leviate threats of cyberattacks.
Affected asset owners and operators
will receive critical information to im-
prove their overall network and con-
trol systems security to lower cyberse-
curity risks, and other recommenda-
tions.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in supporting H.R. 1158 to pro-
tect our nation from malicious at-
tempts of cyberterrorism that strategi-
cally weaken our democracy.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from New York (Miss
RICE) that the House suspend the rules
and pass the bill, H.R. 1158, as amend-
ed.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as
amended, was passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

Homeland Security to locations with
participating State, local, and regional
fusion centers in jurisdictions with a
high-risk surface transportation asset
in order to enhance the security of
such assets, including by improving
timely sharing of classified informa-
tion regarding terrorist and other
threats, and for other purposes.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

GENERAL LEAVE
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to
include extraneous material on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York?
There was no objection.
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
2539, the Strengthening Local Trans-
portation Security Capabilities Act of
2019.
Every day, tens of millions of Ameri-
cans rely on our Nation’s vast trans-
portation surface system. Securing
that system must remain one of our
top national security priorities.
H.R. 2539 will help bolster situational
awareness about threats to these vital
systems by requiring DHS to prioritize
the assignment of officers and intel-
ligence analysts to State, local, and re-
gional fusion centers located in areas
with high-risk surface transportation
assets.
Further, H.R. 2539 authorizes a train-
ing program to enhance the effective-
ness of law enforcement agencies that
protect surface transportation assets.
I would like to thank my colleague,
Ms. BARRAGÁN, for introducing this im-
portant bill. I urge my House col-
leagues to support H.R. 2539.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I rise today in support of H.R. 2539,
the Strengthening Local Transpor-
tation Security Capabilities Act of
2019. This bill will provide important
support to surface transportation secu-
rity at a time when our transportation
sector faces evolving threats.
This bill ensures that the Secretary
of Homeland Security will prioritize
the assignment of intelligence analysts
to fusion centers in areas with high-
risk surface transportation assets to
bolster security, improve coordination,
and enhance information sharing.
This bill underscores the critically
important work of State, local, and re-
gional fusion centers in protecting the
homeland. These centers analyze cur-
rent threats and push critical threat
information to the front lines.
It is important that Congress pass
bills like this to strengthen the rela-
tionships among Federal, State, and
local jurisdictions so that relevant
threat information reaches the right
people in a timely manner.
I am pleased by the support of my
Democratic colleagues for fusion cen-
ters and hope this will lead to quick

H4370 June 10, 2019
passage of another bill, introduced by
Homeland Security Committee Rank-
ing Member ROGERS, H.R. 480, the
Homeland Threat Assessment Act.
Keeping transportation systems se-
cure is part and parcel to protecting
the American way of life and keeping
America moving forward. I commend
this legislation for raising the baseline
on how the Department of Homeland
Security supports the security of sur-
face transportation systems, and I urge
my colleagues to support this bill.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I have no more speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close after the gentleman
from Texas closes.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I urge
adoption of the bill, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
H.R. 2539 would be an important step
toward securing some of our country’s
most important transportation sys-
tems.
DHS is faced with an enormous chal-
lenge of combating the constantly
evolving threats facing our Nation’s
transportation systems. Timely infor-
mation sharing about these systems is
essential to counter any threat.
Last Congress, a similar measure
passed the House with wide bipartisan
support. I urge my colleagues to join
me in supporting this important legis-
lation.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Ms. BARRAGÁN. Mr. Speaker, terrorists
continue to pose a significant threat to trans-
portation systems.
Since 9/11, Congress has supported efforts
to strengthen the security of our transportation
systems.
Working with the private sector and state
and local governments, we have invested sub-
stantial resources to prevent attacks and im-
prove our intelligence around potential threats.
Still, terrorists continue to probe critical
infrastructure- looking for ‘‘soft targets’’ to at-
tack.
Worldwide, increasingly, terrorist have
turned their attention to mass transit systems,
bus stations, and freight and passenger rail
systems.
In America, surface transportation systems
transport millions of passengers and tons of
freight every day.
In my district, my constituents rely on L.A.
Metro rail and bus systems to get them to
their offices, doctor’s appointments, places of
worship, and homes every day.
According to L.A. Metro Monthly Ridership
stats, over 31 million riders travel by bus or
rail each month.
Due to the high accessibility of transit sys-
tems, protecting passengers and personnel is
difficult.
Law enforcement agencies rely on credible,
timely intelligence to keep systems secure.
My bill seeks to enhance security in two key
ways.
First, it requires DHS to prioritize the assign-
ment of officers and intelligence analysts to
State, local, and regional fusion centers areas
with a high-risk surface transportation asset.
Such deployments would help ensure that
intelligence relating to threats is shared with
appropriate stakeholders in a timely manner,
improving the chances of preventing the next
attack.
Second, my bill authorizes DHS to develop
a training program to enhance the protection,
preparedness, and response capabilities of
law enforcement agencies that operate at sur-
face transportation assets.
Surface transportation systems are unique
in their layouts and use, and training tailored
to the uniqueness of these systems would
help improve law enforcement capabilities.
This transportation security bill is supported
on a bipartisan basis and, when it was consid-
ered last month in the Committee on Home-
land Security, was approved unanimously.
As such, I strongly urge my colleagues to
support this bill.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from New York (Miss
RICE) that the House suspend the rules
and pass the bill, H.R. 2539.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker,
on that I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

There was no objection.
b 1545
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.
2083, the Homeland Procurement Re-
form Act, or HOPR.
I am proud to have introduced this
bipartisan legislation to reform the
way the Department of Homeland Se-
curity procures uniforms and protec-
tive equipment for its personnel. The
aim is to improve the quality of uni-
forms and equipment issued to Depart-
ment frontline personnel by encour-
aging the procurement of domestically
sourced uniform items.
Today, DHS has more than 60,000 uni-
formed men and women. Less than half
of those uniforms are made here in the
United States. Under this legislation,
at least a third of DHS funds spent on
uniforms are to be used to purchase
goods manufactured by American small
businesses.
Mr. Speaker, my bill is good for
homeland security, and it is good for
small American businesses.
Additionally, in response to concerns
expressed by frontline personnel about
how quickly they exhaust their annual
uniform allowances, my bill directs the
Secretary of Homeland Security to
take a hard look at the adequacy of the
allowances. In studying the issue, the
Secretary is required to determine
what improvements can be made to the
current allowances and what impacts
the current allowances have had on
employee morale and retention.
H.R. 2083 is endorsed by the Warrior
Protection and Readiness Coalition and
the National Border Patrol Council,
and it passed out of committee unani-
mously.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues
on the Homeland Security Committee
and Representative MAST from Florida
for their contributions to and support
of this legislation.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support this legislation, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself as much time as I may con-
sume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2083.
This bill will encourage the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security to pur-
chase uniforms and protective gear for
its law enforcement officers from eth-
ical manufacturers and sellers. To do
business with DHS, contractors that
supply frontline operational compo-
nents must abide by the code of busi-
ness ethics, the Federal Acquisition
Regulation, and any quality control
standards deemed appropriate by the
Secretary. These conditions will ensure
that we are purchasing the very best
products for our men and women on
the front lines.
The bill also protects the security of
DHS law enforcement personnel by re-
quiring that uniforms and equipment
that bear a law enforcement insignia
be properly stored and disposed of if
they are unusable. This will help pre-
vent law enforcement badges and
patches from falling into the wrong
hands or being used for nefarious pur-
poses.
H.R. 2083 will also help to promote
small businesses by encouraging the
Secretary of DHS to utilize small busi-
nesses for at least one-third of DHS
uniform needs. Small businesses are
the backbone of America, and this bill
will help to ensure that the Secretary
considers them for the agency’s needs
whenever possible.
H.R. 2083 requires that the Secretary
purchase uniforms at a fair and reason-
able price.
Further, the bill requires a study on
the adequacy of uniform allowances to
ensure that DHS law enforcement per-
sonnel do not have to pay out of pocket
for the basic items they need to carry
out their duties.
Mr. Speaker, this bill goes a long way
toward improving the process for pro-
curement of uniforms for DHS per-
sonnel, and I urge my colleagues to
support it.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, in addition to the goal
of ensuring that at least a third of all
uniforms and protective equipment is
provided by American small businesses,
this bill also addresses concerns ex-
pressed by DHS frontline personnel.
Component personnel often deplete
their annual uniform allowances before
the conclusion of the year and have ex-
perienced delays in receiving basic uni-
form items, such as duty shirts, belts,
and socks. H.R. 2083 would put DHS on
a path to improving its processes and
delivery of uniform items for its vital
frontline personnel.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud of this bi-
partisan legislation that will ensure
that the men and women protecting
our Nation have the best equipment
that they can.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues
for their support of this process, and
once again, I ask for their support.

H4372 June 10, 2019
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
strong support of H.R. 2083, the ‘‘Homeland
Procurement Reform Act.’’
H.R. 2083 would reform the . way the De-
partment of Homeland Security procures uni-
forms and items related to national security in-
terests.
This bill seeks to encourage the procure-
ment of domestically sourced uniform items to
ensure higher-quality uniforms and equipment
are issued to the Department.
Specifically, this bill would allocate that no
less than one-third of the funds obligated for
uniforms and protective equipment are used
for items that are manufactured in part or pro-
vided in the United States by entities that
qualify as a U.S. small business.
Additionally, H.R. 2083 will ensure that uni-
forms and protective equipment are purchased
at fair and reasonable prices, and that uniform
allowances provided to Department frontline
personnel are adequate.
Last, the bill mandates that suppliers—
store such covered item in a locked area;
report any pilferage or theft of such covered
item occurring at any stage before delivery of
such covered item; and
destroy any defective or unusable covered
item bearing official DHS insignia not manu-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
California (Mr. CORREA) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. CRENSHAW)
each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days to revise
and extend their remarks and to in-
clude extraneous materials on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, every year, the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security invests bil-
lions of dollars on major acquisition
programs to execute its critical mis-
sions. It acquires systems vital to
homeland security, including ships for
the U.S. Coast Guard and baggage
screening systems for the Transpor-
tation Security Administration.
However, DHS’ acquisition activities
are on the Government Accountability
Office’s ‘‘High Risk List’’ because of
management and funding concerns. In
fact, according to GAO, only 10 of the
24 major acquisition programs have ap-
proved schedule and cost goals and are
on track to meet those goals.
Given these challenges, it is critical
that DHS review its major acquisition
programs for proper management,
oversight, and accountability.
This bill, the DHS Acquisition Re-
view Board Act of 2019, seeks to
strengthen the role of the Acquisition
Review Board, or ARB, to improve ac-
quisition outcomes within the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security. The ARB
has the potential to help ensure that
DHS does not pursue programs that it
can’t afford or that do not meet estab-
lished cost, schedule, and performance
thresholds.
Mr. Speaker, the enactment of H.R.
2609 is one mechanism within the De-
partment to help ensure that programs
are on time, on budget, and in line with
the Department’s mission.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support this legislation, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of my bill, H.R. 2609, the DHS Acquisi-
tion Review Board Act of 2019.
The Government Accountability Of-
fice and the Department of Homeland
Security Office of Inspector General
have both identified weaknesses in the
Department’s management of its major
acquisition programs. Poor manage-
ment of these programs costs the De-
partment billions of dollars each year.
GAO has placed DHS management
functions, including acquisition man-
agement, on its ‘‘High Risk List,’’ pro-
grams that are highly susceptible to
fraud, waste, abuse, or mismanagement
or are in need of transformation.
The Department struggles to ensure
that major acquisitions are delivered
on schedule, provide the capabilities
needed, and do not exceed budget. In
recent years, GAO has identified 9 out
of 26 major acquisition programs that
experienced cost growth or schedule
slips. Cost overruns totaled $988 mil-
lion, and schedules frequently slipped
by an average of 6 months.
GAO also determined that approxi-
mately half of major acquisition pro-
grams deployed capabilities before all
key performance parameters had been
met.
It is essential that DHS establish
better management tools to provide ac-
countability in its major acquisition
programs and ensure that problems are
identified and addressed early.
My bill requires DHS to establish
mechanisms for accountability to bet-
ter manage components’ major acquisi-
tion programs by establishing an Ac-
quisition Review Board within DHS.
The board would oversee DHS’ acquisi-
tion process, review major acquisition
programs, and evaluate the use of best
practices.
The Under Secretary for Manage-
ment will serve as the chair of the
board, and the board would be required
to meet regularly. The board would be
responsible for determining if a pro-
posed acquisition has met planning re-
quirements necessary to move into the
production and deployment phases.
It would also oversee a major acquisi-
tions business strategy. The board will
review the cost tradeoffs, schedules,
and performance objectives of the pro-
grams.
As we seek to ensure the homeland is
protected and DHS has the resources it
needs to do its job, we must also ensure
that taxpayer dollars are being spent
efficiently and effectively.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support H.R. 2609, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I thank
my colleague from Texas for that fine
piece of legislation.
Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak-
ers, and I am prepared to close after
the gentleman from the State of Texas
(Mr. CRENSHAW) closes.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I urge
adoption of the bill, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2609
has the potential of fostering account-
ability and uniformity within the De-
partment’s acquisition programs.
A version of this legislation was
passed by the House by a voice vote in
the 115th Congress, and I urge my col-
leagues to do the same again today.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from California (Mr.
CORREA) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2609.
The question was taken.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, on that I
demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

California (Mr. CORREA) and the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. KATKO)
each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days to revise
and extend their remarks and to in-
clude extraneous materials on this
measure.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 2590, the DHS Overseas Per-
sonnel Enhancement Act of 2019.
A key feature of how the Department
of Homeland Security carries out its
border security mission is the deploy-
ment of personnel abroad to help en-
sure that threats are identified and ad-
dressed before they ever reach our bor-
ders.
For our part, Congress has a role to
play to ensure the Department has the
right policies and resources to keep
Americans safe, both at home and
abroad.
H.R. 2590 builds on the existing Fed-
eral mandate that requires DHS to
have a 3-year strategic plan for over-
seas deployment of DHS personnel. The
mandate enacted in 2017 was authored
by the chairman of the Committee of
Homeland Security, Representative
THOMPSON.
H.R. 2590 would strengthen the stra-
tegic plan by requiring DHS to provide
regular congressional briefings about
overseas personnel. Following the first
briefings, DHS would be required to
submit a strategic plan to enhance the
effectiveness of its overseas personnel
deployments to Congress.
Subsequent briefings would track
DHS efforts to enhance the effective-
ness of its personnel in foreign loca-
tions.
b 1600
During committee markup of this
bill, Democrats offered amendments to
ensure that DHS prioritizes efforts to
mitigate the risks and counterintel-
ligence threats facing DHS personnel
living overseas. As amended, it re-
quires DHS to report on foreign efforts
to influence our personnel and main-
tain practices to guard against these
threats, including counterintelligence
and cyber threats.
Pushing our borders out to mitigate
threats to the homeland before they
ever reach our shores is an important
endeavor and one we should all sup-
port. Providing the basic information
in H.R. 2590 will help Congress better
understand who DHS is deploying over-
seas and to what end and how we can
best support components with overseas
missions.
I would note that DHS has yet to pro-
vide Congress with a 3-year strategy
required by statute and requested by
Chairman THOMPSON years ago. I hope
that we do not have to wait much
longer before receiving this strategy
and additional information about how
DHS is using its workforce overseas.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support this legislation, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong
support of H.R. 2590, the Department of
Homeland Security Overseas Personnel
Enhancement Act of 2019. This bipar-
tisan legislation will ensure the De-
partment of Homeland Security devel-
ops personnel overseas in a strategic,
effective, and efficient manner that
will address threats before they reach
the United States shores, while im-
proving our relationships with foreign
partners.
The United States Government posi-
tions many personnel from across the
Federal Government overseas to liaise
with their foreign counterparts,
strengthen relationships, and build ca-
pacity with them. The Department of
Homeland Security does this to sup-
port its critical counterterrorism mis-
sion.
H.R. 2590 will ensure that personnel
deployed by Homeland Security over-
seas receive adequate training and mis-
sion support, while having their impor-
tant perspectives heard by their col-
leagues back in the United States.
Moreover, this bill addresses the im-
portance of foreign-based Homeland
Security personnel to effectively co-
ordinate with other Federal partners,
such as the FBI, in support of the De-
partment’s counterterror missions.
We face an ever-changing threat
landscape which presents new chal-
lenges to securing air travel, public
spaces, surface transportation, and
critical infrastructure from terror at-
tacks. It is imperative that we work
together with foreign partners to share
information, build capacity, and learn
from each other to respond to a dy-
namic threat environment, much the
same as I did for many years on State,
local, and Federal gang task forces.
I thank Representative WATSON
COLEMAN for cosponsoring this impor-
tant legislation, as well as Ranking
Member ROGERS and Chairman THOMP-
SON for their support of this measure. I
also want to thank my good friend
from California (Mr. CORREA), who is
handling the bill on the Democratic
side.

f
ANNUAL CONGRESSIONAL SOCCER
MATCH RAISES MONEY FOR
YOUTH SOCCER
(Mr. LARSEN of Washington asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute.)
Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Madam
Speaker, a few weeks ago, Democrats
and Republicans engaged in the annual
Congressional Soccer Match, and we
are taking a very brief amount of time
here to announce the outcome of that
Congressional Soccer Match. In a few
moments, I will recognize my Rep-
resentative friend from Nebraska.
This is an important timing of this
particular recognition because tomor-
row the U.S. Women’s national team
kicks off at 3 p.m. to defend their
World Cup title. For those in the Pa-
cific Northwest, that is noon. I am en-
couraging everyone to watch that
game if it is possible.
So we are here to recognize the Wom-
en’s national team, but also to recog-
nize the winners of this year’s Congres-
sional Soccer Match, the Republicans.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON).
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate Mr. LARSEN’s team spirit,
good sportsmanship here, and good
cheer.
Again, I just want to thank Mr. LAR-
SEN, Ms. CASTOR, and also Mr. LAHOOD.
We are the co-chairs of the Soccer Cau-
cus here in the Congress. I really loved
working with the other three here.
I also appreciate the good sportsman-
ship here. We stuck out a good victory
despite the heroics on your side,
Madam Speaker. But we gave it all.
Some of these great new players on our
side really did the heavy lifting.
I want to thank the U.S. Soccer
Foundation for putting this together
and for their great fundraising. The im-
portant thing is the U.S. Soccer Foun-
dation raised tremendous amounts of
money for youth soccer.
That is what we want to do. We want
to make youth soccer more prevalent

and more readily accessible for all our
youth. It teaches teamwork, and it is
good for physical conditioning. You
learn about following the rules and
taking orders from the coach. It is
great for growing up and learning how
to be a more responsible adult.
So it is a great team that put this to-
gether.
I appreciate all the Members who
played. We also appreciate the staff
members as well as some of the profes-
sionals who came out to help bring in
more people.
We worked together as a team to
bring the World Cup to North America
here in the future. We are proud of
that.
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. LARSEN
for being a great teammate.
Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Madam
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman
from Florida (Ms. CASTOR), who is also
on our team and the other co-chair.
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam
Speaker, after a number of years of
consecutive blue team victories, I am
here to congratulate the red team and
my good friends Congressman LAHOOD
and Congressman BACON, the co-chairs
of the Congressional Soccer Caucus.
Truly, the real winners are the kids
across America, who we are able to
raise charity funds for, to help make
sure that they can all experience a
beautiful game, the beautiful game of
soccer.
The U.S. Soccer Foundation funds
fields and equipment all across the
country, particularly in the under-
served areas.
Madam Speaker, I invite everyone to
join the soccer caucus and help stand
up for your kids back home.
I do have to say, on the eve of the
Women’s World Cup, with the defend-
ing World Cup champions, the U.S.
Women’s National Team, there is a lit-
tle bit of girl power not only here in
the House, but we intend to repeat the
win of the Women’s World Cup.
Let’s cheer them on and cheer on
what they have done in standing up for
pay equity and equal treatment as role
models for girls and young women all
across this country.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION
Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I regret-

2019, due to previously planned travel that
prevented me from being in Washington. Had
I been present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on
rollcall No. 242, ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 243, and
‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 244.

The Clerk read the title of the joint

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

There was no objection.
The text of the joint resolution is as
follows:
H.J. RES. 60
Whereas Congress enacted the Act of Au-
gust 12, 1946 (60 Stat. 997; ch. 955, 1), to estab-
lish a National Air Museum, later known as
the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space
Museum (NASM), to commemorate and me-
morialize the American story of human
flight in the atmosphere and in outer space;
Whereas Congress enacted the Act of July
29, 1958 (commonly known as the National
Aeronautics and Space Act) (72 Stat. 426-438;
42 U.S.C. 2451 et seq.), to declare a policy of
peaceful space activities designed for the
benefit of humankind and to establish the
National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion (NASA);
Whereas in July of 1960, NASA announced
the creation of the Apollo Program, the Na-
tion’s first orchestrated initiative to ferry
humankind out of Earth’s orbit and to the
Moon;
Whereas on July 20, 1969, the Apollo 11 Mis-
sion succeeded in landing the spacecraft
Eagle on the surface of the Moon, piloted by
two American astronauts, the first humans
to ever make landfall on another celestial
body;
Whereas on July 20 and 21, 1969, those
brave Americans became the first humans to
set foot on the surface of the Moon, forever
changing Earth’s relationship with the heav-
ens;
Whereas this momentous event was
watched in wonder by hundreds of millions of
people back on Earth, including the hun-
dreds of thousands of NASA civilian and
military staff and partners who made the
Apollo Program possible;
Whereas the Apollo Program continued
through December of 1972 and spurred the
greatest development of human scientific
and technological understanding of any dec-
ade to that point, leading to advances in
rocketry, spaceflight, avionics, tele-
communications, and computers, on which
the American public still relies today;
Whereas the National Air and Space Mu-
seum opened on the American Bicentennial
in July 1976 as a birthday gift to the country
in celebration of the Nation’s highest
achievements, under the leadership and vi-
sion of Museum Director, NASA astronaut,
and Apollo 11 Command Module Pilot Mi-
chael Collins;
Whereas NASA continues to pursue space
exploration on behalf of the American people
to increase humankind’s understanding of
the heavens; and
Whereas the National Air and Space Mu-
seum continues to memorialize the history
of American discovery and invention, and
seeks to educate and inspire new generations
of innovators and explorers to ensure that
our future achievements in space are fully
empowered by the achievements of the past:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled, That Congress—
(1) requests the Secretary of the Interior to
authorize unique and one-time arrangements
for the display of NASA and Smithsonian ar-
tifacts, digital content, film footage, and as-
sociated historic audio and imagery, in and
around the vicinity of the National Mall, in-
cluding projected onto the surface of the
Washington Monument for five nights of
public display during the period beginning on
July 16, 2019 and ending on July 20, 2019; and
(2) respectfully requests that the Clerk of
the House of Representatives transmit an en-
rolled copy of this resolution to the Sec-
retary of the Smithsonian Institution and
Director of the National Air and Space Mu-
seum.
The joint resolution was ordered to
be engrossed and read a third time, was

motion to reconsider was laid on the

EXPRESSING CONCERN FOR THE
UNITED STATES-TURKEY ALLI-
ANCE
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I move
to suspend the rules and agree to the
resolution (H. Res. 372) expressing con-
cern for the United States-Turkey alli-
ance.
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion.
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 372
Whereas the United States and Turkey
have been treaty allies since 1952, when Tur-
key became a member of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO);
Whereas the United States and Turkey are
treaty bound to safeguard the principles of
democracy, individual liberty, and the rule
of law, as well as to unite their efforts for
collective defense and the preservation of
peace and security;
Whereas Turkey is in a unique geostrategic
position on NATO’s southeastern flank, at
the confluence of Europe, Russia, the Middle
East, and the Caucasus;
Whereas Turkey is a critical NATO ally
and important military partner for the
United States, contributing to key NATO
and United States missions and providing
support for United States military oper-
ations and logistics needs;
Whereas Turkey permits United States
military access to Turkish territorial
waters, airspace, and base and port facilities,
and hosts over 2,000 members of the United
States Armed Forces, air defense equipment,
and other equipment necessary to conduct
global operations and power projection;
Whereas Turkey is a key player in the
long-term strategic competition Western al-
lies face with revisionist powers such as Rus-
sia and China;
Whereas despite the fact that Turkey
shares key regional interests with the
United States, its cooperation with Russia
and Iran, its military occupation of northern
Cyprus, its rollback of democratic norms and
institutions, including attacks on the free
press, and its continued unjust detention of
United States citizens and locally employed
United States Embassy staff is deeply prob-
lematic for the United States-Turkey rela-
tionship;
Whereas the United States recognizes that
Turkey perceives growing regional security

threats from aircraft and ballistic missiles
and sees an urgent need for a new air and
missile defense system;
Whereas Turkey announced an agreement
to acquire the S–400 air and missile defense
system from Russia in July 2017 and has pub-
licly stated it could take delivery as early as
July 2019;
Whereas section 231 of the Countering
America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions
Act of 2017 (CAATSA) requires the President
to impose sanctions on any individual or en-
tity that engages in a significant transaction
with the Russian defense or intelligence sec-
tor;
Whereas the United States Government
has developed an attractive alternative offer
to provide Turkey with a strong, capable,
NATO-interoperable air and missile defense
system that meets Turkey’s defense require-
ments;
Whereas Turkey’s planned acquisition of
the Russian-made S–400 undermines the se-
curity of the United States and NATO allies,
weakens the United States-Turkey relation-
ship, and is incompatible with Turkey’s plan
to operate the F–35 Joint Strike Fighter and
participate in F–35 production;
Whereas the F–35 Joint Strike Fighter pro-
gram is the world’s leading 5th generation
fighter aircraft program with more than a
trillion dollars in investment among United
States and international partners;
Whereas Turkey has been a critical partner
in the F–35 Joint Strike Fighter program
since 2002, with significant industrial partici-
pation, including manufacturing of certain
F–35 components, plans to host a mainte-
nance facility for regional F–35 operators, in-
vestments of more than $1.25 billion in the
program, and plans to procure 100 F–35As;
and
Whereas in addition to the F–35 Joint
Strike Fighter, Turkish defense acquisition
programs that could be affected by sanctions
include the Patriot air and missile defense
system, CH–47F Chinook heavy lift heli-
copter, UH–60 Black Hawk utility helicopter,
and F–16 Fighting Falcon aircraft: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives—
(1) fully supports the United States Gov-
ernment’s January 2019 offer to sell the Pa-
triot air and missile defense systems to Tur-
key, with the condition that Turkey not ac-
quire the S–400 air and missile defense sys-
tem from Russia;
(2) condemns the Government of Turkey’s
stated decision to acquire the Russian S–400
air and missile defense system, which would
endanger the integrity of the United States-
Turkey alliance and undermine NATO;
(3) calls for terminating Turkey’s partici-
pation in the F–35 industrial program and de-
livery of F–35 aircraft to Turkey if Turkey
acquires the Russian S–400 air and missile
defense system;
(4) declares that Turkish acquisition of the
Russian S–400 air and missile defense system
would constitute a significant transaction
within the meaning of section 231 of the
Countering America’s Adversaries Through
Sanctions Act of 2017 (22 U.S.C. 9525);
(5) calls for full implementation of sanc-
tions under the Countering America’s Adver-
saries Through Sanctions Act of 2017 if Tur-
key acquires the Russian S–400 air and mis-
sile defense system; and
(6) calls on the Government of Turkey to
cancel the acquisition of the Russian S–400
air and missile defense system.

ant to the rule, the gentleman from

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res.
372.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I am pleased to rise in strong support
of this measure to address the devel-
oping situation with Turkey. I want to
thank my colleagues who joined me to
introduce this legislation; first and
foremost, Ranking Member MCCAUL,
Leader HOYER, Minority Leader
MCCARTHY, Chairwoman LOWEY, Rank-
ing Member GRANGER, Chairman NAD-
LER and Ranking Member COLLINS.
Madam Speaker, Turkey is a NATO
ally and a nation with which we have
had a long history of friendship and
partnership. But I am deeply troubled
by the direction that President
Erdogan is taking his country.
During his time in office, we have
watched as Erdogan has turned Turkey
into an authoritarian state, attacking
the democratic values that our two na-
tions had shared for many years. He
has cracked down on the freedom of the
press, thrown innocent people in jail
for voicing opposition, and consoli-
dated his grip on power at the expense
of Turkey’s democratic institutions.
And his troubling behavior doesn’t
stop there. Erdogan is cozying up to
Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, put-
ting the security interests of the
United States and the NATO alliance
at risk.
Turkey’s plan to acquire the Russian
S–400 air defense system would threat-
en American security and do lasting
damage to our historic bilateral rela-
tionship. It simply cannot happen, es-
pecially while Turkey is still a U.S.
and NATO ally participating in the F–
35 program and hoping to acquire these
planes.
Today’s resolution gets at this very
issue. If Turkey wants to continue as a
NATO ally and U.S. partner, it must
commit to upholding our shared inter-
ests. And if Turkey decides to follow
through on its plan to acquire the Rus-
sian S–400, then they must not be able
to get American F–35s; they must not
participate in the F–35 program; and
they must face the consequences of
their decision.
And it is not that the United States
is unable to comprehend Turkey’s need
for air defense. In fact, we have offered
the Patriot anti-aircraft/anti-missile
defense system, the top of the line in
our inventory. That offer remains on
the table.
We rarely see it in foreign affairs, but
this is simply a black-and-white issue.
There is no middle ground. Either Mr.
Erdogan cancels the Russian deal, or
he doesn’t. And there is no future for
Turkey having both Russian weapons
and American F–35s.
There is no third option. There is no
path for mitigation that will allow
Turkey to have its cake and eat it too.
We cannot risk exposing our national-
security technology to Russia.
There is no partisan divide on this
issue. The State Department, the De-
fense Department, the Treasury, even
Vice President PENCE have all been
raising the alarm and urging President
Erdogan to cancel the sale. I hope
President Trump listens to his advisers
and makes sure Turkey’s leaders un-
derstand the consequences of their ac-
tions.
And the consequences are serious. If
Turkey follows through with the acqui-
sition of the S–400, it would trigger
sanctions that Congress overwhelm-
ingly, bipartisanly passed 2 years ago.
It is critical that Turkey knows that
the United States will use these tools if
the situation arises.
In the meantime, it is important that
we pass this measure and send a clear
message: The United States will not sit
by as Erdogan turns Turkey into an au-
thoritarian state aligned with our ad-
versary Russia.
Let me say that again. It is impor-
tant that we pass this measure and
send a clear message: The United
States will not sit idly by as Erdogan
turns Turkey into an authoritarian
state aligned with our adversary Rus-
sia.
So I am pleased to support this.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of this resolution that Chairman
ENGEL and I introduced because of our
serious concerns regarding the United
States-Turkey alliance.
Turkey has been a member of NATO
for almost 70 years. Through our bilat-
eral and multilateral relationship, we
have worked together to advance our
shared objectives.
However, I am deeply disturbed and
concerned that our relationship is in-
creasingly characterized by bumps in
the road. And right now, we are all
watching as Turkey stands at a fork in
the road.
This summer, Turkey is scheduled to
obtain the Russian S–400 defense sys-
tem. Purchasing the S–400 would have
unavoidable negative consequences for
U.S.-Turkey relations.
By law, the purchase would trigger
congressionally-mandated sanctions
under the Countering America’s Adver-
saries Through Sanctions law. The pur-
chase also puts at risk Turkish partici-
pation in the F–35 Joint Strike Fighter

Program and broader security coopera-
tion, including future U.S. arms sales.
The F–35 program promotes NATO
interoperability. And Turkey’s decision
to complete the purchase of the S–400
would erode its partnership in this
multilateral alliance.
While we are deeply, deeply con-
cerned about our alliance with Turkey,
we very much want to rehabilitate our
relationship. Both sides of a bilateral
partnership need to take steps toward
strengthening and preserving it. That
is why this resolution expresses full
support for the United States Govern-
ment’s offer to sell Turkey the Patriot
system if Turkey does not acquire the
S–400. We want to give Turkey the abil-
ity to accommodate its security needs
without endangering its place in
NATO.
So Turkey really has a clear binary
choice between buying Russian S–400s
and the U.S. offer to accelerate the de-
livery of Patriot missiles.
So I call upon Turkey to now step
forward and choose the United States
and NATO over Russia.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I don’t
have any speakers on this side. I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS).
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in strong support of H.R. 372,
Expressing Concern for the United
States-Turkey Alliance.
Turkey has failed in its basic NATO
responsibility to safeguard the freedom
and security of NATO allies, both po-
litically, and militarily. Turkey has
bullied and continues to bully the U.S.
and NATO allies around the world, in
particular, Greece and Cyprus.
Meanwhile, Turkey has grown ever
closer in diplomatic and military ties
to the authoritarian regimes of Russia
and Iran, sowing international insta-
bility, especially in the Eastern Medi-
terranean, Madam Speaker, which is
why I joined my colleagues in intro-
ducing H.R. 91, to reaffirm the robust
commitment of the House of Rep-
resentatives to the importance of the
United States, Israel, Greece, and Cy-
prus partnership.
The Russian S–400 missile defense
system is in no way interoperable with
NATO’s defense systems and represents
a dangerous vulnerability to the F–35
program in the event an S–400 system
user learns how to target lock F–35s
and shares that knowledge with other
international bad actors. We can’t take
that chance.
Rewarding an international bad actor
with F–35s, one of the most sophisti-
cated articles of U.S. military tech-
nology, while they imprison and or-
chestrate brazen acts of violence
against U.S. citizens, threaten U.S. al-
lies and their sovereignty, and violate
international law, sends the wrong
message to the enemies of freedom and
stability around the world.
The clock has nearly struck mid-
night on the U.S.-Turkey relationship,
and the time has come for Turkey to
choose whether it will stand with the
United States and NATO or fall with
revisionist powers like Russia and
China.
In closing, Madam Speaker, I would
like to applaud my good friends, Chair-
man ENGEL and Ranking Member
MCCAUL, along with Leaders HOYER
and MCCARTHY and the leadership of
both the House Appropriations and Ju-
diciary Committees, who made this
possible.
I urge my colleagues to pass this res-
olution.
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Let me just say this: Chairman
ENGEL and I met with the Foreign Min-
ister of Turkey and their Ambassador
trying to avoid this impasse, this
choice between Russia and the United
States.
And Chairman ENGEL and I talked
about this alliance that we have with
them.
Nearly 70 years ago, NATO and the
United States stood with Turkey
against growing Soviet aggression. In
fact, that is the reason NATO was
formed in the first place. That is why
we have Incirlik Air Force Base in Tur-
key. And yet, the idea that Turkey
would break from this alliance and
choose Russia over the United States,
truly, is a defining moment for Turkey.
I hope they are listening to this de-
bate as we speak right now. They still
have time to salvage this, what I con-
sider to be an error in judgment of
choosing Russia over NATO and the
United States of America.
That is why this resolution is so im-
portant. It sends a very strong message
to Erdogan and to Turkey, that we are
not going to allow this to happen; and,
in fact, it would run afoul of the sanc-
tions that we passed almost over-
whelmingly in the House and Senate
against Russia. It would sort of violate
the Russia sanctions law.
Madam Speaker, I want to thank
Chairman ENGEL for his strong bipar-
tisan support on this issue. We are on
the right side of history, and I urge my
colleagues to support this.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume for
the purpose of closing.
Once again, I am pleased to support
this bipartisan measure that strength-
ens our security policy in Europe. I
thank Ranking Member MCCAUL and
all of the other chairs and ranking
members of important committees who
have stood by us on this bill. It is real-
ly a Congress speaking with one voice
in a very bipartisan fashion for some-
thing that is really very important.
Today’s resolution reaffirms the his-
toric partnership between the United
States and Turkey, and it lays the
groundwork for how Erdogan can start
to put this relationship back on the
right track.
We cannot stand by as he turns this
NATO ally into an authoritarian re-
gime aligned with Vladimir Putin. So I
urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting this measure.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from New York (Mr.
ENGEL) that the House suspend the
rules and agree to the resolution, H.
Res. 372.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the resolu-
tion was agreed to.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

UNITED STATES-MEXICO TOURISM
IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I move
to suspend the rules and pass the bill
(H.R. 951) to promote bilateral tourism
through cooperation between the
United States and Mexico, as amended.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 951
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘United
States-Mexico Tourism Improvement Act of
2019’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) The United States and Mexico have ben-
efitted economically from a bilateral, mutu-
ally beneficial partnership focused on en-
hancing the tourism industry in both coun-
tries.
(2) In 2016, Mexican tourism to the United
States peaked at 18,990,585 visitors, consti-
tuting 1 in 4 (24.9 percent) of all tourists that
year.
(3) Additionally, in 2016, spending by Mexi-
can tourists in the United States totaled
$20.3 billion, which represented a 3 percent
growth from 2015.
(4) Tourist activity to the United States
from Mexico has declined since 2016, which is
in contrast to an overall international tour-
ism industry increase in the United States.
(5) In 2017, international tourist arrivals
totaled 76,900,000, up 0.7 percent from
76,400,000 in 2016.
(6) The same year, 77,000,000 international
visitors spent a record $251.4 billion on ho-
tels, travel, food, and souvenirs, a 2-percent
increase over 2016.
(7) However, also in 2017, there was a 6.1-
percent decline in visitors to the United
States from Mexico, comprising a loss of
1,166,585 Mexican tourists from 2016.
(8) The Department of Commerce has not
yet released 2017 spending totals by Mexican
tourists in the United States, but a cor-
responding monetary decline would be ap-
proximately $1.24 billion in lost revenue.
(9) This is a critical economic trend given
that Mexico is the biggest source of inter-
national visitors to the United States after
Canada.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 951,
as amended.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, let me start by
thanking the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. CUELLAR), the recently-appointed
chairman of the U.S.-Mexico Inter-
parliamentary Group, for authoring
this legislation, which sends a positive
message from this Chamber to the
Mexican people at a time when, frank-
ly, it is needed more than ever in view
of all the things that have been talked
about with American belligerence to-
ward Mexico and the unnecessary saber
rattling.
b 1945
I think it is important that we talk
about positive things between our two
countries, and tourism certainly is
right there. It is one way to make a
positive difference.
In recent years, bilateral tourism be-
tween the United States and Mexico
has steadily declined. This is in sharp
contrast to a rise in the broader inter-
national tourism industry in the
United States.
In 2017 alone, there was a 6 percent
decline in visitors to the United States
from Mexico, and this decrease hurts
our economy and American workers,
specifically in the States along our
southern border with Mexico where
President Trump is still trying to build
an ill-advised wall.
The legislation we are now consid-
ering would direct the State Depart-
ment to expand tourism cooperation
with Mexico, including by close col-
laboration with nonprofit organiza-
tions and the private sector. It also en-
courages expanded third-party tourism
to the United States and Mexico
through joint international pro-
motional efforts.
But more than anything, this bill is
about jobs. It is about creating Amer-
ican jobs and maintaining a robust
partnership with our neighbor to the
south.
Its consideration could not be more
timely. Last month, the President
again threatened to punish American
workers and consumers for failures at
the border, only to claim victory with
a so-called deal that reverted to the
status quo. The President has again
managed to cause further harm to the
U.S.-Mexico relationship for no good
reason whatsoever, and tourists are
staying home in response.
Today, the House of Representatives
is choosing to go in a different direc-
tion. With this bill, we are once again
coming to the House floor to build
bridges with our neighbor to the south.
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr.
CUELLAR for his continued persistence
in promoting the U.S.-Mexico relation-
ship. I urge my colleagues to support
the legislation, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself as much time as I may
consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
the United States-Mexico Tourism Im-
provement Act of 2019.
I want to thank Chairman ENGEL and
also thank my good friend HENRY
CUELLAR for leading this legislation,
which we introduced together earlier
this year.
I must say, the timing probably
couldn’t be better, as we avoided a tar-
iff situation on Mexico in exchange for
some security cooperation.
We know, being from Texas, that
Mexico is our largest trading partner.
Just last month, Mexico now has be-
come the United States’ largest trad-
ing partner.
We understand well the value of tour-
ism from our neighbors to the south,
what that provides to our economy. As
a matter of fact, Mr. CUELLAR and I
both chair the U.S.-Mexico Inter-
parliamentary Group, and I look for-
ward to working together to strength-
en our ties with the Mexican Congress
to address our mutual interests rather
than divide.
Tourism between the United States
and Mexico, in both directions, is
worth tens of billions of dollars to our
economies every year. To help increase
these benefits, this bill directs the
State Department to develop a strat-
egy to expand tourism through co-
operation with Mexico, including col-
laboration with governmental and non-
governmental entities.
Legitimate tourism between our two
countries, in my view, strengthens our
economies, strengthens our cultures
and our partnership together, and
should be encouraged and expanded.
Madam Speaker, once again, let me
just thank my good friend Mr. CUELLAR
for his hard work. He does a lot of good
work between the United States and
Mexico, and I fully look forward to
working together with him as we serve
together in this Congress.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield
4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. CUELLAR), the author of this bill,
who also happens to be the chair of the
U.S.-Mexico Interparliamentary Group.
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I
want to thank Chairman ENGEL for
yielding to me and for his leadership
that he has provided in making sure
that we develop a good working rela-
tionship with the Republic of Mexico.
In fact, a few months ago, we also
passed a U.S.-Mexico economic devel-
opment bill that is over in the Senate,
and now today we are passing a tour-
ism bill that will be used to promote
this important relationship.
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the
chairman for his leadership.
I also want to thank the ranking
member, a friend of mine who is also
with me on the U.S.-Mexico Inter-
parliamentary Group, and I want to
thank him because, as a Texan, he also
understands this very important rela-
tionship that we have with Mexico.
Madam Speaker, I also want to thank
the majority staff and, certainly, the
minority staff for the Committee on
Foreign Affairs because they get it.
They understand the type of legislation
that we need to have to improve this
relationship that we have between the
U.S. and Mexico. So I want to thank
both staffs.
The relationship with Mexico is very
important. Let me first talk about
trade.
Every day, there is more than $1.7
billion of trade between the U.S. and
Mexico. That is over $1 million every
single minute, the trade that we have
between these two countries.
If we look at the more than 5 million
jobs that have been created because of
the trade that we have with Mexico, it
is important that we nourish this rela-
tionship.
So it is not only the trade that we
have, the commerce that we have, but
it is certainly also the tourism.
In 2016, we had over 19 million Mexi-
cans that came over and spent over
$20.5 billion at our restaurants, at our

hotels, at our malls, at our stores—a
lot of money that has been spent here
in the United States. But the last cou-
ple years, we have seen a different
trend.
While international tourist arrivals
in the U.S. have totaled 79.6 million
visitors, which has been almost a 5 per-
cent increase, a 4.2 percent increase,
the tourism from Mexico has actually
decreased, and, again, for different rea-
sons.
Again, if we call them murderers,
rapists, and other words, they are not
going to come and spend the money. So
we have to make sure that we get our
friends to the south to come back and
spend money because, again, in 2016,
Mexican tourism to the United States
peaked at almost 19 million, which
means that one out of every four inter-
national visitors, that is almost 25 per-
cent of the tourists coming from across
the world, was coming here to the
United States from Mexico.
Madam Speaker, this is why, with
Chairman ENGEL and my good friend,
the ranking member, MICHAEL MCCAUL,
we are trying to make sure that we get
this tourism back because, again, it is
good for our economy.
What does this bill do? Basically, it
is asking that we focus on doing a cou-
ple things:
Having the State Department de-
velop a strategy to expand this bilat-
eral tourism with Mexico;
Encouraging collaboration between
governmental and nongovernmental
entities;
Making sure that this strategy is at
the highest level, which is, again, at
the High Level Economic Dialogue
platform with Mexico; and
Making sure that the Mexican Gov-
ernment is involved.
I have spoken to some of the Mexican
congressmen that we met last time we
were there, like, for example, Congress-
man Luis Alegre from the Cancun area.
They know that this tourism business
is very important.
Madam Speaker, again, I want to
thank the chairman; I want to thank
the ranking member; and, again, I
want to thank the staff for putting this
bill up.
Madam Speaker, again, I urge my
colleagues in the House to pass this
measure which will return the eco-
nomic benefits of bilateral tourism
with Mexico again to our U.S. busi-
nesses and entrepreneurs.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from Laredo, Texas, who really
made a good case for this bill. He
knows, being the largest land port in
the United States, what trade and
tourism means for Mexico and the
United States.
This bill will not only strengthen our
economies, which is always a positive
thing, but I think it will strengthen
our relationship. It will also strength-
en our security, working together, and
it deepens our rich cultural ties that
we have and that we know is so impor-
tant.
I think it is good for both nations, a
step forward in the right direction.
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my
good friend HENRY CUELLAR for bring-
ing this legislation. I urge my col-
leagues to support it, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself as much time as I may consume
for the purpose of closing.
Madam Speaker, the U.S.-Mexico re-
lationship is too important to be held
hostage to petty politics, and yet here
we are again for the last 2 weeks.
We don’t want to hurt the U.S.-Mex-
ico relationship. In fact, I was in Mex-
ico City just a few weeks ago and met
with the new Mexican President, who
told us that he really wanted to have
good relations and work closely with
us. I was impressed with him because
he has a steady hand.
I think that we should not be alien-
ating our neighbors. We should be wel-
coming them, welcoming the partner-
ship with them.
We don’t want to undermine tourism;
we don’t want to hurt Americans; and
we don’t want to raise taxes on the
working class while doing nothing to
address the humanitarian challenges
on the U.S.-Mexico border.
I am glad that we seem to not be
going that way in terms of clashing
with Mexico, but, again, this is a win-
win bill: a win for us because it helps
tourism, a win for Mexico as well.
Congress has chosen to pursue a posi-
tive agenda with Mexico instead. This
legislation will play an important role
in showcasing the mutually beneficial
relationship Congress and most Ameri-
cans want with Mexico.
Madam Speaker, I again thank Mr.
CUELLAR for his continued leadership
and for wanting a stronger relationship
between the United States and Mexico.
I thank the ranking member, as usual,
for working with us on this legislation.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and
I yield back the balance of my time.

PREVENTING CHILD MARRIAGE IN
DISPLACED POPULATIONS ACT
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I move
to suspend the rules and pass the bill
(H.R. 2140) to prevent child marriage in
United Nations-administered refugee
settlements, and for other purposes, as
amended.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 2140
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Preventing
Child Marriage in Displaced Populations
Act’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) According to UNICEF, 12 million girls
marry before the age of 18 every year.
(2) Early marriage denies children, espe-
cially girls, their right to make vital deci-
sions about their well-being, including relat-
ing to their health, family, and career. Child
brides are less likely to finish their edu-
cation, and are at higher risk for abuse, con-
tracting HIV, and dying while pregnant or
giving birth.
(3) Child marriage also imposes substantial
economic costs to developing countries, im-
peding development and prosperity gains.
(4) Displaced populations are particularly
vulnerable to child marriage, in commu-
nities where poverty, instability, and dis-
placement put pressure on families to marry
children, particularly young girls, off at a
young age.
(5) One United Nations (UN) study found
that child marriage rates were four times
higher among displaced Syrian refugees than
among Syrians before the crisis. This indi-
cates that displacement, instability, and
poverty are driving child marriages.
(6) United Nations agencies, including
UNICEF and UNHCR, have acknowledged the
dangers of child marriage and taken steps to
address its risk in the populations they
serve.
(7) The UN Joint Program on Child Mar-
riage supports this work by building the re-
silience of populations to indirectly prevent
child marriage and by generating new data
and evidence on the prevalence of child mar-
riage in humanitarian and fragile settings.
For example, in Uganda, the UN Joint Pro-
gram on Child Marriage helped 27,000 adoles-
cent girls strengthen critical skills through
school clubs and Go Back to School cam-
paigns, as well as life-skills and financial lit-
eracy training.
(8) After the UN Joint Program on Child
Marriage identified Yemen as one of its focus
countries, 65,000 people, of whom 45,000 are
adolescents, were reached with awareness
raising activities on the harms of child mar-
riage in 2018 alone. As a result, local council
representatives, elders, and community lead-
ers from six districts signed a pledge to sup-
port advocacy efforts to end child marriage.
SEC. 3. PREVENTING CHILD MARRIAGE IN DIS-
PLACED POPULATIONS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—The President shall direct
the United States Permanent Representative
to the United Nations to use the voice, vote,
and influence of the United States at the
United Nations to call for an adoption of an
agreed-upon definition of ‘‘child marriage’’
across United Nations agencies.
(b) STRATEGY.—The President shall direct
the United States Permanent Representative
to the United Nations to use the voice, vote,
and influence of the United States at the
United Nations to call for the development
of a comprehensive strategy to address child
marriage in refugee settlements adminis-
tered by the United Nations. Such strategy
should include the following:
(1) A mandate to regularly collect and re-
port data related to the number of known or
suspected child marriages taking place in-
side each such settlement.
(2) Protocols for United Nations personnel
regarding prevention and monitoring of child
marriages inside each such settlement.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2140,
as amended.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, let me start by
thanking the gentlewoman from Mis-
souri (Mrs. WAGNER) for offering this
bill and for shining a light on the prob-
lem of illegal child marriage, particu-
larly among vulnerable refugee popu-
lations. I am grateful for Mrs. WAG-
NER’s leadership on an issue that we
should all support. It is really impor-
tant to all get around it.
Child marriage, Madam Speaker, de-
prives young people of their futures
and hinders the progress of develop-
ment work all over the world.
UNICEF reports that 12 million girls
marry before the age of 18 every single
year. What does that mean for these
girls? It takes away their right to
make vital decisions about their well-
being, about their health, their family,
their future.
Child brides are also less likely to
finish their education and are at higher
risk for abuse, contracting HIV, and
dying while pregnant or giving birth.
Refugee populations are particularly
vulnerable to child marriage. Poverty,
instability, and displacement pressure
families into marrying off children,
particularly young girls, at an early
age.
For example, child marriage among
Syrian refugees in Jordan increased
from 15 percent in 2014 to 36 percent in
2018. One survey of Syrian refugees in
Lebanon found that nearly a quarter of
girls between 15 and 17 were married.
In Bangladesh, Rohingya refugees
fleeing violence in Burma have re-
ported marrying off young girls to pro-
tect them from sexual violence.
Stopping this cycle and ending ille-
gal child marriage is critical to sup-
porting refugees and empowering youth
for a better future.
A number of U.N. agencies are doing
important work to address child mar-
riage among the populations they
serve. For example, the U.N.’s Joint
Program on Child Marriage, a joint ef-
fort between UNICEF and UNFPA, is
gathering new data and evidence on
this problem and helping to build resil-
ience in vulnerable populations, includ-
ing refugees.
b 2000
But there is much more we can be
doing, and this bill demonstrates
American support for tackling this
problem. It would require us to flex our
muscles in the U.N. to come up with a
comprehensive definition of child mar-
riage. It would also require a new
strategy to ensure that displaced popu-
lations have the protections and the
tools to avoid illegal child marriage.
We want to empower young people to
have a better future, and this bill will
help us get at a problem that threatens
far too many futures, so I am pleased
to support this measure.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge
my colleagues to support H.R. 2140, the
Preventing Child Marriage in Displaced
Populations Act, and I thank the chair-
man, along with the ranking member
and all of my colleagues, for supporting
this piece of bipartisan legislation
through Foreign Affairs.
Humanitarian crises put women and
girls at a much higher risk of violence
and exploitation, including child mar-
riage. Nine of the ten countries with
the highest rates of child marriage are
fragile states where weak institutions,
high rates of violence, and stagnant
economies make families more likely
to resort to child marriage.
One United Nations study found that
child marriage rates were four times
higher among displaced Syrian refu-
gees than among Syrians before the
crisis. This indicates that displace-
ment, instability, and poverty are driv-
ing child marriages.
Important research conducted by
UNICEF revealed that, in 2018, more
than 700 million women and girls,
worldwide, were married before their
18th birthday; and of these, 250 million
were married before their 15th birth-
day. Madam Speaker, these women are
more likely to experience domestic vio-
lence and have worse educational, eco-
nomic, and health prospects than their
unmarried peers.
United Nations agencies have ac-
knowledged the dangers of child mar-
riage and taken steps to address it. The
U.N. Joint Program on Child Marriage
builds the resilience of populations to
indirectly prevent child marriage and
generates data and evidence on the
prevalence of child marriage in human-
itarian and fragile settings.
In Uganda, the U.N. Joint Program
on Child Marriage helped 27,000 adoles-
cent girls strengthen critical skills
through school clubs and Go Back to
School campaigns, as well as life skills
and financial literacy training.
Last year, after the U.N. Joint Pro-
gram on Child Marriage identified
Yemen as one of its focus countries,
65,000 people, of whom 45,000 were ado-
lescents, were reached with awareness-
raising activities on the harms of child
marriage. As a result, local council
representatives, elders, and community
leaders from six districts signed a
pledge to support advocacy efforts to
end child marriage.
My legislation would direct the
United States to lead U.N. efforts to
adopt a definition of ‘‘child marriage’’
and craft a comprehensive strategy to
address child marriages in U.N.-admin-
istered refugee settlements. This strat-
egy would include protocols to prevent
and monitor child marriages; programs
to provide physical, mental, and emo-
tional support for victims; programs
offering alternatives for child mar-
riage; and measures to ensure that
adults who are participating in illegal
child marriages are held accountable.
Child marriage is a violation of
human rights and a form of violence
against women and children. I urge my
colleagues to support the Preventing
Child Marriage in Displaced Popu-
lations Act.
Madam Speaker, in closing, I want to
thank the chairman for working with
the ranking member, myself, and all of
our colleagues on a bipartisan basis to
make sure that we are supporting
women and girls in these U.N. refugee
camps. It is wonderful to be part of a
committee that works in such a strong,
bipartisan fashion. I am grateful for
their support.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, first, I
want to thank the author of this bill
for her kind words.
As she pointed out, child marriage is
a problem that befalls far too many
young people around the world, espe-
cially among desperate families who,
because of poverty or instability, feel
they have no choice but to commit
their children to marriage. Of course,
when this happens, it starts another
cycle of poverty and instability, of
abuse and illness. It is just a tragedy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4385
June 10, 2019
This is one of those issues where we
look at the situation and see a moral
obligation to act. Dealing with this
problem in our foreign policy is a re-
flection of our country’s values, of our
commitment to the rights and dignity
of all people. This bill will help make
sure our policy stays aligned with
those values and that we are doing
more to end the scourge of child mar-
riage.
I again thank Representative WAG-
NER for her work on this measure. I
urge all Members to support it.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from New York (Mr.
ENGEL) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2140, as
amended.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as
amended, was passed.
The title of the bill was amended so
as to read: ‘‘A bill To prevent child
marriage in refugee settlements ad-
ministered by the United Nations, and
for other purposes.’’.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

HONORING ATLANTIC COUNTY 4–H
PROGRAM
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker,
since its start in the 1940s, the Atlantic
County 4–H program has encouraged
young people from all communities and
backgrounds to immerse themselves in
areas of science, health, agriculture,
and civic engagement.
The Atlantic County 4–H program is
one of the longest running programs in
the country and teaches valuable life
skills to youth in grades K–13. Through
4–H, these young people are engaged in
a variety of hands-on projects from
livestock to computer science, from
gardening to expressive arts.
These experiences, of course, could
not be possible without the help of vol-
unteers. We are honored to have over 40
volunteers in Hammonton, among
many others, and I want to particu-
larly thank a few members of the com-
munity who have dedicated many years
of service and of their time and exper-
tise to this program.
Thank you to Kathleen Einwechter,
who has been volunteering for 25 years.
Thank you to Al Schollenberger, who
has been volunteering for 45 years.
And thank you to Dorothy Calimer,
who has been giving her time and care
to this program for 50 years.
You and all of our community flour-
ish, and I am excited to celebrate you
today. I am excited about your work,
about your volunteerism, and about
the difference that you make.
TAKING STEPS TO PROTECT ALL
HUMAN LIFE
(Ms. FOXX of North Carolina asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute.)
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I rise to applaud the Trump
administration for its proactive steps
to ban fetal tissue research.
Last week, HHS terminated the
NIH’s $13 million contract with the
University of California, San Francisco
for research involving human fetal tis-
sue from elective abortions.
Madam Speaker, we should not use
aborted babies for research, period.
Furthermore, we don’t need to because
there are scientifically credible alter-
natives, and this administration is ex-
panding them.
Just last December, NIH announced
$20 million for finding ethical alter-
natives to fetal tissue research. Yet the
Democratic Party supports research
with aborted baby parts, refuses to pro-
tect babies born alive after an at-
tempted abortion, and even decries the
Hyde amendment, the most basic of
protections for taxpayer money.
Thankfully, our pro-life President
will ensure that only forward steps will
be taken to protect all human life.
f
PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN) is recognized
for 60 minutes as the designee of the
minority leader.
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I
would like to spend today addressing
the events over the weekend with re-
gard to President Trump’s decision and
then decision to withdraw the threat of
a 5 percent tariff on goods coming in
through Mexico.
I particularly want to comment with
regard to observations that I have
made, because 10 days ago I was in
Mexico in the Laredo sector of the bor-
der, and about 4 months ago I was in
the Tucson sector of the border. Both
times, I received a thorough tour of the
border from our great Border Patrol,
and the observations that I have made
down there lead me to believe that we
ought to stick with President Trump
as he does what he can to defend our
border. Indeed, my analysis in both Ar-
izona and Texas is that, right now, we
are facing one of the greatest threats
to the future of America.
Before going into it in general, I
would like to thank our Border Patrol
for all the wonderful things they are
doing.
I don’t know how many Americans
know that, right now, our Border Pa-
trol has 2,000 empty positions. The Bor-
der Patrol should have 21,000 people. It
has got only 19,000 people on the bor-
der.
Right now, we are in the position in
which the Border Patrol is processing
over 130,000 people a month, up from
only a bit over 40,000 a month just 7 or
8 years ago. This means, since, like ev-
erything else in the world, a lot of pa-
perwork is required wherever some-
thing is done, that the Border Patrol is
woefully underfunded and understaffed.
I would like to apologize to the Bor-
der Patrol for a statement made by one
of my colleagues in which she stated:
With five kids that have died, 5,000 sepa-
rated from their families, I feel like the evi-
dence is really clear that this is intentional.
It is a policy choice being made on purpose,
and it is cruel and inhumane.
Madam Speaker, I will tell you, those
Border Patrol folks and the customs
people are working as hard as they pos-
sibly can. Maybe people don’t realize
that, last month, over 13,000 unaccom-
panied minors came across the border.
That is not people who are separated
from their families. Those are minors
who come in separated from their fami-
lies. Many of these people have spent
days coming through Mexico to come
here.
We were told that one of the prob-
lems they had is that, when Border Pa-
trol began to take care of kids, some of
these kids were used to having one
meal every 2 days. It took a while for
their bodies to get used to having three
meals a day. They are receiving med-
ical care within the first 48 hours they
are here and thorough medical care
within 72 hours after they come here.
I would say that people coming here
are getting better medical care than
perhaps they have ever had in their
life—and surely better nutrition than
they have had in a long time, better
education than they have had in a long
time.
For Members of Congress to respond
to the great deal that the Border Pa-
trol is doing when, inevitably, despite
their best efforts, a couple of people
have come here without medical treat-
ment for weeks, to claim that the Bor-
der Patrol or somehow the administra-
tion is intentionally allowing kids to
die after they worked so hard to save
the kids is one of the most embar-
rassing things I have seen in this Con-
gress.
I assure members of the Border Pa-
trol that, at least among the people I
hang around with, we respect the job
they are doing, and I invite all of my
colleagues to come down to the border
so they don’t make a ridiculous state-
ment that, when a few people are not
able to be kept alive down there, it is
something done on purpose.
b 2015
Let’s look at the crisis down there
and the hand Donald Trump is being
dealt.
In May, the Border Patrol itself—and
this is before Customs, just the Border
Patrol—found over 130,000 people cross-
ing the border. The vast majority of
those came here seeking asylum, which
means they aren’t going to be kicked
out. They are given a court date 3, 4, or
5 years out in the future and given a
green card to go find a job.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4386 June 10, 2019
This is a much worse situation than
when large numbers of people crossed
the border 12 or 15 years ago. At that
time, people would come across, and
they would be told to go back. They
would try again, and they would go
back. We might have the same person
counted three or four times.
Here, with the vast majority being
asylum claims, they will stay here, and
they will get green cards. We are in a
situation in which our Border Patrol is
overwhelmed, not to mention we are no
longer picking our immigrants, as we
do when people are sworn in legally, as
we do when they get regular work per-
mits. Instead, we are getting people
who are sneaking in here or claiming
asylum under questionable cir-
cumstances.
We also find that when we are, in es-
sence, telling the world that we have
open borders, more and more people
come here. When we talked to Cus-
toms, which is a small segment of the
number of people who are coming here,
we were getting people from beyond
Mexico or Central America. We are get-
ting people from Venezuela. We are
getting people from Cuba. We are get-
ting people from Africa. In other
words, the whole world is finding out
that, right now, we are not enforcing
our immigration laws.
It is not surprising that when a lot of
people come here, particularly when we
are dealing with a border controlled by
dangerous cartels, that people die try-
ing to get in here. In the Tucson sector
last year, almost 250 people were found
dehydrated to death. The reason they
were found that way is because the car-
tels may escort them to the United
States, but they don’t escort them to
civilization. They just direct them to
go one place or the other, and they
wind up dying in the desert.
In the Laredo sector, it is not un-
usual to have people drown in the Rio
Grande River. Again, because there is a
perception that America doesn’t en-
force its immigration laws, people try
to walk across the Rio Grande. They
are swept under, in the undertow, and
they wind up dying. They wind up
drowning.
Again, these deaths are the fault of a
system in which people believe that we
do not enforce our immigration laws.
What was President Trump to do?
The obvious thing to do would be to
tell Congress that we need more Border
Patrol agents so that people don’t
sneak in here. The obvious thing to do
would be to tell Congress that we need
more judges to make sure that when
people claim asylum, their claims are
heard immediately, and they can be
sent back rather than sit around here
for 3 or 4 years. The obvious thing to do
would be to build a wall, which may
cost $7 billion or $8 billion.
If we do those three things, we would
send a message to the world that our
immigration laws are supposed to be
respected. We would no longer have so
many people drown in the Rio Grande.
We would no longer have so many peo-
ple dehydrate to death. We would no
longer have a situation in which the
U.S. taxpayer is on the hook for prob-
ably over $100 billion a year between
medical expenses, education expenses,
and criminal justice expenses. That is
what would happen if we began to en-
force our immigration laws.
However, when President Trump
asked for help from this body, this Con-
gress that is so quick to spend money
on everything, this Congress that last
time around increased discretionary
spending over 11 percent in 1 year, this
House of Representatives that is about
to pass a series of appropriations bills
increasing discretionary spending by 4
or 5 percent a year, all of a sudden, this
Congress decides to get frugal on the
one thing that is the biggest crisis of
all.
So, President Trump is in a box. Be-
cause we won’t give him any more
money, eventually, he decides that per-
haps by imposing tariffs on Mexico, he
can stop what amounts to an invasion
of the United States.
What does President Trump get? He
gets Senators from his own party
shooting at him from behind. He gets
American businesses looking at their
profit and loss for the next quarter,
profit and loss for the next year, not
considering the damage that is done to
America over the next 2, 3, 4, or 5 years
as unlimited people are coming here.
They are shooting him in the back.
Shame on the Republicans.
I am not afraid of being critical of
President Trump. He tweets a little too
much. But I will tell my colleagues
that when President Trump is finally
trying to get us to enforce our borders,
he is being shot at by his own team, by
members of the Chamber of Commerce
and by Republican Members of the Sen-
ate. This has to stop, or we are going to
lose our country.
It is important that the American
people stand up and let their elected
representatives know this cannot go on
any longer. We have to do something
about the border.
It is embarrassing how little this
body is doing. It is embarrassing the
small amount of money or no money
that is being spent in the areas that it
has to be spent. Quite frankly, it is em-
barrassing that more Congressmen are
not speaking out on what is going on at
the southern border, other than our
friend from Illinois, who kind of im-
plies that when somebody dies in the
horrible system that exists right now,
that it was done intentionally.
In any event, I encourage American
businesses to stop looking at just what
is going on in their profit and loss
statements next quarter or next year. I
encourage the Republican representa-
tives, all representatives, to under-
stand that President Trump, when he
tries to do something at the border, he
is trying to protect America in the fu-
ture and not get cheap political points
by implying that we can continue to go
ahead with the current system of over
130,000 people coming here.
I do want to point out that President
Trump, who is very pro-immigrant, is
not talking about reducing the 700,000
new people sworn in as Americans
every year. President Trump is not
talking about reducing the 4 million
people who are here every year on work
permits. Indeed, President Trump has
made it clear that we could increase
that number of people coming here le-
gally.
We have to stop people coming across
the border on bogus claims of asylum
and sneaking across the border and
other places.
It is time for this House to act. Fill
those vacant 2,000 slots on the Border
Patrol and add another 2,000 or 3,000.
It is time for this body to act and get
some judges on the border to adju-
dicate the asylum claims.
It is time for this House to act and
make sure that we have a secure border
through a wall.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

Vol. 165 WASHINGTON, MONDAY, JUNE 10, 2019 No. 96
Senate
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was
called to order by the President pro
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).
f
PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Eternal God, fountain of blessings,
thank You for the life and legacy of Dr.
Lloyd John Ogilvie, the 61st Chaplain
of the United States Senate. Accept
our gratitude for his unswerving integ-
rity, ethical congruence, exemplary
life, and sanctified service. We praise
You for his preaching and writing gifts
that provided counsel and guidance,
beckoning us to start and maintain a
relationship with You.
Lord, You used Dr. Ogilvie to bring
deliverance to captives, to restore
sight to the ethically blind, and to
unshackle those held by the chains of
addiction and despair. Thank You for
the force of his convictions that
brought unity to division, light to
darkness, and hope to despair.
Comfort his beloved Doris, his loved
ones, and all of us who mourn his
death. Inspired by his great life, may
our lawmakers accept the challenge to
strive by words and actions to bring
glory to Your Name.
We pray in Your sovereign Name.
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The President pro tempore led the
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
f
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms.
ERNST). Under the previous order, the
leadership time is reserved.
The Senator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
ask to speak as in morning business for
1 minute.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
f
DISASTER RELIEF
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President,
Iowa continues to flood and in some
cases reflood. Since March, Iowa has
been inundated with water on both the
Missouri and Mississippi Rivers and
their tributaries. In the past several
weeks, there have been multiple torna-
does causing havoc as well.
I am pleased that Congress passed a
supplemental bill that will provide
some additional funds for recovery.
However, I know we have many chal-
lenges ahead of us, both for the people
living in Iowa and those who represent
Iowa. Also, it would not surprise me if,
after the final tallies of the disaster
that has been done through floods and
other natural disasters, we will need
additional appropriations before the
end of the fiscal year.
I look forward to continuing to work
with individuals, communities, the
State of Iowa, and the Federal Govern-
ment to find ways to help Iowa recover
and come back stronger than ever and,
of course, that will help not only Iowa
but other areas of the country that are
likewise hit.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
MEASURE PLACED ON THE
CALENDAR—H.R. 6
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I
understand there is a bill at the desk
that is due for a second reading.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will read the title of the bill for
the second time.
The bill clerk read as follows:
A bill (H.R. 6) to authorize the cancellation
of removal and adjustment of status of cer-
tain aliens and for other purposes.
Mr. CORNYN. In order to place the
bill on the calendar under the provi-
sions of rule XIV, I object to further
proceedings.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection having been heard, the bill will
be placed on the calendar.

CONCLUSION OF MORNING

the United States Court of Federal
Claims for a term of fifteen years.
The Senator from Texas.
BORDER SECURITY AND TARIFFS
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I
suppose we were all shocked when Cus-
toms and Border Protection announced
that more than 103,000 people illegally
crossed our southern border in March.
In April, we couldn’t believe it when
that number jumped to more than
109,000, and now we are in complete dis-
belief that in May more than 144,000

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3274 June 10, 2019
people illegally crossed our southern
border.
I found it interesting that in com-
ments by one of the Presidential can-
didates running on the other side of the
aisle, BERNIE SANDERS, who, according
to Axios, is running second to Joe
Biden in the 2020 Democratic primary
polls, called what is happening at the
border now a ‘‘serious problem’’ but
not a crisis. When asked what more ur-
gent crises there may be, he said: Well,
that is an issue we have to deal with,
but the issue of climate change is a
more serious crisis.
He mentioned that, among other
items.
Senator SANDERS finds himself in dis-
agreement, I suppose, with President
Barack Obama, who, in 2014, called
what was happening at the border,
when the numbers were far lower, a hu-
manitarian and security crisis.
President Obama’s Secretary of the
Department of Homeland Security, Jeh
Johnson, disagrees with Senator SAND-
ERS. He said: ‘‘There is a crisis at the
southern border that needs [the] urgent
attention [of] Congress.’’
As it turns out, it is something that
Congress itself is capable of addressing
but so far has refused any efforts to try
to come up with a compromise piece of
language that would deal with this on-
going humanitarian and security crisis.
Vice President PENCE’s Chief of Staff
said: As opposed to bellyaching about
the actions the President is taking to
actually secure the border, it would be
nice if they put as much energy into
actually fixing the problem legisla-
tively.
I couldn’t agree more with the Vice
President’s spokesman, or Chief of
Staff, in the remarks that he made.
In May of 2019, this was the third
month in a row in which the number of
individuals who crossed the border ille-
gally was in six figures, a trend that we
haven’t seen since 2006, when the year-
ly total topped more than 1 million. I
wouldn’t be surprised if we hit that an-
nual total again this year.
Since the beginning of October, Cus-
toms and Border Protection has en-
countered more than 667,000 illegal bor-
der crossings, making this the first
time in a decade that we have exceeded
half a million apprehensions in a year.
Don’t forget, we still have 5 months to
go.
The government’s spokesman said
last week: ‘‘We are experiencing a sys-
temwide emergency that is severely
impacting our workforce, facilities,
and resources.’’
‘‘A systemwide emergency,’’ he
called it. This isn’t a manufactured cri-
sis, as we heard a few months ago from
some of our Democratic friends and
colleagues. This is not a political
stunt. Our Democratic colleagues con-
tinue to pretend that there is not a
problem.
In the face of rapidly dwindling funds
and resources to manage the thousands
of people in the custody of Customs
and Border Protection, our Democratic
colleagues will not even provide addi-
tional funding to help the officers and
agents who are working day and night
to safeguard our border and to care for
the migrants in their custody. I hope
this recent data will force our Demo-
cratic colleagues to recognize the re-
ality that this crisis is happening and
it is growing.
Even the editorial board of the New
York Times, never quick to agree with
President Trump or Republicans—they
say it is time to do something about it.
In an editorial in today’s paper, they
said: ‘‘When Will Congress Get Serious
About the Suffering at the Border?’’
Madam President, I ask unanimous
consent to have printed in the RECORD
a New York Times editorial dated June
9, 2019, following my remarks.
An excerpt from the editorial of the
New York Times editorial board said:
Unequipped to deal with the crush, border
facilities and migrant shelters are dan-
gerously overcrowded, and the staff is over-
burdened. Dysfunction, disease and even
death are a growing reality.
‘‘We are in a full-blown emergency, and I
cannot say this stronger: The system is bro-
ken,’’ the Acting Commissioner of Customs
and Border Protection, John Sanders, said.
The editorial goes on to say:
In short, it is time for Congress to stop
dithering and pass emergency funding to
deal with this nightmare.
When the President announced his
intention to impose new tariffs on Mex-
ico, trying to bring them to the bar-
gaining table to make sure that it
stood up its efforts to try to prevent
this flow of humanity from Central
America, there were many people who
questioned the use of that negotiating
tool. I, for one, was concerned that it
would certainly have unintended ef-
fects, but this is something the Presi-
dent would never have had to do if
Members of Congress on the other side
of the aisle would simply work with us
to provide a legislative solution and,
certainly, if Democrats would work
with Republicans to provide the emer-
gency funding that is so urgently need-
ed for this humanitarian crisis.
Thankfully, the President was suc-
cessful in his negotiations with the
Mexican Government, and now we will
see whether that 144,000 number in May
actually begins to come down. That
will be the best evidence of whether
Mexico’s agreement with U.S. nego-
tiators actually is providing concrete
results.
It is time to put politics aside and
start discussing real solutions. We
know there are no quick fixes when it
comes to improving the situation at
the border. It is going to require a
long-term commitment by Congress
and the administration, as well as our
Mexican and Central American coun-
terparts. Part of that commitment in-
volves making physical improvements
along the border and investing in infra-
structure, personnel, and technology.
It is the three-pronged approach that
experts have repeatedly told me is
needed to be successful, and it is ex-
actly what Congress ought to be all
about providing. We can’t just put up a
strong physical defense and call it a
day. We need to devote a great deal of
time and effort to making improve-
ments to reduce both the push factors
from these Central American countries
and the pull factors, which encourage
these migrants to come to the United
States in these kinds of incredible
numbers.
My friend and colleague HENRY
CUELLAR, who happens to be a Demo-
crat in the House of Representatives,
and I have introduced a bill called the
HUMANE Act, which would help us
begin to reduce the pull factors and im-
prove the way we process people who
seek asylum in the United States. The
HUMANE Act would close a major
loophole, the Flores settlement agree-
ment, which is often abused and ex-
ploited by the human smugglers. This
well-intentioned agreement was made
so unaccompanied alien children could
not be detained for more than 20 days,
but a flawed court ruling subsequent to
that imposed the same 20-day time
limit on families traveling together.
Let me tell you, the people who are
illegally entering our country are not
fools. They know our laws, and they
know how to get around them, as do
the people getting rich by moving peo-
ple from Central America across Mex-
ico into the United States—the human
smugglers.
These criminal enterprises know that
if individuals travel alone, they will be
detained and eventually returned to
their home country, especially if you
are a single adult. But if you are trav-
eling with a child, the situation
unfolds quite differently. After 20 days,
they are released from detention and
told to return for a court date that is
who knows how many months or years
in the future. Guess what. Many of
them disappear into the great Amer-
ican landscape and never show up for
their court date.
Of the more than 144,000 people who
illegally crossed our southern border
last month, 69 percent were either un-
accompanied children or part of a fam-
ily. We don’t know if these are legiti-
mate families or if a child is traveling
with a human smuggler or human traf-
ficker. What we do know is that chil-
dren are often abused or sexually as-
saulted on the way here, and many ar-
rive at our border in critical health. It
is our responsibility to protect all of
the children in our custody whether
they are alone, with a legitimate fam-
ily member, or with a criminal.
The HUMANE Act would clarify that
the 20-day limit would apply only to
those children. Family units would no
longer receive the same treatment,
which would deter criminals, smug-
glers, and traffickers from exploiting
children as a free ticket into the
United States. There simply has to be
some sort of deterrence, and the only
deterrence in this context is to detain
these individuals until they can appear
in front of an immigration judge and
make their claim for asylum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3275
June 10, 2019
The vast majority of claimants for
asylum are not ultimately successful,
but if they are released into the great
American countryside, they never show
up again for their court hearing and es-
sentially circumvent our laws and ex-
ploit those loopholes.
In addition, the HUMANE Act would
provide protections for children, such
as DNA tests, to ensure that they are
actually traveling with a biological
parent. It would prevent children from
being released into the custody of a sex
offender or a human trafficker.
I know these seem like commonsense
reforms, ones that could protect vul-
nerable children and ensure that our
laws are not abused and finally begin
to reinstate the integrity of our legal
immigration system. But that is not
what is happening right now in the ab-
sence of congressional action. There
are additional commonsense measures
in the HUMANE Act, such as stream-
lining the processing of migrants, add-
ing more Customs and Border Protec-
tion personnel, and training for those
who work with these migrant children.
As I said earlier, it is important to
note that this is the only bill that has
bipartisan support. It is not a sweeping
reform that will immediately fix every
problem along our border, but it is an
important place to start.
I believe there is more we need to do
here at home to stem the crisis, but
the truth is, we can’t do it alone. We
need to work with Central American
countries, where the vast majority of
these migrants are coming from, to
help them build stronger and safer gov-
ernments and countries. We can’t do it
for them, but we can help. We also need
additional support from our southern
neighbor, the country of Mexico.
I agree with President Trump that
Mexico must do more to prevent the
mass migration of Central Americans
traveling across their countries en
route to the United States. I commend
the President, the administration, and
the Mexican Government for working
together to come up with a solution
that will help stem the flow of mi-
grants at our southern border, as well
as avoid the costly economic mistake
of additional tariffs. The fact is, we can
achieve border security without com-
promising our economic security. The
two are not mutually exclusive.
Let me say that one more time. We
can achieve border security without
compromising our economic security.
The two are not mutually exclusive.
I am eager to continue our work in
Congress to improve our immigration
system in a way that prioritizes both
physical and economic security. I hope
our colleagues on the other side of the
aisle will join me and join us in that ef-
fort.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
[From the New York Times, June 9, 2019]
WHEN WILL CONGRESS GET SERIOUS ABOUT
THE SUFFERING AT THE BORDER?
IT’S TIME TO CUT THE SQUABBLING AND PASS AN
EMERGENCY RELIEF PACKAGE.
(By the Editorial Board)
Last week, as American and Mexican offi-
cials haggled over how to address the mi-
grant crisis at their countries’ shared border,
United States Customs and Border Protec-
tion released its monthly migration statis-
tics. They tell an alarming story.
In May, 144,278 migrants were taken into
custody. It was the third consecutive month
in which apprehensions topped 100,000 and
the highest one-month total in 13 years.
Unequipped to deal with the crush, border
facilities and migrant shelters are dan-
gerously overcrowded, and the staff is over-
burdened. Dysfunction, disease and even
death are a growing reality.
‘‘We are in a full-blown emergency, and I
cannot say this stronger: The system is bro-
ken,’’ the acting commissioner of Customs
and Border Protection, John Sanders, said.
Also last week, officials said that the Of-
fice of Refugee Resettlement, the agency as-
signed to care for unaccompanied migrant
children, would begin cutting services ‘‘not
directly necessary for the protection of life
and safety.’’ This includes English classes,
legal aid and recreational programs.
Democrats and other administration crit-
ics called the move ‘‘cruel’’ and ‘‘illegal,’’
but the financial reality is that the agency is
overwhelmed. So far this fiscal year, it has
taken charge of nearly 41,000 unaccompanied
children—a 57 percent increase over last
year. The entire program could run out of
funding by the end of June.
In short, it is time for Congress to stop
dithering and pass emergency funding to
deal with this nightmare.
It has been more than a month since the
administration sent Congress a request for
$4.5 billion in additional border assistance. A
large portion of the money, $3.3 billion, was
earmarked for humanitarian aid—which
most lawmakers agree is sorely needed. But
a relatively modest piece of the request
aimed at shoring up border security oper-
ations, roughly a quarter of the total, has
tied negotiators in knots.
Early on, Democrats were opposed to fund-
ing additional detention beds for Immigra-
tion and Customs Enforcement. Republicans
had problems with Democrats’ demands for
changes in the administration’s asylum poli-
cies. At one point, negotiators thought they
were close to resolving these conflicts, only
to have other issues snarl the process. Be-
yond the money for security, one of the re-
maining disagreements is how much data
sharing will be allowed between the agencies
responsible for caring for migrant children
and those that handle border enforcement.
The broader problem is that many Demo-
crats have come to view the Trump adminis-
tration as untrustworthy, and they are loath
to hand over one more penny for anything to
do with immigration. Members of the Con-
gressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congres-
sional Progressive Caucus have been particu-
larly adamant, insisting that their leader-
ship take a hard line in negotiations. In part,
they fear that the administration, despite its
promises, will spend any additional funding
on enforcement rather than humanitarian
needs.
There is much to despise about this admin-
istration’s immigration policies, which are
exacerbating this crisis, but there should be
no ambivalence about the urgency of ad-
dressing the humanitarian needs. While law-
makers wring their hands and drag their
feet, tens of thousands of migrant children
are suffering.
Congress needs to get serious about dealing
with that suffering.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.

BORDER SECURITY
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on Friday, the entire country got some
really good news: President Trump and
his administration secured an agree-
ment with the Government of Mexico.
Our neighbors to the south will be
doing more to secure their own borders
and to control the flow of people
through Mexico. These stepped-up ef-
forts should help relieve some of the
extraordinary pressure on the U.S.-
Mexico border.
This was an important step in tack-
ling the unacceptable and
unsustainable crisis—the crisis that
continues to roil our southern border.
Mexico has an important role to play
in solving the ongoing security and hu-
manitarian nightmare.
Americans were also happy to hear
the President’s announcement that, as
a result of this progress, our own fami-
lies and businesses will not need to ab-
sorb the cost of higher tariffs on im-
ports from Mexico. This would have
been a step backward for the U.S. econ-
omy generally, a new obstacle for
many of our manufacturers and small
businesses, and a pain that families
back home tell me often would hurt
them directly.
At its best, the U.S.-Mexico friend-
ship should combine strong mutual ef-
forts on security with a strong and
prosperous trading relationship. I am
glad that is the direction we seem to be
headed.
So this was an important step, but as
my Republican colleagues and I have
been sounding the alarm for months,
the magnitude of this border crisis
means that more will obviously be nec-
essary.
Our U.S. processing facilities are
badly strained beyond capacity as
record numbers of individuals and fam-
ilies continue to pour through.
The men and women of Customs and
Border Protection and our other agen-
cies on the border are juggling too
much, making do with too little and
having to triage resources away from
other important priorities so they can
keep up even the most basic security
functions and provide even the bare
minimum humanitarian assistance.
The administration is working over-
time on this. Now our Mexican friends
are stepping up as well. In short, about
the only important players who are
still refusing to take action are my

S3276 June 10, 2019
Democratic friends right here in Con-
gress.
Democrats in the House and the Sen-
ate have had no shortage of rhetoric on
the subject. They are very focused on
sounding concerned about this but thus
far have stood in the way of any ac-
tion.
It is not rocket science. The agencies
on the border that are confronting this
unprecedented crush of people need
more resources. They have explained
that to Congress as clearly as possible.
There is nothing remotely partisan
about this. A few weeks ago, even the
New York Times editorial board wrote:
As resources are strained and the system
buckles, the misery grows. Something needs
to be done. Soon.
That is the New York Times. Just
yesterday, they followed up with an-
other piece: ‘‘When Will Congress Get
Serious About the Suffering at the Bor-
der?’’
So for those scoring at home, Presi-
dent Trump and the New York Times
editorial board are actually on the
same side. It seems like everyone
across the country understands that we
should provide this funding—everyone
except Democrats here in Washington
who have become so addicted to pick-
ing political fights with the Trump ad-
ministration that they are letting even
their most basic responsibilities slip.
Well, I will have a lot more to say on
this subject in the days ahead. I think
everyone understands quite well that
my friends across the aisle are not per-
sonal fans of the President. We got
that.
I would suggest it is time to get over
it. The security of the United States
and the humanitarian conditions on
our border cannot afford to go under-
funded any longer just because Demo-
crats cannot bring themselves to give
this White House anything it asks for.
NOMINATIONS
Madam President, examples continue
to pour in about the big difference that
well-qualified individuals the Senate
has been confirming are making in
government service.
Last autumn, the Senate got the Se-
curities and Exchange Commission up
and running at full steam when we con-
firmed the fifth member. Just last
week, we saw the Commission take a
major step forward thanks to those
Commissioners and to the leadership of
Jay Clayton, its Chairman.
In the area of investor protections, as
with many other subjects, the legacy of
the Obama administration was messy
and ineffective.
President Obama’s Department of
Labor decided to unilaterally go even
further than Dodd-Frank in regulating
the advisers and broker-dealers who
sell to investors. The regulation they
put in place was a confusing, garbled
attempt at imposing a single, one-size-
fits-all standard on all kinds of busi-
nesses where it was not necessarily the
best approach. It was wrong on the
merits and, even apart from that, it
was implemented in a half-baked and
ineffective way.
Now Chairman Clayton and his col-
leagues are getting back on track. The
SEC has carefully crafted a tailored
new rule to make sure brokers really
act in the best interests of their cli-
ents. There are new standards for dis-
closing conflicts of interest, new stand-
ards for transparency in fees, and new
prohibitions against shady sales tac-
tics.
In short, the new rule seems to be a
case study in regulation done the right
way, a careful, prudent step that will
actually protect the American people.
This will not necessarily make front-
page news across the Nation but just
another example of the way we are lit-
erally turning the page on the Obama
administration’s failed policies and
taking a smarter, better direction for
the good of the country with out-
standing nominees and sound decision
making.
REMEMBERING DR. LLOYD JOHN OGILVIE
Madam President, on one final mat-
ter, last week, the Senate learned of
the passing of our longtime friend and
counselor, Dr. Lloyd John Ogilvie, who
was the 61st Chaplain of the U.S. Sen-
ate.
Dr. Ogilvie served as Chaplain for 8
years, beginning in 1995. His career in
ministry, teaching, and writing had al-
ready spanned four decades when Lloyd
agreed to come serve here.
He brought with him unceasing pa-
tience, an attentive ear, and genuine
concern for the thousands of Members,
staff, and families who made up his
Senate flock.
The Senate and the Nation saw trag-
edy during Lloyd’s tenure. We mourned
the death of three colleagues in office;
we endured an attack on this building
that left two Capitol Police officers
dead; we faced September 11 and its
aftermath; we weathered the anthrax
scare; and, of course, those to whom he
ministered also faced their own pri-
vate, personal challenges during that
time.
On all of these matters, so many peo-
ple sought guidance, comfort, and
counsel from Lloyd, and every single
day, he provided it—a joyful, con-
sistent, straightforward messenger and
example of God’s love.
He delivered daily prayers with kind-
ly wisdom. He offered common ground
in Bible study. He checked in on
spouses, children, and staff, and he did
it all while immaculately dressed with
that deep, ringing voice. He was the
complete package—a Scot, a Mid-
westerner, and briefly a Washing-
tonian, all in one.
After Dr. Ogilvie moved on in 2003, he
moved to Fuller Seminary and estab-
lished a center for preaching which
bears his name. I am glad his legacy
will continue to ripple out into new
generations of spiritual leaders who
will learn from his singular example.
So today the prayers of the Senate
are with Lloyd’s family. We are grate-
ful for his lifelong ministry and espe-
cially for the fact that it brought him
here.
One day early in his tenure, Dr.
Ogilvie convened the Senate by asking
God ‘‘to hope through us today.’’ He
prayed: ‘‘Make us people who are a lift
and not a load, a blessing and not a
burden.’’ Today the many people whose
lives he lifted up are remembering just
how blessed we were by his friendship
and how blessed we are by his example.

BASHAM
Mr. ROUNDS. Madam President, I
rise today to recognize Lt. Gen. Steve
Basham, who recently departed his po-
sition as Director of Air Force Legisla-
tive Liaison and assumes his new du-
ties as Deputy Commander of the U.S.
Air Forces in Europe and Air Forces in
Africa.
As the Director of Legislative Affairs
of the Air Force, Lieutenant General
Basham worked directly with the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives
on all aspects of organizing, training,
and equipping our airmen to project
global combat power abroad. Through-
out this time, then-Major General
Basham prepared the Secretary and the
Chief of Staff of the Air Force, as well
as other senior Air Force leaders, for
engagements on Capitol Hill, to in-
clude extensive testimony before con-
gressional committees.

June 10, 2019
A product of some of these strategic
engagements was the decision to select
Ellsworth Air Force Base as the first
unit to host the B–21 Raider bomber, a
strategic decision that I personally
thank the Secretary of the Air Force
for making. I also thank Lieutenant
General Basham for his steadfast ef-
forts in the deliberate decision-making
process.
In 1989, following his graduation from
Western Kentucky University, Lieuten-
ant General Basham was commissioned
through Air Force Officer Training
School and achieved his flying wings.
Over the course of his distinguished ca-
reer, he has attained a command pilot
rating with more than 3,400 flying
hours in the T–37, T–38, B–1, B–2, and
B–52 aircraft. He holds the honor of
being one of the first four pilots to fly
the B–2 stealth bomber in combat.
Throughout his career, Lieutenant
General Basham has held numerous
other positions of strategic impor-
tance, including Deputy Director of Re-
quirements for the Joint Staff at the
Pentagon and as the Director of Strat-
egy, Plans, and Programs for Head-
quarters Pacific Air Forces at Joint
Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii.
Of course, none of this could be done
without the support of his wife Angie
and their two daughters, Lauren and
Sarah.
On behalf of the U.S. Congress and a
grateful Nation, I extend our deepest
appreciation to Lt. Gen. Steven L.
Basham and his family for their dedi-
cated service to the Air Force and to
our Nation. We wish them all the best
as they move on to his next assignment
and continue working to keep our Na-
tion and our allies safe from potential
Russian aggression in Europe, as well
as violent extremists in Africa.
There is no question that the Air
Force, the Department of Defense, and
the United States will continue to ben-
efit greatly from Lieutenant General
Basham’s outstanding leadership.

HELICOPTER CRASH
Mr. SCHUMER. First, Madam Presi-
dent, on my way coming down to Wash-
ington, I heard that a helicopter
crashed onto the roof of a building on
Seventh Avenue in my hometown of
New York City. We are still learning
the circumstances of the crash and the
extent of the damage, the injuries and
casualty it may have caused. But, as
all of America saw after 9/11, the Fire
Department of New York and the Po-
lice Department of New York are truly
some of the very, very best we have.
They are strong, they are brave, they
are smart, and I have every faith they
will do their duty to protect New York-
ers and make sure everyone is safe.
BORDER SECURITY
Madam President, on another sub-
ject—the border—the President ulti-
mately, of course, backed off his threat
of tariffs against Mexico, but really,
anyone who has observed the Presi-
dent’s foreign policy efforts could have
predicted how this would play out. It is
a pretty simple pattern. The President
stakes out a maximalist position but
never clearly defines his objectives.
That way, after he backs himself into a
corner, he can use a deal of any kind,
even if it is merely a fig leaf, to justify
retreating from whatever misguided
policy he has threatened. Then he de-
clares victory, having done little or
nothing to solve the underlying prob-
lem.
Well, that is exactly what happened
right here. According to public reports,
the agreement President Trump
reached with Mexico contains policies
negotiated months ago—nothing more
than warmed-up leftovers—and then
today, after the President tweeted that
we have ‘‘a fully signed and docu-
mented . . . Immigration and Security
deal with Mexico,’’ the Mexican For-
eign Minister said that no secret deal
exists. He clarified that the only agree-
ment reached was to revisit the issue
in the future. This is the headline of
the New York Times: ‘‘No Secret Immi-
gration Deal Exists With U.S., Mexico’s
Foreign Minister Says.’’ It is amazing
how this President will just make stuff
up—there is an ‘‘L’’ word here—he just
makes it up, and then it is refuted.
So, to recap, in February, the Presi-
dent declared a bogus emergency to
build a wall he said would solve the
problem. Then he made a bogus threat
to shut down the border completely,
which, of course, never materialized.
Then he made a bogus threat to impose
tariffs, which the business community
and Republicans in Congress rejected.
And now the President claims a bogus
agreement with Mexico, which con-
tains policies Mexico volunteered to do
months ago. Bogus, bogus, bogus.
It is no wonder our problems don’t go
away in this country because of the
way the President does things both on
the domestic front and the foreign pol-
icy front. What he did here is typical of
the President’s game-show foreign pol-
icy: a big production without very
much progress. He generates a lot of
coverage and attention around big
summits, photo-ops, scare tactics, and
belligerent threats, but because the
President doesn’t set clear goals, be-
cause the President doesn’t have a de-
fined strategy about how to achieve
them, and because he is impatient to
always declare victory prematurely
even when it doesn’t occur, his negotia-
tions with foreign countries are inef-
fective.
We saw this play out in North Korea
last June. The President returned from
his meeting with Chairman KIM and
tweeted: ‘‘There is no longer a nuclear
threat from North Korea.’’ One year
later, North Korea continues to con-
duct weapons tests. We are seeing it
play out now with Mexico, which has
not agreed to anything new. And I am
deeply concerned the same pattern
may play out with China—perhaps the
most serious of them all.
We have a once-in-a-generation op-
portunity to reform China’s economic
relations with the world. But despite
the President’s success in getting
China to the table—and he has with the
tariffs—the President has never clearly
defined what an effective agreement
with China looks like. So I am afraid
that, in the end, just like he did with
Mexico, the President could retreat
from his position on China in exchange
for a face-saving deal that doesn’t ac-
complish much of anything. I hope and
pray that is not the case. I hope and
pray he stands strong because the state
of the future of jobs in America, of
businesses in America, and of wealth in
America is at stake.
For the sake of all of those things, I
hope that, unlike this charade with
Mexico, President Trump is willing to
stay the course on China and not come
up with another bogus solution that
doesn’t solve any problem.
One final point on this matter, and a
very important point, and I hope every-
one will listen because we have talked
about this in the last week or two, but
so far, the media hasn’t written much
about it. I hope they will today.
President Trump tweeted this morn-
ing that Democrats have no plan to
deal with the surge of migrants at the
border. That is another bogus claim.
Democrats do have a plan. We proposed
it, actually, last year. I have talked
about it here on the floor of the Senate
two or three times in the last 2 weeks,
and it would be far more effective at
dealing with the actual problem than
what President Trump announced on
Friday. Let me outline the three things
in our plan.
First, we would allow asylum seekers
to apply for asylum within their own
countries.
If you are a Guatemalan, a Honduran,
or an El Salvadoran, your child is
threatened with being beat up, brutal-
ized, or killed by gangs, and your
daughter is threatened with rape, you
want to leave the country. But it is a
long, dangerous trek to go across Mex-
ico. You have to pay the coyotes a lot
of money.
Let them apply for asylum in their
home countries, not at the border with
the United States.
Second, we would provide security
assistance to Central American coun-
tries to crack down on the violent
gangs and the drug cartels and the
human trafficking. That is what most
of these people are fleeing. If you look
at their pictures, most all of them are
not criminals. They are not gang mem-
bers. They are average people seeking
desperate relief.

S3278 June 10, 2019
What we could do to stem the tide—
and it wouldn’t cost that much—is
crack down on violent gangs, drug car-
tels, and trafficking. President Obama
began to do this, and President Trump
has rescinded it. It is logical, and it
could work. These countries don’t have
our knowledge, our ability, or our re-
sources to go after these horrible gangs
and these horrible drug dealers, but we
can help them. We should.
Third, here at our border, we could
increase the number of immigration
judges to process the cases faster so
people wouldn’t have to wait so long.
Their case could be adjudicated. If they
meet the asylum requirements, fine,
and if they don’t, they don’t get in.
Those are three commonsense solu-
tions to the problem that President
Trump has talked about. As the Presi-
dent’s illusory deal with Mexico con-
tinues to unravel, as the situation
doesn’t get better, please—there are
Republicans on the other side of the
aisle who agree with this solution.
Please, Mr. President, look at this so-
lution. It can work. It can be bipar-
tisan. No, you don’t get to pound the
table and make a lot of demands that
won’t ever affect anything, but it
might get the job done. Let’s give it a
shot in a bipartisan way.
ELECTION SECURITY
Madam President, finally, on elec-
tion security and my friend the Repub-
lican leader’s graveyard, which con-
tinues to grow, ever since the Demo-
crats won the majority in the House of
Representatives, Leader MCCONNELL
has hardly considered legislation on
the floor of the Senate. Instead of
bringing up bills passed by the House,
Leader MCCONNELL has turned the Sen-
ate, as now widely quoted and known,
into a legislative graveyard where
pretty much the only thing we debate
around here is nominations. It is frus-
trating not just to Democrats but to
Americans. They say: Can’t we get
something done for the country? And it
is frustrating, I am sure, for my Repub-
lican friends who didn’t come here just
to rubberstamp nominees.
One of my biggest frustrations about
Leader MCCONNELL’s legislative grave-
yard is that even on the nonpartisan
issues, there is virtually no movement.
Take election security. We all know—
on a good day, even President Trump
agrees—the Russians interfered in our
elections in 2016. That is
uncontroverted. Senior intelligence of-
ficials and Director Wray, the head of
the FBI—well-regarded and appointed
by the President—issued multiple
warnings that foreign powers will try
to interfere in our elections again in
2020.
We have to make sure our election
systems are resilient and our cyber de-
fenses are up to date. There is nothing
partisan about that. When a foreign
country can twist an American elec-
tion one way or the other, that eats at
the wellspring of our democracy. We
shouldn’t allow it. So why, when there
is bipartisan legislation, is Leader
MCCONNELL just sitting on his hands
and refusing to bring it up? He is not
moving any legislation having to do
with election security—Democrat, Re-
publican, or, best of all, bipartisan. We
have multiple bipartisan bills that
would harden our election infrastruc-
ture and punish any adversary that
tries to interfere in our elections. Why
will Leader MCCONNELL not bring them
to the floor?
Now, I am certainly glad that he has
agreed to my request to at least hold a
secure briefing on the risks we face in
the next election. I am looking forward
to a date soon. I hope the leader will
update us all on when it might be
scheduled. It should be ASAP. This is
serious stuff. The Founding Fathers
were worried about foreign interference
in our elections, and in our modern dig-
ital world it has taken a new, new dan-
gerous turn.
But a briefing alone isn’t enough. We
have to take legislative action. Demo-
crats and Republicans, we all know,
disagree on a whole lot of issues, but
surely we can all agree that nothing
matters more in our democracy than
defending the integrity of our elec-
tions, and I hope that we as a body can
take bipartisan action soon.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the
order for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
247TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ‘‘GASPEE’’ RAID
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I come to the floor of the Senate
today, as I do every year at this time,
to remember what Rhode Island aboli-
tionist Frances Whipple McDougall
called ‘‘the first blood [drawn] in the
Revolution.’’ This past Sunday marked
the 247th anniversary of the Gaspee
raid.
This is an image of what happened to
the Gaspee. We ought to remember.
Most Americans do not know about the
Gaspee Affair. They have learned about
a far tamer incident in Boston Harbor
a year later, when some tipsy Bosto-
nians toppled bales of tea into the
water.
I get why Bostonians are proud of
their tea party. It is a decent story
that tea was ruined, the British East
India Company was out some money,
the Crown got angry, and the American
patriots gained notoriety and momen-
tum for our cause.
But the Gaspee raid offers so much
more—a true villain, a daring escape, a
vigorous call to action, the storming of
a ship, the vanquishing of an enemy, a
blast in the night, and an earlier stir-
ring of revolutionary spirit.
The story begins in the 1760s, with
King George and the English Par-
liament trying to raise money. The
Crown needed to recoup losses from ex-
pensive recent wars, and the Colonies
seemed like a convenient place to turn.
Their solution was to allow the power-
ful British Navy to enforce customs
laws, transforming naval officers into
well-armed tax collectors.
The Admiralty commissioned sloops
and schooners to troll the Colonies’
most profitable waters for tax revenue.
In Narragansett Bay the Crown sent
Lieutenant William Dudingston in an
eight-gun schooner, the Gaspee. The
boat and its captain quickly earned a
nasty reputation. Dudingston stopped
virtually every vessel in sight, from
the biggest schooners to the smallest
packet boats. He harassed sailors,
seized cargo, and annexed Rhode Island
vessels, merchants, and watermen,
often on shaky or nonexistent charges.
Historian George Washington Greene,
a Rhode Islander and grandson of
Rhode Island’s legendary Revolu-
tionary War hero, Major General Na-
thaniel Greene, described Dudingston’s
conduct this way:
Not contented with performing the duties
of his office, still vexatious even when con-
siderately executed, he multiplied its annoy-
ances by a thousand acts of petty tyranny.
He stopped vessels of every kind without dis-
crimination—ships just from sea and market
boats on their way to Providence and New-
port with their perishable freights, and to in-
crease the indignity refused to show his com-
mission or the authority by which he acted.
A further insult, Dudingston sent
prisoners and cargo to Boston to face
justice before a British tribunal, not
the Rhode Island court established in
Newport. This violated the Colony’s
agreement with the Crown to adju-
dicate such disputes on Rhode Island’s
soil, an offense to our Colony’s sov-
ereignty.
From winter to spring of 1772, ten-
sions in Narragansett Bay rose. Among
the incidents involving the loathed
Gaspee, Dudingston commandeered For-
tune, the ship belonging to the influen-
tial merchant and later Revolutionary
War hero, Nathaniel Greene. Rhode Is-
lander Daniel Harrington notes in a
2017 Providence Journal article that
‘‘the patriotic fervor’’ that had swept
‘‘the colonies [had] seemed to elude
[Greene]—until Dudingston snagged his
Fortune and ignited the righteous spirit
of resentment.’’
When Greene later led the Conti-
nental Army’s successful Southern
Campaign, British General Cornwallis
would lament: ‘‘That damned Greene is
more dangerous than Washington.’’
The ignited spirit was a forceful one.
On June 9, 1772, the coastal trader
Hannah caught Lieutenant
Dudingston’s eye as she sailed up Nar-
ragansett Bay en route to Providence.
The Gaspee pursued the Hannah and or-
dered her to stop for inspection. The
Hannah refused. The Gaspee fired a
warning shot. The Hannah sailed on.
Off Warwick’s shore, near Pawtuxet
Village, things came to a head. Accord-
ing to the account of Rhode Islander
Ephraim Bowen, the Hannah’s skipper,
Benjamin Lindsey, sailed his lighter
boat over shallows around Namquid

Point. Dudingston followed in chase
taking his Gaspee, a heavier boat, into
waters too shallow for it. The Gaspee
ran aground in a falling tide.
The Hannah sped on to Providence.
Captain Lindsey alerted respected local
merchant John Brown, later a founder
of Brown University. Brown ‘‘imme-
diately concluded that [the Gaspee]
would remain immovable until after
midnight,’’ Ephraim Bowen recalls, and
saw what he calls the ‘‘opportunity of-
fered of putting an end to the trouble
and vexation she daily caused.’’
A Providence man named Daniel
Pearce ‘‘passed along the main street,
beating a drum and informing the in-
habitants of the fact that the Gaspee
was aground on Namquid Point and
would not float until 3 o’clock the next
morning,’’ Bowen recalled. Pearce in-
vited ‘‘those persons who felt a disposi-
tion to go and destroy that trouble-
some vessel to repair in the evening to
Mr. James Sabin’s house,’’ presumably
for some strong spirits and discussion
of an attack.
Once assembled and refreshed, the
Rhode Islanders set off into a moonless
night in eight longboats with muffled
oars. The group’s ‘‘powder was pre-
pared and bullets run’’ as it ‘‘set forth
on its mission of vengeance,’’ George
Washington Green recorded.
Aboard the Gaspee, the seaman stand-
ing watch, Bartholomew Cheever, first
thought he saw light dancing off rocks
in the near-blackness. Suddenly, how-
ever, Cheever realized the glints he saw
were more than rocks. The Rhode Is-
landers and their long boats encircled
the Gaspee. Cheever alerted
Dudingston, and Dudingston ordered
his men to fire on the assault party.
The Rhode Islanders, however, out-
numbered the British crew by more
than 4 to 1 and quickly overwhelmed
the Gaspee. A brief and decisive melee
ensued. Soon, Dudingston lay on the
quarterdeck with musket wounds to
his arm and groin. The Gaspee would
never again be under British command.
The Rhode Islanders ferried the Brit-
ish crew to shore, where they were
awaited by the Pawtuxet Rangers, a
group that exists still today. The raid-
ers then returned once more to set fire
to the Gaspee. The fire burned until it
reached the powder magazines below
the Gaspee’s decks, and when the fire
reached the magazines, the Gaspee was
blown to bits and was no more.
King George soon learned of the
Gaspee raid and was not pleased. The
raiders would face charges of treason,
he said, and the gallows, were they to
be found guilty and convicted. The
Crown put up the colossal reward of 500
pounds sterling for the capture of the
rebels—50 times what a colonial farmer
would earn in a year.
No Rhode Islander would give up the
raiders. Try as they might, British au-
thorities never found and never con-
victed the brave raiders who burned
the Gaspee. Word of the Gaspee raid
spread swiftly through the Colonies
and stirred revolutionary spirit.
George Washington was actually
hosting a British officer when he heard
the story. The officer exclaimed that
the Rhode Islanders ought to be
‘‘phlebotomized’’ and that he would
personally march 5,000 British regulars
‘‘from Boston to Charleston, South
Carolina, and put down all opposition
to the revenue acts.’’ To that assertion,
Washington shot back:
I question not, Sir, that you could march
from Boston into Charleston, South Caro-
lina, at the head of 5,000 British regulars; but
do you mean to say, Sir, that you could do
so, as a friend, or as an enemy? If as the lat-
ter, and you will allow me a few weeks’ no-
tice of your intention, I will engage to give
you a handsome check with the Virginia ri-
flemen alone.
Washington punctuated his retort, as
an onlooker reported, by ‘‘[striking]
the table so violently with his clenched
hand that some wine glasses and a de-
canter near him with difficulty main-
tained their upright positions.’’
Every year, Rhode Islanders gather
for a celebration and parade through
Warwick, the neighborhood off of
which this event took place. We gather
to remember the daring assault on the
Gaspee. We recall our forebears’ resolve
for independence, freedom of religion,
and the rule of law. We are also glad to
remember that Rhode Islanders are not
to be trifled with. This is a story worth
remembering.
Thank you.

TRIBUTE TO REAR ADMIRAL
JAMES T. LOEBLEIN
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I
wish to recognize and congratulate
RADM James T. Loeblein of the U.S.
Navy on his outstanding service to our
Nation as the Navy’s Chief of Legisla-
tive Affairs from January 2017 to July
2019. During these 2 years, a period best
described as one of constant change, he
deftly led his team to execute with a
lasting legacy of ‘‘precision and style.’’
Jim Loeblein was the Navy’s lead ad-
vocate on Capitol Hill and had the
challenging job of communicating with
all 535 Members of Congress. He
expertly handled our constituent in-
quiries and represented the Navy while
balancing military, political, and budg-
etary priorities. His naval service is a
lasting reminder that the United
States remains the strongest maritime
nation.
Rear Admiral Loeblein selflessly de-
voted the last 2 and a half years of his
naval service ensuring our Nation’s
sailors were taken care of and rep-
resented faithfully in Congress. Spe-
cifically, Jim brilliantly led the re-
sponse to the salient issues of this pe-
riod: aircraft carrier purchases and
overhauls, submarine procurement
timelines, the rise of cyber warfare, the
quality of on-base military housing—
and the list goes on. Jim excelled in
this role with his hallmark ‘‘precision
and style.’’
Because of Jim’s professionalism and
friendly personality, he established
warm and lasting relationships with
our colleagues, garnering respect and
admiration in both Chambers of Con-
gress and on both sides of the aisle. He
worked with us to broaden the Navy’s
outreach beyond those members of de-
fense committees. Jim’s efforts, along
with those of the Chief of Naval Oper-
ations, introduced the Navy to Sen-
ators who would not otherwise have
had exposure to the great work our
sailors are doing around the globe.
On behalf of my colleagues and the
entire U.S. Senate, I want to person-
ally thank RADM Jim Loeblein for his
more than three decades of dedicated
service to the Navy and our nation. He
will be certainly missed. I also want to
thank his wife Carol for her sacrifice
during her own time in the Navy and
for her continued, tremendous support
to her husband. I wish them fair winds
and following seas in his post-naval ca-
reer, and I sincerely look forward to
seeing him again in the future.

TRIBUTE TO RITA MEYER
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, this
week in Wyoming, one of our finest
will be recognized by the Wyoming
GOP for a lifetime of service and lead-
ership. I am privileged to tell my col-
leagues about Rita Meyer.
Rita honorably served our great
country for more than 23 years in the
U.S. military. She served as an enlisted
airwoman before becoming an officer in
the Wyoming Air National Guard. Rita
is a combat veteran of both Operation
Desert Storm and Operation Enduring
Freedom. In 1995, the Air National
Guard brought Rita to D.C. to act as
the strategic planning officer for the
National Guard Bureau’s counterdrug
directorate.
Upon returning to Wyoming, Rita
was appointed full-time comptroller for
the Wyoming Air National Guard. Al-
though eligible to retire from National
Guard service in 2004, Rita answered
the call and volunteered for an Active-
Duty command in Southwest Asia. She
was selected to serve as the 455th Air-
lift Wing Expeditionary Mission Sup-
port Group commander at Bagram Air-
field, Afghanistan. She completed her
tour in May 2005.
Having attained the rank of full colo-
nel, Rita retired from her incredibly
distinguished military career in No-
vember of 2007. Colonel Meyer was rec-
ognized for going above and beyond
during her service by being awarded
with the Legion of Merit, the Order of
the Bayonet, and the Order of St. Bar-
bara.
Although retired from the service,
Rita would continue to give back to
the Armed Forces. Colonel Meyer
served as a member of my service acad-
emy nomination board. She also served
as head of former Senator Malcolm
Wallop’s board. I can attest to how
vital volunteers like Rita are to the
process of nominating young men and
women of Wyoming to West Point and
the U.S. Naval, Merchant Marine, and
Air Force Academies.
In addition to an outstanding mili-
tary career, Rita is an exemplary
scholar. Rita earned two degrees from
the University of Wyoming: a bachelor
of arts in education and a bachelor of
science in finance. She later earned a
master of business administration in
international business from Regis Uni-
versity, as well as a master’s in na-
tional resource strategy from the Na-
tional Defense University in Wash-
ington, DC.
Ultimately, the University of Wyo-
ming would recognize Rita as out-
standing alumnus in both colleges of
business and education. It was also at
the University of Wyoming in Laramie
that Rita was appointed to the board of
trustees.
Rita’s distinguished career continued
as chief of staff for Governor Jim
Geringer. She was later elected as the
State auditor in 2006 and served until
2011.
Building on her career in the mili-
tary and State government, Rita took
the lead of the largest public utility in
Wyoming as vice-president-Wyoming
for Rocky Mountain Power. As the
company’s only executive based in Wy-
oming, Rita oversees the utility’s
State business plan, customer service,
and community relations. Rita’s expe-
rience as a statesman proved to be val-
uable as she helps the company navi-
gate regulatory and legislative issues.
As Wyoming faces challenges in the
ever-changing energy industry, we are
fortunate to have a proven leader like
Rita fighting for solutions.
While being incredibly busy in her
life as a citizen soldier, public servant,
and later as a corporate executive, Rita
never let that get in the way of being
a committed wife and mother. Rita
married dentist Dr. Charles Meyer, a
Rawlins, WY, native in 1977. Dr. Meyer
served as a navy corpsman in the Sol-
omon Islands during WWII. He passed
away in 2011 after a long and distin-
guished career as a leader in dental
health and education. Charlie and Rita
were blessed with a son, Charles, Jr.,
who followed in his parent’s footsteps
by serving as an officer in the U.S.
Navy. Charlie, his wife Jen, and their
two children, Augusta Grace and John
Charles, live in Maryland.
Rita is married to Stephen J. Miller
of SJ Miller Associates in Cheyenne.
Stephen, a senior private investigator
with more than 35 years of experience
in law enforcement, has a master’s de-
gree in public administration from the
University of Wyoming.
Wyoming has benefited immensely
from Rita Meyer’s wisdom and leader-
ship. We continue to look to Rita as
the voice for veterans and civilians
alike. My wife Bobbi and I are proud to
have Rita as our friend, and folks all
over Wyoming are fortunate because
Rita set such a great example for gen-
erations to come.

TRIBUTE TO JIM KURTH
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President,
today I wish to recognize Jim Kurth
for his 41 years of public service and
congratulate him on his recent retire-
ment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3282 June 10, 2019
On May 7, 1978, Mr. James Kurth was
hired by the U.S. Forest Service as a
biological technician having recently
graduated with a degree in wildlife
management from the University of
Wisconsin-Stevens Point. On Friday,
May 31, Jim retired from public serv-
ice, after a 41-year career, working
mainly with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service. He ended his career after serv-
ing more than 4 years as the agency’s
deputy director for operations.
Jim’s story is an inspiring example of
dedication to the vital mission of the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. He grew
up in Columbus, OH. He married his
high school sweetheart. He picked a ca-
reer in public service, quickly finding
his way to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, and moving his family across
the country as he accepted positions at
Mississippi Sandhill Crane National
Wildlife Refuge, Arthur R. Marshall
Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge
in Florida, Bogue Chitto National
Wildlife Refuge in Louisiana, Seney
National Wildlife Refuge in Michigan,
and Ninigret National Wildlife Refuge
in Rhode Island. From there, he
jumped to Alaska where he became
manager of the Arctic National Wild-
life Refuge, the Nation’s largest pro-
tected land area at nearly 20 million
acres.
He left Alaska in 1999 and journeyed
to the Nation’s Capital, to take the po-
sition of deputy chief of the National
Wildlife Refuge System, the world’s
largest system of protected lands and
waters, including Maryland’s
Blackwater, Eastern Neck, and Patux-
ent National Wildlife Refuges. He
served as deputy chief for 11 years and
then chief for nearly 4 years before ac-
cepting the job as the Service’s deputy
director in 2015.
Former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serv-
ice Director Dan Ashe said, ‘‘Jim
served as my Deputy twice. Once when
I was Refuge Chief, and again when I
was Director. He was fond of saying,
‘It’s better to have a Deputy than be a
Deputy’ but Jim was much more. He
was a friend and mentor. The kind of
person who would tell you what you
needed to hear, not what you wanted to
hear. His strength is his character and
deep and authentic concern for the peo-
ple who do the organization’s work.’’ A
culture of character and integrity in an
organization like the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service grows through the ex-
amples of principled conduct from
those in positions of authority.
For 41 years, Jim Kurth served the
American people. His legacy is in the
legions of people whom he has
mentored and in the millions of acres
of habitat he has helped conserve for
wildlife and for people.
On May 31, 2019, Jim Kurth retired
from public service. We are better as a
nation for his service, and we take a
moment to celebrate his career and his
example of public service.
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO JOHN STILLMON
WILLIS, JR.
∑ Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise
today in celebration of First Lieuten-
ant John Stillmon Willis, Jr.’s 100th
birthday and to speak on his extraor-
dinary life and accomplishments. Mr.
Willis has served his Nation honorably,
and put his life on the line for the val-
ues that we hold dear as Americans.
For this, we are forever grateful.
Mr. Willis was born on June 2, 1919,
and was raised in Doyline, LA. He at-
tended Louisiana State University
from 1937–1940 and graduated with a de-
gree in agronomy. Shortly after the
bombing of Pearl Harbor, Mr. Willis, a
member in the army infantry reserve
as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army, vol-
unteered for pilot training. He was
then transferred to the Army Air
Corps, in grade, as a second lieutenant,
and assigned to the 452nd Bomb group
in Deopham Green Airbase in
Atleborough in Norfolk, England.
While there, he piloted a B–17 Flying
Fortress and hit strategic targets in
Germany and supported ground forces
across Europe after the D-Day inva-
sion. He would later be promoted to
first lieutenant. After the fighting
stopped, Mr. Willis credited the sur-
vival of his crew and himself to the
fact that the ‘‘good Lord has his arms
around them.’’
After the war, he worked in his fa-
ther’s lumber business for 20 years. Mr.
Willis would go on to marry Lillian
Mae Life and have one daughter, Mar-
tha Lou Willis, who gave them 3 grand-
children. The Willises enjoyed a beau-
tiful 54 year marriage. Mr. Willis
worked for another 20 years at his fa-
ther-in-law’s business, Webb Hardware,
in Minden, LA. Mr. Willis recently
celebrated his 100th birthday at St.
John’s Episcopal Church in Minden,
where he has been a lifelong member.
It is because of his long list of accom-
plishments and beautiful life that we
celebrate First Lieutenant John
Stillmon Willis Jr.’s 100th birthday. We
honor and thank him for a lifetime of
service to our State and country and
wish him the happiest of birthdays.∑
f
RECOGNIZING BOYD CYCLING
∑ Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, as a mem-
ber of U.S. Senate Committee on Small
Business and Entrepreneurship, it is
my honor to recognize a unique small
business for its tremendous contribu-
tions to the local economy. Small busi-
nesses drive our Nation’s economic ex-
pansion, generate lasting job growth,
and encourage community develop-
ment. This week, it is my honor to rec-
ognize Boyd Cycling of Greenville, SC,
as the Senate Small Business of the
Week.
Boyd Johnson, a former competitive
cyclist, originally founded Boyd Cy-
cling under the name Boyd Bikes in
September of 2009. Charged by a mis-
sion of quality and service, Boyd set
out to produce and sell various bike
products in the Greenville area. About
3 months into the operation, Boyd’s
Bikes began to grow dramatically, and
Boyd’s wife Nicole joined as a partner
of the business. Boyd and Nicole are a
prime example of how a leap of faith,
coupled with hard work, can pay off.
Boyd Bikes initially offered wheels,
bike frames, handlebars, and other ac-
cessories, but the Johnsons quickly re-
alized that their competitive advan-
tage was their handcrafted wheels
made out of carbon fiber and alloy. By
2011, Boyd and Nicole decided to focus
directly on specializing in bike wheels
and changed the name of the business
to Boyd Cycling.
In addition to focusing on bike
wheels, Boyd and Nicole decided to
shake up their business model. Origi-
nally, Boyd Cycling focused primarily
on direct-to-consumer sales. Wanting
to expand their business, Boyd and Ni-
cole reached out to the Spartanburg
Area Small Business Development Cen-
ter, SBDC, a resource partner of the
U.S. Small Business Administration,
and received business counseling and
exporting advice. Eventually, Boyd Cy-
cling began selling their products to
bike shops around the country in addi-
tion to their own website. By staying
committed to high quality and low
pricing, the Johnsons have been able to
avoid undercutting their retail clients
while diversifying their income stream.
In turn, this has enabled them to ex-
port their products globally and now
currently distribute to over 15 coun-
tries.
A seasoned cyclist, Boyd spends time
carefully designing each product the
company offers. Once a product is de-
veloped, Boyd Cycling contracts manu-
facturing out to different firms domes-
tically and internationally. Boyd main-
tains rigorous standards when con-
tracting with every manufacturing
firm that the company uses, making
sure to implement quality controls on
materials and construction methods.
Boyd Cycling’s dedication to quality
has not gone unnoticed. They have re-
ceived national media coverage, excel-
lent customer reviews, and numerous
awards. In 2017 and 2019, Boyd and Ni-
cole were named the U.S. Small Busi-
ness Administration’s Exporter of the
Year for South Carolina. This award
recognizes small business owners for
their success and commitment to ex-
porting goods or services. Boyd Cycling
also supports various philanthropies in
their community including Meals on
Wheels, the Alzheimers Foundation,
the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society,
Miracle Hill, Upstate Forever, and
Global Bike. Their community involve-
ment has been a key to their success as
Greenville has become a bustling hub
for the recreational biking community.
Boyd and Nicole truly embody the
entrepreneurial and community spirit.
From its humble beginnings, Boyd has
grown into a respectable player in the
industry while maintaining a commit-
ment to customer service and product

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr.
COONS, Mr. ROBERTS, Ms.
DUCKWORTH, Mr. SULLIVAN, Mr.
VAN HOLLEN, Mrs. CAPITO, Mr.
MARKEY, Mr. ISAKSON, Mr.
MERKLEY, Mr. MORAN, Mr.
CARDIN, Mr. CORNYN, Ms.
ROSEN, Mr. YOUNG, Ms. STABE-
NOW, Mr. ENZI, Mr. WYDEN, Mr.
CRAMER, Mr. MURPHY, Mr.
RUBIO, and Mr. REED):
S. 1766. A bill to implement policies
to end preventable maternal, newborn,
and child deaths globally; to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise
this evening to introduce legislation
with my friend and colleague from
Delaware, Senator CHRIS COONS, called
the Reach Every Mother and Child Act
of 2019. I am delighted to say that we
have 22 bipartisan cosponsors for our
initiative. Our legislation would make
it the policy of the United States to
lead an effort to end preventable
deaths of mothers, newborns, and
young children in the developing world
by the year 2030.
Due in part to American leadership
and generosity, many lives have al-
ready been saved. Since 1990, the an-
nual number of deaths of children
under the age of 5 has been cut in half.
Nevertheless, far too many mothers,
newborns, and young children under
the age of 5 still succumb to disease
and malnutrition that could easily
have been prevented.
Every day, approximately 800 women
die from preventable causes that are
related to pregnancy and childbirth. In
addition, more than 15,000 children
under the age of 5 die every day from
treatable conditions, such as pre-
maturity, pneumonia, and diarrhea,
with malnutrition being the underlying
cause in nearly half of those deaths.
Our bill aims to reach these mothers
and children with simple, proven, cost-
effective interventions that we know
will help them survive. A concentrated
effort could end preventable maternal
and child deaths worldwide by the year
2030. However, continued American
leadership and support from the inter-
national community are critical to
success.
To achieve this ambitious goal, our
bill would require the implementation
of a strategy to scale up the most effec-
tive interventions to save as many
lives as possible. This idea is central to
our bill. We do not have to guess at
what interventions will work. The re-
ality is that more than 15,000 children
die each day of conditions that we
know how to treat right now. These
lifesaving interventions include clean
birthing practices, vaccines, nutri-
tional supplements, handwashing with
soap, and other basic needs that re-
main elusive for far too many women
and children in developing countries.
This is what must change.
In addition, our bill would establish a
Maternal and Child Survival Coordi-
nator at the USAID, who would focus
on implementing the 5-year strategy
and verifying that the most effective
interventions are being scaled up in
target countries.
The bill would improve government
efficiency across several agencies that
would collaborate with the Coordinator
to identify and promote the most effec-
tive treatments to end preventable ma-
ternal and child deaths globally. To
promote transparency and greater ac-
countability, our bill would also re-
quire detailed public reporting on
progress toward implementing this
strategy.
Finally, our legislation would en-
courage the USAID to help pay for suc-
cessful programs that are run by non-
governmental entities. The message
that we want to send to all of our part-
ners in the private sector, the non-
profit sector, the faith community, and
in local and international civil society
groups is this: If you can figure out an
effective way to increase the likelihood
that mothers and their children will
survive childbirth in those first 5 vul-
nerable years of life, we want to ac-
knowledge your contributions.
We realize that the government does
not have all of the answers and that if
we and our partners in the private sec-
tor all work together, whether they be
nonprofits, foundations, the faith com-
munity, local and international gov-
ernment-sponsored organizations, or
civil society groups, we can solve this
problem.
Improving the health and well-being
of mothers and children around the
world have far-reaching social and eco-
nomic benefits as well. The USAID es-
timates and identifies examples of the
return on our investments in numerous
priority countries. For example, in Af-
ghanistan, Haiti, Liberia, Nepal, South
Sudan, Rwanda, and Yemen, the
USAID estimates that its health in-
vestments may yield a 9-to-1 return in
economic and societal benefits by the
year 2035.
The USAID also estimates its return
on investment in the form of resources
mobilized, which is a measure based on
additional dollar investments that are
made by country governments or local
organizations or by cost savings within
a health system from increased effi-
ciencies. In Senegal, for example, the
USAID estimates $204 million in re-
sources mobilized by 2025, which is a
656-to-1 return on the USAID’s invest-
ment. In India, it estimates that a $25.5
billion investment by the year 2025 is a
striking nearly 3,000-to-1 return on the
USAID’s investment.
Other bipartisan initiatives, such as
the successful President’s Emergency
Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR,
which was started by President George
W. Bush, demonstrate that results-
driven interventions can turn the tide
for global health challenges. In apply-
ing lessons learned from past initia-
tives, our bill would provide the focus
and the tools necessary to accelerate
progress toward a goal that we should
all be able to embrace, which is to end
preventable maternal and child deaths.
I urge my colleagues to join with
Senator COONS and me and our 22 co-
sponsors in supporting this legislation
that will literally save the lives of
mothers and children around the world
by doing what we know works.

Mrs. CAPITO, Ms. DUCKWORTH,
and Ms. MURKOWSKI):

physical disabilities, and isolation are 4 to 10
times more likely to become the victims of
abuse than those without disabilities, ac-
cording to geriatric medical research at
Rush University Medical Center in Chicago,
Illinois;
Whereas close to 50 percent of elderly indi-
viduals suffering from dementia will experi-
ence abuse during their lifetime, according
to the Department of Justice;
Whereas abuse, neglect, and exploitation of
older adults in the United States are uniden-
tified and unreported because of an inability
to report or a fear of reporting;
Whereas only 1 in 23.5 cases of elder abuse
are reported to the authorities, including 1
in 44 cases of financial abuse and 1 in 57 cases
of neglect, according to Weill Cornell Med-
ical Center;
Whereas at least $2,900,000,000 is taken
from older adults each year due to financial
abuse and exploitation, according to the
Government Accountability Office;
Whereas elder abuse, neglect, and exploi-
tation have no boundaries and cross all ra-
cial, social, class, gender, and geographic
lines;

United States cared for an elderly parent,
spouse, or loved one between 2011 and 2017,

signed into law on October 18, 2017, but there
is still more that can be done to stop elder
abuse;
Whereas financial abuse of older adults has
consistently been 1 of the top 10 complaints
made each year to the fraud hotline of the
Special Committee on Aging of the Senate;
Whereas public awareness has the poten-
tial to increase the identification and report-
ing of elder abuse by the public, profes-
sionals, and victims, and can act as a cata-
lyst to promote issue-based education and
long-term prevention;
Whereas private individuals and public
agencies must work together on the Federal,
State, and local levels to combat increasing
occurrences of abuse, neglect, exploitation,
crime, and violence against vulnerable

particularly in light of limited resources for
vital protective services; and
Whereas 2019 is the 14th anniversary of
World Elder Abuse Awareness Day: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) designates June 15, 2019, as ‘‘World
Elder Abuse Awareness Day’’;

CONDEMNING THE EASTER SUN-
DAY TERRORIST ATTACKS IN
SRI LANKA, OFFERING SINCERE
CONDOLENCES TO THE VICTIMS,
TO THEIR FAMILIES AND
FRIENDS, AND TO THE PEOPLE
AND NATION OF SRI LANKA, AND
EXPRESSING SOLIDARITY AND
SUPPORT FOR SRI LANKA
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of Cal-
endar No. 105, S. Res. 184.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the resolution by
title.
The senior assistant bill clerk read as
follows:
A resolution (S. Res. 184) condemning the
Easter Sunday terrorist attacks in Sri
Lanka, offering sincere condolences to the
victims, to their families and friends, and to
the people and nation of Sri Lanka, and ex-
pressing solidarity and support for Sri
Lanka.
There being no objection, the Senate
proceeded to consider the resolution,
which had been reported from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, with an
amendment to insert the part printed
in italic, and with an amendment to
strike the preamble and insert the part
printed in italic, as follows:
Whereas, on April 21, 2019, Sri Lanka suffered
a horrific series of coordinated terrorist attacks
that killed more than 250 people and injured
more than 500 additional people;
Whereas the attacks targeted Christian
churches, in which innocent men, women, and
children were celebrating Easter Sunday;
Whereas the attacks targeted several locations
frequented by foreign tourists, resulting in the
deaths of over 40 people from nations other than
Sri Lanka, including five American citizens, in-
cluding Dieter Kowalski, Amelie Linsey, Daniel
Linsey, and Kieran Shafritz de Zoysa;
Whereas Sri Lanka has determined that a
local Islamist militant group perpetrated this
horrifying attack and is responsible for the re-
sulting loss of life, injury, and destruction;
Whereas the use of nine suicide bombers in
multiple locations demonstrates a high degree of
coordination and planning;
Whereas growing evidence links the Islamic
State to these attacks, demonstrating this ter-
rorist organization’s continued reach and capa-
bility to inflict terror, violence, and brutality
around the world, despite its loss of physical
territory;
Whereas religious freedom is a foundational
and universal right of all people, and religious
freedom and tolerance are important to the
flourishing of multi-religious societies like Sri
Lanka;
Whereas Sri Lanka has worked towards a
lasting peace, ethnic and religious harmony,
and prosperity for all;
Whereas the rights of all religious minorities
must be protected, including the rights of Chris-
tians, who, among other religious communities,
have faced increased violence in recent years
from terrorist groups around the world;
Whereas the United States values its partner-
ship with Sri Lanka and seeks to build on that
partnership by pursuing shared goals in the
Indo-Pacific region;
Whereas the United States is home to a large
Sri Lankan diaspora, who make significant con-
tributions to American society; and
Whereas American law enforcement officials
and military personnel are supporting the Sri
Lankan Government’s investigation of this at-
tack: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) condemns, in the strongest terms, the
terrorist attacks perpetrated by violent
Islamist extremists against innocent civil-
ians on Easter Sunday;
(2) condemns the use of violence against
people of religious faith, including in their
places of worship;
(3) offers its sincere and heartfelt condo-
lences to the victims, their families and
friends, and to the nation of Sri Lanka;
(4) reaffirms its solidarity with the people
of Sri Lanka and its support for the United
States partnership with the nation of Sri
Lanka;
(5) notes, on this 10th anniversary of the
end of Sri Lanka’s civil war, the importance
of national unity and encourages the Gov-
ernment of Sri Lanka to foster such unity,
including religious and ethnic tolerance;
(6) supports efforts to ensure the protec-
tion of all Sri Lankans against retaliatory
attacks as the country recovers from this
tragedy;
(7) reaffirms its commitment to religious
freedom and the importance of protecting
the rights of all religious minorities, includ-
ing Christians;
(8) calls attention to the continued and se-
rious threat posed by the Islamic State and
other international terrorist organizations;
and
(9) calls upon the United States Govern-
ment and all other governments to continue
the fight against violent extremism.
SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON CONSTRUCTION OF

IN HONOR OF THE CAREER OF
WILLIAM F. BISHOP, M.D.
HON. JOSH HARDER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Mr. HARDER of California. Madam Speaker,
Dr. Bishop dedicated the past fourteen years
to serving those who served our country. As a
Lead Physician at the Modesto VA, he served
more than a thousand veterans in the Mo-
desto area, delivering world-class care and
helping fulfill our nation’s promise to support
everyone who serves.
Dr. Bishop went above and beyond the job
description of a physician, bringing hope to his
patients and building trust in the VA system.
According to one of his patients, ‘‘Dr. Bishop
is one of those incredible providers who can
bring an incredibly disgruntled patient into his
exam room who is upset at the VA and the
world, and two minutes later have the same
person laughing and with a better outlook on
life.’’ His lifetime of dedication made an enor-
mous impact on his patients and his commu-
nity, and there are many in the Modesto com-
munity whose lives would not be the same
without him.
Even as he caps off his career, he will still
be serving Modesto veterans as a home-
based primary care physician. I commend his
commitment to Central Valley veterans, and I
wish him a happy retirement.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DAVID
RYAN HURST
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in
recognizing the extraordinary life of David
Ryan Hurst.
David Ryan Hurst represented the very best
among us. While his life was taken far too
soon it was filled with purpose, dedication, and
sacrifice while here on earth. David was born
on June 14, 1992 in Belleville, Illinois. Upon
graduating from high school, he joined the
brave men and women of the United States
Army. Unfortunately, he was only able to
serve a few short months before sustaining a
broken back and being discharged.
After leaving the military, David’s commit-
ment to his country and community did not
stop. He accepted a job as a reserve officer
for the Bellflower Police Department in Mont-
gomery County, Missouri where he worked
over 60 hours a month for free. He truly be-
lieved that being an officer was not just a job
but answering the call to serve his community.
From there, he became a patrolman for the
Wellsville Police Department just up the road
from Bellflower.
Outside of work David filled his life doing
the things he loved most: fishing, rooting on
the St. Louis Cardinals, and most importantly
being a dedicated father to his son and
daughter Meia and Wyatt and loving husband
to his wife Anna.
At 10:42 p.m. on May 16 of this year, David
passed away after his brave battle with can-
cer. Appropriately, the time, 10:42 translates in
law enforcement’s 10 Code to the end of duty.
Perhaps this was God’s way of letting us all
know that his soldier, his officer, and our hero
had been called home.
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring
the life of David Ryan Hurst.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF RE-
TIRED MISSISSIPPIAN, DR. CECIL
WEEKS
HON. TRENT KELLY
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize the retirement of Dr.
Cecil Weeks. Dr. Weeks, a native of Tupelo,
Mississippi, is retiring after a long and distin-
guished 59-year career.
Dr. Cecil Weeks attended Mississippi State
University where he graduated in 1960 with a
Bachelor of Science in Education in English-
Social Studies. Following his graduation, Dr.
Weeks served as a classroom teacher in Lee
County. In 1964, he returned to Mississippi
State University to receive his Master’s in
Educational Leadership and Elementary Edu-
cation and subsequently pursued his Doc-
torate also in Educational Leadership and Ele-
mentary Education in 1977. Dr. Weeks was
the Principal of Tupelo’s Church Street School
into the late nineties and is currently the Co-
Director of the North Mississippi Education
Consortium and an Adjunct Assistant Pro-
fessor at the University of Mississippi.
As a lifelong educator, Dr. Weeks has held
numerous positions in honorary and statewide
offices, such as Chairman of the Three Rivers
Regional Education Service Agency and Presi-
dent of the Mississippi Association of School
Superintendents. Dr. Weeks was also recog-
nized as State Winner and Superintendent of
the Year in 1994 by the American Association
of School Administrators.
In addition to his educational service of
Northeast Mississippi, Dr. Weeks has also
served his community in the Tupelo Civitan
Club. In 1972, he started Boy Scout Troop 85
at Harrisburg Baptist Church and was scout-
master for many years. Dr. Weeks is a Dea-
con at Harrisburg Baptist Church where he
uses his passion for education to teach at
Sunday School to the ‘‘Weeks / Tutor ‘‘class.
I am thankful to Dr. Weeks for dedicating
his life to educating the people of Mississippi.
I wish him and his family all the best in his
well-deserved retirement.
RECOGNIZING VICKI MASSIE OF
BILLINGS
HON. GREG GIANFORTE
OF MONTANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Vicki Massie of Billings for de-
veloping a program to provide computers to
students and organizations that need them,
and for recently setting up two needed com-
puter labs in a rural Montana school.
Vicki is the former executive director of St.
Vincent de Paul in Billings, a nonprofit organi-
zation dedicated to providing personalized
service to those in need. Four years ago, as
the volunteer coordinator, she developed
Project R.E.B.O.O.T., or ‘‘Refurbished Elec-
tronics Bringing Out Opportunities Together.’’
Project REBOOT refurbishes donated com-
puters and distributes them to schools, stu-
dents, and organizations in need. Since its in-
ception, Project REBOOT has given nearly
100 computers to Montana students.
This spring, Vicki’s project helped fill a tre-
mendous need for students of the Northern
Cheyenne Tribal School. Elementary and high
school students at the small, rural school
shared one computer lab. Students faced an-
other challenge: the high school curriculum re-
quired supplemental work online, and there
were only nine laptops for 78 high school stu-
dents.
In one day, that changed.
Through Project REBOOT, Vicki brought 50
computers to the Northern Cheyenne Tribal
School. Vicki and her two sons, who work in
information technology at a nearby school dis-
trict, set up two new computer labs for stu-
dents at the school.
With greater resources and access to tech-
nology, the students of Northern Cheyenne
Tribal School, and all students Vicki has
helped through Project REBOOT, can improve
their skills and further open the doors of op-
portunity, be it in higher education or in the
workforce.
Madam Speaker, for her vision and dedica-
tion to expanding access to technology for
Montana students, I recognize Vicki Massie for
her spirit of Montana.

and rebuild from natural disasters. But aid to
these communities has been long delayed and
I think it is unacceptable that these commu-
nities are being needlessly denied the assist-
ance they needed. I was honored to vote pre-
viously for this aid relief and would have cer-
tainly done so again. The overwhelming mar-
gin by which this legislation passed is testa-
ment to the long-held agreement on the fed-
eral government’s role in responding to these
disasters.
As climate change continues to exacerbate
these sorts of weather events—from drought-
stoked wildfires to climate-exacerbated flood-
ing—we need to make sure the federal gov-
ernment is not only responding to these
events but working to mitigate their damage
before they strike. As we invest in infrastruc-
ture, climate resilience must be a top priority
so that these sorts of weather events don’t
continually cost more in response funding
each year.
Additionally, had I been present for Roll Call
Vote 233 on H.R. 2940, which extends author-
ization for the Temporary Assistance for
Needy Families (TANF) program through the
end of the fiscal year, I would have voted yea.
TANF is a crucial resource for thousands of
families throughout Illinois—and throughout
the Tenth District. While I look forward to a
more thorough policy discussion on how we
can improve and expand TANF in the coming
years, I believe it was essential that Congress
provide certainty to families and communities
that rely on these programs. I was encouraged
that Illinois saw a benefit increase for the first
time in over a decade, but Congress must
have a more robust discussion on how we can
expand these benefits in the future while en-
suring the long-term sustainability of this pro-
gram.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF
JOSEPH CHRISTOPHER, JR.
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, it is my honor
to acknowledge the life of World War II vet-
eran, Joseph Christopher, Jr. Born March 16,
1923 in Vicksburg, Mississippi, Mr. Chris-
topher left his hometown as a young man to
serve his country in the Armed Forces in No-
vember of 1945. Joseph Christopher was hon-
orably discharged with a World War II Victory
Medal and an Army of Occupation Medal in
February of 1947.
After his time spent in courageous commit-
ment to our country, Mr. Christopher was the
victim of a hate crime by police officers in Mis-
sissippi upon his return home. He was badly
beaten, thrown into jail without his family being
notified, provided no medical attention, and
deprived VA benefits. Despite this experience,
Mr. Christopher was never bitter and worked
only to have a positive impact on others for
the rest of his days. Joseph Christopher was
an honored community member who was
loved by his family and friends alike.
It is with great sadness that we recognize
the loss of Joseph Christopher and give tribute
to his surviving family.
HONORING THE LIFE OF ETELVINA
MENCHACA FOR HER PUBLIC
SERVICE
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, today I
rise to celebrate the life of Etelvina Menchaca.
Ms. Menchaca was a dedicated activist in my
district who was very passionate about her
community and public service.
Etelvina Menchaca was born in Santa Bar-
bara, California on September 8, 1938 to
Isabela Davila and Juan Gallegos. She was
raised by her Godmother Feliz (Pita)
Menchaca and Antonio Serrano as well as
long-time family friend Jose (Tuti) Hernandez.
Ms. Menchaca was influenced at an early age,
by her adopted mother Pita, to be a commu-
nity activist. She began serving food to the
homeless and helping Latino immigrant fami-
lies transition to the United States. Ms.
Menchaca was also a leading voice on chil-
dren’s education through migrant education.
She marched and worked alongside Cesar
Chavez, lobbied in Washington DC alongside
Dolores Huerta, and helped organize and train
thousands of Latino families throughout the
western United States for over fifty years.
Ms. Menchaca joined parents from through-
out California in advocating for AB 1308 and
SB 218 which authorized Migrant Education
programs under Chapter 1 Categorical pro-
grams. She worked with Santa Barbara Coun-
ty Superintendents of Schools Dall’Armi and
Cirone on a partnership to implement those
programs locally. She was also appointed as
parent representative from the Santa Barbara
School District for Migrant Education, State
Parent Advisor for All Chaptered Education
programs and State representative at the fed-
eral level.
Additionally, Ms. Menchaca served in lead-
ership roles on the boards of many community
and state organizations including La Casa de
la Raza, the Mariachi Festival, C.I.N.A.C., and
the Fraternal Order of Eagles Aerie #442
Woman’s Auxiliary. Ms. Menchaca also re-
ceived Latina Woman of the Year.
It was an honor to know and work with Ms.
Menchaca. Today I join the Menchaca Family
and Santa Barbara community in celebrating
the extraordinary life of Etelvina Menchaca.
f
SECRET, GOTCHA, MOTIONS TO
RECOMMIT
HON. BRAD SHERMAN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, the rules
of the House normally provide a substantial
amount of time between when members re-
ceive a proposed legislative text, and when
they are called upon to vote. Ordinary process
requires that before voting to add any, or sub-
tract any language from the statutes of the
United States, that a member of Congress
should review the proposed legislative enact-
ment, its implications, and whether the statu-
tory change will actually achieve the intended
purpose of the legislation.
It is not enough for a member of Congress
to vote for legislation because he or she
agrees with the purposes, sentiments, and
rhetoric of its supporters. What matters is the
actual effect of the statuary language.
The minority has adopted the tactic of an-
nouncing a motion to recommit just minutes
before members are called upon to vote on it.
Even when the motion to recommit is only a
few pages, it may add or subtract a section of
law that requires considerable analysis. It can-
not be presumed that the motion to recommit
will achieve its stated purpose or will not have
unforeseen consequences.
If the minority is engaged in serious legis-
lating, they would publish their proposed mo-
tion to recommit (or even publish two possible
motions to recommit) at least 24 hours before
we are expected to vote on final passage. Of
particular concern to me is proposing legisla-
tive language and claiming that it will be help-
ful to strengthen the U.S.-Israel alliance. With-
out a few hours to study a matter, it is difficult
to determine whether the statutory language
will actually achieve that objective and avoid
unintended consequences.
Moreover, those seriously interested in im-
proving the U.S.-Israel alliance would share
their purposed legislative texts a day or two in
advance (or perhaps a week or two ahead in
advance) with the members (in my case the
co-chair) of the Israel Allies Caucus, and they
would also share it with other members who
have established their dedication to the U.S.-
Israel relationship.
Pseudo-Zionists will claim to be supporting
the U.S.-Israel alliance while instead weak-
ening that alliance through partisan tactics. On
occasion they will spring a supposedly pro-
Israel measure for a vote just minutes after it
is made available even to the most pro-Israel

If a measure proposed a legislative change
and I have not had enough time to review its
implications, and how the statutory language

Monday, June 10, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the González Reynoso Family, own-
ers of the Northgate Market grocery store
chain that is a shining example of how a fam-
ily owned business can enhance the lives
within the communities they serve.
From humble beginnings in Jalisco, Mexico,
the immigrant family opened the first
Northgate Market in a 3,000-square foot-store
in Anaheim in 1980. The family now operates
40 supermarkets in Orange, Los Angeles, and
San Diego counties. Via its philanthropic arm

million in scholarships to support students pur-
suing higher education.
Other beneficiaries of Fundación Familia
González Reynoso are DREAMer immigrants,
who receive scholarships through Northgate’s
support of the OC Hispanic Education Endow-
ment Fund, UCI Dream Center, TELACU Edu-
cation Foundation and Catholic Charities of
Orange County.
To raise awareness of chronic health issues
affecting the Latino community, the family-
owned and operated company introduced Viva
La Salud, a comprehensive health and
wellness initiative. Northgate started stocking
its store shelves with healthier products, as
well as partnering with vendors and providers
that also work toward improving health and
nutrition. As part of this program, Northgate of-
fers special fresh food promotions, in-store
cooking classes, store tours and food labeling
education.
In keeping with their Viva La Salud philos-
ophy, Northgate Markets is working with grant
partner UC San Diego School of Medicine to
increase affordable food access to low-income
families who receive Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program benefits. Called ‘‘Mas
Fresco, More Fresh,’’ the program helps pro-
mote long-term health by providing financial
rebates on fruit and vegetable purchases.
Orange County Kid Healthy is another ex-
ample of a Northgate partnership promoting
healthy eating. For the last seven years,
Northgate has hosted the Kid Healthy Cooking
Up Change contest for culinary students who
attend Title I schools. The program provides
the tools and training to transform school
lunch menus to include healthier foods, de-
velop their cooking skills, and inspire students
to continue their educations in the field of cul-
inary arts and nutrition sciences.
Additionally, the Viva La Salud program or-
ganizes local 5K runs and clinical breast
exams and mammogram screenings for at-
need women through a partnership with the
Susan G. Komen Affiliates.
Northgate employees, who are referred to
as ‘‘associations’’ and treated like family, are
also provided with tools to thrive and succeed.
The company offers a comprehensive health
program, matches retirement plan contribu-
tions, and offers college scholarships.
Madam Speaker, it is my distinct privilege to
honor this humble, loyal family of innovators
who not only achieved the American Dream
but are now recognized and trusted as the
‘‘Supermarket Champions of Health and
Wellness.’’

INTRODUCING LEGISLATION RE-
QUIRING THE DEPARTMENT OF
DEFENSE TO REVIEW AND UP-
DATE FORMS CONTAINING RA-
CIALLY OR ETHNICALLY INSEN-
SITIVE TERMINOLOGY
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to introduce legislation requiring the De-
partment of Defense (DOD) to review and
modernize any of its in use forms utilizing out-
dated and racially insensitive terminology.
Today, Senator TAMMY DUCKWORTH will intro-
duce the same legislation in the U.S. Senate.
I thank her for joining me in this effort, and ex-
press my gratitude for the 42 members of the
House of Representatives and the four Sen-
ators who have joined us in introducing this
legislation.
It was recently brought to my attention that
the Defense Department’s DD–2064 Form,
which is issued when a service member loses
his or her life while deployed overseas, utilized
the term ‘‘Negroid’’ as one of the means for
denoting race. Quite frankly, I was shocked to
see this term listed on documentation sent to
the family of one of my constituents just a few
months ago, after their son lost his life in serv-
ice to our country.
Imagine for a moment what this must feel
like. In the midst of the pain and crisis of los-
ing a son, a daughter, a husband, or a wife,
to receive a form from the Federal government
identifying that loved one with outdated, offen-
sive, pseudoscientific terminology once used
to justify racism and concepts like racial inferi-
ority or racial superiority. No family should
ever have to cope with such added injury
when mourning a family member in a time of
crisis.
This terminology is not compliant with re-
quirements from DOD and the Office of Man-
agement and Budget (OMB). In 1997, OMB
set guidance for federal data on race and eth-
nicity, and in the years that followed, DOD re-
leased several issuances guiding the imple-
mentation of OMB’s direction.
I also want to acknowledge—and I want to
be very clear—that the Department of Defense
acted expeditiously to rectify this oversight
once my office brought it to their attention.
While I commend them for addressing this
issue with the seriousness it requires, the fact
that this document retained outdated termi-
nology for more than two decades calls into
question the status of other forms in use by
the Department. It is my understanding that
the Department has begun a process of re-
viewing hundreds of other forms to ensure that
no others are out of compliance. However, this
review is just a small fraction of the forms and
surveys utilized by the Department, individual
service components, and military installations
world-wide.
That is why this legislation is a necessary
step that is in the best interest of our service
members and our country.
This is a short, straightforward bill. It re-
quires the DOD to review each of its forms
and surveys currently in use to determine if
any others contain terms or classifications that
may be considered racially or ethnically insen-
sitive. If they find any, they must take the ap-
propriate steps to modernize them.
I would again like to thank my colleagues
who have supported this measure, and ask
that we move expeditiously to bring it to the
floor for a vote.

OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Julie Rothenfluh for 23 years of
service at the Naperville Public Library.
Julie’s contributions to the Naperville Public
Library are truly noteworthy. As Executive Di-
rector, Julie has guided the library through a
period of profound change. While technology
has substantially changed the way we receive
information, the Naperville Public Library has
adapted to meet the needs of an evolving
community. Julie’s strategic plan for the library
has placed a special emphasis on accessibility
and innovation. Her hard work and determina-
tion have helped the library achieve a five-star
rating from the Library Journal for ten con-
secutive years. This puts the Naperville Public
Library among the top libraries in the country.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in recognizing Julie Rothenfluh and her
outstanding contributions to the City of
Naperville, the Naperville Public Library, and
the many lives she has touched.

IN SUPPORT OF H. RES. 413 REC-
OGNIZING THE 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF D-DAY
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in support of H. Res. 413 recognizing the 75th
anniversary of D-Day.
I would like to thank Congressmen WILSON,
SCHIFF, and LATTA, as my fellow co-chairs of
the French Caucus, for joining me in intro-
ducing H. Res. 413 to express the gratitude
and appreciation of the House of Representa-
tives to the members of the United States and
Allied Armed Forces for their leadership, brav-
ery, and sacrifices in Normandy on June 6,
1944.
June 6, 2019 marks the 75th anniversary of
the day the United States launched the largest
amphibious assault in history at Normandy,
alongside troops of the United Kingdom, Can-
ada, and France. Operation Overlord—more
commonly known as D-Day—was instrumental
in bringing an end to World War II.
The success of the Normandy campaign did
not come without tremendous loss of life, but
it ultimately turned the tide for the Allies and
led to the liberation of Europe. We owe a debt
of gratitude to the members of the ‘‘Greatest
Generation,’’ who helped free the world from
Nazi and Fascist regimes and restore liberty in
Europe. Without their heroism and valor, our
world today would be a very different place.
Five hundred veterans will travel to Nor-
mandy to commemorate the 75th anniversary
of D-Day and the Normandy landings. They
are just a fraction of the more than 2 million
men that landed in Northern France over the
course of Operation Overlord. As their num-
bers dwindle, so does the living memory of the
events. It is incumbent upon us to ensure their
sacrifices are never forgotten.
A generation ago—in the aftermath of D-
Day and World War II—it was second nature
that the ties the United States had with Euro-
pean nations represented our most important
alliance. This relationship was fresh in our
minds, having fought alongside one another
and sacrificed so much over the course of the
war. I too share this bond; my own uncle was
killed defending democracy on French soil
during World War II. Today, I fear the signifi-
cance of the events of World War II and our

alliance with Europe is often lost on the
younger generations, and that we have not
done enough to pass down this important his-
tory so the courage of everyone who fought in
and supported the war effort and the values
they defended are never forgotten.
The people of France and Normandy have
made substantial efforts to preserve the his-
tory and significance of the D-Day beaches
and other important sites for future genera-
tions. I have been fortunate to visit the monu-
ments at Normandy and I have seen homes in
the area displaying both French and American
flags. Each time, I have been profoundly
moved by the reminders of the sacrifices
made by U.S. and Allied Forces, and I thank
the people of France and Normandy for pre-
serving this history. This resolution recognizes
their efforts and calls for expanding edu-
cational activities to pass on the lessons of
World War II from generation to generation.
The alliances we forged with our European
partners during and after World War II were a
testament to the fact that we are stronger
when our allies are stronger and when we
stand arm-in-arm in the face of common
threats and adversaries. That is why we intro-
duced House Resolution 413 out of apprecia-
tion for this alliance and the members of the
United States Armed Forces and Allied armed
forces who participated in the D-Day oper-
ations, as well as the countless individuals
who supported the war effort.

WE NEED TO GIVE U.S. WORKERS
MORE REAL POWER OVER THEIR
FUTURES
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I include
in the RECORD this article by Ms. Zoë Baird
and Mr. Denis McDonough concerning cre-
ating opportunity for American workers.
WE NEED TO GIVE U.S. WORKERS MORE REAL
POWER OVER THEIR FUTURES
(By Zoë Baird and Denis McDonough)
Even in the midst of a historically strong
job market, jarring economic transformation
is leading presidential candidates to be de-
fined as capitalists or socialists. If the polit-
ical debate continues in this shorthand, it
will miss the principal issue that has ani-
mated voters’ views in recent elections: The
American Dream is no longer viable—or is at
least deeply at risk—for wide swaths of the
population. Voters want candidates whose
proposals will generate market power for in-
dividual workers.
The issue is critical given the biggest so-
cial and economic challenge facing the
world—the dislocation of workers by artifi-
cial intelligence and automation. This trans-
formation is exacerbating the crisis of in-
equality. So far, the answer from politicians
of both parties is simply for those individ-
uals to ‘‘re-skill.’’ This is a mistake—and
one we’ve made before.
In addressing the last major disruption—
globalization—policymakers’ attempts at
labor-market reform lagged behind rapid
economic transformation, thus undercutting
workers. Today, expanding access to skills
must be part of a broader agenda that results
in workers obtaining power in the market-
place; they should share in the wealth their
know-how creates and benefit from the data
their engagement provides. This is what will
bring back income growth and career secu-
rity and preserve the dignity of work.
To start, employers need to make their
employees’ talents more transparent, so
workers can capitalize on their value. Today,
people trained on the job have no way of
marketing the skills they have gained to po-
tential new employers. An experienced auto
mechanic, for instance, is viewed as just that
by the labor market, even though his em-
ployer values him for his in-depth knowledge
of intricate machinery, electrical systems
and computerized diagnostics. If that auto
mechanic wants to get a job he is surely
qualified for as a repair tech at an advanced
manufacturing company, he is nearly power-
less to do so. Some may point to licensing as
a solution (about 30 percent of U.S. workers
require a license to do their job), but licenses
rarely reveal the underlying skills necessary
to a job.
However, if employees were provided with
a skills transcript—a verifiable account of
all the skills in their job—they would not be
constrained by their job title and could pur-
sue any job that needed their unique collec-
tion of skills. As technology transforms the
workplace, such a transcript could be a pass-
port to opportunity; individuals could mar-
ket their skills portfolio, and employers
would gain access to a broader pool of talent.
Our lack of transparency around skills is
far from the only way that skills have been
systematically undervalued by the labor
market. Employers routinely use the tradi-
tional four-year college degree as a catchall
qualification. Indeed, that experienced auto
mechanic likely wouldn’t even be considered
for that advanced manufacturing job without
a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineer-
ing. The almost 7 in 10 Americans without a
college degree are screened out of many jobs
in the digital economy despite marketable
skills and capacity to learn.
Employers are beginning to accept non-
traditional certifications as credentials,
which is encouraging, but we must do more.
After all, a self-taught coder may be just as
good as one who took a 12-week course at a
local boot camp, and a carpenter who learned
in a friend’s garage may be just as good as
one who completed a class at a community
college. Much like how colleagues can use
Web-based tools to ‘‘endorse’’ an applicant’s
skills, we need an infrastructure that allows
for skills gained through such channels to be
endorsed, displayed and valued.
State and federal governments wield a tre-
mendous amount of power to support work-
ers and encourage companies to do the same.
They can increase and direct financial sup-
port for lifelong education and training, and
promote improved data-sharing among sec-
tors and states, so educators know what kind
of skills they need to teach and individuals
can decide which training programs are
worthwhile.
When viewed through a lens of workers
gaining power in the labor market to ad-
vance themselves, the tax code appears ripe
for examination. A first step would be cre-
ating pretax ‘‘skills accounts’’—like health
savings accounts, but with the money to be
used for education—and expanding use of
training tax credits. We should look for ways
to treat employees as a highly valued asset,
not just a cost.
Unions can also contribute to individual
workers’ market power as well as their col-
lective power, through training, job data and
advocacy. Because many jobs in the new
economy fall outside the scope of unioniza-
tion, unions need to look at how they also
can support nonunion workers in achieving
market power.
In the past, we’ve evaluated economic pol-
icy proposals from a politician or a CEO on
a variety of metrics. But in an economy in
the throes of transformation, it’s time that
we adopt a new measure: Does it give U.S.
workers more real power over their future?

HONORING LEWIS F. BROWN
HON. MIKE THOMPSON
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to remember Lewis F.
Brown for his years of exceptional public serv-
ice to Solano County, California and to honor
him for his commitment to our community.
Born in Cleveland, Mississippi as the ninth
of twelve children, Mr. Brown moved to Cali-
fornia in the 1950s after he served in the Ko-
rean War. He attended Vallejo College and
San Francisco State University where he grad-
uated with a B.S. in Political Science. Mr.
Brown was elected to the City Council of
Vallejo in 1965. This victory made Mr. Brown
the first African American individual to be
elected to office in Solano County. He later
served as Vice Mayor. In 1970, Mr. Brown
was the first African American attorney in So-
lano County and the first African American at-
torney to integrate a law firm in the San Fran-
cisco Bay Area—Beeman, Bradley, Brown and
Beeman.
Mr. Brown was a lifelong advocate, rep-
resenting marginalized people and those with-
out a platform. He sued the State of California
to eliminate the offensive legal title that was
given to children whose parents were not mar-
ried. Within Solano County he worked to de-
velop local housing assistance programs. Mr.
Brown also challenged the discriminatory pol-
icy that required beauticians of color take
more curriculum than white beauticians. The
equal policy he helped create has been in use
by the California Cosmetology Board since the
1960s. Mr. Brown also helped the City of
Vallejo receive matching funds to build its
John F. Kennedy Public Library. Mr. Brown
worked with Los Angeles city and county offi-
cials in the 1960s to replicate the community
harmony that the City of Vallejo fostered. Mr.
Brown was integral to Vallejo being named the
most ‘‘Multicultural City in America’’ in the
2000 and 2010 censuses.
Madam Speaker, Lewis F. Brown had an
unrelenting commitment to serve the people of
Solano County and the City of Vallejo through-
out his life. It is therefore fitting and proper
that we honor the service and remember the
life of Lewis F. Brown here today.

celebrate Hall County’s growth and success,
and to congratulate the honorees on their well-
deserved achievement. This year, the W.G.

forts. Lanier Technical College and its presi-
dent, Ray Perren, were presented with the

The Chamber celebrated local businesses
by bestowing both Riverside Pharmacy and
WDUN with the Family Business of the Year
Award. M&R Equipment Rental & Sales and
BGW Dental Group were both named Small

The Chamber also celebrated the rapid eco-
nomic growth in Hall County. By next month,
the Chamber projects up to 1,200 new jobs—
including 26 new doctors and $310 million in
capital investment—will be added to Hall
County’s economy. As economic development
and quality of life in Hall County continues to

risk of entrepreneurship. They are among
those who help drive Hall County’s economic
growth into the future.
I want to thank the Hall County Chamber of
Commerce for empowering our community by
connecting local businesses and offering re-
sources to support their continued success.
When local business owners collaborate with
one another, they energize our economy and
build an even stronger sense of community
here in Hall County.
I congratulate the 2019 honorees on their
well-deserved recognition and wish them suc-
cess for many years to come.

HONORING THE KNICKERBOCKER
GOLF CLUB AS THEY CELE-
BRATE THEIR 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is with
great pride that I rise today to join the New
Haven community in extending my heartfelt
congratulations to Knickerbocker Golf Club as
members gather to celebrate the organiza-
tion’s 75th Anniversary—a remarkable mile-
stone for this unique community treasure.
Founded in 1944 by Charles Dorsey and
Alex Smith, the Knickerbocker Golf Club is
one of the oldest African-American golf clubs
in the nations. Since then, the Knickerbocker
Club has been another proud example of an
African-American institution that has flourished
in the midst of and despite our nation’s long-
history with segregation. Augusta National, the
storied golf club in Georgia which opened in
1932, did not accept its first African American
member until 1990. Charlie Sifford—the Jackie
Robinson of the PGA Tour—was never once
invited to play at there. But, he was welcome
at the Knickerbocker Pro-Am, and, the club
continues its welcoming spirit today.
Well ahead of its time, the Knickerbocker
Golf Club not only provided a place for African
Americans to play golf, but it also provided a
safe and encouraging environment for young
men in the community. Founding members
acted as mentors, giving young people an out-
let—a place to go instead of the streets or
local pool halls. That tradition continues today.
The Knickerbocker Golf Club not only provides
this place of mentorship but scholarships
which have allowed many young people to
pursue a higher education and realize their
dreams.
Sports have long been a great equalizer in
America, and, as the Knickerbocker Club con-
tinues to demonstrate, they provide our young
people an opportunity to learn discipline, focus
and commitment while fostering a longtime
hobby and lifetime love. It is for those reasons
that the Knickerbocker Club has been so im-
portant to our community for the last seventy-
five years, and why it remains so.
In Italian we have a saying ‘‘Cent’ Anni’’—
to one hundred years. It is my great honor to
stand today to congratulate the Knickerbocker
Golf Club on the celebration of their 75th Anni-
versary and extend my very best wishes for
many more years of success.

HONORING THE 20TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE INDIANA FEVER
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker,
I rise today in recognition of the 20th anniver-
sary of the Indiana Fever basketball team.
Founded only four years after the founding of
the Women’s National Basketball Association
(WNBA), the Fever have demonstrated a con-
sistent commitment to providing excellent
sports entertainment and to giving back to
their community. The people of the Fifth Con-
gressional District are grateful for the Indiana
Fever and it is my pleasure to congratulate the
Indiana Fever and the entire Pacers Sports &
Entertainment organization in Indianapolis, In-
diana, in celebration of this special occasion.
Arriving in Indianapolis in 1999 while I was
Deputy Mayor of the City of Indianapolis, the
team became an immediate mainstay of Hoo-
sier sports. Former President and General
Manager of the team, Kelly Krauskopf, formed
the first Indiana Fever Community Advisory
Board, which I was proud to be a part of. With
the generous support of owners Herb Simon
and the late Mel Simon, the team quickly
climbed the ladder of success. Today, the
team has secured a league-record 13 playoff
appearances—reaching the WNBA Finals
three times and claiming the league title in
2012 to bring the first professional basketball
championship to Indianapolis since the Indiana
Pacers’ ABA title in 1973. Under the leader-
ship of star player Tamika Catchings, the Fe-
ver’s 12 consecutive playoff appearances from
2005 to 2012 represented, at the time, the
second-longest active playoff streak in Amer-
ican professional sports.
The incredible success of the Indiana Fever
would not have been possible without the
dedication made by the players who have de-
voted their lives to the game of basketball.
Among the best athletes in the world, many
Fever players and coaches have gone on to
compete in the Olympics. Nikki McCray, Nat-
alie Williams, Kara Wolters and Tamika
Catchings have played for the United States
Olympic Team, while Nell Fortner has the re-
markable distinction of having been appointed
as the first head coach of the Fever while she
was still coaching the United States Olympic
Team. During this time, Coach Fortner led the
U.S. Olympic Team to a perfect 8–0 record,
claiming the Olympic Gold medal and claiming
the record for the most wins of any coach in
Women’s USA Basketball history. Former
Fever head coach and Women’s Basketball
Hall of Fame inductee, Coach Lin Dunn, led
the team to their 2012 WNBA title after serv-
ing as an Assistant Coach for the U.S. Wom-
en’s Olympic Team in 1990. During her time
as President and General Manager of the
team, Kelly Krauskopf led them to the WNBA
playoffs 13 times and helped further many of
their outreach programs. In 2018, Ms.
Krauskopf moved to the Indiana Pacers, be-
coming the first female assistant general man-
ager in the history of the NBA. The remark-
able success of the Indiana Fever both on and
off the court can be attributed to this strong
legacy of dedication and achievement exhib-
ited by players and coaches alike.
Through their record of success, the Indiana
Fever remind us of the importance of women
in all levels of sport. Under the leadership of
the Simon family, and through their consistent
dedication to women’s basketball, the Fever
seeks to promote increased participation of
women and girls in sports. With a stated mis-
sion to ‘‘promote the development and well-
being of youth and families within our commu-
nity,’’ the team has done a great deal to make
Indiana a better place for families to live and
grow. The team regularly invites members of
our community, including participants in Big
Brothers Big Sisters, the Boys and Girls Club
and Girl Scouts, to attend season games at no
cost. The Choices for Champions program
combats bullying in schools by educating
young people and hosting them at a pre-sea-
son game where they can learn about the im-
pacts of bullying. The team’s Hoops For
Troops program seeks to honor active duty
and retired military heroes through military
base visits, in-arena nights and meet-and-
greets with Wounded Warriors, while the
Hoops For A Cure Auction has raised over
$200,000 in total for breast cancer patients.
The Indiana Fever has, and continues to do,
great things for the people of Indiana. Players
on the team have been honored nineteen sep-
arate times with the WNBA Community Assist
Award, with eight of these going to long-time
player Tamika Catchings alone. Ms. Catchings
has also been honored twice with the Dawn
Staley Leadership Award, one of the highest
community service awards in the WNBA.
Under the new leadership of Dr. Allison Bar-
ber, President, and Tamika Catchings, Vice
President, the Fever are working to continue
to build the premiere WNBA franchise in the
country. During their 20-year tenure in Indian-
apolis, the team has transformed and im-
proved the lives of countless young people
and their families. On behalf of all Hoosiers, I
would like to thank them for their continued
dedication to our communities and wish them
success in the future.

COMMEMORATING THE FIFTIETH
ANNUAL FREEDOM FUND
AWARDS PRESENTED BY THE
ELMIRA-CORNING NAACP
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
commemorate the fiftieth annual Freedom
Fund Awards presented by the Elmira-Corning
Branch of the National Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored People (NAACP).
On Friday, June 7, 2019, the Elmira-Corning
Branch of the NAACP held their fiftieth annual
Freedom Fund Awards Dinner. The Freedom
Fund Awards are presented by the branch to
recognize those who have contributed to the
success of the organization and the commu-
nity as a whole. The branch also awarded
scholarships to high school students and pre-
sented community service awards.
Since its inception in 1909, the NAACP has
strived to better the lives of African Americans
across the country. In addition to ensuring the
civil rights of African Americans, the NAACP
also provides programs to address drug
abuse, teenage pregnancy, illiteracy, jobless-
ness, violent crime, and the portrayal of mi-
norities in the media. Their role in creating a
more equal and fair America is essential and
important.
Fifty years of recognizing charity and sup-
porting scholarships in the community is cer-
tainly a cause for celebration. I congratulate
the Elmira-Corning branch of the NAACP on
this impressive milestone and look forward to
their continued success in the years to come.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
recognize the fiftieth annual Freedom Fund
Awards presented by the Elmira-Corning
Branch of the NAACP.

RECOGNIZING NORTHWESTERN
UNIVERSITY’S INSTITUTE FOR
POLICY RESEARCH
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the Institute for Policy Re-
search at Northwestern University as it cele-
brates its 50th anniversary.
The Institute was founded in 1968–1969 as
the Center for Urban Affairs by twelve faculty
and was renamed the Institute for Policy Re-
search in 1996. Over its 50 years, the Institute
for Policy Research has earned national rec-
ognition and respect as a premier social
science research center and has produced
valuable and actionable research about social
and political issues facing the City of Chicago,
the State of Illinois, the country, and the world.
The Institute for Policy Research’s mission
is to stimulate and support excellent social
science research on significant public policy
issues and to disseminate the findings wide-
ly—to students, scholars, policymakers, and
the public. The Institute is a dynamic hub for
rigorous social science research that main-
tains a strong community of 150 interdiscipli-
nary scholars across the Northwestern com-
munity investigating health-related social dis-
parities, education policy, crime, race, poverty,
community development, and more.
Institute for Policy Research faculty fellows
and associates have received high honors
from distinguished bodies such as the National
Academy of Sciences, the National Academy
of Education, the National Academy of Medi-
cine, the American Educational Research
Foundation, and the Yidan Prize Foundation.
I congratulate the Institute for Policy Re-
search at Northwestern University on this mile-
stone and applaud the Institute’s contribution
to the improvement of people’s lives through
research and policy development.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF
MR. JACK GUTMAN
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I wish to
honor Mr. Jack Gutman of Anaheim, Cali-
fornia, who served as a U.S. Navy Corpsman
in WWII. At age 18, Corpsman 1st Class
Gutman provided treatment to the wounded
and dying at some of the bloodiest battles
throughout the European and Pacific theaters
including the beaches of Normandy on D-Day.
Mr. Gutman, now 93 years old, still vividly
remembers when his unit landed on Utah
Beach 75 years ago on June 6, 1944. With
bullets flying, bombs exploding, and men
dying all around him, Corpsman Gutman
helped all he could, giving shots of morphine,
applying bandages and tourniquets and pro-
viding words of comfort to soldiers who died in
his arms.
What he thought was going to be ‘‘a piece
of cake’’ turned into an ‘‘absolute nightmare.’’
Following the honors of D-Day, he suffered
from post-traumatic stress disorder for 66
years before seeking treatment.
Mr. Gutman wrote a book about his experi-
ence titled One Veteran’s Journey to Heal the
Wounds of War. In the book, he describes the
impact the war had on his life: ‘‘My experi-
ences had changed my outlook on my life and
the world. I went into the war with a fervor to
fight for my country and protect our freedom,
but the experience had been nothing like what
I thought when I signed up to join the Navy.
Back at home, I thought constantly of the men
that had died overseas. I wondered how and
why I survived.’’ His story also has been docu-
mented by the National World War II Museum
in New Orleans, Louisiana.
Today, Mr. Gutman shares his story with
other veterans as a public speaker. He uses
his personal experiences to help veterans
overcome the struggles of PTSD by encour-
aging them to seek support.
Mr. Gutman has also valuably served Cali-
fornia’s 46th Congressional District by inter-
acting with our Youth Congressional Leaders
and leading the flag salute for our Service
Academy and other events.
Recently, Mr. Gutman traveled to Wash-
ington, D.C. as part of a Veterans Honor Flight
to visit the various war memorials and honor
the service and sacrifices of all military vet-
erans.
On the 75th anniversary of D-Day, Mr.
Gutman has returned to France for the first
time to take part in a documentary film about
the pivotal invasion, which paved the way for
an Allied victory one year later.
Mr. Gutman’s valiant service to both his
country and fellow veterans has made him an
invaluable part of his community. He is an in-
spiration to our community who has undoubt-
edly bettered the lives he touches. For this
reason, I ask my colleagues to join me in hon-
oring and recognizing Mr. Jack Gutman, a true
American hero who continues to serve his
country and community.

KEITH AND EMMA SWARTZ:
FORTY YEARS OF SERVICE
HON. VICKY HARTZLER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, it is a
distinct privilege and personal blessing to con-
gratulate and thank my friends, Keith and
Emma Swartz, for serving the Lord for over 40
years. Pastor Keith Swartz has been a leader
in my community making a difference in the
lives of countless families, achieving 13 years
as Principal and coach at Harrisonville Chris-
tian School, as an elder for over 20 years, and
26 years as Associate Pastor at my church,
Harrisonville Community Church.
Emma Swartz inspired and equipped stu-
dents from kindergarten to 6th grade for 19
years at Harrisonville Christian School as both
Principal and teacher. She used her gift of
teaching beyond the classroom as a respected
Sunday School teacher and a leader of adult
bible studies.
The foundation of their service began at
home where they raised four beautiful children
to love God and others. Now this legacy of
faith and service is being lived out in the lives
of their ten grandchildren. Keith and Emma
are special people individually, but together,
they make a remarkable team that I have
been blessed to know over the years.
Congratulations to Keith and Emma on their
retirement, and I hope they enjoy the days
they have worked so hard to earn. I wish them
continued health and happiness in this new
phase of their lives, and pray God’s richest
blessings on both of them.

LAKE HAVASU CITIZEN OF THE
YEAR JIM SALSCHEIDER
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor a constituent of mine that has made
an outstanding impact for the community of
Lake Havasu. Jim Salscheider of Lake Havasu
has been selected as Lake Havasu’s Citizen
of the Year and will have the distinct honor of
serving as the grand marshal of the London
Bridge Days Parade. Jim has been a tireless
advocate for the community and for the envi-
ronmental causes of Lake Havasu.
His leadership was instrumental in forging
an ongoing friendship and partnership with the
Chemehuevi Tribe, in improving marketing and
promotion for the hundreds of local busi-
nesses that depend on the marine industry,

and developing a relationship with local, re-
gional, state and national governmental enti-
ties. Jim has developed an educational cam-
paign about invasive species in Lake Havasu
and highlighted unfair practices that quar-
antined watercraft at the California ports of
entry.
Furthermore, Jim opened lines of commu-
nication with the United States government
when U.S. Fish and Wildlife dropped no wake
buoys into some of the best skiing water on
Lake Havasu on May 20, 2015. It was be-
cause of his tireless dedication to the commu-
nity at large that myself, Senator John
McCain, Senator Jeff Flake and other federal
officials heard about the arbitrary action that
U.S. Fish and Wildlife had taken. My office be-
came immediately involved and helped facili-
tate a local public meeting with U.S. Fish and
Wildlife, where more than 1,000 concerned
residents voiced their vehement disapproval of
this action. Thanks to Jim’s vigilance, this ac-
tion was reversed on June 16, 2016.
Jim’s leadership truly drives home the point
that the beauty of Lake Havasu is not just in
the serene landscape, but rather the commu-
nity that encompasses it. Our 40th President
of the United States Ronald Reagan summed
it up best when he said that, ‘‘The greatest
leader is not necessarily the one who does the
greatest things. He is the one that gets the
people to do the greatest things.’’ Jim’s lead-
ership perfectly embodies these words and is
proof to everyone that sometimes all that is
necessary is the voice of one principled indi-
vidual. Thank Jim Salscheider for his leader-
ship and dedication to the people of Lake
Havasu. Congratulations.

HONORING THE AMERICAN LEGION
ON THE CELEBRATION OF THEIR
CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is with
great pride that I rise today to extend my
heartfelt congratulations to the American Le-
gion as they mark their 100th Anniversary. As
we mark this extraordinary milestone, I am
honored to have this opportunity to extend my
deepest thanks to the American Legion Posts
across Connecticut’s 3rd Congressional Dis-
trict whose members work so diligently to both
support our veterans and ensure that our com-
munities never forget the sacrifices made by
those who chose to serve in our nation’s mili-
tary branches.
Chartered by Congress in 1919, the Amer-
ican Legion has evolved into one of the most
influential and effective veteran advocacy or-
ganizations in the country. Over the course of
the last century, the American Legion has left
an indelible mark on our nation. In 1921, the
Legion’s efforts resulted in the creation of the
U.S. Veterans Bureau, forerunner of the Vet-
erans Administration and in 1923 the first
‘‘Flag Code’’ was drafted during a Legion con-
ference in Washington—a code which Con-
gress adopted in 1942. In 1946, the Legion
and the American Legion Auxiliary presented
a small, struggling organization called the
American Heart Association with a $50,000
grant. That grant became the catalyst for the
success of the now nationally respected orga-
nization focused on prevention and treatment
of rheumatic heart disease. It was the Amer-
ican Legion that partnered with the Smithso-
nian Institute’s Air and Space Museum to de-
velop an exhibit for the bomber Enola Gay,
which dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima,
Japan, and it was the Legion who donated the
single largest contribution to the construction
of the Vietnam Memorial.
From financing and implementing a study of
the effects of Agent Orange on soldiers to the
creation of the Family Support Network to as-
sist families of servicemembers deployed for
operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm;
from the formation of the Persian Gulf Task
Force to enhance service for a new generation
of wartime veterans, thousands of whom suf-
fer from illnesses linked to their service in the
region, to the launch of the national ‘‘I Am Not
A Number’’ campaign to identify and docu-
ment the delays veterans face in obtaining
medical care from VA, decade after decade,
the American Legion has strived to ensure
that veterans are receiving the care and re-
spect they have so rightfully earned.
The American Legion has shaped the way
our country treats its veterans. That was per-
haps best demonstrated in 1943 when Past
National Commander Harry W. Colmery start-
ed to write in longhand, on Mayflower Hotel
stationery in Washington, the first draft of what
will later become the ‘‘GI Bill of Rights.’’
Signed in 1944 by then President Franklin D.
Roosevelt, the original GI Bill, or Servicemen’s
Readjustment Act, is appropriately considered
the Legion’s single greatest legislative
achievement.
And it is not just in Washington where the
American Legion has made its mark. With
over two million members in more than 13,000
posts worldwide, the Legion works to ensure
that our servicemembers—their achievements
and their sacrifices—are both remembered
and celebrated. Whether through sponsorship
of local sports organizations, scholarships for
young people, organizing and participating in
parades and community events, the Legion is
making a real difference in community after
community across the country. I want to ex-
tend a special note of thanks to the more than
200 American Legion Posts in Connecticut,
and particularly the 28 located in my District,
whose members’ invaluable contributions
make our communities better places to live,
learn, and grow. My heartfelt congratulations
on your centennial celebration and, as the
Italian saying goes, Cent’ Anni—to another
one hundred years.
HONORING LIEUTENANT SHANNON
YINGLING’S THREE YEARS OF
SERVICE TO HER COUNTRY AT
THE U.S. NAVY OFFICE OF LEG-
ISLATIVE AFFAIRS
HON. RICHARD HUDSON
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize and congratulate Lieutenant
Shannon Yingling for her faithful service to our
country as an esteemed member of the U.S.
Navy’s Liaison Office in the U.S. House of
Representatives.
In this capacity, Lieutenant Yingling oversaw
and led countless congressional and staff del-
egations to destinations throughout the United
States and all four corners of the world. These
trips were pivotal in helping Members and
their staffs achieve a greater understanding of
the issues facing our Navy and its sailors.
Lieutenant Yingling’s distinguished career
began in Annapolis, Maryland, where she en-
tered the Naval Academy as a Plebe. In May
of 2010, Shannon was commissioned as an
Ensign and designated a Student Naval Avi-
ator. She completed Primary Flight Training at
VT–27, where she flew the venerable T–34C
Turbo Mentor, and was sent to HT–28 to learn
to fly the TH–57 Sea Ranger. Upon successful
completion of the Advanced Helicopter Sylla-
bus, LT Yingling earned her Wings of Gold
and was sent to Norfolk for Fleet Replacement
Training in the SH–60S. She was assigned to
HSC–7 from 2013 to 2016, where she de-
ployed twice with Carrier Air Wing THREE
aboard the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75)
and the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69)
in support of Strike Group TEN and Operation
ENDURING FREEDOM.
Lieutenant Yingling’s awards and decora-
tions include the Navy Marine Corps Com-
mendation Medal and Navy and Marine Corps
Achievement Medal, as well as other personal,
campaign, and service ribbons.
As Lieutenant Yingling embarks on a new
chapter in life, it is my hope that she may re-
call, with a deep sense of pride and accom-
plishment, the outstanding contributions she
has made to the United States Navy while at-
tached to the Office of Legislative Affairs. I
would like to send her my very best wishes for
continued success in her future Naval career.
Madam Speaker, please join me today in
honoring Lieutenant Shannon Yingling and her
service to our country.

because of an understanding that the lan-

retary of Agriculture the discretion to provide
assistance to producers who suffered timber
loss due to Hurricanes Michael and Florence.
Even after Hurricanes Irma and Maria, there
have been over 80 major disaster declara-
tions. This much-needed disaster relief will
support our Florida Panhandle communities,
help rebuild Tyndall Air Force Base, assist
farmers and ranchers, restore coastal infra-
structure, and fund the Nutrition Assistance
Program and infrastructure repairs for Puerto
Rico.
I look forward to working with my colleagues
in both chambers of Congress to bring relief to
millions of families.

COMMENDING KIM KOWALEWSKI
HON. JOHN A. YARMUTH
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, today, I
would like to recognize and honor the out-
standing service of Kim Kowalewski, who re-
tires this week after nearly 40 years as a pub-
lic servant, the past 30 of them at the Con-
gressional Budget Office.
Kim Kowalewski joined CBO in 1989. After
serving briefly as a principal analyst in what
was then known as the Fiscal Analysis Divi-
sion, he was promoted to be the Chief of the
Financial and General Macroeconomics Mod-
eling Unit, which analyzed developments in fi-
nancial markets and contributed to the fore-
cast of consumer spending. He next headed
the Financial Markets Unit, which, in addition
to analyzing and forecasting financial market
indicators, prepared cost estimates for various
federal financial programs and developed pol-
icy options for the housing and financial mar-
kets.
In 2008, he was promoted to Deputy Assist-
ant Director of the Macroeconomic Analysis
Division. In that capacity, he played an essen-
tial role in developing CBO’s economic projec-
tions, which underlie the agency’s budget pro-
jections, and he directed numerous studies on
developments in the economy, including the
operation of automatic stabilizers, changes in
trade policy, and the effects of federal tax and
spending policies. In 2016, he became a sen-
ior adviser at CBO. In that role, he led cross-
divisional efforts to improve CBO’s graphics
and written presentations and mentored and
trained colleagues. Throughout, he has been a
leader in making CBO’s analysis accessible.
Kim Kowalewski’s public service did not
begin with his work at CBO. He came to the
agency after eight years at the Federal Re-
serve Bank of Cleveland, where he led the
preparation of the bank’s forecast of the U.S.
economy and provided analysis related to
monetary policy, financial markets, personal
bankruptcy, and consumer spending.
By all accounts, Kim’s colleagues at CBO
and on the Hill appreciate his dedication, abil-
ity, skillful work, and breadth of experience.
They will miss his generosity with his time and
knowledge and, especially, his kindness.
I know my colleagues join me in extending
our thanks and appreciation to Kim for his
service to our country. We wish him well in his
future undertakings and hope that the nation
will continue to benefit from his expertise and
commitment.

RECOGNIZING ST. PAUL BLUE
POINT LUTHERAN CHURCH FOR
ITS 150TH YEAR AS A CON-
GREGATION
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to
acknowledge St. Paul Blue Point Lutheran
Church for its 150th year as a congregation.
Built on October 31, 1869 in Altamont, IL, the
church became a place of peace and fellow-
ship for all attendees.
To celebrate this historic occasion, the
church held honorary services dedicated to
the anniversary on Sunday, June 2. Keynote
speakers of the event included Rev. Mark
Witte and Rev. David Witte, both of whom are
direct descendants from the church’s found-
ers. At present, eleven families are of direct
descent of the original 31 founders and are
still active amongst the congregation.
I extend my well wishes to the current offi-
cers—Rev. David Speers, Todd Wachtel,
Corey Guy, Alex Wendling, Doug Kopplin,
Doug Hammer and many others who have
played a major role in spearheading this
event.
Madam Speaker, the St. Paul Blue Point Lu-
theran Church and the entire congregation
should be very proud of their continuing com-
mitment and service over the past 150 years.
I am excited to see how the church will con-
tinue to grow and make an impact in the years
to come.

ACKNOWLEDGING 40 YEARS OF
THE BUFFALO VET CENTER
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the Buffalo Vet Cen-
ter, which, for the last forty years, has helped
the veterans of Western New Y ark readjust to
life as civilians after returning home from a
combat zone. The Vet Center provides our
brave servicemen and women with much
needed services outside of the traditional VA
network.
Established by Congress in 1979, Vet Cen-
ters aimed to provide counseling and other
health services to military veterans who re-
turned home from Vietnam who were reluctant
to access VA services. Readjustment coun-
seling, a non-medical, community-based ap-
proach, was included in the official services of-
fered to combat veterans. The centers imme-
diately broke down barriers that exist in tradi-
tional healthcare by hiring other veterans as
counselors to build a bond over shared experi-
ences.
Following the high utilization of Vet Centers
around the country, Congress acted to estab-
lish permanent centers in 1983 and made re-
adjustment counseling a lifetime entitlement
for combat veterans who qualify. Eligibility and
services provided have continually expanded
since the 1990s and the constant military in-
volvement in the Middle East created a new
generation of veterans who needed and con-
tinue to depend on the services provided by
the Vet Center.
In 2003, Vet Centers were authorized to
provide bereavement counseling services to
spouses, children, parents, and siblings of
service members who died while on active
duty. Today, there are over 300 permanent
Vet Centers, 80 mobile Vet Centers, a 24/7
Vet Center call line, and more than 2,000 on
staff who help veterans, active duty, and fam-
ily members of those in the armed forces.
I thank the Buffalo Vet Center for its 40
years of serving the veterans of WNY and I
hope they continue to provide exceptional
service to the Veterans in WNY far into the fu-
ture.

HONORING MAYOR JOE JERKINS
HON. DAVID SCOTT
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor an extraordinary
Georgian, public servant and a great Amer-
ican, Mayor Joe Jerkins.
Mayor Joe Jerkins represents the city of
Austell right in the heart of my district. During
his 30-year tenure, Mayor Jerkins has earned
a reputation of being a statesman rather than
a politician.
Mayor Jerkins has dedicated his work to en-
suring Austell, Georgia was home to more
than 6,500 of our diverse constituents. Mayor
Jerkins successfully acquired the former Coats
and Clark Threadmill to conserve the historical
economic driver that created hundreds of jobs
during the Great Depression.
Mayor Jerkins also contributed greatly to the
economic development of Austell. Mayor Jer-
kins led negotiations with the Norfolk Southern
Railroad which resulted in a $5 million dollar
grant from the railroad. Mayor Jerkins led the
City Council into placing the funds into interest
bearing accounts. Interest from the accounts
have been used for several different causes
including the Garrett Middle School truancy
program to keep students in school, Christmas
bonuses for city employees, churches, Austell
schools, cemetery upkeep and for families in
need.
Mayor Jerkins continued his advocacy for
the city of Austell through his role in the At-
lanta Regional Commission where he rep-
resented Cobb County. Mayor Jerkins also
was on the Board of Directors for the North
Central Georgia Law Enforcement Academy.
In these roles, Mayor Jerkins displayed his
passion in serving all Georgians such as stu-
dents, transit employees, and law enforce-
ment.
Mayor Jerkins guided by a philanthropic
compass and dedication to the State of Geor-
gia, is a stellar example of great leadership.
Madam Speaker, I congratulate Mayor Joe
Jerkins on his retirement, and extend my sin-
cerest wishes for his continued health and
happiness.
God bless and best wishes to Mayor Joe
Jerkins and his family.

Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it gives
me great pleasure to rise today to join family,
friends, colleagues, and the Wesleyan Univer-
sity community in extending my heartfelt con-
gratulations to Dr. Gary W. Yohe as he marks
his retirement from Wesleyan University after
more than forty years as a dedicated member
of their faculty. I have had the good fortune to
know Gary for many years and I have no
doubt that in his retirement he will be missed
by colleagues and students alike.
Over the course of his remarkable career,
Gary has achieved a myriad of triumphs and
earned countless accolades. One of the
world’s foremost expert on climate change, he
received a share of the 2007 Nobel Prize as
a senior member of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change and served as Vice
Chair of the National Climate Assessment De-
velopment and Advisory Committee under
President Obama.
Gary has served as a member of the New
York (City) Panel on Climate Change (NPCC),
created in 2008 by then Mayor Michael
Bloomberg to help the City respond to the
risks of climate change, and he has testified
frequently before Congressional committees.
He is also the author of more than 175 schol-
arly articles, several books, and has contrib-
uted to countless media articles on climate
issues as well as providing numerous opinion
pieces. His extraordinary body of work will
long stand as an inspiration to scientists, pol-
icy-makers, and advocates who will no doubt
build on the solid foundation of his legacy.
I would be remiss if I did not add a personal
note of congratulations to Gary as he cele-
brates this milestone. I first met him many
decades ago and have fond memories of the
opportunities we had to work together. I, like
so many others, am in awe of all that he ac-
complished throughout his professional career.
Though he marks his retirement today, I am
confident that Gary will continue to make a dif-
ference in our world. He has left an indelible
mark on his field and his expertise will cer-
tainly continue to be called upon. I wish him
all the best for many more years of health and
happiness as he begins this new chapter of
his life.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF
COMMAND SERGEANT MAJOR
BRAD SEMONELL
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I would like
to honor Command Sergeant Major Brad
Semonell, who served in the United States
Army for 26 years as a master parachute
jumper, Intelligence Officer, and a great lead-
er.
Mr. Semonell was born in Cleveland, Ohio
and ice skated throughout his childhood, earn-
ing a Silver medal at the state-level. Ice skat-
ing gave Mr. Semonell the athleticism and
skills that helped to propel him to excellence
in his military career when he enlisted at 18.
Mr. Semonell became part of the U.S. Army
11th Airborne Division. He then began Jump
School at Ft. Benning and quickly became
Squad Leader, eventually working his way up
to become Platoon Sergeant. Mr. Semonell’s
military career was also marked by the signifi-
cant role he played as an Intelligence Officer
for the elite Army Special Forces in Vietnam
and in East Germany while the Cuban Missile
Crisis was unfolding. Throughout the 1960s,
Mr. Semonell continued to serve and lead, ad-
vancing to Sergeant Major rank.
In 1973 , Mr. Semonell earned his Canadian
Jumping Wings by taking part in the first joint
exercise with the Canadians since 1943. In
1977, Mr. Semonell was promoted to Com-
mand Sergeant Major and retired from the
Army in 1979. Over his career, Mr. Semonell
made over five-hundred parachute jumps. In
one jump, Mr. Semonell severely injured his
shoulder and neck; he still deals with the pain.
Mr. Semonell’s great strides and sacrifices
for our nation have not gone unnoticed. He
has earned numerous awards and recogni-
tions including the Meritorious Service Medal,
two Army Commendation Medals, various
Good Conduct Medals, Army Reserve Compo-
nents Achievements Medals, and many more.
After the Army, Mr. Semonell earned his
General Contractor’s License and started his
own successful business, S & S Construction,
with his son.
In 2000, Mr. Semonell retired. Today, he is
the dedicated Sergeant-at-Arms for the Sons
of the American Legion Squadron 291. He re-
sides in his Anaheim home of over 40 years.
Command Sergeant Major Brad Semonell
embodies the leadership and sacrifice our
great nation is built upon. I am proud to honor
his military career and service to our nation.

HONORING AND COMMEMORATING
SERGEANT JOSEPH P. COLLETTE
HON. STEVE STIVERS
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Mr. STIVERS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
on behalf of the people of Ohio’s 15th Con-
gressional District to honor and commemorate
a husband, a father, a brother, a son, and a
hero. United States Army Sergeant Joseph P.
Collette, of Lancaster, gave his life in the serv-
ice of our nation on March 22, 2019.
At age 29, Sergeant Collette was fulfilling a
goal he had held for over a decade: to deploy
with the United States Army. As his wife,
Caela, tells it, following the tragedy of Sep-
tember 11, her husband felt the call to serve.
As his time with the 242nd Ordnance Bat-
talion, 71st Explosive Ordnance Disposal
Group was coming to an end, he desperately
wanted to go on deployment.
It is that level of bravery, selflessness, and
commitment for which Sergeant Collette will
be remembered by both his loved ones and
community. He was a genuine, laid back,
funny young man who was beloved by many.
A man of many special talents, he loved
sharing his passion for cooking for others and
challenging his friends in paintball matches
and Pokémon battles. He loved spending time
outdoors including running, snowboarding, and
four-wheeling. But his priority in life was
spending time with his friends and family.
Like a pebble dropped in a pond, the ripples
created by Sergeant Collette’s life and work
are far-reaching. His legacy will live on in the
memories of those who knew him and loved
him: his wife, Caela; his children; Blair and
Cody Collette; step-children Lena and Aria
Scott; his parents, Theresa Mecionis and Joe
and Cindy Collette; his siblings; Anthony,
Camille, and Nicholas; and the rest of his ex-
tended family and loved ones.
As a Brigadier General in the Ohio Army
National Guard, I have had the distinct privi-
lege to serve alongside outstanding men and
women like Sergeant Collette. I can say with
absolute certainty that Lancaster, Ohio is un-
deniably a better place because of Sergeant
Collette, and our nation is a safer place be-
cause of his service. I am honored to cele-
brate his legacy, and I encourage my col-
leagues in the House of Representatives to

SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS
ACT, 2019
SPEECH OF
HON. NEAL P. DUNN
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 3, 2019
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of
the Senate Amendment to H.R. 2157, which
will finally provide desperately needed long-
term recovery resources to the communities
that I represent. Until today, my constituents
have waited for 7 months with no certainty
that help would ever come.
This is particularly true for North Florida ag-
ricultural producers and most critical for the
foresters. Hurricane Michael left millions of
acres of forestland in ruin—causing cata-
strophic damage and resulting in billions of
dollars in losses.
My support for this bill was partly due to my
understanding that money appropriated under
Title 1 will give the Secretary of Agriculture the
flexibility necessary to compensate timber pro-
ducers for losses or to issue block grants al-
lowing a state to do so when appropriate. I
look forward to working with Secretary Perdue
throughout the implementation of this bill to
ensure it can best help all struggling pan-
handle agriculture producers.

NORMANDY AND AFRICAN
AMERICAN PARTICIPATION
HON. BARBARA LEE
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, June 10, 2019
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor the 75th anniversary of D-
Day and to lift up the 92nd Infantry, as well as
the Tuskegee Airmen, for their service on that
fateful day that was instrumental in the suc-
cess at Normandy for the Allied advance.
Known as the Buffalo Soldiers, the 92nd In-
fantry was a segregated, all-black military unit;
among them was my father, Lt. Col. Garvin A.
Tutt.
Madam Speaker, we must never forget that
African Americans have fought in every major
military conflict of the United States, from the
Revolutionary War to our current military con-
flicts.
I rise to thank the men and women who
fought in World War II, including 900,000 Afri-
can Americans, 800 of whom were African-
American women from the 6888th Central
Postal Directory Battalion.
America owes a debt of gratitude for the
service and sacrifice of these African Ameri-
cans who, even while fighting the oppression
of segregation, defended our nation and con-
tributed to victory for the U.S. and the Allied
forces.
