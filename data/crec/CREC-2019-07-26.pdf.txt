PRAYER
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer:
God of our ancestors, thank You for
giving us another day.
We pray You, O God, to be with the
Members of this House today and as
they depart for the August recess. Give
them sound judgment and make them
as practical as the American people
who sent them here as their represent-
atives.
Help them to withstand open criti-
cism when they know what is right be-
fore You and conscience. Often they
are characterized by half-truths and at-
tributed motives that are far beneath
them. Uphold them at such times with
personal integrity and compassion for
those most in need.
Having called them to serve others to
the best of their abilities, lift them
even higher by Your grace and power
to live and work for Your greater
honor and glory, both this day and
throughout the remainder of the sum-
mer.
Amen.

RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBU-
TIONS OF DIVERSE U.S. COAST
GUARD SERVICE MEMBERS ON
THE U.S. COAST GUARD’S 229TH
BIRTHDAY
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, July 26, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask the House of Representatives to join
me in recognizing the U.S. Coast Guard on its
upcoming 229th birthday on August 4, 2019.
In honor of this significant occasion, I would
like to particularly recognize the contributions
of Coast Guard men and women from diverse
and underrepresented communities. They
have fought for our country in times of war
and rescued thousands in time of peace.
‘‘Semper Paratus’’ is the U.S. Coast Guard
motto, and regardless of the day, time, or cri-
sis, they have always been ready.
Such U.S. Coast Guard members include
James Leftwich, a member of the Chickasaw
nation. In 1943, Mr. Leftwich enlisted in the
U.S. Coast Guard. He was 14 years of age
and the youngest enlistee. Two years later, he
was wounded at the Battle of Eniwetok. Mr.
Letwich recovered and continued to serve in
the U.S. Coast Guard until 1964.
Master Chief Melvin Kealoha Bell, a native
Hawaiian, joined the Coast Guard in 1938.
Stationed at Pearl Harbor on December 7,
1941, Mr. Bell transmitted the first radio mes-
sage warning vessels and military institutions
of the attack on Pearl Harbor. He then served
as a member of the Navy’s Fleet Radio Unit
Pacific and helped break the secret Japanese
Imperial Navy code that led to U.S. Navy vic-
tories in the Pacific.
Myrtle Rae Holthaus Hazard Gambrill was
the first woman to serve on active duty in the
U.S. Coast Guard. She joined on January 7,
1918, before women could vote. Ms. Gambrill
served as an electrician at Coast Guard head-
quarters and was honorably discharged in No-
vember 1919.
Olivia Hooker, Dorothy Winifred Byrd, Julia
Watson Mosley Shields, Aileen Anita Cooke
Moore, and Yvonne Cumberbatch were the
first five African-American women to serve as
Coast Guard service members during World
War II, as part of the ‘‘Semper Paratus, Al-
ways Ready’’ (SPARs) program. Dr. Hooker
was the first one in this group to enlist in the
U.S. Guard in February 1945, and she was
one of the last known survivors of the Tulsa
race riots of 1921 .
Their sister SPARs included other trail-
blazers: Cuban-American Mary Rivero and
Filipina-American Florence Finch Smith. Ms.
Smith joined the SPARs after surviving torture
and incarceration at the hands of the Japa-
nese during the occupation of the Philippines.
Admiral Vivian Crea, former Vice Com-
mandant, is the highest-ranking woman in
Coast Guard history. Admiral Crea joined the
service in 1973, and in 2000, she became the
first female Admiral in the U.S. Coast Guard.
Admiral Crea was selected as Vice Com-
mandant in 2006.
Master Chief Vince Patton became the high-
est ranking African-American Coast Guard en-
listed member when he was selected in 1998
to be the Eighth Master Chief Petty Officer of
the U.S. Coast Guard. He was the senior en-
listed advisor on workforce and personnel
issues.
Henry Garcia, born in Puerto Rico, became
the first underrepresented minority to receive
an officer’s commission in 1928. Ten years
later in 1938, he took command of the Coast
Guard Cutter Morris and became the first His-
panic-American to command a Coast Guard
cutter.
In 1991, Katherine Faverey took command
of Coast Guard Cutter Bainbridge Island, be-
coming the first Hispanic-American woman to
command a cutter.
Happy birthday, U.S. Coast Guard. You
consist of a diverse group of men and women,
and your diversity has been essential to your
success.

HONORING DR. MARY BETH
MUSKIN
HON. DON BACON
OF NEBRASKA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, July 26, 2019
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Dr. Mary Beth Muskin for her lifetime
of exceptional service and dedication to our
community. Dr. Muskin devoted nearly four
decades to education and her impact on the
Omaha community has benefitted thousands
and is an inspiration for all Nebraskans.
Dr. Muskin received her Bachelor of
Science from the University of Nebraska in El-
ementary and Pre-School Education. She
went on to obtain her Master of Science in
Counseling from Johns Hopkins University and
returned to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
to get her PhD in Philosophy, with an empha-
sis in Adult and Continuing Education.
Dr. Muskin began her career in education
while teaching in the Baltimore Public Schools.
One day, a man was trying to break into her
classroom of thirty-six children. Dr. Muskin will
always remember the moment when she knew
she had to stop the invasion and slammed the
window ultimately breaking his arm. That act
of bravery marked the beginning of her incred-
ible career serving inner city students and she
has loved every minute of that service.
Dr. Muskin eventually moved back to
Omaha to marry Bruce Muskin and together
that have raised three outstanding children, all
of whom who have a passion for education
and social justice. Upon returning to Ne-
braska, she spent thirty-six years working for
the Omaha Public Schools across the entire
District, and the last six as Director of Coun-
seling at Omaha South High School.
Following an extraordinary career in edu-
cation, Dr. Muskin became the Regional Direc-
tor of the Anti-Defamation League Plains
States Region in 2015 and was excited to use
her skills in classroom teaching to further the
community education mission of the ADL.
The Anti-Defamation League Plains States
region covers Nebraska, Iowa and Kansas.
Their mission is to Protect, Investigate and
Educate and the ADL is committed to ad-
dressing the issues of prejudice and discrimi-
nation that affect all people. They work to ‘‘se-
cure justice and fair treatment of all citizens.’’
One of the programs of the Anti-Defamation
League that Dr. Muksin proudly oversees is
No Place For Hate. Dr. Muskin and her team
have brought this program into schools across
the region. Under her leadership, the ADL has
worked tirelessly in metro Omaha schools,
helping to reduce bullying in partnerships with
students, parents, teachers, and administra-
tors in our districts. In addition, Dr. Muskin has
been a valued friend and counselor to my of-
fice and her wisdom regarding eucation and
combatting hate has been vital with respect to
our legislative efforts.
In her spare time, Dr. Muskin volunteers in
South Omaha, is involved in voter education
programs, and to date has registered over five
hundred and fifty voters.
The impact of Dr. Mary Beth Muskin on our
community and the surrounding states is
broad and her passion is contagious. Through
her example and leadership, she has built a
legacy that will endure for generations to
come. We all salute her for her work with stu-
dents, the community, law enforcement, and
legislators to make the world a better place.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ANTHONY
MARTINEZ
HON. TJ COX
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, July 26, 2019
Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the life of Anthony
Martinez, Sr., a true leader in Delano, Cali-
fornia and the Central Valley, who dedicated
his life to helping others.
Tony was born in Santa Paula, California
and grew up in Hanford where he graduated
from high school and then went on to pursue
higher education at Bakersfield College, San
Jose State, and Porterville College.
A selfless leader, Tony proudly served in
the California National Guard and the United
States Air Force.
Among his many jobs in life, Tony managed
a Thrifty’s Drug Store, but then with the sup-
port of his wife Pat, accomplished a lifelong
dream by opening the renowned Tony’s Pizza
in Delano, and also founded the Anthony Mar-
tinez Farmers Insurance Agency.
During his impressive 40-year business ca-
reer, Tony volunteered countless hours to his
community and served in elected roles as both
a city councilmember and as Mayor.
Tony passed away on June 20, 2019, but
he leaves behind a legacy that will live on.
