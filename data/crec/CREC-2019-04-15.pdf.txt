the following prayer:
Eternal Father, in recent weeks, You
have beautifully reminded us of Your

creation, as You have allowed the gift
of spring to bloom throughout our
country, and especially in our Capital
City of Washington, where the cherry
blossom trees seem to take center
stage.
Thus, as we begin these delibera-

holy hand may enlighten and firmly
guide us as we seek to preserve and
promote the dignity and life of all of
our people.
May this body of legislators always
recognize it is their sworn vocation to
assist You in administering Your be-

We ask this grace, as we do all fa-
vors, in Your most holy and loving
name.
Amen.

CELEBRATING SENIOR DIRECTOR
RICK PHILLIPS 35 YEARS OF
WORK AT SEMPRA ENERGY
UTILITIES COMPANIES (SOCALGAS
& SDG&E)
HON. JIMMY GOMEZ
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 15, 2019
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Rick Phillips, Senior Director of the
Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan (PSEP) at
SoCalGas, one of the nation’s largest natural
gas distribution companies. As the Sr. Director
of PSEP, Mr. Phillips oversees a multi-year,
three-billion-dollar project that advances
SoCalGas’ natural gas transmission. This
project requires him to oversee a team of 800
contractors and manage 230 projects that
range from San Diego to Visalia.
In over 35 years at Sempra Energy utilities
companies (SoCalGas & SDG&E), Mr. Phillips
has held various leadership roles such as Di-
rector of Engineering, Director of Supply Man-
agement, Director of Regional Operations, and
Director of Underground Storage. As Program
Director in IT, Mr. Phillips led a half-billion dol-
lar IT upgrade project that made improve-
ments to GIS, call centers, and field workforce
applications.
Previously, Mr. Phillips graduated cum laude
with a bachelor’s degree in Engineering from
UC Irvine, and he served on the UC Riverside
Foundation Board of Trustees and the Industry
Advisory Board for UC Riverside’s Anderson
School of Management.
Mr. Phillips has demonstrated tremendous
leadership within his company and the 34th
Congressional district through his direct in-
volvement in community projects, and by men-
toring young professionals at the Gas Com-
pany. It is leaders like him that keep paving
the path for future generations to continue the
positive impacts in our communities.
I ask all members to join with me in com-
mending Mr. Phillips for his 35 years of hard
work, leadership, and mentorship of young
professionals at SoCalGas & SDG&E.

HONORING RICHARD NACLERIO
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 15, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I want to take
a moment to recognize a dedicated member
of the community and a friend, Mr. Richard
Naclerio. Richard is an honoree at this year’s
J.A.D.E. 35th Annual Scholarship Dinner and
he is most deserving of the recognition.
Born in the Bronx to Elizabeth and
Salvatore Naclerio, Richard is one of ten chil-
dren. He attended Christopher Columbus High
School and graduated from Villanova Univer-
sity with a Bachelor of Science in Economics.
Following school, the United States Army
called, and Richard served with the 7th Infan-
try G2 Section in Korea before receiving an
Honorable Discharge.
Richard’s involvement and dedication to
many charities and organizations is well docu-
mented, and they have filled his years with
many wonderful memories. He has been affili-
ated with Montefiore Sound Shore Medical
Health Systems; he served as Vice President
on the Board of Trustees of Montefiore Mount
Vernon Hospital; and he is a former Trustee of
Calvary Hospital and Our Lady of Mercy Hos-
pital. Richard is also a retired Director of Pa-
triot National Bank. He served on the Board of
the Bronx Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children, is a member of the Bronx Cham-
ber of Commerce and is an Ellis Island Medal
of Honor recipient. Richard is also the creator
of the Richard and Barbara Naclerio Faculty
Scholars Program.
Outside of charity work and his day job as
CEO of Maestro’s Catering Hall, Richard en-
joys spending time with his lovely wife, Bar-
bara, with whom he is celebrating 59 wonder-
ful years of marriage. Together they live in
Pelham and are very proud of their family,
which includes an astounding 12 grand-
children whom they love dearly.
Madam Speaker, few have done more to
strengthen New York’s 16th Congressional
District over the years than Richard Naclerio.
As he is honored this year by J.A.D.E. I want
to take the opportunity to congratulate him for
all his accomplishments and thank him for all
he has done to better our community.

RUTH HEIDE TRIBUTE
HON. SCOTT R. TIPTON
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 15, 2019
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize an exceptional journalist of the
Valley Courier, Ruth Heide in Alamosa, Colo-
rado.
Ruth recently retired after dedicating an im-
pressive 35 years to the news business. Ruth
has chronicled the events of the San Luis Val-
ley since 1983 and has since become one of
the most highly regarded, significant and re-
spected journalists in Colorado. Her career
began with the Del Norte Prospector and after
a couple years, she joined the Valley Courier
as a staff reporter in December 1985. She
worked herself up to an editor in mid-2008,
where she has spent the last 11 years at the
helm of the paper.
Ruth’s success as a journalist derives from
her deep understanding of the many issues
impacting the San Luis Valley. During her ca-
reer, Ruth took deep dives into local affairs
covering stories spanning from crime, food
borne disease outbreaks, and major wildfires
in the area. Ruth always ensured that her sto-
ries were told objectively and completely. I es-
pecially appreciated her diligent coverage of
water issues affecting the San Luis Valley
where I was reassured by her commitment to
getting the details right. The Courier is the go-
to news source for many in the San Luis Val-
ley because of Ruth’s leadership, commitment
to the truth and high standards. She continued
to serve the community through many
changes in the print news industry allowing
the Courier to thrive while other publications
have not weathered so well.
Ruth’s commitment to the highest journal-
istic standards have received high praise from
her colleagues who noted that her love for the
news was second only to her love and devo-
tion for her community, faith, and family. Ruth
has spent her life in service to others, she is
a well-respected member of the Alamosa com-
munity and the Valley Courier and her legacy
in this region is significant. Her reputation as
a reliable resource for the community was not
limited to the San Luis Valley. She garnered
statewide recognition recently when Colorado
established March 30th as Ruth Heide Day.
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to recognize
Ruth Heide here today and on behalf of the
people of the San Luis Valley, Colorado’s
Third District, and the entire state, I want to
thank her for all of her years of journalistic ex-
cellence. I wish Ruth the very best as she be-
gins her next chapter.

HONORING FRIENDSHIP WORSHIP
CENTER 75TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 15, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor a wonderful institution in Mount Vernon,
the Friendship Worship Center, which this
year celebrates its remarkable 75th Anniver-
sary in the community.
Friendship Worship empowers people with
solid biblical principles, while advocating for
justice, fairness, and delivering social services.
The story of Friendship Worship begins in
1942, when a group of women from the Mount
Vernon Community led by Mother Lillian
Davis, an active missionary, began a Freewill
Baptist Mission work. For two years these
women shared in their homes the message
and work of Christ. In 1944, the officials of the
Freewill Baptist Conference came and officially
organized the St. Paul Freewill Baptist Church
of Mount Vernon, New York. Around the late
1940s the church was renamed Little Friend-
ship United American Freewill Baptist Church.
In 1950, Little Friendship became incorporated
in the State of New York. During those early
stages of the church development many dif-
ferent ministers and layperson held the church
together. This was done under the supervision
of the late Rev. N.E. Sharp, Moderator of the
Northern Annual Conference of the United
American Freewill Baptist Church. The first
elected pastor of this church was the late Rev.
B.T. Johnson who led the church from 1948–
1956. During his tenure Little Friendship pur-
chased its church building at 358 South Ninth
Avenue, Mount Vernon, New York. The suc-
cessions of Pastors were Rev. S.H. Wylie
1956–1957, Rev. H. Miller 1957–1958, Rev.
O. E. Davis 1958–1959, Rev. Otis Park 1959–
1983, Rev. Joe L. Brown 1983–1988, and fi-
nally my friend Elder C. Nathan Edwers 1988
to present. In 1997, the church name was
changed, and Corporation papers were
amended to Friendship Unified Freewill Baptist
Church of Mount Vernon, New York.
Under the strong leadership of Pastor
Edwers many new programs were established.

church, over $200,000 has been done in ren-
ovations since 1989. In August 1998 Pastor C.
Nathan Edwers was led by the Lord to move
Friendship Unified Freewill Baptist Church into
$1.3 million edifice located at 261 East Lincoln
Avenue in Mount Vernon at present. The
church seating capacity is 1,200.
In September 1998 the church was re-
named Friendship Worship Center, The Family
Center. In March 20, 1999 Pastor Edwers was
consecrated as a Bishop. Friendship Worship
Center is now on the cutting edge of the 21st
Century and every day its parishioners are
helping to improve the Mount Vernon commu-
nity and beyond.
On this special occasion, I want to congratu-
late the entire Friendship Worship Center
community on 75 amazing years of love and
service.

JULIE NORTON DEPARTS THE
HIGH DESERT PHOENIX FOUNDA-
TION
HON. PAUL COOK
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 15, 2019
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the incredible work of Julie Norton,
who has served as the Executive Director of
the High Desert Phoenix Foundation for the
past ten years. The Phoenix Foundation pro-
vides financial assistance to families in the
High Desert who have lost a loved one due to
an accident, criminal act, or suicide.
Julie has served as Executive Director for
the ten years that the Phoenix Foundation has
been in existence. She is the founding mem-
ber of the Foundation, and was motivated to
create it after dealing with a tragic loss in her
personal life. Over her ten years as executive
director, Julie has helped well over 500 fami-
lies lay their loved ones to rest. Additionally,
Julie helped start the HALOS (Healing Loved
Ones After Suicide) Program, which is a peer
support group for those affected by the suicide
of a friend or family member.
Julie has had an incredible impact on thou-
sands of people during some of their toughest
and most vulnerable moments, and I cannot
thank her enough for all the work she has put
in over the last ten years to make the Phoenix
Foundation the success it is today. I offer my
sincere congratulations to her for a decade as
Executive Director of the High Desert Phoenix
Foundation and I am certain that wherever
she goes she will continue to have a positive
impact on people’s lives.

of Arts in Educational Leadership and Admin-
istration at California State University, Bakers-
field. He then returned home to Ridgecrest,
beginning a career in education at Murray
Middle School, where he taught and coached
for ten years, then served as the school’s Vice
Principal for four years, and finally as Murray
Middle’s Principal for ten years. Throughout
his career as an educator, Ernie achieved ex-
tensive knowledge of the interworking and im-
portance of education through his participation
on SSUSD leadership committees and peer
review panels. And it was by tackling issues
critical to the district, such as student safety,
collective bargaining, budgetary issues, and
accreditation, that Ernie seamlessly
transitioned from the classroom to SSUSD ad-
ministration. In 2014, Ernie accepted the posi-
tion of Superintendent of Sierra Sands Unified
School District, a position that capped a life-
long career dedicated to education in the In-
dian Wells Valley. As Superintendent, Ernie
led and successfully pushed to renovate and
modernize Murray Middle School and Bur-
roughs High School, and spearheaded the ef-
fort to secure funding for the construction of
Richmond Elementary School. Ernie’s legacy
will be defined not only by his esteemed ca-
reer as an educator to countless students, but
by the fruits of his tireless advocacy for quality
education in the Indian Wells Valley on future
generations of students.
I know Ernie Bell as a man of his word and
as a public servant who tirelessly advocated
for the needs of our community’s students and
teachers better than almost anyone. I know
that despite his retirement, he will remain just
as active in the Ridgecrest community as
ever. On behalf of a grateful community, I
wish Ernie, his wife, Deanne, and their chil-
dren, Jacob, Zachary, and Rebecca, all the
best as they begin this new chapter of his life.

HONORING JILL SPIELER
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 15, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, it is my
pleasure to honor a woman who has done a
tremendous amount to build and strengthen
the Scarsdale community in my district, Ms.
Jill Spieler, this year’s recipient of the pres-
tigious Scarsdale Bowl Award.
For over 70 years, the Scarsdale Bowl has
been awarded a Scarsdale resident who ‘‘has
given unselfishly of time, energy, and effort to
the civic welfare of the community.’’ Nothing
could better describe Jill. She has a long and
distinguished record of volunteer services to
Scarsdale and well beyond.
Jill began her service to Scarsdale in 1981
as a founding member of Kids B.A.S.E. and
The Little School. She served as a board
member from 1983 to 1988, then became
President of the Board where she served two
terms. She continued on the board till 1998,
and during her tenure she provided out-
standing leadership, especially during some
difficult times. Jill continued her commitment to
the community by serving on the Scarsdale
Village Board of Ethics, the Advisory Council
on Youth, and the Village Parks and Recre-
ation Council, becoming Chair of the Recre-
ation Committee in 2000. She was also active
member of the League of Women Voters and
chaired the Voter Service Committee.
There are many other examples of Jill’s
community involvement, but they are too many
to mention. She is, without question, a highly
respected, trusted, insightful and collaborative
community leader who has contributed a great
deal to Scarsdale. Jill’s selfless contribution of
time and energy to community affairs epito-
mizes the principles symbolized by the
Scarsdale Bowl.
Madam Speaker, the Bowl Award is consid-
ered the highest and most prestigious recogni-
tion given for volunteer service in Scarsdale. It
is no surprise then that this year that award is
going to Jill Spieler. As Member of Congress
representing Scarsdale, I want to congratulate
Jill on receiving this wonderful honor and
thank her for her years of dedicated service to
the community.

Monday, April 15, 2019
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate the SUNY Plattsburgh
Women’s Hockey Team for winning their Sev-
enth NCAA Division III National Champion-

sion III Women’s Hockey championship titles,

enough, they also finished the season on an
eighteen-game winning streak, tying the pro-
gram record for most wins in a single season
with a near perfect 29–2 overall record.
On behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional
District, I want to congratulate every member
of the team, their families and the coaching
staff on this impressive accomplishment. The
Cardinals make the North Country very proud.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E468 April 15, 2019
In 1959, a group of students in the music
department at Shaw Junior High School
formed El Corols, the first rhythm and blues
band in the District of Columbia. El Corols was
highly sought-after for school and private par-
ties all over the city and beyond. The band
performed for many charitable and community
organizations throughout the city. During the
summer, the group spent the majority of its
time performing at Carr’s Beach, a public
beach for African Americans in Annapolis,
Maryland. (African Americans were not wel-
come at any of the ‘‘white’’ beaches. Although
our nation was segregated, many found com-
fort and joy through the vibrant musical talents
of El Corols.)
The band consisted of teenagers, yet the
members were honored and privileged to be
the ‘‘house band’’ at the beach. The band was
presented with opportunities to perform and
accompanied many of the famous stars of that
era, including Dionne Warwick, Patti LaBelle
and the Bluebells, Bobby ‘‘Blue’’ Bland, Billy
Stewart, Gene Chandler, and James Brown, to
name a few. As teenagers, the band members
had no idea that they were making history.
They were simply excited about playing music
and entertaining.
The apex of El Corols’ experience was their
performance with Nat King Cole in 1963 at
Eastern High School, where United States At-
torney General Robert F. Kennedy was an
honored guest. Another highlight of El Corols’
experience was the invitation to perform at the
Debutante Cotillion of New York Socialite
Fernanda Wetherhill Wannamaker in South
Hampton, Long Island.
As the members of El Corols reflect on their
teenage years, they continue to cherish the
lifelong memories and experiences they were
afforded simply due to their dedication to and
love of music.
El Corols is indebted to its manager, Cap-
tain William Rumsey, who was Dunbar High
School’s Military Science Teacher. Captain
Rumsey later became the Principal of McKin-
ley Technical High School, and upon his re-
tirement from the public school system, he be-
came Director of the District of Columbia
Parks and Recreation Department. Captain
Rumsey was a strict disciplinarian and as-
sured the band members’ parents that they
were in capable hands and would be well
cared for under his management. Captain
Rumsey never failed in his commitment to the
band and stands in a proud space in history
alongside the members of El Corols.
Madam Speaker, it is my honor today to
recognize the rich history of El Corols on the
occasion of its 60th reunion. I ask my col-
leagues to join me in this recognition.

HONORING DAVID M.C. STERN
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 15, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor a distinguished member of the
Edgemont community in my district, Mr. David
M.C. Stern, who this year is being honored by
the Edgemont Community Council with their
Silver Bowl Award for Distinguished Commu-
nity Service.
David served two terms on the school
board, from 2010 to 2016, was president in
2015–2016, and made his mark on the cur-
riculum, audit and superintendent search com-
mittees, as well as liaison to the Edgemont
School Foundation and the Scarsdale Teach-
ers Institute. He has coached over 20 seasons
of local youth sports—soccer, lacrosse, bas-
ketball and tee-ball—and now serves as presi-
dent of Edgemont Youth Lacrosse. In the
schools, David has taught Great Books and
volunteered in the Wiggleworks reading pro-
gram. He currently sits on the School Board
Nominating Committee and is a former direc-
tor of the ECC. David has been an assistant
Cub Scouts den leader, and he has been a
long-time member of Greenville Fire District’s
volunteer fire company, where he has served
as a volunteer firefighter.
David also currently serves as chairman of
the board of Westchester Institute for Human
Development, a Valhalla-based organization
that works with developmentally disabled men
and women, and member of the board of
MusicCorps/Renovation in Music Education in
Washington D.C., which uses music to help
wounded military veterans recover. David has
also been a director of the Scarsdale-
Edgemont United Way, and a member of the
Woodlands Community Temple School Board.
Professionally, David runs a consulting firm
that provides strategic business advisory serv-
ices to healthcare organizations and investors.
After graduating from Edgemont in 1982,
David went on to get a BA and an MBA from
Yale. David lives on Old Army Road with his
wife Mary Elizabeth and their children Kasey,
Gavin and Fiona.
As you can see Madam Speaker, David
Stern is a very active member of the commu-
nity who is most deserving of this wonderful
recognition from the Edgemont Community
Council. I want to congratulate him on this
honor.

CELEBRATING THE DEDICATION
OF THE HOBE SOUND NATIONAL
WILDLIFE REFUGE IN HONOR OF
NATHANIEL P. REED
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 15, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the dedication of the Hobe
Sound National Wildlife Refuge in honor of the
late Nathaniel P. Reed. Nathaniel, who was
known as Nat, was an enviromnentalist and
champion of Florida’s environment. He served
as Assistant Secretary of Fish, Wildlife, and
Parks at the United States Department of the
Interior from 1971 to 1977, under President
Richard Nixon and President Gerald Ford.
Furthermore, had it not been for Nathaniel, our
nation would be without the Marine Mammals
Protection Act, the intact and expanded Red-
woods National Park, the Endangered Species
Act and the Clean Water Act.
Originally born in New York City, Nathaniel
spent much of his time growing up in Hobe
Sound, Florida. His concern for the environ-
ment developed from his firsthand experience
with the threat of overpopulation to Florida’s
natural landscape and by the example of his
mother, who was a lead organizer in opposing
the development of a theme park on an island
near their home.
Nathaniel started his career in the family
real estate and hotel business in Florida,
where his concern for the environment steered
him into public service. He went on to serve
six Florida governors.
He was a member of many environmental
advocacy groups, most notably the 1000
Friends of Florida, an organization which he
founded, and served as president and chair-
man. He also served on the boards of the Ev-
erglades Foundation (which he helped found),
the Nature Conservancy, the Atlantic Salmon
Federation, the Natural Resources Defense
Council, the National Audubon Society, Yel-
lowstone National Park, the National Geo-
graphic Society, and the South Florida Water
Management District. Throughout his career,
he was one of the most eloquent and effective
advocates for fish, wildlife and nature of the
20th and 21st centuries.
The Hobe Sound National Wildlife refuge is
a part of the United States National Wildlife
Refuge system, and is the type of vulnerable
land Nathaniel dedicated his life to protecting.
The newly named Nathaniel P. Reed Hobe
Sound National Wildlife Refuge will rightly
honor his life’s work.
Madam Speaker, Nathaniel was a power-
house of Florida politics, but more than that,
he was a dear friend and a mentor to me, as
well as to countless others. During his six dec-
ades of activism, he was a tireless crusader
for the environment and the Everglades. Na-
thaniel inspired generations of conservation-
ists, and what he did for America’s River of
Grass is immeasurable. Hobe Sound rep-
resents the starting place of Nathaniel’s love
for our nation’s environment, and this dedica-
tion of the Hobe Sound National Wildlife Ref-
uge in his honor will allow his life and legacy
to always endure.

REGARDING THE DESIGNATION OF
IRAN’S ISLAMIC REVOLU-

FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZA-
TION
HON. TOM McCLINTOCK
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 15, 2019
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD the following release
which includes the statement by Mrs. Maryam
Rajavi, the President-elect of the National
Council of Resistance of Iran, regarding the
designation of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps (IRGC) as a Foreign Terrorist
Organization.
Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, the President-elect of
the National Council of Resistance of Iran, de-
scribed the inclusion of the suppressive Revo-
lutionary Guards (IRGC) in the State Depart-
ment’s list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations
(FTO) as a long-standing and rightful demand
of the Iranian Resistance, an imperative for
Middle East security, peace, and stability, and
an urgent and necessary step to end war and
terrorism throughout the region and the world.
‘‘This action, which was long overdue,
should now be completed by designating the
Iranian regime’s Ministry of Intelligence and
Security (MOIS),’’ Mrs. Rajavi added.
The Revolutionary Guard Corps, which does
not even carry Iran in its official name, con-
stitutes the pillar of the velayat-e faqih regime

(absolute clerical rule), is the main apparatus
of repression, the primary driver of war and
export of terrorism, and responsible for pur-
suing nuclear weapons and missile projects.
The IRGC also controls the lion’s share of
Iran’s economy.
It is no wonder that the religious fascism rul-
ing Iran, its apologists and mercenaries have
become terrified of IRGC ’s designation.
Mrs. Rajavi emphasized that if the disas-
trous policy of appeasement had not provided
so much freedom of action to the mullahs and
the Revolutionary Guards over the past dec-
ades, the Iranian regime could not have
caused so much bloodshed in Iraq, Syria. Leb-
anon, Yemen and Afghanistan.
She emphasized that in the interest of the
Iranian people as well as regional peace and
security, the European Union must designate
the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist entity,
adding that the ultimate solution to rid the
world of the ruling theocracy in Iran is for the
Iranian people and the Resistance to change
the illegitimate caliphate, cloaked under the
veneer of Shia and Islam.
On behalf of the Iranian Resistance which
has called for an arms and oil embargo on
Iran’s religious dictatorship since 1981, Mrs.
Rajavi reiterated the need to take the following
measures:
1. Recognizing the right of the Iranian peo-
ple and the Resistance to overthrow the ruling
religious fascism and to establish freedom.
2. Placing the Ministry of Intelligence and
Security (MOIS) and other organs of suppres-
sion and export of terrorism and fundamen-
talism on State Department’s FTO list as well
as on the EU’s terror watch list.
3. Expelling the agents of the MOIS and the
terrorist Quds Force from the United States
and Europe.
4. Referring the dossier on the Iranian re-
gime’s human rights violations and the mas-
sacre of political prisoners to the United Na-
tions Security Council and the International
Court of Justice.
5. Expelling the illegitimate clerical regime
from the UN and recognizing the Iranian Re-
sistance as the true representative of the Ira-
nian people.
6. Evicting the Iranian regime and its forces
from Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon and Af-
ghanistan.

HONORING REVEREND DR. C. NA-
THAN EDWERS 30TH PASTORAL
ANNIVERSARY
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 15, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, It is my sin-
cere honor to recognize a dear friend, Rev-
erend Dr. Collie Nathan Edwers, who this year
celebrates his 30th Pastoral Anniversary at the
Friendship Worship Center in Mount Vernon.
Nathan, as he is best known, was born in
Newark, New Jersey to the union of Bishop
Collie Edwers and the late Mother Dorothy
Edwers. He is the third child born to this family
of seven. He was raised in the quiet suburban
community of North Edison, New Jersey. He
was educated in the Edison High School sys-
tem until his parents relocated to Metuchen,
New Jersey during his junior year of High
School. It was during this time of his adoles-
cent years that Nathan felt and responded to
the call of God on his life. At the age of six-
teen, Nathan preached his initial sermon at St.
Mark U.F.W. Baptist Church, the same church
where his father baptized him.
Upon High School graduation, Nathan con-
tinued his education through the encourage-
ment of his parents. Nathan was directed to
pursue his undergraduate education at North-
eastern Bible College in Essex Falls, New Jer-
sey. During his senior year of study, Nathan
was approached by the officers of Calvary
U.F.W. Baptist Church to serve as their next
Pastor. In May of 1983, Nathan was elected
as their Pastor and assumed that responsi-
bility on the Fifth Sunday. During this time Na-
than decided against the advice of his father,
to discontinue his education at Northeastern
Bible College in order to move full attention to
the Church. During his six years tenure as
Pastor, Nathan was very fortunate to meet his
darling wife, Aro Denise Harper. Out of this
union were born two, children, Eric and Sherri.
Both of his children are adults and are suc-
cessful in their life choice career.
In January 1989, Nathan answered the call
as the First Family of Little Friendship Unified
Free Will Baptist Church. During his ministry
at Friendship Church, the Lord added to his
family his son, Eric Nathan Edwers. In Octo-
ber of 1997, Pastor Edwers began the process
to acquire Temple Emanuel Jewish Center in
Mount Vernon, which was up for sale. In Janu-
ary 1998 the church agreed to modify its
name by removing the word ‘‘little’’ from its
former name known as ‘‘Little Friendship Uni-
fied Free Will Baptist Church’’. Bishop Edwers
led the church into a $1.3 million dollar reloca-
tion expansion program, and on August 16,
1998 he marched the ‘‘Friendship Unified Free
Will Baptist Church’’ and hundreds of friends
into their new home, renamed the Friendship
Worship Center in September 1998.
Madam Speaker, Friendship Worship has
grown by leaps and bounds thanks to Nathan
and Denise Edwers. On this special occasion,
I want to congratulate the pastor on 30 won-
derful years, and thank him for all he has
done in the community.

PARACHUTE INFANTRY REGI-
MENT OF THE 82ND AIRBORNE
HON. DANIEL MEUSER
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 15, 2019
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor and remember the sacrifice of Fr. Ig-
natius Maternowski, a Franciscan Friar Con-
ventual and Chaplain to the 508th Parachute
Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne during
the Second World War. Fr. Ignatius is the only
chaplain killed in action during the D-Day inva-
sion in Normandy, France.
Fr. Ignatius and his regiment parachuted
into Normandy at 1:30 a.m. on D-Day, June 6,
1944. In the ensuing days, he and the regi-
ment moved through Normandy and he min-
istered to the wounded and dead in heavy
hedgerow during the fighting. Fr. Ignatius was
compassionate and steadfast in his ministry,
successfully negotiating with German soldiers
to establish a joint aid station for both German
and American soldiers. On June 13th, one
week after landing in France, he was killed by
a German sniper while trying to find a doctor
to treat a wounded comrade.
Fr. Ignatius’ story expresses the courage of
the brave individuals who served, and who
continue to serve, our country as military
chaplains. These individuals share in the sac-
rifice of our men and women in the Armed
Forces and on behalf of the U.S. House of
Representatives, and the constituents of
Pennsylvania’s Ninth Congressional District, I
am proud to honor the heroism of one such as
Fr. Ignatius Maternowski.

HONORING APRIL BLANKENSHIP
HON. KEVIN BRADY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 15, 2019
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
celebrate the life of April Blankenship, a long-
time and outstanding staffer for the Committee
on Ways and Means and my personal office,
who passed away this morning.
April is a tireless, trusted colleague and a
friend to so many. In her many years of serv-
ice on Capitol Hill, she has been a key part of
dozens of personal and committee offices, in-
cluding both my personal office and the staff
of the Committee on Ways and Means. She
handled issues that involve sensitive per-
sonnel matters with grace, precision, confiden-
tiality, and a deft personal touch. She dealt
with numbers, but really what she managed
was people—the people and committees that
help run this place on behalf of taxpayers. And
she did it all with a smile on her face and a
joy for service. April is one of the true unsung
heroes around these halls, and I am proud to
call her a trusted colleague and friend.
Beyond her many professional skills and ac-
complishments, I know April is even more
proud of her role as a mother. Whether help-
ing her sons, Hunter, Dakota, and Tucker, sell
Boy Scout candy to friends and colleagues or
bragging on the boys’ achievements in school
or church groups, her smile told you all you
needed to know—that she was an intensely
proud mother, and rightfully so. She also in-
vested her deep faith in her family, and I know
that faith has helped maintain her through the
years she has heroically battled her illness.
On behalf of the entire Committee on Ways
and Means, I offer our sincerest condolences
to Tim, Hunter, Dakota, Tucker and her entire
family on April’s passing. I thank them for
sharing April with us for so many years of out-
standing service to the Committee, its Mem-
bers, and our great country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E470 April 15, 2019
Peter has always believed deeply in our de-
mocracy and the power of public service.
That’s why he ran for Mayor of Hastings some
16 years ago. His slogan, ‘‘Hastings Forward!’’
spoke to his consistent commitment to
progress. Though he took over during difficult
financial times for the village, Peter was able
to deftly navigate the choppy economic
waters. Abandoned buildings from Hastings’
industrial past were replaced with storefronts
that our now local hot spots. The beautiful wa-
terfront hugging the Hastings coastline has
been revitalized. Parks that were once run
down have been transformed. All of this hap-
pened under Peter’s leadership, and all of it
happened while the village’s finances steadily
improved. Peter grew the Hastings’ rainy-day
fund to $2 million, which has meant invest-
ments in infrastructure and funding for first re-
sponders can be met. But beyond quality of
life and economic development, Peter also
managed to focus on growing affordable hous-
ing options for residents, encourages local
sustainability initiatives, and even started a
Deer Immunocontraception Research Pro-
gram. How many local municipalities can say
that?
After 16 successful years, Peter chose not
to run for reelection as Mayor of Hastings.
Though the village is now in the excellent care
of new Mayor Nicola Armacost, we will all
miss Peter leading the way in Hastings. As a
partner in government, Peter was exceptional
to work with across the board. I want to con-
gratulate him on the years of hard work and
thank him for his ceaseless dedication to the
Hastings community.

HONORING THE LIFE AND ACCOM-
PLISHMENTS OF JERRY CUSTIN
HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 15, 2019
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor a local leader who has made
a tremendous impact in the Tampa Bay area
through a lifetime of public service. Colonel
Jerry Custin USAF (Ret.) prouldy served our
nation in the United States Air Force during
which he received advanced training, flew 130
combat missions over Laso and Vietnam, and
conducted defense analysis. He earned both
the Defense Superior Service Medal and Dis-
tinguished Flying Cross while serving in the
United States Air Force. He also worked with
the National Security Agency, and completed
his thirty-year career in public service as the
Director of the Office of Electronic Intelligence,
and the Chairman of the National Electronic
Intelligence Group.
After retirement, Jerry continued to serve
our community. He worked as an Outreach
Counselor for economically disadvantaged
youth through the Pinellas Workforce Develop-
ment Board. He then became the Business
Assistance Specialist for the Oldsmar Cham-
ber of Commerce, where he helped expand its
footprint into Hillsborough and Pasco counties
reconstituting the organization as the Upper
Tampa Bay Chamber of Commerce. He later
served as President/CEO of the Chamber and
developed the Florida Suncoast Manufacturing
Association (FSMA) which effectively serves
Hernando, Hillsborough, Pasco and Pinellas
Counties. Both organizations endeavor to en-
hance the regional workforce and ensure that
students are trained for post-secondary suc-
cess. With a fervent belief that the robust
manufacturing sector in the community—com-
prising nearly a third of area jobs and tax
base—could benefit by more technically ori-
ented services addressing current manufac-
turing practices and standards, increasingly
skilled workforce requirements and a more
comprehensive understanding of the avail-
ability of the varied products and services of-
fered across our local manufacturing base,
Colonel Custin has been instrumental in meet-
ing those needs through his work at FSMA.
On a personal note, Jerry is a trusted friend
and advisor. Whether in the Florida Legisla-
ture or my time in the U.S. Congress, Jerry
has been my go-to guy on issues related to
workforce, manufacturing, and the federal
budget among other subject matters. His
unrivaled work ethic, strength of character and
commitment to service is why he is held in
such high esteem in his beloved Oldsmar
community. I am honored to have him as a
constituent.

Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, today, I

Management (AAHAM).
The AAHAM was founded in 1968 and in-
corporated on February 20, 1973. The organi-
zation is dedicated to educating and advo-
cating for revenue cycle professionals who
work with healthcare patient accounts across
the country. It has grown to represent thirty-
one chapters with over 3,000 members and is
one of the best healthcare administrative man-
agement organizations serving patients
throughout the United States. Over its 50
years, AAHAM has grown from serving hos-
pital patient account managers to representing
professionals who serve across the healthcare
spectrum. They have made great contributions
to the welfare of patients and have fostered a
sense of fellowship and work to enhance the
quality of life for all patients navigating
healthcare financing.
Their strong and dedicated leaders and
membership have made the long tenure of
AAHAM possible and we are proud to con-

RECOGNIZING STUDENTS AT CON-
RAD WEISER HIGH SCHOOL FOR
SUCCESS IN C-SPAN STUDENT
CAM 2019
HON. DANIEL MEUSER
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 15, 2019
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is with
great respect that I rise today to honor ErieI
Gaylord, Sammy Saldana, and Melany Davila,
from Conrad Weiser High School in
Robesonia, Pennsylvania. These students par-
ticipated in the 2019 National C-SPAN Student
Cam Video Contest, and out of 3,000 entries,
their five-minute entry entitled, ‘‘America’s
Homeless,’’ earned them an honorable men-
tion.
This was certainly a profile in courage, as
one of the students, ErieI Gaylord, bravely
shared her experience with homelessness. In
telling her story, Eriel helped to raise aware-
ness and educate others on the many chal-
lenges faced by homeless youth—while en-
couraging other individuals and families, who
face similar challenges, to take advantage of
the resources available in our communities to
help them obtain housing security.
Each American faces their own challenges
and pursues their own passions; resilience,
however, is a defining characteristic of Penn-
sylvania’s Ninth District. No matter the chal-
lenges we face, the determination with which
we rise to meet them defines us more than
our trials themselves.
Eriel’s story and the context in which it is
presented should inspire each of us. Although
it is troubling that such daunting challenges
face young people in my own district, I am in-
spired by their engagement, advocacy, and
passion. It is an honor to recognize Eriel’s
bravery, and the work of these students. May
they continue to engage their passions, pur-
sue solutions, and showcase American resil-
ience.

HONORING MIKE GRECO
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 15, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I want to take
a moment to honor the life of a Bronx icon,
Mike Greco, the longtime owner of the famous
‘‘Mike’s Deli’’ on Arthur Avenue, who passed
away in late March at the age of 89.
Also known as the ‘‘Salami King’’ and
‘‘Mayor of Arthur Avenue,’’ Mike was a legend
in the community. Born on May 8, 1929 to
Luigi and Luisa Felice Greco, he came to
America in 1947 from his home in Calabria,
Italy with his twin brother, Joe, in a new suit
and $50 dollars to his name. He moved to the
Bronx, began working in a butcher shop, and
by the early 1950s had opened his very open
deli on Arthur Avenue.
Mike worked seven days a week starting at
6 a.m. to build Mike’s Deli into the huge des-
tination it became. For six decades, people
from all over made the pilgrimage to visit, for
both the wonderful food and for Mike himself.
As the New York Times wrote, ‘‘Mr. Greco
was larger than life.’’ The big personality, the
singing, the friendly banter was all part of his
mystique.
Of course, personality wasn’t the only draw
to Mike’s Deli. The food was renowned. A
well-earned reputation for quality preceded
Mike’s, with such favorites as the imported
cheese, sometimes aged for as long as 36
months, leading the way. Mike’s eggplant
parm is so delicious that it beat all the com-
petition on an episode of Food Network’s
‘‘Throwdown With Bobby Flay.’’ Mike’s fame
also extended to television, where he ap-
peared in a Ronzi commercial filmed on Arthur

Avenue, and on the stage, where an auto-
biographical play written by his son Marco was
performed.
Mike leaves two lasting legacies—the deli
and his wonderful family. He married Antoi-
nette Cappiello in 1951 and together they had
2 sons, David and Marco and two daughters,
Louisa Greco and Anna Greco Silvani. Mike is
also survived by his five grandchildren.
Mike Greco really was larger than life, and
his contributions to the Bronx have left an in-
delible mark. He will be deeply missed.

INTRODUCTION OF THE PROTEC-
TIONS IN CONSUMER LENDING
ACT
HON. JESÚS G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCÍA
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 15, 2019
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I
am proud to introduce the Protections in Con-
sumer Lending Act, which will empower the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to un-
derstand, analyze, and scrutinize abusive
practices by consumer lenders.
From mortgages to auto loans to credit ap-
plications, a pattern of discriminatory con-
sumer lending exists throughout the economy.
For instance, a recent study by the National
Fair Housing Alliance found that White testers
were offered better financing options on auto
loans than non-White testers 75 percent of the
time.
It is vital that the CFPB has access to the
richest possible data on data discrimination in
credit lending, and that is why I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting the Protec-
tions in Consumer Lending Act.
I encourage my colleagues to support this
bill.

On March 1, 2019, the Baytown Christian

HONORING WILLIAM MAYER
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 15, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I want to take
a moment to honor a pillar of the community
and friend, Mr. William Mayer, who this year is
being honored at the J.A.D.E. 35th Annual
Scholarship Dinner.
William was born on June 4, 1962 to Wil-
liam and Marjorie Zaino Mayer in Mount
Vernon, New York. His family was rooted in
catering and community affairs, and at a
young age William was encouraged to follow
in that tradition. While attending Iona Prep and
Iona college, he worked feverishly by his fa-
ther’s side at Mayer’s Parkway Catering and
at The Eastwood Manor, learning and growing
with every opportunity. William graduated from
Iona in 1984 with a B.A. in Business and went
on to own and operate Maestro’s Caterers and
the Eastwood Manor.
Over the years, William has become a very
well-respected member of the community, not
just for his business acumen, but also for his
tireless work and contributions. The list of or-
ganizations that have honored William over
the years is extensive and varied: The New
York City Public School system, The National
Council of Negro Women, The Bronx YMCA,
R.A.I.N., Williamsbridge NAACP, the
Scarsdale PBA, NYPD 47th Precinct Clergy
Coalition, North Bronx Little League, the Bronx
Chamber of Commerce, and the Bronx Orga-
nization for the Learning Disabled, just to
name a few. He has also been recognized by
the Bronx Borough President’s office, the
Transit Workers Union Local 100, and now, by
the U.S. House of Representatives.
William shares his commitment to commu-
nity and family involvement with his wife,
Kenia, and their children, Dustin and Riley.
The family currently resides in Ardsley and
during his spare time, William enjoys golfing at
the Wykagyl Country Club, where he is an ac-
tive member.
Madam Speaker, William Mayer has helped
to grow and build our community in countless
ways. As J.A.D.E. is set to honor him, I want
to take the opportunity to thank him for his
contributions, and congratulate him on receiv-
ing this well-deserved recognition.

HONORING THE LIFE AND ACCOM-
PLISHMENTS OF JERRY
BEVERLAND
HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, April 15, 2019
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor a local leader who has made
a tremendous impact on the Tampa Bay area
through a lifetime of public service, my dear
friend, former Oldsmar Mayor and City Council
Member Jerry Beverland. There has been no
greater champion for the city of Oldsmar than
Jerry and his lovely bride, Wanda. As both
Mayor and City Council member, Jerry has
been a lion during decades of City Council
meetings, never backing down on a stance
that he believed was in the best interests of
Oldsmar. He has been a lead voice on every
great endeavor for the city from the Sports
Complex to the Water Reclamation Facility to
the Oldsmar Library. His public service has
extended beyond the city limits, as he has
served as President of the Northeast Pinellas
County Water and Sewer Authority, and as a
member on the Tampa Bay Regional Planning
Council and the Pinellas County Council of
Mayors. Many of the initiatives he spear-
headed made a profound impact on our com-
munity. Pinellas County residents will benefit
for many years to come because of his leader-
ship. Jerry Beverland has given his time, tal-
ent and treasure to make Oldsmar a wonderful
place to live, work and play.
As a local historian, Mr. Beverland has
helped to preserve the rich cultural heritage
and tradition of our community, publishing four
books on the history of the City of Oldsmar.
Proceeds from the sale of his books have
benefitted the Oldsmar Library.
On a personal note, Jerry has been a trust-
ed friend and advisor of the Bilirakis family,
and me, in particular, for decades. His passion
for life and for the city of Oldsmar is inex-
tricably intertwined. The Beverlands have en-
dured life’s ups and downs for over sixty years
together in the city they call home. Yet
through their tribulations, no one has consist-
ently done so much, for so long, for the city.
Jerry Beverland’s integrity, wide breadth of
knowledge and commitment to service above
self is an example to which we all should as-
pire. I look forward to working with him and
Wanda to continue making the city of Oldsmar
a great place to live.
