PRAYER
Reverend Alisa Lasater Wailoo, Cap-
itol Hill United Methodist Church,
Washington, D.C., offered the following
prayer:
God of love, as we return to work
after Memorial Day, help us remember
these words of Jesus saying: ‘‘This is
my commandment that you love one
another. No one has greater love than
this, to lay down one’s life for one’s
friends.’’
Thank You, Lord, for all American
soldiers who put the welfare of others
ahead of their own and literally laid
down their lives for us. Comfort the
Gold Star families. Help us care for
them, for all soldiers who return
wounded by war’s traumas, and all in-
nocent civilians caught in war’s way.
Thank You, Lord, also for each civil
servant, Members of this House, their
staffs, the Clerk’s office, the Chaplain,
the custodians, and all who make the
work of the people’s House possible.
Help each of us lay down our fears,
pride, cynicism, and any sin keeping us
from the work You have for us, the
hard work of forging peace rather than
accepting war—be that battles across
the aisle, within our communities, or
around Your world.
Today, Lord, in all we do, help us live
Your commandment to love one an-
other.
Amen.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4174 May 28, 2019
I urge them not to object because
millions of people are at risk. This bill,
passed in January to the Senate, which
we passed some 3 or 4 weeks ago, needs
to be passed as soon as possible for the
welfare of our people in this country
who have been attacked by natural dis-
asters.
Madam Speaker, I urge my friends on
the other side of the aisle not to object.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
ervation is withdrawn.
Mr. MASSIE. Madam Speaker, re-
serving the right to object, if the
Speaker of this House felt that this
was must-pass legislation, the Speaker
of this House should have called for a
vote on this bill before sending every
Member of Congress on recess for 10
days, and I object.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objec-
tion is heard.
f

IN RECOGNITION OF THE SERVICE
OF DR. JOYCE KNESTRICK
HON. CONOR LAMB
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 28, 2019
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, it is with great
pride that I recognize a former constituent of
mine, Joyce Knestrick, PhD, C-FNP, APRN, of
Washington, Pennsylvania for her service over
the last two years as President of the Amer-
ican Association of Nurse Practitioners
(AANP).
Dr. Knestrick has an exemplary career of
service with over 30 years as a registered
nurse, of which she has spent 25 of those
years as a nationally board-certified family
nurse practitioner working in clinics that serve
low income and underserved populations both
in urban and rural Appalachian areas. As an
organizational leader, Dr. Knestrick has served
as an adjunct professor in organizational lead-
ership master’s programs.
She has served multiple clinical roles as a
family nurse practitioner, a nurse manager and
a registered nurse in critical care, medical sur-
gical, pediatric and long-term care settings.
She serves on several committees for the Na-
tional Organization of Nurse Practitioner Fac-
ulties and was elected as a Fellow of the
American Academy of Nurse Practitioners in
2007.
The American Association of Nurse Practi-
tioners is a national professional membership
organization representing over 270,00 nurse
practitioners nationally. Under Dr. Knestrick’s
tenure, AANP membership has grown to more
than 97,000 members, making AANP the larg-
est nurse practitioner organization in the
world. Dr. Knestrick has helped lead nurse
practitioners in transforming patient-centered
health care and has made tremendous strides
in ensuring that policy makers and the public
understand the care that nurse practitioners
provide to millions of Americans each year.
I urge my colleagues to join me in congratu-
lating Dr. Knestrick on a successful term as
President of the American Association of
Nurse Practitioners and in thanking her for the
excellent care she has and continues to pro-
vide to her patients and the nurse practitioner
profession.
f
MENSTRUAL HYGIENE DAY
RESOLUTION
HON. GRACE MENG
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 28, 2019
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise to com-
memorate today as Menstrual Hygiene Day.
Since 2013, Menstrual Hygiene Day has been
annually celebrated on May 28th to raise
awareness and catalyze political action around
the challenges menstruating women and girls
face around the world.
To support the goals and ideals of Men-
strual Hygiene Day, last week, I introduced H.
Res. 406. This legislation highlights that: 500
million women and girls around the world lack
adequate facilities for menstrual health and
hygiene management; 1 in 3 girls around the
world don’t have access to adequate toilets;
and many others face social and cultural re-
strictions during their periods. Additionally, dis-
placed women and adolescent girls—whether
by conflict, climate, or natural disaster—face
significant barriers to managing monthly men-
struation in a safe, private, and dignified man-
ner.
Here in the U.S., 25 million women live at
or below the poverty line, often without con-
sistent access to menstrual hygiene products.
A recent survey of low-income women in a
large U.S. city found that nearly two-thirds of
these women couldn’t afford menstrual hy-
giene products during the previous year. It is
estimated that a woman may spend over
$1,700 in her lifetime on tampons, a figure
that is multiplied for women who also support
children who are menstruating. Additionally, in-
carcerated women have illustrated that their
dignity has been compromised when they
seek to access menstrual hygiene products. I
have also heard heartbreaking stories from
girls whose schools fail to provide a supportive
environment for menstruating students, often
resulting in negative consequences.
Madam Speaker, no one should have to
choose between their period or their dignity.
No girl should be forced to miss school be-
cause of her period.
We must break the silence, raise aware-
ness, and change negative social norms sur-
rounding menstrual hygiene here in the U.S.
and around the world. While Menstrual Hy-
giene Day is commemorated today, we must
fight to ensure menstrual equity for all—each
and every day.
That is why this resolution recognizes the
barriers vulnerable populations face in access-
ing menstrual hygiene products, while encour-
aging greater research, as well as integration
of menstrual hygiene services in global hu-
manitarian and development activities abroad.
I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion and join me in commemorating Menstrual
Hygiene Day. I also urge support of H.R.
1882—the Menstrual Equity For All Act, a bill
which would comprehensively address the
challenges menstruating women and girls
face.
Madam Speaker, access to safe, affordable
menstrual hygiene products is not just a basic
health care right; it is a human right. Period.

BOB MAXWELL
HON. GREG WALDEN
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 28, 2019
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, before I
begin, I would like to recognize the life of an
American hero who I was honored to call my
friend, Bob Maxwell of Bend, Oregon, who
passed away this weekend at 98 years old.
Bob Maxwell represented the best of what
Oregon and America have to offer. Bob was
the oldest living Medal of Honor recipient, and
his gallantry was well known.
In the early morning hours of September 7,
1944 in France, Bob Maxwell threw his unpro-
tected body on a German hand grenade to
protect his comrades in WWII.
This unhesitating selflessness earned Bob
Maxwell the highest military honor, his second
Silver Star, a second Purple Heart, and a
Bronze Star.
For those who had the pleasure of knowing
Bob, they know that his bravery and heroism
were only matched by his kindness, warmth,
sense of humor, and humility.
Bob once said of his Medal of Honor that,
‘‘I’m not wearing the medal for any personal
deeds. I’m wearing it because it represents all
the casualties we had in the war. It represents
those that were killed defending their country
and the ideals that they believed in.’’
Like his fellow soldiers, Bob’s service will
forever be cherished in the country that he
sacrificed so much to protect.
Bob’s legacy will live on in the hearts and
minds of everyone he interacted with, espe-
cially the community in central Oregon where
Bob Maxwell was a pillar.
To the entire Maxwell family: Mylene and I
send our heartfelt condolences and prayers
during this difficult time.
My colleagues, please join me in thanking
Bob Maxwell for his service to the United
States on our behalf and on behalf of all
Americans.

Tuesday, May 28, 2019
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam
Speaker, the University of South Carolina Col-
lege of Pharmacy is the champion of
MEDISCA’s 2019 Student Pharmacist

A special congratulations to Rebecca

the teams were required to develop a unique
innovation piece to better serve patients, phar-
maceutics knowledge, and a pharmacy
compounding formulations portion where the
teams had to come up with a formulation and
then compound the medication based on a
unique patient scenario.’
These are ‘National Champion Scholars and
pharmacy student leaders that will soon be
making a difference within the pharmacy pro-
fession.’

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH
AMENDMENT
HON. GARY J. PALMER
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 28, 2019
Mr. PALMER. Madam Speaker, this year is
the 100th year anniversary of the United
States House of Representatives approving
the resolution for the 19th Amendment giving
women the right to vote. I have looked forward
to this day literally since my first day in Con-
gress because it holds very special meaning
for my wife’s family.
Prior to the 1920 election, sample ballots
were distributed in Boston. My wife Ann’s
great-grandmother, Abby Mayhew Cushing,
received a sample ballot that she used to pre-
pare for that election. After voting that day she
wrote the following note on the back side of
the sample ballot, ‘‘November 2, 1920 Cast
my first vote for President of these United
States.’’
Reading those words gives a sense of the
immense pride that Ms. Cushing felt, a sincere
sense of patriotism at the opportunity to par-
ticipate in the selection of the leaders who
would guide as she wrote, ‘‘these United
States.’’
These United States . . . even though
women had been denied the right to vote
since the beginning of our nation, there was
no sense of resentment from Ms. Cushing,
only a sense of great pride that comes from a
genuine love of country.
To be totally transparent, I should include
the rest of what she wrote on the back of her
sample ballot. She wrote, ‘‘Straight Republican
ticket. Smashing victory for Harding and Coo-
lidge. Abby Mayhew Cushing Age 67.’’
Almost three years later she added this
note: ‘‘President Harding died very suddenly
August 2nd 1923 in California. Burial in Mar-
ion, Ohio, Friday August 10th.’’
My wife and her family have held on to this
treasured piece of American history, with Ms.
Cushing’s simple yet inspiring words written
on the back, for almost 100 years as a re-
minder of how far our nation has come. It is
with great pride and honor that I share them
with this Congress on this 100th anniversary
of the passage of the House resolution to give
the women of America the right to vote.

2019 EXCELLENCE IN THEATRE
EDUCATION AWARD WINNER
MADELINE MICHEL
HON. DENVER RIGGLEMAN
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 28, 2019
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Madam Speaker, last
week The Tony Awards announced that The-
ater Director Madeline Michel from Monticello
High School in Charlottesville, Virginia, will re-
ceive the 2019 Excellence in Theatre Edu-
cation Award. A panel of judges comprised of
the American Theatre Wing, The Broadway
League, Carnegie Mellon University and other
leaders from the theatre industry selected
Michel from finalists across the nation.
The Excellence in Theatre Education Award
was co-founded in 2014 by the Tony Awards
and Carnegie Mellon University to recognize
exceptional drama teachers and to celebrate
arts education. Michel will receive her award
at the 73rd Annual Tony Awards on June 9,
2019, at Radio City Music Hall in New York
City.
Teachers throughout the nation have the
great responsibility of helping to develop the
next generation, and Madeline Michel has
demonstrated herself to be an exceptional ed-
ucator; having received praise from many stu-
dents, parents, and theater professionals
across our community. Michel has shown
through her creative, innovative approaches to
theater, that she is committed to both training
her students in theater arts and developing
their character and integrity outside of the
classroom.
Madam Speaker, I hope you’ll join me in
congratulating Madeline Michel for her out-
standing achievements in theater education for
the students of Virginia’s 5th Congressional
District.

ville Chapter on their 60th anniversary. I join
the entire Redstone Arsenal defense commu-
nity in congratulating the AUSA Redstone-

ville Chapter has been named the ‘‘Best
Chapter Overall of the Year’’ by AUSA Na-
tional for chapters in the largest category,
those over 1,350 members.

RECOGNIZING THE JROTC MEMO-
RIAL DAY ASSEMBLY AND WIL-
LIAM MCKINLEY PORTRAIT
DEDICATION
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 28, 2019
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I proudly rise to acknowledge the JROTC
Memorial Day Recognition Assembly and the
portrait dedication of former President William
McKinley, who was assassinated only blocks
away from McKinley High School here in Buf-
falo in 1901. The portrait was created by
McKinley High School teacher assistant and
Army Veteran, Reverend William C. Cobb, Jr.,
who generously donated his drawing to the
school for this Memorial Day assembly hon-
oring our fallen service members.
Rev. Cobb was born in Orlando, Florida and
joined the United States Army in 1962. During
his service, he was recognized as ‘‘Soldier of
the Year’’ in 1963. He received an honorable
discharge and began pursuing a career in en-
tertainment in Harlem, New York.
In 1977, he relocated to Buffalo, New York
to answer his call to the Christian Ministry. To
prepare for his call to Christian Discipleship,
he joined the Christian family of Bethel African
Methodist Episcopal Church.
Rev. Cobb is an exhibiting member of the
Buffalo Society of Artists, as well as a member
of the Buffalo Arts Council and the Buffalo &
Erie County Historical Society. He’s depicted
countless famous people, nationally and lo-
cally, throughout his career including: Oprah
Winfrey, Former Assemblyman the Honorable
Arthur O. Eve, Sr., Former Buffalo Mayor
James Griffin, Al Sharpton, and Former City
Councilman David Collins.
The New York City Ministerial Alliance of
the African Methodist Episcopal Church com-
missioned Rev. Cobb to Paint the founder and
First Bishop of their church, Bishop Richard
Allen. Bishop Allen’s portrait is among the ar-
chives and permanent collection of The
Schomburg Center for Research in Black Cul-
ture of the New York Public Library in Harlem.
Rev. Cobb is a gifted man endowed with
many talents. As a fine artist, he’s drawn for
more than sixty years and painted for approxi-
mately fifty years using various mediums and
striving for perfection in realism. As a sub-
stitute teacher in the Buffalo Public School
System, he shares his talents and guidance
with the youth of our community.
Madam Speaker, it is with great pride that I
acknowledge the JROTC Memorial Day As-
sembly, former president William McKinley
and Reverend William C. Cobb, Jr. Rev.
Cobb’s devotion to the arts and our commu-
nity is an inspiration to us all. I also want to
commemorate the service members of the
United States military who have made the ulti-
mate sacrifice in defense of our nation.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E679
May 28, 2019
COLONEL JEFFREY SMITH
HON. GREG WALDEN
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 28, 2019
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I rise to
commend Colonel Jeffrey S. Smith, United
States Air Force, for his outstanding devotion
and selfless service to the United States of
America. Colonel Smith will retire on June 01,
2019, from his present assignment as the
Commander of the 173rd Fighter Wing at
Kingsley Field in Klamath Falls, Oregon.
Colonel Smith entered the United States Air
Force Academy in 1991 and became a proud
graduate in 1995. His first mission took him
halfway around the world to Kadena Air Base
in Japan, and then Elmendorf Air Force Base
in Alaska. During his time in Japan and Alas-
ka, Colonel Smith engaged in Operations
Southern and Northern Watch in Iraq and kept
the skies safe in the aftermath of regional con-
flicts. In 2002, after Colonel Smith attended
United States Air Force Weapons School at
Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, he was de-
ployed to Incirlik Air Base in Turkey to help
the United States prepare for a pivotal mission
to root out terror from this world: Operation
Iraqi Freedom. In 2003, he executed the mis-
sion to equip the next generation of fighter pi-
lots with the skills and knowledge needed to
defend our great nation in the skies. This mis-
sion brought Colonel Smith back to Nellis Air
Force Base, where he served as an F–15 in-
structor at the United States Air Force Weap-
ons School, as the 57th Wing Weapons Offi-
cer. In 2005, he made his way to what would
become his home, Klamath Falls, Oregon,
where he joined the 114th Fighter Squadron at
Kingsley Field as an F–15 Flight Instructor.
Colonel Smith wore many hats at Kingsley. He
served as Chief of Academics, Chief of Sylla-
bus Development, Chief of Scheduling, Func-
tional Check Flight Pilot, Assistant Director of
Operations, Chief of F–15 Student Training,
Director of Operations, 173rd Maintenance
Squadron Commander, 173rd Deputy Mainte-
nance Group Commander, and 173rd Mainte-
nance Group Commander. This proven sus-
tained superior performance, seasoned oper-
ational knowledge, and superb leadership
made him the best choice to serve as the
Commander of the 173rd Fighter Wing.
For the community in Klamath Falls, and
also the dedicated men and women at Kings-
ley Field, Colonel Smith is the epitome of
leadership, professionalism, and a supportive
mentor. He led with both valor and rigor.
Under his valued leadership, he directed over
1,050 personnel, from widely varying back-
grounds, to ensure that airmen at the base
strategically excelled as an elite fighting force.
As the only place in the country where pilots
still train on the F–15, Kingsley Field has be-
come an incubator for second-to-none
(unrivaled) fighter pilots.
For the people in Klamath Falls, Colonel
Smith’s influence stretches far beyond the ex-
pansive skies over Kingsley Field, ensuring
the larger community benefits from Kingsley
Field’s presence. Whether partnering with the
local university, providing job opportunities, or
staying engaged with the community, he al-
ways brought a ‘‘Klamath-first’’ mindset to his
work. He led the effort to extend the Depart-
ment of Defense’s lease in Klamath Falls
through the rest of this century. As one of the
largest employers in the region, Kingsley Field
remains a strong economic driver. We
partnered and hosted both Air Force Secretary
Heather Wilson and the Chairman of the
House Armed Services Committee MAC
THORNBERRY, the first time either an Air Force
Secretary or Armed Services Committee
Chairman has ever visited Kingsley Field.
Colonel Smith has positioned Kingsley Field
and Klamath Falls for a bright future.
For a man of his caliber, who demonstrated
superb leadership, dedication, and sacrifice
throughout his service to our great nation, it
seems no amount of recognition is sufficient to
say thank you.
Madam Speaker, it has been an honor to
know and work alongside him for many years.
On behalf of a grateful nation, I join my col-
leagues today and congratulate Colonel Smith
for a lifetime of service to his country. We
wish him, his wife, Lindsay, and their two chil-
dren: Luke, 11, Alex 9, only the best wishes
as he retires from the United States Air Force.

IN MEMORY OF THOMAS BRYTE
HUGHES
HON. JOE WILSON
OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 28, 2019
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam
Speaker, Thomas Bryte Hughes passed away
peacefully in Lake Tahoe on May 18, 2019,
surrounded by family.
A fourth generation Sacramentan, Tom was
born on February 20, 1937 to Ruth Bryte
Hughes and Gordon Stanley Hughes. Tom
was the younger brother of Gordon Bryte
Hughes (1935 to 2017).
After attending Sacramento High School
and graduating from Menlo School, Tom en-
listed in the United States Army, stationed pri-
marily in Nuremberg, Germany. He recalled
that time as instrumental to his formative
years. Upon returning to Sacramento, he at-
tended Sacramento City College, Sacramento
State, then met Martha Reese. They were
married in 1961.
Tom’s 50 year career in the automobile in-
dustry began with his love of cars, and was in-
fluenced by his dear friends and business
partners Rusty and Roy Jacobes.
Tom developed an early love of Lake Tahoe
from trips with family and friends. He loved to
share stories of his hijinks both on and off the
lake, where he spent countless hours enjoying
his boats, ‘Splash’, ‘Tomsfoolery’, ‘ML Crisis’
and ‘Senior Crisis’. His family and friends were
often encouraged to ‘‘say goodnight to the
lake’’ with him at the end of an evening.
Tom was a Life Member of the Sutter Club,
where he loved nothing more than his domino
game over, lunch with friends, which he con-
tinued until the last week of his life. He also
belonged to The Pioneers, Royal Order of
Raccoons, The Grandfathers, Tahoe Yacht
Club, and The West Shore Club.
Tom is survived by his wife of almost 58
years Martha (Reese), his children Jennifer
Dowley (Doug Longyear), Howard Hughes
(Katy) and Meredith Lyons (Carter). He was
fondly known as ‘‘Grumpy’’ to his seven
grandchildren: Meg and Tommy Dowley;
Reese and Stephen Hughes; and Elizabeth,
Katie and Molly Lyons.
Tom loved cars and boats, he loved Lake
Tahoe, he loved his friends, and most of all,
he loved his family.
A celebration of Tom’s life will take place on
Wednesday, June 5th at 11:00 a.m. at The
Sutter Club. In lieu of flowers, please send do-
nations to The Shriners Hospital for Children
in Sacramento or the North Lake Tahoe His-
torical Society.

cial future for themselves and their families.
In today’s economy, far too many Ameri-
cans do not have adequate access to tradi-
tional retirement savings vehicles such as an
employer-sponsored 401(k) plans and pen-
sions.
In fact, as of 2016, only 30 percent of Amer-
ican households had access to a defined-ben-
efit plan and only 52 percent participated in a
defined-contribution plan.
These statistics are even starker for minority
families.
According to recent studies, while African-
Americans participating in employer-based re-
tirement plans were on par with White fami-
lies, participation rates have dropped to 41
percent in 2013, compared to 65 percent for
White families.
This bill would expand access to employer-
sponsored retirement savings plans for all
Americans and incentivize increased contribu-
tions to employee retirement accounts by em-
ployers.
It would also provide a tax credit for small
businesses to defray the costs of providing
their employees certain 401(k) retirement op-
tions that include automatic enrollment, which
has proven to increase employee participation
and result in higher retirement savings.
I urge my colleagues to support this impor-
tant legislation.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E680 May 28, 2019
Mr. Branch started his federal service in
1978 at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard as a
Contracting Intern with the Naval Regional
Procurement Office before transitioning to
Naval Air Systems (NAVAIR) Command as a
Contract Specialist in 1980. While serving at
NAVAIR, he supported HARM, HARPOON, T–
45 and F–14 Weapon Systems. From 1986 to
1993, Mr. Branch served as Branch Head and
Deputy Division Director for Sea Combat Sys-
tems, Undersea Weapons and Shipbuilding at
Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA).
In 1993, he became a member of the SES
as the Director, Shipbuilding Contracts Divi-
sion, at NAVSEA. He went on to serve as Ex-
ecutive Director, Acquisition and Business
Management for the Navy, responsible for pol-
icy and oversight of contract operations
throughout the entire Department. While in this
position, he also served as Project Executive
Officer, Acquisition Related Business Systems.
In this role, he was responsible for the formu-
lation and execution of a multi-year effort
transforming the Navy from a paper-based to
an electronic acquisition system.
From 1999 to 2006, Mr. Branch spent time
in the private sector where he specialized in
acquisition and project management education
as well as training and consulting for the fed-
eral workforce and its associated contractors.
He also served as the Chief Procurement Offi-
cer for the Government of the District of Co-
lumbia as the agency head responsible for
procurement operations, policy, and for formu-
lating legislative proposals for local and Con-
gressional consideration.
In 2006, Mr. Branch became the first civilian
Director of Contracts at the Naval Sea Sys-
tems Command where he led one of the larg-
est and most complex procurement organiza-
tions in the Federal government for two years.
As the senior civilian for contracting at
NAVSEA, Mr. Branch was responsible for the
contractual oversight of the Nation’s most
complex shipbuilding and weapons systems
procurement programs. His duties involved the
obligation and expenditure of approximately
$25 billion annually.
Elliott Branch will finish his career after
spending the past 10 years as Deputy Assist-
ant Secretary of the Navy, Acquisition and
Procurement in the Office of the Assistant
Secretary of the Navy, Research, Develop-
ment and Acquisition. He has served as the
senior career civilian responsible for acquisi-
tion and contracting policy that governs the
operation of the Navy’s world-wide, multibil-
lion-dollar acquisition system. Mr. Branch was
the principal civilian advisor to the Navy Acqui-
sition Executive for acquisition and procure-
ment matters, serving as the Department of
the Navy’s Competition Advocate General and
is the leader of the Navy’s contracting, pur-
chasing, and government property commu-
nities.
I am proud to represent Mr. Branch in Con-
gress, and I thank him and his family for his
honorable service to our nation with the United
States Navy. Madam Speaker, I ask my col-
leagues to join me in wishing Mr. Branch fair
winds and following seas as he concludes a
distinguished career of public service.
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF COACH OTIS WASHINGTON
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND
OF LOUISIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 28, 2019
Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor the life and legacy of a great man who
exemplified the true meaning of being a trail-
blazer, Coach Otis Washington. From St. Au-
gustine High School, to Louisiana State Uni-
versity (LSU), to Southern University, Coach
Washington positively touched the lives of so
many young men. Through the game of foot-
ball, he taught valuable lessons about the im-
portance of leadership, perseverance, and
teamwork.
Coach Washington was a giant whose ca-
reer transcended wins, losses, first downs,
and touchdowns. A man who dedicated his life
to making others better, he also broke down
barriers to make one of our most venerated in-
stitutions better. As the first African-American
coach hired at LSU, he paved the way for all
of those who have since followed in his foot-
steps and reached coaching heights once un-
known and unseen. In his earlier days, Coach
Washington played a pivotal role for St. Au-
gustine High School when the integration of
the Louisiana High School Athletic Association
was in its nascent stages. Dunng his time
there he amassed a remarkable 113–17
record despite pervasive racial tension.
As we look back on his storied life, his pro-
found commitment to excellence on every
level was clear and his on-field success was
unmatched. Today I offer my deepest condo-
lences to his family during this difficult time as
they cope with the pain of losing someone so
dear to so many people.
The state of Louisiana is forever indebted to
Coach Washington for all he did for the com-
munity. Moving forward, it is now the responsi-
bility of all of us he impacted to passionately
carry on his legacy of greatness, selflessness,
and leadership.
Madam Speaker, I celebrate the life and
legacy of Coach Otis Washington.

RECOGNIZING WORLD WAR II
VETERAN FELIX J. LISOVICH
HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 28, 2019
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize Felix J. Lisovich, a
World War II veteran from Westmoreland
County, Pennsylvania.
In 1943, three weeks after graduating from
Charleroi High School, Mr. Lisovich enlisted as
a Surgical Technician in the United States
Army. After completing his training, Mr.
Lisovich deployed to the Pacific Theater from
March 1994 to January 1946, where he par-
ticipated in amphibious operations to liberate
the Philippines and he encountered kamikaze
attacks from Japanese fighter planes
In 1945, Mr. Lisovich fought in the Battle of
Luzon with the 172nd Infantry Regiment, 43rd
Infantry Division. During the battle, he en-
gaged the enemy under intense fire and aided
casualty evacuations while tasked with cap-
turing a hill overlooking Rosario-Damortis
Road. Mr. Lisovich was wounded by grenade
shrapnel while aiding a fallen soldier and sur-
vived multiple banzai attacks.
For his service and his actions in World War
II, Mr. Lisovich was awarded the Combat Med-
ical Badge, Bronze Star, Good Conduct
Medal, Purple Heart Medal, World War II Vic-
tory Medal, Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal
with two bronze stars and one arrow, Army of
Occupation Medal, and the Philippine Libera-
tion Medal with one bronze star.
Madam Speaker, Mr. Lisovich represents
the very best of southwestern Pennsylvania.
Please join me in recognizing Felix J. Lisovich
for his service, courage, and sacrifice.

JENNY FORREST
HON. GREG WALDEN
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, May 28, 2019
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize and congratulate Jenny Forrest,
who will be attending Columbia University in
New York beginning this August to earn her
Master of Business Administration. Jenny has
been an invaluable member of Team Walden
for more than three years.
Starting as an intern in my Washington,
D.C. office, Jenny rose to staff assistant, for a
moment, before rapidly rising to the role of
scheduler, all without skipping a beat, even as
she learned that she would soon be sched-
uling for a committee chairman.
Anyone who is familiar with the inner work-
ings of Capitol Hill—whether you’re a member
of Congress, a staffer, reporter, or advocate—
knows that the title ‘‘scheduler’’ simply does
not capture the sheer importance and scope
of the role.
Schedulers are the gatekeepers of time, a
precious and finite resource on the Hill for any
Congressional office, but especially for Team
Walden and especially for the Energy and
Commerce Committee. Schedulers are con-
stantly asked to ‘‘hold,’’ ‘‘make,’’ and ‘‘find’’
time for people with competing interests and
either ignorance or disregard for the fragile
house of cards that is a congressional cal-
endar.
One would expect and understand sched-
ulers to be short-tempered, overwhelmed, and
perhaps even difficult to work with; but anyone
who had the pleasure of interacting with Jenny
knows nothing could be further from the truth.
If you walked into 2185 Rayburn House Of-
fice Building for the last couple of years, you
were always treated warmly with a smile from
Jenny. She was the face of the office at the
front desk, and thankfully so.
If you ever reached out to Jenny to request
time for a meeting, an interview, or a speech,
you were always treated with fairness, hon-
esty, and a kind directness. If there was no
time to be made, held, or found, there would
be no mistake about it if you were talking to
Jenny.
And if you were an Oregonian visiting for
business or pleasure—especially from Or-
egon’s Second District—Jenny went out of her
way to make sure you felt at home on the Hill
and was ready, at the drop of a hat, to be
your tour guide, restaurant recommender, or
trip advisor in the nation’s capital. Jenny re-
spected and understood well that she, along

with our entire team, works first and foremost
for the people of the Second District.
Most importantly, Jenny was a team player.
Anyone on Team Walden will tell you that if
you needed a hand with anything—a meeting
memo, CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, or folded
American flag—Jenny was there to jump in,
even if it had nothing to do with the schedule.
She patiently coordinated our intern program,
facilitated thousand-person town hall meet-
ings, and wrote excellent letters of support for
grants that brought needed resources to Or-
egon’s communities.
Jenny will be missed but will always be a
part of Team Walden. My colleagues, please
join me in thanking Jenny Forrest for her serv-
ice to this House and to the people of Or-
egon’s Second Congressional District. We
wish her the best at Columbia University, and
know that her future will be a bright one.
