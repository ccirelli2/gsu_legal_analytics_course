PAST TIME TO PASS USMCA
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, it is
time. Actually, it is past time. It is
past time for Congress to pass the
United States-Mexico-Canada Agree-
ment.
Today, I am pleased to join with my
colleague and friend, Senator STEVE
DAINES, to draw attention to the
USMCA’s importance to Montana.
President Trump and his trade nego-
tiators have done a great job negoti-
ating this trade deal. USMCA will se-
cure open access to markets in Mexico
and Canada, markets critical to Mon-
tana farmers, ranchers, manufacturers,
and businesses.
USMCA will bring over $68 billion in
new economic growth. USMCA will cre-
ate 176,000 new American jobs. USMCA
helps family farmers and ranchers,
which is why 1,000 ag groups from
across the country have endorsed it.
USMCA increases agricultural exports
by $2 billion a year. USMCA supports
American workers.
Speaker, USMCA is a win for Mon-
tana and America. But here we are, 355
days, almost a full year, since Presi-
dent Trump signed USMCA, and the
deal has gone nowhere in the House.
So, what is the holdup? The Speaker
has stalled since the deal was an-
nounced. She objected to it. Those ob-
jections were addressed, yet here we
are.
The Speaker says she is on a path to
yes on USMCA. A path to yes, however,
isn’t a yes. Farmers, ranchers, manu-
facturers, and business owners deserve
certainty, not just a path to yes and
more delays.
Unfortunately, just yesterday, Polit-
ico reported USMCA faces another
delay because of House leadership—an-
other delay. The House has 13 days left
this year, 13 days to get this deal done.
It is up to Congress to act.
Speaker, the needless delays must
end. The Trump administration has
done its job and negotiated an agree-
ment that works for Montana and our
country. It is time for Congress to do
its job.
I urge House leaders to give farmers,
ranchers, manufacturers, and business
owners the certainty they need. I urge
House leaders to move forward with
USMCA to create jobs, increase pay-
checks, and grow our economy.
Let’s consider USMCA. Let’s vote on
USMCA. Let’s ratify USMCA.
WE MUST GET USMCA RIGHT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes.
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to talk about the United States-Mex-
ico-Canada trade agreement and the
need for commonsense change to see
that our trade policies with Mexico and
Canada better reflect the current eco-
nomic conditions and the changes that
have occurred since the initial act was
put together over 25 years ago.
The administration’s trade policies,
though, currently with these tariff
wars, I believe, are not only hurting
consumers, but they are hurting our
farmers, ranchers, and dairymen and
-women. Let’s be clear about it: These
are hidden taxes that consumers pay
and that agriculture pays as well.
The United States-Mexico-Canada
Agreement, I think, would address
these concerns if we get it right.
As chairman of the Subcommittee on
Livestock and Foreign Agriculture,
opening new trade opportunities for ag-
riculture is one of my top priorities.
My home State of California is the
number one agricultural State in the
Nation, and nearly half of our ag prod-
ucts are exported abroad, over $20 bil-
lion a year.
I am a farmer, third generation. I un-
derstand the importance of our ability
to trade and have a fair and level play-
ing field.
Mexico and Canada combined is our
largest destination for these products.
Maintaining these markets is essential
to ensure prosperity for our farmers
and the viability of our ag economy.
We have had 25 years of a mostly suc-
cessful trading relationship with Can-
ada and Mexico since signing the North
American Free Trade Agreement in
1994, but a lot has changed. It has also
resulted in, let’s be frank, a loss of jobs
that has hurt American families here,
and we need to address that. This is an
opportunity to deal with the flaws that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9062 November 20, 2019
have existed in NAFTA for over 25
years.
Since 2002, Canada has been the
United States’ top agricultural export
market, and Mexico has either been
second or third. In 2018, we exported
$143 billion worth of agricultural prod-
ucts to the two countries combined.
The amount equaled over a quarter of
total U.S. ag exports. That is signifi-
cant.
The USMCA leaves in place, I think,
the key wins for agriculture estab-
lished under NAFTA. It updates key
provisions pertaining to important
issues like labor, technology, and the
environment. It also provides some new
access to Canada’s protected dairy
market, which I think is important.
The conversations between House
Democrats and the administration to
hammer out the remaining differences,
I think, have been constructive. I dis-
agree with some of the narratives that
this has been a delay. We want to get it
right. You must get good trade agree-
ments right. Our negotiators are mak-
ing good progress, including efforts to
ensure that enforcement to the agree-
ment is done.
But enforcement of labor standards
continues to remain a concern. This is
important. Labor in America doesn’t
want the same impacts that took place
under NAFTA, so enforcement of the
provisions is critical.
USMCA’s labor chapter does reflect a
strengthening of standards, including
freedom of association and the right to
organize in Mexico. We have had nu-
merous delegations meet with our
counterparts in Mexico. This spring,
Mexico passed landmark labor legisla-
tion laying the legal framework for
compliance with the United States-
Mexico-Canada labor chapter. Now we
must ensure that those labor standards
are enforced. That is the critical area
today.
House Democrats are working in
good faith with the administration to
put in place assurances that these
standards are enforced over the long
term.
The same goes for enforcement of en-
vironmental and biomedical standards.
Commitments need to be made, and
they have to be enforceable to make
this a successful agreement.
If these issues are addressed, the
USMCA would stabilize some trade
policies that are otherwise unpredict-
able with this administration, includ-
ing serious concerns that President
Trump may, as he said, kill NAFTA
and reject the deal if we don’t pass
this. We want to get it done ASAP for
sure, but we need to make sure it is
done right.
Sound trade policy should not be a
partisan issue. I will continue to make
sure that we can vote on USMCA as
soon as possible. Once again, though,
we have to have the assurances. I ex-
pect strong passage of an agreement if
we can get those assurances, but there
must be a way to address this so that
we will get to ‘‘yes.’’
Then we can turn our attention to
other trade matters. An agreement
with China, obviously, is very impor-
tant and in Europe with the European
Union.
Let me say, finally, good trade agree-
ments, I think, mean good-paying jobs.
Let me repeat that. Good trade agree-
ments mean good-paying jobs for all
Americans. That is obviously what we
want to do for our entire economy.
f
RECOGNIZING AMERICAN
EDUCATION WEEK
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize
American Education Week.
Every year, this week underscores
the importance of access to quality
education. It honors the teachers, in-
structors, and educational mentors
who make a difference in the lives of
our Nation’s learners.
Working to ensure access to high-
quality and affordable education for all
students is of utmost importance. The
American education system should be
as diverse as our Nation’s students, in-
cluding learners of all ages, of all so-
cioeconomic backgrounds, and from
rural America, urban America, and ev-
erywhere in between. That includes
students who choose to pursue a tradi-
tional 4-year college degree as well as
those who choose to attend a trade
school or an apprenticeship program.
As co-chair of the bipartisan Career
and Technical Education Caucus, I
have been pleased to introduce a num-
ber of career and technical education
bills, alongside my fellow co-chair,
Congressman JIM LANGEVIN, which aim
to restore rungs on the ladder of oppor-
tunity for every American.
Most recently, that includes H.R.
5092, the Counseling for Career Choice
Act. H.R. 5092 ensures students have
access to quality counseling resources
that can help them make more in-
formed decisions about their edu-
cational futures and professional ca-
reer choices. By better equipping these
students with the skills to succeed, we
are one step closer to closing our Na-
tion’s skills gap.
The skills gap is the result of a lack
of qualified students in STEM dis-
ciplines like nursing, energy, informa-
tion technology, cybersecurity, and
more. Career and technical education
is working to empower students by
equipping them with employable skills.
To directly address the workforce
shortage in cybersecurity, I was proud
to cosponsor H.R. 1592, the Cybersecu-
rity Skills Integration Act. This bill
would create a pilot program through
the Department of Education to award
grants to create or expand existing
postsecondary CTE programs in cyber-
security competencies.
Career and technical education has
support outside of the Education and
Labor Committee as well. I also co-
sponsored H.R. 898, the Skills Invest-
ment Act of 2019. H.R. 898 enhances
Coverdell Education Savings Accounts,
which are tax-advantaged savings ac-
counts for educational expenses. Amer-
ican workers can use the accounts to
pay for skills-based learning, career
training, and workforce development.
In addition, both workers and employ-
ers receive tax credits for contribu-
tions to these accounts.
Mr. Speaker, in addition to address-
ing the shortage of our skilled work-
force, we need to continue increasing
educational access for students who are
living with disabilities. The Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act en-
sures nearly 7 million infants, toddlers,
children, and youth with disabilities
have access to quality education.
Unfortunately, Congress has fallen
short on our commitment to these in-
dividuals, and support for students
with disabilities has remained under-
funded. That is why I was proud to sup-
port H.R. 1878, the IDEA Full Funding
Act, which would mandate gradual in-
creases in IDEA funding to reach the
full funding as promised by Congress
when IDEA was passed and to do that
by fiscal year 2029.
Lastly, there are many bipartisan
bills that support quality education for
American learners. I have always be-
lieved that we produce the best results
for students when we work across the
aisle. However, the partisan College Af-
fordability Act, which would reauthor-
ize the Higher Education Act, actually
contributes to crippling college costs
and widens our Nation’s skills gap.
It is my hope that we can offer real
solutions like the High-Quality Oppor-
tunities in Postsecondary Education
Act, or the HOPE Act, which provides
institutions with the tools they need to
help students prepare for successful ca-
reers and successful lives.
This is American Education Week.
Let’s remember that students deserve
better than a one-size-fits-all edu-
cational plan.

PASS USMCA BEFORE YEAR-END
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. ROUDA) for 5 minutes.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in support of resolving the out-
standing issues needed to pass the
United States-Mexico-Canada Agree-
ment, or USMCA, before the end of the
year.
More than 12 million American jobs,
including 1.8 million jobs in California,
depend on trade with Canada and Mex-
ico. We simply cannot afford to keep
the current rules in place if we are to
secure our economic future and create
better paying American jobs.
b 1015
Addressing contentious issues in a
trade deal are always difficult, but I
am optimistic that we can come to a
productive resolution if the adminis-
tration continues to engage with House
Democrats in good faith.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9063
November 20, 2019
USMCA represents an opportunity to
fix fundamental flaws in our trade pol-
icy, reverse the failings of NAFTA, es-
tablish strong, enforceable labor stand-
ards across North America, and pro-
mote growth in new sectors of each of
our economies. Let’s get it right this
time.
I thank Speaker PELOSI, Chairman
NEAL, and House Democratic leader-
ship for their commitment to working
families and for ensuring USMCA re-
flects our core values, and I ask for a
vote on USMCA as soon as possible.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF
MS. JENNIFER T. GRAHAM
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Ms. Jen-
nifer T. Graham for being honored by
the Zonta Club of Savannah for her
work helping single mothers through-
out the Savannah area.
Ms. Graham galvanized a citywide ef-
fort that has significantly aided hun-
dreds of mothers in our community.
She founded Shelter From the Rain,
which assists low-income mothers by
providing food, job search assistance,
baby supplies, mentorship, and more.
Since Ms. Graham founded the organi-
zation in 2010, Shelter From the Rain
has helped over 300 single mothers.
Her background in marketing and
outreach, which includes earning a
graduate degree in marketing and
doing communications for a number of
local healthcare companies has helped
her maximize the number of mothers
her organization reaches.
Thank you, Ms. Graham, for your
work making our community a better
place to live, and thank you to the
Zonta Club for recognizing the impor-
tant work she is doing. Keep up the
great work.
NATIONAL HEALTHY SKIN MONTH
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the month
of November as National Healthy Skin
Month.
Your skin is your body’s largest
organ, so it is critical to take care of
it. Unfortunately, skin cancer affects
around 20 percent of the population.
This month, I encourage everyone to
think about ways to keep your skin
healthy during your daily activities.
For example, wearing sunscreen, mois-
turizing, washing your face, and pro-
tecting against blisters are all meas-
ures one can take to stay healthy.
Additionally, I hope everyone will
consider visiting a dermatologist this
month for a skin evaluation.
Thank you to the American Academy
of Dermatology as well as dermatolo-
gists around the country for your work
to protect this vital part of our health.
RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF MS. MEG HEAP
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Ms. Meg
Heap, who was recently honored by the
Zonta Club of Savannah for her work
to reduce domestic violence against
women.
Serving as the district attorney for
the Savannah area since 2013, she has
spearheaded a number of programs in
coastal Georgia to create greater
equality for women. She created an
early notification prosecutor position
for domestic violence and an early no-
tification process for the Victim Wit-
ness Program. Additionally, she cre-
ated a one-stop Chatham County Fam-
ily Justice Center.
In 2019, the District Attorney Asso-
ciation of Georgia selected her as the
District Attorney of the Year.
From Savannah originally, Ms. Heap
can be an inspiration to all of us about
giving back to your community.
Thank you, Ms. Heap, for all of your
work to make Savannah a better place
to live, and thank you to the Zonta
Club of Savannah for recognizing her
achievements.
HAPPY 95TH BIRTHDAY TO MR. HOWARD YOUNG
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Mr. How-
ard Young, who turns 95 years young
on November 25. He has lived in the Sa-
vannah area for over 30 years, and, dur-
ing this time, he has spent countless
hours helping others around the com-
munity.
After retiring in his 50s, he began to
spend each day with a different organi-
zation volunteering. On Mondays he
works with the Veterans Administra-
tion Clinic, on Tuesdays he works with
senior citizens.
And the list doesn’t stop at Friday. A
World War II Navy veteran, he works
with veterans to help them get medical
benefits on Saturdays and serves at the
Isle of Hope Methodist Church on Sun-
days.
I am proud to have a constituent like
Mr. Young in the First Congressional
District of Georgia. It is easy to be in-
spired by his work making the world a
better place to live.
As he says: ‘‘Each passing day is gone
forever, so I want to spend as much of
each day as possible helping someone
who can’t help himself.’’
Happy birthday, Mr. Young.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF COACH MARVIN KEELEN
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Louisiana (Mr. RICHMOND) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, today
I rise with a heavy heart to acknowl-
edge the life and legacy of Coach
Marvin Keelen. Coach Keelen coached
at Goretti Playground in New Orleans,
Louisiana.
I met Coach Marvin probably when I
was about 13 years old; and he started
me out as a bookkeeper at the play-
ground keeping score. Then I went on
to be an umpire; then I went on to be
a coach.
Coach Marvin passed away this week-
end, but over his 34 years of coaching
at Goretti Playground, he has touched
the lives of so many young men. We
have a Capitol Police officer here that
Coach Marvin coached. We have myself
and countless others that his direction,
his mentorship provided a real pathway
for a lot of our young men.
The other thing I would say about
Coach Marvin is his family followed in
his footsteps. Just two weekends ago,
his younger son, Nick, won his first
city championship. His other son,
Marvin, won a couple of city champion-
ships, and Coach Marvin won about
seven.
But it wasn’t just about competing.
It was taking our young kids and mak-
ing sure that they understood their po-
tential to be whatever they wanted to
be, that they could be champions if
they wanted to be, that they could ac-
tually be U.S. Congressmen.
So I just want to extend my condo-
lences to his wife Jennifer Keelen; his
daughter Nikki; his son, Nick; and his
other son, Marvin, to let them know
that their father has heard those
words: ‘‘Well done, my good and faith-
ful servant.’’
CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF JUDGE
ANGELIQUE ‘‘ANGIE’’ REED
Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise
to celebrate the life and legacy of
Judge Angelique ‘‘Angie’’ Reed, who
passed in the city of New Orleans.
Judge Reed was the quintessential
judge. She was fair, but she was firm.
She expected the best out of lawyers in
front of her, and she demanded nothing
less.
She was a proud member of Alpha
Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated,
and, in honor of her, I am wearing my
pink tie today. She was also a faithful
member of Jack and Jill, that provides
mentorship to children and commu-
nities all across the country, and she
was a faithful member of the New Orle-
ans Chapter of The Links.
Let me just say that her membership
in all of these organizations really
highlighted her love for New Orleans.
On the national level, she was a
member of the Judicial Council of the
National Bar Association, even co-
chairing the event in New Orleans.
I first met Judge Angie Reed when
she was just a young lawyer in the City
Attorney’s Office and I was a law clerk
trying to find my way around. She
took me under her wing and taught me
life lessons that I would never forget
about the practice of law: that it was
not about trying to make money; it
was not about you, but it was about
your client; it was about making a dif-
ference; it was about righting a wrong.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in his
speech, ‘‘Give Us the Ballot,’’ pro-
claimed that, if you give us the ballot
in the South, we will elect judges and
put judges on the bench that will love
mercy and do justice. Judge Angelique
Reed did just that, and she did it better
than anyone else.
She leaves behind her daughter,
Giana Warren.

she will be sorely missed.
She also will hear those words:
‘‘Judge Reed, well done, my good and
faithful servant.’’

SUPPORT THE K–9 HERO ACT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. WRIGHT) for 5 minutes.
Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I am
proud to have introduced the K–9 Hero
Act last week.
Military and law enforcement K–9s
work in tandem with the brave men
and women who serve our great Nation.
Once these heroes retire from service,
the medical treatment they need is
often significant enough to create a fi-
nancial hardship for the individuals
who care for them.
The K–9 Hero Act creates a grant pro-
gram to assist nonprofits that take in
retired working dogs or provide finan-
cial assistance to the owners of retired
working dogs. These grants will cover
medical costs, such as veterinarian vis-
its, medical procedures, diagnostic
tests, and medications, which tend to
average around $3,000 per year per dog.
As most know, just a few weeks ago,
a K–9 played a crucial role in the cap-
ture and ultimate killing of ISIS leader
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. This K–9 took
off, racing down an underground tunnel
before cornering Baghdadi, leaving him
nowhere to run. It is stories like these
that inspired me to introduce the K–9
Hero Act.
These dogs assist our Federal Gov-
ernment in ways that no man or ma-
chine could, and it is unacceptable to
me for them to live with inadequate
medical care—or even be euthanized, in
some cases—after sacrificing so much
for our country.
This bill helps ensure these heroes
are well taken care of during retire-
ment and that their need for medical
care never prevents them from finding
a loving forever home. My K–9-loving
colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I
believe, should support this legislation.
STOP THE PRACTICE OF TELEABORTION
Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to express my outrage over the
practice of teleabortion. This practice,
which gets its name from practitioners
conducting abortions over the phone or
computer, occurs when chemical abor-
tions are induced with no healthcare
provider present.
This practice sounds simple, except
the woman taking the drugs isn’t in a
medical facility, no certified medical
personnel are present, and if the drugs
don’t work as planned and the baby is
not stillborn, it may still end up in a
dumpster and the mother may end up
in an emergency room.
The obvious danger is why I filed
H.R. 4935, the Teleabortion Prevention
Act. This legislation protects women’s
health by making it a Federal offense
for healthcare providers to perform a
chemical abortion without first phys-
ically examining the patient, being
present during the chemical abortion,
and scheduling a follow-up visit for the
patient.
Chemical abortions are induced using
a two-step abortion pill regimen that
can be taken up until the ninth week of
pregnancy. Given the serious risks, the
FDA has put regulations in place, but
pro-abortion groups are looking for
ways to get around the law.
If these FDA regulations are ever
lifted, chemical abortion drugs could
become available by prescription, ena-
bling a single healthcare provider to
mail chemical abortion pills to women
and young girls across the country, re-
gardless of State pro-life protections
and whether they have seen a doctor
and had an ultrasound performed. This
legislation ensures these much-needed
FDA regulations will not be lifted.
No doctor should feel comfortable
prescribing a life-ending pharma-
ceutical drug without physically being
there to administer it to the patient.
If the woman’s health argument is
really more than subterfuge that puts
dressing on a tragedy, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in passing H.R. 4935,
the Teleabortion Prevention Act.
NATIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR MONUMENT ACT
Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise be-
cause yesterday I had the privilege of
introducing the National Medal of
Honor Monument Act, with my fellow
Texan, Congressman MARC VEASEY.
Over the course of our history, over
3,500 United States servicemen and
-women have been honored with our
Nation’s highest military decoration,
the Medal of Honor.
The Medal of Honor is awarded to
U.S. servicemembers who have distin-
guished themselves with extraordinary
acts of valor. These men and women I
am referring to went above and beyond
the call of duty on the battlefield in
order to preserve our families and way
of life.
This legislation ensures that their
contribution and patriotism are never
forgotten. These heroic individuals de-
serve to be memorialized with a monu-
ment in our Nation’s Capitol, among
the other great Americans that have
helped shape our Nation.
In Texas, we celebrate patriotism,
American ideals, and our Nation’s he-
roes. Earlier this fall, the National
Medal of Honor Museum Foundation
chose my hometown of Arlington,
Texas, as the location for the new Na-
tional Medal of Honor Museum. This
legislation makes it official.
Congratulations to Mayor Williams
and the rest of Arlington’s leadership
for bringing it to the 6.8 million Dallas-
Ft. Worth residents and the over 14
million visitors Arlington welcomes
each year and, most importantly, the
1.8 million veterans and Active-Duty
military that call Texas home.

PRAYER
Rabbi Steven Abraham, Beth El Syn-

following prayer:
Our God and God of our ancestors, we
stand before You in this sacred Hall to
ask for Your blessings upon the Mem-
bers of this House, the leaders of our
country, and the citizens of this great
Nation.
May You bless our leaders with the
wisdom to follow Your teachings; to
speak up for those who cannot speak
for themselves; to protect the widow,
the orphan, and the stranger.
May You bless our leaders with com-
passion to open both their hearts and
their minds to places and ideas where
they are currently closed.
May You bless our leaders with the
courage to do what is hard, to do what
is unpopular, but to do what is right.

with the opening prayer. I would also
like to welcome his family to this
House that belongs to all Americans.
Rabbi Abraham has been the rabbi
for Beth El Synagogue since 2013, after
moving to Omaha to be the assistant
rabbi in 2011. He graduated from rab-
binical school at the Jewish Theo-
logical Seminary, where he also re-
ceived a masters of arts in Jewish edu-
cation. He is also an alumnus of the
University of Baltimore.
Since I came to Congress in 2017,
Rabbi Abraham has been a trusted
friend and adviser for both my staff
and me.
I call on all of us to heed the words
offered in prayer by the rabbi. We must
all humble ourselves to the wisdom of
the Almighty, and let us always try to
be a voice for the voiceless and serve
with compassion and courage.
We face many challenges ahead, but
with prayerfulness and good faith in
one another, I know we can rise above
the trials of today in search of a better
tomorrow, all for the sake of our coun-
try.
Thank you again, Rabbi Abraham,
for being a genuine leader and for being
with us today.

WORLD PANCREATIC CANCER DAY
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr.
Speaker, November 21 is recognized as
World Pancreatic Cancer Day, a time
to raise awareness and inspire action in
the fight against this devastating diag-
nosis which touches too many families.
It is the third leading cause of cancer
deaths in the United States, with a 5-
year survival rate of just 9 percent.
More than 1,000 new cases are diag-
nosed around the world every day, and
it is estimated that pancreatic cancer
will be responsible for 3,000 deaths in
New York State this year alone.
The Pancreatic Cancer Action Net-
work and its western New York affil-
iate have made it their goal to double
pancreatic cancer survival. As co-chair
of the House Cancer Caucus, I am
proud to advocate for robust funding
for cancer research to put goals like
this within reach.
Recently, researchers at Roswell
Park Comprehensive Cancer Center an-
nounced promising findings on treat-
ments aimed at overcoming pancreatic
cancer’s resistance to treatment, but
continued funding on projects like this
is critical to saving lives.
The need to increase pancreatic can-
cer survival rates is urgent, and it
must be America’s goal.
AMERICA APPRECIATES FARMERS
(Mr. KELLY of Mississippi asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and

Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam
Speaker, as we remember the first
Thanksgiving when settlers broke
bread with their Native American al-
lies and shared fruits of their harvest,
I rise today to thank our Nation’s
farmers.
As Thanksgiving approaches and we
prepare to enjoy the holiday meal with
our families, I would be remiss if I did
not take time to thank the Americans
whose labor allows us to put food on
our tables.
Along with our military, our farmers
are the hardest working, most skilled,
and patriotic citizens in our country.
They rise before dawn and work long
after dusk to ensure our Nation can
feed and clothe the world.
I urge this body to uphold its com-
mitment to our farmers by passing the
United States-Mexico-Canada trade
agreement and ensure American agri-
culture remains the strongest and most
competitive in the world.
I hope my colleagues will join me
today in giving thanks to America’s
farmers during this Thanksgiving sea-
son.
f
NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE
MONTH
(Mr. SCHRADER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. SCHRADER. Madam Speaker, I
rise to honor and recognize Native
American Heritage Month.
Oregon currently has nine federally
recognized Tribes, three of which I am
proud to represent here in Congress:
The Confederated Tribes of Grand
Ronde, the Confederated Tribes of
Siletz Indians, and the Confederated
Tribes of Warm Springs. I work closely
with these Tribal governments and
with Tribal members, and I am proud
to partner with them and support their
work.
Oregon’s Tribes do incredible work to
protect precious natural resources, to
save our salmon, to lift up Native
youth, to keep our communities safe,
and so much more.
I want to specifically thank Siletz
Chairwoman Dee Pigsley, Grand Ronde
Chairwoman Cheryle Kennedy, and
Warm Springs Chairman Raymond
Tsumpti for their leadership.
I also want to acknowledge that
Grand Ronde, Siletz, and Warm Springs
are confederations of Tribes that were
terminated in 1954 in an insidious act
that ended the government’s recogni-
tion of Tribal sovereignty and dis-
missed the government’s trust respon-
sibility in western Oregon and across
the country. Their restoration is only
beginning.
Because of this, Congress must do
more to ensure that we are honoring
our commitments to Tribes and taking
seriously our trust responsibility.

VETERANS HISTORY PROJECT
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.
Madam Speaker, I am grateful that our
office is participating in the Veterans
History Project. This project is an on-
going effort by the Library of Congress
to collect and preserve personal ac-
counts by American military veterans
and families.
I have had the opportunity to meet
with local veterans in Aiken and the
Midlands to encourage participation.
The narratives recorded through this
project keep history alive for future
generations.
Coordinating the project is Purple
Heart recipient Jeffrey Crosby. Across
America, citizens can participate at
website loc.gov/vets.
As a veteran, as the son of a Flying
Tiger with service in India and China,
and as the father of four sons who have
served overseas in the Army National
Guard and the Navy, I am thankful for
the project.
Congratulations, President Donald
Trump, with news today that his poli-
cies of creating jobs have led to South
Carolina’s lowest unemployment level
in history at 2.6 percent—opportunities
for all according to WVOC.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.

THE HOUSE IS CONTINUING THE
WORK OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
(Mr. CÁRDENAS asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. CÁRDENAS. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to highlight the great work
of the House of Representatives. For
the last 10 months in the 116th Con-
gress, the House of Representatives has
passed 18 healthcare bills, 5 gun safety
bills, 81 education bills, 47 national se-
curity and defense bills, 45 environ-
mental bills, 36 immigration bills, 40
infrastructure and transportation bills,
and much more.
My point, Madam Speaker, is that we
are continuing the work of the Amer-
ican people. We never lost sight of our
promise and commitment to the people
of this great country.
We are constantly fighting back the
White House’s attempt to take away
healthcare from millions of Americans,
and we are working to lower prescrip-
tion drug costs.
We will continue supporting our mili-
tary and ensure that they have all the
resources that they need to keep Amer-
icans safe.
We will not allow this President to
keep us from fulfilling our duty to
make our economy stronger, our

SAVING RURAL HOSPITALS
(Mr. GREEN of Tennessee asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam
Speaker, instead of this laser focus on
impeachment, we should be doing the
people’s work and passing a bill to help
many Americans across this country
who live in rural areas. My bipartisan
Rural Health Care Access Act, H.R.
2990, would do just that.
Between January 1, 2010, and March
19, 2019, 102 rural hospitals closed in
America. We are facing a crisis for
rural America. These closures are in-
creasing almost every year.
While so many of our senior citizens
must utilize Medicare, Medicare is not
reimbursing all hospitals in rural areas
at a sustainable rate. We need to des-
ignate all our rural hospitals as Crit-
ical Access Hospitals.
Currently, this designation does not
apply to those hospitals in rural areas
that are slightly less than 35 miles
from another hospital. My bill would
get rid of this distance requirement,
while maintaining all other require-
ments. It would help stave off the rapid
decline of healthcare and protect vital
jobs in rural communities.
I urge the Speaker to give my bill a
chance.
f
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR ALL
(Ms. CLARKE of New York asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend her remarks.)
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam
Speaker, pursuing the American Dream
has become a daunting task for mil-
lions of Americans in need of a place
they can call home. We must address
affordable housing, as we are in the
midst of an acute crisis, and it is
sweeping across America.
From my district in Brooklyn, New
York, to Portland, Oregon, families
coast to coast are getting priced out of
their communities and driven into pov-
erty and homelessness. My newly in-
troduced bill, the Affordable Housing
and Area Median Income Fairness Act,
will attack this crisis head-on.
My bill addresses the clearly flawed
model that has been used to calculate
area median incomes, which is the
basis on which rental rates are set.
This outdated model made it harder for
our families to afford having a roof
over their heads, meanwhile, lining the
pockets of big developers.
The Federal Government cannot—
must not—continue to be complicit in
this travesty.
As cities grow and communities
evolve, the ability to afford having a
roof over one’s head should not be rel-
egated only to those whose incomes af-
ford them luxury.
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to join me in this crusade for
human dignity: affordable housing for
all Americans, access to affordable
housing.
f
FARMER OF THE YEAR STEVE
KELLEY
(Mr. COMER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I
would like to congratulate Mr. Steve
Kelley of Carlisle County, Kentucky,
for being named the 2019 Kentucky
Farm Bureau Farmer of the Year.
It is with great pride that I can say
this is the fourth year in a row that a
farmer in Kentucky’s First Congres-
sional District has been recognized as
Kentucky Farmer of the Year.
After receiving his bachelors and
masters degrees in agriculture from
Murray State University, Steve em-
barked on a decades-long career farm-
ing over 2,500 acres in Carlisle County.
His solar farm, as well as his grain,
livestock, and timber operations, sets
Steve apart and highlights the ambi-
tious future he sees for agriculture in
the Commonwealth. He believes that it
is his purpose to ‘‘leave his farmland in
better condition than when he received
it.’’
I am honored to congratulate the 2019
Kentucky Farmer of the Year, Mr.
Steve Kelley, and his family on his un-
wavering work ethic, dedication to the
Carlisle County Farm Bureau, and out-
standing role in the agriculture com-
munity.

FOR THE PEOPLE
(Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker,
don’t let anybody tell you that all we
do here in the House of Representatives
is investigate the White House. We
have passed 275-plus bipartisan bills for
the good of the people.
For hardworking families, we have
passed legislation to increase wages
and protect pensions.
For American women, we have passed
legislation to promote personal secu-
rity and ensure equal pay for equal
work.
For American communities, we have
passed legislation to improve public
safety by strengthening background
checks.
And for our American veterans, we
have passed legislation to improve
transition assistance and access to
mental healthcare.
Rather than govern, Senate Repub-
licans have chosen to play politics.
This Congress, they have refused to
consider more than 275 House-passed
bipartisan bills. Those are bills that
have Republican support sitting on the
desk of the Senate leader not being
passed.
Madam Speaker, I remind Senate Re-
publicans: Do your job. Let’s govern
wisely and get these bills passed.

ADOPTION MONTH
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize November as National Adoption
Month.
This month we celebrate the life-
changing act of adoption that has
touched the lives of so many in our
country. American families nationwide
open their homes and their hearts to
children in search of a stable environ-
ment and a forever home.
Despite the many parents that adopt,
there are still so many children in the
foster care system in search of a place
to call home. In 2018, almost half a mil-
lion children and teenage youth were
in U.S. foster care. As a country we
must always strive to help the most
vulnerable citizens among us. All chil-
dren in America deserve a permanent
family that can provide them with the
love, support, and encouragement need-
ed to reach their full potential in life.
During this important awareness
month, we recognize the unconditional
love adoptive parents provide to their
children, and we hope that all children
will soon be welcomed into a loving
family.

FIRE FIRST RESPONDERS
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-

Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, at around 3
a.m. on Sunday, September 22, a fire
broke out and punctured the calm of an
assisted living facility in my commu-
nity, Pennsylvania Seven, at Heather
Glen Senior Living in Allentown, Penn-
sylvania.
Firefighters answered the call, rush-
ing into the building as flames gained
force and tore through the roof. With
extraordinary skill, they got to work
saving the 82 elderly residents as the
fire raged, carrying these men and
women on their shoulders out of win-
dows on to ladders. They brought all of
the residents, as well as the five staff
members working that night, to safety
swiftly, while containing and ulti-
mately defeating the fire.
In total, 45 agencies across four coun-
ties participated in this operation,
coming together as a single unit in
complete dedication to the mission at
hand. In their example we see the best
of the Greater Lehigh Valley and of our
Nation.

RECOGNIZING NATIVE AMERICAN
HISTORY MONTH
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Native American
History Month and the contributions of
Native Americans in my congressional
district in central Washington.
With 29 Federally recognized tribes
across the State, Washingtonians live
alongside Native Americans who serve
our communities through entrepre-
neurship, military service, and sharing
their rich and storied cultural history.
They are our friends, family, neigh-
bors, and coworkers.
While we recognize that one month
out of the year to remember the histor-
ical and cultural contributions of our
Native friends, we must support them
as they face a crisis that has affected
Native women for decades. That crisis
is of missing and murdered indigenous
women.
In Washington, Native Americans
make up about 2 percent of the popu-
lation, but indigenous women account
for 7 percent of the State’s reported
missing women. This includes 31 open
cases on or near the Yakama Nation
Reservation.
During Native American History
Month, I challenge this body to honor
the heritage of our Native friends by
taking up legislation that will help en-
sure that missing and murdered loved
ones are not part of the history of an-
other generation of Native women.

(Mr. GREEN of Texas asked and was

Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-

I rise today for a very special pur-
pose. I rise because this House on Mon-
day passed H.R. 3702, the Reforming
Disaster Recovery Act of 2019.
I rise today, because in thanking peo-
ple on Tuesday, I neglected to thank
one person who was extremely impor-
tant in the passage of this legislation.
The majority leader Mr. HOYER not
only worked to help us bring the legis-
lation to the floor, Mr. HOYER also im-
proved the legislation. When it left our
committee, it was a good bill. It had
the unanimous consent of the com-
mittee.
Some things bear repeating. One hun-
dred percent of the people on the Fi-
nancial Services Committee supported
this legislation.
Mr. HOYER helped us by infusing it
with some additional language that
deals with resiliency that will help us
to rebuild better and stronger after
there has been a disaster.
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. HOYER
for his leadership. Especially he is
thanked for making a good bill a much
better bill.

HIGHLIGHTING THE 7-YEAR ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE DISAPPEAR-
ANCE OF KHALIL MAATOUK
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to highlight the 7-year anniver-
sary of Christian human rights lawyer
Khalil Maatouk’s unconscionable dis-
appearance at the hands of Syrian dic-
tator Bashar al-Assad.
The regime abducted Maatouk be-
cause he had been relentlessly defend-
ing Syrian democratic activists. He
was last seen on October 2 of 2012.
Khalil Maatouk’s ordeal serves as a
stark reminder of the Assad regime’s
barbaric assault on religious and Chris-
tian heritage, blatantly violating
international humanitarian law. Ac-
cording to a September report from the
Syrian Network for Human Rights, the
regime is responsible for targeting 61
percent of churches throughout the
country.
The United States demands the im-
mediate release of Khalil Maatouk, and
I urge the administration to prioritize
this case. We must stand up for those
who fight for freedom, especially free-
dom of religion.

RECOGNIZING THE TAINOS AND
CARIBS DURING NATIVE AMER-
ICAN HERITAGE MONTH
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker,
November is Native American Heritage
Month, and I would like to share with
you a story, one unknown to most
Americans, but one that Virgin Island-
ers learn at a young age. It is the Car-
ibbean story of Europe’s drive for con-
quest and the resistance of the Native
Americans of the Virgin Islands, the
Tainos and the Caribs.
In 1493, Columbus and his men landed
on Ayay, known now as Saint Croix in
the U.S. Virgin Islands. There they met
a group of Taino people who had been
taken captive by the Caribs. While en
route back to their ship with these cap-
tives, Columbus’ men encountered the
fierce Carib villagers, and the first re-
corded violent conflict between Euro-
peans and Native Americans of the
Western Hemisphere ensued, killing
one of Columbus’ men.
Men and women fought with bows
and canoes against gunpowder on ships.
It is our story of Native pride of resist-
ance, of remembering what is yours.
However, the Taino and Carib peoples
have left us with so much more. When
you use such words as barbecue, guava,
canoe, hurricane, potato, maze, savan-
nah, you are connecting with indige-
nous people who centuries ago jour-
neyed from South America to settle in
the archipelago that has given, and
continues to give, much to this coun-
try and the world.

A STEPPING STONE FOR PEACE IN
KASHMIR
(Mr. OLSON asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise
to share the facts and give an update
on what is happening in the Jammu
Kashmir region. Jammu Kashmir was
given special treatment in the Con-
stitution of 1947 in India. It was cre-
ated by the ‘‘Temporary Provisions
with Respect to the State of Jammu
Kashmir.’’ It is known as article 370.
It was supposed to be a stop-gap
measure because the government had
not been formed yet. For 70 straight
years, this temporary article has
forced citizens of Jammu Kashmir to
live under different laws than all other
Indians; different rules for citizenship,
property ownership.
Earlier this year, the Indian Par-
liament confirmed that article 370’s
temporary status should end. It ended.
It gave the people of Jammu Kashmir
the same rights as all Indians. It was a
landslide, 125-to-61 in the Rajya Sabha
and 370-to-70 in the Lok Sabha. This
action is solely about equality for all
Indians.
Hopefully, this can be a step toward
peace in Kashmir.

IN FAVOR OF THE AMERICAN
DREAM
(Mr. RIGGLEMAN asked and was

Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to speak in favor of the
American Dream; in favor of the bed-
rock of what has made America: cap-
italism.
Yesterday, while every cable news
channel was transfixed by the Intel-
ligence Committee, the Financial Serv-
ices Committee was discussing a bill
that strikes at the heart of American
capitalism.
H.R. 3848, the companion legislation
to Senator ELIZABETH WARREN’s Stop
Wall Street Looting Act, would add
regulatory costs and harm job creators.
It has a pithy title that is, unfortu-
nately, misleading in purpose. I prefer
to call it the stop entrepreneurship act.
This bill would curb private invest-
ments in Main Street companies, which
would kill jobs, stifle innovation, harm
consumers, and strike a major blow to
the hallmark of capitalism.

BRINGING ATTENTION TO HUNGER
AND HOMELESSNESS DURING
NATIONAL HUNGER AND HOME-

(Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given

Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, each
year during the week prior to Thanks-
giving, communities across the coun-
try come together to bring awareness
to the problems of hunger and home-
lessness.
Today, I want to recognize the Collin
County organizations that work to end
hunger and homelessness throughout
our community.
Today, there are 42 million Ameri-
cans facing hunger on any given night,
and more than 194,000 people will sleep
on the street.
While these numbers are sobering, we
are incredibly grateful for those in our
community who work to ease the suf-
fering of others, organizations such as
the Collin County Homeless Coalition,
the Family Promise of Collin County,
North Texas Food Bank, Minnie’s Food
Pantry, and Hope’s Door New Begin-
ning Center, Allen Community Out-
reach, and many, many others who
work year-round to take care of those
less fortunate.
Through these organizations, volun-
teers, businesses, and faith commu-
nities come together to provide neces-
sities like shelter and nutritious meals.
They go above and beyond to ensure
those in need have access to basic med-
ical care and hygiene products and
even provide training and placement
resources for those struggling with
homelessness.

PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF CONGRESS
SPENDING TAX DOLLARS ON A
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED IM-
PEACHMENT CHARADE
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, yes-
terday’s public impeachment hearings
produced some noteworthy facts. Rep-
resentative MIKE TURNER’s question of
Ambassador Volker took apart the
Democrats’ entire case. Volker con-
firmed that President Trump never
said that Ukraine must investigate the
Bidens in order to receive defense aid
from the United States.
Further, Representative ELISE
STEFANIK’s questioning of Tim Morri-
son showed there was no quid pro quo,
no bribery, no extortion, and no men-
tion of withholding aid in exchange for
investigating the Bidens.
Witnesses have repeatedly stated
that no quid pro quo, no bribery took
place. These facts, which indeed clear
our President, do not change. Mean-
while, President Trump continues to be
denied basic due process rights.
Democrat leadership continues to put
politics before the people obsessing
over impeachment and refusing to
work on policies that would actually
benefit the American people: ratifying
the USMCA, permanently extending
the 2017 tax cuts for families, and low-
ering the cost of prescription drugs.
The people are tired of this Congress
spending their tax dollars on a politi-
cally-motivated impeachment charade.

WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER TO
COMBAT CANCER
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, No-
vember is Lung Cancer Awareness
Month, an important time for us to
highlight the need for more research
and better community awareness on
this disease.
The statistics surrounding lung can-
cer are astounding. Approximately
541,000 Americans living today have
been diagnosed with lung cancer at
some point in their lives. While the
rate of new lung cancer cases over the
past 4 decades has dropped 36 percent
for men, it has risen 84 percent for
women.
That is why I am proud to cosponsor
H.R. 2222, the Women and Lung Cancer
Research and Preventive Services Act.
This bill would evaluate and identify
opportunities for more research, pre-
ventive services, and public awareness
campaigns.
Research shows that there is a dis-
parate impact of lung cancer on
women, especially women who have
never smoked. More research is needed
to understand why this is happening
and what can be done to stop it.
Preventing cancer should never be a
partisan issue. We should be working
together to combat the scourge of can-
cer for the benefit of patients, families,
and survivors. H.R. 2222 is a bipartisan
effort that would do just that.

STOP IMPEACHMENT FOCUS TO
DEAL WITH BORDER
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I
stand first of all to thank President
Trump for the work he has done at the
border and for something that has been
almost unpublicized since the main-
stream media is busy focusing solely
on impeachment.
In May of this year, over 100,000 peo-
ple were processed at the border and
placed in the United States. In Sep-
tember, that number has fallen to
under 1,000, solely because of the ef-
forts of President Trump to keep peo-
ple who come to this country seeking
asylum south of the border and because
of agreements reached in countries in
northern Central America.
However, we must ask this body to
stop solely focusing on impeachment
and deal with the southern border,
making permanent the policy changes
of President Trump. My fear is that if
President Trump ever leaves, then the
real motivation of this impeachment
hearing will become apparent, and that
is to return to the days of open borders.

pending which I yield myself such time
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker,
yesterday, the Rules Committee met
and reported a structured rule, House
Resolution 713, providing for consider-
ation of H.R. 1309, the Workplace Vio-
lence Prevention for Health Care and
Social Service Workers Act. The rule
provides 1 hour of debate equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and
the ranking member of the Committee
on Education and Labor, makes in
order all 10 amendments submitted,
and provides for a motion to recommit.
It also provides standard recess in-
structions for next week’s district
work period.
Madam Speaker, there is an epidemic
of violence against healthcare and so-
cial workers in the United States. Last
year, Department of Labor statistics
showed they were nearly five times as
likely to suffer a serious workplace vi-
olence injury than workers in other in-
dustries.
The Government Accountability Of-
fice found that rates of violence
against healthcare workers in hos-
pitals, nursing homes, and residential
care facilities are 5 to 12 times higher
than the estimated rates for workers
overall. Between 2011 and 2016, 58 hos-
pital workers died as a result of work-
place violence.
For me, this matter strikes close to
home. In 2010, a Napa State Hospital
technician in California, Donna Kay
Gross, a constituent, was killed outside
the State hospital by a patient under
psychiatric care. Donna entered the
profession to honor her mother, who
battled mental illness and was a pa-
tient at that very hospital. She was the
mother of three grown children and
was raising her granddaughter. Her col-
leagues described her by saying: First
and foremost, Donna was a human
service-type person and loved being
with people and working with people.
Donna’s life was cut short when a pa-
tient brutally murdered her to steal
jewelry and cash from her.
This story is just one of thousands of
incidents that are on the rise. Sadly,
violence has become so commonplace
for healthcare workers that they think
it is part of their job, resulting in only
30 percent of violent incidents being re-
ported.
Some States have stepped up to
enact laws to require employers to es-
tablish a plan to protect against work-
place violence. Donna’s story, for ex-
ample, inspired action in California
that I was proud to be a part of when
I was chair of the senate labor com-
mittee. That action in California
served as the basis for the bill before us
today in the rule and tomorrow on the
floor.
These workers deserve national ac-
tion, and they deserve it now. At the
Occupational Safety and Health Ad-
ministration, these workers are not re-
ceiving the urgent attention they need.
OSHA takes at least 7 years to put out
a standard, but in some instances can
take up to 20 years.
People like Donna Kay Gross cannot
wait that long. To protect the people
who dedicate their lives to caring for
us, we need to move now. The longer
we wait, the more people will suffer.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding the
customary 30 minutes, and I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, today, we are con-
sidering a bill that requires the Sec-
retary of Labor to issue a rule on work-
place violence prevention in the
healthcare and social service sectors.
According to the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration, workplace
violence is any act or threat of phys-
ical violence, harassment, intimida-
tion, or other threatening disruptive
behavior that occurs at the worksite.
It may be surprising to hear that acts
of violence are the third leading cause
of fatal occupational injuries. Of these
incidences, approximately 8 percent
were intentionally caused by another
person.
When Americans go to work each and
every day, they do not expect to face
violence or other harm. The risk is es-
pecially high for healthcare providers
and social workers. These caregivers
can be subject to patients who may not
be in control when under the influence
of medications, or they may have a
mental disorder, upset family mem-
bers, ongoing domestic disputes, and
even gang violence.
The rate of workplace violence re-
sulting in days away from work for
healthcare providers is, on average,
four times higher than other profes-
sions. In addition, healthcare providers
and social workers are less likely to re-
port incidents. This may partly be due
to the pledge to do no harm and the in-
clination to forgive patient-caused in-
juries as accidental. Regardless of the
situation, all workers deserve a safe
workplace.
The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration is responsible for set-
ting the standards to ensure the safety
of American workers. Under the gen-
eral duty clause of the Occupational
Safety and Health Act of 1970, employ-
ers must provide employees with a safe
work environment. Currently, there is
no mandatory standard on workplace
violence prevention. However, in cal-
endar year 2015, OSHA published
‘‘Guidelines for Preventing Workplace
Violence for Healthcare and Social
Service Workers’’ and is currently
working on a workplace violence pre-
vention rule.
H.R. 1309 would require the Secretary
of Labor to issue a rule on workplace

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

violence prevention based on OSHA’s
2015 guidelines. An interim standard is
required within 1 year of the passage of
this legislation, and a final rule must
be issued within 2 years.
While the goal of this legislation is
laudable and important, the timeframe
imposed on the Department of Labor
and OSHA does exceed the norm. Be-
tween 1981 and 2010, the time it took
OSHA to develop and issue safety and
health standards ranged from 15
months to 19 years, but the average
was more than 7 years. While no one
believes we should continue to delay
worker protections, OSHA has already
begun the rulemaking process and is
gathering stakeholder input.
According to the OSHA rulemaking
process, a rule should take 10 years to
complete. There are 7 stages comprised
of 48 different steps. For example, one
step is listed as ‘‘continue discussion
with stakeholders.’’ The penultimate
stage requires OSHA to send the final
rule to the Small Business Administra-
tion before submitting the rule to Con-
gress.
b 1245
This last stage involves developing a
small entity compliance guide respond-
ing to legal action.
This is bureaucracy at its finest.
While it is important to ensure that
any rulemaking does not adversely af-
fect the people and industries it is
meant to assist, the length of this
process far exceeds other administra-
tive rulemakings. Perhaps, rather than
pass a bill to require the issuance of a
single rule, we should be considering
reforms to the entire OSHA rule-
making process. It seems like that may
be overdue.
Despite the lengthy process of OSHA
rulemaking, as written, this bill trun-
cates established rulemaking proce-
dures. But that is up to us. Until Con-
gress changes this process, OSHA will
follow the established framework to
develop its workplace violence protec-
tion rule.
H.R. 1309 requires covered employees,
including hospitals, outpatient facili-
ties, residential treatment facilities—
which includes nursing homes—and
any other medical treatment or social
service clinic at correctional facilities
to develop and implement a written
workplace violence plan within 6
months of the issuance of a rule. The
plan must include identification of vio-
lence risks and prevention practices
and incorporate reporting and emer-
gency response procedures. In addition,
the plan must delineate violent inci-
dent investigation procedures and
training programs for employees.
Again, the importance of such a plan
is undeniable. Six months may be a
short timeframe within which to deter-
mine all of the required components. In
order to produce the most effective
plan to ensure employee safety, em-
ployers really should be granted ade-
quate time to fully evaluate their
workplace, gather input from employ-
ees, and identify the best procedures to
ensure a safe environment. It is pos-
sible that, given the short timeline,
workplace violence prevention plans
could be hasty and, therefore, incor-
rectly assembled.
Here is the good news. There is mid-
dle ground. While OSHA’s rulemaking
process is lengthy, this bill’s timeline
is short. OSHA is currently gathering
feedback from stakeholders and requir-
ing an expedited rulemaking that will
limit their input.
While OSHA rulemaking would en-
sure enforcement of workplace violence
prevention policies, according to a 2018
American Hospital Association survey,
97 percent of respondents reported al-
ready having a workplace violence pre-
vention policy in place. In 2009, the
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention stated that additional research
was required to identify effective strat-
egies to prevent violence, particularly
in healthcare settings.
In addition, the Congressional Budg-
et Office estimates that the cost to pri-
vate entities will be well over $2.5 bil-
lion the first 2 years of implementation
and almost $1.5 billion annually there-
after. The rule self-executes a man-
ager’s amendment that will bring this
cost down to $1.3 billion for the first 2
years and $700 million annually there-
after.
This mandate may make it difficult
for rural hospitals and healthcare pro-
viders to continue effectively serving
patients in their more rural locations.
Extending the implementation
timeline of this bill may help reduce
some of these concerns. We had an op-
portunity to work on a bipartisan
basis—this is not a partisan issue—to
solve a problem that we all agree needs
to be solved. We are, instead, consid-
ering a bill that circumvents the estab-
lished rulemaking process in favor of a
swift outcome.
We can all agree that there is a need
for OSHA to issue proper workplace vi-
olence prevention regulations to pro-
tect healthcare providers and social
workers. I hope we are able to accom-
plish this goal, but we should recognize
that we are placing burdens on entities
through an expedited process that may
require modification in the future to
ensure a safe and effective workplace
for all Americans.
Madam Speaker, for these and other
reasons, I urge opposition to the rule,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY), who has
put so much work into this effort.
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I
rise in support of the rule.
I would just note for the Record that
Mr. DESAULNIER and Chairman MCGOV-
ERN deserve great credit because this is
basically an open rule. There were
eight amendments which were offered
to the Rules Committee, and all eight
amendments were made in order, in-
cluding a Republican amendment,
which is somewhat in line with Dr.
BURGESS’ comments from Mr. BYRNE
from Alabama, who is on the com-
mittee.
Again, I would just say this shows
that the Rules Committee was serious
last January when they said we are
going to have a new era of bringing
down the number of closed rules as
much as possible. This is a perfect ex-
ample of it.
In fact, Politico this morning wrote a
story saying that this is actually the
first bill to come to the floor that was
a completely open rule that accepted
every amendment that was offered by
Members. I don’t know if that is true,
but certainly it is true that all amend-
ments were made in order with the rule
that is presented. I guess sometimes
you sort of wonder: When do people
take ‘‘yes’’ for an answer in this Cham-
ber?
Again, Mr. BYRNE can have ample op-
portunity to make his arguments. I
look forward to opposing it on the floor
as I did in committee. And again, to
me, it seems like a rule that all Mem-
bers should really support.
So again, just to begin with Mr.
DESAULNIER’s description of the prob-
lem—and, again, Dr. BURGESS certainly
did not quibble about the fact that this
is a real problem that we are talking
about. In 2013, former Congressman
George Miller and I asked GAO to look
at this problem. They took 3 years to
study it. They used Bureau of Labor
statistics, Justice Department statis-
tics, they did surveys, and they found,
in fact, that we have a really very
scary problem in terms of the 15 mil-
lion healthcare workers who go to
work every single day: They are five
times more likely to be the victims of
intentional assault than any other sec-
tor in the U.S. economy.
And what is most alarming is the
trajectory is going up. This is not a
problem which is sort of level normal
operations. It is something that is ac-
tually getting worse.
There is no secret why it is getting
worse. The heroin-opioid epidemic and
the behavioral health problems that
exist out there in society make every
ambulance call that EMTs are going
out for an overdose, every emergency
room patient who is coming through
the door, every rehab patient who is
going into a facility for treatment, all
of these now are high-risk situations.
And, yes, there are some hospitals
that have taken proactive steps. They
have used the OSHA voluntary guide-
lines; they have looked at the Joint
Commission on Hospitals, which has
endorsed those guidelines and has,
again, written strong advocacy in favor
of having a national standard for this
problem out there for many workers.
And that is why we need to act.
Again, just so we are clear, OSHA, in
2017, as the Obama administration was
leaving, put it on their regulatory
agenda. They took too long.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9071
November 20, 2019
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I
yield an additional 1 minute to the
gentleman from Connecticut.
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I
would be happy to stipulate they took
too long.
Since the Trump administration has
taken over, in 34 months, they have not
held one hearing in terms of stake-
holder input. Yes, they scheduled two
small business reg review hearings,
canceled both, and they have not re-
scheduled. So, 34 months into this ad-
ministration, there is nothing hap-
pening.
This bill, fundamentally, is about
Congress, as it did with bloodborne
pathogens, which addressed a crisis in
hospitals back in the 1990s and early
2000s—which a Republican Congress, by
the way, supported—put a deadline on
OSHA to get a rule in place. We are a
safer country because Congress took
that action. That is what this bill does.
It is 42 months, by the way, in terms
of the deadline for the rule and it is 1
year for the interim rule.
We accommodated Republican objec-
tions in the committee, made sure ev-
erybody gets a comment period on the
interim rule, and we also carved out
doctors offices, dentists offices, any-
body who is not part of the healthcare
facility. We shrunk the scope of this
bill to healthcare facilities 200,000,
which is going to reduce the mandate.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has again ex-
pired.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I
yield an additional 1 minute to the
gentleman from Connecticut.
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker,
the cost per facility, which Dr. BUR-
GESS referred to, which was reduced be-
cause of the reducing of the scope of
the bill, is $9,000 per facility per year.
So when we talk about the
healthcare sector and how much money
gets spent in it, how many patients
come through the door—and these are
not the small independent practice
doctors offices. These are healthcare
facilities. The fact of the matter is it is
$9,000 a year for 2 years, then it goes
down to $3,000 a year in terms of cost
and expense.
What is the benefit? Lower workers’
comp cost, less absenteeism, and trying
to improve the morale of the people
who are doing the right thing in this
country in terms of providing care for
those who need to be healed, consoled,
and cured.
We need to pass this bill.
Again, we made Mr. BYRNE’s amend-
ment in order, but we need to reject
that amendment which throws it back
to OSHA, whose batting average is
really a disgrace in terms of getting
rules through the process.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself 2 minutes.
Madam Speaker, just so that we are
technically accurate, the resolution in
front of us today, point number one, it
is a structured rule for H.R. 1309. This
is not an open rule. I have served in the
United States House of Representatives
when we had open rules, and it is a dif-
ferent environment.
Mr. COLE last night in the Rules
Committee did make a motion for an
open rule on this, saying: If you are
going to accept all these amendments,
maybe we should open the floor up to
all Members. This is an important
topic. Let’s get their input.
But the request for an open rule was
voted down in the Rules Committee. It
wasn’t really a suspenseful vote. The
Republican side lost 4–9, which is gen-
erally the way that works out in that
committee.
I am grateful that so many amend-
ments were made in order. I think that
is important. But I also feel obligated
to point out that under no cir-
cumstances should this be regarded as
an open rule. It is anything but.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Nevada (Mrs. LEE).
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, healthcare and so-
cial workers are some of the most dedi-
cated, least appreciated workers in this
country. They are the workers caring
for the sick, the elderly, and the most
vulnerable Americans, while usually
making just barely enough to get by.
A tough job is made even tougher by
the fact that these workers who are
treating workers in stress, often in pri-
vate settings, are five times as likely
to be the victims of workplace vio-
lence.
What does it say about our country
that we can’t protect those workers
who have dedicated their lives to pro-
tecting our most vulnerable citizens? It
is unfair, and the bottom line is this:
No person should feel unsafe in their
place of work.
The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, or OSHA, has the au-
thority to protect American caregivers
and healthcare workers from work-
place violence, but the reality is that
there is no nationwide OSHA standard
for how employers are supposed to pro-
tect their employees from workplace
violence. Not just that, but in 24
States, nearly half the country, public-
sector health and social service work-
ers are not covered by OSHA protec-
tions.
We have the responsibility and we
have the authority to protect Amer-
ica’s workers, but we have not given
our government or our businesses the
tools they need to protect hardworking
Americans from workplace violence.
The underlying bill of this rule will
change that.
The Workplace Violence Prevention
for Health Care and Social Service
Workers Act would require OSHA to
implement a standard for workplace
protections for healthcare and social
workers. It provides protections for
public-sector workers where none ex-
isted before, and it identifies risks, so-
lutions, training, and, importantly,
protections from retaliation for those
workers who report violence in the
workplace.
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to
support this underlying bill and uphold
our duty to keep every American safe.
b 1300
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, Republicans will amend
the rule to immediately consider H.R.
1869, the Restoring Investment in Im-
provements Act. This bill, which has
271 bipartisan cosponsors, would fix a
technical error in the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act to allow qualified improve-
ment property to depreciate over 15
years and be eligible for immediate ex-
penses.
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous
consent to insert the text of this
amendment into the RECORD, along
with extraneous material, immediately
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas?
There was no objection.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I
yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI) to fur-
ther explain the bill.
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I
rise to vote down the previous ques-
tion.
If we defeat the previous question,
Republicans will amend the rule to in-
clude the restoration of the 15-year
schedule for qualified improvement
property, or QIP, as part of H.R. 1309,
the Workplace Violence Prevention for
Healthcare and Social Service Workers
Act.
Madam Speaker, there is strong bi-
partisan support to fix QIP, which af-
fects restaurants, retailers, and other
leaseholders in every congressional dis-
trict in this country. There are 271 bi-
partisan cosponsors split nearly evenly
between Republicans and Democrats on
H.R. 1869, which I helped introduce to
resolve this issue.
Fixing QIP is a commonsense solu-
tion that would unleash investment,
create jobs, and help small businesses
grow. However, it also requires ur-
gency, and Congress must do every-
thing in our power to address this issue
as soon as possible.
I hope that we defeat the previous
question to ensure that restaurants, re-
tailers, and other small businesses are
able to unlock the full benefits of tax
reform and continue driving our Na-
tion’s economic growth forward.
Failing that, I sincerely hope that all
sides can come together before the end
of the year to enact this bipartisan,
commonsense piece of legislation.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote against the previous
question.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9072 November 20, 2019
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Just a couple of points to my friend
from Texas. He is correct on the open
process. However, we did allow for all
10 amendments that were submitted to
be accepted, and the final vote was 2–9,
understanding that that was a foregone
conclusion to many of us.
I would just say that this is such an
important issue in the urgency, and I
would like to join with my colleague to
fix the standard and the practice, and
to add funding so that the Department
can do it.
There is an urgency for problems like
this to be solved. We can save money in
the long run. When I was in local gov-
ernment, I was on the governing board
of our county hospital. Two of our five
floors were psych wards. We spent
hours and hours in closed sessions deal-
ing with liability issues on those
wards.
So when I read this bill, I think that
so much of what is in this bill, many of
us have already done, at least from
California at the local level and at the
State level, and it is good business
practice.
As somebody who is a former small
business owner that had high workers’
compensation in the restaurant busi-
ness, cost avoidance is a good thing.
My workers’ compensation carrier
came out at least once a year to in-
spect our facilities and see where we
could avoid these incidents. So it is
just a good business practice.
When I look at this, it makes so
much sense. There is a cost to start
this, but there is, clearly, in my mind,
a fiscal savings and an emotional sav-
ings when you think of the lives lost.
This is not new, but the demand in the
changing trend lines say to me that
this is urgent.
So I would like to agree with my
friend from Texas and I would be happy
to work with him, but with incidents
like this, this Department really needs
to be ramped up. It is a national em-
barrassment that it takes 20 years, or 7
years for the Department to do these
rules, understanding that you have to
work with stakeholders.
So I think there is an element of op-
portunity here for us. I do think that it
is unfortunate, as we talked about in
the Rules Committee last night, and
Mr. BYRNE talked about, that we
couldn’t get across the finish line and
come together completely as a bipar-
tisan bill.
Having said that, as my friend from
Texas alluded to, this is a bipartisan
bill. We do have supporters, including
Mr. COLE.
Madam Speaker, I have no other
speakers, and I understand that the
gentleman has no additional speakers,
so I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from California for his com-
ments, and I would agree that the effi-
cient functioning of any Federal agen-
cy should always be our highest pri-
ority. The efficient use of the taxpayer
funding that goes into those agencies
or branches of agencies should require
our constant attention. We should al-
ways be looking to improve the service
and the protection that those agencies
provide.
I will also predict that this bill is
likely to pass with a large margin and
it will be bipartisan and will raise the
question of why we are not considering
it under a suspension of the rules. Nev-
ertheless, that is what the majority
has chosen to use their time doing this
week, so we have the bill in front of us
today.
Workplace violence is a threat that
no American should have to face. The
threat is particularly high for
healthcare providers and for social
service workers. These workers dedi-
cate their lives to taking care of oth-
ers, and they deserve to be taken care
of in return.
I support the goal of this legislation.
I believe it would benefit from further
discussion to ensure that the timeline
for issuing a rule and developing a
workplace violence prevention plan
will produce the most effective and
safe outcome for American workers.
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote
on the previous question and a ‘‘no’’
vote on the rule, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my
colleague from Texas for his com-
ments.
Democratic and Republican adminis-
trations have sat idly by while
healthcare and social service workers
are being beaten, abused, and killed.
The problem is not going away. It is
getting worse.
In the words of the ranking member
of the Rules Committee, the distin-
guished gentleman from Oklahoma, he
will be voting for the bill because it is
better than what we have got. I cer-
tainly agree.
This bill does far better for our front-
line workers who we ask to care for us
every day. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the
rule and the previous question.
The text of the material previously
referred to by Mr. BURGESS is as fol-
lows:
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 713

lowing:

November 20, 2019
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California (Mr. HUFFMAN).
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material
on the measure under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
H.R. 182, introduced by Representa-
tive BILL KEATING from Massachusetts,
would reauthorize the Cape Cod Na-
tional Seashore Advisory Commission,
which expired under current law in
September 2018. This bill would reau-
thorize and extend it until 2028.
Since the national seashore was
originally created in 1961, it was actu-
ally the first national seashore. It is
the second most beautiful national sea-
shore, but it was the first national sea-
shore created.
The advisory commission has served
as a main forum for consultation and
coordination between local commu-
nities and the National Park Service.
Comprised of representatives from the
six towns within the park, Barnstable
County, the Commonwealth of Massa-
chusetts, and the Secretary of the Inte-
rior, this advisory commission gives
surrounding communities a voice in
the management of the seashore.
I thank Representative KEATING for
his leadership in introducing this im-
portant legislation, and I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 182.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
H.R. 182, which extends the authoriza-
tion of the Cape Cod National Seashore
Advisory Commission until 2028.
The Cape Cod National Seashore was
established in 1961. It comprises more
than 40,000 acres on Cape Cod, Massa-
chusetts. The enabling legislation also
provided for an advisory commission
comprised of six Cape Cod communities
located within the seashore and the
county to consult with the Secretary
of the Interior about the development
of the seashore. This is as it should be.
The Federal Government must be a
good neighbor to the communities that
its lands impact, and consulting them
as partners is a fundamental point of
this principle.
One of the unique aspects of this ad-
visory commission is that the Sec-
retary of the Interior cannot issue
commercial, industrial, or recreational
permits without the advice of the com-
mission, as long as action is taken in a
timely manner.
In addition, the commission meets
regularly with the park superintendent
to discuss specific seashore issues and
to advise him about seashore programs,
facilities, and activities, providing val-
uable local feedback to the national
seashore. This feedback helps to pro-
mote sound park management, improve
public access, and it ensures that the
National Park Service is a good neigh-
bor to its surrounding communities.
This is a model of how the Federal
Government’s land managers should be
governed. My only regret is that its
provisions don’t apply to every commu-
nity affected by Federal landholdings. I
cannot help but note that the Federal
Government owns just 1.2 percent of
Massachusetts while giving great def-
erence to its local communities. Mean-
while, it owns 46 percent of my State of
California and often gives local com-
munities impacted by its lands a
dismissive brushoff, which is typical of
the experience of our Western States.
In fact, I take this opportunity to
ask my colleagues from Massachusetts
to consider what would happen to their
communities if the Federal Govern-
ment took over half of the land in their
State, removed it from the tax rolls,
severely restricted any productive use
of that land, and then thumbed its nose
at the concerns and complaints of local
communities.
Thankfully, this administration has
taken a cooperative and supportive po-
sition in recent years and has improved
conditions greatly, but that doesn’t
guarantee that future administrations
won’t revert to the Washington-knows-
best approach that has produced no end
of problems for the people of our West-
ern States.
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of
the measure, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I
yield as much time as he may consume
to the gentleman from Massachusetts
(Mr. KEATING), who is honored to rep-
resent the second most beautiful na-
tional seashore in America.
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I
rise in support of my bill, H.R. 182, to
reauthorize the Cape Cod National Sea-
shore Advisory Commission.
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair
from the Committee on Natural Re-
sources for yielding, and I thank both
of my colleagues from California for
supporting this bill.
The Cape Cod National Seashore was
created by President Kennedy in 1961.
His vision was to preserve the unique
landscape of the outer cape for recre-
ation and enjoyment for all Americans
forever. Today, more than 4 million
people, both Americans and those from
around the world, travel to Cape Cod
every year to experience the natural
beauty and recreation that the Cape
Cod National Seashore provides.
However, when the Cape Cod Na-
tional Seashore was proposed, it pre-
sented challenges to residents of Cape
Cod unique to locating a national park
on a peninsula with a limited area and
with very small communities within
that area. In many of the communities
in the outer cape, the national sea-
shore was designed to occupy as much
as 80 percent of the available land, ef-
fectively foreclosing other economic
development options after the park was
established.
While the promise of President Ken-
nedy’s vision for the outer cape was re-
alized, with the national seashore
drawing millions of people from around
the world to the cape, the importance
of the advisory commission to the na-
tional seashore and its host commu-
nities is still important today, as im-
portant as it was almost 60 years ago.
The advisory commission was at the
heart of President Kennedy’s vision for
the national seashore, as he recognized
that the host communities would need
a voice in the national seashore affairs
after the park was formed. To this end,
it was important that the host commu-
nities retained a formal structure to
advise seashore leadership and the
Park Service about how actions taken
within the park would affect them and
their communities.
The reasons for the powers granted
to the advisory commission in its ena-
bling legislation are just as persuasive
today as they were in 1961. Since what
happens on the seashore directly af-
fects the lives of thousands of my con-
stituents in the host communities,
those decisions should be made with
the input of those communities.
Some have suggested that the au-
thority regarding the commercial ac-
tivity granted to the National Sea-
shore Advisory Commission in its ena-
bling legislation is no longer necessary.
This is simply not the case.
Suggestions that the value of having
regulatory unity among the national
parklands and the various advisory
commissions are unpersuasive when
one considers the unique nature of
Cape Cod. That such a bureaucratic
consideration could possibly outweigh
the important benefits that the Na-
tional Seashore Advisory Commission
provides to my constituents is just
laughable.
Today, just as in the 1960s, the
unique nature of the outer cape pre-
sents the same challenges to those who
live there with respect to the national
seashore. The most effective way to ad-
dress the concerns of the outer cape
community is to ensure that a func-
tioning advisory commission is sitting
and can continue to play its important
role in the community.
Long ago, President Kennedy envi-
sioned what responsible self-govern-
ance looks like on the outer cape, a
balance between the seashore, the
towns, and a place where all parties
could come together, again, in the spir-
it of sustaining the community as a
whole. That is the vision of the advi-
sory commission.
Over the past few years, the outer
cape region has faced some of its
toughest challenges. With climate
change, coastal erosion, ocean acidifi-
cation, and new concerns about sharks
in the waters off Cape Cod, Cape
Codders are grappling with some of the

sence is felt every day.
Madam Speaker, that is why I ask
my colleagues to support this straight-
forward piece of legislation, a bill that

tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
H.R. 255, introduced by Representa-
tive COOK, would authorize an equal
value exchange between the U.S. For-
est Service and San Bernardino Coun-
ty. This exchange would enable the
county to build a resource conserva-
tion and recovery facility. This will in-
crease efficiency and safety of timber
processing and recycling in that area.
In return, the Forest Service would re-
ceive an undeveloped inholding in the
San Bernardino National Forest.
The bill is a perfect example of how,
through a collaborative process, we can
meet the needs of local stakeholders
while continuing to protect our envi-
ronment and public lands.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to con-
gratulate and thank my colleague,
Representative COOK, for introducing
this legislation, and I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9075
November 20, 2019
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 255, introduced by
the gentleman from California (Mr.
COOK), authorizes a locally supported
equal value land exchange between the
Forest Service and San Bernardino
County. The county has proposed to
convey an inland parcel within the San
Bernardino National Forest to the For-
est Service in exchange for land further
north to be conveyed by the county.
The land conveyed by the county will
allow needed forest management infra-
structure to be located closer to the
forest and promote road safety by re-
ducing the need to drive forest prod-
ucts down narrow, winding roads.
H.R. 255 also authorizes cooperation
between the county and the Forest
Service to relocate a portion of the Pa-
cific Crest National Scenic Trail, if
needed, and requires that the trail relo-
cation be completed before the ex-
change is consummated.
This legislation is the result of a
Congressman who has listened to the
voices of his community, an adminis-
tration sympathetic to the plight of
our forest communities, and commu-
nity members and their local rep-
resentatives putting forward a reason-
able and workable plan that is fair to
all parties.
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the
measure, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from southern California
(Mr. AGUILAR).
Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman from California of-
fering me some time, and I want to
thank Representative COOK, as well, for
his efforts.
I rise in support of the Big Bear Land
Exchange Act.
My community in San Bernardino
County experiences some of the highest
levels of air pollution anywhere in the
country, and, in order to combat this
pollution, we must find ways to reduce
emissions in our region. This bill will
help us do just that.
This land exchange between the
county and the Federal Government
will allow the establishment of a recy-
cling and recovery center in my neigh-
boring district. This facility would de-
crease the long distances that trucks
have to travel to dispose of waste and
will allow us to divert this waste by
repurposing recyclable materials.
This legislation is good for our com-
munities and is a smart way to help
mitigate pollution and combat climate
change.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank
my colleague, Representative COOK, for
his work in championing this bill and
for his bipartisan collaboration. I have
worked with Mr. COOK on a number of
issues representing San Bernardino
County. Nobody is more thoughtful
when it comes to what our future di-
rection holds. I know his heart is in
San Bernardino County, as well, and no
one will ever doubt that about his in-
tent.
Just because he doesn’t want to hang
out here with us in this facility often-
times doesn’t mean that he isn’t pub-
licly driven and publicly minded in
order to deliver for his constituents.
This bill is one of those examples.
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to work-
ing with my colleague the remainder of
the next 12 months and in the years
ahead, and I want to thank him for his
efforts in this regard.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I share my colleague’s high words of
praise and warmth for our colleague,
Mr. COOK, the author of this measure,
and I am also somewhat annoyed with
him for his decision to leave the Con-
gress at the end of this session for the
county board of supervisors.
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
California (Mr. COOK).
Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr.
MCCLINTOCK for yielding his time.
I had my speech all prepared, but I
am not sure whether it is a San
Bernardino lovefest or a beat up on
PAUL COOK because he is leaving this
institution.
This is an example. Everybody knows
that you can work together; you can
put your differences aside and get
things done. I pride myself on that. I
am very, very passionate about certain
things.
This bill sounds simple, the pollution
going up and down that hill; but, more
so, anyone who has lived in a mountain
community knows how dangerous it is,
particularly in the winter, and more so
with a truck with timber on it, the
number of accidents that we have on
those roads up there—just the deaths—
every year. We have always had prob-
lems, and it is something I am very,
very concerned about.
I do want to commend working with
the Pacific Crest Trail Association,
working together so we could iron out
some of these things.
The relocation, as I think was al-
ready mentioned, will include environ-
mental review and will take care be-
fore the exchange takes place.
And we have got a lot of people on
this: the city of Big Bear Lake, the
Friends of Big Bear Valley, Big Bear
Fire Department.
By the way, there are big bears up
there. If you haven’t met one there,
stay off the highways.
Anyway, the Big Bear City Commu-
nity Services Department, the water
district, the community healthcare,
the chamber of commerce, and the
local Big Bear chapter of the Sierra
Club—and they have been great on
this.
It passed out of the House Natural
Resources Committee on a unanimous,
bipartisan vote. Last December, nearly
identical language passed out of the
House as H.R. 5513 with overwhelming
bipartisan support.
I appreciate the comments—even the
sarcastic comments—of my colleagues,
and I truly am going to miss this insti-
tution.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
I assure my friend, they are not sar-
castic. He will be sorely missed in this
House.
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this
measure and urge my colleague to
change his mind and come back next
session, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I want to associate myself with the
other comments about how much we
are going to miss Colonel Cook. We re-
spect him. We admire him. We are
amused by him.
Let the record show he just called
the Sierra Club great. I want that to be
noted.
And although he has found a way,
through this bill, to create an equal
value exchange, something tells me
that in the exchange of Colonel Cook,
because we are losing him, the County
of San Bernardino is making out a lot
better than this institution. So I wish
him well and urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on his
good bill.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
KEATING). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentleman from
California (Mr. HUFFMAN) that the
House suspend the rules and pass the
bill, H.R. 255, as amended.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as
amended, was passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

CONGRESSMAN LESTER WOLFF
OYSTER BAY NATIONAL WILD-
LIFE REFUGE
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I move
to suspend the rules and pass the bill
(H.R. 263) to rename the Oyster Bay
National Wildlife Refuge as the Con-
gressman Lester Wolff Oyster Bay Na-
tional Wildlife Refuge.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 263
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. FINDINGS.
The Congress finds the following:
(1) The Oyster Bay National Wildlife Ref-
uge was created in 1968. It is located on the
north shore of Long Island in eastern Nassau
County, is the largest refuge in the Long Is-
land National Wildlife Refuge Complex, and
receives the most public use of all the ref-
uges in the Complex.
(2) The State of New York designated Oys-
ter Bay a significant coastal fish and wildlife
habitat. It is especially important for win-
tering waterfowl such as black duck, greater
scaup, bufflehead, canvasback and long-
tailed ducks. Management activities include
wetland restoration and protection of the
natural shoreline and vegetation.

(3) The refuge is unique in consisting solely
of bay bottom and adjacent shoreline up to
the mean high-tide mark. Ninety percent of
New York’s commercial oyster harvest
comes from the refuge. Visitors enjoy fish-
ing, wildlife observation, photography and
environmental education. The refuge is truly
a national treasure.
(4) Many visitors are unaware that were it
not for the tireless work and advocacy of
then-freshman Congressman Lester Wolff,
this area would today be an 8.5-mile cause-
way and bridge across Long Island Sound be-
tween Oyster Bay and Rye, New York, con-
necting Nassau and Westchester Counties.
(5) The bridge was first proposed by Robert
Moses, the well-known New York City Plan-
ner, to divert traffic from New York City.
Former Governor Nelson Rockefeller signed
into law legislation creating the bridge au-
thorized by the New York State Legislature
in 1967.
(6) Congressman Wolff, elected in 1964,
quickly decided the bridge would be an intru-
sion in a pristine area, and that Long Island
Sound was a very precious resource that was
despoiled. The conservation threats in the
mid-1960s were suburban development, wet-
land filling, and industrial pollution. The
fight to preserve this land became an enor-
mous political fight and is considered to be a
turning point in New York State’s environ-
mental legacy.
(7) With State and local political and com-
munity leaders, and especially the North
Shore leaders and the Committee to Save the
Long Island Sound, Congressman Wolff ar-
ranged a meeting with Department of the In-
terior representatives and local leaders
where the idea of creating a wildlife refuge
from municipal and privately owned wet-
lands was created.
(8) The Town of Oyster Bay, in which one
end of the bridge was to be located, deeded
5,000 acres of wetlands to the United States
to be maintained as a Federal wildlife pre-
serve. It was stipulated that if the Depart-
ment of the Interior agreed to an intrusion
of the property, it would revert to the town.
Creating a Federal wildlife preserve provided
the land with Federal protection.
(9) Because of the vision, dedication, and
perseverance of Congressman Lester Wolff,
all of us and future generations can enjoy
the beauty and magnificence of this refuge.
SEC. 2. RENAMING THE OYSTER BAY NATIONAL
WILDLIFE REFUGE AS THE CON-
GRESSMAN LESTER WOLFF OYSTER
BAY NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE.
(a) RENAMING.—The unit of the National
Wildlife Refuge System known as the Oyster
Bay National Wildlife Refuge and located
near Oyster Bay, New York, shall be known
as the ‘‘Congressman Lester Wolff Oyster
Bay National Wildlife Refuge’’.
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law,
map, regulation, document, paper, or other
record of the United States to the unit of the
National Wildlife Refuge System known as
the Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge is
deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Congress-
man Lester Wolff Oyster Bay National Wild-
life Refuge’’.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
California (Mr. HUFFMAN) and the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCCLIN-
TOCK) each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California (Mr. HUFFMAN).
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, this bill would rename
the Oyster Bay National Wildlife Ref-
uge in New York as the Congressman
Lester Wolff Oyster Bay National Wild-
life Refuge.
A long-time Congressman from Long
Island, Congressman Wolff was instru-
mental in creating this refuge and pro-
tecting it from unnecessary develop-
ment. Thanks to his hard work and vi-
sion, the Oyster Bay refuge is an im-
portant stopover for wintering water-
fowl, and it is also a popular destina-
tion for outdoor recreation enthu-
siasts.
At 100 years old, Congressman Wolff
is the oldest living Member of Con-
gress. This bill is a fitting tribute to
him for his years of conservation lead-
ership, and I urge its adoption.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, as my friend said, this
bill renames the Oyster Bay National
Wildlife Refuge in honor of Congress-
man Lester Wolff, former Long Island-
North Shore Congressman.
It is certainly appropriate to recog-
nize and honor Congressman Wolff’s
distinguished eight-term career rep-
resenting the people of New York by
adding his name to the wildlife refuge
that he fought so hard to create.
This refuge has become a popular
destination for many Americans to
enjoy the wildlife and beauty of our
outdoor spaces, and, at 100 years of age,
Congressman Wolff has the distinction
of being the oldest living former Mem-
ber of Congress.
Mr. Speaker, it is most fitting we
honor a man so dedicated and who has
put so much of his life into fighting to
protect and conserve this place and
fighting for his constituency. I urge
adoption of the measure, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
5 minutes to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. SUOZZI), who is the sponsor
of this bill.
Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Mr. HUFFMAN for allowing me this
time.
I rise today in support of this bill
that I have sponsored, a bipartisan bill,
H.R. 263, which, as has been mentioned,
would rename the Oyster Bay National
Wildlife Refuge as the Congressman
Lester Wolff Oyster Bay National Wild-
life Refuge.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chair-
man GRIJALVA. I want to thank, again,
Congressman HUFFMAN and my col-
leagues on the Natural Resources Com-
mittee for their work on this bill, as
well as the members of the New York
delegation, all of whom are cosponsors
of and support this legislation.
Congressman Lester Wolff, who rep-
resented my district for 16 years, is our
Nation’s oldest living former Congress-
man, and, in January, he will turn 101
years old.
The renaming of the Oyster Bay Na-
tional Wildlife Refuge in his honor is in
recognition of his monumental con-
tributions to the preservation and pro-
tection of our environment.
These precious wetlands, at Con-
gressman Lester Wolff’s urging, were
protected in 1968. It was in 1967 that
the New York State Legislature, at the
insistence of then-Governor Nelson
Rockefeller and the master planner,
Robert Moses, authorized a bridge
across the Long Island Sound.
Lester immediately saw the bridge
would despoil this pristine and precious
resource of the Long Island Sound and
soon found himself at the center of an
enormous political fight. Lester even-
tually won this fight, and the Oyster
Bay Wildlife Refuge was born. Today,
it covers over 3,200 acres of one of the
most important areas for natural ref-
uge anywhere on the north shore of
Long Island and is home to many en-
dangered species.
Not only was Lester a champion for
our environment, he also served our
Nation honorably in our military. Les-
ter served in the Civil Air Patrol dur-
ing World War II and commanded the
Congressional Squadron of the Civil
Air Patrol, rising to the rank of colo-
nel.
In 2014, Wolff received the Congres-
sional Gold Medal, the highest civilian
award.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
also support this legislation so we may
honor this great Congressman whose
efforts were an important part of our
Nation’s environmental history.

Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I
ask for adoption of the measure, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I will
close by commending Representative
SUOZZI for his bipartisan initiative to
honor the legacy of Congressman Les-
ter Wolff. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this
bill, and I yield back the balance of my
time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from California (Mr.
HUFFMAN) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 263.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.

manner consistent with the license or permit
and is—
(1) destroyed or discarded upon separation;
(2) used for noncommercial subsistence
purposes in accordance with State or terri-
torial law;
(3) used solely for display or research pur-
poses by a museum, college, or university, or

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
California (Mr. HUFFMAN) and the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCCLIN-
TOCK) each will control 20 minutes.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, this bill would make it
legal to possess, buy, or sell shark fins
in the United States.
Now, everyone knows sharks are in
trouble. Around the globe, one-quarter
of sharks and their relatives are
threatened with extinction. They are
being caught and killed on average 30
percent faster than they can reproduce,
in large part due to the demand for
their fins to fuel the global shark fin
trade. The fins from as many as 73 mil-
lion sharks enter the shark fin trade
every single year.
As top predators in the oceans, they
play a critical role in ecosystems im-
pacting our fisheries, coral reefs, and
tourism economies. The concern for de-
clining shark populations and the im-
pact of their loss and the impact that
loss has on ecosystems and tourism
alike has led to increased efforts to
conserve sharks globally, including no-
take marine reserves, species-specific
fishing bans, and shark fin trade bans.
While the United States has banned
the practice of shark finning, we have
not banned the buying and selling of
shark fins, which means that we are
still a part of the problem.
States and the private sector are
catching on. Already 12 States, three
territories, 40 airlines, and 20 major
international shipping companies and
other corporations such as Amazon,
Disney, Hilton, and Grubhub have all
refused to partake in this trade that
devastates shark populations around
the world.
And just this year Canada passed a
similar bill, in large part thanks to our
efforts here. That is the intention of
this bill. When the United States steps
up to lead, others will follow.
H.R. 737 would build on the leader-
ship of these States, territories, and
companies by eliminating shark fin
sales and possession in the United
States.
In addition to its 287 bipartisan co-
sponsors, this bill enjoys the support of
recreational fishing interests, aquar-
iums, over 150 scientists, 150 chefs, over
300 dive businesses and over 130 non-
profits. With this overwhelming sup-
port and at a time when so many shark
populations are depleted, it is of ut-
most importance that we pass this leg-
islation.
Mr. Speaker, I want to commend
Congressman SABLAN for his leadership
and also Congressman MCCAUL for his
leadership on this bill, and I urge my
colleagues to support it.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a
bumper sticker bill that purports to
save the sharks, but in reality would
damage shark fisheries, destroy Amer-
ican jobs, and increase the threats to
endangered species.
Let’s first define what we agree on.
Killing a shark solely to take its fins is
contemptible. It is immoral. Herman
Melville called such wanton waste blas-
phemous.
But let us be clear: This practice is
already illegal under Federal law. It
has been that way since 1993. American
fishermen are not the villains in this
story, they are the heroes who are ad-
hering to rigorous regulations that re-
quire them to account for the full use
of their catches.
So what does this bill do? It does ex-
actly what it purports to abhor. Pro-
ponents rightly denounce taking the
fins and then throwing away the car-
cass, so they have come up with a bill
that would take the carcass but throw
away the fins. This bill makes it illegal
to possess or purchase a shark fin. The
fins are 50 percent of the value of the
catch.
If you force shark fishermen to waste
literally 50 percent of the value of their
catch, you remove their margin and de-
stroy their enterprise. And this does
little to stop the illegal trade of shark
fins, since almost all of the demand is
in east and Southeast Asia, and that
market will simply apply upward pres-
sure on the illegal taking of shark fins.
The responsible management of our
U.S. fisheries and the exemplary con-
duct of U.S. fishermen has resulted in a
great success story. Since 2000, the do-
mestic shark population has been
growing. The index of shark abundance
in 2015 was the highest in its 29-year
history.
Now, if you force fishermen to throw
away 50 percent of the value of each
shark they catch, one of two things are
going to happen. To stay in business,
they will have to take more and more
sharks to make up for their loss, or
more likely for American fishermen,
they will simply go out of business.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9078 November 20, 2019
If it is the latter, we can expect an
out-of-control explosion in shark popu-
lations with devastating consequences
for endangered marine species, like the
right whale. And in either case, Amer-
ican fishermen will suffer to the advan-
tage of the unregulated illegal foreign
fishing fleets.
This is an example of two develop-
ments that we have had to watch on
the Natural Resources Committee
since the Democrats took control.
The first is their tendency to cater to
emotional pressure groups who have
been successful at raising large sums of
money by tugging at the heartstrings
of gullible donors, but whose bromides
end up doing enormous harm to the
very populations they purport to pro-
tect. Indeed, the Wildlife Conservation
Society recently submitted a letter
warning of this signed by 60 of our Na-
tion’s leading scientific experts in
shark science and fisheries.
The second is the tendency to blame
Americans first for the excesses and
predations of bad foreign actors.
Time and again, American fishermen,
American growers, and American con-
sumers have proven to be the law-abid-
ing, conservation-minded, responsible
practitioners of a sustainable practice.
But the Democrats continue to impose
punitive and destructive measures on
them to atone for the irresponsible ac-
tions of foreign nations.
Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of the
measure, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I would
just note, that in California, where I
authored a very similar ban on the pos-
session, sale, and trade of shark fins,
the sky has not fallen, the world has
not ended. All of the calamities that
my friend just predicted have not
taken place, and guess what, there con-
tinues to be a sustainable shark fishery
for the meat without contributing to
the global shark fin trade that is driv-
ing the decimation of shark popu-
lations around the world.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the
gentleman from The Northern Mariana
Islands (Mr. SABLAN), the author of
this bill.
Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
support of my bill, H.R. 737, the Shark
Fin Sales Elimination Act.
The act bans the buying and selling
of shark fins in the United States, and
this widely supported bipartisan bill
has gathered 287 cosponsors. A com-
panion bill, S. 877, has been introduced
in the Senate as well.
Now, Mr. Speaker, this is the largest
number of cosponsors for any ocean
conservation bill so far in this Con-
gress, and I want to thank my good
friend and the distinguished Member
from Texas, the Honorable MICHAEL
MCCAUL who has worked tirelessly
with me on the bill and brings with
him the support of 68 Members from his
side of the aisle.
This bill has such strong support be-
cause it represents an effective way to
remove the United States from the dev-
astating global trade in shark fins at
zero cost, and because it does so with-
out stopping those who want to fish for
sharks and use them for their meat.
Mr. Speaker, sharks are absolutely
critical to life in the ocean. As apex
predators, they help maintain balance
by keeping prey populations in check.
They are also critical to the tourism
economy off our coastal communities.
In Florida alone, tourists who go div-
ing to see sharks generate more than
200 times the value of the trade in
shark fins for our entire country, 200
times the value.
Despite their importance eco-
logically and economically, sharks are
in serious trouble. Each year fins from
up to 73 million sharks are sliced off
and sold in a global marketplace. And
largely due to this demand for fins,
some shark species in the population
have now declined by more than 90 per-
cent.
Our Nation has wisely banned the in-
humane practice of finning sharks and
throwing them back into the ocean to
drown and die, yet we still allow fins to
be bought and sold here. And many of
the fins we are buying and selling come
from countries that simply do not have
the same level of protection the United
States gives sharks.
Now is the time for us to take the
next step. Only by banning the shark
fin trade once and for all within our
borders can we ensure we are no longer
supporting an unsustainable use of
ocean resources. Recognizing this
unsustainability, The Northern Mar-
iana Islands, my home, was the first
U.S. insular area to ban the trade of
shark fins in 2011.
As an island culture 3,000-plus years
old, the people of the Marianas under-
stand and respect the important role
that sharks play in maintaining the
life of our oceans. And we are not
alone. Twelve U.S. states and two ter-
ritories have also passed their own
shark fin bans.
But this patchwork of State laws can
be challenging to enforce, and so this is
why we need a Federal ban on the
shark fin trade in the United States,
and that is why I am asking for your
support today.
A ban on the shark fin trade is sup-
ported by 45 domestic and inter-
national airlines, by 21 shipping com-
panies, seven major corporations and
more than 645 U.S. businesses and orga-
nizations.
A 2016 national poll found four of five
Americans supported a national ban on
the buying and selling of shark fins.
Hundreds of scientists, chefs, fishers,
dive, and surf businesses have written
to Congress requesting passage of a na-
tional shark fin ban.
Mr. Speaker, it is time for this House
to act. Please join me by voting ‘‘yes’’
on this critical bill. Vote ‘‘yes’’ to con-
serve our oceans and the all-important
sharks that live in those waters.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I might con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, my friend from Cali-
fornia says that, well, California’s ban
hasn’t resulted in any calamities. What
he forgets is that virtually all shark
fisheries in the United States are found
in Florida, Louisiana, and North Caro-
lina. Banning shark finning in Cali-
fornia is like banning buffalo hunting
in Rhode Island; there just isn’t any.
My friend from the Marianas tells us
that there are 73 million shark fins in
the global market annually. That is a
very misleading statement. It comes
from a report published by Shelley
Clarke. That report gives a range of be-
tween 26 and 73 million and makes no
differentiation between legally and il-
legally obtained fins, which, unfortu-
nately, is a defect in this bill itself.
Mr. Speaker, for a different opinion,
however, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL).
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from California for
yielding.
I rise in support of this bill to help
end the inhumane practice of shark fin-
ning. After a shark’s fins are removed,
these majestic creatures are thrown
into the ocean to die, and multiple spe-
cies face extinction.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my
friend, Congressman SABLAN, for his
courageous leadership to introduce this
bill, which I strongly support.
The United States banned shark fin-
ning. Now we must end the shark fin
trade. Major retailers, airliners, and
shipping companies refuse to ship or
sell shark fin products. And 12 states,
including my home State of Texas have
bans on shark fin trading. It is time for
a Federal ban, Mr. Speaker.
The United States led in ending the
trade of trafficking ivory and rhino
horns, and now we must lead in the
shark fin trade itself.
Mr. Speaker, I wanted to end and
close with a personal thanks to my
wife, Linda, who is an oceanographer
who spent many years serving our
country in Naval intelligence tracking
Soviet submarines, and now she tracks
sharks by tagging sharks and following
them around the world as they exist.

As she told me when she returned
from Guadeloupe Island, on the very
same boat that Peter Benchley went
out on as he saw the majestic great
white shark, in his words, he says that
the greatest regret of his life was writ-
ing the book ‘‘Jaws.’’
I thank Delegate SABLAN, and I
thank my wife, Linda, for great testi-
mony before this committee. I stand in
strong support, and I hope my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle will
join us on this momentous day.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, just an-
other shout-out to Congressman
MCCAUL and his wife, who was a fan-
tastic witness at the hearing we had on
this bill at the Natural Resources Com-
mittee, and also for the leadership of
the State of Texas and so many other
States, territories, and leaders in the

private sector who understand we have
to end this terribly wasteful and cruel
global shark fin trade.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.
CUNNINGHAM).
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker,
down in South Carolina’s Lowcountry,
we all understand the importance of a
healthy ocean and healthy coastlines,
and sharks are a part of that story. Un-
fortunately, many populations of
sharks have severely declined due to
the demand for their fins. In South
Carolina, we have not imported or ex-
ported any shark fins in recent years,
and a large number of constituents
have contacted me in support of this
legislation.
Support for this ban is growing
across the country. Twelve U.S. States
already have shark fin bans. Private
companies are also refusing to ship or
sell shark fin products.
Just earlier this year, Canada be-
came the first G20 country to ban the
shark fin trade. The United States has
already banned the act of shark fin-
ning, but we continue to import fins
from countries that don’t have their
own finning bans.
Disturbingly, in the United States,
our own government data shows that
less than 20 percent of our U.S. shark
stocks are sustainably managed. It is
time for the United States to end its
role in the shark fin trade and stop
contributing to the decline of our
shark populations.
I am grateful to Delegate SABLAN and
Chairman GRIJALVA from the Natural
Resources Committee for their leader-
ship on this issue. Also, I thank For-
eign Affairs Committee Ranking Mem-
ber MCCAUL for his leadership.
Ending the shark fin trade will re-
quire a death by a thousand cuts, and
we have the opportunity to make a big
cut right now. Let’s pass the Shark Fin
Sales Elimination Act.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, my
friend from Texas compared banning
shark fins to banning ivory. Of course,
the difference is that the U.S. was a
major consumer of ivory. It is 1 percent
of the entire global shark fin market.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.
GRAVES).
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from
California for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I want to be upfront. I
have caught dozens of sharks in my
life. I have released every single one of
them intact. I have never gone shark
fishing. It was unintentional catch. I
have never eaten a shark, never had
shark fin soup, nor have I any inten-
tion or desire to have any of this. But
I do represent a State that does have a
shark industry that sustainably har-
vests those.
Mr. Speaker, I think that it is our
obligation to actually go to scientists
and to go to fisheries managers to get
their opinion on what it is that we
ought to be doing here.
So, Mr. Speaker, I include in the
RECORD a letter from our Democratic
Governor’s administration where they
talk about this bill.
STATE OF LOUISIANA, DEPARTMENT
OF WILDLIFE AND FISHERIES,
Baton Rouge, LA, July 7, 2017.
Re Shark Fin Trade Elimination Act of 2017,
S. 793, H.R. 1456.
Mr. ACY COOPER,
President, Louisiana Shrimp Association,
Grand Isle, Louisiana.
ACY: As requested by you on June 7, 2017,
the department has reviewed the text of Sen-
ate bill 793 and House Resolution 1456, also
known as the ‘‘Shark Fin Trade Elimination
Act of 2017’’ and the ‘‘Shark Fin Sales Elimi-
nation Act of 2017’’, respectively. The bills,
in their current form, would place unneces-
sary economic burdens on Louisiana shark
fishermen. As long as responsible manage-
ment is in place, which is currently the case
for sharks in the Gulf of Mexico, there is no
need for this legislation.
The purpose of these bills as stated by the
authors is to ‘‘curtail the act of ‘finning’
sharks while reducing the U.S. contribution
to the global shark fin market.’’ The prac-
tice of shark finning is already illegal in the
United States and Louisiana and has been
since the 2000s. All sharks landed in Lou-
isiana must have their fins naturally at-
tached until landed. Once a shark is landed
in Louisiana, these fins may then be re-
moved and processed separately.
Information available on NOAA’s National
Marine Fisheries Service commercial statis-
tics website shows that in 2015, 17,059 kilo-
grams (37,530 pounds) of shark fins were ex-
ported from the United States to other coun-
tries while 24,016 kilograms (52,835 pounds) of
shark fins were imported from other coun-
tries. The total estimated global shark fin
trade, was an estimated 17,500 metric tons
(according to a 2015 F.A.O. report on the
state of the global market for shark prod-
ucts). These U.S. total imports and exports
amount to less than 1% of shark fins traded
globally. This bill will likely have little im-
pact on the global trade in shark fins, espe-
cially the illegal trade of shark fins. The ma-
jority of shark fin exports do not move
through the United States. The majority of
fins exported from the United States, in the
past, moved through California to the Hong
Kong Market. However, since the California
ban on shark fins in 2015, the shark fin trade
now mainly flows through Mexico and Can-
ada in North America. These bills will do lit-
tle to reduce global trade or curtail illegal
practices on the high seas, but will economi-
cally impact responsible U.S. fishermen.
Data for 2016 were not yet available.
Sharks are indeed a vital part of the ma-
rine ecosystem, however those sharks har-
vested in the United States, along with their
fins, are sustainably harvested in accordance
with regulations and quotas established by
the NOAA Fisheries Highly Migratory Spe-
cies Division and the State of Louisiana. By
eliminating a domestic market for legally
harvested fins, this legislation will only have
adverse impacts on Louisiana fishermen who
legally harvest sharks and their fins as well
as the coastal fishing communities where
they live. These bills will create unnecessary
regulatory waste of legally harvested shark
parts by not allowing fishermen to sell fins
from a legally harvestable shark species.
These bills ban one part, the most valuable
part, of an otherwise legally harvestable ani-
mal creating a situation in which an entire
fishery would effectively be shut down. They
will either not affect global shark fin mar-
kets, or at worst, will encourage further de-
velopment of unregulated harvest to replace
the regulated US landings.
The shark fishery is an important winter
fishery in Louisiana as it provides a critical
seasonal source of income to a number of
commercial fishermen until other fisheries
open later in the year.
Possible alternative measures to allow the
legal shark fishery of the U.S. to continue to
harvest and sell legally obtained fins while
working to reduce illegal finning practices:
1) Legislation mandating tracking and
traceability of legally harvested fins as op-
posed to an outright ban.
2) Provide for tracking and traceability
measures of imported and exported fins to
determine legal origin of those fins origi-
nating from or entering into the U.S.
3) Prohibit the importation or exportation
of shark fins that can’t be verified to have
come from legally landed sharks.
Sincerely,
JACK MONTOUCET,
Secretary.
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. They say:
‘‘As long as responsible management is
in place, which is currently the case for
sharks in the Gulf of Mexico, there is
no need for this legislation.’’
They say: ‘‘The practice of shark fin-
ning is already illegal in the United
States and Louisiana and has been
since the 2000s.’’
‘‘These bills will create unnecessary
regulatory waste of legally harvested
shark parts by not allowing fishermen
to sell fins from a legally harvestable
shark species.’’
These bills ‘‘will either not affect
global shark fin markets, or at worst,
will encourage further development of
unregulated harvest to replace the reg-
ulated U.S. landings.’’
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD
a National Geographic article from this
year that has quotes from the Mote
Marine Laboratory in Florida.
SHARK FIN IS BANNED IN 12 U.S. STATES—BUT
IT’S STILL ON THE MENU
SHARK FIN BANS, INTENDED TO REDUCE IN-
STANCES OF SHARK FINNING, ARE DIFFICULT
TO ENFORCE, LEADING SOME TO QUESTION IF
THEY’RE WORTH IT
(By Rachel Fobar, Jan. 16, 2019)
But that would be against state law. Cali-
fornia is one of 12 states that bans the sale
of shark fins—measures to help prevent fur-
ther declines of shark populations and to
deter finning, which has been illegal in U.S.
waters since 2000. Although demand for
shark fins for soup is greatest in Asian coun-
tries, there’s significant demand for them in
the United States too.
A man who identified himself as the China
Gate Restaurant owner’s brother says the
online listing is a mistake and denies that
the restaurant serves the dish.
Finning involves slicing fins off live sharks
and tossing the wounded animals overboard,
where they sink to the bottom and, unable
to swim and pass water over their gills, suf-
focate, die of blood loss, or get eaten by
other predators.
‘‘It’s without doubt, the worst act of ani-
mal cruelty I’ve ever seen,’’ says celebrity
chef Gordon Ramsay in his television docu-
mentary on the shark fishing industry.
Every year, the Animal Welfare Institute,
a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that sup-
ports a national ban on shark fin, updates its
list of restaurants that serve shark fin soup
and notifies the relevant state enforcement
agencies.
But so far, according to the institute, the
bans haven’t stopped restaurants in at least
10 of the 12 states.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9080 November 20, 2019
During the past two years, at least five
bills relating to the country’s shark fin trade
have been introduced in the U.S. House of
Representatives and the Senate. All five died
before becoming laws, leaving the fate of
sharks in the U.S. uncertain.
Many countries don’t regulate shark fin-
ning, says Peter Knights, CEO of WildAid, an
environmental group that strives to reduce
consumption of wildlife products. What this
means, activists say, is that Americans
could be getting their fins from countries
that catch and mutilate sharks, diminishing
their already dwindling global populations.
Because of overfishing and the demand for
shark fin for soup, more than a quarter of
the world’s sharks, rays, and chimaeras (a
cartilaginous fish also known as ghost
sharks) are considered to be threatened. In a
2012 study, researchers found the DNA of
eight different sharks, including the endan-
gered scalloped hammerhead, as well as vul-
nerable species like the shortfin mako and
the spiny dogfish, in soup samples collected
from around the U.S.
Shark fin soup has long been a status dish
in Asian countries, notably China, where its
use can be traced back to an emperor from
the Song Dynasty (960–1279) who is thought
to have invented the dish to show off his
power and wealth. Shark fin eventually be-
came exalted as one of the four treasures of
Chinese cuisine, along with abalone, sea cu-
cumber, and fish maw (swim bladders).
Today, it’s a luxury dish served at wed-
dings as a sign of respect for guests. Prepara-
tion of the soup involves boiling the fins and
scraping off the skin and meat, leaving be-
hind softened protein fiber, which is some-
times shredded before it goes into the soup.
What is a luxury to some is a headache to
understaffed enforcement agencies in the
U.S. states that ban shark fin. They say that
cases against shark fin vendors in those
states can be hard to make. Because the
shark fin trade tends to go underground, it
has been compared to the illicit drug trade.
‘‘I know it’s going on, I know it’s out
there,’’ says San Francisco marine warden
William O’Brien. ‘‘But it’s a very private
matter—it’s not the kind of thing that, you
know, people are selling to the public.’’
In addition, according to several law en-
forcement agents, fines and jail sentences for
violating the shark fin ban are generally
light and have little deterrent effect.
Knights says a U.S. ban on sales of shark
fin would be a significant step forward be-
cause it would send the message that selling
and consuming shark fin isn’t acceptable
anymore. The sale of shark fin, he says,
‘‘continues to increase the sort of pressure
on sharks worldwide.’’
But, argues Robert Hueter, director of the
Center for Shark Research at Mote Marine
Laboratory, in Sarasota, Florida, given how
difficult it is for some states to enforce their
shark fin bans, a nationwide ban would just
drive the shark fin market underground—as
it’s done in San Francisco.
California has about a third of the coun-
try’s Asian population and is one of the larg-
est consumers of shark fin outside Asia.
When the shark fin ban passed in Cali-
fornia in 2011, San Francisco marine warden
William O’Brien says he was ‘‘charged up.’’
He’d been keeping a list of restaurants to in-
spect once the ban went into force.
Almost immediately, he and his team re-
ceived a tip about a supplier, and they con-
fiscated more than 2,000 pounds of shark fin
from a warehouse near San Francisco Bay.
He estimates that the haul was worth at
least $500,000. The accused, Michael Kwong, a
shark fin wholesaler and vocal opponent of
the shark fin ban who said his family had
been in the business for four generations,
pleaded no contest to violating the shark fin
ban. According to court records, he spent 30
days in jail, paid a court fine, and received
three years’ probation.
Since then, O’Brien says, the leads have
dried up. He suspects restaurants and mar-
ket owners are now storing their shark fin
supplies off premises—perhaps in their
homes, which would be off-limits to law en-
forcement without a search warrant.
‘‘Essentially, the market has gone so far
underground that it requires more speciali-
zation than I have to dig it up,’’ O’Brien
says.
O’Brien’s overall responsibilities include
monitoring for illegal ivory, the pet trade,
and illegal animal products in medication,
and he must also check hunting and fishing
licenses almost daily. He reckons that in any
given month, he’s able to devote only about
two days to shark fin.
‘‘It would be great if I was like, the shark
fin guy, and that was all I did,’’ O’Brien la-
ments.
A complicating factor is that a
restauranteur accused of selling shark fin
soup may claim it’s imitation or made from
a species of shark exempt from the ban.
Spiny and smooth dogfish sharks, for exam-
ple, are exempt in New York State. It’s pos-
sible to identify a species from a freshly cut
fin, but once a fin is dried or absorbed in
soup, the only way to prove it’s a species in
violation of the law is through DNA testing.
To ascertain whether a crime has been
committed, authorities must establish
whether the DNA in a seized sample of soup
is actually that of a shark. The specimens
Ashley Spicer tests and analyzes as a part of
her work in the Wildlife Forensics Lab at the
California Department of Fish and Wildlife
vary from suspected shark fin soup in plastic
to-go containers to frozen fins in vacuum-
sealed packaging.
Spicer examined California’s 2018 shark
cases—all four of them. Only two of those
cases were specifically shark fin; the others
were a shark attack case and a poaching
case. In all, the two shark fin cases she han-
dled in 2018 involved about 20 different shark
fins.
Low test numbers don’t necessarily rep-
resent every California shark fin case that
comes to the attention of authorities. If, for
example, a case elicits an immediate confes-
sion on the part of the accused, authorities
may decide that testing isn’t necessary.
DNA testing proved successful in a recent
case in Plano, Texas, one of the states where
shark fin is banned. Mike Stephens, a game
warden with the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department, went into a local dim sum res-
taurant—in uniform—with a colleague and
asked for the ‘‘special’’ menu. And there it
was: shark fin soup.
To assure them the shark fin was real, not
imitation, the restaurant owner’s wife led
the wardens to a walk-in freezer where they
found about six bags of shark fins. Stephens
assumes that the owner, Qi Zhou, and his
wife didn’t realize the real reason behind the
wardens’ visit until it was too late. Before
they left, Stephens says, Zhou’s wife told
them they weren’t the only ones selling
shark fin. The supermarket next door was of-
fering it too, she said.
Sure enough, when the wardens went to
the supermarket, Tao Marketplace, to inves-
tigate, they found nearly 40 shark carcasses,
the tail fins removed, on display in the fresh
fish aisle and in storage.
Wearing rubber gloves so as not to con-
taminate the evidence, they sealed the fins
from both places in separate containers and
overnighted them to a lab in North Carolina
for DNA testing.
The case against the supermarket is still
pending, but the restaurant owner was found
guilty of selling shark fin and paid a fine:
one dollar. The court also ordered Zhou to
make a donation to the Animal Welfare In-
stitute, which totaled less than a thousand
dollars, Stephens says.
According to the institute, in Texas and
most other states, prison sentences for shark
fin transgressions are rare and usually don’t
exceed six months for a first offense. Fines
are usually less than a thousand dollars. By
contrast, a single pound of dried shark fin
can sell for $400, and shark fin soup can com-
mand anywhere from $50 to $200.
‘‘It’s tough to get jail time on wildlife
cases,’’ says Jesse Paluch, a captain with the
New York State Department of Environ-
mental Conservation’s Bureau of Environ-
mental Crimes Investigation unit. In New
York, he says, judges and prosecutors ‘‘see so
much crime, so wildlife crime is a little bit
lower on the spectrum.’’
In October 1988, when Robert Hueter was
getting his start at the Mote Marine Labora-
tory, he heard from a colleague that a group
of fishermen off the Florida Panhandle had
been caught harpooning bottlenose dolphins,
whose meat and blood they used to bait
sharks. Killing bottlenose dolphins was and
still is illegal under the Marine Mammal
Protection Act of 1972. When the fishermen
caught sharks, they sliced off their fins and
threw the mutilated animals, still alive,
back into the water.
This is sick, Hueter says he thought at the
time. He’d never heard of shark finning, so
he contacted Nelson Bryant, a reporter he
knew at The New York Times, who wrote a
pioneering story about the practice. Today,
shark finning is the subject of documen-
taries, public protests, and Facebook posts.
Hueter says the fishermen were handed
minor fines for killing the dolphins—and no
penalty for finning the sharks. ‘‘There was
no crime in what they’d done with the
sharks,’’ he says.
Since then, Hueter has been an advocate
for sharks. Which is why, he says, he’s
against a national shark fin ban.
‘‘The folks that are pushing the fin ban
campaign want to simplify it to this very
simple message—that if we ban the fin trade
in the United States, we save sharks all
around the world,’’ Heuter says. ‘‘That is so
simplistic and so wrong.’’
He says that of course he’s against finning
and overfishing but that cutting the fins off
a legally caught dead shark isn’t cruel, and
banning a specific dish won’t stop shark fin-
ning because shark finning is already illegal
in U.S. waters. But, he says, a ban will en-
sure that fins from dead sharks are wasted.
‘‘It would cause [fishermen] to have to
throw the fins into the dumpster. It goes to-
tally against our doctrine of full utilization
of fishery products—that when we harvest
fishes from the sea, we don’t want to throw
stuff away. We want to use absolutely every-
thing we can.’’
David Shiffman, a marine conservation bi-
ologist with Simon Fraser University, in
Vancouver, Canada, and the man behind the
popular Twitter account @whysharksmatter,
says it’s unreasonable for people to criticize
using shark fins for soup when they may eat
shark meat in other forms.
‘‘There are people who are outraged at the
idea of consuming a bowl of shark fin soup
who are not outraged at the idea of eating a
mako shark steak on the grill,’’ he says.
‘‘From my perspective, as a shark conserva-
tion biologist, either way you’ve got a dead
shark. Shark fin soup has sort of become this
boogie man of ocean conservation.’’
As an alternative to a national ban, in 2018
Hueter helped draft the Sustainable Shark
Fisheries and Trade Act, which Representa-
tive DANIEL WEBSTER, a Florida Republican,
says he plans to reintroduce this session.
This bill, Hueter says, would allow imports

only from countries that prohibit finning
and promote shark conservation.
But Susan Millward, director of the marine
animal program at the Animal Welfare Insti-
tute, says a blanket ban is still the best an-
swer.
‘‘Even if you have a sustainable shark fin
trade, there’s still going to be a trade in
shark finning,’’ she says. ‘‘There’s always
going to be people who want to flout it.’’
Chinese basketball star Yao Ming pushes a
white ceramic cup of shark fin soup across a
table. In an aquarium tank to his right, a
bleeding computer-generated shark sinks to
the bottom. ‘‘Remember,’’ he says, staring
into the camera lens, ‘‘when the buying
stops, the killing can too.’’
Since 2011, consumption of shark fin soup
in China has fallen by about 80 percent, both
because of national bans on serving shark fin
at government banquets and the effect of ce-
lebrity-backed awareness campaigns such as
Yao Ming’s, seen by millions of Chinese.
According to a 2018 WildAid report, when
WildAid began its Chinese anti-shark fin
campaign in 2006, 75 percent of consumers
didn’t realize the soup they were eating was
made from shark, and many who did know
mistakenly thought that sharks’ fins grew
back after they were cut off.
Many conservationists believe that similar
awareness-raising efforts in the U.S. would
curb demand. People generally don’t give
much thought to what they’re eating,
Millward says. ‘‘It’s just a lack of connecting
the dots with where this product came from,
how it started with a live animal and how
much suffering was endured to reach this fin-
ished product . . . These animals are dying
painfully, and their whole ecosystems are
being affected—for what?’’
Her question begs another: Why shark fin?
It’s widely known that the fin adds no taste
or health benefits to shark fin soup; rather,
it gives the soup a crystalline, noodle-like
texture, which can be replicated almost in-
distinguishably with mung bean paste or
melon. What’s more, because shark fins are
cartilage and rigid protein fibers, they need
to be cooked for hours, even a full day, to
soften them enough to be edible. ‘‘If you
cook my belt for 24 hours, it would be edible
too,’’ Knights says.
Ironically, as conservationists, chefs, and
even consumers themselves acknowledge,
the flavor of shark fin soup—a dish that has
ignited international controversy, spurred
people to write countless letters to the
United States Congress, and led to a massive
awareness campaign—comes not from the
fins but from the chicken broth used as the
soup’s base.
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. In fact,
the director of shark research for that
institute says, ‘‘The folks that are
pushing the fin ban campaign want to
simplify it to this very simple message
that if we ban the fin trade in the
United States, we save sharks all
around the world. That is so simplistic
and so wrong.
It would cause fishermen ‘‘to have to
throw fins into the dumpster. It goes
totally against our doctrine of full uti-
lization of fishery products, that when
we harvest fishes from the sea, we
don’t want to throw stuff away. We
want to use absolutely everything we
can.’’
David Shiffman, a marine conserva-
tion biologist with Simon Fraser Uni-
versity, also talks about how this is a
flawed approach. He lays out an alter-
native, which my friend from Florida,
Congressman WEBSTER, and the Mote
Marine Laboratory director of the
shark institute there have advocated
for as well.
Mr. Speaker, there is no one in this
body who supports the concept of shark
finning. But let’s be clear on that. No
one here supports this concept of fin-
ning a shark and just letting the rest
of it drop to the bottom and die. No
one does. But we have to understand
that our entire fisheries management
practice, the State of Louisiana having
one of the largest commercial fisheries
in the Nation, that this is part of the
overall consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
VEASEY). The time of the gentleman
has expired.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I
yield an additional 30 seconds to the
gentleman.
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. This is
part of the overall consideration. Yet
this bill attempts to gut legally sus-
tainable shark harvesting that is part
of the overall fisheries management
process and doesn’t take into consider-
ation what impact that will have.
In closing, this bill is not the right
approach. I agree with the objective,
but all we are doing here is pushing il-
legally harvested species to other
countries, as opposed to truly stopping
the problem. There are successful ef-
forts out there that are demonstrated
to work, whereas this simply, again,
promotes illegal harvesting.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, if this
is a question that requires us to listen
to the experts and the scientists about
how to end the global shark fin trade,
then it is not much of a debate, be-
cause over 150 scientists are on record
supporting this bill. The same con-
sensus exists among leaders at aquar-
iums, academic institutions, and other
places.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLU-
MENAUER).
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I
appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy
and his leadership and our friend from
the Northern Mariana Islands for mov-
ing this legislation forward.
This is about leadership in terms of
ending the global practice. My col-
league from Louisiana understates the
power that the United States has in
terms of getting our policies right. Yes,
we have outlawed shark finning in 2010,
but the international traffic continues,
and we need to take this next step.
This is a progression of efforts to try
to deal with animal welfare. This is one
of the first arguments we hear whether
it is illegal poaching, the ivory trade,
or other endangered species, we have
been able to set the table on a global
stage to be able to change the dynam-
ics, to change the economics, and to
change public perception.
Sharks are declining globally. There
may be a species or two here or there,
but, overall, this apex predator spe-
cies—so important for the health of the
ecosystem—is in peril, and the practice
of shark finning is part of this.
Mr. Speaker, you have heard about
de-finning while they are still alive and
discarding them back in the water
which is a very common practice. We
know that my State of Oregon is one
where people stepped up and ended this
barbaric practice. We have mobilized
voting initiatives where we deal with
problems of trafficking with exotic spe-
cies. It has proven that our action in
2010 prohibiting the taking of fins was
not enough as long as this global trade
continues unchecked. There still is a
market for the fins in the United
States and around the world, and it is
fueled by imports sourced from all over
the world, including locations with no
ban. We are one of the top 15 shark fin
importing nations.
Who knew?
As a result, it is highly likely that
shark fins sold in the United States
came from sharks that have been bru-
tally finned.
I am pleased that we are taking ac-
tion to do the right thing and ban the
trade of shark fins. I hope the Senate
takes this bill up quickly and passes it
so we can get it enacted into law. This
is one of the things we could actually
agree with. Mr. Speaker, you have
heard the bipartisan support evidenced
here today.
But I hope that we can continue for-
ward with an animal welfare agenda.
There is a series of bills on a bipartisan
basis, for example, the PREPARED
Act, to help animals during natural
disasters, the Wildlife Conservation
and Anti-Trafficking Act to combat
wildlife trafficking, and the SAFE Act
to prevent horse slaughter.
We have these bipartisan pieces of
legislation with major sources of co-
sponsors. They are teed up and ready to
go. I hope this passes today with over-
whelming support, and it is one more
step as we implement an animal wel-
fare agenda that is one of the areas
where we can work together on a bipar-
tisan basis to make the world a little
better.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, we
hear a lot about the letter signed by
150 scientists in support of this bill. We
ought to point out that only 10 of those
150 scientists actually are scientists
with expertise in shark fisheries. But
every one of the scientists who signed
the Wildlife Conservation Society let-
ter in opposition to this bill is recog-
nized as an active professional shark
researcher and expert in the field.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the
gentleman from Florida (Mr. WEB-
STER).
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank Mr. MCCLINTOCK for yield-
ing.
I rise today in opposition to H.R. 737,
the Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act.
As a Floridian and member of the
House Natural Resources Committee,
promoting shark conservation has long
been a priority of mine. I am glad to
see sharks receiving national atten-
tion.

grave threat: shark finning, a cruel
practice of capturing sharks, clipping
their fins, and casting the rest of it to
a slow death in the ocean. This prac-
tice is cruel and inhumane.
I was a member of the legislature al-
most 30 years ago when Florida was
one of the first States to ban shark fin-
ning. Since then, finning has become
completely illegal in the United
States.
Unfortunately, finning still occurs in
unregulated waters around our globe.
H.R. 737 will do nothing to protect
sharks from being finned in those
areas. Instead, it would require Amer-
ican fishermen who legally and respon-
sibly land sharks to destroy or discard
their fins, leading to terrible waste.
Many scientists, conservationists,
and commercial fishermen have vo-
cally opposed this bill and have said it
will not advance shark restoration or
stop the practice of finning.
This bill would have a devastating ef-
fect on responsible American fisher-
men, including many in my own dis-
trict in Florida who have made sac-
rifices to conserve and rebuild our
shark populations.
I offer a separate bill, an alternative,
H.R. 788, one that has been sponsored
and supported by Senator RUBIO in the
Senate and is probably the key bill
there for this particular issue. Instead
of banning the sale of humanely
sourced shark fins, my bill would en-
courage bad actors in the shark fin
market to create science-based man-
agement systems for shark conserva-
tion.
b 1430
My bill requires any nation seeking
to export shark, ray, or skate to the
United States to first be certified by
NOAA that it has conservation policies
in place that rise to the standards of
U.S. fishermen and that forbid nations
to practice shark finning.
The U.S. plays an important role on
the world stage in fishing management
and conservation. H.R. 737 would re-
move the U.S. from the shark fin mar-
ket; it would silence the leading voice
in shark conservation—my bill would
amplify it—and ensure no finned shark
fins enter into the United States.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
make the best choice for sustaining
shark populations long-term and op-
pose this deeply flawed bill before us
today.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. WEBSTER
for his engagement on this issue. I
think his intentions are noble. I think
he wants to help end the global shark
fin trade. Unfortunately, though, his
bill just won’t work.
We did incorporate some of that bill,
the part, frankly, that would not cost a
lot of money. By doing so, we added
skates and rays to the seafood import
monitoring program. That is a good
suggestion, because skates and rays are
also not doing well globally, and they
deserve our attention.
But the rest of the bill is expensive,
cumbersome, and, frankly, it is just
not going to work. It would require a
complicated, expensive certification
scheme that might sound good on
paper, but we know the real world that
we live in.
In the marine fisheries management
in the United States right now, we are
years, and sometimes decades, behind
having the resources we need for ade-
quate and timely stock assessments,
even for the fisheries that we are al-
ready trying to manage right now.
So the idea that we would somehow
be able to do this, be able to afford it,
and also do it in a way that we could
comply with in this country so we
could hold other countries around the
world to that standard, if we are un-
able to do all of that stuff, then requir-
ing other countries to meet that stand-
ard would trigger a WTO violation and
we would do nothing to help end the
global shark fin trade.
Again, I appreciate the gentleman’s
interest in this issue. I know that Flor-
ida has been said to be the heart of the
opposition to this bill, but we should
note that 19 members of the Florida
delegation support this bill, including 6
Republicans in the Florida delegation.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, let’s be very clear: Kill-
ing a shark for its fin while throwing
away the rest of the carcass is con-
temptible; it is immoral; it is wrong;
and it has been illegal and banned in
the United States since 1993. American
fishermen don’t do this. American fish-
ermen are the good guys in this story.
This bill does something very dif-
ferent. It requires American fishermen
to throw away the fins when they kill
a shark. That is just as wasteful, just
as despicable, and it is not going to
stop foreign bad actors. It will kill
American fishing. It will destroy the
livelihoods of Americans who have fol-
lowed the law and who are responsibly
accounting for their entire catch. It is
not going to help our domestic shark
populations. They are doing quite fine.
NOAA currently manages 42 shark
species, along with the commercial and
recreational shark fisheries. None of
these 42 species in the Atlantic are list-
ed as endangered under the Endangered
Species Act. As I pointed out earlier,
the most recent results of the NOAA
fisheries’ longest running shark survey
show our domestic populations increas-
ing, with scientists capturing and tag-
ging more than ever before.
It is a shame that we are here to
blame American fishermen, who are
following all of the laws and doing ev-
erything right.
And remember this: Under H.R. 737,
sharks can still be legally caught in
U.S. waters; however, they will be
forced to cut off the fins and throw
them into the garbage. Ask yourself: Is
this right?
Congress has long supported the full
utilization of landed seafood in order to
obtain the maximum economic value of
our limited marine resources, all con-
sistent with the Magnuson-Stevens
Act. This legislation will result in lit-
tle more than wasted resources.
The administration opposes this leg-
islation. It writes:
We cannot support the Shark Fin Sale
Elimination Act because of the bill’s nega-
tive impact on U.S. fishermen that would
outweigh its minimal benefit to shark con-
servation. This would hurt U.S. fishermen
who currently harvest and sell sharks and
shark fins in a sustainable manner under
strict Federal management.
Industry opposes this legislation.
They write:
H.R. 737 would effectively put an end to all
shark fishing. The revenue realized from fin
sales can comprise up to 50 percent of a large
coastal shark’s value. Requiring the discard
or destruction of shark fins is also wasteful,
both as a food resource and an economic re-
source that helps sustain rural coastal fish-
ing communities here in America. It has
long been the policy of Congress to encour-
age full utilization of land and catch in order
to obtain the maximum economic value of
our limited marine resources.
And, finally, scientists oppose this
legislation. Two of the leading sci-
entists in the field write:
If the shark fin trade in the United States
were completely eliminated, the direct im-
pact on reducing global shark mortality
would likely be insignificant. The elimi-
nation of United States-supplied fins in
world markets would open the door to in-
creased market share for illegal, unreported,
and unregulated fishing nations not prac-
ticing sustainable shark fishing, including
those that have not yet prohibited finning.
This legislation follows a familiar
theme we hear from the other side:
Blame Americans first for the world’s
problems. This legislation is the defini-
tion of a solution in search of a prob-
lem.
I am sorry that some of my Repub-
lican colleagues have been convinced
to support this legislation, but I hope
that today’s debate has shined a bit of
truth on the issue.
Let me just quote from the humane
society quickly. Their reasoning for
this legislation is that: ‘‘The United
States has a robust market for shark
fins, many of which likely were ob-
tained through finning.’’
Let me state again, ‘‘likely were ob-
tained.’’ This is the science and data
that we are using to support this legis-
lation, ‘‘likely were obtained.’’ Mind
you, we make up less than 1 percent of
the global market.
Shark finning will continue across
the rest of the globe, and it will con-
tinue to focus on the market in South
and Southeast Asia. We will have lost
our ability to have managed our re-
sources and support our local fishing
industries.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to
oppose this misguided and mis-
conceived legislation, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, again, I agree with my
friend: We should listen to the sci-
entists—not the two who my friend

cited in his closing arguments, but how
about the over 150 who are on record in
support of this bill? We should listen to
them.
We should listen to the many States
and territories and other nations, in-
cluding, recently, Canada, our neighbor
to the north.
We should listen to the many cor-
porate leaders around the world, all of
whom have reached the inevitable con-
clusion that, if you are serious about
ending this wasteful and inhumane and
horrific practice of shark finning, then
you have to tackle the shark fin trade;
you have to ban the possession and sale
of shark fins, because, if you don’t, we
know here in the United States we
have banned the practice of shark fin-
ning for years, and yet we have contin-
ued to be part of and contributed to the
global shark fin trade because we don’t
ban the possession and trade and sale
of the fin itself.
That is what this bill does.
And in terms of U.S. fishermen who
are, as my friend says, following the
laws and doing everything right, well,
the good news is they are going to be
just fine under this law. We know that
because, in States like California, Or-
egon, Texas, and other places, folks
who want to continue fishing for shark
meat have been able to do so, even
though those States have passed bans
just like this on the possession, trade,
and sale of shark fins.
This is a good bill. It is an over-
whelmingly bipartisan bill. It is a bill
that includes support from 19 members
of the Florida delegation, including 6
Republicans from that delegation.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS

Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I move to
suspend the rules and pass the bill
(H.R. 925) to extend the authorization
of appropriations for allocation to
carry out approved wetlands conserva-
tion projects under the North Amer-
ican Wetlands Conservation Act
through fiscal year 2024.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The text of the bill is as follows:
H.R. 295
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘North Amer-
ican Wetlands Conservation Extension Act’’.
SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.
Section 7(c) of the North American Wet-
lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 4406(c)) is
amended by striking ‘‘not to exceed—’’ and
all that follows through paragraph (5) and in-
serting ‘‘not to exceed $60,000,000 for each of
fiscal years 2020 through 2024.’’.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from the
Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. SABLAN)
and the gentleman from California (Mr.
MCCLINTOCK) each will control 20 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from the Northern Mariana Islands.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from the Northern Mariana Is-
lands?
There was no objection.
Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, this bill would reau-
thorize the North American Wetlands
Conservation Act, a partnership-based
program that leverages non-Federal
funds to protect and restore wetland
and associated habitat.
NAWCA has enjoyed bipartisan sup-
port in the past, and this bill is no ex-
ception.
The bill authorizes NAWCA for 5
years at $60 million per year.
NAWCA is considered one of the most
cost-effective conservation programs.
Each Federal dollar invested in
NAWCA is typically matched by more
than $3 from non-Federal partners at
the local and State level, including
corporations, private landowners, and
nonprofits.
Thanks to NAWCA, almost 29.8 mil-
lion acres of habitat have been pro-
tected.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 925 reauthorizes
conservation projects under the North
American Wetlands Conservation Act,
NAWCA, through fiscal year 2024.
I readily concede this is a popular
program. Even without an authoriza-
tion, the appropriators put $42 million
into this last year. The sponsors of the
bill, obviously, want more, authorizing
$60 million a year. That is higher than
any appropriation to date. I am con-
cerned that, in a time where we are
running record and perilous deficits, we
ought to consider the level which some
of these programs should be funded.
Much of the money under NAWCA is
used to obtain conservation easements
and wetlands outright to benefit mi-
gratory birds and fish. According to
the Fish and Wildlife Service, the pro-
gram has benefited almost 30 million
acres of wetland habitat in North
America since its inception 30 years
ago. It is a very good thing.
Here is the problem, though: The
Federal Government is already land-
lord to 640 million acres of the country
and is doing a poor job of maintaining
what we already have. For example,
the National Park Service is facing a
nearly $12 billion deferred maintenance
backlog. The question I would raise
today is whether we really need to au-
thorize increased funding to buy even
more land.
b 1445
It would be one thing if Congress had
taken strong action to address this
backlog by moving H.R. 1225 by Con-
gressman ROB BISHOP, the former
chairman and currently ranking mem-
ber of the Natural Resources Com-
mittee.
That was a favorably reported bill. It
has overwhelming support with 329 bi-
partisan cosponsors. That bill would
take excess funds from new energy de-
velopment and target these deterio-
rating lands so that people as well as
migratory birds and fish can enjoy
them.
I recognize that H.R. 925 simply au-
thorizes an existing program, but it is
imperative to take into account the re-
alities that our current Federal lands
are facing. Acquiring more land when
we can’t take care of the land we al-
ready control is not a wise use of our
resources.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. THOMPSON), who is the
sponsor of the bill.
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for
yielding and I rise in strong support of
my bill, H.R. 925, the North American
Wetlands Conservation Extension Act.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my col-
league, Congressman WITTMAN from
Virginia, for coauthoring this measure
with me and for his leadership on this
issue; not just on this bill, but on this
issue. He is a stalwart supporter and he
works extremely hard on making sure
our wetlands and environment are pro-
tected.
As members of the Migratory Bird
Conservation Commission, Congress-
man WITTMAN and I have the privilege
of evaluating and approving NAWCA-
funded projects in the United States, in
Canada, and in Mexico.
On that commission, we share a re-
sponsibility to ensure that everyone in
America can use and can enjoy the nat-
ural resources that belong to all of us.
Since 1989, North American Wetlands
Conservation Act grants have funded
close to 3,000 projects, carried out by
more than 6,000 partners. Every year,
restoration and conservation projects
funded by NAWCA support 7,500 jobs
across our country, from fisheries bi-
ologists and engineers, to construction
teams and supply retailers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9084 November 20, 2019
Federal NAWCA grants require a 10-
to-1 nonFederal match, and over the
past 30 years, $1.6 billion in Federal
funding has been matched more than 3
to 1 with $4.7 billion contributed by
nonFederal partners.
The result so far has been 29.8 million
acres, an area the size of the State of
Pennsylvania, of rehabilitated and re-
stored wetlands. These wetlands sup-
port ecological health and biodiversity
while providing outstanding opportuni-
ties for Americans to hunt, to fish, to
hike, to bird watch, to farm, and to
ranch. The resulting economic activity
exceeds $5 billion every year.
Even those who don’t use these lands
directly benefit. Wetlands provide nat-
ural processes that allow us to have
clean, plentiful water supplies. Wet-
lands protect the lands around them by
absorbing flood water and storm
surges.
H.R. 925 reauthorizes NAWCA so we
can continue the critical work on
North America’s wetlands that offer
tremendous ecological and economic
benefits to each and every one of us.
Mr. Speaker, I ask Members to sup-
port NAWCA today to make sure that
we continue to conserve our public
land. Let’s work together today on be-
half of all Americans, now and for fu-
ture generations.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I
yield such time as he may consume to
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.
WITTMAN).
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
also in strong support of H.R. 925, the
North American Wetlands Conserva-
tion Extension Act. And I would also
like to thank Mr. THOMPSON for his ex-
traordinary leadership on this legisla-
tion and for his service on the Migra-
tory Bird Conservation Commission.
As he spoke about, he has a passion
to make sure that we are preserving
that habitat we all value and the wild-
life that lives there—not just the mi-
gratory birds, but all of the other life
that it supports. It is critically impor-
tant that we continue this program. It
is one of the truly successful stories in
conservation in our Nation, and, again,
I want to thank Mr. THOMPSON for his
leadership.
This bill works to reduce wetlands
disappearance and to conserve migra-
tory bird habitat. The good part about
it is that we, in setting aside this land
now, predominantly use conservation
easements as a mechanism to do that.
I understand the chairman’s concern
about more acres of land in the Federal
inventory and the dollars that it takes
to maintain that land. We absolutely
have to address that. But the good
news here is that many of these acres
are in conservation easements, which
means they stay in private ownership.
They just have an easement from the
Federal Government to maintain that
critical habitat.
That really is the best of both worlds
as well as leveraging private dollars
with this. What a great example of how
to leverage public dollars with private
dollars.
Several years ago, the duck hunters,
en masse, came and said: Listen, we
want to increase the duck stamp fee so
that we can make sure we have the
necessary dollars to match the Federal
dollars that go into this program. It
was extraordinarily successful.
People who enjoy the resources, from
bird watchers to hunters and others,
have said: We want to put more of our
dollars into it. And, again, we are using
their tax dollars to leverage those pri-
vate dollars for this critical habitat.
Our wetlands across the United
States are Mother Nature’s filter for
the water that comes off the land and
also Mother Nature’s nurseries for all
that critical wildlife that lives there,
both fish, and birds, and other critters
that are critical to these environ-
ments. They are disappearing at an
alarming rate. This bill helps us stem
the loss of those wetlands.
As I have said, the leveraging of pri-
vate resources is critical. I think Con-
gress should be doing more to identify
these types of Federal programs like
NAWCA that have proven to be suc-
cessful. NAWCA matches funding that
then contributes to conservation suc-
cess in our communities. Let’s do more
of that.
Protecting and restoring and man-
aging wetland habitats is critically im-
portant. I would argue, of all of the
habitats out there, this habitat, on the
scale of value, has the most value
across, not just the United States, but
across the planet. We have to do more
to make sure we are preserving that.
It is critical that we invest effi-
ciently to conserve these areas. Invest-
ing efficiently means leveraging that
one public dollar to three private dol-
lars, and we want to make sure that we
are preserving these areas for use for
future generations.
Unfortunately, wetlands continue to
disappear at an alarming rate. This
helps stem the disappearance of those
wetlands.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to
support this legislation.
Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I would
like to commend Representative
THOMPSON and Representative WITT-
MAN for their work on this bill.
Mr. Speaker, I have no further re-
quests for time, and would inquire
whether my colleague has any remain-
ing speakers on his side. I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Mr. Speaker, this is, undoubtedly, a
popular program. It does well serve
public recreation and use, the very pur-
pose of our public lands, and I certainly
don’t oppose it.
But I do want to close with this
warning: We are continuing to acquire
more and more land while we are fail-
ing to take care of the enormous es-
tates that we already hold.
LOUIE GOHMERT, my colleague on the
Natural Resources Committee, has
compared our Federal lands policy to
the old miser in town whose mansion is
dilapidated, whose yard is overgrown
with weeds, and whose paint is peeling
because he spends all of his time and
money plotting how he is going to ac-
quire his neighbor’s property.
I would like to hope that the bipar-
tisan support for this bill will be ac-
companied soon with bipartisan sup-
port for Mr. BISHOP’s bill, H.R. 1225,
which would actually take the re-
sources that we are generating from
the public lands to assure that we are
taking proper care of our public lands.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I urge a
‘‘yes’’ vote on this bill, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
PAYNE). The question is on the motion
offered by the gentleman from the
Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. SABLAN)
that the House suspend the rules and
pass the bill, H.R. 925.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the mat-
ter under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield

Mr. Speaker, this bill introduced by
Representative MARSHALL would honor
the heroism of the soldiers of the U.S.
Army’s 1st Infantry Division by au-
thorizing the installation of additional
plaques at the First Infantry Division
Monument located in the National
Park Services’ President’s Park just
south of the White House.
These additions would include the
names of over 600 1st Infantry Division
soldiers who paid the ultimate sacrifice
in service to our Nation during Oper-
ation Desert Storm, Operation Endur-
ing Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom,
and Operation New Dawn, ensuring
that these fallen soldiers are not for-
gotten.
For over 100 years now, soldiers of
the U.S. Army’s 1st Infantry Division
have embodied their motto: ‘‘No mis-
sion too difficult, no sacrifice too
great. Duty first.’’
I am proud to rise in strong support
of this bill and the brave soldiers of the
1st Infantry Division and I want to
thank Representative MARSHALL for
championing this important legisla-
tion.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support it, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1088 offered by our
colleague from Kansas, Dr. ROGER
MARSHALL, authorizes the Society of
the 1st Infantry Division to modify the
First Infantry Division Monument here
in Washington, D.C.
This society seeks to honor its mem-
bers who died during combat in Oper-
ation Desert Storm, Operation Iraqi
Freedom, Operation New Dawn, and
Operation Enduring Freedom.
The 1st Infantry Division of the
United States Army has served our
country faithfully with distinction and
honor for well over a century now.
12,949 heroes of the ‘‘Big Red One’’ have
fallen in the defense of our Constitu-
tion and the freedoms it guarantees. A
grateful Nation remembers their names
by inscribing them on a monument
here in our Nation’s Capital.
Every one of them has been faithful
to the Division’s motto of: ‘‘No mission
too difficult, no sacrifice too great.
Duty first.’’
It is time to update and add names to
the monument to honor these Amer-
ican heroes and to serve as an inspira-
tion and example to the generation
whose freedom and security they gave
their lives to protect.
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the
measure, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am
prepared to close, so I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I
yield such time as he may consume to
the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MAR-
SHALL), the author of this bill.
b 1500
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I
thank my colleague from California
(Mr. MCCLINTOCK) for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today humbled
and a bit emotional in support of the
First Infantry Recognition of Sacrifice
in Theater Act, also known as the
FIRST Act.
The FIRST Act modifies the First In-
fantry Division Monument to include
and honor the names of 660 brave sol-
diers who paid the ultimate sacrifice
for our country during Operation Iraqi
Freedom, Operation New Dawn, and
Operation Enduring Freedom.
The First Infantry Division Monu-
ment, located in President’s Park, west
of the White House, was first conceived
by the Society of the 1st Infantry Divi-
sion to commemorate the lives of sol-
diers killed serving our country during
World War I. Over the years, a total of
12,949 names of fallen soldiers have
been inscribed and commemorated on
this monument, but it will now take an
act of Congress to honor the sacrifices
of those 660 recently fallen soldiers and
give their families a hallowed place for
remembrance.
Throughout history, when the Presi-
dent had decided to send troops into
harm’s way to protect American lives
and uphold American values, he has al-
most always called upon the 1st Infan-
try Division.
Indeed the 1st Infantry Division,
more commonly known as ‘‘The Big
Red One,’’ has a heroic and storied
past. Established in 1917, the Division
celebrated their 102nd anniversary ear-
lier this year, and since 1955, has called
Fort Riley, Kansas, its home.
Over the years, the soldiers of The
Big Red One have fought in World War
I, World War II, the Cold War, the Viet-
nam war, Operations Desert Shield and
Desert Storm, the Balkans peace-
keeping missions, the war on terror,
and as of today, multiple operations
around the globe.
Always first into battle, the Division
fired the very first American shots of
World War I, providing the United
States its first victory in the war to
end all wars at the Battle of Cantigny,
France.
Despite suffering more than 1,000 cas-
ualties, the 1st Infantry Division
bravely captured the village from Ger-
man forces, defended it against re-
peated counterattacks, and bolstered
the morale of the Allies. The Division
returned home in September 1919 with
5 medals of honor.
Next, in World War II, the 1st Infan-
try Division led the way during the Al-
lied invasion of North Africa, leading
to the defeat of the Axis Afrika Korps
and capturing over 250,000 soldiers.
The Division then departed for the
invasion of Sicily, after a specific re-
quest from Lieutenant General George
‘‘Old Blood and Guts’’ Patton. There
they faced fierce mountain combat and
suffered heavy casualties, with some
units losing over half their fighting
strength.
The 1st Infantry Division would then
return to England in preparation for
the Invasion of Normandy. On D-Day,
June 6, 1944, soldiers from The Big Red
One would once again lead the assault
on German forces in landings at Omaha
Beach. They would then go on to fight
a continuous offensive across France
and into Germany, suffering over 20,000
casualties throughout the war.
After the war, the 1st Infantry Divi-
sion provided protection for occupied
Germany and maintained security at
the Nuremberg trials. The Division
played a pivotal role in World War II
and would return home with 16 mem-
bers being awarded the Medal of Honor.
The 1st Infantry Division has been
active all over the world, assisting in
combat and humanitarian missions for
over 100 years. Since the Division’s es-
tablishment, more than 13,000 soldiers
of the 1st Infantry Division have lost
their lives in battle. Today, soldiers
from the Division stand at the ready in
over 15 countries. We sleep peacefully
here at home because they stand at the
ready abroad.
It is our duty as Members of Congress
to ensure these fallen soldiers are not
forgotten by passing the FIRST Act
and allowing the inclusion of the
names of these 660 fallen soldiers who
paid the ultimate sacrifice.
I am proud to represent them as they
continue to exemplify their motto: ‘‘No
mission too difficult, no sacrifice too
great. Duty first.’’
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I com-
mend Congressman MARSHALL for that
very moving presentation and for the
impressive history that he recounted of
the 1st Infantry Division.
This is a great bill, an important bill,
and I know we are all very proud to
support it. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from California (Mr.
HUFFMAN) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1088, as
amended.

MULTINATIONAL SPECIES CON-

STAMP REAUTHORIZATION ACT
OF 2019
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I move
to suspend the rules and pass the bill
(H.R. 1446) to require the United States
Postal Service to continue selling the
Multinational Species Conservation
Funds Semipostal Stamp until all re-
maining stamps are sold, and for other

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 2(c) of the Multi-

Semipostal Stamp Act of 2010 (39 U.S.C. 416
note; Public Law 111–241) is amended—
(1) in paragraph (2)—

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 1446. It is a bill that would re-
quire the U.S. Postal Service to con-
tinue selling the Multinational Species
Conservation Funds Semipostal Stamp.
It would require those continued sales
until such time as the remaining
stamps are sold.
Now, since 2010, these stamps have
been sold by the U.S. Postal Service to
support international conservation ef-
forts, but the authorization for these
sales has expired, leaving 49 million
stamps unsold—printed, but unsold.
Americans care deeply about wildlife,
and by purchasing these stamps, they
can support the Multinational Species
Conservation Fund, which includes five
grant programs that support the con-
servation of African and Asian ele-
phants, great apes, marine turtles,
rhinos and tigers.
Between 2011 and 2017, the stamp
sales from this program generated $3.9
million, and that money went to con-
servation projects related to
antipoaching, capacity building, com-
munity engagement and outreach,
habitat restoration, and raising public
awareness of wildlife trafficking.
Mr. Speaker, 49 million stamps have
already been printed. They are sitting
and waiting to be sold. This bill doesn’t
authorize the printing of any new
stamps, but it does direct the U.S.
Postal Service to continue selling the
stamps it has printed until they are ex-
hausted.
At a time when so many species are
threatened with extinction due to cli-
mate change, habitat loss, and exploi-
tation, we must do more to protect
wildlife.
Mr. Speaker, I do not have another
speaker at this point, and I reserve the
balance of my time.

DEAR CHAIRMAN GRIJALVA: I am writing to
you concerning the bill H.R. 1446, the Multi-
national Species Conservation Funds
Semipostal Stamp Reauthorization Act of
2019. There are certain provisions in the leg-
islation which fall within the Rule X juris-
diction of the Committee on Oversight and
Reform.
In the interest of permitting your com-
mittee to proceed expeditiously to consider-
ation of this important bill, I am willing to
waive this Committee’s right to consider the
bill. I do so with the understanding that by
waiving consideration of the bill, the Com-
mittee does not waive any future jurisdic-
tional claim over the subject matters con-
tained in the bill which fall within its Rule
X jurisdiction. I request that you urge the
Speaker to name members of this Committee
to any conference committee which is named
to consider such provisions.
Please place this letter into the committee
report on H.R. 1446 and into the Congres-
sional Record during consideration of the
measure on the House floor. Thank you for
the cooperative spirit in which you have
worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our respective committees.

Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. CLAY for
this legislation and for his being ame-
nable to changes that make this bill
one that every Member can support.
This legislation raises money
through the voluntary purchases of a
special stamp that in turn funds valu-
able conservation efforts of iconic glob-
al species such as tigers, elephants,
rhinos, great apes, marine turtles, and
their habitats.
Anyone who wants to help these ef-
forts can do so by purchasing these
stamps; a small surcharge for which is
then deposited in the Multinational
Species Conservation Funds. These
funds in turn provide grants for con-
servation work around the globe. To
date, over $5.7 million have been raised

by this low-key and entirely voluntary
effort.
While the authority to sell these pop-
ular stamps has expired, the stockpile
of 49 million stamps still exists. Mr.
CLAY accepted amendments to allow
the stockpile to be depleted before new
stamps are printed that prevents waste
and protects taxpayers.
International conservation of these
important species is a shared goal of
both Democrats and Republicans, and
this bill is a very good example of that
seemingly rare opportunity for all of us
to come together for the benefit of
wildlife, their habitat, and, of course,
the American people who enjoy both
for generations to come.
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the

National Monument of America near

H.R. 1472
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-

SECTION 1. HOMESTEAD NATIONAL HISTORICAL
PARK.
(a) IN GENERAL.—The first section of the
Act of March 19, 1936 (16 U.S.C. 450u), is
amended by striking ‘‘designated’’ and all
that follows through the end and inserting
‘‘designated the ‘Homestead National Histor-

(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law,
map, regulation, document, paper, or other

ant to the rule, the gentleman from
California (Mr. HUFFMAN) and the gen-

TOCK) each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that Members have
5 legislative days in which to revise
and extend their remarks and include
extraneous material on the measure
under consideration.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1472, introduced by
my friend Representative SMITH from
Nebraska, would rename the Home-
stead National Monument of America
near Beatrice, Nebraska, to the Home-
stead National Historical Park.
In 1862, President Lincoln signed the
Homestead Act, and this enabled citi-
zens to own a portion of the vast public
lands across the Western United
States.
To commemorate the first claim
under the Homestead Act, Congress es-
tablished the Homestead National
Monument of America in 1936; serving
as a lasting memorial to the over 1.6
million claims that built the American
West.
Today, the Homestead National
Monument of America consists of the
first site successfully claimed under
the Homestead Act, the Freeman
School, a heritage museum, hiking
trails, and 100 acres of restored tall
grass prairie. Redesignating this im-
portant monument as a national his-
torical park would provide a more ac-
curate and appropriate description of
the scope and complexity of the site’s
resources and would conform the
park’s designation to Park Service
standards.
Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my col-
league Representative SMITH for intro-
ducing this bill, and I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 1472. I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1472, offered by our
colleague, Congressman SMITH of Ne-
braska, would redesignate the Home-
stead National Monument of America
to simply the Homestead National His-
torical Park.
Congress authorized this commemo-
ration in 1936 after acquiring the site of
the Daniel Freeman homestead. It was
set aside as a lasting memorial to the
settlers who built the American West
as a result of the Homestead Act of 1862
and its successors.
In total, 207 million, or 10 percent, of
all land in the United States was set-
tled under the Homestead Act. The
name of the monument with the redun-
dant qualifier ‘‘of America’’ has made
it an anomaly within the National
Park system. This bill simply removes
that redundancy and conforms more
clearly with the naming customs of the
National Park Service.
Redesignating the unit as a national
historical park will further clarify the
unit’s characteristics in keeping with
the modern designations that the Park
Service maintains.
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the
measure, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from
Nebraska (Mr. SMITH), the author of
the measure who brings it to the floor
today.
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speak-
er, I certainly appreciate my col-
leagues and their support of our effort
to change the name from Homestead
National Monument of America to the
Homestead National Historical Park.
Obviously, some of the reasons have
been outlined.
I appreciate the chairman and rank-
ing member for bringing this legisla-
tion to the floor. It is supported by the
entire Nebraska delegation, and even
more importantly, by local stake-
holders.
And as was mentioned, the Home-
stead Act of 1862 was signed by Presi-
dent Lincoln, and it absolutely helped
shaped the American West. It allowed
U.S. citizens to earn ownership of a
portion of the vast public lands owned
by the Federal Government across the
Western U.S.
Ultimately, the Federal Government
granted title to 10 percent of the land
in the U.S. through this program. It
gave millions a chance to build a new
life for themselves, their families and
for future generations.
In order to claim a 160-acre parcel of

The Homestead Act remained in
place through 1976, with provisions al-
lowing for homesteading in Alaska
through 1986.
President Ronald Reagan said the
Homestead Act ‘‘ensured that the great
western prairies of America would be
the realm of independent, property-
owning citizens—a mightier guarantee
of freedom is difficult to imagine.’’
We are very proud that the very first
claim under the Homestead Act was
made by a man named Daniel Freeman,
near Beatrice, Nebraska, in Nebraska’s
Third District. To memorialize this
milestone, as well as the 1.6 million
other claims which built the American
West, the Homestead National Monu-
ment of America was established, also
near Beatrice.
Unfortunately, referring to this site
as a monument brings images of a sin-
gle, static monument, such as a statue,
an obelisk, or even a natural feature
like the Scotts Bluff National Monu-
ment near my hometown of Gering, Ne-
braska, not of an extensive park that
celebrates the pioneering homesteaders
of many years ago.

as the tallgrass prairie, hiking trails, a
forest, farming demonstrations, and
much more.
Referring to this site as a historical
park instead of a monument would far
more clearly describe the opportunities
to take in this living-history site. In
fact, according to the Friends of Home-
stead, 89 percent of first-time visitors
to the facility were confused by the
name.
On behalf of the people of Nebraska
and, particularly, the citizens of Bea-
trice and Gage County, Nebraska, I ap-
preciate this opportunity to advocate
in support of this proposal today.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I
yield the balance of my time to the
other gentleman from Nebraska (Mr.
FORTENBERRY).
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker,
first, let me thank two of my good
friends, Ranking Member MCCLINTOCK
and Chairman HUFFMAN, for the cordial
and elevated discussion today about
something that might appear small in
the big scheme of things, particularly
with what is going on in Congress, but,
nonetheless, is a good, working part of
functioning government on this House
floor.
This is important to us in Nebraska,
and it is important to the rest of Amer-
ica. I am pleased that my good friend,
Congressman ADRIAN SMITH, has been
working on this effort to rename the
Homestead National Monument of
America to the Homestead National
Historical Park to clear up some confu-
sion. This small but important change
will more accurately reflect the nature
and mission of this unique National
Park Service unit.
The Homestead Act of 1862, as we
have heard, really did forever change
the direction of our Nation. Let me
take us through a few facts that have
already been mentioned but I think
worthwhile emphasizing.
In exchange for the $18 filing fee and
just a commitment to improve the
land, any U.S. citizen could farm 160
acres and own it outright after 5 years.
Almost inconceivable to us today, but
that is how this began.
The National Park Service unit dedi-
cated to telling the extraordinary
story of these incredible pioneers is lo-
cated in Beatrice, Nebraska.
And I thank Chairman HUFFMAN for
clarifying how it is appropriately pro-
nounced: Beatrice, Nebraska.
Before redistricting earlier, I used to
represent this area. It is only about 50
minutes from my home in Lincoln, so
it is a part of the broad neighborhood
of the First and Third Congressional
Districts.
Homestead is located on the site of
one of the first homestead claims in
the United States, and it commemo-
rates the lives and accomplishments of
these early homesteaders. It also cele-
brates those hardy individuals who,
through harsh storms, brutal drought,
wind, snow, and isolation, actually
helped grow this country.
This minor name change will clear up
any confusion about this important
site because the word ‘‘monument’’
generally applies to a single individual
or a unique topographical feature.
Homestead is so much more. It is a
unique piece of open prairie, as we have
heard. It houses the historical records
of so many settlers, and many visitors
come looking to learn a little bit more
about their ancestors.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to particu-
larly recognize one individual, Mr.
Mark Engler, who is Homestead’s su-
perintendent and a friend of the Ne-
braska delegation who sees us quite a
lot, along with everyone else in the Be-
atrice community who have helped to
maintain Homestead as a gem of the
Midwest and a treasure for all Ameri-
cans.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, this is
a good bill. The community of Bea-
trice—I just had to say it one more
time because I like that pronuncia-
tion—is fortunate to be home to what
will hopefully soon be America’s new-
est historical park, the Homestead Na-
tional Historical Park, and is also for-
tunate to have been represented over
the years by these two fine gentlemen
from Nebraska.
Mr. Speaker, I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote on
this bipartisan bill, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from California (Mr.
HUFFMAN) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1472.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1487, introduced by
my colleague TED LIEU from California,
would direct the National Park Service

determine the suitability and feasi-
bility of designating a new national
recreation area along the Santa
Monica Bay coastline or incorporating
the area into the existing Santa
Monica Mountains National Recreation
Area.
Expanding the National Park Service
to include this area would significantly
enhance recreational and public lands
access in one of our Nation’s most con-
gested, polluted, and park-poor regions,
Los Angeles County.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9089
November 20, 2019
Although our public lands belong to
all Americans, many simply don’t have
the opportunity or the resources to
visit these incredible places. H.R. 1487
would help us take an important step
toward ensuring that public lands ac-
cess exists for all Americans, and I
thank my colleague Congressman LIEU
for championing this proposal.
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1487 authorizes a
special resource study of portions of
the Los Angeles coastal area in Cali-
fornia to evaluate alternatives for land
management, including designating
the coastal area as a unit of the Na-
tional Park System.
While I do not oppose authorizing a
special resource study of this area, I
hope that Congress will exercise cau-
tion before adding significant amounts
of coastline to the existing Santa
Monica Mountains National Recreation
Area, which is already struggling to
manage its current resources and is in-
creasingly beginning to resemble Lin-
coln’s story of a farmer who said, ‘‘I
ain’t greedy for land. I just want what
joins mine.’’
In 2018, because of bad land manage-
ment, the vast majority of this same
area burned in the massive Woolsey
fire. More than 21,000 of the 23,595 Na-
tional Park Service acres, about 88 per-
cent of the land, were burned. This in-
cluded most of the Western Town at
Paramount Ranch, the 1926 Peter
Strauss Ranch home, most of the joint
National Park Service/UCLA La Kretz
Research Center, two ranger resi-
dences, and an attached archives build-
ing.
Further, the National Park Service is
already stretched perilously thin and
facing a nearly $12 billion deferred
maintenance backlog that we discussed
in an earlier bill.
Although I recognize that this meas-
ure simply authorizes a study and
doesn’t transfer any land or jurisdic-
tion, it is imperative that we take into
account the realities that our parks
are facing and the devastating con-
sequences of a land management policy
that can only be described as benign
neglect. As we are discovering, the con-
sequences are anything but benign.
Mr. Speaker, with that caveat, I urge
adoption of the measure, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from California (Mr. TED
LIEU).
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr.
Speaker, I thank Congressman
HUFFMAN for his leadership and for sup-
porting this legislation, and I thank
Congressman MCCLINTOCK for sup-
porting this legislation.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support
of H.R. 1487, the Santa Monica Moun-
tains National Recreation Area Bound-
ary Adjustment Study Act.
In the 1970s, Congress established the
Santa Monica Mountains National
Recreation Area to preserve natural
and historic sites and to provide rec-
reational, educational, scientific, and
public health benefits to our greater
Los Angeles community.
Today, it spans more than 150,000
acres in Los Angeles and Ventura
Counties, including parts of the Santa
Monica Bay Watershed in my congres-
sional district. Much of the Santa
Monica Bay Watershed, however, re-
mains outside of the national recre-
ation area. This includes several miles
of beaches and acres of wetlands that
stand to benefit greatly from Federal
resources.
My bill would commission the Na-
tional Park Service to conduct a 3-year
special resource study to determine
whether to expand the boundary of the
existing Santa Monica Mountains Na-
tional Recreation Area or create a new
national recreation area altogether.
The study would cover the entire
Santa Monica Bay coastline, from Ven-
ice Beach to Torrance Beach, as well as
the Ballona Wetlands, Ballona Creek,
Baldwin Hills, and the San Pedro
coastline.
While conducting the study, the Na-
tional Park Service will consult with
State and local government groups,
community groups, nonprofits, and
residents.
The study would become a basis for
future congressional action to modify
the national recreation area borders.
Expanding the national recreation area
would allow the watershed to benefit
from available Federal, scientific, and
infrastructure resources, enabling bet-
ter conservation and recreational use.
It would also help Federal agencies
enter into cooperative agreements to
manage the land and carry out im-
provement projects aimed at con-
necting trails, building wildlife cor-
ridors, and more.
Importantly, all of this would be ac-
complished without affecting private
property rights or creating unfunded
mandates on State or local govern-
ments.
The Los Angeles coastal region
stands to benefit tremendously from
increased Federal resources to preserve
open space for conservation and recre-
ation, and I am proud to have the sup-
port of many of my colleagues in the
Los Angeles delegation. I urge my col-
leagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1487.
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I
would urge adoption of the measure
with the caveats I have already dis-
cussed, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I urge
an ‘‘aye’’ vote with no caveats, and I
thank the gentleman, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentleman from California (Mr.
HUFFMAN) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1487, as
amended.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill, as
amended, was passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

Hong Kong are of great importance to the
United States and are directly relevant to
United States interests in Hong Kong [and]
serve as a basis for Hong Kong’s continued

vision thereof, different from that accorded
the People’s Republic of China’’;

(4) to urge the Government of the People’s
Republic of China to uphold its commit-
ments to Hong Kong, including allowing the
people of Hong Kong to govern Hong Kong
with a high degree of autonomy and without
undue interference, and ensuring that Hong
Kong voters freely enjoy the right to elect
the Chief Executive and all members of the
Hong Kong Legislative Council by universal
suffrage;
(5) to support the establishment of a gen-
uine democratic option to freely and fairly
nominate and elect the Chief Executive of

cil;

SEC. 9. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON PEOPLE’S RE-

racy activists, diplomatic personnel of the
United States and other nations, and their
families by media organizations controlled
by the Government of the People’s Republic
of China, including Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung
Po;
(2) the Secretary of State should clearly
inform the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China that the use of media outlets
to spread disinformation or to intimidate
and threaten its perceived enemies in Hong
Kong or in other countries is unacceptable;
and
(3) the Secretary of State should take any
activities described in paragraph (1) or (2)
into consideration when granting visas for
travel and work in the United States to jour-
nalists from the People’s Republic of China
who are affiliated with any such media orga-
nizations.
SEC. 10. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON COMMERCIAL
EXPORTS OF CROWD CONTROL
EQUIPMENT TO HONG KONG.
It is sense of Congress that the Depart-
ment of Commerce, in conjunction with
other relevant Federal departments and
agencies, should consider appropriate adjust-
ments to the current United States export
controls with respect to Hong Kong to pre-
vent the supply of crowd control and surveil-
lance equipment that could be used inappro-
priately in Hong Kong.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
New York (Mr. ENGEL) and the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH)
each will control 20 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New York.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members have 5
legislative days in which to revise and
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on S. 1838.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, the passage of the Hong
Kong Human Rights and Democracy
Act today will once again demonstrate
our support for the people of Hong
Kong. The House passed our version of
the bill several weeks ago, and this
version passed the Senate last night as
well, demonstrating, without a doubt,
that the U.S. Congress stands with the
people of Hong Kong even during a par-
ticularly troubling time.
We are seeing the escalation of vio-
lence in unprecedented ways, indis-
criminate use of force against students,
and troubling reports of Chinese forces
directing and manipulating the secu-
rity forces in Hong Kong.
However, as Joshua Wong said when
he was last here with us on Capitol Hill
just a few weeks ago, the ‘‘people of
Hong Kong will never walk alone.’’
That is a quote. Never has this been
truer than today.
Although the abuses and injustices
that have been endured by the people
of Hong Kong are clear and evident to
everyone, the policy challenge that
this presents for the United States is
far more nuanced.
It is my expectation that, when im-
plementing this legislation, the Sec-
retary of State will understand con-
gressional intent that this legislation
is designed to help the U.S. Govern-
ment and the U.S. Congress better
evaluate the erosion of Hong Kong’s
autonomy and, ultimately, stem the
tide of China’s aggressive behavior to-
ward the people of Hong Kong.
Our objective is not to punish Hong
Kong, but to help preserve and protect
Hong Kong’s autonomy in the face of
Beijing’s flagrant disregard for ‘‘one
country, two systems,’’ which they had
promised. As such, we believe it is in
the national security interest of the
United States to protect the autonomy
of Hong Kong.
It is with that intent that this entire
legislative exercise has been under-
taken. I hope that in evaluating how to
apply the mandates in this bill, this ad-
ministration, and any future adminis-
tration, will give the best interest of
the people of Hong Kong the highest
consideration.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9093
November 20, 2019
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
First of all, I want to thank the dis-
tinguished chairman and the ranking
member, Mr. MCCAUL, for their strong
support for this effort, both bills that
are up today.
And I would also especially like to
thank the Speaker for her leadership as
well.
Mr. Speaker, since the 1989
Tiananmen Square massacre 30 years
ago, I have had the privilege of work-
ing with colleagues on both sides of the
aisle, including, and especially, Speak-
er PELOSI, JIM MCGOVERN, my good
friend—and he is the chairman of the
China Commission, and I am ranking
member—and Congressman Frank
Wolf, a former Member who was tena-
cious in his fight for human rights, the
rule of law, and democracy for the peo-
ple of China.
We have always believed that every
person deserves better than the bru-
tality so many endure in the system-
atic violations of their universally rec-
ognized human rights. China’s ruthless
dictators do not agree, and they are
driven—they are obsessed—to tighten
their control.
Today, Mr. Speaker, Hong Kong is
burning. The status quo is no longer.
The brutal government crackdown on
democracy activists has escalated.
Tragically, under President Xi Jinping,
human rights abuse throughout China
has significantly worsened, including
the pervasive use of torture, religious
persecution, human trafficking, and
genocide against Muslim Uighurs.
Last month, Mr. Speaker, President
Xi ominously warned of even more bru-
tal violence to come in Hong Kong,
threatening ‘‘crushed bodies and shat-
tered bones.’’
And the Hong Kong Government,
itself, prefers bullets and batons over
peaceful and political dialog that
would address the Hong Kong people’s
rightful grievances.
That is a sad and disgusting reality,
and it is what the Chinese Government,
however, does best: suppress, repress,
torture, kill, and censor.
With the passage of the Hong Kong
Human Rights and Democracy Act, the
United States Congress is making it
clear that beating, torturing, and
jailing democracy activists is abso-
lutely wrong. We stand in solidarity
with the people of Hong Kong. There
will be strong sanctions, other rami-
fications, for this crackdown, for this
abuse of power.
The people of Hong Kong have feared
for their freedom for a long time.
In 2014, Mr. Speaker, I met with Mar-
tin Lee and Anson Chan, two titans of
Hong Kong’s democracy movement.
They and Scott Flipse, of the China
Commission, and I met in my office for
hours as we discussed the Chinese Com-
munist Party’s growing influence and
their attempts that had already begun
to degrade autonomy and human rights
in Hong Kong.
That is, Mr. Speaker, the genesis of
this bill and our 5-year effort to push
back on Beijing’s pernicious inter-
ference in Hong Kong.
In the midst of the 2014 Umbrella
Movement, I first introduced, joined by
Speaker PELOSI, the first Hong Kong
Human Rights and Democracy Act. My
CECC co-chair, Senator BROWN of Ohio,
introduced the same bill in the Senate.
Over the years, in 2015 and 2017, Sen-
ator RUBIO and I upgraded the bill to
reflect the kidnapping of book sellers,
the disqualification of elected law-
makers, and the political prosecutions
of Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, Benny
Tai, and many others. However, every
time, every single time we pushed for
passage, there was vigorous opposition
from diplomats, so-called experts, com-
mittee chairs, and U.S. business inter-
ests in Hong Kong.
So passage of this legislation is long
overdue.
My House bill, cosponsored by the
gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.
MCGOVERN), my good friend and col-
league, and 46 other bipartisan cospon-
sors passed last month on October 15.
Today, we consider a final bill de-
rived from working with our colleagues
in the United States Senate. Specifi-
cally, the act directs the Secretary of
State to report and certify to Congress,
annually, whether Hong Kong con-
tinues to deserve special treatment
under U.S. law, different from Main-
land China, in such matters as trade,
customs, sanctions enforcement, law
enforcement cooperation, and protec-
tion of human rights and the rule of
law.
It directs the State Department not
to deny entry visas based primarily on
the applicant’s arrest or detention for
participating in nonviolent protest ac-
tivities in Hong Kong.
It requires, for the next 7 years, an
annual report from the Commerce De-
partment on whether Hong Kong Gov-
ernment adequately enforces U.S. ex-
port controls and sanctions laws, in-
cluding on those goods and services
transshipped to North Korea, Iran, or
other countries relating to the pro-
liferation of weapons of mass destruc-
tion, narcotics trafficking, and more.
It requires an assessment of whether
U.S. origin items, including software,
technology, and services, have been
transferred from Hong Kong to China
in violation of U.S. law and have been
used by China for mass surveillance,
predictive policing, or for the so-called
social credit system.
I know some Members might be won-
dering: What is the social credit sys-
tem? It is a ubiquitous, totalitarian,
‘‘brave new world’’ system scheduled
for implementation by 2020 that uses
public records, online activity, and
other tools of surveillance to aggregate
data on every Chinese citizen and busi-
ness and use that data to monitor,
shape, and rate financial, social, reli-
gious, or political behaviors.
The bill requires the President to
submit a strategy to Congress, to pro-
tect U.S. citizens and businesses in
Hong Kong from the erosion of auton-
omy and the rule of law because of ac-
tions taken by the Chinese Govern-
ment.
It requires the President to identify
and sanction persons in Hong Kong or
in Mainland China responsible for
extrajudicial rendition and gross viola-
tions of internationally recognized
human rights.
The Chinese Government warns us
repeatedly not to interfere in China’s
internal affairs, but the only inter-
ference we see is Beijing’s meddling in
the democratic freedoms of Hong Kong.
All I see and this body sees, my fellow
colleagues, is Beijing’s failure to honor
the promises made in the 1984 Sino-
British declaration, an international
treaty. All we see is Beijing’s failure to
honor the promises of Hong Kong’s
Basic Law.
We cannot avert our eyes to what is
happening in Hong Kong. We cannot si-
lence our voices when the rule of law,
democracy, human rights, free speech,
and autonomy are being threatened in
Hong Kong. We must remain steadfast
in support of the people of Hong Kong.
The whole world has a stake in a
peaceful and just resolution in Hong
Kong. The passage of the Hong Kong
Human Rights and Democracy Act is
an important signal that this Congress,
Democrat and Republican alike, House
and Senate, considers Hong Kong’s
freedoms and autonomy a critical in-
terest of the United States and the
international community.
In Hong Kong, they encourage each
other to keep pressing forward with the
phrase ‘‘Jia you.’’ So today, I say to
you, all of you in Hong Kong: ‘‘Jia
you.’’ Your cause is a noble, one and
you will not be forgotten.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), our Speaker of the
House, who has been very, very active
in Hong Kong freedom.
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the distinguished chairman for yield-
ing.
I salute him and Mr. MCCAUL, the
ranking member of the Foreign Affairs
Committee. To you, Mr. Chairman and
Mr. MCCAUL, thank you for affording
this opportunity to vote on the Hong
Kong Human Rights and Democracy
Act.
This is a proud day for the U.S. Con-
gress, for our values of freedom and
justice, and for the people of Hong
Kong.
For 6 months, the people of Hong
Kong have stirred the hearts of all free-
dom-loving people with their extraor-
dinary outpouring of courage and their
refusal to relinquish their demand for
democracy, the democratic freedoms,
and the rule of law which was promised
more than two decades ago.
Today, the Congress is sending an un-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9094 November 20, 2019
with the freedom-loving people of Hong
Kong, and we fully support their fight
for freedom.
We salute Chairman MCGOVERN, a
leading voice for human rights in
China and around the world, our Con-
gressional-Executive Commission on
China chair and also chair of the Tom
Lantos Human Rights Commission.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman
SMITH, just listening to him talk about
we are into our third generation of
freedom-loving people in Hong Kong.
I am so glad Mr. SMITH acknowledged
the work of our distinguished former
colleague, Frank Wolf, who was so, so
very much a part and still continues to
be a spiritual leader to us in this re-
gard.
We have worked with Martin Lee and
Anson Chan way back when and—so
late 1980s, early 1990s—then into this
new century with another generation;
and now, three generations, Martin Lee
still being involved, but with Joshua
Wong and Nathan Wong and all of the
young participants who are there, be-
cause it is a sad situation.
In 1997, when the United Kingdom
transferred Hong Kong to China, Amer-
ica was hopeful that the people of Hong
Kong would achieve the ‘‘high degree of
autonomy’’—that is in quotes—‘‘high
degree of autonomy’’ that they were
promised. Today, it is beyond question
that China has utterly broken that
promise.
America has been watching for years
as the people of Hong Kong have been
increasingly denied their full auton-
omy and faced with a cruel crackdown
on their freedoms and an escalation of
violence.
Most recently, the violent attacks
against students at Hong Kong Poly-
technic University have shocked the
world as unconscionable and unaccept-
able.
More than 1,000 young people were
denied food, water, first aid. Scores
were sent to the hospital for hypo-
thermia after attempting to escape
through a sewer, and hundreds now lan-
guish in jail cells.
Right now, frightened parents of the
students who remain on campus are
holding vigil outside, praying that
their children will be safe, clutching
signs reading: ‘‘Save the kids. Don’t
kill our children,’’ and, ‘‘They are chil-
dren of God. Let them go.’’
In the Congress, Democrats and Re-
publicans stand united with the
protestors and with the people of Hong
Kong. We have stood united in a bipar-
tisan way.
It has been a very unifying issue for
us, whether we are talking about the
autonomy of Tibet that the Chinese are
trying to destroy, the culture, the lan-
guage, and the region of Tibet; the
Uighurs, where 1, 2, 3, maybe 3 million
Uighurs are under education camps,
which the Chinese Government says
they really enjoy being in—Oh, real-
ly?—or human rights violations, sup-
pression of human rights throughout
all of China.
b 1545
If America does not speak out for
human rights in China because of com-
mercial interests, we lose all moral au-
thority to speak out on human rights
elsewhere.
Since Tiananmen Square, many of us
in a bipartisan way have been fighting
this fight, and we have seen that com-
mercial interests always win the fight.
It has always for them been about
money.
To those who take the repressive Chi-
nese Government’s side, I say: What
does it profit a person to gain the
whole world and suffer the loss of his
soul?
Today the House is proud to once
again pass the bicameral, bipartisan
Hong Kong Human Rights and Democ-
racy Act to reaffirm America’s com-
mitment to human rights, democracy,
and the rule of law in the face of Bei-
jing’s crackdown.
I see we have been joined by the dis-
tinguished ranking member of the For-
eign Affairs Committee, Mr. MCCAUL. I
thank him for his leadership in bring-
ing this legislation to the floor. I ac-
knowledged him earlier, along with our
distinguished chairman, Mr. ENGEL.
We are proud to pass the Senate
version of Chairman MCGOVERN’s Pro-
tect Hong Kong Act to suspend sales on
dangerous munitions to the Hong Kong
police, and we also salute Senator
MERKLEY in his leadership in passing
that on the Senate floor.
The future of Hong Kong, the future
of autonomy, freedom, and justice for
millions is at stake. America must
take a stand with Hong Kong. I am so
pleased that we are making our state-
ment in Congress in the House and in
the Senate on both sides of the aisle,
Democrats and Republicans unified in
speaking out for democracy.
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on both of these
bills.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr.
Speaker, I yield as much time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. MCCAUL), the ranking mem-
ber of the Committee on Foreign Af-
fairs.
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
I rise today in support of the Hong
Kong Human Rights and Democracy
Act. Two months ago I had the oppor-
tunity to join a press conference with
Speaker NANCY PELOSI, Chairman
ENGEL, my colleague, CHRIS SMITH, and
Hong Kong prodemocracy activists
Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, and Denise
Ho to denounce China’s authoritarian
brutality.
I said it then and I will say it again;
today we stand here not as Republicans
or Democrats, but as Americans united
in our strong support for Hong Kong.
And I would like to take this oppor-
tunity to speak directly to the people
of Hong Kong, who I know are watch-
ing this right now. America stands
with you, and America will always sup-
port you. We hear you sing our na-
tional anthem. We see you carrying our
American flag. This is a battle between
democracy versus dictatorship, liberty
versus tyranny, and freedom versus op-
pression.
This bill sends a clear message to
China that there will be consequences
to the ruthless and brutal actions. Con-
gress, the United States, and the world
will not stand by idly as the Chinese
Communist Party fights for itself and
not its own people.
Again, I want to thank the authors of
this bill. I am proud to be a part of this
movement, this cause. And we have
seen quite a bit of response on social
media on this bill coming directly from
the people of Hong Kong to the Mem-
bers who are on this floor saying thank
you for standing up for us.
That is democracy in action. That is
what this country stands for. And it is
a proud moment, I think, for both sides
of the aisle as we are going through
this time in our history to be able to
stand together for democracy and such
a great movement and cause for free-
dom.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4
minutes to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN), an impor-
tant leader on this issue.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
in support of S. 1838, the Hong Kong
Human Rights and Democracy Act.
I want to say thank you to Speaker
NANCY PELOSI for her incredible leader-
ship in ensuring that the House made a
timely and unequivocal statement in
support of the Hong Kong people at
this very important and vital time.
I would also like to thank Congress-
man CHRIS SMITH of New Jersey, as
well as Chairman ENGEL and Ranking
Member MCCAUL for bringing this leg-
islation to the floor today. I also appre-
ciate the leadership of Senators RUBIO,
CARDIN, and MENENDEZ for all that
they have done.
Mr. Speaker, in recent months, the
situation in Hong Kong has worsened
as the Chinese and Hong Kong Govern-
ments have escalated repression
against the protest movement and pro-
voked more violence and chaos.
The recent attacks on university
campuses, including last weekend
against students at Hong Kong Poly-
technic University raises disturbing
questions on the strategy of the Chi-
nese and Hong Kong Governments.
Protestors were violently assaulted
and not even allowed to escape without
facing a barrage of tear gas and police
brutality.
It is long past time for the Chinese
and Hong Kong Governments to try a
different approach that respects the
people of Hong Kong and restores the
people’s faith in the autonomy of the
government. That is what political
leaders do, they use dialogue and nego-
tiation to achieve their goals. The de-
mands of the protestors are reasonable,
and an independent inquiry into the
police violence is more than justified.
In what was initially a positive de-
velopment, this week the Hong Kong
High Court decided that the govern-
ment’s recent facemask ban was uncon-
stitutional. Unfortunately, the fierce

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9095

response by Beijing to that ruling and
claim of sole jurisdiction over con-
stitutional review almost certainly
violates the basic law, subverts the
rule of law, and further undermines
whatever trust the Hong Kong people
have left in their governing institu-
tions.
If the Hong Kong court system is not
sufficiently autonomous, then it is dif-
ficult, if not impossible, to argue that
Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous.
It should be clear by now that Hong
Kong’s leaders are beholden to the Chi-
nese Government, and the independ-
ence of the judiciary is being under-
mined.
The ‘‘one country, two systems’’
framework enshrined in the 1984 Sino-
British Joint Declaration and Hong
Kong’s basic law has been rapidly erod-
ing and has now reached a point when
the United States has no choice but to
modify its policy toward Hong Kong.
It is time we put the Chinese Govern-
ment on annual notice that further
erosion of autonomy or a crackdown
will cause the city, which serves as an
important financial haven for wealthy
Chinese elites, to lose its special eco-
nomic, financial and trade arrange-
ment with the United States.
Further, the legislation authorizes
sanctions against individuals who vio-
late human rights, and states that
Hong Kong visa applicants should not
be denied entry to the U.S. on the basis
of politically-motivated arrests due to
their protest activities.
Today a Chinese official said that
they will take strong opposing meas-
ures if the Hong Kong Human Rights
and Democracy bill passes.
Well, I have a message for Beijing:
The United States will not stand idly
by while the Chinese Government sti-
fles free expression and tightens its
grip on Hong Kong.
Over the years, Hong Kong has pros-
pered and become the financial center
of Asia because of its strong commit-
ment to the rule of law, good govern-
ance, human rights, and an open eco-
nomic system.
We must use our leverage to help the
people of Hong Kong in their struggle
to secure a democratic future that pro-
tects Hong Kong’s autonomy and way
of life.
I am proud to support this legisla-
tion, which we will pass today with an
overwhelmingly bipartisan majority.
I now call upon the President of the
United States, who has been way too
silent on this issue, to sign the bill into
law.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr.
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO), the
ranking member of the Asia, the Pa-
cific, and Nonproliferation Sub-
committee.
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I just want
to give a shout-out to the bipartisan
nature of this bill. Both sides are work-
ing strongly on this. Chairman ENGEL,
thank you. Mr. MCGOVERN, thank you.
CHRIS, thank you for doing what you
have done. It is true leadership. And to
see Speaker PELOSI down here, I think
it speaks loudly to how America stands
on this.
In September, I, too, had the honor of
meeting with a few of the courageous
leaders of Hong Kong student unions.
They were advocating for peace, lib-
erty, and freedom. These are basic in-
nate human rights that have been
taken away from Hong Kongers by the
authoritarian overreach of the Chinese
Communist Party Complex, which is
comprised of Xi Jinping, the Politburo
of the Chinese Communist Party, and
leadership within the People’s Libera-
tion Army.
As protests in Hong Kong continue
into the sixth month, Xi Jinping still
refuses to take responsibility for this
unrest. The cause is simple: theft of
basic rights and freedoms, not a sepa-
ratist movement or foreign influence.
Members of this body have been ac-
cused of being the cause of the pro-
tests. Speaker PELOSI was named indi-
vidually. Senator SCHUMER, MARCO
RUBIO, and I were named as the cause
of the Hong Kong protests.
This disdain was sparked by the in-
troduction of the infamous extradition
bill by Chief Executive Carrie Lam at
the command of the CCPC and has
grown into what are known as the five
demands. Had Xi Jinping and his co-
horts just honored the 1997 inter-
national agreement between Great
Britain and China, which allows Hong
Kong to remain a self-ruling, semi-au-
tonomous province, none of this would
have occurred.
Not upholding one’s contract has
consequences. Disregarding contracts
breaks trust and dishonors the coun-
try, its leaders, and its people. The nar-
rative that the Chinese Communist
Party Complex has created for itself is
that China cannot and should not be
trusted and that the party will go to
great lengths to dismantle free soci-
eties in their backyard.
The survival of democracy and free-
dom exposes the failures of com-
munism. Xi Jinping, along with his co-
horts’ lack of acknowledgment of their
failures, whether from deliberate de-
nial or complete ignorance, was dem-
onstrated by Mr. Han Zheng, China’s
Vice Premier, who said he believes
antigovernment protests are damaging
the ‘‘one country, two systems’’ for-
mula, and again, are caused by a sepa-
ratist movement and foreign influence.
While sitting next to Chief Executive
Carrie Lam, he continued, ‘‘We firmly
support the Special Administrative Re-
gion Government to adopt more
proactive and more effective meas-
ures’’ to solve the social problems.
Since I wrote this, they have come
out and said they expect to have bru-
tality ramped up to bring these people
under control. The proactive and more
effective measures referred to by Mr.
Han Zheng are intimidation, brutality,
imprisonment and death.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman’s time has expired.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr.
Speaker, I yield the gentleman from
Florida an additional 1 minute.
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, as the inter-
national community is well aware, Bei-
jing’s standard procedure for dealing
with unrest is well documented. In the
end, Xi Jinping will leave no stone
unturned in his quest to destroy de-
mocracy. The party will spare no one
in their fight to protect communist
ideals and power. Chief Executive Lam
will be Beijing’s sacrificial lamb and
removed for two reasons: one, the Com-
munist Party must save face and have
a scapegoat; and two, Xi Jinping and
the Communist Party must maintain
their authority and not show weakness.
Communism fears free thought and
cannot survive in it. And I am honored
to stand with the Hong Kong protestors
in their important cause. I urge my
colleagues to also stand with the cou-
rageous individuals in Hong Kong and
pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and
Democracy Act.
‘‘Jia you’’ to our Hong Kong friends
standing up for your basic human
rights.
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield the
balance of my time to the gentleman
from California (Mr. SHERMAN), and I
ask unanimous consent that he be al-
lowed to control the time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr.
Speaker, I yield as much time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
Arkansas (Mr. HILL).
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from New Jersey,
my good friend, for yielding, and I have
to thank him for his decades of service
and leadership here for free expression
and for liberty in Hong Kong.
I was moved by the Speaker’s tribute
and appreciate her 30 years of work
there. I thank Mr. ENGEL for his leader-
ship, and, of course, my good friend
from California, who now is controlling
the time for the majority.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong
support of the Hong Kong Human
Rights and Democracy Act and stand
in solidarity with the people of Hong
Kong.
For 6 months, we have witnessed
Hong Kong citizens protest for their
right to live in a free and fair political
system, an expectation they fully have.
Over the last several weeks, we have
witnessed the government become in-
creasingly violent as it cracks down on
protests. It is sad to see death and de-
struction come to this beautiful and
energetic place.
For three decades, I have traveled to
Hong Kong and witnessed their innova-
tive spirit and their extraordinary
work ethic. In fact, Hong Kong was the
model for the post-World War II Asian

Tiger growth and prosperity now

ponent of welfare statism queried
progrowth economist Melvyn B.
Krauss, ‘‘But how many Hong Kongs
can the world have?’’ the professor re-
sponded, ‘‘As many as the world will
allow itself.’’
The 7 million citizens of Hong Kong
are looking to us for a voice and for
leadership, and with today’s vote, we
will deliver. I call on President Trump
to sign this important measure into
law with expediency and show the
world that America supports the people
of Hong Kong, their right to free ex-
pression, and their democratic govern-
ance guaranteed under the five-decade
arrangement agreed to in 1997 by the
People’s Republic of China and the
United Kingdom.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. SMITH for
his leadership, and I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this measure.
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I will
close when the gentleman has closed on
his side, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of
my time.
Mr. Speaker, the United States’ and
the world’s response to the Tiananmen
Square massacre 30 years ago and the
massive crackdown that was unleashed
after that, because of that weak re-
sponse, has enabled unrelenting and
pervasive human rights abuses ever
since.
Had we been strong and predictable
and said that human rights matter, had
we linked it to MFN, most-favored-na-
tion status, and stuck to it, we would
have had a different China today that,
at least more than it does today, would
have respected the rule of law and
human rights.
We cannot recommit that mistake by
being weak and vacillating in the face
of this terrible, terrible attack on the
people of Hong Kong and on their au-
tonomy.
Remember, what we are asking Xi
Jinping, Carrie Lam, and all the other
leaders in Hong Kong and in Beijing to
do is just honor your promises; you
made solemn promises that you are
violating now with impunity.
We have to be very clear that if we
enable that, if we look the other way,
then we become unwittingly, perhaps,
but complicit in this terrible degrading
of the human rights situation for the
people of Hong Kong.
Mr. Speaker, I want to remind my
colleagues as well, and I think we all
know this, but this bill is the work of
so many who deeply care, many Mem-
bers across the aisle, bipartisanship at
a time when that seems to be pretty
much a rare commodity, but when it
comes to Hong Kong, we are all there
joined together arm-in-arm speaking
out on behalf of these tremendous lead-
ers who suffer and go to prison and en-
dure tear gas and worse each and every
day.
I want to mention some of the staff
members, and there are many. When
we had the bill up on the 15th, I men-
tioned even more. But these members
were instrumental in working on the
legislation over the past 5 years. Re-
member, this is the fourth time I intro-
duced it, and I have worked with
MARCO RUBIO and others. This is a bi-
cameral and bipartisan bill.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank former
staff directors of the Congressional-Ex-
ecutive Commission on China, Paul
Protic and Elise Anderson, for their
important work on Hong Kong and
China. I want to thank Piero Tozzi of
my staff for his focus on human rights
in China and around the world. I par-
ticularly want to mention the con-
tribution made to this legislation by
Scott Flipse of the CECC, the Congres-
sional-Executive Commission on China.
In 2014, Dr. Flipse first convinced me.
We had met, and he said that we have
a problem in Hong Kong and that we
need to address it. I was co-chair of the
China Commission. Then we had meet-
ings with Chinese leaders and Hong
Kong leaders. We began to see that
what was taking place in somewhat
slow motion before our eyes was that
there was a long-term Beijing plan to
undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy and
that the U.S. needed to focus its efforts
on countering that plan. He has been a
stalwart advocate for the people of
Hong Kong ever since, and I, again,
want to thank him for his critical con-
tributions to this legislation.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume for
the purpose of closing.
We vote today on S. 1838, but this is
not just a Senate bill. This is a bill
very similar to the one introduced in
this House by the gentleman from New
Jersey. This House has already voted
on this bill and supported it over-
whelmingly. Today, once again, we
show the world our commitment to the
people of Hong Kong and to the preser-
vation and protection of Hong Kong’s
autonomy, given China’s aggressive at-
tempts to undermine the ‘‘one country,
two systems’’ approach.
With this important legislation, we
send a clear signal that the United
States will hold those undermining
Hong Kong’s rights and autonomy ac-
countable and that the American peo-
ple stand shoulder to shoulder with the
people of Hong Kong. With few excep-
tions, the people of Hong Kong have
fought for their rights through peace-
able protest, and we stand with them.
Mr. Speaker, I hope all Members will
join me in supporting the passage of
this bill, and I yield back the balance
of my time.

MCGOVERN). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentleman from

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-

have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous materials on S. 2710.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California?
There was no objection.
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, let me start by thank-
ing Senator MERKLEY for his hard work
on this legislation. The House a few
weeks before passed a similar measure,
the PROTECT Hong Kong Act, au-
thored by the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN), whom I was
about to refer to as the Chair but has
now joined us here in the regular seats
of the House.
Such bipartisan, bicameral legisla-
tion supporting the people of Hong
Kong is a testament to the relationship
between our two peoples, but it is also
an indication of Congress’ deep concern
over the growing violence in Hong
Kong.
In recent weeks, we have seen an es-
calation in the conflict between Hong
Kong’s security forces and the people
of Hong Kong. The same police forces
sworn to protect the people are now in-
discriminately targeting people with
tear gas, pepper spray, and water can-
nons. I am particularly heartbroken
over the images of students under siege
and parents begging the police not to
shoot their children.
We have seen similar images before,
just 30 years ago in Beijing. The fact
that these horrors are now taking
place in Hong Kong, a beacon of democ-
racy and human rights, is worrisome. I
am deeply concerned by the recent es-
calation of violence, and I call on all
parties to exercise restraint and seek a
peaceful solution to address the very
legitimate concerns of the people of
Hong Kong.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in supporting this important
measure and ensure that U.S. compa-
nies are not contributing to the sup-
pression of Hong Kong’s people in their
fight to secure their freedoms and their
democracy.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr.
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support
of S. 2710, a bill that would prohibit the
commercial export of covered munition
items to the Hong Kong Police Force.
Mr. Speaker, I especially want to
thank my good friend and colleague,
Chairman MCGOVERN, for his legisla-
tion, which is pretty much a com-
panion bill that passed a little over 1
month ago, again, on the whole idea of
U.S.-originated equipment being ex-
ploited in Hong Kong against these
protesters. I thank him for doing that.
We have raised this at hearings, and
his bill was a great bill.
As the largest protest movement
Hong Kong has ever seen continues,
major concerns have arisen about the
Hong Kong police’s independence and
professionalism. The people of Hong
Kong are rightfully furious about well-
documented cases of excessive force,
brutal tactics, and tolerance of vio-
lence against protesters. The Hong
Kong police themselves are now a
cause of the protests.
There has been widespread police
misuse of crowd control equipment and
less-lethal weaponry, including inci-
dents that have seriously injured jour-
nalists.
I am glad this bill is before us. After
it passes, it goes to the President, and
I fully expect he will sign it into law.
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, Mem-
bers of this House will remember that,
just a few months ago, we passed very
similar legislation in the House to the
bill that is in front of us today.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the
gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.
MCGOVERN), who is an important lead-
er on this issue. The gentleman wrote
the House version of this bill.
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I
thank my colleague from California
(Mr. SHERMAN) for his leadership on
this and so many other important
issues to uphold a high standard of
human rights.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S.
2710, the Placing Restrictions on Tear-
gas Exports and Crowd Control Tech-
nology to Hong Kong Act, otherwise
known as the PROTECT Hong Kong
Act.
I am proud to have introduced this
bipartisan legislation, along with my
colleagues CHRIS SMITH from New Jer-
sey and RO KHANNA from California, in
the House. Senator MERKLEY and Sen-
ator CORNYN introduced it in the Sen-
ate.
This bill responds to the excessive
and unnecessary use of force by the
Hong Kong police targeting those en-
gaged in peaceful protests.
The PROTECT Hong Kong Act pro-
hibits U.S. exports of police equipment
to Hong Kong, including tear gas, pep-
per spray, grenades, rubber bullets,
foam rounds, beanbag rounds, pepper
balls, water cannons, stun guns, and
tasers.
The Hong Kong Police Force is sim-
ply out of control. The reckless and es-
calating use of violence flies in the face
of manufacturer guidelines and inter-
national standards on the use of force.
In recent days, the world has seen eye-
witness evidence showing protesters
sprayed with tear gas directly in the
face at short distances, rampant beat-
ings and arbitrary arrests of people
ages 11 to 74, police driving at high
speeds into crowds, and unarmed pro-
testers shot with live rounds.
The British Government already sus-
pended export licenses for the sale of
tear gas and crowd control equipment
until concerns about human rights
abuses are addressed. The United Na-
tions High Commissioner for Human
Rights called for an investigation of
the use of crowd control tactics in
Hong Kong.
Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. It is
time for American companies to stop
selling police equipment that is being
used to suppress peaceful protests.
Mr. Speaker, today, we will cast
votes on two pieces of legislation that
will make it crystal clear to Beijing
that we in this Congress in a bipartisan
manner stand in solidarity with the
protesters of Hong Kong, and we also
stand with them in their demands,
among which is there needs to be an
independent investigation and inquiry
into the brutal tactics of the Hong
Kong Police Force.
It is absolutely outrageous. It is un-
acceptable. It goes beyond the pale. We
have all seen the pictures, the photo-
graphs, and the videos that are on so-
cial media. Anybody who cares about
human rights will stand with us proud-
ly and vote for these two pieces of leg-
islation.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this PROTECT Hong
Kong Act.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr.
Speaker, I have no further requests for
time, and I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume for
the purpose of closing.
Mr. Speaker, we have watched as the
Chinese Communist Party works to
break down and undermine the ‘‘one
country, two systems’’ framework that
has paved the way for a strong rela-
tionship between Hong Kong and the
United States.
This has motivated millions of Hong
Kongers, the people of Hong Kong, to
take to the streets for months to pro-
test in defense of their basic human
rights. These prodemocracy activists
have faced tear gas, pepper spray, and
rubber bullets by a police force sworn
to protect them, and now they face le-
thal force as well.
b 1615
The passage of this bill dem-
onstrates, once again, to the people of
Hong Kong that the United States
stands with them in their protest of
China’s erosion of the autonomy and
the way of life that was promised them
back in 1997.
It takes a step to ensure that U.S.
companies demonstrate a commitment
to U.S. values in this regard, making
sure that U.S. companies aren’t facili-
tating violence against the protestors
by selling what we, sadly, know can be
lethal crowd control mechanisms.
This bill is an important part of Con-
gress’ response by the effort of Beijing
to deprive Hong Kong of the autonomy
and democracy that it was promised
back in 1997.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in supporting this bill, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
CUELLAR). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentleman from

cast my votes on November 20, 2019 for roll-
call 632, rollcall 633, rollcall 634, rollcall 635,
and rollcall 636. Had I been present, I would
have voted ‘‘yes’’ on rollcall 632, ‘‘yes’’ on roll-
call 633, ‘‘yes’’ on rollcall 634 (H.R. 737—
Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act), ‘‘yes’’ on roll-
call 635 (S. 1838—Hong Kong Human Rights
and Democracy Act of 2019), and ‘‘yes’’ on
rollcall 636 (S. 2710—To prohibit the commer-
cial export of covered munitions items to the
Hong Kong Police Force). I am proud to sup-
port the people of Hong Kong.

APPOINTMENT OF MEMBER TO
THE CANADA-UNITED STATES
INTERPARLIAMENTARY GROUP
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
CASTEN of Illinois). The Chair an-
nounces the Speaker’s appointment,
pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 276d and the order
of the House of January 3, 2019, of the
following Member on the part of the
House to the Canada-United States
Interparliamentary Group:
Mr. HUIZENGA, Michigan
f
MOMENT OF SILENCE IN HONOR
OF THE PASSING OF MRS.
FAHARI JEFFERS
(Mr. VARGAS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today, along with my colleagues,
SUSAN DAVIS, SCOTT PETERS, MIKE
LEVIN, and Chairwoman MAXINE
WATERS, to honor Mrs. Fahari Jeffers,
who passed away on October 30, for her
outstanding actions as a tireless civil
rights and labor leader and motivator
and as the cofounder of the United Do-
mestic Workers of America.
In 1977, Fahari Jeffers and her hus-
band, Ken Msemaji, formed the United
Domestic Workers organizing com-
mittee under the mentorship of Cesar
Chavez. It was the first known labor
organization for domestic workers in
the United States of America and only
the third labor union in U.S. labor his-
tory to be founded by Latinos or Afri-
can Americans.
Additionally, Mrs. Jeffers served as
United Domestic Workers’ secretary-
treasurer and first general counsel
until 2005.
Ms. Jeffers worked tirelessly as lead
negotiator for all union contracts
throughout the State of California,
pursuing life improvements that helped
millions of Americans in the State and
nationwide.
Her model collective bargain rights
law of 1999 is patterned across Cali-
fornia and the Nation, where over 2
million home care workers enjoy union
rights. Fahari regarded writing this
legislation as one of her proudest ac-
complishments.
Asserting rights for our Nation’s do-
mestic workers gave way to the pas-
sage of the first-ever Federal Domestic
Workers Bill of Rights in 2013.
Mrs. Jeffers used her skills and expe-
rience to represent and defend the
rights of one of the most underrep-
resented and underpaid working groups
in our society: our home care workers,
who clean, cook, and provide personal
care assistance to the sick and dis-
abled.
In 2018, Fahari was inducted into the
San Diego County Women’s Hall of
Fame.
At home in National City, the de-
voutly Catholic couple adopted 16 chil-
dren over the years. Survivors include
her husband of 44 years, Ken Msemaji;
her siblings, Rose Glasford of Bermuda,
Karama Broach of North Carolina, Joe
Jeffers of Colorado, Vickie Jeffers of
North Carolina, and Dr. Adam Jeffers
of the United Arab Emirates; and her
adopted children.
We would like to honor Fahari Jef-
fers for her dedication and lifelong
commitment to civil rights, the labor
movement, and the community.
I ask that Members and guests in the
gallery rise for a moment of silence.

aster loans, and ask for its immediate

woman from Minnesota?

HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that when the
House adjourns today, it adjourn to
meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey?
There was no objection.
f
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL
ENTREPRENEURSHIP MONTH
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize November as Na-
tional Entrepreneurship Month.
America has always been known as a
land of innovation, and entrepreneurs
combine innovation with capitalism.
But there is a group of future busi-
ness leaders that need our help, the mi-
nority entrepreneurs. Many do not get
the funds they need, based on bias in
the banking and loan industry. Too
many bank managers still refuse to see
minorities as worthy of loans. When
they do get them, minorities are
charged higher interest rates on aver-
age than Whites. Many do not even fill
out the loan applications because they
know they will be rejected. Major
banks have programs to deal with it,
but clearly more needs to be done. We
need to make sure loans are distributed
based on credentials of the applicant,
not the color of his or her skin.
f
RECOGNIZING ALZHEIMER’S
AWARENESS MONTH
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, No-
vember is Alzheimer’s Awareness
Month. I rise to recognize the millions
of Americans across this great country
who are living with Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias.
Alzheimer’s is a frightening disease
that has impacted several individuals
close to me. My Aunt Jane lost her
battle with the disease, while my Aunt
Virginia continues to fight it. Addi-
tionally, the legendary Pat Summitt, a
friend of mine—she actually came to
my father’s funeral—who coached the
University of Tennessee Lady Vols bas-
ketball team for 38 seasons, lived with
and brought awareness to Alzheimer’s
disease before passing away in 2016.
I am especially thankful for the care-
givers who assist those living with a
memory disorder. Friends, family
members, and trained professionals
care for these patients and make sac-
rifices to ensure their comfort. These
efforts must not be overlooked, Mr.
Speaker.
Individuals diagnosed with Alz-
heimer’s need to know they are not
alone in their battle against this dif-
ficult illness. And while I remain opti-
mistic about new treatments and ongo-
ing research to find a cure, this Novem-
ber I encourage my constituents and
colleagues to take a moment to think
about those Americans living with Alz-
heimer’s disease and say a prayer for
them and their families and to show
support for the caregivers who look
after and advocate for them.
f
RECOGNIZING LATINA EQUAL PAY
DAY
(Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Mr.
Speaker, today we recognize Latina
Equal Pay Day. I want to start by em-
phasizing that the gender pay gap is
real, and it hurts Latina women and
families.
We know that Latinas make only 54
cents for every dollar that a White
non-Hispanic male makes for doing the
same job. Let that sink in for just one
moment. In 2019, Latina women get
paid 54 cents for every dollar a non-His-
panic man makes for the same work.
In fact, a Latina must work an addi-
tional 35 years to catch up to the earn-
ings of a 60-year-old man, averaging to
about $1.1 million in loss of earnings
during a 40-year career. Continuing to
ignore this disparity has repercussions
in many aspects of our economy, and it
leaves over 40 percent of families that
are headed by a Latina in poverty.
We must find a way to close the wage
for the sake of our mothers, our sis-
ters, our daughters, and our families.

RECOGNIZING SCOTT SEWELL
(Ms. FOXX of North Carolina asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute.)
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to recognize
Scott Sewell for his 4 years of service
as president of the Winston-Salem Po-
lice Foundation. When he steps down
as president in December, Mr. Sewell
will be able to look back on his term
and be extremely proud of the suc-
cesses he has had.
Mr. Sewell has led the foundation in
a manner that truly gives back to the
community. One such example is when,
under his leadership, the foundation
donated to the Winston-Salem Police
Department the Operation Sweet Reads
truck, which will be used to engage
with local children with ice cream and
promote literacy and education.
Scott Sewell has served his commu-
nity well, and he will continue to do so
even after his term has ended. He is an
exemplary member of the community,
and I am proud to call him a friend and
to recognize his service.
f
HONORING MIKE MAROTTA, SR.
(Mr. PANETTA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor the memory of Mike
Marotta, Sr., an entertainment legend,
a Monterey native, and a cornerstone
of the Italian American community on
the central coast of California in my
district.
I am sorry to say, Mike passed away
earlier this week at the age of 98. Mike
was a family man, a businessman, and
a civic leader.
But I have to say everyone who knew
him knew that music was Mike’s first
and everlasting love. He taught himself
how to play the accordion when he was
11 years old. He would then take the
accordion down to the bay and play for
the Italian fishermen coming back and
unloading their catch.
His musical journey even led him to
Hollywood eventually, where he played
with stars like Roy Rogers and Dale
Evans. During his military service dur-
ing World War II, he entertained the
troops throughout the United States.
Now, recently you could find Mike
playing Italian songs with his kids and
grandkids and even at the Paisano
Club, but also you could find him con-
tinuing his tradition of playing for
fishermen and our community at the
Festa Italia Santa Rosalia, the premier
Italian American festival on the cen-
tral coast of California.

Mike’s civic-mindedness and his musi-
cal gift will be missed by our commu-
nity, but his legacy and his love of
music will be carried on by his family
and friends through his everlasting
songs played by his son, but most im-
portantly, through the love in our
hearts for Mike Marotta, Sr.

RECOGNIZING RITA BISHOP
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Roanoke Superintendent
of Schools, Rita Bishop.
Superintendent Bishop has served the
students of Roanoke City for more
than 12 years and will retire at the
school year’s end. Her tenure is marked
with significant accomplishments, and
I applaud the passion she exudes for
the students of her district.
During her time of service to the
community, graduation rates improved
from 60 percent in 2007 to now over 90
percent. Further, under her leadership,
all schools have achieved full accredi-
tation division wide, a feat that had
never before been accomplished.
Additionally, Ms. Bishop was essen-
tial in launching Roanoke’s summer
enrichment program RCPS-Plus. This
program seeks to address what is
known as the ‘‘summer slide’’ by ensur-
ing knowledge is not lost between
school years. Last summer, a record
3,400 students enrolled in this program.
I want to thank Ms. Bishop for her
dedication to improving the city’s edu-
cation system and wish her a happy,
well-deserved retirement.
f
RECOGNIZING LOCAL PAGEANT
TITLEHOLDERS
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I want
to highlight three exceptional young
ladies who reside in my district in
south Jersey. They are pageant title-
holders who work for the greater good
of our community.
Madison Stiles is a Salem County na-
tive, who uses her title to promote
mental health awareness. She is an
avid volunteer through her community
and is a fantastic advocate for the im-
portant subject of mental health.
Miss Vineland 2019, Marissa Mar-
chese, who resides in Vineland, New
Jersey, created a platform called
‘‘Homeless Has a Face’’ that allows her
to educate individuals on the harsh re-
alities of being displaced and share the
stories of those who are not fortunate
enough to have a roof over their heads.
Lastly, but certainly not least,
Jaslene Candelaria, at the young age of
11, created a platform that collects
stuffed animals, blankets, and inspira-
tional cards for cancer patients of all
ages. Her goal is to bring joy and
smiles to patients, and she visits var-
ious hospitals throughout her commu-
nity to make sure to do so.
Mr. Speaker, I thank them all for
their selfless and benevolent work
throughout their communities. Our fu-
ture is in wonderful hands with them.
They are our heroes, and may God
bless them.
f
CONGRATULATING LAKELAND
LINDER INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Lakeland Linder
International Airport on receiving
their second Department of Transpor-
tation grant, this time totaling $81⁄2
million.
Lakeland Linder has over 125,000 air-
craft operations annually and is be-
coming a central hub for major compa-
nies like Amazon.
The airport is also home to the
NOAA Hurricane Hunters, the Central
Florida Aerospace Academy, and Polk
State College’s Aerospace programs.
This grant provides the funding to
make needed improvements to the
aging runway and infrastructure that
will further attract new businesses and
jobs.
Well done to Airport Director Eugene
Conrad and his team for their vision
and hard work. He contributes signifi-
cantly to District 15 and our economic
growth, and we thank him.
f
SOMETHING HAS GOT TO GIVE
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, in our con-
versation about gun violence, one side
sees the need for background checks.
The other side prefers to ‘‘enforce the
laws we already have.’’ Yet we do not
have universal background checks, so
we cannot enforce it. Meanwhile, our
children are exposed.
This year there have been 45 school
shootings in 46 weeks, 370 mass shoot-
ings by the end of October. That is
more than one per day. Something has
got to give.
Senator MCCONNELL said he will hold
a vote on our background check bill
only if President Trump says he will
sign it.
So let me address the President di-
rectly from the heart: Sir, I have two
granddaughters. Aubrey is eight; Ella
is just one-month old. When Aubrey at-
tends terrifying active shooter drills,
what would you have me tell her? How
about when she notices that we have
laws barring certain people from own-
ing guns, but that much of the time we
don’t bother to check who is who? Or
when she realizes that her leaders
could have put basic lifesaving safe-
guards in place, and they chose not to,
what shall I say to her? What would
you tell her?
President Trump, my grand-
daughters, your grandchildren need
your leadership, and so does America.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.

HONORING LOUIS BRINNER
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, on Novem-
ber 22, Louis Brinner, a World War II
veteran from Mississippi, will celebrate
his 100th birthday.
Mr. Brinner served in the United
States Army as a private first-class
with the 645th MP Company. After en-
listing at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, on
May 8, 1941, he fought alongside Allied
troops in Italy, which were successful
in liberating Italian cities such as
Rome and Naples in the Rome-Arno
campaign.
For his service, Mr. Brinner earned
decorations, including the American
Defense Service Medal, European-Afri-
can-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal,
and a Good Conduct Medal.
Mr. Brinner was discharged from the
Army on October 16, 1945, after more
than 4 years of honorable service to the
United States.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank
Mr. Brinner for his dedicated service to
our country and to wish Mr. Brinner
the happiest of birthdays.

HONORING FAHARI JEFFERS
(Ms. WATERS asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1

Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, my
friend Fahari Jeffers’ legacy as a civil
rights and labor rights leader in Amer-
ican history had its beginning in the
Black Power movement. She joined the
San Diego chapter of the U.S. organiza-
tion in 1967 and served as a teacher in
the weekend School of Afro-American
Culture for Children.
A dedicated civil rights advocate and
cultural rights powerhouse, she became
involved in labor union organizing,
having convened the major African
People’s gatherings in the 1970s and
worked with the NIA cultural organiza-
tion in San Diego.
Fahari was proud of her roots in the
Black Power movement. Her early
work prepared her for the work that
Cesar Chavez recruited and trained her
and her husband, Ken Msemaji, to do in
founding and building the United Do-
mestic Workers of America. Today,
over 200,000 California homecare work-
ers and nearly 2 million nationally
work under union contracts. Her model
of collective bargaining rights law is
now patterned across the Nation. On

SUPPORT BIPARTISAN PATH FOR
USMCA
(Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of
the continued effort by the U.S. Trade
Representative and the Democratic
working group to finalize the United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the
USMCA.
Oklahoma workers, families, busi-
nesses, and our Nation benefit from
free and fair international trade. Every
day, Oklahomans create and export
world-class products, and two of our
largest trading partners are our neigh-
bors to the north and the south.
In 2018 alone, Oklahoma exported a
total of $5.6 billion in manufactured
goods. Nearly half of those went to
Mexico and Canada. In the same year,
Oklahoma agriculture exports to Mex-
ico and Canada totaled $154 million.
A stronger trading relationship with
Mexico and Canada means a stronger
economy for Oklahoma. It is impera-
tive that Congress finish negotiating
and pass a strong trade agreement to
restore certainty in our trading rela-
tionship with Canada and Mexico and
support millions of American jobs in
the process.
Though finding common ground is
not easy, it is critical, and I support
the USTR and lawmakers’ work to find
a bipartisan path forward for this im-
portant trade agreement.
f
HONORING TRACY SINGLE ON
TRANSGENDER DAY OF REMEM-
BRANCE
(Mrs. FLETCHER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Speaker,
today, on Transgender Remembrance
Day, I rise to remember Tracy Single,
who was killed in July of this year in
my district, the 15th transgender
woman of color murdered this year.
A music lover with an eye for fashion
and an ear for music, 22-year-old Tracy
moved to Houston to pursue her dream
of becoming a rapper. Tension around
her gender identity forced her out of
her home, and she experienced a very
hard time, but she was persistent and
upbeat, always working to achieve her
goals.
Her life reminds us that creative and
vibrant people can thrive even in the
most difficult circumstances. And her
death reminds us that transgender peo-
ple are under attack and must have
equal protection under the law.
f
HONORING TOM VASQUEZ
(Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker,
today, I rise to honor the memory of
my dear friend Tom Vasquez, who
passed away on July 23. Tom was one of
the founders of our progressive move-
ment in Chicago, and we were partners
in many battles.
He was born in Matamoros, Mexico,
and eventually found his way to Chi-
cago, settling in the working-class
community of Little Village. In the
early 1980s, Tom was part of a group of
young people who saw the disparities
and lack of political representation in
our community and sought to address
these inequalities.
He stepped up, led the change, and
helped create the Independent Political
Organization of the 22nd Ward. He was
a precinct captain for many years. He
organized block clubs and he was in-
volved in schools in the local commu-
nity. On election day, he was always
getting people to the polling places. He
attended many community meetings
and mentored many young people in
the community. He did this all while
holding a full-time job with the Chi-
cago Transit Authority and being a
member of a local union.
Tom’s passing has left a gap not only
for his family but for the entire com-
munity that benefited from his service
and commitment to justice.
Tom, may you rest in peace.

NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
GREEN of Texas). Under the Speaker’s
announced policy of January 3, 2019,
the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.
LAMBORN) is recognized for 60 minutes
as the designee of the minority leader.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous materials on the
topic of my Special Order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado?
There was no objection.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, it is a
great honor for me to come to the
House floor tonight to commemorate
National Bible Week. This is an oppor-
tunity to celebrate the tremendous in-
fluence of the Bible on the freedoms we
enjoy today in America.
We are truly blessed to live in a na-
tion where we are free to worship and
read the Holy Scriptures without fear
of persecution. There are many places
throughout the world where such free-
doms do not exist.
Americans have the right under our
wonderful system of government to re-
spect and study the Bible or any other
system of belief that they so choose or
even none at all. That is the beauty of
the American way, and I believe it goes
all the way back to the Bible.
In 1941, President Franklin Delano
Roosevelt declared the week of
Thanksgiving to be National Bible
Week. The National Bible Association
and the U.S. Conference of Bishops
have designated the specific days of
November 18 to 24 as National Bible
Week this year. This is the week set
aside to recognize the Bible as a
foundational building block of Western
civilization, the Judeo-Christian herit-
age, and the legacy that motivated and
shaped the founding of the United
States.
In this hour, we will hear from Mem-
bers of Congress from all throughout
the United States from various faith
traditions and denominations speak
about what the Bible means to them.
We are here, in keeping with tradition,
to recognize National Bible Week.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Washington (Mrs. ROD-
GERS), who is a good friend and col-
league.
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr.
Speaker, I want to say thank you to
the gentleman from Colorado for bring-
ing us all together tonight for National
Bible Week.
Over the weekend, I finished reading
through the Bible in a year, and I can
testify that it has been the best year of
my life in giving me perspective and
quiet confidence for every day, remind-
ing me to lead with love.
The Bible says to love your enemies
and pray for those who persecute you.
The Word of God is the source of love,
joy, peace, patience, kindness, good-
ness, and self-control. Everything that
we long for in life is found in the Word
of God, the Bible.
So why haven’t I been more faithful
to read the Bible every day earlier in
my life? Because, like a lot of people, I
didn’t always feel like I had enough
time, or I struggled to relate to the
language.
Why read the Bible? Why wake up 15
minutes early each day? Why go to all
that trouble? That was my struggle for
many, many years.
The Bible says in Psalm 90:12: ‘‘Teach
us to number our days, that we may
gain a heart of wisdom.’’
Psalm 103 says that ‘‘our days are few
and brief, like grass, like flowers,
blown by the wind and gone forever,’’
yet the Word of God endures forever.
It is the Bible that provides us an-
swers to our questions about life more
than any other book, seminar, or self-
help program.
The Bible also offers words of encour-
agement and hope at a time when de-
spair has come over our country. We
have record suicides. A million people
in America attempted suicide last

year, and 47,000 committed suicide. I
grieve this loss.
The deaths of despair are sky-
rocketing: suicide, drug overdoses,
opioids, alcohol, and drug abuse. Peo-
ple are giving up on life.
The Bible says in Matthew that not a
single sparrow can fall to the ground
without your Father knowing it. And
the very hairs on your head are num-
bered, so don’t be afraid, you are more
valuable to God.
We need the truth and the wisdom of
the Bible. As Proverbs 12:18 says:
‘‘Careless words stab like a sword, but
wise words bring healing.’’
As I begin a second year of taking 15
minutes a day to read the Bible and
then pray, I would invite each one of
you to join me. Let’s do it together.
Let’s agree that it cannot be business
as usual. Let’s see what God could do
on Capitol Hill through Members and
staff who daily walk the Halls of Con-
gress—Democrats and Republicans,
House and Senate, men and women—if
we all read through the Bible in 2020.
I am convinced the Democrats can’t
fix it. The Republicans can’t fix it.
Only God can fix it.
My daily prayer is 2 Chronicles 7:14:
‘‘If my people, who are called by my
name, will humble themselves and pray
and seek my face and turn from their
wicked ways, then I will hear from
Heaven, and I will forgive their sin and
will heal their land.’’
Lord God, heal our land. May You
bring order out of chaos. Lift the heav-
iness of misery and despair and busy-
ness. Remind us that You are with us
in everything we do.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman for her words of wis-
dom, her personal experience, and for
being here tonight.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. BABIN).
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my
dear colleague for having this.
Since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941,
every U.S. President has declared the
week of Thanksgiving to be National
Bible Week. Next week, we will, once
again, celebrate this beloved book,
which continues to mold the lives of
millions and even billions around the
world.
It is fitting that we take time today
to bring attention to the very book
that was so influential in the founding
of our Nation. The Holy Bible was per-
haps the most accessible book to our
Founding Fathers. Its principles gave
them invaluable insights into human
nature, civic virtue, political author-
ity, and the rights of citizens.
Personally, I consider it a huge and
great privilege to speak on the House
floor today about a book that has had
such a profound influence on my life
and on the life of our country, and it
continues to do so daily.
As a believer in Christ, the Bible has
shaped the way that I have lived my
life, whether conducting my business
as a dentist in Woodville, Texas, rais-
ing my family, or serving the good peo-
ple of the 36th District of Texas right
here in the House of Representatives.
I believe that the Bible is more than
a book of inspiration and comfort or a
compilation of moral teachings. I be-
lieve that it really is the Holy Word of
God that contains the truth and teach-
ings of His love for us and His plan for
redemption through faith in Jesus
Christ, His Son.
In history’s greatest love story, the
Bible tells us that God sacrificed His
Son to redeem us from depravity. In
John 3:16, we read: ‘‘For God so loved
the world, He gave His only begotten
Son that whosoever believeth in Him
should not perish but have everlasting
life.’’
Centuries before, in one of my favor-
ite passages, the Book of Job proph-
esied of Christ the Redeemer who is to
come:
For I know that my Redeemer lives,
And He shall stand at last on the Earth;
And after my skin is destroyed, this I know,
That in my flesh I shall see God,
Whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes
shall behold, and not another.
How my heart yearns within me.
Whenever I read these words, I am re-
minded of my Lord’s steadfast love for
me and His promise to always be with
and guide me through every chapter of
my life.
b 1800
As we approach the 78th National
Bible Week, I want to encourage my
fellow Americans out there to take a
moment to open the Bible and to read
these profound words. No matter if it
has been a while since you have read
the Bible or you read it every single
day, may each of us spend time remind-
ing ourselves of the Word of God, espe-
cially during this season of thanks.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Texas for sharing
his heart with us tonight.
Throughout American history, many
of our great leaders have turned to the
Bible for guidance, faith, and hope.
President Abraham Lincoln once said
of the Bible: ‘‘I have but to say, it is
the best gift God has given to man. All
the good the Savior gave to the world
was communicated through this book.
But for it we could not know right
from wrong. All things most desirable
for man’s welfare, here and hereafter,
are to be found portrayed in it.’’
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON), as
we go across the country and hear from
folks all over this great country of
ours.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I thank my brother in the
Lord from Colorado for hosting this
Special Order tonight, during a special
week where we commemorate the Holy
Word, the Bible.
Mr. Speaker, since 1941, every Presi-
dent since Franklin Delano Roosevelt
has declared the week of Thanksgiving
as National Bible Week.
It is fitting that we celebrate this
week along with the national day of
Thanksgiving. Both the Bible and this
annual holiday provide us with the
time to reflect on what is most impor-
tant in our lives: our faith, our creator,
our family, and our love for one an-
other.
Mr. Speaker, part of my family lin-
eage can be traced back to those Pil-
grims who set out for the New World in
search of religious freedom. They en-
dured both hardship and sacrifice at a
heavy cost to be able to freely worship
without persecution.
Forty-five of the 102 Mayflower pas-
sengers died in the winter of 1620 to
1621, and the Mayflower colonists suf-
fered greatly during their first winter
in the New World from lack of shelter,
scurvy, and general conditions of hard-
ship. They brought with them, though,
their faith and several Bibles.
The event that Americans commonly
call the First Thanksgiving was cele-
brated by the Pilgrims after their first
harvest in the New World in October of
1621. This feast lasted 3 days, and, as
accounted by attendee Edward Wins-
low, it was attended by 90 Native
Americans and 53 Pilgrims.
Thanks to William Bradford’s jour-
nal, we have knowledge of how these
Pilgrims gave thanks. The question re-
mains as to whom and why did they do
this.
As people of faith, I would like to be-
lieve they were acting out the lessons
of the Bible, such as that found in
Psalm 107. This Scripture states the
theme of God’s loyal love and redemp-
tion. It is written for at the time of
Israel in exile.
Wandering and overwhelmed by cir-
cumstances, I could see why these
early Pilgrims could find solace in this
Scripture. They also found themselves
wandering and enduring hardship.
The Bible illustrated the power of
giving thanks to the Lord, the impor-
tance of assuming thankfulness as a
human attitude.
These words indicate not just a
knowledge of, but also a recognition
and a relationship through, the Word of
God that the Bible offers.
I don’t know if the Pilgrims ref-
erenced this Scripture in preparing or
dealing with the hardships that they
endured. I do know that the Bible and
the Word within it was important to
these travelers and early settlers.
The Bible has had a tremendous in-
fluence in my life and the lives of mil-
lions of Americans. The Scriptures in-
side serve as a guide for us in both
times of trouble and in times of tri-
umph. And, for that reason, it remains
the best-selling book of all time.
During this week, I am thankful for
the strong community of faith that I
have come to know through weekly
Bible studies and prayer service here in
the United States Capitol and, cer-
tainly, back in my district and my
home community. It is a time where
we put aside differences and come to-
gether to share the love and the Gospel
of Jesus Christ.

nations, and even politicians as we

As I prepare to close, let me share
these thoughts.
God chose Israel; America chose God;
and God’s first love is Israel. Let’s

Mr. Speaker, let us also celebrate the
First Amendment, which affirms our
right to choose and exercise faith with-
out government coercion or retalia-
tion.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Pennsylvania for
his words, and I thank him for remind-
ing us about the Pilgrim tradition, es-
pecially as we enter this week of
Thanksgiving.
It is interesting, in American his-
tory, we have two different strains of
life going on in this country: We had
people starting in Jamestown looking
for gold, looking to make money, put-
ting up with slavery; but we had people
in Massachusetts who wanted to just
have religious freedom, and they had a
whole different view of the world and of
God and the Bible. They were the start
of the abolitionist movement. So I am
glad that Mr. THOMPSON brought us the
Pilgrim tradition tonight.
Ronald Reagan, when he designated
National Bible Week, said, when he was
in office: ‘‘When I took the oath of of-
fice, I requested the Bible be opened to
II Chronicles 7:14.’’
CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS men-
tioned this earlier. It reads: ‘‘If my
people, which are called by my name,
shall humble themselves, and pray, and
seek my face, and turn from their
wicked ways, then I will hear from
Heaven, and will forgive their sin, and
will heal their land.’’
This passage expresses my personal
hopes for the future of this Nation and
the world.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Kansas (Mr. ESTES).
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I thank my
friend and fellow colleague from Colo-
rado, Representative LAMBORN, for
hosting this Special Order tonight as
we honor National Bible Week.
Every President since Franklin Dela-
no Roosevelt inaugurated the first one
in 1941, every President has since de-
clared the week of Thanksgiving as Na-
tional Bible Week. It follows a long
history, stretching back to the found-
ing of our country, of our leaders turn-
ing to their faith and the Bible as guid-
ance for our Nation.
This is just as important now as it
was at our country’s founding and in
the midst of terrible world wars.
This week, I am reminded of a pas-
sage in Luke 17, verses 5 through 6:
‘‘The apostles said to the Lord, ‘In-
crease our faith.’ The Lord replied, ‘If
you have the faith the size of a mus-
tard seed, you would say to this mul-
berry tree, ‘‘Be uprooted and planted in
the sea,’’ and it would obey you.’’’
And also in Luke 17, verse 10, ‘‘So it
should be with you. When you have
done all you have been commanded,
say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we
have only done our duty.’’’
In this passage, Jesus’ apostles plead
for more faith to make it easier for
them to sacrifice and to do all that
they have been asked to do. But Jesus
answers them by pointing out that, if
they had only the tiniest bit of faith—
that, the size of a mustard seed—no
task would be too difficult. This in-
cluded even the apostles’ seemingly
impossible task to ‘‘go out and make
disciples of all nations.’’
But instead of increasing the meas-
ure of their faith, Jesus tells his apos-
tles to humble themselves and be
steadfast in accomplishing all that was
asked of them.
As public servants and representa-
tives, I believe we, too, are called to
humble ourselves and to be unwavering
in serving our fellow Americans. The
American people have put their trust
in us to preserve our democracy, pro-
tect our God-given rights, defend our
country, and champion the American
Dream. This is not an easy task. But,
as Jesus pointed out, anything is pos-
sible if we humble ourselves, do our
job, and have faith.
I know for me, personally, I rely on
teachings like this one in the Bible to
better serve my fellow Kansans and our
country.
I am also thankful to live in a coun-
try where we are free to practice our
faith, as well as to all the Americans
who have served to protect this free-
dom.
As we approach National Bible Week,
I hope my colleagues and all Ameri-
cans, regardless of their faith back-
ground, take some time to reflect on
their own calling to serve, as well as
the gift of religious liberty.
Like the Bible, public service and re-
ligious liberty are cornerstones of our
country, and I am honored to recognize
those here tonight and throughout Na-
tional Bible Week.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Kansas, in the Na-
tion’s heartland, for sharing his
thoughts with us tonight. I am going to
share my own story.
When I was a freshman at the Univer-
sity of Kansas—also there in America’s
heartland—in the 1970s, someone ap-
proached me and asked me if I knew
what the Bible was about. I said: Yeah,
sure I know what is in it.’’
But do you know what? I said that
without ever having read any of it for
myself. Kind of presumptuous on my
part.
Mr. Speaker, I wonder if there are
any people listening in here to us today
who are in the same position. Maybe
they think they know what it is about,
but they have never looked at it for
themselves.
The only honest thing I could do at
that point was to read for myself. So I
read the Gospel of John, and as I read
it, I discovered that I didn’t know what
was in there at all. It was totally dif-
ferent than what I had expected.
And I found a man in there who said:
‘‘I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one comes to the Father but
through me.’’ So I ended up discovering
for myself a relationship with Jesus
Christ, who became my Lord and Sav-
ior.
Mr. Speaker, that is what I know
from personal experience. It is better
to read the Bible for oneself and not
just take someone else’s word for it.
For me, it made all the difference in
the world. My life has been totally dif-
ferent as a result.
As David said in Psalms: ‘‘The un-
folding of your words gives light; it
gives understanding to the simple’’—
Psalm 119:130.
So, as we celebrate National Bible
Week, we remember the importance of
faith in both our private and our public
lives. We recognize the Bible’s powerful
message of hope. We cherish the wis-
dom of the Bible, and we thank God for
providing this holy book that has truly
been, in the words of Scripture, a lamp
unto our feet and a light unto our path.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Iowa (Mr. KING), another person
from the heartland of America.
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Colorado for
yielding to me and for leading here on
this National Bible Week.
I would like to start out with just a
touch of levity, because we are called
to address the Speaker, and I know
that the Speaker happens to also be a
man of God and a Bible scholar.
In addressing the Speaker, I enjoy re-
visiting Ecclesiastes 10:2, which says:
‘‘A wise man’s heart is at his right, but
a fool’s heart at his left.’’
I couldn’t resist that, and I pray that
you forgive me, Mr. Speaker, for that
bit of levity at this time.
I would move on to my favorite
verse, which is Ecclesiastes 9:10:
‘‘Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do
it with thy might.’’
It calls us not to just wander through
this life and touch things gently and
kind of let the flow of life go by, but we
are given gifts by God. He fills us with
skill sets that we haven’t yet devel-
oped, whether it is intellectual, wheth-
er it is physical, but skill sets of the
heart, and to put our vigor to those
things that please Him.
So with that verse in mind each
morning, I pray that God will loan me
the measure of his wisdom, that He
would have me use this day to go forth
and glorify Him. And if there is time
for a little extra blessing, let me do so
with joy. That sustains me through
every day.
Another verse that sustains me
through these future days came to me
this morning at our gathering. This is
the first chapter of Jeremiah, verse 17,
that says: ‘‘Meet them undaunted, and
they shall have no power to daunt
thee.’’
That says, in my vernacular, never
let them see you sweat, but go forth
with courage and with confidence. Do
those things that God calls you to do,
and do so with your might.
I also look back on a verse in James
that has caught my eye for some time,
VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:38 Nov 21, 2019 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00046 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K20NO7.094 H20NOPT1

and it calls us, I think, in the right
way, Mr. Speaker: ‘‘Count it all joy,
my brothers, when you meet trials of
various kinds, for you know that the
testing of your faith produces stead-
fastness. And let steadfastness have its
full effect, that you may be perfect and
complete, lacking in nothing.’’
That fits with a prayer that I offered
for years when we went through the
farm crisis years of the 1980s. Things
were falling down around us. The econ-
omy had essentially collapsed, and my
neighbor’s farms were being sold week-
end after weekend in farm sales.
I was being tested in a similar way
myself. Each day, I would pray that
God would be finished testing me and
start to use me.
b 1815
And we should take joy in that test
before we are made perfect in the tests
that He provides for us. I know they
are in the Book of James, which is one
that has stood out for me for a long
time, and that is: If you fail to do what
you know is right, then you have
sinned.
And I recall an issue that was going
on in the Iowa State legislature. I was
here in Congress, but I needed a bill in-
troduced and moved in the State legis-
lature. There were those who knew it
was the right thing to do, but they
didn’t have the courage to introduce it
because leadership was pushing against
them, and it was going to be a big po-
litical fight.
But I found a young man who is my
State representative today, and when I
raised the issue with him, he said: I
will do this. And I said: You understand
the burden of this and the potential
consequences if you step forward in
this arena?
And he looked at me and he said: If I
don’t introduce this bill, I will not be
able to receive final absolution.
Whoa, that told me something about
the man and the character and the
faith of this man. I don’t know if this
verse in James was something that had
been branded on his heart. The mean-
ing of it was—the words, I don’t know—
but he had to be thinking, if he failed
to do what he knew was right, then he
would have sinned.
But he stepped forward and did what
he knew was right. And I appreciate
Mr. LAMBORN, the gentleman from Col-
orado, speaking today about Western
civilization and about the foundation
of Western civilization. It is every-
where where the footprint of Judeo-
Christianity laid the foundation, this
Western civilization. The values in it
are rooted in the Old and the New Tes-
tament.
America would not and could not be
the great Nation it is today if we were
not a nation that was rooted in Bib-
lical values. And I think that is some-
thing indisputable.
Mr. Speaker, I want to bring some-
thing to the attention of this Congress
and people across this country that not
a lot of people know. And this was in
Jamestown in 1607. When they landed
at Jamestown, the first thing that the
settlers did as they arrived there, they
erected a cross. They knelt. They took
Communion, and they prayed.
The prayer is so profound, Mr. Speak-
er, that it should be hanging on the
walls or somewhere around this Con-
gress, and I don’t know that it is. But
here is their prayer, 1607, in this New
World:
‘‘We do hereby dedicate this land,
and ourselves, to reach the people
within these shores with the Gospel of
Jesus Christ, and to raise up godly gen-
erations after us, and with these gen-
erations take the Kingdom of God to
all the Earth. May this Covenant of
Dedication remain to all generations,
as long as this Earth remains, and may
this land, along with England, be Evan-
gelist to the world. May all who see
this cross remember what we have done
here, and may those who come here to
inhabit join us in this covenant and in
this most noble work that the Holy
Scriptures may be fulfilled.’’
If that doesn’t speak to the American
destiny, I don’t know what does. It had
to be the hand of God on them. There
is no way a mortal would have under-
stood the path that they were all to
follow and all that follow them.
I appreciate the opportunity to ad-
dress this topic, Mr. Speaker.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman. Many of the early
American settlers, we reference them
many times. They came to the New
World with the express purpose of fol-
lowing the Bible according to the con-
victions of their own consciences.
One of the first acts of Congress dur-
ing the tumultuous beginning of our
Nation was the authorization of an
American published Bible. The war
with the British had cut off any supply
of Bibles from England.
Our Founding Fathers understood
how important it was for the American
people to have Bibles. Robert Aitken, a
private citizen, brought this need to
the attention of Congress. In his letter,
he wrote: ‘‘This work is an object wor-
thy the attention of the Congress of
the United States of America, who will
not neglect spiritual security, while
they are virtuously contending for
temporal blessings.’’
So in 1782, Congress reviewed, ap-
proved, and authorized the first known
English language Bible to be printed in
America. They passed a congressional
resolution. I am not sure how many
votes this would get if we brought this
today. I know I would support it.
‘‘Resolved: That the United States in
Congress assembled, highly approve the
pious and laudable undertaking of Mr.
Aitken, as subservient to the interest
of religion, as well as an instance of
the progress of the arts in this country,
and being satisfied from the above re-
port of his care and accuracy in the
execution of the work, they rec-
ommend this edition of the Bible to the
inhabitants of the United States, and
hereby authorize him to publish this
recommendation in the manner he
shall think proper.’’
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON).
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I
want to thank my colleague, Mr. LAM-
BORN, my brother in Christ, and one of
our spiritual leaders here in this great
Chamber.
I so appreciate the gentleman leading
this effort to pay tribute to God’s holy,
inherent, infallible, active Word, that
Word that has created the heavens and
the Earth. The Word that became flesh
and dwelt among us in the person of
Jesus, God’s Son.
This Word of God, this Bible that we
speak of, I don’t know that there is any
book that has had a greater influence
on the world. It is no accident that the
words behind me above our Speaker
and our Nation’s motto are ‘‘In God we
trust.’’ And as we trusted God, God
blessed us.
As I trust Him in my life, He blesses
me. And when I depart as His child, as
a follower of Jesus, and I say to Mr.
LAMBORN that I have to confess, I de-
part from time to time. And when I do,
I don’t have that peace that surpasses
understanding, that hope and that joy
unspeakable, but because of this great
gift of the Bible, I cannot only know
the will of God, the mind of God, the
character of God, I can actually have a
relationship with God.
And that is mind-blowing. And the
fact that I wouldn’t run to the Bible
every day first thing when I get up, and
I wouldn’t cling to it at night, every
night, before I went to bed, is also
mind-boggling, knowing the power and
the richness, the depth of the wisdom
of God in those Holy Scripture.
And one of my favorite things to talk
about back home is—and I do this often
with school children—I talk about
what has made America great. Because
like all of us, they have heard that
statement over the last couple of
years, and they, I am sure, have pon-
dered that question. What has made
America great? And how do we make
America great again?
Well, I say America is great because
America is free. And no other Nation in
all of the world has been gifted with
that freedom like the United States.
And I say America is great because
America is brave. It is the 1 percent in
every generation that is willing to sac-
rifice everything for these liberties and
the opportunities that we are blessed
with. But, ultimately, what makes
America great is the goodness of Amer-
ica.
Alexis de Tocqueville who set out to
study what makes America great, said
these words, and I think they are im-
portant for us to reflect on. He was a
French philosopher. He came over here
for a year, kind of a sabbatical, and his
thesis was: What makes America
great?
He said: ‘‘I sought for the greatness
and genius of America in her commo-
dious harbors and her ample rivers—
and it was not there . . . in her fertile

fields and boundless forests and it was
not there . . . in her rich mines and her
vast world commerce—and it was not
there . . . in her democratic Congress
and her matchless Constitution—and it
was not there. Not until I went into the
churches of America and heard her pul-
pits aflame with righteousness did I
understand the secret of her genius and
power. America is great because she is
good, and if America ever ceases to be
good, she will cease to be great.’’
So I say this from my own personal
perspective in my own life, and I say
this to this great Chamber and to this
amazing country we have been blessed
to live in; we must return to the Bible
and our relationship with God, so His
goodness, through the power of the
Holy Spirit will flow through us, so we
can love our neighbors, serve our com-
munities, and we can make America
great again.
Amen. God bless America. And I
thank the gentleman for this great op-
portunity to share in this tribute to
the Bible, God’s Holy Word.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Representative ARRINGTON for his
heartfelt comments and for being here
tonight and sharing with us.
One reason many people respect the
Bible is that so many prophecies for
telling future events have come true
exactly as foretold. It is one of the rea-
sons I look at whenever I ask myself: Is
the Bible really true? Is it just a collec-
tion of stories and legends, or is it
rooted in history and fact?
So when I look at the prophesies of
the Bible, that gives me the answer. In
the Old Testament, there are many
predictions that were given to prove
that the speaker who claimed to be di-
vinely inspired really was or not. If,
and when, those predictions or proph-
esies came true, it validated the words
of that speaker.
In the Book of Daniel, for instance,
there are scores of detailed prophesies
that were literally fulfilled. So skep-
tics who want to criticize the Bible
have fallen back on the position that
Daniel must have been written of after
the facts about which they talk about.
But, the Book of Daniel is found in
its entirety in the Greek Septuagint
and partially in the Dead Sea Scrolls,
which were discovered in later years
and now we know predated the events
that were talked about in the Book of
Daniel. So Daniel gave prophesies that
came true in history.
So the critics of the dating of the
Book of Daniel are the ones who are
not being honest. The rise and fall of
empires, the capture and destruction of
cities, the destiny of kings, all of these
are prophesied about in minute detail,
and history has literally confirmed
hundreds of such prophesies as having
come true.
So that is one of the reasons I believe
in the Bible and know it to be true, and
not just a nice collection of stories.
I yield to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. ALLEN).
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in honor of National Bible Week
and thank Congressman LAMBORN for
the time tonight to recognize the im-
portance of honoring God’s Word.
As was said, 7 or 8 years ago, FDR de-
clared National Bible Week just before
the start of World War II. Just as it
was then, the Bible is God’s gift to us,
standing the test of time, and serving
as our guide during times of both joy
and hardship. It is the way that God
speaks to us.
I was born in rural America in Geor-
gia and as most youngsters, I was bap-
tized at an early age because I believed
in John 3:16:
That God who gave us his Son, His begot-
ten Son, that who shall ever believe in Him
shall not perish but have eternal life.
What an amazing gift.
And almost 20 years ago—and of
course, there are many highs and lows
during my time since then—but some
20 years ago, in one of those times of
despair, I made a covenant with God.
And that covenant was to put Him
first.
And that meant an intense study of
His Word. And He actually showed me
how to change my priorities and put
Him first because I had this thirst for
His Word as soon as I got up in the
morning. In fact, I would wake up and
I would be quoting His Word because of
something I thought of during the
night.
I learned that my strength and abili-
ties did not come from myself, but
through Him, and Him alone.
b 1830
In this great country, we pride our-
selves on freedom, and that freedom is
knowing that God is our strength and
His grace has no limits.
I often pray that thy kingdom come
on Earth as it is in Heaven, and the
Bible reveals to us that we already
have a glimpse of what that is like.
Genesis 1:26 through 28 shows us that,
from creation, we were all made in
God’s image and likeness. Now,
wouldn’t the world be a much better
place if we treated each other, our rela-
tionships, as if we were with God him-
self in those relationships.
Our country’s very foundation comes
from Judeo-Christian values, and these
principles are woven throughout our
founding documents.
The Bible says we were created for
God’s purpose and God’s image and in
His likeness.
If we study His Word and put it into
action to value all people, even those
we disagree with, I am certain that the
division and hurt in this country would
heal.
We are a divided nation, and we have
a divided government. You know, Jesus
prayed for us in John 17:21 that we
would be one, just as He and the Father
are one.
The enemy divides; God unites. And
if we trust God, as His word says—and
just above me, above the flag, says, if
we put our trust in God, it would unite
all of us here around those important
issues that our Founders and the Amer-
ican people care about.
I believe that if we actually, in this
Chamber, debated what the Scriptures
say about the very issues that divide
us—and they are very divisive issues
that we deal with on this floor every
day—if we took the Scriptures and de-
bated what the Scriptures say about
those issues, that we would all come to
agreement that God is correct and that
his way is the only way.
In fact, his instruction in Joshua 1:8
was: ‘‘Do not let this book of law de-
part from your lips. Be careful to do
what it says; meditate on it night and
day, and we will be prosperous and suc-
cessful.’’
America stands as a beacon of hope
for the rest of the world and can truly
be a shining city upon a hill that God
described if we treat each other with
the dignity and respect that God shows
us how to do through His Word.
I pray that God gives me the strength
and humility to serve Georgia’s 12th
District so that more people come to
know and love Christ, the truth, so
that the truth will set us free.
God bless America. God bless His
great Word.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Georgia for his
words and for being here tonight.
We have been on the Pacific Coast.
Now we are with Georgia on the Atlan-
tic Coast. We have been hearing from
Texas, people from Texas down at our
Mexican border, and we are about to
hear from someone from Wisconsin, our
border with Canada in the north of our
country. And as Mr. GROTHMAN comes
forward, I want to just say a word
about archaeology.
It is a historical fact that there are
archaeological discoveries that have
validated accounts in the Bible, which
gives trustworthiness to the Bible that
we acknowledge during this National
Bible Week.
Time and time again, archaeology
has shown that Biblical personalities,
locations, and events actually existed
in time and space. They weren’t just
made-up stories.
Claims by critics that a Bible state-
ment was simply made up have been
debunked by later archaeological dis-
coveries more times than we can say.
The Jewish archaeologist Nelson
Glueck has said: ‘‘It may be stated cat-
egorically that no archaeological dis-
covery has ever controverted or con-
troverted a Biblical reference.’’
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN).
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
to address National Bible Week.
The Bible is very important in this
country. In part, it is important be-
cause it is the Word of God, and that
makes it the most important book, but
it is a particularly important book in
America, and it is a book that every-
body should familiarize themselves
with because I don’t think you can un-
derstand either the Declaration of
Independence or our Constitution with-
out reading the Bible.
You have to remember what America
was like in its founding and probably

November 20, 2019
at least the first 125 years after its
founding. People learned to read by ei-
ther learning to read the Bible itself or
maybe learning to read another book,
such as ‘‘The New England Primer,’’
which had many excerpts from the
Bible in it, or ‘‘McGuffey’s Fourth
Reader,’’ which had 10 chapters, which
were solely parts of the Bible and also
included the Sermon on the Mount.
The Puritans, of course, who were
such an important factor in the found-
ing of America, encouraged everyone to
read the Bible. In 1782, the U.S. Con-
gress even commemorated an Amer-
ican Bible. The reason they commemo-
rated an American Bible is, at that
time, there was somewhat of a crisis in
America. We had a Revolutionary War
going on. It was difficult to get Bibles
from England. So somebody else had to
get a Bible or they had to get Bibles in
other ways, and Congress talked about
that. But when you think about that,
you realize why, for so many early
Americans, the Bible was so important
to them.
It is kind of funny nowadays where
they pretend that there is a separation
between church and state in America,
because John Jay, who was the first
Chief Justice of the United States, was
also president of the American Bible
Society; and I could go on at length
from early Supreme Court decisions in
which they talked about the impor-
tance of God and made reference to the
Bible.
Other important Americans early on,
Andrew Jackson, the Bible is ‘‘the rock
on which our Republic rests.’’
We can take two things out of this:
First of all, we could remember that
the great Andrew Jackson felt the
Bible was very important, and, sec-
ondly, remind people—because a lot of
people around here don’t know it—that
we are a Republic.
Abraham Lincoln, of course, was
known as our greatest Biblical Presi-
dent. There are all sorts of lessons in
the Bible.
I think in First Samuel it is inter-
esting to read when the Lord did not
like Israel turning from Him and view-
ing Him as primarily their king over
Israel, but instead they wanted kind of
a strong central government under a
king—example one of many lessons
that I think our forefathers read when
they designed our wonderful country.
But in any event, I think, for Na-
tional Bible Week, what every one of us
should do is take some time to read the
Bible, particularly the parts of the
Bible in which Israel was formed, be-
cause I think it was very important for
our forefathers because they envisioned
our country as a country which would
be pleasing to God, and they wanted
the type of country that God would
love and bless. I think we have been
given that love and blessings not so
much because of the way we behave
today, but because of the faith of our
forefathers.
So, again, my encouragement for
whoever sits at home and listens to
this, maybe say: Can I read the book of
Deuteronomy or read First Samuel and
learn a little bit of the Bible, not only
the Bible for its own right, but to re-
member the type of books that were
being read by our forefathers when
they wrote our Constitution, when
they wrote our Declaration of Inde-
pendence, and those books which cre-
ated their view of the world.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Mr. GROTHMAN for his words tonight,
and I appreciate him being here.
Listen to what President Harry Tru-
man said during his address at the At-
torney General’s Conference on Law
Enforcement Problems: ‘‘The funda-
mental basis of this Nation’s law was
given to Moses on the Mount. The fun-
damental basis of our Bill of Rights
comes from the teachings which we get
from Exodus and St. Matthew, from
Isaiah and St. Paul. I don’t think we
emphasize that enough these days.’’
He continued: ‘‘If we don’t have the
proper fundamental moral background,
we will finally wind up with a totali-
tarian government which does not be-
lieve in rights for anybody except the
state.’’
Now, we have been hearing from peo-
ple from the Atlantic to the Pacific,
from the Canadian to the Mexican bor-
der. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER),
my friend and colleague from the Na-
tion’s heartland.
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman. It is great to be
here tonight.
I just came from the Library of Con-
gress, and there are a lot of books
there, but there is one book in par-
ticular that is there, and it is in the
homes of many American families
right now that I would call the most
dangerous book in the world.
It is a book that people are being put
in prison for just having possession of.
It is a crime in many nations for people
to own this book, to read this book.
There are thousands and thousands of
people in prison right now in other
parts of the world who are being tor-
tured and killed because they possess
this book.
I was reading earlier today about a
country where there are people in pris-
on who have friends who tear this book
up into little pieces, and they smuggle
it into the prison. And that person
takes them, and they piece together
those pages so that they can not only
read this book, but they can memorize
it. Because as one of the prisoners said:
‘‘Even though they can take the paper
away, they can’t take away what’s hid-
den in your heart.’’
And there is another story from an-
other country where parents, if they
have the privilege of getting one of
these books, it is so precious they read
it at night to their families and then
they hide it.
But the schools and the government
trick their children in playing a hide-
and-seek game, and they trick the chil-
dren into telling their teachers if their
parents have that book and where it is.
And they are given candy if they win
this ‘‘game,’’ and then, sadly, they re-
alize their parents are taken away to
prison camps as a result of that.
So what is this book that I think is
really one of the most dangerous books
in the world? It is the Bible. It is the
Bible. It is what we are commemo-
rating this week.
But why is it so dangerous? Why are
governments around the world so
threatened by it? It is because it is the
Word of God. I will say that again: The
Bible is the Word of God.
Now, that seems radical. I mean,
some people would view that as radical,
but people who have read this book,
whose lives have been transformed by
it, who have experienced the power of
it, who have been set free from difficul-
ties in their life and the chains of ei-
ther sin or the chains of bondage of a
government that is trying to oppress
them will tell you it is the most pre-
cious book in the world. And that is
why governments fear it, and that is
why people seek it, and that is why ev-
eryone should take advantage—espe-
cially in America—of reading it. That
is why it is such a popular book.
By far, it is the world’s most popular
book. There is no other book, fact or
fiction, which comes close. Most esti-
mates place the number of Bibles print-
ed each year at 100 million.
Mr. Speaker, 20 million Bibles are
sold each year in the United States
alone. The American Bible Society es-
timates that 9 out of 10 American
households—or almost 9—87 percent of
American households own a Bible. In
fact, they say the average American
family owns three Bibles.
My question tonight to all of us is:
Are we reading it?
Having a Bible and not reading it
would be just like being frustrated that
you need to go somewhere and having a
car in the garage but just not taking it
out, or complaining about the room is
so dark when you just don’t go over
and turn the light switch on, or having
no idea how to go somewhere when you
can just turn on your Google Maps on
your phone.
The Bible is the source of help; it is
the source of power; and it is the
source of direction in our lives—and it
is right there in our homes, too many
times, sadly, gathering dust.
In my own life, I started off going to
church with my parents as a child, but
I never read the Bible myself. It was
something, we used it on Sunday, and
the pastor would share a verse or two,
and that was it.
And then I went to camp when I was
13. It was a Youth for Christ Camp. I
learned that we could read the Bible
ourselves and how powerful it is to,
every day, start your day off reading
from God’s Word, talking to Him
through prayer, listening to Him
through prayer, and getting inspiration
and guidance for your life.
And it was a revolutionary idea, so I
started doing that when I was 13, con-
tinued that through my teenage years

to the present. And I can’t tell you
what a difference that has made in my
life.
Day after day, I would pick up the
Bible to read, maybe 15 minutes before
the schoolbus came, and what I read
that day would be something that later
on, a couple hours later, I would face at
school. Whether it would be something
dealing with one of my classmates or a
hard test or being sick, it doesn’t mat-
ter.
b 1845
They say the Bible is living and ac-
tive, and it really is. That is one thing
that makes it so special, because it is
very, very powerful.
There have been many instances in
my life where the Bible has made a dif-
ference for me. But I want to certainly
say the most important verse is not
just because it is the word of God; it is
because it points me to how I can have
a personal relationship with him. And
that is John 3:16.
I don’t know about you, but I love
football. Many times when you watch a
football game, somebody is holding up
a poster that says, ‘‘John 3:16.’’ I hope
you go and read what that says because
it is so powerful. It says, ‘‘For God so
loved the world.’’ That is what makes
this different than other religions. God
is a god of love, and because He loved
the world, He gave His one and only
Son that whoever believes in Him
should not perish but have eternal life.
It goes on and says, ‘‘For God did not
send his Son to condemn the world but
to save the world through him.’’
I believed that when I was 9 years
old, and I am so thankful to have the
privilege of knowing God and that God
has made a way for each one of us to
know that.
I would, this week, encourage all of
us to get our Bible off that shelf, dust
it off, open it up, and experience know-
ing God, hearing from Him, and receiv-
ing the hope, healing, and help that
only God can provide.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman from Missouri for her
passionate and powerful words.
Our last speaker now before we con-
clude our hour is from the great State
of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT).
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, John
Adams, our first Vice President, such a
prominent fixture within the Conti-
nental Congress, Declaration of Inde-
pendence, so important to our found-
ing, such a strong antislavery person-
ality—and he was very, very learned,
constantly reading—said: I have exam-
ined all the religions, and the result is
that the Bible is the best book in the
world.
Patrick Henry, who gave the stem-
winding speech that moved so many to
support the Revolution, said: The Bible
is a book worth more than all the other
books that were ever printed.
Benjamin Rush, also a Founder, a
dear friend of John Adams, said: ‘‘By
renouncing the Bible, philosophers
swing from their moorings upon all
moral subjects. . . . It is the only cor-
rect map of the human heart that has
ever been published.’’
And I love what C.S. Lewis said in his
book ‘‘The Case for Christianity.’’ He
was discussing dualism, this idea that
there are two equal forces in the uni-
verse and that they are at war, and we
don’t know how it is going to come
out.
He said there is a war going on, but
it is not between two equal forces. It is
between a master and a rebel, and we
happen to live in rebel-occupied terri-
tory. Basically, he goes on to say, can
you imagine being behind enemy lines
and getting a message from your home
headquarters and you don’t even pick
it up and read it?
Those of us who are Christians, we
believe that God gave us this book of
messages, just like C.S. Lewis said. Un-
fortunately, many don’t pick them up.
It is well known that Thomas Jeffer-
son, though he was not a deist, believed
the Bible, not all of the miracles. But
the story is told that he was coming
down—and CRS has verified he came to
church every Sunday here in the Cap-
itol. He usually rode his horse. When
Madison came every Sunday—he was
here in D.C.—he came down to the Old
House Chamber.
But someone asked Jefferson: Where
are you going this Sunday morning?
He said: I am going to church in the
Capitol.
He had a big Bible under his arm.
He said: But you don’t believe every-
thing they do.
He said: Sir, I am the highest elected
magistrate in this country. It is imper-
ative that I set the proper example.
I thank my friend for setting that
same proper example.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Texas for his
words, and I thank him and all the oth-
ers who have spoken here tonight from
all over this great country of ours for
their heartfelt comments.
It has been an honor and a pleasure
for me to commemorate National Bible
Week this evening. I am grateful to my
colleagues who joined me to honor, re-
spect, and commemorate the Word of
God.
Mr. Speaker, the prophet Isaiah,
thousands of years ago in this book
right here, the Bible, in Isaiah 40:8
says: ‘‘The grass withers, the flower
fades, but the word of our God stands
forever.’’ Those are powerful and true
words.
Civilizations have risen and fallen,
generations have come and gone, yet
here today, on November 20, 2019, we
are still celebrating the enduring Word
of God given to us starting thousands
of years ago.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

TRANSGENDER DAY OF
REMEMBRANCE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentlewoman from
Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY) is recog-
nized for 60 minutes as the designee of
the majority leader.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, before
I begin, I ask unanimous consent that
all Members may have 5 legislative
days to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material
on the subject of the Special Order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Massachusetts?
There was no objection.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in remembrance of Rita Hester, a
Black transgender woman killed in the
Massachusetts Seventh District, for
whom Transgender Day of Remem-
brance was established in 1999.
I rise today because, 20 years later,
many more lives continue to be stolen.
This year, we have been robbed of at
least 22 transgender people because of
hate, fear, and vitriol—22 souls, the
majority of whom are Black
transgender women; 22 people whose
families, friends, and partners are for-
ever marred by grief; 22 experiences of
secondhand trauma for transgender
people everywhere.
Among them we remember: Dana
Martin, Jazzaline Ware, Ashanti
Carmon, Claire Legato, Muhlaysia
Booker, Michelle ‘‘Tamika’’ Wash-
ington, Paris Cameron, Chynal
Lindsey, Chanel Scurlock, Zoe Spears,
Brooklyn Lindsey, Denali Berries
Stuckey, Tracy Single, Bubba Walker,
Kiki Fantroy, Jordan Cofer, Pebbles
LaDime ‘‘Dime’’ Doe, Bailey Reeves,
Bee Love Slater, Jamagio Jamar
Berryman, Itali Marlowe, and Brianna
‘‘BB’’ Hill.
May they rest in peace and power.
Today, we remember still others not
included on this list because their
missing persons reports remain
uninvestigated or because they are
misgendered and deadnamed after their
death because the people closest to
them refused to recognize their truths.
We remember those who die from pre-
ventable illnesses, poverty, and vio-
lence as a result of discrimination in
healthcare, employment, education,
and housing.
We remember transgender women
Johana Medina and Layleen Polanco,
victims of an unjust and cruel immi-
gration and criminal legal system.
Mr. Speaker, colleagues, the
transgender community deserves to be
seen safe and celebrated. However, due
to this administration’s policies that
continue to neglect, unfairly target,
and commit violence against them,
this is not the case.
However, so as not to define the
transgender community only by their
trauma, today, I also rise to lift the
talents and strengths of this commu-
nity.
I honor you, my transgender friends,
for your bravery to honor your truths,
for intentionally creating a beautiful
and rich community, and for being role
models as leaders of social change.

November 20, 2019
I stand before you committed to lis-
tening to your needs, to recognizing
and centering transgender lives, not
just today but every day, and to being
your partner in ending this devastating
crisis.
Last week, I introduced the People’s
Justice Guarantee, a resolution that
reaffirms our collective right to live
free from injustice. I rise today re-
solved in the fight to ensure our rights
to dignity, liberation, and justice—jus-
tice for transgender people, justice for
all in America.
Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to
yield to the gentleman from the great
State of California (Mr. TAKANO).
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman from Massachusetts
for yielding.
I know the gentlewoman has read the
names of the Black trans women who
were taken from us far too soon due to
bigotry, hatred, and transphobia that
is running rampant in our country, but
if she will permit me, I will also enter
their names. I will read them aloud. I
believe we should honor them not just
once but many times over.
So, I rise in honor of Dana Martin,
Jazzaline Ware, Ashanti Carmon,
Claire Legato, Muhlaysia Booker,
Michelle ‘‘Tamika’’ Washington, Paris
Cameron, Chynal Lindsey, Chanel
Scurlock, Zoe Spears, Brooklyn
Lindsey, Denali Berries Stuckey, Tracy
Single, Bubba Walker, Kiki Fantroy,
Jordan Cofer, Pebbles LaDime ‘‘Dime’’
Doe, Bailey Reeves, Bee Love Slater,
Jamagio Jamar Berryman, Itali Mar-
lowe, and Brianna ‘‘BB’’ Hill.
These are the names we know of
transgender and nonconforming people
who have been killed in America in the
year 2019, so far.
We cannot ignore this epidemic that
is plaguing the trans community. We
cannot forget their stories. We cannot
stop fighting to protect trans lives.
On this Transgender Day of Remem-
brance, we remember their names.
I would like to say also that I appre-
ciated that our Speaker met today
with actress and activist Ms. Ross, who
is quite a champion of transgender peo-
ple. Our Democratic Caucus chairman,
HAKEEM JEFFRIES, led a roundtable.
Many Members of Congress appeared at
that roundtable to listen to the needs
of the transgender community. I thank
them for showing their support today.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for those power-
ful words. Like the gentleman, I agree
that we cannot say those names
enough.
Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to
yield to the gentleman from the great
State of Missouri (Mr. CLEAVER).
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman for her work in this
area, which is desperately needed.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on
today’s Transgender Day of Remem-
brance.
For 20 years, November 20 has
marked a solemn day in the LGBTQ-
plus community. Vigils are held in
communities nationwide in honor of all
the transgender people who were sense-
lessly and dementedly killed for simply
being who they are.
I told my transgender friends and
families: Never seek to change who you
are. Be exactly who you are.
Transgendered women of color are es-
pecially vulnerable to violence and are
4.3 times more likely to become homi-
cide victims than all women, according
to the Human Rights Campaign.
This year alone, at least 22
transgender and gender-nonconforming
Americans have been killed in the
United States. Ninety-one percent of
them were Black women.
I am sad to say that three
transgender people of color were mur-
dered in the greater Kansas City area,
two in my congressional district.
Brooklyn Lindsey was a 32-year-old
Black transgender woman. Those who
knew her say she was intelligent, had a
good sense of humor, and was loved by
many. By many accounts, she was out-
going and happy. She enjoyed dancing,
helping others, and wanted to be a life
coach.
On June 25, she was found shot to
death on an abandoned porch in Kansas
City, Missouri.
b 1900
Jamagio Jamar Berryman, also
known as Ja’leyah Jamar, was 30 and a
Black gender nonconforming person.
Ja’leyah was passionate about fixing
and working on cars, designing hair,
and spending quality time with family.
They were shot and killed in Kansas
City, Kansas, on September 13. They
left behind a 5-year-old daughter
named Ja’Mya, their parents, seven
siblings, nieces and nephews, and many
others who loved them deeply.
And most recently, Brianna ‘‘BB’’
Hill was a 30-year-old Black
transgender woman who was fatally
shot in Kansas City, Missouri, on Octo-
ber 14. Brianna was a beloved member
of her community, a fan of the Kansas
City Chiefs, and loved spreading joy by
sharing funny videos on her Facebook
page.
The Department of Housing and
Urban Development has removed re-
quirements for applicants for homeless
funding maintain antidiscrimination
policies and demonstrate efforts to
serve LGBTQ-plus people and their
families.
The Department of Defense has im-
plemented a ban on transgender troops.
These are just a few instances that
shows that the United States of Amer-
ica—at least the administration—is in
the midst of a nervous breakdown.
Change is still needed to protect the
LGBTQ citizens nationwide.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the for gentle-
woman for allowing me to speak.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for those words
and for telling us more about those we
were prematurely robbed of all that
they had to contribute to this world. It
is important that we continue to bring
their names into this well, into this au-
gust institution, so that we are com-
pelled to continue to do this work, un-
derstanding that this is—behind every
number—this is not about statistics.
These are about people, people of flesh
and bone who loved and were loved.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from the great State of New
Jersey (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN), my
friend and sister in service.
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr.
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for
yielding to me and for leading in this
Special Order hour.
Mr. Speaker, I stand here tonight to
remind my colleagues and the world
that our transgender community needs
us.
Bigotry, hate, and violence against
transgender people has reached a level
that requires a whole day devoted to
simply remembering everyone who has
lost his or her life. This year alone,
over 300 have been murdered.
That is to say nothing of the
transgender people who were bullied or
harassed to the point of taking their
own lives just simply for accepting
every part of themselves.
There is no doubt in my mind that an
administration that has endorsed hate
at every turn and outright exclusion of
our transgender friends and family is
part of the problem. Our actions in this
body need to be part of the solution.
I am proud to be a part of the Equal-
ity Caucus Transgender Equality Task
Force, and I am determined to see us
continue to take real steps that will
protect the rights and the freedoms of
all people.
As a founding chair of the Congres-
sional Caucus on Black Women and
Girls, I am committed to recognizing
the value and need of our transgender
sisters.
As the chair of the CBC’s Emergency
Task Force on Black Youth Suicide
and Mental Health, I am actively work-
ing to ensure transgender youth re-
ceive the support and the care and the
love to overcome the hate of our soci-
ety.
This is a community in dire need,
and I join my colleagues and so many
others in stepping up and speaking out.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for the opportunity to speak.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for her leader-
ship and for always fighting for those
too often ignored, left out, and left be-
hind. We are grateful for her.
Now, just as I close, as we wrap this
Special Order hour, Transgender Day of
Remembrance is about remembering
lives we have lost too soon, but it
should also be about remembering the
bravery of transgender people every-
where. I rise again to acknowledge the
contributions, often overlooked, of
transgender women of color who have
been champions of social change.
It was transgender advocates in my
district who established the first
Transgender Day of Remembrance in
1999 in honor of Rita Hester, a Black

transgender woman described as viva-
cious, outgoing, and loved by many
people.
On this day, I rise to remember the
transgender women of color who were
catalysts for the LGBT rights move-
ment in the United States and around
the world. We remember the bravery of
Miss Major Griffin-Gracy and the late
Sylvia Rivera, and Marsha P. Johnson
in the face of the police who violently
raided the Stonewall Inn in New York
City in 1969, detaining and arresting
people simply for being themselves.
When faced with compounded
transphobia, racism, sexism, and
homophobia, transgender people have
marched and resisted. When confronted
with structural barriers, transgender
people have organized and advocated.
I remain committed, along with the
dedicated members of my team—and I
want to issue a special thanks to Jenny
Curt for her contributions to today’s
Special Order hour—committed not
only to lifting the stories of those lives
lost, but to working in partnership,
legislating boldly. I see their power; I
honor their activism.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

NATIONAL TRANSGENDER DAY OF
REMEMBRANCE
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
DEAN). Under the Speaker’s announced
policy of January 3, 2019, the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. GARCÍA) is
recognized for the remainder of the
hour as the designee of the majority
leader.
GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, before I begin, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous materials on the subject of the
Special Order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois?
There was no objection.
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, first of all, I would like to
thank Representative PRESSLEY for
dedicating this time in honor of the
Transgender Day of Remembrance and,
of course, naming many of the victims
of violence who have met this fate sim-
ply for being who they are. As a mem-
ber of the Equality Caucus, I am proud
to call her my colleague and my friend.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN).
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. And I rise tonight
with a degree of sadness because we
have this day, this national
Transgender Day of Remembrance.
It is a sad thing such that you have
to have an occasion such as this. You
should never have to set aside time an-
nually to remember those who have
lost their lives to violence. But because
it happens, we must be here.
What Dr. King reminds us was right
then and is right now: ‘‘Injustice any-
where is a threat to justice every-
where.’’ Injustice against the trans
community is a threat to every com-
munity.
It seems that murder of Black
transgender women is becoming almost
a crisis in this country. Fatal
antitransgender violence in the United
States is on the rise, and most of the
victims are Black transgender women:
the largest number of transgender
homicides, a record number in 2017, 29
killed; last year, 26 killed, most of
them Black.
Why is this happening? Well, one rea-
son might be because this administra-
tion tends to promote a narrative that
marginalizes people who are already
being marginalized. Such a narrative
has a means of trickling down.
The tone and tenor of society is set
by those at the top. Those at the top
have to be mindful of the messages
that they send.
So I am honored to observe this day,
and I would like to speak very tersely
about someone whose story cannot be
told in 5 minutes.
Itali Marlowe was my constituent.
She was found in the driveway of a
local residence, shot multiple times,
the 19th trans person to die by violence
in our Nation this year. All but one of
these victims has been a trans woman
of color.
This day allows us to memorialize
those who have been murdered as a re-
sult of transphobia. But I pray for a
day when this day will no longer exist,
when all people will be accepted in a
society that proclaims liberty and jus-
tice for all.
INCOME INEQUALITY AND COLLECTIVE
BARGAINING RIGHTS
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, tonight, we find ourselves at
a troubling time for all workers across
the country: Income and wealth in-
equality are at an all-time high, and
union representation is at a historic
low. These facts mean that all workers
have a harder time making ends meet.
It is time to reset the balance of
power in our economy between working
people and corporate interests.
For decades, collective bargaining
rights have been under relentless as-
sault, especially by the Republican
Party, in an effort to disempower
working people and hand our democ-
racy to corporate America. Tonight, I
am proud to bring together my col-
leagues from the Congressional Pro-
gressive Caucus and our friends to talk
about the PRO Act.
The Protecting the Right to Organize
Act is a landmark step to restore the
rights of working people to join unions
and collectively fight for fair wages
and working conditions.
The PRO Act rebalances the scales
between workers and corporations by
enacting strong enforcement measures
against employers who violate labor
laws, strengthening the right to nego-
tiate and organize unions, and empow-
ering workers to report abuses of their
rights.
I thank my colleagues for joining me
to stand up for workers and their right
to organize.
I also want to recognize the true cre-
ators of wealth in our economy, the
working men and women of America.
To begin tonight’s deeper conversa-
tion, I call on a person who represents
a district that has been at the heart of
growing the economy and driving the
economy for average Americans over a
long period of time. He comes from
trade union organizing and represents
an overwhelmingly working-class dis-
trict in the great State of Michigan.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN).
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
I thank my colleague from the great
State of Illinois for organizing this spe-
cial session to talk about what I con-
sider to be the single most trans-
formative piece of legislation that we
are considering right now, the PRO
Act, the Protecting the Right to Orga-
nize Act.
And why would it be so trans-
formative? Because, as Representative
GARCÍA mentioned, inequality of
wealth and income has grown to pro-
portions we have not seen in 100 years
in this country.
From 1980 to 2014, income for the bot-
tom half of earners, the whole bottom
half of American workers, grew 1 per-
cent; whereas, income for the top 1 per-
cent grew 205 percent.
And why? Because workers have lost
all voice and power in this economy.
Workers do not have the freedom to
form unions.
At its high-water mark in the late
forties and early fifties, a third of
American workers had collective bar-
gaining, and they built the middle
class in this country over the post-war
decades. Today, 6 percent of workers in
the private sector—6 percent—have col-
lective bargaining, have unions, and so
they have no real ability to get their
fair share of the American pie and to
rebuild the American Dream.
The PRO Act would do so much to
change this.
Truly, it reminds me of my days or-
ganizing nursing home workers, kind of
a long time ago, in the 1980s, in Michi-
gan and Indiana and Massachusetts and
Rhode Island. It was so hard for work-
ers to form a union. Their employer
could do almost anything, and that is
true to this day.
b 1915
So, for example, your employer can
make you go in a room, and if you
refuse to attend, they can fire you. And
the sole purpose of the meeting is to
tell you how bad forming a union
would be for both of you. They can
make you individually go into their of-
fice and tell you that the union would
be a bad thing.
This kind of intimidation tactic has
led to a crisis in our economy. And peo-
ple like to talk about free markets and
capitalism. All I want to see is a free
market for worker organizing in this

country. And all the best research sug-
gests that if we really had one, about a
third of workers would, again, be in
unions, and it would completely trans-
form the economy.
So let me just hit a couple of the
things that the PRO Act would do that
would be so important.
First of all, it would recognize the re-
alities of the 21st century economy.
Workers could organize and bargain
with whatever companies share control
of their employment. So, hello, McDon-
ald’s franchises, hello, Courtyard by
Marriott. Any companies that have
franchises, both the franchisee and the
franchisor could be joint employers.
Employers could not prevent workers
from organizing and could not avoid
the responsibility for workers by
misclassifying them as independent
contractors. That is rampant in to-
day’s economy. Employers under the
PRO Act would not be able to just call
their workers supervisors willy-nilly to
deny them the right to organize. And
workers’ rights to organize would be
recognized in all the electronic formats
that we use to communicate today.
Another thing that is key is that at
long last, the PRO Act would end the
right to freeload, a disease that has
been spreading in this country since
the late 1940s that says that in our sys-
tem, even though a union has to rep-
resent all the employees in a work-
place, it prevents union employers
from negotiating contracts that simply
say that all the workers have to pay
their fair share for administering the
contract. We would end 60 years of ef-
forts to destroy the labor movement
simply by allowing what I learned in
law school as the freedom of contract.
An employer and a union are free to
negotiate that all the workers pay
their fair share.
The list of improvements in the core
area of an organizing campaign is real-
ly impressive. Just to pick a couple of
them.
Employers couldn’t gerrymander the
bargaining union to pick out who is for
or against the union, so to choose the
voters in a sense. Elections would have
to happen much faster. If a worker is
fired for organizing a union, as I saw
happen so many times, the NLRB
would have to go for an immediate in-
junction to get them reinstated. If the
workers felt intimidated by having an
election on the employer’s work site,
then the NLRB could have it at a neu-
tral location. So many commonsense
things just to allow workers to orga-
nize freely.
So let me just sum up and say, I
would love to talk about all the provi-
sions, but it would take me all night,
and I want to yield to my colleagues.
All we are asking for is that workers
in this country have their rights recog-
nized across the globe in the inter-
national labor organizations provisions
so that they can have freedom of as-
sembly, freedom to organize, and free-
dom to bargain a contract. And, Rep-
resentative GARCÍA, that would do
more to make our country more just
and beautiful than anything else we
could do.
Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to stand
up tonight for the PRO Act, and I
thank Representative GARCÍA for his
leadership in making this happen.
Mr. GARCÍA of ILLINOIS. Mr.
Speaker, I thank Representative LEVIN
for sharing that story, his own personal
knowledge and experience of working
to empower working people so that
they have good wages, good working
conditions and very critically what is
at the heart of the PRO Act, organizing
to have leverage to level the playing
field and to arrive at what is the best
contract for workers in a worksite set-
ting.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), who hap-
pens to be the chairman of the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor.
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker,
I join my colleagues to speak in sup-
port of H.R. 2474, the Protecting the
Right to Organize Act, or the PRO Act.
The PRO Act was reported out of the
Committee on Education and Labor on
September 25, and it is the most com-
prehensive legislation in recent history
to strengthen workers’ rights to orga-
nize and bargain for higher wages, bet-
ter benefits, and safer working condi-
tions.
Labor unions have long fueled our
Nation’s prosperity. Wage growth and
worker productivity rose steadily to-
gether when union membership was at
its peak, around 30 percent, between
the end of World War II and 1973. Union
members earn significantly higher sal-
aries, they are more likely to enjoy
better benefits and also much more
likely to work in a safe workplace.
This had the effect of creating an econ-
omy where most working families
could achieve a basic standard of liv-
ing. But unfortunately, in the last 4
decades, union membership has plum-
meted, and income inequality has
soared.
Despite the clear benefits of strong
unions, just one in 10 workers cur-
rently is a union member and only 6
percent of private sector workers are
union members.
Low union membership certainly
does not mean that American workers
have given up on unions. In fact, ac-
cording to a poll of workers across the
country conducted by the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology, 48 per-
cent of nonunion workers say they
would vote to join the union if given
the opportunity.
Regrettably, what is keeping workers
from joining unions are weak labor
laws, aggressive employer opposition
to unions, and relentless political at-
tacks that have dismantled workers’
rights to organize.
To that point, the PRO Act would
deter employers from violating work-
ers’ rights to form a union in five key
ways:
First, the PRO Act puts some teeth
into the law by authorizing civil mone-
tary penalties for companies that in-
flict serious economic harm on employ-
ees by violating the National Labor Re-
lations Act, in doing things such as fir-
ing union supporters for engaging in
protected activities. This would update
the current law, which provides no
civil penalties today for employers who
violate the NLRA, leaving no meaning-
ful deterrent for employers who choose
to violate workers’ rights.
Second, the PRO Act would stream-
line procedures and guarantee swift
remedies for workers. Currently, if
workers prove that they were unlaw-
fully fired for organizing, they may
have to wait years before being rein-
stated and receiving back pay. The
PRO Act would guarantee temporary
reinstatement for workers whose cases
are found to have merit while their
cases are being adjudicated. This would
also make the National Labor Rela-
tions Board orders immediately appli-
cable to all parties involved in pro-
ceedings, just like those of other Fed-
eral agencies.
Third, the PRO Act would protect the
integrity of union elections by pro-
viding remedies when employers inter-
fere with union representation elec-
tions. It also establishes mediation and
arbitration procedures to encourage
employers and unions to reach a first
collective bargaining agreement after
the union is formed.
Fourth, the PRO Act would mod-
ernize labor law by clarifying exactly
which employees and employers are
covered by the National Labor Rela-
tions Act. Too often employers
misclassify their employees as inde-
pendent contractors or anything but
employees. This tactic allows employ-
ers to avoid their legal obligations to
their workers. The PRO Act safeguards
against these practices and also pro-
tects workers’ First Amendment rights
to engage in peaceful picketing and
other free speech activities.
Finally, the PRO Act fosters trans-
parency, so employees know their
rights under the law. Other labor laws
require employers to post notices of
employee rights like Title 7 of the Civil
Rights Act, the Family Medical Leave
Act, and OSHA. The PRO Act will simi-
larly guarantee the employers notify
the employees of their rights.
At its heart this legislation is about
restoring workers’ rights to organize
and restoring balance to the economy.
By passing the PRO Act, we can take
an historic step towards improving the
quality of life for workers and families
across the country.
So I thank the Progressive Caucus
for sponsoring this Special Order and
giving us the opportunity to promote
the PRO Act.
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker,
I thank Representative SCOTT, who, of
course, is also the Chair of the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee. Part of
the reason why he knows so much
about the bill is he happens to be the
bill’s chief sponsor.
Mr. Speaker, we are going to hear
from another part of the country, and

H9114 November 20, 2019
we are going to the West Coast to get
a better understanding of why rep-
resentatives in this House from all over
the country are uniting behind this im-
portant piece of legislation.
Next, I yield to the gentleman from
California (Mr. TAKANO), who is a mem-
ber of the Congressional Progressive
Caucus and also chairs the Committee
on Veterans’ Affairs of the U.S. Con-
gress.
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Illinois for yield-
ing.
I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to join the
voices of the working men and women
of our country demanding better
wages, better working conditions, bet-
ter benefits. I rise for working families,
for those working multiple jobs and
struggling to get by while CEOs are
making multiple millions of dollars
and reaping the benefits of their labor.
And this is all during a time over the
past several decades where produc-
tivity of the American economy has
gone up while wages from those who
have created that productivity have
stayed flat. And if we want to achieve
income equality or less income in-
equality, the answer is in giving work-
ers leverage on the economy.
So I rise to defend workers’ rights,
their right to rise up in their work-
place and use their collective power to
demand better from their employer.
That is the leverage that I am talking
about.
Right now employers and corporate
interests are doing everything they can
to strip workers of their protections. In
fact, they have already done that. They
have already participated in weakening
our labor laws and made it more dif-
ficult for workers to organize. And
Representative LEVIN of Michigan
started to explain the complex ways in
which organizing is made more dif-
ficult; how elections can run forever;
and how employers have an unfair ad-
vantage in those elections; and how the
will of the workers in the workplace to
organize and unionize can be thwarted.
And once unions are formed, there
are many efforts to bust unions and si-
lence the voices of workers, which, let
me be clear, is illegal. And that is why
we need to pass the PRO Act to make
sure that penalties are enforced. We do
have laws on the books, but there is
not enough enforcement. We need to
put an end to these antiunion activi-
ties.
If we want to reduce economic in-
equality, support working people and
working families and ensure that the
American Dream is within reach for
all, then let’s pass this bill. It is time
to reaffirm our support for working
people in America.
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker,
I thank the gentleman from California.
Before we go to the East Coast and
hear the voices of working people there
and why they support the PRO Act, I
would like to share with you a brief
story about myself in Chicago.
When I was growing up in Chicago,
both of my parents were proud union
members. In fact, they were both
Teamsters. My father worked at a cold
storage facility, and my mother
worked at a candy factory on Chicago’s
West Side. Both relied on their union
jobs to raise our family, and they re-
tired on their union pensions, which
enabled them to purchase a com-
fortable home for their family.
There will be more stories from Chi-
cago, but right now I would like to go
to the East Coast and hear from an-
other member of the Progressive Cau-
cus. He hails from the State of New
Jersey. I yield to the gentleman from
New Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS).
Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to speak on the importance of
the Protecting the Right to Organize,
or as we know it, the PRO Act.
b 1930
We heard several of my colleagues
talk about the pros of what literally is
taking place and how difficult it is. As
many people know, and as we have
heard here, there are 218 lawyers in
Congress, but there is only one elec-
trician and one electrician who spent
his career not only doing the electrical
work but representing workers.
I have spent 37 years in the IBEW,
literally having to retire from that as
I came here and took my oath of office
to represent the people of the First
District.
When we look at what is happening
today in this country, it is the end of a
long line of abuses, those things that
have happened over the course of the
last three decades in particular, the de-
cline of union membership. Many of
those on the other side of the aisle like
to say that it is because people don’t
want it. This couldn’t be any further
than the truth.
Today, close to 80 percent of employ-
ees would vote for a union if they
could—80 percent. This is quite a dif-
ferent figure than the 6 percent that
you heard representing private employ-
ers, Mr. Speaker. That is because it has
been rigged. I can say that because I
am one of the few Members who speak
on this floor who have been to the Na-
tional Labor Relations Board and who
has conducted elections. I have done it
repeatedly. I see the cheating that
takes place. That is why we have the
PRO Act.
Earlier this year, we voted on some-
thing that I thought would have been
unanimous, the Raise the Wage Act.
The minimum wage in this country
hasn’t been raised in over 11 years—11
years—$7.25 an hour.
Tell me out there, can you live on
$7.25 an hour?
We change that.
Predictably, over the next 71⁄2 years,
that would raise to $15 an hour. But
our colleagues on the other side of the
aisle say: They don’t need a raise.
That is how unbelievable some of this
is. Tell me, can you live on that?
The PRO Act is simply listening to
the people whom we work with who
want a voice and who want to be able
to grow the business that they are
working for so that they can share in
those wages. That is where the PRO
Act comes in.
I mentioned I was an electrician, and
I still am. I am not doing much work
the way I used to, but as I told my
kids, I am an electrician with a tie
now. But I saw firsthand people who
would say: I want the chance to do bet-
ter. I want the chance for us collec-
tively to bargain.
They would come to see us and say:
Can you help me?
We said: Sure we can.
We gathered together, and we speak
with one voice, go to the NLRB, which
is the labor relations board that makes
the rules, and say: Here is a bargaining
group of 8 to 10 men and women who
want to become part of the IBEW, or
speak collectively as we call it. Then
the fight begins.
Occasionally, Mr. Speaker, you would
have a contractor who says: Do you
know what? After talking to them, I
think this is a good way of working to-
gether to try to grow my business and
to take care of my employees.
Unfortunately, for those who want to
cheat the system, they start to say:
Well, he is an independent contractor.
He just started here. He is an appren-
tice.
They try to break up the groups.
When they talk about bargaining
groups as my colleague, Mr. LEVIN,
talked about, it is about breaking that
apart.
All this does is level the playing field
and make it fair so those workers who
want to vote to collectively bargain
can do it in a fair and open way so the
elections aren’t rigged. Fair and open,
we hear that so much today.
The PRO Act protects workers be-
cause the other thing that the em-
ployer will do is fire the one who spoke
up: We will take care of the one who is
causing the trouble.
I am trying to do better for my fam-
ily, and I talked to my employer about
a raise, and he doesn’t want to do it, so
I call up the union and say: Can you
help me? And I get fired for that.
There is no recourse for bad actors.
The PRO Act would change that and
level the playing field so there are pen-
alties when you break the law. It is
like having speed limits with no police
on the road. That is what it is like
now. They are free to do whatever they
want.
The PRO Act restores the fairness of
the economy against those workers
who are rigged. Workers win, but just
as important, business wins. They grow
together. It is just not a one size fits
all. We understand working together is
what this does.
We see so often the tragedies of what
happened from the same crew who
won’t vote to raise the minimum wage
in 11 years and who are the same ones
fighting this.
Together, we can do better. Raise the
level of fairness so that all employees
will have a voice at their workplace.

Again, I thank the gentleman for
bringing us together. I look at my col-
leagues out here who understand this
on a gut level. To the Representatives
who are listening tonight, go home and
talk to the average guy on the street
and say: Do you want to make it bet-
ter, to raise your family, to have a de-
cent wage? Then you will hear yes.
I recommend voting ‘‘yes’’ for the
PRO Act.
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. I thank the
gentleman from New Jersey for sharing
that wonderful story.
Women in this body overwhelmingly
support the PRO Act for good reason.
The PRO Act would help level the play-
ing field and move all of us toward a
greater sense of economic justice.
This evening, we are very fortunate
to hear from a voice also from the East
Coast who will get to the crux of why
this is such an important tool for eco-
nomic justice in our country. She is a
member of the Progressive Caucus of
this body and someone who is pas-
sionate and compassionate about pro-
viding equal opportunity for everyone
in our country.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON
COLEMAN).
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank
the gentleman for yielding to me, and
I thank the gentleman for taking on
this Special Order hour and leading it.
Organized labor has always been the
foundation of good-paying jobs that
support a thriving middle class. That is
why it is vital that we support legisla-
tion like the PRO Act, finally empow-
ering the National Labor Relations Act
to do the important work of protecting
workers’ rights.
Since the day that law was enacted
in 1935, big businesses and their allies
in the Republican Party have worked
to weaken it. Their efforts have
brought us to a point where union
membership has cratered, and not coin-
cidentally, inequality has grown.
The PRO Act implements penalties
for employers who illegally fire work-
ers because they try to form a union or
are simply pro-union in their thinking.
Today, we see employers out in the
open on Twitter flagrantly violating
the NLRA and threatening their em-
ployees if they even think about form-
ing a union.
The PRO Act will allow workers to
stand up and say to their boss: Joining
together with my co-workers is right,
and you will not threaten me with cuts
to my hours, my pay, or my job.
This law will put an end to the prac-
tice of company bosses dragging their
feet in collective bargaining negotia-
tions in order to break the spirit of
workers and avoid their legal responsi-
bility to honor the wishes of their
workers.
The PRO Act also recognizes the
changing face of workers and ensures
that those working multiple jobs do
not lose their right to organize when
they change shifts.
The part of this bill that I find most
energizing is its protection of that
most fundamental right of workers, the
foundation of worker power from which
all labor power is derived, the right to
strike, the right to stand with your fel-
low worker and say: We will not accept
these conditions another minute. We
will not work another day until our de-
mands are heard and our rights are re-
spected.
The right to stand with your union
sisters and brothers and withhold your
labor is finally recognized under this
bill.
If workers can put their sweat into
building the greatest country in the
world, how dare we say to them that
they cannot join their fellow workers
to demand a fair share of what they
built?
This bill is the most important labor
rights bill in years, and today, I am
proud to be a member of the party of
the working men and women, the
Democratic Party, as we pass this bill.
I thank the gentleman for the oppor-
tunity.
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker,
if I could inquire how much time is re-
maining in the Special Order hour?
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
GREEN of Texas). The gentleman has 11
minutes remaining.
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Before I in-
troduce and as a prelude to the re-
marks that we will hear from the fol-
lowing speaker, I would like to share a
story about the great city that I hail
from and the great State that I rep-
resent here, the State of Illinois. It has
a proud labor history that is filled with
stories of courage and sacrifice by
workers striving to organize.
Since the 1800s, workers organized in
mines and factories fighting the abuses
of powerful industrial interests. Chi-
cago earned the reputation as a city of
big shoulders, a working-class and
hardworking city. Workers were killed
in the Haymarket massacre of 1886, a
struggle that led to the 8-hour day and
the end of child labor.
The country’s first national strike
started in Chicago when train workers
across the country joined a strike that
began in Pullman, Illinois. Federal
troops were sent in to break up the
Pullman Strike, but it was so signifi-
cant that Congress created Labor Day
shortly afterward.
One of the Nation’s most deadly mine
disasters happened in Illinois in 1909.
The tragedy prompted better enforce-
ment of child labor laws and advanced
the movement for workers’ compensa-
tion.
Working people joining forces in
unions helped lift up all workers across
the country.
With that opening remark, Mr.
Speaker, I would like to yield next to
the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.
POCAN), who also happens to be one of
the cochairs of the Congressional Pro-
gressive Caucus.
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the
gentleman very much for all the work
that he has done on behalf of his con-
stituents, the people of Chicago, and
really the people of the entire country.
I know this is the gentleman’s second
event today alone on behalf of workers,
and I thank the gentleman for his out-
spoken representation on behalf of peo-
ple who need a voice in Congress. I
think we heard earlier tonight there
are about 200-plus lawyers in this body.
A majority of Congress are million-
aires. Not to say that if you are a mil-
lionaire, you can’t empathize with
working people, but it is another thing
to come from a background like I do.
I had a union specialty printing shop,
a small shop for nearly three decades, a
member of International Union of
Painters and Allied Trades, IUPAT, for
nearly three decades.
I can tell you the benefits that have
happened for my family and the people
I work with by having good, union-sup-
porting wages and good, union-sup-
porting benefits and why that matters
so much.
The problem we have right now in
this country and the problem that we
have across so many States is an orga-
nized effort going after working people
by going after their ability to have a
voice in their workplaces by having
unions. We have watched attacks
across the country, including in my
home State of Wisconsin, where States
have gone to a so-called right-to-work
law. What that is often referred to as a
‘‘right-to-work-for-less’’ law because
when you get these laws often, on aver-
age, people lose over 3 percent in pay in
States that do this. But we have
watched those laws happen across the
country.
Federally, under the Trump adminis-
tration, we have watched laws that
make it harder for working people who
win the legal right to form a union,
through a union election. They run
into all kinds of stumbling blocks. All
too often, there is no legal recourse
against an employer who violates the
rules or stacks the deck against people
and doesn’t allow that vote to actually
form that union.
That is the real problem that we are
facing. That is what we are talking
about tonight with the PRO Act. That
is what we are trying to address in
Congress.
What I think is so very important to
raise is the reason people want to have
a union is because it will help not only
their family but their communities by
lifting up everyone. When you have a
union job, you are more likely to get
more pay and better benefits than peo-
ple who are not in union jobs.
That is why the public support is so
strong right now for unions with 64 per-
cent support for unions, one of the
highest percents we have seen in this
country. And 67 percent of people 18 to
34, millennials, even more than the
population as a whole, see this as a
way to have a voice in their workplace.

port: expanding union rights, banning

vote for a union, you should be able to
get a contract for your union—making
so-called independent contractors em-
ployees, and protections for workers on
strike.
All of those things I just mentioned
are included in the PRO Act. All those
things could be possible for workers
across the country.
We know that when we have had the
least amount of income inequality in
our country, back in the 1950s, is when
we had the greatest representation of
people in unions. Now that we have got
one of the smallest amounts of people—
about 11 percent, nationwide, in public
and private employee unions—we have
the greatest gap in income that we
have had in this country.
There is no surprise there is a lot of
pushback from not only people on the
other side of the aisle, but from the
United States Chamber of Commerce,
which is not your local business in
your chamber of commerce, but it is
the big businesses in this country that
don’t want to take care of their work-
ers. Instead, they want to send all the
profits up to their shareholders, so
very few get a lot and everyone else
gets the crumbs that are left over.
Just to give you an idea of some of
the actions we see by these companies:
75 percent of private-sector employers
hire outside consultants to run
antiunion campaigns when workers try
to form a union; 63 percent force their
employees to attend closed-door meet-
ings to hear antiunion propaganda; and
over half of employers threaten work-
ers in these meetings, they threaten
their jobs.
You have a one-in-five chance, if you
are a union organizer, of losing your
job because, right now, you can get
away with it with this administration
and how they enforce our labor laws.
But here is the reality. If you don’t
have a union in your company right
now, this is what you get when you
have a union:
Health insurance: 75 percent of peo-
ple in a union participate in job-pro-
vided health insurance versus about 48
percent nationwide;
Pensions: 70 percent of people versus
13 percent nationwide;
Paid sick leave: 91 percent of people
who are in a union have paid sick
leave, and the median weekly earnings
are $207 more a week. That is $11,000 a
year more if you are a member of a
union, in a similar job, than if you are
not.
That is the real reason we see the at-
tacks on working people trying to have
a voice in their workplaces, and that is
why we see people not trying to lift
this bill.
This is so important that, in this
Congress, we take this bill up in the
House of Representatives and we pass
this bill and we give, finally, an edge to
help push a little more assistance to
workers who want to have a say in the
workplace than what employers have
had because of this administration, be-
cause of States that have passed bad
laws, that make it harder, again, to
have a say in your workplace.
This is an important piece of legisla-
tion. The Congressional Progressive
Caucus has made this issue a priority.
We are going to make sure there will
be a vote this session in Congress. We
are going to try to make the Senate
take this up as well.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman
from Chicago. His help on this and so
many issues has been so very impor-
tant. We are going to do everything we
can to get this done this session.
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker,
I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin
for his remarks.
So what is the essence of the Protect
the Right to Organize Act? We have
heard from my colleagues today about
the many ways that unions have made
America strong. From the 8-hour day
to building the middle class, we have a
lot to thank the labor movement for.
Unions are an integral part of increas-
ing wages and addressing income in-
equality.
Still, special interest-funded attacks
on labor laws have eroded union mem-
bership for years. For too long, greedy
companies have used extreme measures
to stop working people from exercising
their right to join together and nego-
tiate for their rights and their working
conditions.
While the economy is working very
well for the wealthy, our middle class
continues to shrink. The cause is sim-
ple: policy choices, especially by Re-
publicans in the House at this time, in
the Senate, in State legislatures, and
the Presidency that have stripped
workers of the power to stand together.
The Protecting the Right to Organize
Act is a historical proposal that re-
stores fairness in the economy by
strengthening the Federal laws to pro-
tect workers’ rights to organize.
We need the PRO Act at a time when
Trump wages war against the labor
movement. We need the PRO Act to
build an economy that works for all
working families and not just the
wealthy.
The lessons I learned from unions—
that individual justice is only as good
as collective justice—continue to in-
form my career in public service, and I
hope every worker can have the oppor-
tunities that unions gave me.
I got a chance to work at a young
age. I joined a union. It helped me pay
for my college education. I did well in
the community that I still live in. That
is why I approach banding together for
the welfare of working people.
Tonight, you have heard from people
from coast to coast, all over our coun-
try, from the South and from the
heartland. These are individuals who
are fighting for working people to,
again, level the playing field and cre-
ate a real purpose of economic justice
to lift everyone up in our country.
As we move forward with the PRO
Act, I call upon the American public to
understand that it is time for economic
justice and it is time for prosperity for
all. And, with that, I ask them to call
on their Representatives in the U.S.
Congress to make this law a reality for
all working men and women across the
Nation.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
f
ISSUES OF THE DAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT)
for 30 minutes.
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I really
haven’t ever become friends with Gen-
eral Michael Flynn. He doesn’t object
to being called Michael Flynn, even
though he earned the title of ‘‘Gen-
eral,’’ even though he has not been
treated fairly at all and has actually
been treated unjustly.
There is an article today from Mar-
got Cleveland in The Federalist. It
talks about Michael Flynn’s case, and I
am learning some things.
I think the world of Sidney Powell.
She is an amazing attorney. She is a
friend. But there is a motion pending
before Federal Judge Emmett Sullivan
on a motion to compel and motion for
sanctions that attorney Sidney Powell
had filed.
‘‘Powell’s motion seeks to force Fed-
eral prosecutors to provide Flynn an
array of documents withheld from his
attorneys and to sanction government
lawyers for their failure to provide rel-
evant evidence to the defense team in a
timely manner.’’
Now, as a former judge—and I have
prosecuted, I have defended, and I have
been a chief justice, but nothing is
more infuriating to me, when it comes
to our justice system, than prosecutors
who are unjust, who lie, who misrepre-
sent. And it looks like all of that has
been occurring in Michael Flynn’s case
or with deference to, like Colonel
Vindman, General Michael Flynn.
This article points out: ‘‘Then, mere
days after the final briefing came in,’’
to Judge Sullivan, ‘‘Federal prosecu-
tors found themselves forced to admit
that, for nearly 3 years, they had
wrongly identified the authors of the
handwritten notes taken by the FBI
agents during their January 24, 2017,
interview of then-National Security
Advisor Flynn. Prosecutors had told
defense counsel, and the court, that the
notes written by Peter Strozk had been
compiled by FBI Agent Joe Pietka, and
those taken by Pietka had been writ-
ten by Strozk.
‘‘This embarrassing mea culpa surely
added strength to Powell’s plea for ac-
cess to other withheld evidence. After
all, if Federal prosecutors made such a
basic blunder concerning key evidence,
what other mistakes lay buried in the
undisclosed evidence?’’
This goes on and points out that, at
a minimum, things that are being set
out now ‘‘would also support the with-
drawal of Flynn’s guilty plea—some-
thing Powell does not appear to be con-
sidering at this time—including’’—and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9117
November 20, 2019
here is the circumstance that is just
phenomenal, that, in a Federal district
court we could have Justice Depart-
ment attorneys who are this flagrantly
abusive of the process.
So, ‘‘Flynn’s original attorneys had a
conflict of interest preventing them
from representing Flynn in the crimi-
nal case; Flynn did not intentionally
make false statements to the FBI
agents; the FBI agents entrapped
Flynn; Flynn’s purported
misstatements were immaterial to the
investigation into supposed Russia col-
lusion and, thus, no crime occurred;
the government engaged in selective
prosecution and charged Flynn solely
because of his relationship to Trump;
prosecutors used threats to induce
Flynn’s plea; the prosecutors’ failure
to timely disclose exculpatory and im-
peachment evidence invalidates
Flynn’s plea; and that egregious pros-
ecutorial and government misconduct
mandates dismissal of all charges
against Flynn.’’
If you go down further, more revela-
tions.
‘‘The government had pushed Flynn’s
previous attorneys at Covington and
Burling LLP, in February 2017, to
quickly file a registration statement
under the Foreign Agent Registration
Act, FARA, for Flynn Intel Group,
FIG. Federal prosecutors later ob-
tained indictments against Flynn’s
FIG business partners for supposed
Foreign Agent Registration Act viola-
tions, and still later, the prosecutors
branded Flynn a co-conspirator in the
FARA case. There was a clear conflict
of interest, which the government
failed to mention to Judge Sullivan.
‘‘Further, since Flynn last appeared
before Sullivan, the government’s
FARA case against his FIG partners
has imploded. Following a 6-day trial, a
jury had convicted Flynn’s former
business partner, Bijan Rafiekian, of
acting as an unregistered agent of Tur-
key, conspiring to act as an unregis-
tered agent of Turkey. . . . ‘’
It says: ‘‘But Federal Judge Anthony
Trenga stepped in and tossed the guilty
verdict, concluding that no ‘rational
jury could conclude that Rafiekian
conspired with Alptekin or anyone
else.’ Judge Trenga further held that
‘there is no evidence of discussions or
suggestions, let alone any agreement
express or implied, to either avoid fil-
ing under FARA or to cause the filing
of a false FARA registration state-
ment.’ ’’
b 2000
‘‘That the government’s FARA case
against Flynn’s business partner
proved bogus should also trouble Sul-
livan because, according to Powell’s
earlier court filings, the special coun-
sel’s office had informed Flynn’s ‘coun-
sel in the summer of 2017 that it was
going to indict the FARA case then,
had obtained authorization to target
Michael Flynn, Jr.—who had a new-
born—and had seized all his electronic
devices.’
‘‘The threat was clear: Plead guilty
and cooperate or we will prosecute
your son. And given Judge Trenga’s
conclusion in the Rafiekian case that
there was no evidence of a FARA
crime, there is an added postscript: We
will prosecute your son on bogus
charges.’’
Unbelievable. It also should be quite
scary to someone situated as Michael
Flynn, General Flynn, that the Federal
Government, the DOJ—especially when
they use unscrupulous and unethical
means—they can convict anybody,
even when there is no evidence whatso-
ever as Judge Trenga found, there was
no evidence whatsoever.
I don’t know these people, but I know
the Federal judge said there was no
evidence whatsoever. And, yet, the jury
came back—I am sure the judge was
just thinking: I will let the jury find
there is no evidence because there is
none.
And when they came back and con-
victed, wow, the judge is going: I have
got to throw this out. This is totally
bogus.
‘‘The threat also wasn’t a one off:
After Powell took over representation
of Flynn, federal prosecutors at-
tempted to force Flynn to testify at
Rafiekian’s trial that Flynn had know-
ingly made false statements in the
FARA filings—something Flynn denies.
When Flynn refused to lie, federal pros-
ecutors abruptly added Michael Flynn,
Jr. to the witness list for the Rafiekian
trial, but then never called him to tes-
tify.’’
Total intimidation. Total effort to
intimidate. Very unethical.
‘‘The government, according to Pow-
ell, also had an FBI agent contact
Flynn, Jr. directly, even though the
younger Flynn was represented by
counsel.’’ Also quite unethical.
Boy, the unethical conduct in this
Department of Justice hasn’t gone
away. It hasn’t stopped with Strzok
and Page, being gone—Bruce Ohr, all of
these others that appeared to conspire
to defeat a Presidential candidate, and
then to try the coup to take him out.
‘‘The government, according to Pow-
ell, also had an FBI agent contact
Flynn, Jr. directly.
‘‘These maneuvers corroborate the
prosecutors earlier use of Flynn, Jr. as
a pawn to pressure his father to plead
guilty.’’
I mean, this stuff is just amazing.
And if they can do this to someone who
spent over 30 years dedicated to the de-
fense of his country, all kinds of deco-
rations for heroism, and powerful
friends in Washington, they can do this
to him, it is difficult to think about
the terrible situation of someone with-
out money, without friends.
If these people can be this unscrupu-
lous to people with some power, it just
bodes very poorly for this little experi-
ment in self-government when the judi-
cial branch, or I am sorry, the execu-
tive branch’s prosecutorial wing is this
abusive. Absolutely incredible. A bit
frightening, actually.
So I would like to also touch on some
of the testimony that has gone on in
yesterday’s hearing, the part where we
had Jennifer Williams and Lieutenant
Colonel Vindman.
He said, I think, that he has been in
over 20 years. Didn’t make Colonel.
And I have known people, you know,
my 4 years in the Army, we saw those
folks. They were so self-righteous on
the one hand, maybe they didn’t get a
promotion they thought they deserved.
Maybe it was because they did some-
thing like Vindman did and was
trashing the United States to Russians
when he was overheard by a superior
that reprimanded him for it.
Sometimes it is just because there is
a mean superior that doesn’t want
somebody promoted. But for whatever
reason, he didn’t become a full Colonel.
Here he is, harping after he had been
called Lieutenant Colonel over and
over by my friend, DEVIN NUNES, he
interrupts and demands—and I notice
he didn’t always call people Congress-
man. That didn’t bother me, but it is
just quite interesting that he has such
a double standard for himself and for
others.
But when you look at the testimony,
especially page 2, it is interesting—and
actually, this is from our friend ADAM
SCHIFF, Congressman ADAM SCHIFF—
‘‘Colonel Vindman, we have seen’’—and
I guess it should have been Lieutenant
Colonel Vindman—‘‘we have seen far
more scurrilous attacks on your char-
acter, and watched as certain personal-
ities on Fox have questioned your loy-
alty. I note that you have shed blood
for America, and we owe you an im-
mense debt of gratitude.’’ So that is
the case, we owe him a debt of grati-
tude for defending our country.
I do love history and I point out down
the hall when we are in the rotunda to
groups, we have got General Gates
standing there accepting surrender
from the British, and he was not the
real hero of the Battle of Saratoga, and
that was the biggest victory since De-
cember 24, 1776, probably.
And it was a big one, but it wasn’t
Gates. I read another book on the Rev-
olution just months ago, and this book
was saying Gates never got out of his
tent, whether it was cowardice or
whatever, he never would get out of his
tent. But there was this great, brave,
courageous, young major that just
knew they could defeat the British
there at Saratoga if they get on going
and attack them. Gates wouldn’t give
the order, so this major rallied folks,
and they went down and they attacked
the British, and they defeated them.
So the real hero of Saratoga wasn’t
General Gates. It was this major, a
tough, strapping guy. He took them on,
and he was wounded. And he carried a
limp with him probably the rest of his
life. He was wounded. He was hurt se-
verely. But we owe that guy a debt of
gratitude for his defense of his country.
Of course, later on, he got upset that
he had been slighted and didn’t get a
promotion like Gates’ immediate sub-
ordinates, and then that caused him to

fall prey to the British talking him
into helping them because they would
pay him, and they would appreciate
him a whole lot more than Washington
and others. And, of course, then he
ended up setting up Washington to be
kidnapped by the British.
But I am amazed how many people
don’t know that we owe a great debt of
gratitude to Major Benedict Arnold,
because without him, there is no vic-
tory at the Battle of Saratoga, and
that was a huge victory, so very impor-
tant to our becoming an independent
country.
So anyway, it is just interesting
when you think about history and peo-
ple who demand to be given respect,
and if they are not, they get rather
snippy.
And I don’t know that I have ever
met Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, but
to find out that he was trashing the
United States to Russians, and it was
just intriguing to go through his testi-
mony.
For example, he said this about the
investigation into the 2016 elections,
Bidens, Burisma.
‘‘I stated to Ambassador Sondland
that this was inappropriate and it had
nothing to do with national security.
Dr. Hill also asserted his comments
weren’t proper. Following the meeting,
Dr. Hill and I agreed to report the inci-
dent to the NSC’s lead counsel.’’
So it is interesting. Further, he was
asked by Mr. Goldman: ‘‘On September
10, the Intelligence Committee re-
quested the whistleblower complaint
from the Department of National Intel-
ligence.’’
He wasn’t aware of that. But it is
just, wow, so September 10, they obvi-
ously knew all about the so-called
whistleblower complaint.
But when you get over here to part of
the questioning by Congressman
NUNES: ‘‘Did you ask or encourage any
individual to share the substance of the
July 25th phone call or any matter as-
sociated with the call with any mem-
ber of the press?’’
‘‘I did not.’’
And he goes on like that. And then he
said:
‘‘Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, did
you discuss the July 25th phone call
with anyone outside the White House
on July 25th or the 26th, and if so, with
whom?’’
And he said: ‘‘Yes, I did. My core
function is to coordinate U.S. Govern-
ment policy, interagency policy, and I
spoke to two individuals with regards
to providing some sort of readout of
the call.’’
NUNES says: ‘‘Two individuals that
were not in the White House?’’
Vindman: ‘‘Not in the White House.’’
And that is Lieutenant Colonel
Vindman. ‘‘Not in the White House,
cleared U.S. Government officials with
appropriate need to know.’’
‘‘And what agencies were these offi-
cials with?’’
Lieutenant Colonel Vindman said:
‘‘Department of State, Deputy Assist-
ant Secretary George Kent, who is re-
sponsible for the portfolio, Eastern Eu-
rope including Ukraine, and an indi-
vidual from the office of—an individual
in the intelligence community.’’
And that is where NUNES says: ‘‘As
you know, the intelligence community
has 17 different agencies. What agency
was this individual from?’’
And that is when Chairman SCHIFF
said: ‘‘If I could interject. We don’t
want to use these proceedings’’—and
then cross talk—‘‘we need to protect
the whistleblower.’’
And what is really interesting, of
course, is when he calls out Congress-
man NUNES. ‘‘It’s Lieutenant Colonel
Vindman, please.’’ So I want to make
sure that I don’t slight him.
He says—and he is under oath—‘‘I
don’t know who the whistleblower is.
That is correct.’’
And yet, he gets down to there is two
people. He identifies one, and Chair-
man SCHIFF interrupts and doesn’t
want him to out the other person, be-
cause that would be outing the whistle-
blower.
And, yet, Chairman SCHIFF and Lieu-
tenant Colonel Vindman say they don’t
know who the whistleblower is, but it
must be that one that he has been told
not to answer because that would give
away the whistleblower’s identity.
And yet, they say, we don’t know
who the whistleblower is, but we are
down to one person, but we don’t know
who it is. Even though if he gives the
name, it will out the whistleblower. It
is just really amazing when you look at
this stuff.
And it is actually rather tragic.
There was a question Mr. Castor says:
‘‘And are you aware, and George Kent
testified a little bit about this last
week, that under the Obama adminis-
tration, the U.S. Government encour-
aged Ukraine to investigate whether
Zlochevsky used his government posi-
tion to grant himself or Burisma explo-
ration licenses. Are you aware of
that?’’
And Lieutenant Colonel Vindman
said: ‘‘I would defer to George Kent.
He’s a fount of knowledge on Ukraine,
much deeper knowledge than I have. If
he attested to that, then I’d take his
word for it.’’
Well, isn’t it interesting that Mr.
Kent knew that the Obama administra-
tion was trying to get to the bottom of
corruption about Burisma, and, yet, he
freaks out, not Kent, but Lieutenant
Colonel Vindman, freaks out over
Burisma being brought up, that that is
some kind of crime for an impeachable
offense, basically, for President Trump
to bring up the corruption and includ-
ing Burisma.
But isn’t that interesting? He didn’t
bring up there is a problem with the
Obama administration bringing it up,
just President Trump.
b 2015
But Ranking Member NUNES also
brings up that, I asked Ms. Williams
about this, about, if she had ever
accessed, without authorization, col-
leagues’ computers. She answered no.
And he goes on through some of that.
But you get down here and then it is
turned over to JIM JORDAN. Congress-
man JORDAN said, ‘‘Mr. Morrison said
this: ‘I had concerns about Lieutenant
Colonel Vindman’s judgment. Among
the discussions I had with Dr. Hill—
that is Fiona Hill—in the transition
with our team, its strength, its weak-
nesses, and Fiona and others had raised
concern about Alex’s—he should have
said Lieutenant Colonel Vindman’s—
judgment’. When Mr. Morrison was
asked by Mr. Castor, ‘Did anyone ever
bring concerns to you that they believe
Colonel Vindman may have leaked
something,’ Mr. Morrison replied,
‘yes.’ ’’
They thought he was a leaker well
before this all happened.
So your boss had concerns about your
judgment—your favored boss, Dr. Hill—
had concerns about your judgment,
your colleagues had concerns about
your judgment, and your colleagues
felt that there were times when you
leaked information. Any idea where
they might have gotten those impres-
sions, Colonel Vindman?
He calls him ‘‘Colonel.’’ He gave him
a promotion.
But Vindman says ‘‘yes.’’ And then
he raised an OER that was somewhat
glowing, but actually the answer
should have been ‘‘no,’’ if he was being
truthful, because he later says, ‘‘I can’t
say why Mr. Morrison questioned my
judgment.’’
But Congressman JORDAN goes on:
‘‘Colonel, it’s interesting, we deposed a
lot of people in the bunker, in the base-
ment of the Capitol, over the last sev-
eral weeks, but of all those depositions,
only three of the individuals we de-
posed were actually on the now-some-
what-famous July 25 phone call be-
tween President Trump and President
Zelensky. There was you, the indi-
vidual sitting beside you, Ms. Williams,
and then there, of course, was your
boss, Mr. Morrison. . . .’’
‘‘When we asked Ms. Williams who
she spoke to after the call, about the
call, she was willing to answer our
questions, and Chairman SCHIFF al-
lowed her to answer the questions.
When we asked Mr. Morrison who he
spoke to after the call, about the call,
he was willing to answer our question
and Chairman SCHIFF allowed him to
answer our question. But when we
asked you, you first told us three indi-
viduals at the NSC, your brother and
two lawyers. And then you said there
was a group of other people you com-
municated with, but you would only
give us one individual in that group,
Secretary Kent. And the chairman
would only allow you to give us that
name. When we asked you who else you
communicated with, you would not tell
us. So what I want to know first, how
many other people are in that group of
people you communicated with outside
the four individuals I just named?’’
‘‘Mr. JORDAN, on a call readout’’—
this is Lieutenant Colonel Vindman—

November 20, 2019
‘‘on a call readout, certainly after the
first call, there were probably a half a
dozen or more people that I read out.
Those are people with the proper clear-
ance and the need to know. In this
case, because of the sensitivity of the
call, Mr. Eisenberg told me not to
speak to anybody else. I only read out,
outside of the NSC, two individuals.’’
So very interesting there. And it is
interesting, too, that, you know, the
fact is if Lieutenant Colonel Vindman,
say hypothetically he leaked—as he
had been suspected of in other case or
cases—say he leaked in this case to
people that didn’t have proper clear-
ance, he probably would try to assert: I
was named as a whistleblower, and
once I had that status, you can’t pros-
ecute me. And then there would be a
motion to dismiss, this kind of thing.
And ultimately, the courts would
say: Wait a minute. The whistleblower
statute does not protect the whistle-
blower, because to protect a whistle-
blower, the person being complained
about has to be within the department
or agency from the person com-
plaining. The President is not in the
Intel agencies or department, and so it
just wouldn’t work. And, of course, pre-
viously you had to have direct knowl-
edge.
And I would submit, if you look,
treason is something the President can
be impeached for, but under the Con-
stitution, that requires two people
with direct knowledge as direct wit-
nesses, not hearsay—can’t be hearsay—
direct witnesses to a crime. They have
to testify. If you don’t have two, you
can’t prove treason under the Constitu-
tion. It is out.
And I would submit, the Senate
would do well—if this is sent down
there—to require the same thing of
whatever bogus charge ends up coming
their way, because that is all we have
seen so far, but require two people with
direct evidence. A bunch of people have
been convicted of treason. No President
has ever been removed. So if we are
going to remove a President, it ought
to require two direct witnesses as well.
And so it ought to be a short trial.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

Vol. 165 WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 2019 No. 186
Senate
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was
called to order by the President pro
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).
f
PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Listen to our prayers, Almighty God.
Let not our Nation be ashamed. You
are our mighty rock and fortress. Lead
and guide us, enabling us to honor
Your Name. Protect our lawmakers
from the hidden traps that can derail
freedom. Remind them that the truth
alone will make us free. Show Yourself
strong even to those who strive to save
themselves. Manifest Your might to
all. May our Senators trust You, seek
Your wisdom, and obey Your precepts.
We pray in Your mighty Name.
Amen.
f
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The President pro tempore led the
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRAMER). The Senator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak as in
morning business for 1 minute.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
f
FAMILY FIRST PREVENTION
SERVICES ACT
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in re-
cent years, the opioid epidemic has re-
sulted in steadily climbing numbers of
kids entering foster care.
However, in 2018, the number of chil-
dren in foster care has declined for the
first time since 2011. This is evidence
that prevention programs are working.
It is important this renewed focus on
prevention continues as all 50 States
work to implement the Family First
Prevention Services Act. When child
welfare agencies have more tools,
which they will have through this new
legislation, to help families before chil-
dren must be removed, outcomes are
better for communities, better for par-
ents, and, more importantly, better for
the children we are trying to protect.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
f
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY
LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
f
HONG KONG HUMAN RIGHTS AND
DEMOCRACY ACT
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday the U.S. Senate spoke up force-
fully and clearly for the brave people of
Hong Kong. We unanimously passed
the Hong Kong Human Rights and De-
mocracy Act.
As the author of the original United
States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992,
and somebody who has advocated for
Hongkongers for decades, I was proud
to speak out on this back in the sum-
mer when the protests began. I was
also proud to secure important policy
steps for Hong Kong in the Senate Sub-
committee on State, Foreign Oper-
ations, and Related Programs back in
September.
I am also proud that Senators ap-
proved these further steps to update
the original law to preserve Hong
Kong’s autonomy and democracy and
provide more tools for holding Beijing
accountable.
I want to thank the senior Senator
from Florida, all the other Members
who led on this issue, and all of our
colleagues for securing unanimous pas-
sage.
While this bill moves forward, it is
also important for the executive
branch and our allies and partners
around the world to fulfill their roles
as well. Even before this new bill be-
comes law, Congress has already given
the administration significant powers
to act, including authorities to directly
sanction individuals who violate
human rights. I urge every trading na-
tion around the world to look clearly
at Hong Kong and at Xinjiang and
imagine the costs as China continues
to entrench its surveillance state and
export it all around the world.
The Senate continues to do our part.
Everyone else must do theirs as well.
The United States and the world must
stand with Hong Kong.
f
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA
AGREEMENT
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on
another matter, earlier this week, I got
to attend the Kentucky Electric Co-
operative’s annual meeting. The group
represents 26 co-ops across Kentucky,
particularly in rural communities.
We talked about the positive trends
for what you might call Middle Amer-
ica over the past several years—the
nascent economic turnaround in small
towns, small cities, farm country, rural
America, and other places the Obama
economy largely left behind.
We also talked about the work still
ahead. One of the major priorities that
Kentuckians mentioned is the USMCA.
I have heard it from our farmers, man-
ufacturers, logistics providers, and
bourbon distillers. Almost every sector
of our economy would benefit from this
trade deal.
Together, Canada and Mexico make

S6682 November 20, 2019
our trading framework with our neigh-
bors would send that number even
higher, generate more wealth here at
home, and create an estimated 176,000
new American jobs.
It is no wonder that so many Ken-
tuckians and so many people around
the country want Washington to get it
done. I hear from everybody, from fam-
ily farming operations to midsize man-
ufacturers, to Fortune 500 firms, such
as UPS and Toyota, that employ thou-
sands and thousands in my State. All
of them want this fairer, better playing
field in trade with Canada and Mexico.
In a little more than a week from
now, it will have been a full year since
President Trump signed the draft
agreement along with the leaders of
Canada and Mexico—1 full year—but
for months now, this generational
agreement has been sitting on ice over
in the House of Representatives.
Speaker PELOSI has refused to allow a
vote.
In public, House Democrats insist
and insist that they care about more
things than simply impeaching the
President. They insist that they want
to work together and legislate, but ac-
tions speak louder than words, and ap-
parently, thus far, House Democrats
have preferred to block 176,000 new jobs
for American workers rather than put
impeachment aside and get along with
the White House for 5 minutes. It ap-
pears there is no governing priority—
no matter how bipartisan, no matter
how beneficial to American families—
that will not take a backseat to im-
peachment.
Month after month, every time she
has been asked about this subject, the
Speaker of the House has offered the
same empty rhetoric. She is always
close to allowing the vote. Her con-
ference is always ‘‘almost there, al-
most there,’’ but we have been almost
there for months and months with no
outcome in sight. Lots of talk but zero
results.
Back in February, the Speaker was
asked about the USMCA. She said,
‘‘I’m optimistic.’’ That was last Feb-
ruary.
We heard the same thing in May and
in June. ‘‘We want to pass this bill.’’
We heard the same thing through the
summer and in September and in Octo-
ber. ‘‘Every day we’re becoming clos-
er,’’ she said. A few weeks ago the
Speaker said: ‘‘I think we are close . . .
the last mile,’’ and she called this ‘‘the
easiest trade deal that we’ve ever
done.’’ A few days ago, the Speaker in-
sisted, yet again, a vote was ‘‘immi-
nent.’’ That was a few days ago.
This has been the House Democrats’
wild goose chase. This is what our
American families, American job cre-
ators, and our partners in Mexico and
Canada have had to put up with. Every
time the Trump administration meets
the Speaker halfway, she tries to move
the goal post another 10 yards. She lit-
erally has not even updated her own
talking points since Valentine’s Day—
textbook obstruction.
Just in case anybody did not yet un-
derstand that the real roadblock here
is partisan politics, I understand the
Speaker hosted Richard Trumka yes-
terday, head of the AFL–CIO, a power
player in leftwing Big Labor. He came
to the Capitol to quell the uprising of
the Democrats’ own Members who
can’t believe this thing still hasn’t
passed. How ironic. We are talking
about a trade deal that would create
more American jobs, and Democrats
are considering outsourcing their judg-
ment to Big Labor special interests,
who, to my recollection, have not sup-
ported a single major trade deal in liv-
ing memory.
Let’s get this straight. It sounds like
the head of the AFL–CIO—an organiza-
tion that has never supported any
trade agreement—is now the guy who
gives the go-ahead on USMCA? We are
talking about a trade deal, and Demo-
crats are considering outsourcing their
own jobs to the head of AFL–CIO—real-
ly? I wish I were making this up.
Reporters got ahold of the chairman
of the House Ways and Means Com-
mittee yesterday, and he literally said
the deal would move forward ‘‘if we can
get Richard Trumka to agree.’’ So the
head of the AFL–CIO—an organization
that has never supported a trade agree-
ment—is now the guy who has to
green-light the USMCA, which would
create 176,000 American jobs. No won-
der they have a problem in the House.
The chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee literally said that this
major trade agreement will move for-
ward only if this major Democratic
campaign contributor gives them per-
mission.
Well, it appears that even some
House Democrats are getting fed up
with the absurdity. Here is what one of
them said yesterday:
[Trumka] still says we’re at the five yard
line. . . . So it feels like we’ve been at the
five yard line for a while.
No kidding. This is the biggest oppor-
tunity the House Democrats have had
in the entirety of their first year in
power to do something significant and
substantive for American families—to
actually pass something new and real
that can become law and strengthen
our Nation. In other words, the USMCA
is House Democrats’ final exam for
their whole first year in power. And
unless something turns around very
quickly, after nearly a year of happy
talk and empty promises, their leader-
ship seems determined to flunk that
exam. All impeachment, all the time—
and even the most obvious win for
American workers and small businesses
gets blocked. That will be Democrats’
progress report if USMCA goes no-
where. Obviously, I hope that is not
how this story ends.
Mexico has passed it. Canada is wait-
ing on us. I believe a bipartisan major-
ity of the Senate is ready to pass it.
Our workers, our job creators, and our
neighbors are just waiting on Speaker
PELOSI. This is no time to kill a na-
tional victory out of political spite.
This is no time to outsource your judg-
ment to special interests. The Speaker
should allow a vote, and the House
should send us the USMCA.

APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, with
government funding set to expire to-
morrow, the House of Representatives
passed a continuing resolution yester-
day to fund the government through
December 20. It is now up to the Senate
to pass the continuing resolution with-
out much fuss and send it to the Presi-
dent’s desk before the deadline.
As the Republican leader and I work
to set the time for that vote, we must
look ahead. The continuing resolution
will give appropriators additional time
to get a bipartisan appropriations proc-
ess back on track before the end of the
year. The Senate has been able to proc-
ess several noncontroversial appropria-
tions bills, bipartisan, but several more
can’t move forward until the Demo-
crats and the Republicans both all
agree on the allocations. You can’t do
it with one party. That leads to trou-
ble. In recent days, we have made some
progress, and I hope the talks between
both sets of appropriators—House and
Senate, Democratic and Republican—
will continue in good faith and in ear-
nest after we finish the continuing res-
olution.

resolution that the Senate Republicans
refuse to address. Most notably, the
Republicans objected to restoring ex-
pired funding for the minority-serving
institutions, including historically
Black colleges and universities, Tribal
colleges and universities, Hispanic-
serving institutions, Asian American
and Native American Pacific Islander-
serving institutions, and predomi-
nantly Black institutions.
These are ladders up. Such a high
percentage of people of color—people in
minority groups—use these colleges to
create great lives for themselves. They
work hard, and they study. There are
no alternatives for them other than
these institutions. To hold the money
back, which is what the other side is
doing, is so wrong. It is so unfair.
The Democrats will not stop fighting
the fight to help these institutions, and
we are committed to securing this
funding in any way we can. These are
American dream institutions. If you
believe in the American dream, you
shouldn’t be holding this money back.
TURKEY AND SYRIA
Mr. President, on Syria, the Defense
Intelligence Agency—it is like the CIA,
but it is for the Defense Department; it
is very well respected and very non-
partisan and is great in many ways—
released a new assessment yesterday
that confirms, unfortunately, many of
our worst fears. If people haven’t seen
this assessment, it is really important.
I would urge people to look at it.
What did the assessment indicate?
President Trump’s own Defense De-
partment wrote that President Trump,
by his precipitously withdrawing our
troops from northern Syria, has given
ISIS a lifeline.
In the chaos that has followed
Erdogan’s military offensive—an offen-
sive, unfortunately, that President
Trump green-lit, much to the con-
sternation of people on both sides of
the aisle—ISIS has had room to re-
build. Not only did the assessment sug-
gest that the Islamic State is ‘‘pos-
tured to withstand’’ the recent death of
its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, but
it concluded that the Islamic State
‘‘exploited the Turkish incursion and
subsequent drawdown of U.S. troops to
reconstitute capabilities and resources
within Syria and’’—my emphasis but
their words—‘‘strengthen its ability to
plan attacks abroad.’’
By President Trump’s giving in to
Erdogan, ISIS has been able to
‘‘strengthen its ability to plan attacks
abroad.’’ Every American should hear
that. Let me repeat. Because President
Trump abruptly withdrew U.S. troops
from northern Syria, ISIS has been
able to strengthen its ability to plan
attacks abroad. That is not an assess-
ment from some outside group or agen-
cy; that is the assessment of the De-
fense Intelligence Agency, which is
part of the Pentagon. The Trump ad-
ministration needs to get a handle on
this situation fast.
Despite this new damning assess-
ment, we still have no idea what the
President plans to do to ensure the en-
during defeat of ISIS. President Trump
has welcomed President Erdogan to the
White House, but he hasn’t produced a
plan to defeat ISIS. This is an adminis-
tration run amuck. This is security.
This is vital to America. There is no
plan about ISIS, but there is the greet-
ing of Erdogan—a dictator whose desire
to go after ISIS isn’t close to ours. He
would much rather go after the
Kurds—our main protector from ISIS
other than the United States itself.
Meanwhile, there are now reports
that Russian forces have taken control
of the former U.S. military base in
northern Syria. The pictures of Rus-
sia’s entering that deserted base be-
cause American soldiers were told they
had to leave by the President is not a
picture Americans want to see. It is in-
credible. The President continues to
demonstrate an uncanny ability to get
steamrolled by autocrats like Erdogan
and like Putin without getting a thing
in return.
It has been nearly 2 months since the
President announced the withdrawal of
U.S. troops, and we still don’t know
what comes next. We all know that a
small band of terrorists far away is
more than capable of inflicting great
damage on our shores, and the intel-
ligence assessments have now con-
firmed that ISIS has been able to
strengthen its ability to do just that.
President Trump, what is your plan
to defeat ISIS and protect the United
States?
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT
Mr. President, on the NDAA, the De-
fense authorization bill, the annual De-
fense bill, which passed this Chamber
months ago, has been stalled in the
process of reconciling the Senate’s
version with the House’s version.
One of the snags, it now appears, is
the Republican leader’s unwillingness
to include a strong package of sanc-
tions directed at any foreign nation
that should try to interfere in our elec-
tions. That is right. One of the reasons
the national defense bill has not been
sent to the President’s desk is because
Majority Leader MCCONNELL and his
Republican colleagues do not want to
include a strong deterrent to inter-
fering in American elections.
Earlier this month, all leading U.S.
national security officials—Attorney
General Barr, Secretary of Defense
Esper, Acting Secretary of Homeland
Security McAleenan, Acting Director
of National Intelligence Maguire, FBI
Director Wray, and U.S. Cyber Com-
mand Commander Nakasone—released
a statement that read the following:
Our adversaries want to undermine our
democratic institutions, influence public
sentiment and affect government policies.
Russia, China, Iran, and other foreign mali-
cious actors all will seek to interfere in the
voting process or influence voter percep-
tions.
Those are not my words. They are
from the leaders of this administra-
tion, including the Secretaries of De-
fense and State and the head of the
NSA.
We know that Putin interfered in the
2016 elections. We know he is trying to
do it again. That is clear. We need to
send an unmistakable message to
President Putin and other foreign ac-
tors—China and Iran—that we will not
tolerate any interference in our elec-
tions.
Unfortunately, Leader MCCONNELL
seems to have missed that memo. How
he could ignore a statement by the
leaders of the administration he sup-
ports is beyond me. The Republican
leader has repeatedly downplayed the
threat to our democracy from foreign
actors like President Putin. He has re-
peatedly blocked commonsense, bipar-
tisan legislation to protect our elec-
tions and is now blocking the inclusion
of tough, mandatory sanctions on Rus-
sia or on any other foreign country
that seeks to interfere in our elections.
I hope, for the sake of the Defense
bill and for the sake of our elections,
the Republican leader will relent and
allow a package of tough sanctions to
be included.
Unfortunately, election security is
not the only issue holding up the De-
fense bill. The Republican leader is
blocking many other important provi-
sions.
The Democrats want to extend fam-
ily leave benefits to all Federal em-
ployees. The majority leader and the
Republicans are blocking that. This is
a new world. Family leave is necessary
to everyone. Here we have a chance to
do it for Federal workers, and our Re-
publican friends are saying no.
The Democrats want to clean up our
communities and military installa-
tions that have been poisoned by PFAS
and other contaminants, but the ma-
jority leader and our friends, the Re-
publicans here in the Senate, are
blocking that.
The Democrats want to send a signal
to the Trump administration that it
does not have a blank check to wage a
war and that only Congress can ap-
prove major military operations. Ma-
jority Leader MCCONNELL and the Re-
publicans are blocking that as well.
There are hosts of important issues
that are holding up the final passage of
the national defense bill. These are just
a few of them. I strongly urge my Re-
publican friends and, especially, Re-
publican Leader MCCONNELL to work
with us to address these provisions.
The Democrats want to see that this
bill gets done and that it gets done in
a way that safeguards our elections,
our troops, our communities, and ad-
vances America’s interests around the
globe.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.

FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there
are various options available for grad-
uates of high schools across the United
States. Some of them choose to go to
college or university, but even making
that choice gives you a lot of options.
There are basically two categories of
schools, though, that I want to address
in this statement this morning. One
category is called for-profit colleges
and universities, and the other is the
traditional not-for-profit colleges and
universities, which would include your
community colleges and public univer-
sities and many not-for-profit, private
universities.
But I want to focus this morning on
the for-profit colleges and universities
in the United States. People sometimes
can’t make the distinction between
which is which. Some of the big names
in the for-profit industry include the
University of Phoenix. That is one you
probably heard of. DeVry University is
another one you might have heard of.
There are some defining characteris-
tics of these schools. They, of course,
are in business to make money, and
they have a different economic model
than many of the other universities.
I have met the CEOs of for-profit col-
leges and universities and found that in
some cases they have limited or no ex-
perience when it comes to education.
They are investors. They are business
people. The idea of education is a sec-
ondary part of why they were chosen.
There is an important statistic—in
fact, two statistics—that I want to
preface my remarks with, and these
will be on the final, I might add, for
those who are following this state-
ment.
The numbers 9 and 33—9 and 33. Why
are they important? Nine percent of
postsecondary students go to for-profit
colleges and universities—9 percent—
but 33 percent of all the federal student
loan defaults in the United States are
students from for-profit colleges and
universities—9 percent of the students,
33 percent of federal student loan de-
faults.
What is going on here?
Well, what is happening here, unfor-
tunately, is that many of these stu-
dents are signing up for the for-profit
schools that they think are legitimate
colleges and universities, and, frankly,
they are dramatically overcharging
them.
Every analysis we have gone through
says that the tuition at these for-profit
schools far exceeds what students are
likely to pay, certainly, in a commu-
nity college and in the case of many
public colleges and universities. So
they have a big tuition bill to start
with, and they have poor results.
What kind of results? Students grad-
uate believing that they are being
trained or educated to do a certain pro-
fession, and then they find out that
they can’t do the job or they don’t
qualify for the job, or they get so deep-
ly in debt on the way to graduating,
they give up and quit—the worst of all
possible outcomes.
So that is the preface on these for-
profit colleges and universities. I have
come to this floor many times over the
years to talk about this industry be-
cause we treat it in the eyes of the pub-
lic like higher education across the
board, and yet it is much, much dif-
ferent. It is for profit as opposed to not
for profit, and, frankly, the results of
that education leave a lot to be de-
sired.
It has been more than 5 years since
the for-profit giant Corinthian College
collapsed. Their economic model didn’t
work. For years, Corinthian had lied,
inflating its job placement rates and
engaging in high-pressure tactics to
lure students into enrolling, often leav-
ing them with massive student loan
debt and a diploma that didn’t work to
find a job.
But Corinthian was not unique. As I
have said many times, it turned out to
be the canary in the coal mine. Since
Corinthian College, we have seen the
collapse of several other major preda-
tory for-profit colleges and univer-
sities. They include ITT Tech,
Westwood, Education Corporation of
America, and Dream Center. Nearly
every major for-profit college company
has been the subject of extensive inves-
tigations and lawsuits for unfair and
deceptive practices similar to Corin-
thian College.
Check with the attorney general of
your home State about that for-profit
college and university, and, almost
without fail, you will find that they
have been investigated for misleading
and deceiving the students who go to
school at their universities.
I have long said that we shouldn’t
leave the students holding the bag for
the misdeeds of these institutions be-
cause, you see, we are complicit. The
Federal Government is part of the
problem.
How do these schools reach the point
where you can take out a Federal stu-
dent loan to attend? We accredit them.
We recognize their accreditation. We
tell the world and the families and the
students that these are legitimate
schools. Depending on that, these stu-
dents who sign up for a better experi-
ence, are often misled, deceived, and
overcharged. Ultimately, a third of
them are in default on their student
loans because they can’t pay them
back.
There is a provision in the Higher
Education Act known as borrower de-
fense. It gives the students the right to
have their Federal student loans dis-
charged by the Secretary of Education
if they have been defrauded or subject
to deception by these schools.
After Corinthian’s collapse, this lit-
tle known, rarely used provision in the
law became a hot topic. All of a sud-
den, here were large numbers of stu-
dents who had been defrauded and de-
ceived by Corinthian College and went
deeply into debt, and now the college
goes out of business.
It turns out that most of the hours
they took can’t be transferred any-
where. It is worthless. They were de-
frauded, start to finish, and now they
are left holding the student loan bag.
Thousands of Corinthian students
and other borrowers, mostly from for-
profit colleges, began applying for this
borrower defense discharge from the
U.S. Department of Education. It was
in the law. It led the Obama adminis-
tration to undertake a new rulemaking
to update the borrower defense regula-
tion, which dated back to 1994, and to
create a standard process for dealing
with the inundation and to attempt to
prevent future collapses.
Soon after taking office, Secretary
Betsy DeVos and the Trump adminis-
tration delayed implementation of the
Obama rule, despite the Department’s
own inspector general saying that im-
plementing the rule would ‘‘avoid costs
to students and taxpayers that result
from school closures.’’
Secretary DeVos said: I am not going
to be a party to that. Her delay was
challenged in court. Her decision to
delay this new rule was found illegal by
a Federal judge, after which the cur-
rent rule went into effect, and it re-
mains in effect today. Secretary DeVos
also announced she would begin a new
rulemaking to replace the current rule.
In late August, Secretary DeVos re-
leased her borrower defense rule, the
new rule which she wants to put in
place. It actually guts the borrower
and taxpayer protections in the cur-
rent borrower defense rule and makes
it nearly impossible for students hold-
ing this student loan debt who have
been defrauded to get relief.
How does she make it so hard?
It is estimated that the rule will pro-
vide $11 billion less in relief to de-
frauded borrowers—students—than the
current rule. Among other things, the
new Betsy DeVos rule increases the
burden on these defrauded students to
gather and submit almost impossible
amounts of evidence to somehow prove
their claim. Student borrowers will
have to provide evidence that the
school intentionally harmed them.
Now, how are they supposed to do
that?
The DeVos rule—the new one—re-
quires borrowers to apply individually
rather than receiving automatic dis-
charges when they are part of a group
of student borrowers who have been
harmed by similar practices by places
like Corinthian. In other words, you
are on your own. Get your own lawyer.
Lawyer up. Get some evidence to-
gether. Come see us, and maybe we will
be convinced.
Student borrowers who have been
cheated are not exactly the wealthiest
group in America. They are often fac-
ing incredible financial difficulties and
deep emotional strain, with a moun-
tain of debt and nothing to show for it
because of these for-profit schools. Now
Secretary DeVos wants them to be in-
vestigators and lawyers and get their
own relief one by one.

November 20, 2019
The DeVos rule also eliminates the
current prohibition on class action re-
strictions and mandatory arbitration
clauses in enrollment.
What does that mean?
Under the current rule which Sec-
retary DeVos wants to replace, you
could gather the other students from
Corinthian College and work on this
together as a class action claim, share
whatever expenses that might be in-
volved in proving your claim, and you
couldn’t be forced into an arbitration
where you are likely to lose. You could
have your day in court under the rule
that Secretary DeVos wants to replace.
Class action restrictions and manda-
tory arbitration were used by Corin-
thian and ITT Tech and others that re-
quired students to sign away their
rights to sue the school as an indi-
vidual or as part of a class as a condi-
tion of enrollment.
The DeVos rule prevents students
from holding schools directly account-
able for their wrongdoing and seeking
financial redress through the courts. It
gives students no other option than to
seek relief from taxpayers through bor-
rower defense, but, as I just mentioned,
it makes that process almost impos-
sible.
And if anyone doubts the devastating
effect this rule will have on the de-
frauded students’ ability to get relief,
just look at what Secretary DeVos has
done to date.
Since taking office Secretary DeVos
has had the authority to discharge
hundreds of millions of dollars in stu-
dent loan debt held by hundreds of
thousands of defrauded student bor-
rowers. Instead, she has allowed a
backlog of more than 200,000 borrower
defense claims from virtually every
State in the Nation—student borrower
defense claims coming from all 50
States—to build at the Department.
She is sitting on it. She is playing slow
ball. She has not approved a single
claim. Although more than 200,000
claims are pending, she has not ap-
proved a single claim in more than 1
year.
Here I want to show you what is be-
hind this. In the few cases where Sec-
retary DeVos has been legally required
to provide discharges, she has done so
with extreme displeasure.
Think about that. Using her author-
ity to help defrauded borrowers get a
fresh start brings her extreme dis-
pleasure.
How do I know that?
She wrote it. Here is one of them.
Recommendation to discharge. She ap-
proves it, signs it, and puts down as a
comment: ‘‘with extreme displeasure.’’
Discharging a student loan from a
for-profit institution that defrauded
borrowers, she is displeased to be
forced to do such a thing.
She defied a Federal court order and
was held in contempt for continuing to
collect from these students who had
been defrauded by Corinthian.
This is not a Secretary who rewrote
the borrower defense rule to help stu-
dent borrowers. In September, I intro-
duced a resolution in the Senate to
overturn the DeVos borrower defense
rule; 42 of my colleagues have cospon-
sored that resolution.
I plan to bring the resolution to a
vote on the Senate floor where we will
only need a simple majority to pass
under the expedited procedures pro-
vided for in the Congressional Review
Act. At that time, my colleagues will
have a choice. Will you stand with Sec-
retary DeVos or with the defrauded
student borrowers in your State?
There is no doubt where the Amer-
ican people stand. In a 2016 New Amer-
ica poll, the question was asked wheth-
er Americans agreed that students
should have their Federal student loan
debt canceled if their college deceived
them, exactly what the borrower de-
fense rule is about.
Seventy-one percent of Republicans
said yes, 87 percent of Democrats. On
average, 78 percent of Americans un-
derstand it is fundamentally unfair to
penalize these students, having been
defrauded by a school that this U.S.
Government said was doing business
honestly and professionally. When you
break the numbers down, it is clear.
The overwhelming majority of people
in this country stand by the students,
but not by Secretary DeVos.
I will stand with the defrauded stu-
dents and the American people over
Secretary DeVos, and my colleagues in
the Senate will get a chance to vote. I
hope they will, too.
Mr. President, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
SASSE). The Senator from South Da-
kota.
JUDICIAL CONFIRMATIONS
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, yester-
day, we confirmed Robert Luck, a Flor-
ida supreme court justice, to be a U.S.
Circuit judge for the 11th Circuit Court
of Appeals. With Justice Luck’s con-
firmation, the Senate has now con-
firmed 47 appellate court judges during
this administration and 163 Article III
judges overall.
That is more appellate court judges
than had been confirmed at this point
in any of the previous five Presidential
administrations, and it is a particu-
larly outstanding number when you
consider that the Democrats have
made confirming these judges as dif-
ficult as they possibly can. From day
one of this administration, Democrats
were determined to obstruct anything
this President did, his nominations in
particular.
Again and again and again, they have
attempted to block nominees for no
other reason than the fact that they
were nominated by this President.
Democrats have subjected roughly 75
percent of the administration’s judicial
nominees to the time-consuming clo-
ture process. Compare that to the
treatment of President Obama’s nomi-
nees. At this point in President
Obama’s administration, roughly 3 per-
cent of his judicial nominees had been
subjected to cloture votes—just 3 per-
cent, 3 percent versus 75 percent for
President Trump.
The difference in these numbers is
not because this President has nomi-
nated scores of extreme nominees who
Democrats felt they could not support.
In fact, Democrats have repeatedly
turned around and voted for the very
same judges they have obstructed. In
one particularly egregious example, in
January of 2018, Democrats forced the
Senate to spend more than a week con-
firming four district court judges, even
though not one single Democrat voted
against their confirmation. These
judges could have been confirmed in a
matter of minutes by voice vote, but
Democrats forced the Senate to spend
more than a week on their consider-
ation, time that could have been spent
on genuinely controversial nominees or
on some of the important issues facing
our country.
Despite Democrats’ obstruction, we
have continued to move forward, and
as I said, yesterday, we confirmed our
163rd judge to the Federal bench.
Today, we will confirm our 164th. We
are putting judges on the bench with a
real respect for the law and for the
Constitution and a commitment to ap-
plying the law as written.
Now, those sound like basic require-
ments for a judge, but too often, it
seems like my Democrat colleagues are
interested not in judges who will up-
hold the law, but in judges who will act
like superlegislators, rewriting the law
and the Constitution when they do not
fit with the Democrats’ political opin-
ions, and that is a very dangerous
thing.
When judges rule based not on what
the law actually says, but what they
think the law should be, they under-
mine a fundamental principle of our
system of government. Our system is
based on belief in the rule of law. In
the American system, the law is sup-
posed to be the final, impartial arbiter.
Cases are to be decided based on what
the law says, not on what a particular
judge feels.
Sure, it might seem nice when an ac-
tivist judge goes outside the meaning
of a law and rules for your preferred
outcome. But what happens when that
same judge reaches beyond the law to
your detriment? What protection do
you have if the law is no longer the
highest authority? Equal treatment
under the law, equal justice under the
law, these principles can only be main-
tained as long as judges actually rule
based on the law and not on their per-
sonal feelings or personal opinions.
My Democrat colleagues have shown
a disturbing tendency to believe that
their opinions are the only ones that
should prevail. They disapproved of the
outcome of the last election, and so for
3 years, they have done everything
they can to undermine a duly-elected
President. They are upset by the fact
that the President got to replace a per-
ceived swing vote on the Supreme
Court, and the solution floated by more
than one member of their party was to
pack the Supreme Court.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6686 November 20, 2019
For anyone who needs a refresher on
an idea that most thought had been
consigned to the dustbin of history dec-
ades ago, the theory of court-packing
is as follows: If the Supreme Court is
not deciding cases to your liking, add
more Justices to the Court until you
start getting the decisions that you
want.
Listen to Democrats question judi-
cial nominees, and it soon becomes ap-
parent that their biggest concern is not
finding judges who will uphold the law
and the Constitution, but judges who
will uphold Democrats’ political opin-
ions and preferred policy outcomes. It
is a disturbing trend. It is natural to
want your party to prevail and to be-
lieve that your ideas are the best ones
for the country. It is another thing en-
tirely to start acting like your opin-
ions are the only ones that should ever
prevail, regardless of election out-
comes or the wishes of the American
people.
I am proud that we are putting
judges on the bench who will rule ac-
cording to the law and to the Constitu-
tion, not their personal opinions, their
political beliefs, or the political party
of the individuals before their court. I
am proud that we are putting judges on
the bench who will help ensure that the
rule of law is maintained and that ev-
eryone in their courtroom receives the
equal protection of the law.
I look forward to confirming more
excellent judges in the near future.
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

ator from Montana.
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, Mon-
tanans are growing restless, as Speaker
PELOSI and the House Democrats con-
tinue to slow-walk a very important
trade agreement for Montana and for
our country. That is the United States-
Mexico-Canada Agreement.
In fact, just last week, I was in Bil-
lings to celebrate the Montana Farm
Bureau Federation’s 100 year anniver-
sary—and, again, another big congratu-
lations to the Montana Farm Bureau.
As I was talking with folks at the farm
bureau event, there were a lot of cow-
boy boots and hats. These are the farm-
ers and ranchers of Montana, the salt
of the earth folks. They are all asking
the same question: Why is it taking so
long? What is going on?
Frankly, there is one answer: Speak-
er NANCY PELOSI and House Democrats
are playing political games and holding
up this trade deal. They are holding
this trade deal hostage. It has been a
year since the USMCA was signed by
President Trump and leaders of Canada
and Mexico—a year. NANCY PELOSI has
had this signed trade agreement in her
hands for about a year, and rather than
deliver this win for our farmers and
ranchers in Montana and across the
United States, she is focused on one
thing: impeachment—because, at the
end of the day, this is about our farm-
ers and ranchers. It is time we get the
job done because, in Montana, agri-
culture is the No. 1 driver of our econ-
omy, and it is a large part of our Mon-
tana way of life.
This trade agreement is expected to
create over 180,000 new American jobs
and to boost our GDP by over $70 bil-
lion. Canada and Mexico both are in
high demand for our products like
wheat, barley, beef. In fact, in 2018
alone, Montana had $731 million in
total exports to Canada and to Mexico.
For our producers and our ag-related
industries in Montana, passing this
trade agreement would help provide
certainty and alleviate the challenges
and obstacles they have faced over a
very tough season.
Mexico is ready. Canada is ready. The
United States is ready. I can tell you,
Montana is ready. Unfortunately,
NANCY PELOSI is not. While the Demo-
crats continue to obsess over impeach-
ing our President, they continue to ig-
nore the voices of our rural commu-
nities. This unnecessary reality TV
show is nothing but a waste of time to
stall the important work like the
USMCA. Montanans are sick and tired
of the politics and the partisan games
being played here in Washington, DC,
and frankly, I am, too.
I am grateful for the leadership of my
good friend and colleague, GREG
GIANFORTE, who is standing up to
House Democrats and fighting boldly
for the USMCA. Realize, Montana has
but one Member in the U.S. House of
Representatives, and he is fighting a
good fight over there.
We are both fighting to ensure that
the votes of Montana farmers and
ranchers are heard loud and clear in
both Chambers of Congress. The longer
the House Democrats stall on this deal,
the further we stall opportunity and
economic growth in Montana and
across our Nation.
To Speaker PELOSI, to my colleagues
in the House, enough is enough. Let’s
deliver the USMCA for the American
people and for Montana farmers and
ranchers.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri.
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, first of
all, let me say that I totally agree with
my friend from Montana on the impor-
tance of, after a year of deliberation—
or maybe ‘‘deliberation’’ is too strong a
word—more than a year since all three
countries agreed on an agreement, that
we still have not gotten a chance to
vote on this agreement on the Senate
floor; we have to wait for the House to
do that. I want to do everything that I
can to encourage the House to move
forward with this. I think better trade
policy can turn a good economy into a
great economy, and we need to be
working on that great economy.
NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH
Mr. President, I am here today to
talk about another topic. I want to
talk for a few minutes about the im-
portance of November as National
Adoption Month and to recognize the
celebration of National Adoption Day,
which will take place on Saturday, No-
vember 23. I am pleased to work with
my colleague and Senate cochair of the
Congressional Coalition For Adoption,
Senator KLOBUCHAR, again, to intro-
duce this resolution supporting Na-
tional Adoption Month and National
Adoption Day. This is the 5th year Sen-
ator KLOBUCHAR and I have worked to-
gether on this legislation and the 5th
year where I hope our colleagues will
unanimously support it and do that
this week.
The Congressional Coalition on Adop-
tion is the largest bipartisan, bi-
cameral caucus in all of Congress, and
there is a good reason for that. In the
Senate Subcommittee, where agree-
ment is really too often hard to find,
the idea that every child deserves to
grow up in a safe, stable home with a
loving family is something that not
only everybody should be able to agree
with, but in the Congress, we have been
able to agree with that in a broad-
based sort of way.
Right now, there are more than
437,000 children in the foster care sys-
tem in our country. More than 125,000
of those are children who are ready and
waiting for families who want to get
this adoption completed; yet the aver-
age length of time it takes a child from
foster care to adoption, once the adop-
tion decision has been made by the
adopting family, is 19 months. I was in
a meeting just last week with the ad-
ministrator of this program in the ad-
ministration who is doing everything I
believe they can for the first time in a
while to do what they can to reduce
this wait.
I would also like to see the State De-
partment, frankly, become for vigorous
in encouraging foreign adoptions for
those kids all over the world who are in
need of families.
I don’t disagree with the idea that if
someone in Ethiopia wants to adopt an
Ethiopian child or someone in Guate-
mala wants to adopt a Guatemalan
child or someone in Russia wants to
adopt a Russian child, that is all fine.
But if they don’t have adoptive fami-
lies in the country they were born in,
let’s open the door in a more effective
way for American families who want to
be part of that.
There is some good news. For the
fourth year in a row, the number of
children who were adopted increased.
Four years in a row, more kids were
adopted than in the previous year. For
the second year in a row, the number of
children who entered foster families
decreased. I don’t want to say that in a
way that takes anything away from
people who are willing to be foster fam-
ilies, to give that security, that emo-
tional embrace to kids who don’t have
that at home. Foster families serve a
great purpose, but even foster families
often become adoptive families, and
they do this because they know that is
a situation that becomes permanent.
Knowing that you have a family for-
ever makes a difference.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6687
November 20, 2019
In my home State of Missouri, there
are almost 13,000 kids in the foster sys-
tem right now. I want to share a few of
their stories.
Gabe, who is a 10th grader in Mis-
souri, is a big fan of reading and big fan
of watching movies. He hopes to join
the military when he is older.
Natalie is 14. Natalie loves to read.
She loves to draw. She loves to write.
She loves to be outside. If she had a su-
perpower, she says she would choose in-
visibility. This second grader really
would like a permanent home. She
wants to be a veterinarian someday.
She is doing well in school. The thing
she really needs is a home she can al-
ways go back to.
Ragan and Haylee are sisters who
hope to have pets in their home. They
don’t have pets in their home right
now. Ragan is a sixth grader who likes
to laugh and draw and learn. Haylee is
a fifth grader who likes to play soccer
and spend time with her soccer team-
mates. Even sisters have different ways
they look at the world. They would all
like a family.
Last week, I had the privilege to
meet with three families from Missouri
who were here to be celebrated at the
Angels in Adoption activity that oc-
curred last week. This is something we
do annually to recognize families who
have gone above and beyond what you
could expect in the adoption commu-
nity. This was the first year there were
Angels in Adoption being recognized
from all 50 States and from Wash-
ington, DC. Of the three Missouri fami-
lies I had a chance to spend some time
with, one included Justin and Kristin
Akin from Chesterfield. I actually first
met Kristin when she came to my of-
fice to be an advocate for Be The
Match. Be The Match is a Federally au-
thorized and funded registry program
that matches unrelated bone marrow
donors with patients suffering from
leukemia and from 70 other fatal blood
cancers.
Kristin was here advocating for that
because she and Justin had lost two
sons, Andrew and Matthew, who were
diagnosed with a rare disease and were
unable to find matched donors. Kristin
and Justin, after losing those two sons,
adopted William and Christopher.
Kristin continues to be a volunteer
to help other families trying to find
that match. We are doing better with
that program. In fact, we increased
that program in our proposed budget
for this year by $5.4 million, as we in-
creased the National Cord Blood Inven-
tory Program also.
As important as that constant effort
to do what they can so that other fami-
lies didn’t have happen to them what
happened when they lost their two
children was their decision to bring
two more sons into their house and to
do that by adopting.
I also had a chance to meet Zach and
Joanna Holden. The Holdens began fos-
tering in May of 2010. They were al-
ready parents of three young girls of
their own, but they became foster par-
ents to make an impact on the lives of
children, knowing it wouldn’t be easy
for their family but it would be an im-
portant thing to do for the kids they
brought into their family. Through
their 9 years as foster parents, the
Holdens have had 30 different foster
kids in their house and adopted 2 of
those 30 kids through the foster care
relationships they had.
In early 2012, they began a small min-
istry out of their garage called The
Caring Closet, which later merged with
Fostering Hope, another local foster
care ministry. Joanna and that min-
istry—and the partnership now with
Fostering Hope—gathered and sorted
donations, put together packs of
clothes, distributed them to local fos-
ter families wherever there was a need.
Fostering Hope now supports children
in foster care. They help foster families
as they help foster kids, and they help
foster care agencies across several
communities in Southwest Missouri.
Jody and Mary Ann Allen-Parker
also shared their incredible story with
me. Nearly two decades ago, Mary Ann
witnessed a tragic circumstance in-
volving the friends of one of her sons.
He explained a challenging situation he
and his family were in, and he asked
Mary Ann if he could move in with
them. She took this child and, shortly
after that, his two siblings under her
care along with her own two children.
After going to court, Mary Ann was
able to establish custody over those
three kids as well. The oldest of them
has joined the Marines and the other
two are still at home with Mary Ann.
She has given them the structure and
focus they didn’t have in their original
home but they have through her, and
they also have reconnected with their
parents on a much different level than
they ever had before.
There are lots of stories to be shared.
There are lots of families who are wait-
ing to adopt. There are lots of families
who haven’t thought about it yet who
would be willing to adopt.
According to one survey, nearly one-
quarter of the people in the United
States who haven’t adopted have con-
sidered being an adoptive parent. There
are many concerns about adoption that
aren’t there once you get in, open that
door, and look at what can happen
when you create a forever family for
somebody who needs one.
The same survey showed that over
one-third of the participants believe
that foster care adoption is expensive,
and a majority of those considering
foster care adoption indicated that re-
ceiving financial and emotional sup-
port would make a difference in decid-
ing whether to adopt.
I will be sponsoring again this year
the refundable tax credit for adoptive
parents. About 50 percent of all the
parents who adopt don’t make enough
money to pay income tax, which says a
lot about them. It also says a lot about
the fact that the system we have now—
in which you get a tax credit, but you
get a tax credit only if you pay taxes—
serves to encourage only about 50 per-
cent of the families who are willing to
stretch in unique ways and adopt kids.
Senator KLOBUCHAR and I have intro-
duced the Supporting Adoptive Fami-
lies Act to ensure adoptive families
have access to pre- and post-adoption
services, including mental and physical
and behavioral health screenings and
assistance. In February, we also intro-
duced the Intercountry Adoption Advi-
sory Committee Act to improve the
intercountry adoption process.
Since National Adoption Day started
in 2000, tens of thousands of children
have been adopted. If only a few of
them are adopted because this month
and this day draw attention to that,
that is certainly worth the effort we
will make on the Senate floor this
week to recognize this important
month and to recognize next Saturday
as National Adoption Day.
With that, I yield the floor.

question is, Will the Senate advise and

HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as the
ranking Democrat on the Senate Fi-
nance Committee, I can tell the Senate
this morning that there is no higher
priority for Senate Finance Democrats
than the well-being of healthcare pa-
tients in this country and how strongly
we feel about their having a right to
good quality, affordable healthcare
coverage.
Right now, too many of those folks
are getting ripped off by an insurance
lobbyist’s dream—taxpayer-funded
junk insurance—or by Big Pharma,
which is always, always looking to en-
gage in price gouging for one reason:
They can get away with it. Take insu-
lin. Insulin prices are up thirteenfold
in recent years. The drug is not 13
times better. It is the same insulin
that has been around for decades. But
the reason the pharmaceutical compa-
nies do it is because they can get away
with it.
This morning, I am going to take a
few minutes and talk about what this
really means for patients because I can
tell you, this fall, there are a lot of
families across this country who would
rather be prepping for holidays than
worrying about their healthcare. Un-
fortunately, the Trump administration
is refusing to provide that kind of secu-
rity for our patients.
To begin, let me tell you about a
youngster in Oregon named Jasper.
Jasper is 3, full of energy and love, and
a big fan of playtime with cars and
trucks and trains. He was born, how-
ever, with huge medical challenges—
cystic fibrosis, cardiac and pancreatic
problems, hearing loss. He needs a vari-
ety of treatments multiple times a day.
It is so hard on Jasper’s family. It is so
hard on Jasper. And, of course, the
costs of Jasper’s care are in the strato-
sphere. The family is fortunate to have
health insurance through a parent’s
employer. They know how absolutely
vital it is to have what they consider
to be a lifeline—the protection of the
Affordable Care Act.
At the heart of the Affordable Care
Act are bedrock, ironclad protections
for people like them—no discrimina-
tion by insurance companies against
preexisting conditions. That was some-
thing we used to have some support for
from the other side of the aisle. I know
about that because I wrote a bipartisan
bill that had airtight, loophole-free
protection against what essentially
was discrimination against those with
preexisting conditions, and we got it
into the Affordable Care Act.
Yet now we see the other side of the
aisle trying to unravel those protec-
tions. They are trying to unravel the
protection that we see for patients
with respect to big expenses. Our ap-
proach has no annual or lifetime limits
on coverage, no coverage denials that
dragged people into bureaucratic
nightmares, has young people covered
on their parents’ plan until age 26, and
lots more. Those protections saved peo-
ple’s lives and made healthcare afford-
able for millions of Americans.
Unfortunately, with the support of
my colleagues here on the other side in
the Senate, the Trump administration
wants to eliminate those protections
that are so important to Jasper and
families like his. My colleagues on the
other side are standing by and basi-
cally doing nothing while the adminis-
tration and Republican-led States are
out there maneuvering in the courts to
get the entire Affordable Care Act
wiped out.
The so-called Texas case, which is an
absurd lawsuit based on an absurd ar-
gument—an argument that wouldn’t
pass the smell test in a middle class
school mock trial—somehow rightwing,
ideological judges have kept it alive.
Because this lawsuit keeps hanging
around, tens of millions of Americans
might lose their healthcare with hard-
ly any warning and no fallback options
to protect them.
Now Republicans have claimed they
have fix-it bills they could pass in the
event their allies took down the Af-
fordable Care Act. They do read like
they were written by the lawyers and
the lobbyists on the payroll of the big
insurance companies. If insurance com-
panies can hike up the cost of treating
a preexisting condition so high that it
becomes unaffordable, it is no different
from being denied coverage at the out-
set.
While the Texas case moves forward,
the Trump administration is con-
tinuing to allow junk insurance scam
artists to defraud Americans into buy-
ing worthless plans that aren’t worth
really the paper they are written on
and certainly don’t cover the
healthcare Americans need.
I want to be very specific about it.
This is an insurance lobbyist’s dream.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6689
November 20, 2019
You have tax breaks for junk insur-
ance. That is on every insurance lobby-
ist’s wish list for the holidays. I think
it is federally funded fraud, plain and
simple, but unfortunately it has the
support of a lot of Republicans here in
the Congress.
It is now the middle of the open en-
rollment period for health insurance on
healthcare.gov. The Trump administra-
tion’s support for junk plans has cre-
ated a whole new burden for families
across the country who are shopping
for insurance.
I am particularly troubled by this be-
cause I remember what junk insurance
used to be like. I was director of the
senior citizens at home for almost 7
years before I was elected to the Con-
gress, and those were the days when
you could go around the country,
whether it was Montana or Oregon or
anywhere else, and fast-talking sales-
men would sell 10, 15, sometimes 20
policies to supplement a senior’s Medi-
care. They were called Medigap poli-
cies, and they were useless. Seniors
should have saved that money to pay
the rent and maybe make sure they
had heat in their houses.
Finally, we got rid of those Medigap
rip-off policies. When I came to the
Congress, it was my top priority. We
got it passed. It was a bipartisan pro-
posal. But now junk plans are back.
They are different from those Medigap
rip-offs, but, much like what I battled
when I was the head of the senior citi-
zens in Oregon, they are still built
around the same proposition. They are
essentially worthless. They are an in-
surance lobbyist’s dream. In the case of
what we are dealing with—the adminis-
tration gutting the Affordable Care
Act—I think it is essentially Federal
tax breaks for junk insurance, and that
is why I think it is tantamount to fed-
erally funded fraud.
The Trump administration’s support
for junk plans has created a whole new
burden for families across the country
who are trying to shop for insurance
that gives them real value. Those shop-
pers used to be able to trust that junk
plans had actually been banned from
the marketplace. Now those shoppers
have to wade through Byzantine and
manipulative marketing scams and in-
comprehensible insurance lingo to try
to figure out if they are getting cov-
erage that actually helps them or, as I
have described too often, just worthless
junk.
What is worse, the Trump adminis-
tration actually redirects people look-
ing for coverage from the
healthcare.gov website to third-party
brokers who can sell unsuspecting cus-
tomers junk plans. I think it is as-
tounding that the Trump administra-
tion has seen fit to heap another bur-
den on vulnerable people. After we
have called this administration out on
it, they are not willing to do anything
to correct it.
But unfortunately, since the begin-
ning of the Trump administration—
with the help of too many allies in the
Congress—it has been one attempt
after another to take healthcare away
from vulnerable Americans, from mil-
lions of vulnerable Americans, those
like 3-year-old little Jasper and his
family, that I started talking about at
home in Oregon.
On a fundamental level, this is a de-
bate about whether this country is
going to go back to the days when
healthcare was only for the healthy
and wealthy. That was the way it
worked, if the insurance companies
could clobber somebody with a pre-
existing condition. If you are healthy,
it didn’t matter. You did not have to
worry. If you were wealthy, you just
sat down and wrote out a check. That
is the way it worked.
But when I came to the Senate, we
put together a bipartisan bill, airtight,
loophole-free protection for those with
preexisting conditions. There are col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle
who cosponsored my bill—and by the
way, the President of the Senate knows
who was the leader of that effort, one
of his predecessors in the Utah delega-
tion, the late Senator Bennet.
So this idea that we are just going to
sit around and go back to the days
when healthcare was for the healthy
and wealthy, that is not acceptable to
Finance Democrats that I have the
honor to work with. It is not accept-
able to any of us on this side, and it
should not be acceptable to my col-
leagues in the Congress.
That is where Donald Trump wants
to return to, the days when healthcare
was for the healthy and wealthy. They
have made it clear by working to
eliminate preexisting condition protec-
tions in the Congress and the courts,
by giving insurance lobbyists Federal
tax breaks for junk insurance plans,
and by seeking to slash health pro-
grams for the vulnerable.
I just want to make it clear that, on
this side of the aisle, we are about pa-
tients. We are about protecting pa-
tients. We are about the proposition
that in a country as strong and good
and rich as ours—where we are going to
spend $3.5 trillion this year on
healthcare, if you divide the number of
Americans, like maybe 325 million into
$3.5 trillion, you could send every fam-
ily of four in America a check for
$40,000. We are spending enough to take
care of patients.
We ought to be doing more to pro-
tect, rather than turning back the
clock on young people like Jasper and
his family. I just wanted to make it
clear, we will be on the floor talking
about more patients in the days ahead
and on the fight, a fight we are going
to prosecute relentlessly, to protect
those patients under the Affordable
Care Act.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). The Senator from Ohio.
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I was
walking by and heard Senator WYDEN—
I do not usually sit over here—Senator
WYDEN was speaking about healthcare.
It is just so clear to me some of the
things that this body could be doing to
bring down the cost of healthcare and
to expand the number of people that
have health insurance. I know, in my
State, I worked with, I know, a friend
of the Presiding Officer, Governor Ka-
sich, a Republican—I am a Democrat—
on expanding Medicaid in Ohio. In fact,
after the Affordable Care Act, we now
have 900,000 more people that have in-
surance.
But what I liked about what Senator
WYDEN was saying was some of the
things we could do in the future. It is
clear to me, if we allowed the govern-
ment to negotiate drug prices on behalf
of Medicare beneficiaries, directly with
the drug companies the way we do at
the Veterans Administration, it could
make a huge difference in drug costs.
We, in this body, a large part is be-
cause the drug company lobby refuses
to do it.
Mr. WYDEN. If my colleague would
yield?
Mr. BROWN. Yes.
MR. WYDEN. My colleague has been
an enormous champion for consumers,
and I just want to ask my colleague,
didn’t he and finance Democrats try in
the Finance Committee to get rid of
the restrictions on negotiating to do
exactly what he is saying?
Mr. BROWN. Yes, that is exactly
right. It should be an easy process. We
know how to do it at the Veterans Ad-
ministration. The cost is 40 or 50 per-
cent of what typically is the cost a pa-
tient pays.
The other thing we could do—and we
were this close to getting it in the Af-
fordable Care Act, is giving people the
option, at age 50 or 55, to buy into
Medicare because, as Senator WYDEN
knows, we all have in our States—
whether it is Utah or Oregon or Ohio,
we have 58-year-olds that lose their
jobs or 62-year-olds that lose their jobs,
and they cannot really often find insur-
ance, or it is not affordable if they can.
If they had the option to buy in—rath-
er in a neutral way we built it into the
Affordable Care Act, but lost in the
end. We fell one vote short. But it
would have made a huge difference in
people being able to get through that.
I will never forget, I had a townhall
in Youngstown some years ago. A
woman stood up and said, ‘‘I’m 62 years
old. I hold two jobs. I never had health
insurance. I just want to stay alive
until I’m 65.’’ She did not say I want to
stay alive to raise my grandkids or to
take a trip. It was to stay alive so I can
get on Medicare and get insurance, and
that just should not be in this country.
Mr. WYDEN. My understanding—and,
again, I have listened to my colleague
on the Finance Committee. He is a
champion on not going back, but going
forward with more Medicare-type
choices. Like making that person who
is really wondering if they are going to
make it until 65 in order to get to
Medicare, he would like—for example,
say an older woman who has been a
victim of age discrimination, did not
have much money, he would like to

make them eligible for Medicare at 60
or 61 or something like that.
Mr. BROWN. Absolutely—I thank
Senator WYDEN—absolutely. Just give
them that option. It is something we
ought to be able to do. We can do it in
a cost-effective way. In the end, it
means fewer trips to the emergency
room. In the end, it means a healthy
population of people at those 10 years
when they are more likely to get sick
and more likely to need Medicare, but
are not likely to be eligible.

REMEMBERING NATHAN LANE
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I rise
today to honor a Foreign Service Offi-
cer of the United States and a former
Pearson Fellow in my office, who was
tragically killed in an accident while
serving his country abroad.
After serving in my office for a year-
long fellowship, Nathan Lane was as-
signed to the Poland desk at the U.S.
State Department here in Washington.
Sadly, while on temporary duty in Po-
land, he was involved in a car accident.
While he was initially hospitalized, his
injuries proved too severe, and, sur-
rounded by his loving family, he passed
away on November 2.
Nathan was a committed public serv-
ant who joined the State Department
in 2000 and served in nearly every cor-
ner of the globe. He and his wife Sara
and, later, his son Peter travelled from
Mexico, to Russia, to Belarus, to Viet-
nam, and finally to Kenya. After his
assignment in Kenya, he had the ‘‘mis-
fortune’’ to be assigned to my office
through a Pearson Fellowship. Here,
my team and I got to see his diligence
and dedication every day firsthand.
During his time in my office, Nathan
proved invaluable. His knowledge and
expertise of foreign policy gave him a
mastery of the portfolio, as revealed by
his exceptionally researched policy pa-
pers on important international issues
and matters that my team and I tack-
led in the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
Nathan’s understanding of the dy-
namics of foreign relations and his
skills at compiling pertinent informa-
tion allowed him to craft the soon-to-
be-released report on China. This prod-
uct of the Subcommittee on East Asia,
the Pacific, and Cybersecurity Policy
will be a comprehensive report on the
activities of China in the Indo-Pacific
region. Absent Nathan’s diligence and
dedication, this report would not have
been possible.
Additionally, Nathan drafted a reso-
lution urging the formation of an un-
precedented treaty alliance between
the United States and Indo-Pacific na-
tions to collectively guard against
growing cyber threats. The Cyber
League of Indo-Pacific States, or
CLIPS, was Nathan’s brainchild. He
was passionate about this idea and
rightfully proud of this resolution, and
my team and I are honored to carry on
this torch.
Of course, Nathan contributed so
much more than just policy expertise.
His kind heart and curious nature
made him a friend to my staff and me.
He would readily help those around
him, even with the smallest tasks,
without a whisper of complaint and
quickly fit in as one of the team.
Nathan had many passions beyond
foreign policy. He loved chess, and
every so often, we would catch him
pulling up an ongoing game between
times of busyness. He loved running,
and it wasn’t uncommon for him to
step away from his desk at a conven-
ient time to go for a quick jog around
Capitol Hill.
Perhaps his greatest passion, though,
was baseball. Indeed, one of his most
timeless contributions to our office
was his membership of Coors & Corn,
the joint softball team between Sen-
ator SASSE’s office and mine. We may
not have won it all that year, but we
certainly would not have stood a
chance without Nathan. As we cele-
brate the World Series in Washington,
Nathan was such a great Nats fan that,
every time we cheer for that team, we
will also be cheering for him.
He was one of a kind. He was cheer-
ful, eager, and caring; his loss will be
felt by all of us who knew him. I ask
my colleagues to join me in praying for
his family, his wife, and his son and
commemorating the man who graced
so many of us with his compassion.
Mr. President, I yield the floor.
Mr. President, I suggest the absence
of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2843
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I
rise today to speak on the Violence
Against Women Reauthorization Act of
2019. This bill passed the House by a
vote of 263 to 158, with 33 Republicans
supporting it.
A week ago, along with every other
Senate Democrat, I introduced the bill
in the Senate. People on the frontlines
helping these victims wrote this bill.
This bill is not a Democratic bill. It is
not a Republican bill. This bill is a sur-
vivors’ bill. It is written with the help
of survivors who know what is needed
in the real world.
The bill accomplishes two things. It
preserves the advancements we made
during the last reauthorization in 2013,
and it includes certain meaningful im-
provements to the law. In particular,
there are three key elements.
One, it expands jurisdiction over non-
Native Americans for domestic vio-
lence offenses and crimes against chil-
dren, elders, and law enforcement. Vio-
lence is a big problem on Tribal lands,
and the best way to address it is to
allow the Tribes themselves to pros-
ecute these crimes. Unfortunately,
some, instead, want to circumvent the
Tribal justice system that we know
works, and this moves us in the wrong
direction.
Secondly, the bill builds on existing
antidiscrimination protections for the
LGBT community. In the 2013 reau-
thorization, Congress declared that
Federal grant recipients could use
funds to train staff to recognize and
combat discrimination against LGBT
individuals. Unfortunately, the law
wasn’t clear, and organizations are
still uncertain if they can use funds for
this purpose. This bill simply clarifies
that intent. It is a small but very im-
portant change to help this at-risk
community. There has been surprising
resistance from some on the Repub-
lican side to include this modest lan-
guage.
Third, our bill keeps guns out of the
hands of domestic abusers. It does this
by adding intimate partners and stalk-
ers to the existing list of individuals
who can be banned from possessing
firearms. We know the presence of a
firearm in a domestic violence situa-
tion increases the odds of a woman
being killed by 500 percent. That is a
major increase in risk. It only makes
sense to take guns away from con-
victed domestic abusers who may use
them to kill their spouses or partners.
There is simply no way to stop do-
mestic violence, but I think we have a
duty to do all we can, and this bill
makes significant improvements in the
law.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that at a time to be determined by
the majority leader, in consultation
with the Democratic leader, no later
than before the end of this year, the
Judiciary Committee be discharged
from further consideration of S. 2843
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration; that the only
amendments in order be two germane
amendments per side; that the debate
on the bill be limited to 1 hour and
amendments limited to 30 minutes
each, equally divided between the two
leaders or their designees; that upon
the use or yielding back of time, the
Senate vote in relation to the amend-
ments; that upon the disposition of the
amendments, the bill, as amended, if
amended, be read a third time and the
Senate vote on passage; and finally,
that amendments and passage be sub-
ject to a 60-affirmative vote threshold,
all with no intervening action or de-
bate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa.
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I am re-
serving the right to object.
I am on the floor today to speak my
piece about the Violence Against
Women Act. I speak to this body not
just as a Senator, but I speak to this
body as a survivor of rape and as a sur-
vivor of domestic violence.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6691
November 20, 2019
For months—for months—the senior
Senator from California and I worked
together on a piece of legislation that
would reauthorize the Violence Against
Women Act, a bipartisan effort, an ef-
fort that brought the Senator and I to-
gether to reauthorize the bill with as
much support in this body as possible.
We were working together in good
faith to make our way through the
issues that affect so many women in
abusive situations, partners in abusive
situations, domestic violence situa-
tions where children are involved, to
find a common path forward to have
this bill reauthorized, again, with as
much support as possible in this body
at a time when America views us as so
politically divided.
What could bring us together? The
issue of violence directed at women
and children and survivors of sexual as-
sault should bring us together.
Months of bipartisan effort—but
there was pressure to immediately in-
troduce the House-passed version of the
Violence Against Women Act. We were
moving ahead with steady progress in a
number of these areas, but, again,
there was political pressure to intro-
duce the House-passed version of the
bill, not one that we could come to-
gether with on the floor of this Senate
but one that even the Democrats—in
their release, in their press gaggle ad-
dressing the House version of Violence
Against Women—said would never
make it through the Senate. Why on
Earth would we introduce a piece of
legislation that will not make it
through this body? Shouldn’t we be
working together to find a path for-
ward?
We should continue to work on it. I
sincerely hope that by the end of this
year we can come together as Repub-
licans and Democrats and not present a
Republican version or a Democratic
version but produce a version that will
pass this body and protect those who
are in a very vulnerable state. I have
been in that vulnerable state before,
and I appreciated the assistance that
was given to me by folks who were
funded by this piece of legislation.
So, with that, I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
PERDUE). Objection is heard.
The Senator from California has the
floor.
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I
would ask the Senator to yield for just
a moment. I know we had some good
discussions, and they broke off. I am
very happy to continue to work on
this. I felt it was important to enter
the House bill because of the three very
important provisions that I just went
over, which are, in essence, the three
improvements on the bill, if you will.
I have no problem sitting down now
so that we can discuss it. If we could
find a way that we can agree, I think
that would be just fine. But in the in-
terest of time and because there has
been a substantial period of time, I just
decided to introduce it. The three
issues are Tribal sovereignty, the
LGBTQ people, and the gun provisions.
Those are the three new House provi-
sions.
I hope that Senator ERNST and I can
sit down and discuss it. I would be very
happy to do this—sit down and discuss,
if she would like.
Thank you.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa.
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I truly
appreciate the remarks by the senior
Senator from California. I truly have
enjoyed working on this piece of legis-
lation.
There were three markers that were
laid down within the House version of
the bill as outlined previously, but
there was no consensus there. It was,
‘‘Either accept these provisions or we
don’t work together.’’
We need to keep finding a way to get
to consensus on a bill moving through
this body, and I am happy to continue
working on legislation with the Sen-
ator. I think, by the end of this year,
we should find something that would
work to reauthorize this very impor-
tant piece of legislation, and I appre-
ciate her leadership on this very much.
I truly have enjoyed working with her.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California.
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may, in re-
sponse to the Senator—I am very
happy to accept the invitation. We can
sit down and continue to work on this,
but I would point out that these three
provisions have tremendous support:
the Tribal sovereignty, the protections
for the LGBT community, and spouse
protections when a spouse has a weap-
on. Those are rather difficult over here.
They were not in the House. But who
knows? Maybe we can work something
out, and I am happy to try.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa.
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, the Vio-
lence Against Women Act turned 25
years old this year. As many of us are
aware, this law provides desperately
needed resources to tackle domestic
and sexual abuse in our communities.
Folks, it needs to be reauthorized.
I wasn’t in the Senate the last time
this bill was passed back in 2013, and I
wanted to be part of the process of get-
ting the bill done this time around. As
a woman, as a survivor, and as some-
one who volunteered at a women’s shel-
ter in college, I understand just how
awful violence against women can be in
terms of physical and mental well-
being, self-image, our families, and se-
curity in the whole of society.
For months the ranking member of
the Senate Judiciary Committee and I
worked to develop a bipartisan pro-
posal that I really thought could get
across the finish line. Folks, as that
old ‘‘Schoolhouse Rock’’ video says:
Without passing the House, the Senate,
and getting a signature from the Presi-
dent, all you have is a bill, just a bill,
not a law. And no survivors are helped
by a bill.
Here we are today, after months of
work and mountains of effort that
went toward working on a bipartisan
bill, and at some point someone pressed
the big red button of partisan politics,
and the Democrats refused to work to-
gether any longer, walking away from
the real progress we had made. Not
only did they walk away from the ne-
gotiating table, but they did so by
dropping a bill that is going nowhere,
as they have acknowledged.
The Senate Democrats’ bill is a non-
starter. It will not pass the Senate. It
will not get the President’s signature.
Most importantly, it will not actually
help the survivors who need it.
These politics are sad. We should be
helping survivors, not engaging in the
kinds of partisan antics that will never
produce real results. We have seen this
before. The Democrats will say that
Republican women can’t speak for
women because we don’t agree point by
point with their leftist agenda. These
are worn-out tactics, my friends.
However, despite the minority’s deci-
sion to walk away and put politics
ahead of survivors, I am leading our ef-
fort to continue getting a bill done
that focuses on providing the resources
and support survivors across the coun-
try need for women and children in
urban and rural areas like mine.
My goal has always been to empower
survivors, to punish abusers, and to en-
hance the overall purpose behind this
very important law. That is why, this
week, I plan to put forward a bill that
puts survivors first. We have included a
number of issues Senate Democrats
failed to address. For example—and
this should be so simple, folks—we are
holistically addressing female genital
mutilation. We have tripled the
amount of funding that is available for
education and sexual assault preven-
tion. We also focus more on enhancing
the penalties for abusers.
As a matter of fact, one of the most
objectionable and unacceptable items
in the Senate Democratic bill is that
they allow accused abusers to go out-
side of the justice system and nego-
tiate directly with their victim—with
their victim—those women, those
abused survivors who have already
been manipulated and beat down. It al-
lows those abusers to negotiate di-
rectly with their victims to avoid jail
time; that is, of course, as long as the
victim consents, as if an abusive rela-
tionship ever involved consent—outside
of the justice system, folks, outside of
the justice system. It is unimaginable
that we would allow or fund such an
abusive system or abusive situation
and allow abusers to escape justice. I
think abusers should face justice, and I
am not sure why our Senate Demo-
cratic colleagues don’t agree.
Coming from a rural area of our
country, I made sure we prioritized
rural resources in our bill. We are of-
fering increased funding for housing as-
sistance so that women and children
can be safe from their abusers. When
living in an area like mine—rural
Montgomery County, Red Oak, IA—the
nearest shelter is an hour away. You

have virtually cut off a woman and her
children from any job she might have,
any family she might have, and it truly
takes them out of their life. By offer-
ing these housing resources through
voucher programs, our bill enables
them to rent an apartment or home in
their home community.
Imagine what we could do in this
body if we worked with a single pur-
pose instead of a dozen different mo-
tives. Imagine this entire body pulling
together with a single purpose, focus-
ing on assisting those survivors.
I welcome the support of all of my
colleagues for my bill—Democrats and
Republicans—and I hope we can all join
together in this effort. How many more
violent abusers can we put behind bars
to keep survivors safe? How many more
people would be alive today?
I want to thank my colleagues for
joining me today to speak on the im-
portance of the Violence Against
Women Act. I want to send the mes-
sage to the countless survivors across
this country: We are with you. We hear
you, and we are working for you.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would
like to begin by thanking our friend
and colleague from Iowa, Senator
ERNST, for her leadership on the reau-
thorization and—indeed, I think the
important point should be made—to
strengthen the Violence Against
Women Act. We don’t have to settle for
the House bill. We can have a better
bill for victims of domestic violence.
Unfortunately, like so much important
work, we seem constantly to get di-
verted and distracted and dragged
down by the partisanship that seems to
dominate Washington, DC, these days.
For many months, our colleague from
Iowa has been working closely with
Senator FEINSTEIN from California to
try to figure a way to reauthorize this
critical law.
In the meantime, though, not on one
occasion but on two occasions, we have
offered a continuing resolution that
would extend the current reauthoriza-
tion and our Democratic colleagues
have shut that down. So we are in un-
chartered territory where we don’t cur-
rently have an authorization for the
Violence Against Women Act.
I shared our colleague’s disappoint-
ment when our Democratic colleagues
walked away from the negotiating
table and chose to introduce a replica
of the House’s partisan bill, which as
you have heard, does not have the sup-
port to pass in the Senate. Let me say
one thing that should be abundantly
clear but sometimes I think it gets
lost: We all agree that more must be
done to prevent violence and respond
to it. It is fair to say that we have dif-
ferent opinions on what those path-
ways look like, but one thing that
should not be up for debate is whether
or not we reauthorize the Violence
Against Women Act. That is something
we need to do.
The fact is that we don’t have to set-
tle for the House bill. We can do better.
Our Democratic colleagues took an in-
teresting approach in introducing a bill
that a majority of people in this Cham-
ber will not support, and they know
that. Sadly, that is part of the point.
They know they have a bill that does
not enjoy consensus support because
they would rather make the political
point and argument that somehow
some of us on this side don’t believe in
supporting victims of domestic vio-
lence, which is absolutely a falsehood.
It is a lie. During a press conference,
the Senator from Hawaii even conceded
five times that the House bill is going
nowhere, but that is the path our
Democratic colleagues have chosen.
Rather than working in a bipartisan
fashion to build a consensus package
that could actually become law, they
decided to head down a partisan path
led by the House bill, which came to us
7 months ago.
Clearly, some of our colleagues here
in the Senate are not interested in ac-
tually making laws. They are in it for
the headlines, for the politics. In the
face of this ridiculous and unaccept-
able jockeying, I am glad that today
Senator ERNST will introduce a con-
sensus alternative to the bill offered by
our colleagues, and I am proud to be a
cosponsor of the legislation. This bill
introduced by the Senator from Iowa
will send more funding and more re-
sources to the Violence Against Women
Act than the Democrats’ bill. It is ac-
tually better and will authorize a pro-
gram for twice as long. It will give the
Department of Justice the stability it
needs to plan for the future without
being jerked around by partisan gains.
This bill includes a lot more than
just funding. It also addresses a num-
ber of horrific crimes that are being
committed against women and girls in
our country. Sex trafficking, for exam-
ple, is currently not always recognized
as a form of sexual assault—and it is—
but this bill would make that clear. It
would also enhance the maximum
criminal penalties for sexual abuse of
minors and other vulnerable groups. It
will, as you heard, take aim at heinous
crimes like mutilation and address
crimes in rural areas and on Tribal
lands. This legislation includes provi-
sions from a number of bipartisan bills
that have been introduced in the Sen-
ate to both improve resources for vic-
tims and target specific types of abuse.
One example is a bill I introduced
with the Senator from California, my
friend Senator FEINSTEIN, called the
HEALS Act, which will remove some of
the hurdles that exist between victims
of domestic violence and their access
to safe housing. That is in our bill.
This provision would also include
greater flexibility for transitional
housing programs so that survivors can
get back on their feet without the fear
of losing the roof over their head.
This bill includes language intro-
duced by Senators MURKOWSKI and COR-
TEZ MASTO to combat the epidemic of
murdered and missing Native women
and girls. It will allow for better law
enforcement coordination and provide
local and Tribal law enforcement with
more resources to address these crimes.
It is critical that we all call attention
to these despicable acts of violence and
unequivocally reject them without re-
gard to partisanship or party.
Another challenge we face is tech-
nology outpacing our ability to
counter certain types of exploitation.
Abusive images and videos proliferate
online, for example. This is a relatively
new challenge, but it is real and it is
omnipresent. This legislation will em-
power victims of this type of abuse to
remove the content from the internet
by using copyright takedown author-
ity. It also establishes an innovation
fund for the Office on Violence Against
Women to address emerging trends so
victims can get the support they need
as quickly as possible.
If you compare this legislation to the
bill passing the House and introduced
by our Democratic colleagues here,
there is no question that our version
does more to support survivors of do-
mestic violence and sexual assault. It
provides more funding over a longer pe-
riod of time, and it targets despicable
crimes that are being committed
across the country that aren’t even
covered by the House bill.
Let me just close by thanking our
friend from Iowa for continuing to
fight for victims of domestic violence
and sexual assault and for leading the
effort to reauthorize the Violence
Against Women Act. It is a bill that
never should have lapsed, despite two
attempts to continue it that our Demo-
cratic colleagues objected to. I am
proud to be a cosponsor of this bill and
look forward to working with all of our
colleagues to advance it. I hope our
colleagues will return to the negotia-
tion table and work with us so we can
send a long-term reauthorization of the
Violence Against Women Act to the
President’s desk for his signature.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota.
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to
join my colleagues from Iowa, Texas,
and Alaska in calling for the reauthor-
ization of the Violence Against Women
Act, or VAWA. VAWA was foundation-
al to addressing domestic violence and
sexual assault and supporting survivors
in their recovery.
VAWA expired earlier this year, and
it is critical that the services and tools
offered through the law are reauthor-
ized so we can continue to help and em-
power survivors. Additionally, it is im-
portant that we make it known that
crimes of domestic violence, sexual as-
sault, dating violence, and stalking are
not tolerated.
Senator ERNST will be introducing
this legislation, which I am cospon-
soring, to reauthorize the Violence
Against Women Act. This bill includes
key Tribal provisions, such as expand-
ing Tribal criminal jurisdiction and up-
holding Tribal sovereignty while

November 20, 2019
amending the 2013 VAWA, and pro-
viding increased funding for Indian
Tribes to address violence committed
against Indians on their lands.
A Department of Justice report found
that more than four in five American
Indian and Alaska Native women expe-
rience violence in their lifetime, and
Native women are significantly more
likely to experience cases of stalking
and physical violence by an intimate
partner.
Under Senator ERNST’s VAWA bill,
Indian Tribes will be allowed to train
more lawyers and Tribal court judges,
further strengthening the Tribal crimi-
nal justice system; have access to in-
creased data and reporting on the sub-
ject of missing and murdered Indians;
and will require the Department of
Justice to issue annual reports to Con-
gress in order to thoroughly track the
progress of the special criminal juris-
diction and better determine trends of
violence committed on Indian lands.
The Committee on Indian Affairs has
held hearings on violence against Indi-
ans and missing and murdered Native
Americans. As chairman of the com-
mittee, I introduced legislation that
would increase resources to Indian vic-
tims of crime. The Senate majority
VAWA includes my SURVIVE Act,
which would provide Indian Tribes with
a 5-percent Tribal set aside of the
Crime Victims Fund. Prior to our work
on this initiative, Tribes were access-
ing less than 1 percent of this impor-
tant funding. As a member of the Ap-
propriations Committee, I have in-
cluded a Tribal set-aside in the three
previous fiscal years of criminal justice
science packages, which underscores
the importance of passing authorizing
language, such as my SURVIVE Act.
This VAWA bill also includes Savan-
na’s Act, a bill I am cosponsoring,
named for Savanna LaFontaine-
Greywind, a pregnant woman from the
Spirit Lake Nation in my home State
who went missing and was found mur-
dered 8 days later. Savanna’s tragic
death did not go unnoticed and has
helped to raise awareness about miss-
ing and murdered Native American
women. Savanna’s Act will help to ad-
dress cases of missing or murdered In-
dians by directing the Attorney Gen-
eral to review, revise, and develop law
enforcement and criminal justice
guidelines; improving access to Federal
criminal databases; holding Tribal con-
sultations with Indian Tribes, Tribal
Organizations, and Urban Indian Orga-
nizations when the Department of Jus-
tice develops and implements guide-
lines; requiring training and technical
assistance to Indian Tribes partici-
pating in the guidelines implementa-
tion process; and mandating data col-
lection and reporting by the Depart-
ment of Justice.
The Senate majority VAWA includes
these important Tribal bills, and I am
proud to be a cosponsor of Senator
ERNST’s bill. There are many great pro-
visions in this VAWA bill, and I hope
my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle will give it serious consideration.
We must act to reauthorize VAWA in
order to help support survivors and
provide them with the assistance they
need to recover. Reauthorizing VAWA
also sends the important message that
crimes of domestic violence, sexual as-
sault, dating violence, and stalking are
not tolerated in this country, and that
we will continue to support survivors.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska.
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I
want to join my colleagues here on the
importance of the VAWA reauthoriza-
tion. In particular, I want to thank
Senator ERNST for her months of hard
work that she has put into this bill
that we are introducing today. I am a
proud cosponsor on that bill.
You saw in her remarks earlier her
passion, her energy, and her focus on
rural America, which is very important
to me and my great State of Alaska. I
am hopeful, as all of my colleagues
here are, including our friend from
California, Senator FEINSTEIN, that we
in the Senate are going to get to a
place where we can have a bipartisan
bill that is going to reauthorize VAWA.
This is hugely important for America,
and it is hugely important for Alaska.
I come down to the floor every week
and I talk about someone who is doing
something great in my State. I like to
brag about the great State of Alaska.
It is an amazing place, but, I will tell
you, there is one area where we are not
so amazing. My State, unfortunately,
has the highest rates of domestic vio-
lence and sexual assault of any State
in America. It is horrendous. The num-
ber of victims and the carnage that
this leaves in Alaska and throughout
our country are something we should
be able to come together and fix. We
can do this.
I want to talk about a provision in
Senator ERNST’s bill that is something
that I have been working on with her,
but, importantly, with many Senators,
including a lot of my Democratic col-
leagues. It is title XII of the bill. It is
called the ‘‘Choose Respect’’ title. This
is a series of bills that I have intro-
duced with Senators GILLIBRAND, HAR-
RIS, and COONS, my Democratic col-
leagues, and it is focused on trying to
change the culture and get more legal
resources to victims and to survivors.
Why is that so important? When you
look at the studies that show what is
the best way for a survivor to break
out of the cycle of violence that they
often find themselves in, one of the an-
swers is to get them an attorney. It
empowers them. It enables them to use
the justice system to their advantage.
Yet here is the problem. When you
look—literally, on a daily basis—at the
lack of legal representation for victims
and survivors of domestic violence and
sexual assault, it is endemic across the
country. So a number of the elements
of this bill, particularly under the
‘‘Choose Respect’’ title, are going to
try to change this.
Last year, we had legislation that I
authored that was passed into law and
was then signed by the President. It
was called the POWER Act and was
about getting more legal resources for
survivors. It was a good start, but it
didn’t do enough. The bill this year—
again, a bill that I cosponsored earlier
with Senator HARRIS of California—fo-
cuses on this issue.
Think about this: If you have an ac-
cused abuser—let’s say an accused rap-
ist—and if there is an indictment,
under the Sixth Amendment of the
U.S. Constitution, that perpetrator
gets a right to counsel. OK. That is our
Constitution. That is fine. What does
the victim get? What does the survivor
get? Right now, the victim gets noth-
ing. Far too often, victims go without
any legal representation, and that is
often the beginning of a cycle they fall
into.
One of the provisions of this would
be, once there is an indictment of a
crime of violence, that the Federal
Government would help to ensure the
goal of having the victim also get an
attorney through State domestic vio-
lence counsels. These are just some of
the elements of this bill.
Senator GILLIBRAND and I have legis-
lation that is part of this. It is called
the Choose Respect Act, which would
have a public advocacy program to try
to get young men in particular to start
changing our culture. It is not just a
problem in Alaska; it is a problem
throughout the country.
There are many things in this bill
that are very bipartisan, and I cer-
tainly am committed to working with
Senator CORNYN, Senator HOEVEN, Sen-
ator BLACKBURN, Senator FEINSTEIN,
and Senator ERNST in order to get to
the compromises we need to make in
the Senate to pass this bill. That is
what we want to have done. That is
why we are all here on the floor, talk-
ing about this passionately. I think we
can do it because it is too important to
miss this opportunity to pass legisla-
tion that is going to help some of the
most vulnerable people in our country
and in my State, and I am certainly
committed to working with everybody
here to make it happen.
I yield the floor.

ator from Tennessee.
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that I be al-
lowed to complete my remarks before

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6694 November 20, 2019
Most women will tell you that they
know of a female friend or acquaint-
ance or relative who has experienced
the horrors of sexual assault or domes-
tic violence or even trafficking.
Through my work with shelters back
home in Tennessee, I have learned that
the volunteers, the counselors, the ad-
vocates, and the attorneys who support
these victims are of the utmost impor-
tance. They are who the victims need
to see the minute they walk through
that door, into their arms, and hear
them say: How can we help you? This is
a safe place.
These are the people who come
around them to empower them, and the
one thing I hear over and over in the
wake of one’s attack is that these vic-
tims need that type of support. This is
why, in addition to providing funding
for both prevention and educational
programs, this year’s authorization
will do some important things. It will
increase funding for the court-ap-
pointed special advocates by $3 million.
It will provide over $1 million per year
for Federal victim counselors. It will
also help to provide transitional hous-
ing to victims, which is something
they will desperately need. They need
to know they have a safe place.
These resources—and this is impor-
tant—are going to go directly into the
hands of those who are providing these
services, and this will have a direct im-
pact on the lives of these women when
they need it the most.
Just for a moment, I would like to
highlight a portion of the reauthoriza-
tion on which I have spent a good deal
of time working this year. It has to do
with a particular violent sexual crime
that is so grotesque that most Ameri-
cans prefer not to even acknowledge it.
They don’t want to admit that this ex-
ists. Yet, for the victims of female gen-
ital mutilation, the pain and the hu-
miliation are nearly unbearable.
You would think that Federal pros-
ecutors would be able to make short
work out of such heinous charges, but
due to a loophole in Federal criminal
law, scores of victims have watched
their abusers walk free. The Federal
Prohibition of Female Genital Mutila-
tion Act of 2019, which is a separate bill
that I sponsored earlier this year, is
now a part of this year’s reauthoriza-
tion of the Violence Against Women
Act. It will correct fatal constitutional
flaws in the Federal statute that bans
the practice of FGM. When this is done,
under Federal law, prosecutions for
mutilation and cutting will be able to
continue.
I would be remiss if I did not say that
in a perfect world, we would not have
to worry about allocating resources for
safe houses and for victim counseling.
We should not have to do this, but this
is not a perfect world. So, yes, indeed,
we do have to step up and do this for
the sake of the thousands of women
who fall victim to sexual violence, traf-
ficking, and sexual abuse each year.
I urge all of my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle to come together and
work on this. Let’s pass the 2019 Vio-
lence Against Women Act.
I yield the floor.

BACKGROUND CHECKS
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, last
week, my colleague Senator
BLUMENTHAL stood on the floor of this
Chamber to talk about the epidemic of
gun violence in our country. Gun vio-
lence is an issue that hits close to
home for my friend from Connecticut.
Seven years ago, his home State was
the site of one of the most horrific acts
of gun violence anyone can imagine. A
young man armed with an assault rifle
opened fire in Sandy Hook Elementary
School, murdering 20 first graders and
6 adults.
While he spoke on the floor of this
Senate, Senator BLUMENTHAL was
handed a note informing him that, at
that very moment, an active shooter
was on the loose at another school—
this one in Santa Clarita, CA. This
marked the 243rd instance of gun vio-
lence at a school in this country since
the massacre at Columbine High
School in 1999. Sadly, today, school
shootings have become almost routine
and commonplace. It has gotten to the
point that students are fearful but,
sadly, not surprised when a shooting
occurs at their school.
Following an attack last year at
Santa Fe High School in Texas that
killed eight students and two teachers,
17-year-old student Paige Curry was
asked whether there was a part of her
that couldn’t believe this happened at
her school. Her response was heart-
breaking. She said:
There wasn’t.
She said:
It’s been happening everywhere. I’ve al-
ways felt it would eventually happen here
too.
This is the country we now live in: a
country where we have more guns than
we have people; a country where a
mass shooting—that is a shooting in-
volving the death or injury of four or
more victims—occurs, on average,
more than once every day; a country
where school shootings occur fre-
quently enough that students feel it
will eventually happen at their own
school.
This is not the country any of us
should want to live in. Yet the U.S.
Senate—one of the few institutions

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6695
November 20, 2019
that can actually do something to help
prevent gun violence—does nothing.
Gun violence kills 100 people in our
country every day—every day. That is
3,000 people a month and 36,000 people a
year.
This is a crisis, but my colleagues on
the other side of the aisle are not
treating it like one. Perhaps looking at
the numbers—100 people dying every
day—is just way too abstract.
How would the majority leader react
if the entire population of Sparta, KY—
all 231 residents—disappeared in less
than 3 days?
How would the chairman of the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee react if all
128 residents of Livingston, SC, dis-
appeared in a little over a day?
How would my colleagues from Texas
react if Bartlett’s 2,600 residents were
killed in just under a month?
This is the scale of what is happening
in our country every single day, week,
and year. This is a crisis, and it is past
time Senate Republicans start treating
it like one.
Here is what we can do right now. We
can join the House in passing H.R. 8, a
bill that would close loopholes in the
background check system. More than
90 percent of the American public sup-
ports this bill. Although it passed the
House 266 days ago—almost a year
ago—the majority leader refuses to
even bring the bill to the Senate floor
for a vote.
We can also pass S. 66, which would
reinstitute the Federal assault weap-
ons ban that expired in 2004. I have
joined Senator FEINSTEIN and 34 of my
colleagues in cosponsoring this com-
monsense measure, but the Republican
majority refuses to hold a hearing or
otherwise consider it.
We can finally pass an extreme risk
protection order bill that would allow
police or family members to petition a
court to remove firearms from people
who may be a danger to themselves or
to others, and despite repeated prom-
ises after each mass shooting that we
will get a vote, the vote never comes.
We all know none of these bills alone
will end gun violence in our country,
but they will help keep guns out of the
hands of those who are a danger to
themselves and others. They will make
those guns that remain available for
sale far less lethal. In other words, the
bills will make us safer.
Republicans refuse to take any of
these commonsense steps. Instead,
they cower before the NRA, an organi-
zation that curries favor with gun
manufacturers and gun rights extrem-
ists by opposing seemingly every piece
of gun safety legislation that is intro-
duced; this, in spite of the fact that a
strong majority of the NRA’s claimed 5
million members actually support
stronger gun safety protections.
We all remember the aftermath of
the Sandy Hook massacre, where it
seemed for a brief moment Congress
might pass a gun safety bill for the
first time in a generation. Senators
MANCHIN and TOOMEY introduced a
modest background check proposal
that actually came to the Senate floor
for a vote, but what happened? The
NRA came out against the bill, and
nearly every Republican Member of the
Senate fell in line to defeat it.
The vote came in the aftermath of a
shooting that took the lives of 20 inno-
cent elementary school children, and
my Republican colleagues chose to side
with the NRA and its $50-plus million
in campaign donations.
Today those first graders who were
killed would be in the eighth grade,
and yet we still haven’t passed a back-
ground check law. We have seen the
NRA block commonsense gun safety
bills time and again. Most recently,
President Trump voiced support for
strengthening background checks in
the wake of mass shootings in El Paso,
Dayton, and Gilroy. He tweeted that
‘‘Republicans and Democrats must
come together and get strong back-
ground checks.’’
Days later, he spoke on the phone
with the NRA executive vice president
and CEO Wayne LaPierre and quickly
changed his tune. Suddenly, our loop-
hole-ridden background system became
‘‘very, very strong,’’ to quote the
President. He no longer saw a need for
additional legislation.
The President of the United States is
often called the most powerful man in
the world. Yet, in the face of opposi-
tion from the NRA, Donald Trump
proved himself anything but.
Like so many people across the coun-
try, I am angry and frustrated that Re-
publicans in Congress seem to care
more about satisfying the NRA than
taking commonsense steps to keep our
communities safe.
Every day that Republicans in Con-
gress refuse to act costs lives. In the 6
days following the November 14 shoot-
ing in which two people were killed and
three others wounded at Saugus High
School, there have been at least four
more mass shootings.
On November 16, five were killed and
one wounded in a murder-suicide in
Paradise Hills, CA. On November 17,
four were killed and an additional six
were wounded when gunmen opened
fire at a backyard party at Fresno, CA.
That same day, four were injured when
a gunman fired shots into a home out-
side Cleveland, OH. On November 18,
one was killed and four injured in a
shooting in Newark, NJ.
These shootings happen quickly—16
seconds in the case of the Saugus High
School shooting in Santa Clarita. This
is hardly enough time to expect the
proverbial ‘‘good guy with a gun’’ to
protect innocent men, women, and
children caught in the line of fire.
Failing to take decisive action to
confront the crisis of gun violence in
our country makes the Senate
complicit in its continuation. Instead
of making more excuses for the Sen-
ate’s inaction, my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle should stop hid-
ing behind the NRA and join us in pass-
ing commonsense gun safety legisla-
tion that will save lives.
As our country endures mass shoot-
ing after mass shooting, I have to ask,
at what point do we say, ‘‘Enough’’?
When will my Republican colleagues
turn their backs on the NRA’s leader-
ship, listen to the 90 percent of the
American people and the rank-and-file
NRA members who join them, and pass
gun safety laws? The cost of continued
inaction is far too high.
I say to my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle: Wake up. What is it
going to take? What is it going to
take?
I yield the floor.

HEALTHCARE
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I
come to the floor today as the 2020
Democratic Presidential candidates
prepare to debate this evening. We are
sure to hear once again about their
proposals for massive taxing and spend-
ing. At the top of the list is their $34
trillion Medicare for All, which is real-
ly a one-size-fits-all healthcare scheme
for the people of our country. Here is
the key point. Democrats will dramati-
cally raise taxes on all Americans. One
candidate plans to increase taxes on
working families by $26 trillion over
the next year—that is new taxes—new
taxes—of $26 trillion. This candidate
also proposes an additional $2 trillion
on top of the $26 trillion by hiring an
army of IRS agents to crack down on
hard-working Americans who this one
candidate, as a Member of this body,
says can actually pay more and are not
paying their full share. So Americans
will pay $28 trillion more in taxes over
a decade. Do not be deceived. These
taxes will hit all Americans.
Democrats know they can’t win this
election on policy. Specifically, they
are dangerous Democratic socialist
policies that they are going to be pro-
moting in the debate tonight. So what
are they doing? Well, they are counting
on their totally partisan impeachment
process. We have been hearing all
about it now for months—actually, for
years.
Democrats have been obsessed with
impeaching—impeaching—President
Trump since day one, the day he was
elected. Then fast forward to his inau-
guration in 2017. The campaign to im-
peach President Trump, starting from
the day he was elected, really took
force the day he was sworn into office.
Democrats want to overturn the last
election, and they want to interfere
with the upcoming election. Election
day 2020 is now less than a year away.
Still, Democrats’ impeachment obses-
sion continues to burn on.
This is an unfair, bitterly partisan
process. I will tell you, the Americans
I talk to at home in Wyoming see right
through it. When I talk to my col-
leagues around the country, their con-
stituents at home see right through it
as well.
Recent polling shows that the public
wants the voters—not House Demo-
crats and not Speaker PELOSI—to make

their own call on election day. The
Democrats, meanwhile, seem to prefer
impeachment to doing the work of the
American people—the work all of us
were elected to do.
Republicans prefer to work on the
issues we were elected to address: jobs,
the economy, and our Nation’s secu-
rity. We are going to continue to work
for the people who elected us.
APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. President, on another matter, I
come to the floor as we approach an-
other government funding deadline.
The fact is, it is already past time to
fund the government, especially our
military.
Republicans have worked all year to
complete the annual appropriations
process and to get it done on time.
Here is the problem: Republicans can’t
pass the annual funding bills alone. We
need cooperation from the Democrats.
We need the House Democrats’ co-
operation, and here in the Senate, we
need to clear the 60-vote hurdle. So we
need Senate Democrats to be involved
in the process as well. But Democrats
prefer impeachment grandstanding
rather than governing. That is what we
are facing here today.
We are nearly 2 months into fiscal
year 2020, and we have yet to pass any
of the 2020 funding bills. The govern-
ment has been running under what is
called a short-term continuing resolu-
tion. This current continuing resolu-
tion is set to expire Thursday—tomor-
row. We will, undoubtedly, pass an-
other stopgap continuing resolution
this week, but these are only a tem-
porary fix. They are needed to keep the
government’s lights on but at last
year’s funding levels. Meanwhile, there
is no end in sight to Democrats’ 3-year-
long impeachment obsession. Their im-
peachment fever rages on.
They are so consumed by this bit-
terly partisan process that they cannot
focus on the priorities of the American
people. They are too consumed to fix
our aging roads and bridges, too ob-
sessed to pass ‘‘America First’’ trade
deals, and too fixated to fund the gov-
ernment on time. Above all, people ex-
pect us to fully fund defense—the de-
fense of our Nation. Yet the Democrats
continue to stonewall.
Republicans are fighting to fully fund
the military; Democrats are waging
war on the Commander in Chief. Re-
member, both parties came to the table
and completed a bipartisan budget deal
this past summer. The deal meant that
we could fund the government on time.
The deal supported critical defense
funding to keep our Nation safe, and it
included a major pay raise for our
troops.
So what happened? It is pretty clear.
The Democrats went back on their
word. And in so doing, they broke faith
with the American people and broke
faith with our troops—those in harm’s
way today.
Back at home in Wyoming, a deal is
a deal. Your word means something. A
handshake means something. You
never go back on your word, certainly
not when you make promises to our
men and women in uniform. Neverthe-
less, the Democrats have since
poisoned the well with unreasonable
partisan demands. They are tying our
Americans’ hands, repeatedly blocking
key defense votes. Democrats filibuster
and Democrats impeach while neglect-
ing the troops.
U.S. forces, meanwhile, are facing
heightened threats with last year’s
funding levels. The fact is, while nec-
essary, these continuing resolutions
take a real toll on our military. The
current CR means a $22 billion cut
from this summer’s bipartisan budget
deal when it comes to our troops. It is
harming military readiness and harm-
ing military training.
The CR has also delayed new weapons
programs, and it has suspended exist-
ing weapons programs. These include
hypersonic strike weapons, missile de-
fense systems, and new fighters and
ships.
Our adversaries—most notably Iran,
China, and Russia—pose a grave, grow-
ing threat to our Nation. That hasn’t
stopped House and Senate Democrats
from blocking both the Defense author-
ization and funding bills. Right now
they are blocking both.
The National Defense Authorization
Act, which is the authorizing bill, has
passed and been signed every year since
1961. That is when John Kennedy was
President of the United States—1961.
The NDAA has a long history of
strong bipartisan support. Yet, right
now, House Democrats are delaying
final passage of our National Defense
Authorization Act. Again, they are
blocking the House’s spending bill for
our military, even though it gives our
troops a well-earned pay raise.
Like the Presiding Officer, I fre-
quently visit our troops overseas. I did
so last month. We have a number of
Wyoming National Guard members de-
ployed around the world, and it is al-
ways an honor to spend time with
them.
Most recently, I visited Wyoming
troops deployed in the Middle East and
in Kosovo. The Wyoming guard is
about 400 members overseas. It is our
State’s largest deployment in a decade.
As I noted at this year’s American Le-
gion Post 6 Veterans Day celebration
in Cheyenne, WY, these troops will be
away from home for Thanksgiving;
they will be away from home for
Christmas; and they will be away from
home for New Year’s as well.
Both my dad and my father-in-law
served overseas. My dad fought in Eu-
rope in World War II in the pivotal Bat-
tle of the Bulge, the 75th anniversary
of which is coming up next month. My
father-in-law fought in both theaters
during World War II and also served in
the Korean war.
The U.S. Armed Forces are on the
frontlines. They are defending our free-
doms, and they are doing it every sin-
gle day. They make this sacrifice 365
days a year, and they do it to protect
us, to protect our freedom, and to pro-
tect our Nation. U.S. servicemembers
never quit. They don’t complain, and
we don’t quit on them when they need
us the most.
Our troops deserve our full support
right now, and, clearly, that support
must be bipartisan. Yet Democrats re-
main too obsessed to do the work of
the Nation. People elected them to do
a job, and those people are nowhere to
be found.
Think about it. Democrats are fast-
tracking impeachment and filibus-
tering the defense funding bill. How
can they do that in good conscience?
Instead of funding certainty, we have
an impeachment circus.
Republicans are committed to work
on policy priorities for the people who
elected us. It is time for Democrats to
stop the stonewalling. Let’s give our
troops the state-of-the-art tools they
need and the raise they deserve and
have earned.
Democrats need to get their prior-
ities in order. Defense should be top of
the list. It is past time to keep our
promises to the military. It is past
time to give the troops a well-earned
and well-deserved pay raise, and it is
past time to fund the defense of our
Nation and to fund our government.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.

ator from Iowa.
PENSIONS
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the
financial crisis facing the private sec-
tor multiemployer pension system
calls for comprehensive reform and
getting it done soon.
The crisis is severe and growing
worse every day. Would you believe
about 125 multiemployer plans are in
so-called critical and declining finan-
cial status? These plans report that
they will become insolvent over the
next two decades. There will be a lot of
people without a retirement plan if we
don’t act.
Several large plans, including the
United Mine Workers Pension Fund
and the large Central States Pension
Fund, predict these plans will become
insolvent in the next few years. That is
not a very comfortable environment
for those retirees.
This will leave more than 1.3 million
participants without the pension bene-
fits they have been promised and, of
course, worked for probably through-
out their whole lives.
In just my State of Iowa, the benefits
of close to 10,000 participants of multi-
employer plans are at risk if the sys-
tem fails. Ten thousand Iowans being
affected by what we do or don’t do, ob-
viously, gets my attention. That figure
of 10,000 will represent over $70 million
in benefits paid out annually that
these individuals rely on in retirement.
More broadly, another large group of
multiemployer plans are in critical
status. They report that no realistic
combination of contribution increases
or allowable benefit reductions—op-
tions available under the current law

to address their financial condition—
will enable these plans to emerge from
their current, poorly funded financial
condition. So it is very important that
Congress act to save these retirement
plans. These plans cover millions more
workers and retirees across the Nation,
and those workers and retirees face sig-
nificant benefit cuts under existing
law.
We should also be concerned about
the financial health of the Federal in-
surance system that backs up these re-
tirement benefits. The Federal insur-
ance system goes by the name of the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
The PBGC’s multiemployer pension
program may itself become insolvent if
only one or possibly two larger multi-
employer plans fail.
One of these plans, the United Mine
Workers, just lost its last large con-
tributing employer to bankruptcy.
Without reforms, the Federal guaranty
system, the PBGC, reports it will be in-
solvent no later than 2026. When that
happens, the PBGC will not be able to
pay either current or future retirees
more than a very small fraction of the
benefits they have been promised.
Consequently, substantial reductions
in retirement income are a very real
possibility for the millions of workers
and retirees who depend on benefits
from these plans. We need to act very
soon to protect the hard-earned pen-
sion benefits of the workers who par-
ticipate in these plans.
As chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, I am on the floor today to
join with Chairman ALEXANDER from
the Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee to release a respon-
sible reform plan to address the imme-
diate financial challenges of a number
of plans in critical financial condition
and also at the same time to secure the
multiemployer pension system over
the long term, not just a quick fix that
is going to last a short period of time.
As we looked at options for reform-
ing the current system, we relied on
several important reform principles. I
will go through these principles.
First, a reform plan should provide
balanced assistance to the most poorly
funded plans.
The second principle is that Federal
assistance to the failing plans should
rely on as little taxpayer dollars as
possible.
The third principle is that reforms
must promote long-term stability of
the multiemployer pension system and
the long-term solvency of the PBGC.
To help the sickest plans recover
their financial footing, our proposal
creates a special partition option for
multiemployer plans.
I want everybody to know that this is
not a new concept. In fact, quite sim-
ply, it expands on the PBGC’s existing
authority. It is based on banking in-
dustry reforms that Congress enacted
after the Great Depression and at other
times.
The partition option permits employ-
ers to maintain a financially healthy
multiemployer plan by carving out
pension benefit liabilities owed to par-
ticipants who have been ‘‘orphaned’’ by
employers who have exited the plan
without paying their full share of those
liabilities. By removing these liabil-
ities, we allow the original plan to con-
tinue to provide benefits in a self-sus-
taining manner by funding benefits
with contributions from current par-
ticipating employers. In effect, parti-
tioning creates a healthy pension that
continues to meet all of its obligations
to retirees and a separate ‘‘sick pen-
sion’’ that requires attention and as-
sistance from the PBGC.
For this partition program to operate
effectively and address the plans that
are in immediate danger, a limited
amount of Federal taxpayer funds will
be needed to support the PBGC. We ex-
pect the necessary Federal resources to
comprise only a small—I should say
very small—portion of the financial as-
sistance provided to the faltering mul-
tiemployer plans, and it is our intent,
as we should be fiscally responsible, to
offset those costs.
We should also acknowledge the re-
ality that action right now means
lower taxpayer involvement than if we
wait for the PBGC to become insolvent,
which would lead to a far larger com-
mitment of taxpayer funds in the not
too distant future. Congress needs to
be ahead of the real catastrophe we
know is coming.
Over the long run, the reforms we are
proposing will be sustained primarily
by shared-sacrifice funding reforms and
a new premium structure for all stake-
holders of the multiemployer plans.
Because taxpayer dollars would be at
risk if the sickest plans fail to move to
fully funded status, the proposal also
includes a number of plan-governance
reforms to strengthen multiemployer
plans, to protect the taxpayers’ con-
tributions to the overall reforms, and
to shield taxpayers from future risks.
While partitioning addresses one ele-
ment needed for reform, Senator ALEX-
ANDER and I propose to go a step fur-
ther to make significant changes to the
management and operation of all mul-
tiemployer pension plans. This is some-
thing that should have been done years
ago so that plan trustees would have
had to act in a responsible way, and
maybe we wouldn’t be where we are
today, but we want to make sure this
doesn’t happen in the future. If we go
that way—and we must go that way—
moving forward, the entire multiem-
ployer pension system will be better
funded and more transparent to par-
ticipants, to sponsoring employers, and
to government regulators.
Providing relief to critical and de-
clining plans is contingent on making
changes to the legal framework of the
multiemployer pension system to en-
sure that all plans operate, as people
would expect, in a financially sound
way in the future.
To help finance the partition relief
and to provide a stronger PBGC insur-
ance guarantee to participants in the
system, our reform proposal creates a
new premium structure. That structure
includes raising the flat-rate premium
to $80 per participant in a multiem-
ployer plan, putting the multiemployer
program on par with a single-employer
guarantee program. The new premium
structure also broadens the base on
which premiums are assessed to more
equitably spread the cost of insuring
benefits and to ensure PBGC solvency.
The new structure applies a copayment
to active workers and retirees. How-
ever, because of the broader contribu-
tion base, the copayments are signifi-
cantly less than the amount of the typ-
ical benefit cuts retirees face under
current law if their plan should fail.
Older retirees and disabled participants
will also be protected.
In addition, our reform package es-
tablishes a variable-rate premium.
This variable-rate premium, which par-
allels the variable-rate premium that
has long applied to single-employer
plans, is tied to a plan’s funding status
to manage risks stemming from more
poorly funded plans. This also creates
an incentive for plans to improve their
funding over time.
The new premium structure not only
helps to secure the finances of the
PBGC but also funds an increase in the
guaranteed benefit level for the vast
majority of participants in the system.
Raising the guaranteed benefit will
greatly reduce the risk to retirees of
significant reductions in retirement in-
come, which would otherwise occur if
their multiemployer plan becomes in-
solvent.
While the changes to the premium
structure will fundamentally strength-
en the financial status of the multiem-
ployer pension system and the PBGC,
the reforms we are proposing make
other important structural changes to
the multiemployer system to help en-
sure that the entire system moves to a
well-funded status over the long haul.
We achieve this goal by addressing
key flaws in the current legal frame-
work governing multiemployer plans.
Current multiemployer plan rules do
not serve the best interests of workers
and retirees. You can tell that by the
bad condition, financially, some of
these plans are in today, threatening
the retirement of our workers who
have paid into them over a lifetime.
These rules have not been sufficient to
keep plans in good financial health,
and they tend to underestimate liabil-
ities and result in insufficient con-
tributions to the plans.
To ensure that benefit promises of-
fered in a multiemployer plan are ulti-
mately met, our proposal strengthens
the rules for measuring the value of
promised pension benefits and the
amount of employer contributions nec-
essary to pay them when the worker
retires. These changes will require plan
trustees and actuaries to measure and
project plan assets and liabilities in a
more prudent and accurate way than
has been required under present law.
These changes also are designed to
help move plans toward full funding

and at the same time protect the inter-
ests of plan participants and the tax-
payers who would otherwise be re-
quired to bail out these multiemployer
plans.
Our reform proposal also improves
the so-called zone rules. Plans will be
required to look further into the future
when estimating their financial status,
and will have to institute a form of
stress testing to check whether a plan
can remain financially sustainable
through potential economic and demo-
graphic stresses. Depending on its
health, plans will have to bolster the
steps they take when signs of financial
hardship arise. That is a pretty com-
monsense approach.
We will also replace current with-
drawal-liability rules with a simpler,
more transparent, and consistent
method for determining an employer’s
liability if it withdraws from a multi-
employer pension plan.
We have to look to the future. In
doing so, the proposal includes a new
option for sponsors of multiemployer
plans to establish a new hybrid pension
plan that we are going to call a com-
posite plan. We have heard a great deal
of interest from smaller businesses and
their workers about the benefits of a
composite plan approach, including
less costly operations and more cer-
tainty in the financing of these plans.
In closing, let me say that there are
no perfect solutions to the multiem-
ployer pension crisis. But it is very
true that the longer we wait, the hard-
er and more expensive this problem
gets. But it is clear, our solution is far
better than allowing the system to
continue on its current path—to col-
lapse—and far better than merely
throwing Federal money into plans
without changing how they operate.
The problem is never going to be solved
by waiting or by using taxpayers’
money.
The House has essentially advanced a
pure, no-strings-attached bailout plan
that throws taxpayer money to the
plans in the hope that they can some-
how earn returns sufficient to keep
them going. We rely a great deal on the
Congressional Budget Office around
here for estimates of the future, and
the nonpartisan CBO has told us that
the House’s proposal will not generate
sustainability of pension plans or the
sustainability of the PBGC. So we had
better not spend our time on some-
thing the Congressional Budget Office
says just isn’t going to bring a solution
and definitely not a long-term solution
to these issues.
In contrast, the proposal that Sen-
ator ALEXANDER and I are releasing
today addresses the immediate needs of
the few multiemployer plans facing im-
mediate crisis in a manner that pro-
tects participant benefits and also en-
sures a sustainable multiemployer pen-
sion system for the long haul, and it
does this all in a fiscally responsible
way.
Our proposal is not a giveaway to
corporations or to unions, and it is a
better deal for the taxpayers than a fu-
ture that would be an even larger prob-
lem and PBGC funding needs that will
almost surely be met with a taxpayer
bailout.
All participants in the system would
make a sacrifice. Let me make that
clear. All participants in the system
are going to sacrifice—employers,
unions, workers, and retirees. I am
sure each one of those groups isn’t
going to consider this fair and respon-
sible, but with a problem like this, if
everybody doesn’t give a little bit, it is
never going to be fair and responsible
anyway. But with some shared pain
will come significant shared gain that
will be to the benefit of over 1.5 million
participants in about 125 multiem-
ployer plans that are in serious finan-
cial jeopardy.
Without changes to the current sys-
tem, we can’t say for sure that people
are going to get the benefits that they
sacrificed for over a lifetime of work.
But our plan, we are confident, will
benefit all multiemployer plans and
their participants by providing a
stronger system for the long haul and
by promoting long-term solvency of
the PBGC.
Senator ALEXANDER and I offer this
proposal as a path forward for a multi-
employer pension system that we all
know is in crisis.
Now, as we turn to getting this job
done, I look forward to working with
my colleagues in the Senate and in the
House of Representatives to advance
this proposal. We all know that just be-
cause you lay something on the table,
that it is not necessarily going to be
passed that way. So maybe there is
some compromise needed. But whether
it is this proposal or a little bit of com-
promise, we have to get this piece of
legislation to the President’s desk be-
fore more pension holders face losses of
the benefits they have earned and bene-
fits that they were promised.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 2486
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I
rise this afternoon to talk about what
some observers have called one of the
best historically black colleges and
universities in our country—Delaware
State University in Dover, DE, home of
the Hornets.
For a number of years, I was a naval
flight officer in the Vietnam war and
then came back to the United States
and moved to Delaware and got an
MBA at the University of Delaware.
Right away after that, I went to work
at what became the Delaware Eco-
nomic Office. We were headquartered
at the campus of Delaware State Col-
lege.
Delaware State College was an HBCU
and was not a well-funded college, not
one that was in the favor, frankly, of
the Governor and legislature, for the
most part, and was a bit of a stepchild.
I used to think: Boy, wouldn’t it be
great to be able to help transform
Delaware State College into something
historic, memorable, and outstanding.
Later on, I would be elected Gov-
ernor—about 15 years later—and have
the chance to work with the fellow who
was the president of Delaware State
University at the time and to trans-
form, with the help of the Delaware
General Assembly, Delaware State Col-
lege into Delaware State University.
Today, of all the HBCUs in the coun-
try, I think its latest rating is No. 5,
and I think there are 70 or 75 of them
in all. They just reported that their en-
rollment for the coming year will
reach 5,000 students, all in under-
graduate, graduate, master’s and Ph.D.
programs, which is a record. We are
proud of the Hornets and the great job
they are doing educating people.
Last month, in one of my frequent
visits to Delaware State, I took a cam-
pus tour unlike any other, from the
cockpit of a brand-new Vulcanair V1.0
single-engine aircraft. We flew all over
Kent County, north of Dover. We had a
chance to do some approaches. It was a
lot of fun, and it was basically a re-
minder that Delaware State provides
undergraduate and graduate programs
for all kinds of training and edu-
cational needs. One of the key ones
right now and one of the most inter-
esting, at least for a naval flight offi-
cer, is that Delaware State is the larg-
est producer of pilots and aviation pro-
fessionals of color in the country. I be-
lieve they have over 100 students and
every one of them, when they graduate,
has a job waiting for them. Some are
pilots and others do a variety of work
for aviation.
Today, we have about 157 million
people who go to work in this country,
and we have about 5 million jobs where
nobody will show up. One of those
areas where we need people is in the
aviation world, and Delaware State is
providing that. When the plane landed
earlier this year at the airport just
north of Dover, I held a roundtable
with the Delaware State University ex-
ecutive vice president and provost, Dr.
Tony Allen. We talked with adminis-
trators and students about a bipartisan
bill called the FUTURE Act, which was
discussed on the floor today and in pre-
vious days.
The FUTURE Act, as you will recall,
was introduced by Senator JONES along
with Senator SCOTT from South Caro-
lina, and would provide a little over
$255 million annually to minority-serv-
ing institutions of higher education in-
cluding about $85 million to HBCUs for
an additional 2 years through fiscal
year 2021.
Almost $900,000 of that money will go
directly to Delaware State University.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6699
November 20, 2019
You might ask: What would Delaware
State do with that money? They use
this Federal funding to help support
STEM and teacher education programs
at the undergraduate and graduate lev-
els and to ensure that students at Dela-
ware State have access to the best re-
search tools. Specifically, this funding
is used to help modernize classrooms at
DSU, to improve math instruction, and
to help recruit young men of color to
teach in K-through-12 classrooms so
that all students have mentors they
can look up to.
According to the National Center for
Education Statistics, only 2 percent of
teachers in the American public school
system are African-American men, but
20 percent or more of the students are
African-American males.
Think about that. A lot of these Afri-
can-American males, frankly, haven’t
had some of the best mentors and role
models in their lives growing up, and
we have so few teachers of color that
are minority male. The FUTURE Act
funding, I think, is a good step for Con-
gress to take to bridge that gap. I
think it is a good example of how the
Federal Government supports this crit-
ical mission at Delaware State and at
HBCUs across the country.
Back in early September, the House
of Representatives did its job and voted
to reauthorize this funding through the
bipartisan FUTURE Act. Unfortu-
nately, the Senate has not followed the
lead of the House in this critical fund-
ing for HBCUs which lapsed on Sep-
tember 30.
Before I yield to Senator COONS, I
just wanted to say that my recollec-
tion is—and I might have this wrong,
but I am looking for my staff, who
would be sitting right here in front of
me telling me if I had the right num-
bers—that 2 percent of teachers who
are in public schools in America and I
think in Delaware are men of color.
They are African American. Almost 20
percent, maybe 25 percent, of the stu-
dents in the public school system are
people of color and about half of those
are male. We need to do a better job.
As Governor, I started a mentoring
program. We recruited, when I was
Governor, 10,000 mentors—a lot of them
to work with children of color. A lot of
them have grown up in homes where
they didn’t have a positive male role
model in their life. That is why the
mentoring program is so important.
That is why we especially need minor-
ity male teachers who are African
American. That is not all we need, but
it is a big part of what we need. Over
half of the minority male teachers that
we have in Delaware in our schools
were educated at Delaware State Uni-
versity—over half—and we need more
of them.
Senator COONS has joined me on the
floor. I am enormously proud of Dela-
ware State University and the leader-
ship they have today and in the past,
and proud to have been an honorary
Hornet, and proud to yield to my col-
league, Senator COONS, who has been
right there fighting for Delaware State
University.
I yield the floor.
Mr. COONS. Madam President, I
would like to thank my colleague from
our home State of Delaware. I come to
the floor to join a number of my col-
leagues who are speaking on a pressing
issue, the critical lapse in funding for
hundreds of colleges and universities
across our Nation.
On September 30, $255 million in an-
nual Federal funding for historically
black colleges and universities and mi-
nority-serving institutions expired.
Since this fund was first created, it
has supported 400 HBCUs and MSIs, his-
torically Black colleges and univer-
sities and minority-serving institu-
tions, across our country, including 97
HBCUs last year. This lapse has cre-
ated real uncertainty and harm to
these organizations and these univer-
sities, their students, their employees,
and the public.
I just wanted to join my colleagues
in highlighting the importance of this
funding. I want to speak specifically to
the HBCU of which Delaware is so
proud—Delaware State University.
Delaware State is an engine for edu-
cational equity and access, for innova-
tion and for leadership in our State,
our region, and our Nation.
Delaware State University is one of
the country’s top public HBCUs. Its
graduates go on to successful careers in
all sorts of industries. Graduates from
Delaware State have become some of
our State’s best nurses, teachers, busi-
ness leaders, social workers, and Sen-
ate staff.
DSU’s research programs are impor-
tant drivers for innovation in a State
with a proud history of invention and
innovation. It is home to the Delaware
Center for Neuroscience Research, a
partnership of institutions across our
State working to advance our under-
standing of how our brains form
thoughts and memories and feelings,
and how they change over time as we
age.
It is also home to OSCAR, the Opti-
cal Science Center for Applied Re-
search, where research that is in part
federally funded is helping to speed
early detection of disease, supporting
our soldiers in better deterring and de-
tecting threats, and equipping NASA
missions, including the Mars Rover,
with improved sensors.
To put it simply, we are very proud
of Delaware State, and there is a lot of
which to be proud. DSU grads are so
impressive that I have asked several of
them to join my staff here in Wash-
ington. Their commitment to equity
and excellence is why we can’t allow
HBCUs around the country, such as
Delaware State, to lose out on vitally
needed Federal funding.
Last year, this program provided
nearly $1 million—$887,000—to Dela-
ware State, which is about 20 percent
of their title III funding. These funds
have a direct impact on students and
funds critical science, math, and edu-
cator preparation programs.
There is no good reason for the Sen-
ate to ignore our HBCUs and MSIs and
deny them the funding they deserve. In
September, the House passed a bipar-
tisan, budget-neutral, 2-year extension
of this critical funding, which is known
as the FUTURE Act. While I share Sen-
ator ALEXANDER’s commitment to per-
manently extending this funding, we
must not ask institutions to put their
budgeting and planning on hold while
we here in the Senate negotiate over
many other pressing issues in higher
education.
I urge my colleagues to pass the FU-
TURE Act immediately, and with that,
I would like to make a motion.
Madam President, as in legislative
session, I ask unanimous consent that
the Senate proceed to the immediate
consideration of Calendar No. 212, H.R.
2486. I ask unanimous consent that the
Murray amendment at the desk be
agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be
considered read a third time and
passed; and that the motions to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon
the table with no intervening action or
debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President,
reserving the right to object—and I
will object—I am disappointed that my
colleagues are offering such a short-
term, piecemeal approach toward re-
solving the problems of our historically
Black colleges and minority-serving in-
stitutions, when I have repeatedly of-
fered a much better idea, and they have
blocked it. I will offer it again in just
a moment. I know the Senator from
North Carolina is here to speak on the
same subject.
Compared to what I have offered,
they are offering a short-term, 2-year,
budget gimmick-supported idea that
will have a difficult time passing the
Senate. What I have offered and they
have blocked is permanent funding of
historically Black colleges and minor-
ity-serving institutions—permanent
funding—at the level of $255 million a
year, properly funded. That is No. 1.
There is assurance from the U.S. De-
partment of Education that every sin-
gle historically Black institution—
there are 97 of them—have enough
funding to go until next October. Even
the Senate ought to be able to do its
job in that period of time.
At the same time, I have offered the
Alexander-Jones bill offered by the dis-
tinguished Senator from Alabama,
which would simplify the Federal aid
application form called the FAFSA for
8 million minority students, among 20
million families in this country.
Why would anybody want to take a
short-term, piecemeal approach that is
based on a budget gimmick that
couldn’t pass the Senate compared
with permanent funding for histori-
cally Black colleges and a bipartisan
proposal to change the hated, dreaded
FAFSA by reducing the number of
questions you have to answer from 108
questions to between 18 and 30? This

S6700 November 20, 2019
document is the single biggest impedi-
ment to minority students going to
college in America today, and the
Democrats are blocking the passage of
a bipartisan bill.
I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from North Carolina.
Mr. BURR. Madam President, I want
to thank the chairman of the com-
mittee for objecting. I want to tell my
colleagues on the other side of the aisle
that I appreciate their being here giv-
ing the passionate speeches they have
because they made the case for Senator
ALEXANDER’s bipartisan bill.
You see, incorporated in this legisla-
tion is an initiative by Senator JONES
and Senator BALDWIN. Anybody who
makes this out to be a partisan piece of
legislation is just flat wrong. I have
more historical Black colleges in North
Carolina than any State can claim.
When those chancellors and presidents
have been presented with the question:
Do you want 2 years or permanent,
they all said permanent. They didn’t
know there was a permanent option.
I say this to my three colleagues be-
cause none of them are on the com-
mittee: There is a permanent option
for funding historically Black colleges.
It is in the chairman’s bill. We have
been told that the FUTURE Act needs
to be passed. The FUTURE Act is 2
years long. There is not much of a fu-
ture there. We ought to match its title
with the chairman’s bill because this
really does address the future.
The No. 1 concern of historically
Black institutions is predictability of
funding. The chairman’s bill is perma-
nent. We are not going to come in here
in 2 years and seek another reauthor-
ization, but the benefit is that we are
passing good legislation.
Let me point out to my colleagues
that it is important to read legislation.
The FUTURE Act is funded by whack-
ing the funding for the State guaranty
agencies. By taking away the account
maintenance fees that these State-
based organizations receive to admin-
ister loans, we are robbing Peter to pay
Paul. These same students who are
probably going to go to historically
Black universities are also seeking
State-based loans to do it, and we are
providing the institutions 2 years of
predictability on one side, and we are
taking away the fees that are needed to
administer the loans to allow them to
be able to afford it. This is when it is
important to look at the details.
The way the FUTURE Act is funded,
it actually hurts all institutions in
North Carolina. Just today, I heard
from the North Carolina State Edu-
cation Assistance Authority about how
important this funding is for their
daily functions in administering stu-
dent loans. So I believe there is a bet-
ter way to extend HBC funding but also
not to hurt students.
At the end of the day, our focus—the
human face we see is the student who
benefits from the educational oppor-
tunity they have been given. I would
tell you that the FUTURE Act flunks
on all counts. It is not permanent. It
takes away from some because of how
it is funded. We have an opportunity
with Chairman ALEXANDER’s bill, the
Student Aid Improvement Act, which
would extend this title III funding per-
manently, but it would also include
other bipartisan support changes in
higher education, like expanding Pell
grants. Every Member of the Senate
has sat on this floor and said we have
to do something on Pell grants. Here is
your opportunity.
It doesn’t fit in the timeframe of
passing a bill that passed the House
that provides 2 years of funding, but we
have a bipartisan piece of legislation.
It simplifies the financial student fi-
nancial aid process. You saw the chair-
man hold up the form. There is nobody
who can defend the continuation of
that form. It should be one page. The
chairman of the Education Committee
has tried for now 5 years to transition
that to one page. You might look at us
and say: Well, we can do this very
quickly, but we need time to talk
about this. We have taken 5 years to do
this, and the people on the committee
know this.
This is the sixth time you have come
to the floor and asked unanimous con-
sent to do the exact same thing: Pass
this; don’t look at anything else.
No, that is wrong, but it is not wrong
because we are in the majority. It is
wrong because it is not serving the stu-
dents for whom we are supposed to be
here setting policy. It simplifies aid
award letters to students. It is actually
easy to tell them they got their stu-
dent aid. It is cumbersome. If you are
on the committee, you understand the
agony they go through. We are wiping
all of that away.
I believe Chairman ALEXANDER has a
better path. I also would like to remind
my colleagues that while this funding
should be extended, there has been no
lapse. Let me state that again. It
should be extended, and there has been
no lapse.
Madam President, I ask unanimous
consent to have a letter I received from
Secretary DeVos, stating that the title
III funding in question is available
through September 2021, be printed in
the RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
THE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION,
Washington, DC, October 9, 2019.
DEAR [REDACTED] I write to clarify the sta-
tus of grants under Title III, Part F of the
Higher Education Act of 1965, in light of the
enactment of the Continuing Appropriations
Act, 2020, and Health Extenders Act of 2019
(Pub. L. No. 116–59), signed on September 27,
2019.
Initially, I want to note that the new law
has no effect on funds that we recently
awarded in the Title III, Part F programs.
Funds obligated in fiscal year (FY) 2019 have
already been made available to grantees
under all Part F programs in the Depart-
ment of Education’s (Department) G5 Sys-
tem for the project period beginning on Octo-
ber 1, 2019, and ending on September 30, 2020.
Those funds will remain available to grant-
ees for allowable uses during this period. In
addition, in the Part F programs that award
grants competitively, the Department has
carried over FY 2019 funds into FY 2020 to
support noncompeting continuation awards
and supplements for project periods from Oc-
tober 1, 2020, through September 30, 2021.
The Department’s ability to make addi-
tional formula grants in FY 2020 under Part
F for Historically Black Colleges and Univer-
sities (HBCUs) and Tribally Controlled Col-
leges and Universities, and to conduct new
competitions for FY 2021, depends on the
availability of congressionally appropriated
funds. However, this will have no bearing on
the grant funds that have already been made
available to grantees for the next 12 months.
This Administration is committed to each
and every HBCU and other minority-serving
institutions and the important work they do
in educating historically underrepresented
student populations. If you have any ques-
tions about these programs, please reach out
to your program officer in the Department’s
Office of Postsecondary Education.
Sincerely,
BETSY DEVOS.
Mr. BURR. On that basis alone, there
is not the sense of urgency that some
have come to the floor six times and
suggested. I don’t disagree with any of
my colleagues that this is something
we need to do now, but a 2-year tem-
porary bill that doesn’t accomplish any
of the other reforms when we have had
5 years of bipartisan work—why would
we not take this option? Why would we
not sit down and find a way for Chair-
man ALEXANDER’s bill—which has
many Democratic initiatives in it—to
pass and provide historically Black col-
leges and universities with permanent
funding, provide students with a one-
page form to fill out for student aid,
provide an expedited way for the notifi-
cation when their loans have been ap-
proved? We are there, but for some rea-
son, some want us to do a 2-year tem-
porary fix. It is wrong. I thank the
chairman for objecting.
I yield the floor.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President,
I see the Senator from Ohio. I intend to
offer my alternative to which, I gather,
someone plans to object. I will go
ahead and do that unless he wants to
speak at this point.
Mr. BROWN. Go ahead, Senator
ALEXANDER.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2557
Mr. ALEXANDER. What I will do is
make my offer quickly, and then I will
make my speech following the objec-
tion.
Let me summarize, to begin with,
that what has just happened is I have
objected to a short-term, piecemeal ex-
tension of funding for historically
Black colleges and minority-serving in-
stitutions because it is a bill that, I
think, will have great difficulty pass-
ing the Senate because of the way it is
not properly funded. What I am about
to offer, and which I will speak on after
the objection is made, is permanent
funding for historically Black colleges
at the level of $255 million a year—per-
manent funding—as opposed to short-
term, piecemeal funding as part of a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6701

package of higher education legislation
that has been prepared and cosponsored
by 29 Senators—more Democrats than
Republicans—with the principal other
provision being reducing the questions
in the FAFSA, the Federal aid applica-
tion form, from 108 to between 18 and
30. This is a bill introduced by the Sen-
ator from Alabama, Mr. JONES, and I,
which our Senate committee has been
working on for 5 years. It is the single
most important impediment to keeping
minority students from going to col-
lege in our State—and I think most
States, according to our former Gov-
ernor—and it would help 8 million mi-
nority students who fill out this com-
plicated form every year.
I will speak more to that in just a
minute, but that is what I am about to
ask my friends on the other side to per-
mit me to pass.
Madam President, as in legislative
session, I ask unanimous consent that
the Committee on Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions be discharged
from further consideration of S. 2557—
the bill I just described, the permanent
funding of historically Black colleges
and the simplification of the FAFSA
and other measures—and the Senate
proceed to its immediate consider-
ation. I ask unanimous consent that
the bill be considered read a third time
and passed and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid
upon the table.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Ohio.
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I re-
serve the right to object.
I and my colleagues here—Senator
CARPER, Senator COONS, and prominent
Democrats in the education debate—
have deep concerns about Senator
ALEXANDER’s proposed micropackage.
To be sure, it is a micropackage of
higher education bills. It is not a com-
plete reauthorization.
Our caucus has been clear about what
a comprehensive bill should look like.
It addresses access, affordability, ac-
countability, and campus safety. This
Alexander proposal falls well short.
The Senator from Tennessee says
this package is bipartisan. That is sort
of true but not entirely. He has made a
number of changes to the underlying
bipartisan bills that do not have the
support of lead Democrats on this and,
in some cases, the lead Republicans of
the original bills. For example, this
package includes a limited repeal of
the ban on Pell grants for incarcerated
adults instead of the full repeal of the
ban included in the bipartisan bill. Our
bill adds to Pell grants.
His version of the short-term Pell
Grant Program makes significant
changes to the bipartisan JOBS Act of
2019, a bill of which I am an original co-
sponsor. The JOBS Act excludes for-
profit colleges from eligibility for the
program. We know the Trump adminis-
tration is all about for-profit institu-
tions, with the Secretary of Education
leading the charge. This version allows
for-profit colleges—the sorts of schools
we know mislead and scam students in
too many cases—to sneak their way
into eligibility.
One of the things I admire about the
chairman of the HELP Committee—
and have admired since I met him 20-
some years ago—was his work not just
as Secretary of Education but his work
as president of the University of Ten-
nessee. He knows what for-profit col-
leges do for and to far too many stu-
dents. His legislation removes a num-
ber of the protections meant to ensure
programs eligible for this funding are
actually high-quality ones that edu-
cate students. These are just a couple
of the ways this micropackage is dif-
ferent from the original bipartisan
bills. We know the micropackage can-
not pass the House. Chairman SCOTT
and Speaker PELOSI have been clear
that they want comprehensive reform.
A comprehensive HEA reauthorization
can pass. That is not what this is.
I hope we can come to a bipartisan
agreement, but as we work together,
we can’t hold hostage historically
Black colleges and universities. Most
of them are in the South. Most of them
are in the States of my colleagues who
are from the South. Most of them are
in Republican States with Republican
Senators. As mentioned by Senator
CARPER and Senator COONS, of Dela-
ware, my State, which is similar to
Delaware, has historically Black col-
leges. In Ohio, Wilberforce and Central
State are prominent institutions that
matter so much to our State. For the
nearly 2 years now since the Trump ad-
ministration has been in office, these
schools have been in fiscal limbo.
I know Senator ALEXANDER cares
about these schools, but there is no
evidence that the President of the
United States does. They need their
funding extended now. The mandatory
funding, which is vital to these schools,
ran out on September 30 because the
Senate refused to act and because the
President didn’t seem to care. The
House did its job in passing the FU-
TURE Act. Now HBCUs are facing im-
possible decisions in the face of dwin-
dling funding. The Senate needs to im-
mediately take up and vote on the bill
the House already passed to provide
full, mandatory funding for MSIs and
HBCUs.
We all agree—Senator BURR, Senator
ALEXANDER, the two Senators from
Delaware, and Senator CARDIN, who has
just joined us—that HBCUs have fos-
tered generations of Black leaders.
They are a critical part of our Nation’s
higher ed system. These schools have
rich legacies and proven track records
of educating students of color and
other underrepresented students.
Wilberforce was founded in 1856 in
Wilberforce, OH, as the Nation’s first
private institution of higher ed for
Black students. Central State, which is
in the same town across the road in
Wilberforce, has a rich legacy of edu-
cating students as an 1890 land grant
institution. We have helped it this year
through the Committee on Agriculture,
Nutrition, and Forestry. It is further
tasked with strengthening research,
extension, and teaching in food and ag
science.
We know that without our HBCUs,
millions of Black students would have
been denied the opportunity to pursue
higher ed. HBCUs account for approxi-
mately a quarter of all of Black stu-
dents who earn bachelor’s degrees and
nearly a third of all of the African-
American students who earn STEM
bachelor’s degrees. Our country owes
an enormous debt to these schools that
we don’t seem to be paying back. That
is why it is unconscionable that the
Senate has abandoned these schools
and these students.
I have heard from schools about how
their budgets have been thrown into
chaos. They tell me that academia is
about planning, and many of them al-
ready operate close to the margins.
HBCUs have already received letters
from the Department of Education tell-
ing them that they are not getting fu-
ture funding and that they can’t use
any Federal funding for long-term
projects. It could mean program cuts
and layoffs. It means no long-term con-
struction projects. It means not hiring
permanent faculty and not purchasing
major equipment. Imagine operating a
school like that.
It is shameful that in 2019 we still ig-
nore schools that serve students of
color by treating this as anything
other than a must-pass bill. I know
that very few African Americans voted
for President Trump, and I know he
seems to care for only those people who
voted for him. Yet this is an obliga-
tion. Senator ALEXANDER wants to ful-
fill it, but he is operating in a strait-
jacket with this President.
It is so important that we do this.
The FUTURE Act is budget neutral,
and it is fully paid for. We use the same
offset the administration has used. It is
a bipartisan pay-for, not a gimmick.
I should add that less than 2 years
ago, this Senate and President Trump
had no problem passing a $1 trillion tax
cut for corporations and the wealthy
that wasn’t paid for. We have seen that
under Republican leadership in the
White House. We have seen what has
happened to our budget debt, and we
know corporations have had huge tax
cuts. We know 70 percent of the tax
cuts went to the wealthiest 1 percent.
Yet this body can’t take care of his-
torically Black colleges. They hold
schools that serve students of color to
a different standard.
I am hopeful that Senator ALEX-
ANDER, whom I trust, and Senator MUR-
RAY, whom I trust, will continue to ne-
gotiate a truly bipartisan and truly
comprehensive higher ed reauthoriza-
tion that supports HBCUs. I support
those efforts. That is the way forward
for the priorities that Senator ALEX-
ANDER has outlined in his micropack-
age and for the updates and reauthor-
izations all of our students and fami-
lies need. HBCUs and MSIs can’t wait

until that process is over. They need
action now. They have all had to over-
come enough hurdles every day in
order to educate their students. The
U.S. Senate should not be one of those
hurdles. We need to pass the FUTURE
Act now.
Accordingly, I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President,
I see the Senator from Maryland, but I
would like to take a few minutes to de-
scribe the proposal to which Senator
BROWN just objected.
I appreciate the Senator from Ohio in
his saying that he hopes that Senator
MURRAY and I can do what we usually
do, which is to take issues within our
Education Committee and work them
out and present them to the Senate as
a whole, but that is not the way this
came up. This came up suddenly, and
no one talked to me about it. Here we
are when, for 5 years, we have been in
the midst of reauthorizing higher edu-
cation. Permanently funding histori-
cally Black colleges has always been an
important part of that discussion when
suddenly here comes this bill as if
there were an emergency.
What I heard my friend from Ohio
say is that he objects to my proposal as
a microproposal, as a small proposal,
but he is suggesting an even smaller
proposal. He is suggesting a 2-year fix
that, in my opinion, can’t pass the Sen-
ate because of the way it is funded.
Plus, why would you want a 2-year
fix when you have the chairman of the
Education Committee working for the
permanent funding of historically
Black colleges and minority-serving in-
stitutions? This is what I have offered
on the floor, and that is what has just
now been objected to by the Demo-
crats.
At the same time, he mentioned a
number of bills that he thought needed
some changes. The request I made that
was objected to also included simpli-
fying FAFSA, which is the Federal aid
application form that 20 million stu-
dents fill out every year. Let’s put a
human face on that.
The President of Southwest Ten-
nessee Community College in Memphis,
which is a largely minority institution
in terms of its students—I see my col-
league from Tennessee is presiding
today, and she knows this institution
well—told me they lose 1,500 students
every semester because of the com-
plexity of this form. There are 108 ques-
tions. A bipartisan working group, in-
cluding Senator BENNET, of Colorado, a
Democrat; Senator JONES, of Alabama,
a Democrat; Senator KING, of Maine,
an Independent; and many others on
our side, we have reduced these 108
questions to between 18 and 30. It has
the support of the student aid adminis-
trators from across the country. It has
the support of college presidents who
see their students turned away because
their parents and their grandparents
see this as too complex.
Former Governor of Tennessee Bill
Haslam led our legislature to create 2
free years of college tuition in Ten-
nessee, but first you have to fill this
out. Governor Haslam has told me the
single biggest impediment to low-in-
come Tennesseans getting those 2
years of free education is the com-
plexity of that form.
Why would the Senator object to
doing it when we have been working on
it for 5 years and have a bipartisan bill
to get it done? Why don’t we pass it?
Why don’t we make it the law? What
do we say to those 1,500 students who
don’t get to go to college because of
this?
At the same time, at the other end of
our State, the president of East Ten-
nessee State University tells me that
70 percent of his student body is sub-
jected to verification. The way this
system works is you have to give some
information to the IRS and some infor-
mation to the Department of Edu-
cation, and if you make one little mis-
take, they jerk your Pell grant while
they figure out what the problem is.
Seventy percent of the students were
subjected to that verification, and
some of them lost their scholarships
while that happened. That is totally
unnecessary.
People in Tennessee ask me: If that
is true, why don’t you pass it?
That is the question I am asking my
friends because I just asked the Senate
to pass it, and the Senator objected.
Why don’t we pass it? Why don’t we
make it the law? It is not as if I just
showed up one day with this. We have
been all the way through our process of
hearings. It has been through working
groups of Democratic and Republican
Senators. It ought to be done.
There is no need for us to come to
the floor and say we need to pass a
short-term, 2-year fix for historically
Black colleges when, at the same time,
you could have permanent funding for
historically Black colleges and could
fix the Federal aid application form
that 8 million minority students fill
out every year—8 million students.
What are the Senators going to say to
them about why they are not going to
make it easier for them to go to col-
lege when we are here, arguing about a
short-term, piecemeal fix for histori-
cally Black colleges?
In a way, I am glad we are having
this discussion because I have been try-
ing to bring this to the attention of my
colleagues and if you go home and talk
to the families, they will tell you that
20 million fill this out every year. In
Tennessee, it is 400,000. And college aid
administrators will tell you that.
I will give another example. I was in
West Tennessee a couple of weeks ago
at an event that was sponsored by the
Ayers family. For 20 years, they have
given money to help rural kids succeed
in college. What the Ayers have discov-
ered is that instead of spending their
money on scholarships, they are spend-
ing it on counselors because counselors
help students more than the money
does. They have found there are lots of
scholarships, but it is the counselors
who make the difference. Yet what do
the counselors spend their time doing?
They help students answer these un-
necessary questions.
So we are blocking and impeding the
very students the Senator is claiming
he wants to help when he objects to
this bill I offered today.
I want to make it clear that I will
come to the floor every day, if I need
to, and offer legislation for the perma-
nent funding of historically Black col-
leges and minority-serving institu-
tions, which will be fully paid for, and
a bipartisan proposal to simplify the
FAFSA from 108 questions to 18 to 30
questions, which is estimated by the
Congressional Budget Office to allow
for 250,000 new American students to
receive Pell grants as a result of the
simplicity of what we have done.
I am disappointed that we haven’t
come to a bipartisan result on that. My
friends who are here today know very
well that this is the way I like to work.
I believe it is hard to get to the U.S.
Senate, that it is hard to stay here, and
that while you are here, you might as
well try to accomplish something. That
is what I want to do. I hope we can do
it on higher education.
When we accomplish it, I hope we can
say we have agreed on the permanent
funding for historically Black colleges
and that we have elevated the impor-
tance of this complicated FAFSA to
the attention of Senators on both sides
of the aisle so that we say: Let’s get
this done. I don’t want to go home any
longer and have people ask me: Why
don’t you pass that? Why do I have to
give the same information to two dif-
ferent parts of the Federal Govern-
ment? Why are you discouraging the
very low-income students who ought to
be going to college?
I am disappointed in this result
today, and I intend to continue to work
for the permanent funding of histori-
cally Black colleges.
My last sentence will be this: I want
all of the presidents of the 97 institu-
tions to know that the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education has said there is full
Federal funding for historically Black
colleges and minority-serving institu-
tions for another year. Another year
ought to be plenty of time for us to re-
ject this short-term fix and to adopt a
permanent solution as well as to sim-
plify the FAFSA, have short-term Pell
grants, and take up a variety of other
proposals that ought to be a part of the
Higher Education Act.
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING SERGEI MAGNITSKY
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, No-
vember 16 was the 10th anniversary of
the tragic death of Sergei Magnitsky.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6703
November 20, 2019
Sergei Magnitsky was a Moscow-
based lawyer who represented an in-
vestment company, known as Hermit-
age Capital, whose American-born
founder was Bill Browder. In the course
of Mr. Magnitsky’s representation of
his client, he discovered a major tax
fraud issue—$230 million of taxpayer
moneys being funneled through shell
companies with business ties to Presi-
dent Putin. Mr. Magnitsky did what
any good lawyer would do in discov-
ering corruption and reported it to the
local authorities. As a result, he was
arrested and tortured. Ultimately, he
died in prison. He was in prison for
nearly a year without having a trial.
Unfortunately, this is not a unique
circumstance in Russia, but we in the
global community decided that we
could not let this injustice go without
taking action. Those responsible need-
ed to be held accountable. Yet, in Rus-
sia, those responsible for this tragedy
were promoted and received awards.
So there needs to be accountability
for those who violate basic human
rights and their government will not
take action.
I first learned of the Magnitsky trag-
edy in my role as a member of the Hel-
sinki Commission. I was the chair and
ranking Democrat on the Helsinki
Commission. The Helsinki Commission
is the way we enforced the Helsinki
Final Act that was passed in 1975, and
it adheres to basic principles of human
rights. It gives every member-signator
of the Helsinki Final Accords the right
to challenge what is happening in other
states. Russia is a signator to the Hel-
sinki Final Act. The United States is a
signator, and we raised the Magnitsky
issue.
Then, working with the late Senator
John McCain, I authored legislation
known as the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of
Law Accountability Act. It was en-
acted into law in 2012, and what it does
is it says that those who were partici-
pating in gross human rights violations
in Russia—related to what happened to
Sergei Magnitsky—that those who
were responsible would not be allowed
to visit the United States by being
granted visas or to use our banking
system. Why was that so important?
Because these corrupt officials like to
have their assets in dollars, not rubles,
and they like to visit the United
States, and they like their families to
visit the United States.
What is unique about the Magnitsky
Rule of Law Accountability Act is that
Congress can initiate the executive
branch taking up particular names.
It is interesting—I have heard from
many Russians who fully support what
we are doing. We are giving them an
opportunity for their voices to be
heard.
Mr. Putin lobbied against its passage,
but it passed Congress by an over-
whelming vote. To date, 54 individuals
have been sanctioned under the Sergei
Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability
Act of 2012, and it has been very effec-
tive. We have been told through press
accounts that in the summit meeting
between Mr. Putin and President
Trump, it was one of the first subjects
that Mr. Putin raised in regard to the
Magnitsky sanctions. And I must tell
you, it provided U.S. leadership a way
to stand up and hold human rights
abusers and corrupt individuals ac-
countable for their crimes. As a result
of our action, other countries acted—
Canada acted; European countries
acted—and we were able to get much
more effective use of this sanction
against human rights violators.
The Magnitsky legacy is not limited
to Russia. Unfortunately, there are
powerful, corrupt, and dangerous
human rights violators globally, where
countries do not hold these violators
accountable for their actions. So once
again partnering with the late Senator
John McCain, I authored the Global
Magnitsky Human Rights Account-
ability Act, which was enacted in 2016,
and we have used that act. We used it
in Saudi Arabia to deal with the tragic
death of Jamal Khashoggi. Over 100 in-
dividuals have been sanctioned under
Global Magnitsky, including those in
the DRC, Nicaragua, and Burma as re-
sult a result of the Rohingya tragedies.
Once again, U.S. leadership was there.
As a result of our action, we saw action
in Canada, and we saw action in the
European Union.
As we commemorate the 10th anni-
versary of Sergei Magnitsky’s tragic
death, let us recognize that Sergei’s
life and legacy have led to two of the
most significant human rights ac-
countability laws that exist today. Be-
cause of Sergei Magnitsky, the United
States and many of our allies now have
the tools available to hold human
rights abusers accountable and to deter
would-be perpetrators from commit-
ting such crimes in the first place.
I urge my colleagues to continue to
honor Sergei Magnitsky through our
actions. Let us stand by our values and
continue to ensure the protection and
defense of human rights around the
world.
I yield the floor.

GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I
know people are waiting to see what
might happen around here. We will
have before us a continuing resolution
to fully fund the Federal Government
through December 20. I wish this was
not necessary, and that we would have
just passed all of our appropriations
bills. But while I wish the step was not
necessary, I would urge all Members to
vote aye.
I wish we were further along in our
work, but it is not for lack of trying. It
is no secret what is holding up negotia-
tions—the President’s demand for $8.6
billion more for his vanity wall along
the southern border. This is a wall the
President gave his word to the Amer-
ican people that Mexico would pay for
it, and now he is telling the American
people: No, I want the American tax-
payers to pay for it.
I should point out that he already
has $10 billion on hand. He could not
possibly build that much of his wall,
anyway, over the next fiscal year with
the eminent domain that would have to
be done in Texas and elsewhere. And, of
course, the wall they have built, at a
cost of millions of taxpayer dollars a
mile, can be defeated by a $100 saw at
the local hardware store. The President
was talking about how they will make
it so high that it will be hard to get
over it, but you can just kneel down
and cut a hole to go through it. But he
has $10 billion on hand for his wall. It
could not be spent in the next year no
matter how much the government is
overcharged for the wall.
He stole $6.3 billion of that from our
troops and their families, and despite
the fact that the vast majority of that
money has yet to be spent, he wants
more.
If we hadn’t had this issue, we would
have had our work done by now. To
quote one of the most famous baseball
players, ‘‘It’s deja vu all over again.’’
The President is once again putting his
own personal interests ahead of the in-
terests of our country.
I would like to remind the Chamber
what is at stake in the annual appro-
priations bills. These are the things
that are being held up because the
President wants us to forget his prom-
ise that Mexico would pay for this wall.
What is being held up? Well, edu-
cation for our children. Cutting-edge
medical research. Anybody who has a
family member with cancer or diabetes
or any other disease wants their tax
dollars being spent on medical re-
search. Support for our Nation’s farm-
ers, medical care for our veterans, ad-
dressing the opioid crisis, environ-
mental programs to keep our air safe
to breathe and our water safe to
drink—all of these things are being
held up, all are being put on autopilot
because the President cares about his
wall—his symbolic wall—far more than
he does about medical research or med-
ical care for our veterans.
So we find ourselves at a critical
juncture. We could pass another con-
tinuing resolution to allow us to con-
tinue to negotiate in good faith, which
I am committed to do, or shut down
the government. Well, that is really
not a choice.
The continuing resolution before us
is a good bill that will allow us to con-
tinue our bipartisan, bicameral negoti-
ating on the fiscal year 2020 appropria-
tions process. I hope all Senators will
support it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6704 November 20, 2019
I would note for Senators how the
Republican chairman of the Appropria-
tions Committee, Senator SHELBY, and
I, as vice chairman, have kept the proc-
ess in a bipartisan fashion. Almost all
of our appropriations bills have come
out of committee unanimously or vir-
tually unanimously. They have come
to the floor, and then they have gotten
an overwhelming vote. Let’s rely on
those Senators in both parties who are
willing to set aside political posturing
and who are willing to set aside sym-
bolism and instead have substance.
In addition to continuing to fund our
government for 4 more weeks, our bill
tackles some issues that have to be ad-
dressed right away. It provides the
Commerce Department with the nec-
essary funds to carry out the decennial
census, which is required by our Con-
stitution. It provides funds for mobile
centers to ensure that the census
reaches those in the hardest to reach
areas. It fulfills our constitutional ob-
ligation to make sure every American
is counted.
The bill includes a provision that
would block a looming $7.6 billion re-
scission of highway funding set to hit
the States July 1—the States of vir-
tually everybody in this Chamber, Re-
publican and Democratic alike. With-
out this provision, each of our States
would see significant cuts to its high-
way funding. That is the last thing we
need given the dire state of infrastruc-
ture in America today.
The bill includes a pay raise for the
military, which is set to go into effect
in January. It also includes legislation
to ensure that victims of state-spon-
sored terrorism get the compensation
they are entitled to. More importantly,
it ensures that the government re-
mains funded and open while we con-
tinue to work on full-year appropria-
tions bills.
Now, even if we passed this bill today
or tomorrow, we have only 4 short
weeks to complete our work. It can be
done. I am committed to staying here,
as we have in the past. We all worked
nights, weekends, and I must say the
tremendous Appropriations Committee
staff worked even more hours.
But it cannot be a one-sided negotia-
tion. And we cannot be expected to di-
vert billions more in taxpayer dollars
to fulfill President Trump’s cynical
campaign promise as part of the final
deal. It does not have the support in
this Chamber or among the American
people to carry the day.
If we had an up-or-down vote in this
body—will you take this money away
from housing for our troops, for med-
ical research, and all these other
things, to pay for an ineffective wall so
the President will not be embarrassed
by not keeping his word that Mexico
was going to pay for it? Of course, that
would fail. Of course, that would fail.
Nobody wants to go back home and say
they did that.
We have billions of dollars in here to
keep our borders secure. We want to
keep our borders secure. Everybody
wants to, Republican and Democrats
alike, but let’s not waste the money on
symbolism, especially if it means we do
not do our medical research or take
care of housing for our troops among
all the other things I have listed. Do
not do a bill with the hopes of, some-
day, Mexico will pay us back, just be-
cause the President promised they
would. We all know they are not going
to.
So, with that being said, we have
made some progress. I do not go and
call press conferences like some of my
colleague do each moment along the
way, but I have been working closely
with a bipartisan group. We all look
forward to continue to work with
Chairman SHELBY and Chairwoman
LOWEY and with Ranking Member
GRANGER to get these bills across the
finish line.
We owe it to the American people,
and we have demonstrated—I think
Senator SHELBY as chair, myself as
vice chair, we have demonstrated that
we can get the bills through with an
overwhelming bipartisan vote. Just let
us do it. Let’s go forward and pass
them. Let’s do substance over sym-
bolism.
With that, Mr. President, I see my
distinguished colleague on the floor, so
I will yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRAMER). The Senator from Tennessee.
INTERNET EXCHANGE ACT
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, it
is so interesting to be here on the floor
and to hear such a variety of ideas and
to know that, across the country, peo-
ple are logging on and they are tuning
in and they are watching how we go
about our business. And one of the
things that is so interesting as we pull
the Internet and online activity into
our lives and stay connected, we some-
times enjoy the idea of just
‘‘unplugging’’ for a weekend, going to
somewhere in the country that holds a
really special appeal. Certainly at this
time of year, people will talk about
going away for Thanksgiving, or maybe
they went away during the fall to look
at pretty leaves.
They see it as an escape and maybe
even an opportunity to get just a little
bit of smugness in their tone when
they talk about how they have chosen
a destination that has politely in-
formed them to not expect WiFi and
not to expect that Internet connection.
But here is a question for you: How
many would make that trip, but still
knowing there is not that connection,
they take the smartphone, the iPad, or
the laptop anyway? Of course, we know
we all do that.
After all, we have been trained to re-
spond to the buzzing, beeping, and the
ringing of our device, and so eventu-
ally, what happens is we give up and we
start wandering around, searching for a
signal, and then declaring to all of the
very unimpressed locals: Well, I don’t
see how y’all do it without being able
to have access to high-speed Internet.
How can you survive without
broadband?
Well, to my colleagues, let me say
this: They do it because they do not
have a choice. You know, these days,
encountering so much as a spotty cell
signal causes concern for those of us
who are accustomed to high-speed
Internet and broadband connectivity,
but I will tell you there are millions of
Americans out there for whom a
broadband connection or even the pop
and hiss of a dialup connection is com-
pletely out of reach.
In a world where even simple online
interactions require lightning fast con-
nections, economies in rural America
are falling behind. We read every day
about entire industries setting up shop
in budding metropolises like Nashville,
TN, but to many, corporate America’s
glowing new hubs sound like remote
outposts compared to the familiar
crush that is here on the eastern sea-
board.
Our perspective is skewed. Even so,
businesses move inward because they
see potential for growth with minimal
risk, but there is only so far that they
can push it. Rural communities do not
have much to offer in terms of oper-
ational support or a reliable customer
base, and most of them lack a crucial
resource: the funding and infrastruc-
ture to back reliable broadband serv-
ices.
It is true, ‘‘the cloud’’ needs a phys-
ical connection to Planet Earth, and
broadband networks rely on physical
‘‘Internet Exchange’’ points. Without
these hubs, subscribers of different
Internet providers cannot commu-
nicate with one another.
While many businesses are certainly
capable of fronting the costs associated
with building the actual exchange
points and running connections to
other hubs, there is no incentive for
them to gamble on a stagnant econ-
omy, so they go elsewhere, and local
businesses go nowhere, unable to ex-
pand into the global online market-
place.
And just to think, a decade ago, we
wasted an opportunity to bridge the
digital divide, to even close the digital
divide. Back in 2009, during the stim-
ulus days, President Obama signed an
economic recovery package that in-
cluded 7.2 billion, $7.2 billion to expand
broadband services in underserved
areas.
Well, predictably, those dollars began
to flow into urban and suburban areas,
leaving rural communities stranded on
the far side of a gulf that Washington
had ended up widening. Mistakes were
made, but it would be an even bigger
mistake to make rural residents suffer
through it.
This year, I introduced the bipartisan
Internet Exchange Act in an effort to
get the Senate talking about
broadband accessibility. When passed,
the bill will offset the start-up cost of
establishing broadband connections via
a series of grants reserved exclusively
for unserved rural areas. That is
unserved rural areas, those that have
been left out, those that did not benefit

from the $7.2 billion that President
Obama put in the stimulus for
broadband expansion.
They did not get any of that money.
They got left further behind and
pushed further out of the economic
mainstream for the 21st century. As
with any program, infrastructure alone
is no guarantee of success, but the
presence of new and expanded Internet
exchange facilities will create a strong-
er and more competitive web. More
hubs will enable faster data trans-
missions, allowing local businesses to
expand and, in rural communities, e-
commerce to flourish
Farmers, manufacturers, miners, will
gain access to state-of-the-art tech-
nologies that support safer and more
productive operations. Medical practi-
tioners will be able to care for ne-
glected populations via telemedicine.
Schools and libraries will have ad-
vanced tools at their fingertips and
open the world to their students. The
local law enforcement will add an im-
portant tool in their ‘‘public safety
toolbox.’’ Businesses looking to lay
down roots will notice that rural com-
munities are investing in themselves
and, hopefully, make the decision to
bring jobs and business opportunities
to local workers and to rural America.
But perhaps, most importantly, rural
residents and their guests will be able
to decide for themselves whether they
want to connect or unplug, and they
will be able to do it on their own
terms.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 455
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I
come to the floor today to raise aware-
ness about the open enrollment period
for health insurance marketplace cov-
erage.
Between now and December 15, Gran-
ite Staters and Americans across the
country can enroll in healthcare plans
for 2020 through the Affordable Care
Act’s health insurance marketplaces.
Tens of thousands of Granite Staters
and millions of Americans will be eligi-
ble for Federal premium tax credits to
help pay the cost of monthly premiums
as well as financial assistance to re-
duce the cost of annual deductibles. I
am sad to say the Trump administra-
tion refuses to be a reliable partner in
helping to spread the word about open
enrollment.
For the third year in a row, we have
an administration that has focused on
sabotaging the Affordable Care Act in-
stead of raising awareness for open en-
rollment. This administration is even
focusing resources on promoting en-
rollment and junk health plans that
don’t provide coverage for preexisting
conditions and that don’t meet the Af-
fordable Care Act’s comprehensive cov-
erage requirements.
After failing to repeal the Affordable
Care Act in the Senate, the Trump ad-
ministration is making an end-run
around Congress, trying to dismantle
the ACA through regulations, adminis-
trative actions, and lawsuits in the
Federal court.
As we can see in this chart, 2 years
ago, the administration cut funding for
advertising and outreach efforts to pro-
mote open enrollment by 90 percent.
The administration went from $100 mil-
lion—we can see on that bar—down to
$10 million in 2017 and $10 million in
2018 and $10 million in 2019.
These advertising cuts are pennywise
and pound foolish. They are part of the
administration’s concerted attempt to
keep Americans in the dark about what
their insurance options are.
Federal advertising on television and
through digital platforms and other
media is critical to drawing a healthy
and balanced mix of consumers into
the marketplace. In fact, research
shows that California’s State-level in-
vestments in marketing and adver-
tising for open enrollment generated a
3-to-1 return on investment through
lower premiums from a more balanced
risk pool.
By refusing to adequately promote
open enrollment, the administration is
forcing our insurance markets to miss
out on an opportunity to improve the
markets, to lower premiums for con-
sumers, and to ensure a healthy health
insurance market—no pun intended—
throughout this country.
That is why I introduced the MORE
Health Education Act—to restore those
health insurance marketplace adver-
tising dollars and to increase outreach
funding back to the $100 million a year.
My bill would also prohibit the admin-
istration from using any of these funds
to promote short-term plans or junk
plans—plans that don’t comply with
the Affordable Care Act’s requirements
for preexisting condition protections
among many other provisions that pro-
vide real insurance coverage for people
who need it.
The Congressional Budget Office
projects that approximately 500,000
more people would enroll in the health
insurance marketplace or Medicaid
coverage each year as a result of my
legislation. That is half a million peo-
ple who would be insured and be able to
better take care of themselves and
their families, and they would have ac-
cess to primary care, to preventive
services, and to a wide variety of other
services they need and that they would
be afforded under the essential health
benefits of the Affordable Care Act.
My bill would also result in a reduc-
tion in marketplace premiums thanks
to the increased enrollment from a
more balanced risk pool. It would be a
win-win all around.
Mr. President, at this time, as in leg-
islative session, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the HELP Committee be dis-
charged from further consideration of
S. 455 and the Senate proceed to its im-
mediate consideration. I ask unani-
mous consent that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Indiana.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 913
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, reserving
the right to object, ObamaCare has
failed because it is the classic example
of Big Government getting in cahoots
with a healthcare industry that is bro-
ken. It was doomed to fail because
when has Big Government and Big
Business ever resulted in something
that is going to cost less and be more
effective?
Under ObamaCare, decisions are
made by the healthcare industry execu-
tives and the Federal Government bu-
reaucrats—not patients, not con-
sumers. This program is authorizing
millions of dollars we don’t have to
prop up a system that is not working.
If ObamaCare was working, it would
sell itself, but it doesn’t work. Costs
continue to rise, and Americans con-
tinue to be stuck with the bill.
I believe there are things that
ObamaCare does that we should keep. I
actually incorporated it into my own
business’s plan back before the law re-
quired you to do it. I covered pre-
existing conditions and no cap on cov-
erage. The pillars of ObamaCare—we
should all accept that.
When they added keeping kids on
there until they are 26, that is fine too.
Those ships have sailed. But the Af-
fordable Care Act is not remotely af-
fordable, and it is only going to get
worse.
I applaud the Trump administration
for doing their due diligence on how
healthcare policy changes are going to
affect average Americans. They are
taking the approach to not go deeper in
the hole with something like
ObamaCare but to reform the industry
by making it competitive, transparent,
eliminate the barriers to entry and,
yes, encourage the healthcare con-
sumer to get involved in his or her own
well-being.
I do believe President Trump is right.
The Republicans can be the party of
healthcare without involving more
government, but we need to do that by
putting more power back into the
hands of the American people, not
ceding total power to government bu-
reaucrats and big healthcare execu-
tives.
I have a better idea. The truth in
pricing act—my bill I am countering
with—encapsulates some of the ideas
behind the proposed and final rules an-
nounced by the White House last week,
which I fully support. The complex,
opaque nature of healthcare pricing
makes it difficult for consumers to an-
ticipate, measure, and compare
healthcare costs and coverage options.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6706 November 20, 2019
Hospitals have a chargemaster that no-
body can understand, which actually
inflates retail prices billable to a pa-
tient or an insurance provider, but in-
surers usually negotiate steep dis-
counts to these inflated prices that
consumers and the employers who pay
all the bills never see. It is done behind
closed doors.
More pricing transparency would ad-
dress this market failure. Increased
competition gives more decision mak-
ing to the people who are supposed to
use it.
This is why I introduced the truth in
pricing act, which requires health in-
surers to disclose negotiated rates, in-
cluding any cost-sharing obligations
for consumers for healthcare services
covered under their health plans. It is
difficult for insured consumers to shop
for healthcare services in our current,
opaque, and broken market within
which ObamaCare works, especially if
they don’t know actual prices. Insurers
have the unique ability to provide this
information to consumers.
Why subsidize insurance companies
to pay for navigators and insurance
agents when we can instead make the
market work better and be more con-
sumer-driven and transparent? This is
the way we break the stranglehold that
government in big healthcare has on
healthcare delivery.
I ask unanimous consent that the
Senator modify her request and in-
stead, as in legislative session, the
Committee on HELP be discharged
from further consideration of S. 913,
the True Price Act, and the Senate pro-
ceed to its immediate consideration. I
ask unanimous consent that the bill be
considered read a third time and passed
and that the motion to reconsider be
considered made and laid upon the
table.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the
Senator so modify her request?
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Reserving the right
to object, let me say that I agree with
my colleague that we need more trans-
parency in healthcare pricing. I would
argue that one of the places we most
need that transparency is when it
comes to the price of prescription
drugs.
As I am sure my colleague knows,
the cost of prescription drugs is prob-
ably the biggest cost driver right now
in increases in healthcare. Yet we in
Congress and the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid are stymied because they
can’t negotiate with the big drug com-
panies to lower the prices of prescrip-
tion drugs and to make that more
transparent to consumers.
The Veterans’ Administration can
negotiate for the cost of prescription
drugs. If you talk to any veteran about
the cost of their prescription drugs and
compare them to what people are pay-
ing in the marketplace, there is a huge
difference because they have that abil-
ity to negotiate.
I am sure that at some point we
could probably find some agreement on
transparency that would make sense. I
think what my colleague is proposing
is not something that has had a chance
to go through the HELP Committee
and, therefore, would need a further
look. I would want to know what hos-
pitals in New Hampshire, the doctors,
consumers, and the insurance depart-
ment in my State would have to say
about that. Until I find that out, I
would have to object to what my col-
league is proposing, but I hope we
could work together to address the
challenges that my constituents—and I
am sure his constituents—are facing
because of the cost of healthcare.
He talked about the failure of the Af-
fordable Care Act. Actually, in New
Hampshire, we have over 90,000 people
who have now gotten coverage for
health insurance because of the Afford-
able Care Act. Through the expansion
of Medicaid, we have reduced the num-
ber of uninsured in New Hampshire to
half the number we had before we
passed the Affordable Care Act.
What my legislation would do is help
people understand what the filing pe-
riod is and how to sign up for the Af-
fordable Care Act and health insur-
ance.
In fact, under the Affordable Care
Act as it exists now, according to esti-
mates from the administration, ap-
proximately 54 percent of Granite
Staters who are shopping for coverage
on healthcare.gov are eligible for a
plan with net monthly premiums of
less than $75, after accounting for tax
credits, and nearly 40 percent of Gran-
ite Staters shopping on healthcare.gov
can find a plan with net monthly pre-
miums under $10.
Now, the cautionary note is that
when constituents of mine or in Indi-
ana or anywhere else in the country
are shopping for plans, they need to
watch out for those short-term, lim-
ited-duration insurance plans—what
are commonly called junk plans—be-
cause they are not required to cover
preexisting conditions. I was pleased to
hear my colleague from Indiana say
that for existing conditions, coverage
is important.
Those junk plans are not required to
provide coverage for essential health
benefits, like maternity care, prescrip-
tion drugs, and mental health services.
If you don’t pay very careful attention
when you go on the healthcare.gov
website, you can be redirected to third-
party insurance broker sites that sell
both junk plans and ACA-compliant
marketplace plans. That creates fur-
ther confusion for customers. What we
heard is that those insurance brokers
are able to charge multiple times the
price for those plans for their fee than
they are for plans under the Affordable
Care Act.
The administration has been allow-
ing these links to redirect consumers
to sites that sell junk plans, even
though the ACA expressly prohibits
any health insurance exchange from
making available any plans that are
not qualified health plans under the Af-
fordable Care Act.
A number of my colleagues and I
have been pressing the administration
to conduct better oversight of brokers
to ensure that healthcare.gov cus-
tomers are not being sold junk plans.
I urge consumers, when they go on
the website, to make sure they stay on
the healthcare.gov website or their
State’s official health insurance ex-
change website when they are shopping
for coverage. Be careful when you click
on links that provide assistance from
third-party insurance brokers.
I encourage Granite Staters and peo-
ple across this country who need
health insurance coverage to take a
look at their options between now and
December 15, during this year’s open
enrollment period. There is still time
to enroll. It is important to tell your
friends and neighbors and your family
members who may not know about
open enrollment because the amount of
money available for outreach has been
reduced so dramatically.
When the administration was trying
to repeal the Affordable Care Act and
this Senate voted, Americans across
the country made their voices heard.
Now we need that same level of engage-
ment to raise awareness of this year’s
open enrollment and overcome this ad-
ministration’s sabotage of the ACA.
Thank you. And if it was not clear
earlier, I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard to the modification.
Is there objection to the original re-
quest?
The Senator from Indiana.
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, reserving
the right to object, we have made
progress here this evening in the sense
that my colleague has brought up an-
other topic—transparency for prescrip-
tions.
Across the board, when it comes to
hospitals and exposing their charge
practices, drug companies becoming
transparent and competing, health in-
surance companies getting rid of the
secret agreements behind the scenes,
and even practitioners, publish your
prices in print or on the web so we as
employers and consumers of healthcare
can try to make the right decisions and
bring costs down.
I do object to the original request.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard.

f
CUBA
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, since the
onset of the Trump Presidency, the
White House has issued a steady
stream of executive orders to reverse
the policy of engagement with Cuba
begun by President Obama. Those deci-
sions have largely curtailed travel by
law-abiding Americans to Cuba who
seek to participate in people-to-people
exchanges, patronize Cuban private
businesses, and otherwise experience
Cuban culture.
Cuba is the only country in the world
to which Americans cannot travel free-
ly, other than North Korea, because
President Trump apparently believes it
is his sole prerogative to tell Ameri-
cans where they can travel and spend
their own money.
I have spoken about the need for en-
gagement with Cuba many times. It is
in our national interest because our
past policy of unilateral sanctions and
isolation—enforced for more than half
a century—failed to achieve any of its
objectives and because engagement
with the people of other countries is
the way we promote our values and
protect our interests.
This is especially true when the for-
eign government is one with which we
have profound disagreements, like Rus-
sia, China, Egypt, Turkey; it is a long
list. But no one is proposing that we
prevent Americans from traveling to
those countries, and if they did, it
would be strongly opposed by Repub-
licans and Democrats alike.
Today, our Embassy in Havana is op-
erating on a shoestring. Whereas there
used to be more than 50 direct hire
staff, today there are fewer than 18.
The Cuban Embassy in Washington has
also been reduced to a shell of what it
used to be. As a result, the ability of
both governments to process visas and
conduct diplomacy is at a virtual
standstill.
Cubans who seek visas to travel to
the U.S. today to participate in edu-
cational programs, cultural, entrepre-
neurial, or scientific exchanges have to
travel to Trinidad, Mexico, or some
other country to apply at our embas-
sies there. The cost to do so far exceeds
what the vast majority of Cubans can
afford, so travel by Cubans to the U.S.
has been reduced to a trickle compared
to what it was before.
The White House has curtailed most
air and sea travel to Cuba, so travel by
Americans has also plummeted. This
has wreaked havoc on fledgling Cuban
private businesses, which depend on
American customers. The administra-
tion seems utterly unconcerned, fo-
cused instead on punishing the Cuban
Government for its support of Nicolas
Maduro in Venezuela. This is nothing
new to the Cuban authorities, and it
empowers hardliners in the Cuban Gov-
ernment who opposed engagement with
the United States in the first place and
who are more comfortable building al-
liances with counterparts in Russia,
China, and North Korea with whom
they share a common ideology and dis-
dain for the United States.
I recognize that the Trump adminis-
tration has no reluctance to hold Cuba
to a standard that it does not hold for
other authoritarian regimes. In fact, if
President Trump were consistent he
would be praising his Cuban counter-
part as a friend or great leader, the
way he praises Kim Jung Un, Xi
Jinping, Abdel Fattah al Sisi, Rodrigo
Duterte, Vladimir Putin, Recep Tayyip
Erdogan, and other autocrats.
But despite this hypocrisy, why don’t
we at least increase the number of con-
sular officers at our embassies so
Americans and Cubans can visit each
other’s countries? I understand that we
have yet to determine the cause of ill-
nesses suffered by U.S. Embassy per-
sonnel in Cuba, for which there is no
evidence implicating the Cuban Gov-
ernment, despite kneejerk claims by
some to the contrary. But the last such
incident was more than a year ago, and
there are certainly U.S. Foreign Serv-
ice Officers who would welcome the op-
portunity to serve in Havana. Both
governments should be working to cre-
ate favorable conditions for restaffing
each other’s consular services so they
can better serve the people of our two
countries.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION
India—MK 45 Gun System
The Government of India has requested to
buy up to thirteen (13) MK 45 5 inch/62 caliber
(MOD 4) naval guns and three thousand five
hundred (3,500) D349 Projectile, 5’’/54 MK 92
MOD 1 Ammunition. Also included are other
ammunition, spare parts, personnel training
and equipment training, publications and
technical data, transportation, U.S. Govern-
ment and contractor technical assistance
and other related logistics support. The total
estimated cost is $1.0210 billion.
This proposed sale will support the foreign
policy and national security of the United
States by improving the security of a stra-
tegic regional partner.
The proposed sale will improve India’s ca-
pability to meet current and future threats
from enemy weapon systems. The MK–45 Gun
System will provide the capability to con-
duct anti-surface warfare and anti-air de-
fense missions while enhancing interoper-
ability with U.S. and other allied forces.
India will use the enhanced capability as a
deterrent to regional threats and to
strengthen its homeland defense.
The proposed sale of this equipment and
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.
The principal contractor will be BAE Sys-
tems Land and Armaments, Minneapolis,
Minnesota with gun manufacturing in Louis-
ville, Kentucky. There are no known offset
agreements proposed in connection with this
potential sale. Any offset agreement re-
quired by India will be defined in negotia-
tions between the purchaser and the con-
tractor(s).
Implementation of this proposed sale will
not require the assignment of additional U.S.
Government and/or contractor representa-
tives to India. However, U.S. Government or
contractor personnel in country visits will
be required on a temporary basis in conjunc-
tion with program technical oversight and
support requirements.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.

States by helping to improve the security of
a major Non-NATO ally that is an important
force for political stability and economic
progress in North Africa.
The proposed sale will improve Morocco’s
capability to meet current and future
threats, and will enhance interoperability
with U.S. forces and other allied forces. Mo-
rocco will use the enhanced capability to
strengthen its homeland defense and provide
close air support to its forces. Morocco will
have no difficulty absorbing the Apache air-
craft into its armed forces.

fication of the AH–64E Apache Helicopter is
CONFIDENTIAL, and the highest classifica-
tion of data and information is SECRET.
a. The AN/ASQ–170 Modernized Target Ac-
quisition and Designation Sight/ AN/AAQ–11
Pilot Night Vision Sensor (MTADS/PNVS)
provides day, night, and limited adverse
weather target information, as well as night
navigation capabilities. The PNVS provides
thermal imaging that permits nap-of-the-
earth flight to, from, and within the battle
area, while TADS provides the co-pilot gun-
ner with search, detection, recognition, and
designation by means of Direct View Optics
(DVO), EI2 television, and Forward Looking
Infrared (FLIR) sighting systems that may
be used singularly or in combinations. Hard-
ware is UNCLASSIFIED. Technical manuals
for authorized maintenance levels are UN-
CLASSIFIED.
b. The AN/APG–78 Fire Control Radar
(FCR) is an active, low-probability of inter-
cept, millimeter-wave radar, combined with
a passive AN/APR–48B Modernized Radar
Frequency Interferometer (M–RFI) mounted
on top of the helicopter mast. The FCR
Ground Targeting Mode detects, locates,
classifies and prioritizes stationary or mov-
ing armored vehicles, tanks and mobile air
defense systems as well as hovering heli-
copters, and fixed wing aircraft in normal
flight. If desired, the radar data can be used
to refer targets to the regular electro-optical
Modernized Target Acquisition and Designa-
tion Sight (MTADS). The content of these
items is classified SECRET. User Data Mod-
ule (UDM) on the RFI processor, contains
the Radio Frequency threat library. The
UDM, which is a hardware assemblage, is
classified CONFIDENTIAL when pro-
grammed.
c. The AN/APR–48B Modernized Radar Fre-
quency Interferometer (M–RFI) is an updated
version of the passive radar detection and di-
rection finding system. It utilizes a detach-
able UDM on the M–RFI processor, which
contains the Radar Frequency (RF) threat li-
brary. The UDM, which is a hardware assem-
blage item is classified CONFIDENTIAL
when programmed. Hardware becomes CLAS-
SIFIED when populated with threat para-
metric data. Releasable technical manuals
are UNCLASSIFIED/Restricted distribution.
d. The AGM–114R is used against heavy and
light armored targets, thin skinned vehicles,
urban structures, bunkers, caves and per-
sonnel. The missile is Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) based, with a variable delay fuse,
improved safety and reliability. The highest

guidance section coupled to an inert missile
bus. The M36E9 CATM does not have a func-
tional rocket motor or warhead, and cannot
be launched. The missile has an operational
semi-active laser seeker that can search for
and lock-on to laser-designated targets. It
functions like a tactical missile (without
launch capability) during captive carry on
the aircraft, making it suitable for training
the aircrew in simulated Hellfire missile tar-
get acquisition and lock. The missile comes
in a reusable aluminum container designed
to protect the missile from shock, vibration,
and other environmental conditions encoun-
tered during shipment, handling, and stor-
age. The highest level for release of the
CATM is SECRET, based upon the software.
The highest level of classified information
that could be disclosed by a proposed sale or
by testing of the end item is SECRET; the
highest level that must be disclosed for pro-
duction, maintenance, or training is CON-
FIDENTIAL. Reverse engineering could re-
veal confidential information. Vulnerability
data, countermeasures, vulnerability/suscep-
tibility analyses, and threat definitions are
classified SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL.
f. The Embedded Global Positioning Sys-
tem/Inertial Navigation System plus Multi
Mode Receiver (EGl+MMR). The aircraft has
two EGIs which use internal accelerometers,
rate gyro measurements, and external sensor
measurements to estimate the aircraft state,
provides aircraft flight and position data to
aircraft systems. The EGI is a velocity-
aided, strap down, ring laser gyro based iner-
tial unit. The EGI unit houses a GPS re-
ceiver. The receiver is capable of operating
in either non-encrypted or encrypted. When
keyed, the GPS receiver will automatically
use anti-spoof/jam capabilities when they are
in use. The EGI will retain the key through
power on/off/on cycles. Because of safeguards
built into the EGI, it is not considered clas-
sified when keyed. Integrated within the EGI
is an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for
processing functions. Each EGI also houses a
Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR). The MMR is in-
corporated to provide for reception of ground
based NAVAID signals for instrument aided
flight. Provides IMC I IFR integration and
certification of improved Embedded Global
Positioning System and Inertial (EGI) unit,
with attached MMR, with specific cockpit
instrumentation allows Apaches to operate
within the worldwide IFR route structure.
Also includes integration of the Common
Army Aviation Map (CAAM), Area Naviga-
tion (RNAV), Digital Aeronautical Flight In-
formation File (DAFIF) and Global Air Traf-
fic Management (GATM) compliance.
g. The AAR–57 Common Missile Warning
System (CMWS) detects energy emitted by
threat missiles in-flight, evaluates potential
false alarm emitters in the environment, de-
clares validity of threat and selects appro-
priate countermeasures. The CMWS consists
of an Electronic Control Unit (ECU), Electro-
Optic Missile Sensors (EOMSs), and Se-
quencer and Improved Countermeasures Dis-
penser (ICMD). The ECU hardware is classi-
fied CONFIDENTIAL; releasable technical
manuals for operation and maintenance are
classified SECRET.
h. The AN/APR–39 Radar Signal Detecting
Set is a system that provides warnings of
radar-directed air defense threats and allows
appropriate countermeasures. This is the
1553 databus compatible configuration. The
hardware is classified CONFIDENTIAL when
programmed with threat data; releasable
technical manuals for operation and mainte-
nance are classified CONFIDENTIAL; releas-
able technical data (technical performance)
is classified SECRET. The system can be pro-
grammed with threat data provided by the
purchasing country.
i. The Stinger RMP Block I Missile, hard-
ware, embedded software object code and op-
erating documentation contain sensitive
technology and are classified CONFIDEN-
TIAL. The highest classification of the
Stinger 92H Reprogrammable Micro-Proc-
essor (RMP) Block I missile hardware is
CONFIDENTIAL, and the highest classifica-
tion of data and information is SECRET. The
guidance section of the missile and tracking
head trainer contain highly sensitive tech-
nology and are classified CONFIDENTIAL.
Missile System hardware components con-
tain sensitive critical technologies. Stinger
Block I critical technology is primarily in
the area of design and production know-how
and not end-items. Information on counter-
measures vulnerability to electronic coun-
termeasures, system performance capabili-
ties and effectiveness, simulation and test
data and software source code are classified
up to SECRET.
2. If a technologically advanced adversary
were to obtain knowledge of the specific
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system
effectiveness or be used in the development
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities.
3. A determination has been made that Mo-
rocco can provide substantially the same de-
gree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification.
4. All defense articles and services listed in
this transmittal are authorized for release
and export to the Government of Morocco.

REMEMBERING GERT BOYLE
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise
today to remember the remarkable life
of my friend Gert Boyle and her many
economic and philanthropic contribu-
tions to Oregon.
Gert died earlier this month at the
age of 95. I am one of the many fans of
Columbia Sportswear—and there are an
awful lot of us in Oregon—who admired
Gert and saw her as synonymous with
the iconic Oregon company she led.
This force of nature came to Oregon
after fleeing Nazi Germany with her
family in 1937. It is an immigrant story
she shared with my parents, who also
fled the Nazis. Like so many other ref-
ugees welcomed to America over the
centuries, Gert arrived to America
ready to work and eager to contribute.
She did both in spades, adding her own
significant chapter to America’s proud
history of immigrant successes.
She was a pioneer, a woman running
a company at a time when that was un-
fortunately even more rare than
women CEOs are today. When Gert’s
husband Neal died unexpectedly in 1970,
she stepped in to replace him as presi-
dent of what was then a tiny local com-
pany weighed down by debt. The chal-
lenge was mighty, but so was Gert. She
became identified everywhere with Co-
lumbia Sportswear as she grew this Or-
egon business into a national and
international brand. It now generates
net annual revenue of $3 billion and
employs more than 6,500 people. Busi-
ness school students and Oregon histo-
rians alike will always remember Gert
for that exceptional run, as will I. And
she gave back along the way, gener-
ously supporting Special Olympics and
the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon
Health and Science University in Port-
land. She was also was a hell of a lot of
fun, as evidenced by her hilarious role
spoofing herself in a 1980s Columbia
Sportswear ad campaign as ‘‘one tough
mother.’’
I close by citing two anecdotes about
Gert among many in the recent obitu-
aries chronicling her amazing life. I
think both capture her toughness and
sense of humor perfectly. One of the
two anecdotes comes from Kerry
Tymchuk, executive director of the Or-
egon Historical Society. He said,
‘‘When she took over, you know, she
was a woman CEO in a business where
there weren’t many women CEOs, in
the sports apparel business. She was
discriminated against and there was
this famous incident where she picked
up her phone and the fellow on the
other end said, ‘I want to speak to the
CEO,’ and she said ‘speaking,’ and he
said, ‘but you’re a woman,’ and she
said, ‘you know, I noticed that when I
got up this morning.’ ’’
The other anecdote comes from Gert
herself. In another obituary, she was
quoted as having said, ‘‘After my hus-
band died, I said, ‘It’s the same
ballgame—it’s just a different coach. I
might not know what I’m doing, but
we’re going to do it my way.’ ’’ Gert
certainly did do it her way. And her
company, its employees, and our entire
State of Oregon are much the better
for it.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO JAY HILDEBRANDT
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise
today to recognize the 40-year career of
a great Idahoan, Jay Hildebrandt, co-
anchor of KIFI Local News 8 in Idaho
Falls, ID. Jay has covered the news
from KIFI since 1984 and has become a
trusted, familiar face to east Idaho
residents. Viewers have come to know
him as a dedicated professional who
gets to the bottom of important sto-
ries, while treating all people with dig-
nity and respect.
Motivated by his conviction to share
positive stories, Jay leaves behind an
inspiring legacy through the uplifting
segments he produced over the past
four decades. In one such weekly seg-
ment titled ‘‘Wednesday’s Child,’’ Jay
introduced children in need of a big
brother or sister figure, a foster home
or an adoptive family. Jay produced
this segment for 28 years, and many
children found permanent homes as a
result. In recognition of his advocacy,
the Congressional Coalition on Adop-
tion Institute honored him and his wife
Sally as ‘‘Angels in Adoption.’’ In addi-
tion to this heartwarming segment,
Jay also highlighted hundreds of high-
achieving local high school seniors
through his ‘‘Distinguished Student’’
weekly report. In 1990, Karole Honas

joined Jay at the anchor desk. Their
contrasting perspectives and reporting
styles created a compelling synergy
that kept viewers watching for over 29
years.
When he isn’t reporting the news,
Jay is an active volunteer in his com-
munity. His service includes participa-
tion on the Governor’s Children’s Trust
Fund Board, Region VII Health and
Welfare Advisory Board, and the Safe
Place Advisory Board. He also serves
his community as an adjunct professor
in the communications department at
Brigham Young University-Idaho,
where he passes along his expertise, re-
porting philosophies and lessons that
can only be learned through experience
to the next generation of journalists.
I would like to commend Jay for over
40 years of bringing the news to Ida-
hoans and congratulate him on his re-
tirement. He will surely stay busy with
his wife Sally, their five grown chil-
dren, and 15 grandchildren. His many
dedicated years on the air have left a
record of a kind and gentle individual,
demonstrating positivity in words and
actions.∑

RECOGNIZING LEISURELAND RV
CENTER
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a mem-
ber and former chairman of the Senate
Committee on Small Business and En-
trepreneurship, each month I recognize
and celebrate the American entrepre-
neurial spirit by highlighting the suc-
cess of a small business in my home
State of Idaho. However, in honor of
Veterans Day on November 11, this
month, I will honor a veteran-owned
small business for each of the 10 days
the Senate is in legislative session. The
personal sacrifices made by America’s
veterans have protected the very free-
doms and values that give each of us
and our children the ability to achieve
the American dream. The skills vet-
erans learn as members of the military
are invaluable and undoubtedly con-
tribute to Idaho’s flourishing veteran
business community. I am proud of the
sacrifices veterans have made to pro-
tect our country and that they are
choosing Idaho to call home when they
complete their service in the military.
As your U.S. Senator from the great
State of Idaho, it is my pleasure to rec-
ognize Leisureland RV Center in Boise
as the veteran-owned Idaho Small
Business of the Day for November 20,
2019.
Leisureland RV Center is owned and
operated by U.S. Air Force veteran
John DeHoff and his wife Carina. John
DeHoff served in the U.S. Air Force for
25 years, and now, he and his wife trav-
el across the United States hand-se-
lecting preowned recreational vehi-
cles—RVs—to restore and resell at
their Boise location. The DeHoffs
opened Leisureland RV Center in 2014
to combine their passions for using rec-
reational vehicles and renovating cars.
The company has a 10,000-square-foot
maintenance facility on-site where ex-
perienced technicians restore high-end
RVs and resell them at market value.
In addition to selling refurbished RVs,
Leisureland RV Center offers basic RV
maintenance services and large-scale
RV repairs. Leisureland RV Center’s
top priority is customer satisfaction.
Employees assess the needs of each
customer to ensure new buyers select
an RV that will fit their lifestyle. This
dedication to exceptional customer
service is one reason many people trav-
el from across the West to purchase an
RV from Leisureland RV Center.
Congratulations to John and Carina
DeHoff and all of the employees at
Leisureland RV Center for being se-
lected as the veteran-owned Idaho
Small Business of the Day for Novem-
ber 20, 2019. You make our great State
proud, and I look forward to your con-
tinued growth and success.∑

TRIBUTE TO GREGORY FERRY
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am
proud to recognize Captain Gregory
Ferry of Hooksett as November’s Gran-
ite Stater of the Month for his leader-
ship m strengthening the partnership
between New Hampshire’s law enforce-
ment and the Special Olympics.
Captain Ferry recently retired from
the New Hampshire State Police after
25 years of dedicated service to the peo-
ple of New Hampshire. Known for going
the extra mile to support his fellow of-
ficers in the line of duty, Captain Ferry
led outside of work as well. Through-
out his career, even while carrying out
the full duties of a New Hampshire
State Trooper, Captain Ferry volun-
teered with the Special Olympics. He
has been involved in everything from
handing out medals to the athletes to
the Law Enforcement Torch Run.
The Law Enforcement Torch Run
helps bring awareness to the Special
Olympics. Captain Ferry would help his
fellow officers run what is called the
‘‘Flame for Hope’’ all across New
Hampshire, for a total distance of 550
miles. Since the run’s inception 35
years ago, New Hampshire law enforce-
ment has raised more than $5.5 million
for Special Olympics, and for 25 of
those 35 years, Captain Ferry was at its
helm.
After 17 years of participating in the
program, Captain Ferry decided to get
even more involved and was chosen as
State police liaison to the Special
Olympics.
In this role, Captain Ferry oversaw
the expansion of law enforcement’s
partnership with the program, which
included recruiting more liaisons, ex-
panding law enforcement’s participa-
tion in the Summer and Winter Games,
and increasing fundraising efforts.
As a symbol of Captain Ferry’s
strong relationship with the program,
he was selected to represent New
Hampshire at the 2019 Special Olympics
World Games in Abu Dhabi, where he
participated in the Torch Run across
the United Arab Emirates. This was a
once in a lifetime opportunity for Cap-
tain Ferry to represent both New
Hampshire law enforcement and the
Special Olympics program on the world
stage.
Captain Ferry has said that the most
rewarding part of his involvement in
the Special Olympics has been the spe-
cial bonds that he has formed with the
athletes, which extend beyond the
playing field. He continues to keep in
touch with some of the athletes on so-
cial media and makes sure to give
them a hug whenever he sees them out-
side of the program.
Captain Ferry’s daughter, Jillian,
also happens to be a Special Olympian.
Her favorite event is bowling, and she
has beaten dad on a few occasions.
From serving as a public safety offi-
cer who went out of his way to support
his fellow officers and protect his com-
munity, to providing a sense of secu-
rity for the athletes in the Special
Olympics program who have learned to
trust him, Captain Ferry has dem-
onstrated what it means to be a dedi-
cated public servant.
Thank you, Captain Ferry, for your
service to our great State, and I wish
you all the best in your future endeav-
ors.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr.
PERDUE, Mr. SCOTT of South
Carolina, and Mr. WARNER):
S. 2913. A bill to apply cooperative
and small employer charity pension
plan rules to certain charitable em-
ployers whose primary exempt purpose
is providing services with respect to
mothers and children; to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor,
and Pensions.
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today I
am introducing the Protecting Critical
Services for Mothers and Babies Act,
with my colleague Senator PERDUE.
Enacting this bill will help ensure that
mothers and infants across the country
continue to receive access to important
health programs.
About 700 women die each year in the
United States from complications dur-
ing or after pregnancy, a problem that
disproportionately affects Black and
American Indian/Alaskan Native
women. In the face of these challenges,
organizations like March of Dimes pro-
vide services that disseminate health
information to pregnant women and
mothers and support care for pre-
mature and ill infants.
Inflexible funding rules and histori-
cally low interest rates have combined
to result in a sharp increase in March
of Dimes’ pension funding obligations
next year. This Act will extend more
flexible rules to organizations that
have a long track record of serving ma-
ternal and infant health needs. These
rules, already offered to other organi-
zations, will continue to protect plan
participants while also smoothing out
pension funding obligations. This
change will ensure that resources are
not diverted away from important ma-
ternal and infant health programs.
By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and
Ms. COLLINS):
S. 2916. A bill to reauthorize the Run-
away and Homeless Youth Act, and for
other purposes; to the Committee on
the Judiciary.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise
to join my colleague, the senior Sen-
ator from Vermont, in introducing the
Runaway and Homeless Youth and
Trafficking Prevention Act. This bill
would update and reauthorize the Run-
away and Homeless Youth Act pro-
grams, which have provided life-saving
services and housing for America’s
homeless youth for more than forty
years.
Homelessness is affecting youth in
unprecedented numbers. According to a
recent study by Voices of Youth Count,
an estimated 4.2 million young people
experience homelessness at some point
each year. Some of these youth may
stay away from home for a few nights,
while others have been living on the
streets for years. Approximately 73 per-
cent experienced homelessness lasting
more than one month. The study also
found that homelessness is just as
prevalent in rural communities as it is
in urban communities.
And sadly, these statistics likely un-
derestimate the scale of this problem.
This month, I met with teachers and
specialists from Lewiston, Maine, who
work directly with young people in
Lewiston High School whose families
experience homelessness. We talked
about the pressures that student home-
lessness places on teachers, school ad-
ministrators, and their already
strapped resources, and, of course, on
the children and teens themselves. Al-
though schools often serve as a first
stop for assistance, the Runaway and
Homeless Youth and Trafficking Pre-
vention Act would reauthorize and
strengthen the programs that help
homeless youth meet their immediate
needs, and it would help secure long-
term residential services for those who
cannot be reunified with their families
safely.
The three Runaway and Homeless
Youth Act programs—the Basic Center
Program, the Street Outreach Pro-
gram, and the Transitional Living Pro-
gram—help community-based organiza-
tions reach these young people when
they need support the most. These pro-
grams help runaway and homeless
youth avoid the juvenile justice sys-
tem, and early intervention can help
them to escape victimization and traf-
ficking.
As Chairman of the Senate Housing
Appropriations Subcommittee, work-
ing to end the scourge of homeless-
ness—among both youth and adults—
has been one of my top priorities.
Along with Senator JACK REED, I cre-
ated a grant program to reduce youth
homelessness. According to the Na-
tional Alliance to End Homelessness,
there has been a 15 percent drop in
chronic homelessness since 2007. We
must build on this success. Homeless
youth should have the same opportuni-
ties to succeed as their peers, and this
bill is an important step in that direc-
tion.
In Maine, our homeless shelters are
critical partners in the fight to end
human trafficking. Earlier this year, I
hosted U.S. Secretary of Housing and
Urban Development Ben Carson in
Lewiston. We visited New Beginnings,
where we saw firsthand how Runaway
and Homeless Youth Act resources are

November 20, 2019
providing essential safety nets for
young people in need. Staff at New Be-
ginnings help young people with case
management, find referrals to local
and State agencies, assist with housing
needs and access to shelter, and con-
nect them to local educational and em-
ployment programs.
These programs produce results. In
2015, I held a hearing during which
Brittany Dixon, a former homeless
youth from Auburn, Maine, testified
about her personal experience with
New Beginnings. After becoming home-
less as a teenager, New Beginnings
gave her the help and support she need-
ed to develop critical life skills and be-
come self-sufficient. She went on to
earn a college degree and obtain a full-
time job as an education technician at
an elementary school.
Mr. President, teens run away and
become homeless for many reasons.
They are also at high risk of victimiza-
tion, abuse, criminal activity, and even
death. The National Center for Missing
and Exploited Children estimates that,
in 2017, one in seven of nearly 25,000
youth reported to them as runaways
were sex trafficking victims. In Maine,
recent reports show that of the more
than 10,000 reported human trafficking
cases last year, 26 percent involved mi-
nors. Several hundreds of these victims
identified as runaway or homeless
youth. This population is at greater
risk of suicide, unintended pregnancy,
and substance abuse. Many are unable
to continue with school and are more
likely to enter our juvenile justice sys-
tem.
Our bill focuses on this tragic prob-
lem by supporting wrap-around serv-
ices for victims of trafficking and sex-
ual exploitation. Congress has passed
legislation in recent years to combat
these horrific crimes and support sur-
vivors, and the policies and tools in-
cluded in the Runaway and Homeless
Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act
are important pieces of the Federal re-
sponse to human trafficking.
The data also show that a growing
number of homeless youth identify as
LGBT. According to the Voices of
Youth Count report, LGBT young peo-
ple are twice as likely to be homeless.
Our bill would ensure that those seek-
ing services through these Federal pro-
grams are not denied assistance based
on their race, color, religion, national
origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender
identity, or disability.
Mr. President, the Runaway and
Homeless Youth and Trafficking Pre-
vention Act will support those young
people who run away, are kicked out,
or are disconnected from families. A
caring and safe place to sleep, eat,

vulnerable youth in our communities.
I thank Senator LEAHY for his leader-
ship on this bill and urge my col-
leagues to support it.
By Mr. DURBIN:
S. 2922. A bill to permit Amtrak to
bring civil actions in Federal district
court to enforce the right set forth in
section 24308(c) of title 49, United
States Code, which gives intercity and
commuter rail passenger transpor-
tation preference over freight transpor-
tation in using a rail line, junction, or
crossing; to the Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the text of the
bill be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the text of
the bill was ordered to be printed in
the RECORD, as follows:
S. 2922
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Rail Pas-
senger Fairness Act’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
(1) Congress created Amtrak under the
Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 (Public
Law 91–158).
(2) Amtrak began serving customers on
May 1, 1971, taking over the operation of
most intercity passenger trains that private,
freight railroads were previously required to
operate. In exchange for assuming these pas-
senger rail operations, Amtrak was given ac-
cess to the national rail network.
(3) In return for relief from the obligation
to provide intercity passenger service, rail-
roads over which Amtrak operated (referred
to in this section as ‘‘host railroads’’) were
expected to give Amtrak passenger trains
preference over freight trains when using the
national rail network.
(4) In 1973, Congress passed the Amtrak Im-
provement Act of 1973 (Public Law 93–146),
which gives intercity and commuter rail pas-
senger transportation preference over freight
transportation in using a rail line, junction,
or crossing. This right, which is now codified
as section 24308(c) of title 49, United States
Code, states, ‘‘Except in an emergency,
intercity and commuter rail passenger trans-
portation provided by or for Amtrak has
preference over freight transportation in
using a rail line, junction, or crossing unless
the Board orders otherwise under this sub-
section. A rail carrier affected by this sub-
section may apply to the Board for relief. If
the Board, after an opportunity for a hearing
under section 553 of title 5, decides that pref-
erence for intercity and commuter rail pas-
senger transportation materially will lessen
the quality of freight transportation pro-
vided to shippers, the Board shall establish
the rights of the carrier and Amtrak on rea-
sonable terms.’’.
(5) Many host railroads have ignored the
law referred to in paragraph (4) by refusing
to give passenger rail the priority to which
it is statutorily entitled and giving freight
transportation the higher priority. As a re-
sult, Amtrak’s on time performance on most
host railroads is poor, has declined between
2014 through 2019, and continues to decline.
(6) According to Amtrak, 6,500,000 cus-
tomers on State-supported and long-distance
trains arrived at their destination late dur-
ing fiscal year 2019. Nearly 70 percent of
these delays were caused by host railroads,
amounting to a total of 3,200,000 minutes.
The largest cause of these delays was freight
train interference, which accounted for more
than 1,000,000 minutes of delay for Amtrak
passengers, or approximately 2 years, be-
cause host railroads chose to give freight
trains priority.
(7) Poor on-time performance wastes tax-
payer dollars. According to a 2019 report by
Amtrak’s Office of Inspector General, a 5
percent improvement of on-time perform-
ance on all Amtrak routes would result in
$12,100,000 in cost savings to Amtrak in the
first year. If on-time performance on long-
distance routes reached 75 percent for a year,
Amtrak would realize an estimated
$41,900,000 in operating cost savings, with a
one-time savings of $336,000,000 due to a re-
duction in equipment replacement needs.
(8) Historical data suggests that on-time
performance on host railroads is driven by
the existence of an effective means to en-
force Amtrak’s preference rights:
(A) Two months after the date of the en-
actment of the Passenger Rail Investment
and Improvement Act of 2008 (division B of
Public Law 110–432), which included provi-
sions for the enforcement of these preference
rights, was enacted, the on-time performance
of long-distance trains improved from 56 per-
cent to 77 percent and Class I freight train
interference delays across all routes declined
by 40 percent.
(B) One year after such date of enactment,
freight train interference delays had de-
clined by 54 percent and the on-time per-
formance of long-distance trains reached 85
percent.
(C) In 2014, after some of the provisions in
the Passenger Rail Investment and Improve-
ment Act of 2008 related to enforcement of
preference were ruled unconstitutional by a
D.C. Circuit Court, long-distance train on-
time performance declined from 72 percent
to 50 percent, and freight train interference
delays increased 59 percent.
(D) The last time long-distance trains
achieved an on-time rate of more than 80
percent in a given month was February 2012.
(9) As a result of violations of Amtrak’s
right to preference, Amtrak has been con-
sistently unable on host railroad networks
to meet its congressionally mandated mis-
sion and goals, which are codified in section
24101 of title 49, United States Code (relating
to providing on-time and trip-time competi-
tive service to its passengers).
(10) Amtrak does not have an effective
mechanism to enforce its statutory pref-
erence right in order to fulfill its mission
and goals. Only the Attorney General can
bring a civil action for equitable relief in a
district court of the United States to enforce
Amtrak’s preference rights.
(11) In Amtrak’s entire history, the only
enforcement action initiated by the Attor-
ney General was against the Southern Pa-
cific Transportation Company in 1979.
(12) Congress supports continued authority
for the Attorney General to initiate an ac-
tion, but Amtrak should also be entitled to
bring a civil action before a Federal district
court to enforce its statutory preference
rights.
SEC. 3. AUTHORIZE AMTRAK TO BRING A CIVIL
ACTION TO ENFORCE IT PREF-
ERENCE RIGHTS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 24308(c) of title
49, United States Code, is amended, by add-
ing at the end the following: ‘‘Notwith-
standing sections 24103(a) and 24308(f), Am-
trak shall have the right to bring an action
for equitable or other relief in the United
States District Court for the District of Co-
lumbia, or in any jurisdiction in which Am-
trak resides or is found, to enforce the pref-
erence rights granted under this sub-
section.’’.
(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENT.—Section
24103(a)(1) of title 49, United States Code, is
amended, in the matter preceding subpara-
graph (A), by striking ‘‘of this subsection’’
and inserting ‘‘and subsection 24308(c)’’.

S6722 November 20, 2019
SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS
SENATE RESOLUTION 435—RE-
AFFIRMING THE IMPORTANCE
OF THE GENERAL SECURITY OF
MILITARY INFORMATION AGREE-
MENT BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC
OF KOREA AND JAPAN, AND FOR
OTHER PURPOSES
Mr. RISCH (for himself, Mr. MENEN-
DEZ, Mr. INHOFE, and Mr. REED) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which
was referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations:
S. RES. 435
Whereas the General Security of Military
Information Agreement (GSOMIA) between
the Republic of Korea and Japan is crucial to
safeguarding United States and allied inter-
ests in Northeast Asia and the broader Indo-
Pacific region;
Whereas bilateral information sharing be-
tween the Governments of the Republic of
Korea and Japan is critical to increasing
trust and growing cooperation that advances
shared defense and security interests;
Whereas the Governments and people of
Japan and the Republic of Korea have made
significant contributions to advancing our
shared defense partnership and promoting
trilateral cooperation;
Whereas defense cooperation among the
United States, Japan, and the Republic of
Korea serves as a deterrent against aggres-
sion from adversaries and external security
threats as well as against new and non-tradi-
tional challenges;
Whereas the suspension of GSOMIA di-
rectly harms United States national security
at a time when the Government of the Demo-
cratic People’s Republic of Korea is engaging
in an increased level of provocations, includ-
ing 12 tests of over 20 ballistic missiles this
year, including new types of nuclear-capable
land and sea-launched ballistic missiles;
Whereas the Governments of the People’s
Republic of China, the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea, and the Russian Federa-
tion are seeking to capitalize on friction be-
tween the Republic of Korea and Japan, and
the resulting strain on trilateral cooperation
and on our bilateral alliances;
Whereas the Government and people of the
United States value the partnership of Japan
and the Republic of Korea in upholding re-
gional security and prosperity, including by
safeguarding maritime security and freedom
of navigation, promoting investment and
commerce, advocating for the rule of law,
and opposing the use of intimidation and
force in the Indo-Pacific; and
Whereas strengthening intelligence shar-
ing is fundamental to the future of trilateral
cooperation, and to enabling the Govern-
ments of the United States, Japan, and the
Republic of Korea to face the challenges
posed by the Government of the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea’s destabilizing ac-
tions, the People’s Republic of China, and
other emerging security threats: Now, there-
fore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) reaffirms the importance of the General
Security of Military Information Agreement
(GSOMIA) between the Republic of Korea
and Japan as a crucial military intelligence-
sharing agreement foundational to Indo-Pa-
cific security and defense, and specifically to
countering nuclear and missile threats from
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea;
(2) underscores the vital role of the alli-
ances between the United States and Japan
and the United States and the Republic of
Korea in promoting peace, stability, and se-
curity in the Indo-Pacific region;
(3) highlights that friction between the Re-
public of Korea and Japan only fractures the
region and empowers its agitators;
(4) urges the Republic of Korea to consider
how to best address potential measures that
may undermine regional security coopera-
tion;
(5) encourages the Governments of Japan
and the Republic of Korea to take steps to
rebuild trust and address the sources of bi-
lateral friction, insulate important defense
and security ties from other bilateral chal-
lenges, and pursue cooperation on shared in-
terests, such as a denuclearized Korean pe-
ninsula, market-based trade and commerce,
and a stable Indo-Pacific region; and
(6) commits to strengthening and deep-
ening diplomatic, economic, security, and
people-to-people ties between and among the
United States, Japan, and the Republic of
Korea.

RECOGNIZING HOWARD
BLACKBURN
HON. VIRGINIA FOXX
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I rise to recognize the late Howard
Blackburn of Hays, North Carolina for his re-
cent induction into the Wilkes County Agricul-
tural Hall of Fame.
Howard Blackburn epitomized a life of ex-
cellence and service. He served in the military
during World War Two and the Korean War.
Howard Blackburn influenced thousands of
lives through his leadership in education and
agriculture. Through his work at Wilkes Com-
munity College, where he served as director of
the life sciences program, Mr. Blackburn
helped thousands of students develop farming
skills.
Howard Blackburn is perhaps best known
throughout Wilkes Country for his contributions
to beekeeping. He helped found the Bee-
keepers of Wilkes, and personally served as
an instructor and mentor for decades. He
helped many, many other people understand
the importance of bees to our lives. He always
maintained the highest standards of meticu-
lous conduct and expected others to strive to
the same level of excellence. Howard Black-
burn is a shining example of service that we
should all seek to emulate.

HONORING THE POLISH HIGH-
LANDERS ALLIANCE OF NORTH
AMERICA ON ITS 90TH ANNIVER-
SARY
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the Polish Highlanders Alliance of
North America as the organization prepares to
celebrate its 90th anniversary. I am proud of
the relationship I’ve developed over many
years with the Polish Highlanders Alliance and
President Jozef Cikowski. It is a privilege to
represent so many Polish Highlanders and I
look forward to gathering with them on Satur-
day, November 23rd for this historic celebra-
tion.
The Polish Highlanders Alliance traces its
roots back to 1929 when its first chapter,
known as a circle, was founded in Chicago.
Since its inception, the Alliance has sought to
organize Polish Highlanders throughout North
America into a unified Highlander family. For
the last 90 years, members of the Alliance
have worked hard to preserve the unique cul-
tural heritage of the Polish Highlands region,
including music, dance, folk costumes, and
other traditions. Through the years, the organi-
zation has grown to over 80 circles throughout
the U.S. and Canada.
Today, the Polish Highlanders Alliance is
headquartered on the Southwest Side of Chi-
cago in the Highlander Home on Archer Ave-
nue. The Alliance organizes many cultural
events for the Highlander and the Polish-
American community including the Highlander
Picnic which attracts nearly 3,000 people
every year. For its numerous cultural activities,
the Alliance has received awards including the
Gloria Artis Cultural Achievement Medal. The
medal was awarded by the Ministry of Culture
and National Heritage of the Republic of Po-
land for the Alliance’s distinguished contribu-
tions to Polish culture. In addition to cultural
activities, the Polish Highlanders Alliance
raises money to provide assistance to church-
es, schools, and other establishments within
Poland and the Highlands region.
This year marks 100 years of diplomatic re-
lations between the U.S. and Poland. I am
overjoyed that as we celebrate this anniver-
sary, the U.S. is finally including Poland in the
Visa Waiver Program. As a result, as of No-
vember 11 citizens of Poland no longer need
a visa to visit the United States. For years I
helped constituents obtain visas for their Pol-
ish relatives to visit the U.S. for baptisms,
weddings, and other family events, and I ad-
vocated alongside the Polish Highlanders Alli-
ance for Poland’s inclusion in the VWP.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in recognizing all that the Polish High-
landers Alliance of North America does to pro-
mote unique Polish cultural traditions and to
support strong ties between Poland and the
United States. The members’ devotion to their
community and their mission is commendable
and I wish them the best as they continue to
impart their traditions for generations to come.
Good wishes (Sto lat).

RECOGNIZING COLLIN COUNTY OR-
GANIZATIONS WORKING TO END
HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS
HON. VAN TAYLOR
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, each year
during the week prior to Thanksgiving, com-
munities across the country come together to
bring awareness to the problems of hunger
and homelessness. Today, I want to recognize
the Collin County organizations working to end
hunger and homelessness throughout our
community.
Today, there are nearly 42 million Ameri-
cans facing hunger and on any given night,
more than 194,000 people will sleep on the
street.
While these numbers are sobering, we are
incredibly grateful to those in our community
who work so hard to ease the suffering of oth-
ers. Organizations such as the Collin County
Homeless Coalition, Family Promise of Collin
County, North Texas Food Bank, Minnie’s
Food Pantry, and Hope’s Door New Beginning
Center, Allen Community Outreach, and many,
many others work year-round to take care of
those less fortunate.
Through these organizations, volunteers,
businesses, and faith communities come to-
gether to provide necessities like shelter and
nutritious meals. They go above and beyond
to ensure those in need have access to basic
medical care and hygiene products and even
provide job training and placement resources
to those struggling with homelessness.
As we approach the holidays, let us not only
remember and support those facing hunger
and homelessness, but also those in our com-
munity who give so much for their fellow man.

HONORING COMMANDER JIM
MOODY
HON. VAN TAYLOR
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today I rise
to recognize the service of Commander Jim
Moody with the Collin County Sheriff’s Depart-
ment. Following a distinguished thirty-seven
year career in law enforcement, a grateful
community thanks Commander Moody for his
leadership and dedication to the citizens of
Collin County.
In 1981, Mr. Moody began his career in law
enforcement with the Atoka County Sheriff’s
office in Oklahoma. During his time in Atoka,
Jim worked in several areas, including Dis-
patch, Patrol, Civil, Mental, and Warrants. In
1985, Jim joined the Collin County Sheriff’s
Office as a Detention Officer. Due to his stellar
efforts, he was promoted to the rank of Cap-
tain over the Detention Facility and as well as
Professional Standards. Later, he would hold
the position of Support Services Captain and
Public Information Officer prior to serving in
his current capacity as a Commander.
I would like to ask my colleagues to join me
today in thanking Commander Jim Moody for
his steadfast service to Collin County and wish
him the best in his future endeavors.

COMMEMORATING THE
RETIREMENT OF LINDA JAY
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Mrs. Linda Jay, a community
leader from Tehachapi, California which I rep-
resent, who is retiring from her position as the
CEO of the Bakersfield Association of Realtors
after an illustrious, decades-spanning career.
As a 30-year veteran of the real estate in-
dustry, she managed the Coldwell Banker in
Tehachapi, served as President of the
Tehachapi Area Association of Realtors, con-
tributed extensively to the Tehachapi News as
a real estate expert, and most recently held
the position of CEO of the Bakersfield Asso-
ciation of Realtors, one of Kern County’s larg-
est trade organizations.
Linda’s community involvement hardly ends
there. In addition to her real estate experience
and leadership, Linda has long been an active
member on numerous local boards and com-
missions, including the Tehachapi City Plan-
ning Commission, Habitat for Humanity Gold-
en Empire, and the Kern Economic Develop-
ment Corporation Board of Directors, to name
a few. Linda’s public service also extended to
local politics, where she served on the
Tehachapi City Council for twelve years and
was elected Mayor of Tehachapi in 2009.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Linda met her hus-
band Bruce through her work as a realtor
when he came to the Bakersfield Association
of Realtors in search of advice for a business
he was starting. Since getting married in 2012,
the Jays have become known as a local
power couple heavily involved in all things
Tehachapi and Kern County. When retired,
Linda and Bruce are looking forward to more
family time with their 6 children and 12 grand-
children, and plan to travel throughout the
country in their RV coach.
On behalf of the 23rd Congressional District
of California, I want to congratulate Linda on
a remarkable career, thank her for her dedi-
cated service to the Tehachapi and Kern
County, and wish her and Bruce all the best
in retirement.

RECOGNIZING THE CRITICAL U.S.-
INDIA RELATIONSHIP
HON. FRANCIS ROONEY
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the critical relationship
with our ally India. I recently had the great
pleasure of sitting down with India’s ambas-
sador to the United States, His Excellency
Harsh Vardhan Shringla to discuss the critical
issues facing India and the importance of the
bilateral relationship between India and the
United States.
India faces many regional and geopolitical
threats. Islamic insurgents are a constant
threat, spreading terror throughout Jammu and
Kashmir and elsewhere in India. We should
support the government in Delhi in the contin-
ued fight against terror. India also faces an in-
creasingly aggressive and assertive China that
continues to export its malign influence
throughout the Indo-Pacific region. China’s be-
havior is destabilizing India’s near-abroad,
saddling its neighbors with unpayable debts,
as was the case with the port project in
Hambantota, Sri Lanka. India is also on con-
stant alert with a hostile and unstable nuclear-
armed state to their West—Pakistan.
India is a critical trading partner with the
United States. India accounts for about 3 per-
cent of the United States’ world trade, which
continues to grow year after year. Likewise,
the United States is India’s second largest
trading partner—accounting 16 percent of In-
dia’s exports. We must continue to work to-
wards strengthening our trade relationship with
India, increasing bilateral foreign direct invest-
ment, and consider the negotiation of a free
trade agreement.
Most importantly, India and the United
States share the same values. As the two
largest democracies in the world, our countries
dually respect freedom and human dignity. It
is then no surprise that the population of In-
dian-Americans grew by 38 percent between
2010 and 2017. Going forward, our relation-
ship with India will only grow in importance. By
sharing the same values, we inherently share
similar interests and concerns. We must con-
tinue working together to confront dangers
abroad, strengthen our economic relationship,
and advance the cause of freedom and de-
mocracy around the world.

the Collin County Reserve unit where he was
employed as a Detention Officer in the Collin
County Detention Facility. After moving to
Anna, Texas in 1988, he would become a full-
time Patrol Deputy.
During his time with the Collin County Sher-
iff’s Office, Mike held a variety of responsibil-
ities, including serving warrants and civil pa-
pers, working as a narcotics officer and super-
visor, and working as a patrol office super-
visor. He continued to serve for 17 years as

JOLLY FOR THE 2019 MONTANA
CONGRESSIONAL VETERAN COM-

HON. GREG GIANFORTE

Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Jodie Penrod Jolly of Dillon
for Montana Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation for her service to her country and
her support of fellow veterans in her commu-
nity.
Ms. Jolly is a veteran of the United States
Air Force where she served as a nurse for
over thirty years. She has received multiple
commendations over her time in the Air Force
including the USAF National Defense Medal
and the Saudi-Kuwait Liberation Medal.
Ms. Jolly had one goal when she came to
Dillon: to support and help veterans in the
community. She started the Beaverhead
Chapter of Joining Community Forces and
hosts an annual dinner to honor veterans, ac-
tive duty personnel, and their family in the
community. Ms. Jolly is known to be a go-to
person in the community for veterans seeking
assistance, connecting them with Veteran
service providers. She is also active with the
VFW Bill Carroll Post 9040, serving as Senior
Vice-Commander.
I ask my colleagues to join me today in
commending Jodie Penrod Jolly for her dedi-

RECOGNIZING DON S. HAVENS
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize Don S. Havens on
his retirement from the office of Mayor of Tip-
ton, Indiana. A well-respected public official for
many decades, Don’s career has been defined
by his faithful service to his fellow citizens.
Don’s record of electoral victories is a testa-
ment to his ability to connect with constituents
and to deliver results. Throughout his 12 years
on the Tipton City Council and 8 years as
Mayor, Don has led the City of Tipton into the
new millennium, helping to bring new ideas to
fruition by directing projects aimed at building
a better community for all of Tipton’s citizens.
Growing up in Tipton, Don graduated from
Tipton High School in 1963, and furthered his
education at Indiana University in Bloom-
ington, Indiana. In 1965, Don became a re-
porter and editor for the Kokomo Morning
Times, a position he would hold until 1967. It
was in 1967 that Don was called into service
for the United States Army and deployed to
Vietnam, where he served until 1968. His mili-
tary service overseas as a Private First Class
garnered Don the Vietnam Service Medal. His
training and experiences in the military also
helped prepare Don for the next four decades
of leadership roles he held in both the public
and private sectors.
After his time in the United States Army,
Don reentered the workforce as a Manager
with Anixter Brothers, a wire manufacturing
company in Tipton. In 1975, Don started Ha-
vens Realty, where he has been at the helm
for over 45 years, continuing to grow the busi-
ness and further strengthen the local econ-
omy. Don became a founding member of the
Tipton Economic Development Corporation, a
group created to help strengthen and develop
the Tipton County business community.
Ever the man on a mission, Don continued
to be heavily involved in the public sphere of
the Tipton community. Spending 12 years on
the Tipton Utility Service Board, Don helped to
lead this municipally-owned group in its effort
to deliver affordable electric power, water and
wastewater collection and treatment to the citi-
zens of Tipton. Throughout his career in public
office Don has been an innovative force help-
ing to move Tipton forward, opening new eco-
nomic opportunities to the citizens of the com-
munity. He spent a total of 20 years in elected
office, never losing an election, including the
post-Watergate election during which Don was
the only Republican to win his local race. His
service record over his 12 years as a member
of the Tipton City Council solidified his sterling
reputation as an outstanding civic leader.
Later in his career Don was elected to two
consecutive 4-year terms as Mayor of Tipton,
first in 2011 and then again in 2015. Taking
office at a time of economic tumult for cities
throughout the country, Don’s experience and
leadership were integral to the continued suc-
cess of the local Tipton economy. While many
municipalities were struggling to attract new
business and limiting civic programs, the city
of Tipton was able to grow the local economy
and embark on bold public initiatives as a re-
sult of the tireless work of Mayor Havens.
Working together with fellow city and state
leaders, Mayor Havens was able to attract
Chrysler FCA to move operations and massive
investment to Tipton.
When Tipton was impacted by extreme
flooding in April 2013, Mayor Havens and fel-
low city leaders worked closely with the Fed-
eral Emergency Management Agency to ac-
quire grants that allowed for homes to be re-
built and renovated for multiple Tipton resi-
dents. Furthering his pride in the city, Don was
integral in the creation of the Tipton Main
Street Association, a volunteer organization
with a mission of helping to build a better Tip-
ton. Recent projects have focused on the
beautification of the downtown area, with land-
scaping and flower planting transforming
downtown Tipton into a vibrant and exciting
center for public gatherings. The Alley project
revamped an empty downtown alley into an
engaging gathering place for the residents and
visitors to come and enjoy the heart of the
city.
Mayor Havens has also overseen efforts to
undertake demolition projects of dilapidated
properties throughout the city, as well as a $3
million investment in parks and recreations in-
frastructure. Over his last 8 years in office,
Mayor Havens and fellow Tipton municipal of-
ficials have led a city initiative to invest $2.5
million into construction projects aimed at fix-
ing and replacing the city’s streets, sidewalks,
and drainage infrastructure, furthering the ef-
forts to improve the city of Tipton and better
serve citizens.
For over four decades, Mayor Don Havens
has consistently served the best interests of
the City of Tipton, as a member of the Utility
Service Board, the City Council and as Mayor.
His career record in government has shown
Don to be an honest, ethical, and trans-
formative public servant who has had an im-
mensely positive impact on the citizens of Tip-
ton. On behalf of all Hoosiers I thank my
friend, Mayor Don Havens for his decades of
exemplary service to the citizens of Tipton and
wish him, his wife and fellow leader in the Tip-
ton community Tami, and his family all the
best in a well-deserved retirement.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks

two constituents from San Juan Capistrano, as
my Constituents of the Month for April.
Each month, I recognize constituents who
have gone above and beyond to help their
neighbors, give back to their community, and
make the country stronger. As co-founders of
a non-profit that provides under-served and at-
risk youth with outdoor recreational activities,
there is no question that Eric and David are
deserving of this recognition.
The brothers’ non-profit, Great Opportuni-
ties, has served over 3000 young people in
my district, mainly coming from San Juan
Capistrano’s geographically identified gang in-
duction zones where kids are most at-risk of
being drawn toward gang activity. Organiza-
tions like theirs play a critical role in gener-
ating opportunity in socioeconomically dis-
advantaged communities, and I am extremely
grateful for the services they provide.
Eric and David provide kids in my district
with more than just recreational activities—
they are providing experiences that will help
kids develop leadership and problem-solving
skills, which will serve them well throughout
their lives. I believe we must do more at the
local, state, and federal to support organiza-
tions like theirs that provide under-served
youth with the skills they need to succeed in
life, and that will continue to be one of my pri-
orities.
I am proud to recognize Eric and David as
my constituents of the month for April, and I
am deeply grateful for everything they do to
give back to our community.

VAN WEZEL 50TH ANNIVERSARY
COMMEMORATION
HON. VERN BUCHANAN
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate the Van Wezel Per-
forming Arts Hall as it prepares to celebrate its
50th Anniversary.
An architectural landmark and a cultural
treasure, the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall
was built on Sarasota Bay in 1968 and 1969
and dedicated to the City of Sarasota on Jan-
uary 5, 1970.
Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright’s son-in-
law, architect William Wesley Peters and in-
spired by a seashell found by Wright’s widow
Olgivanna near the Sea of Japan, the Van
Wezel is the world’s only purple seashell-
shaped theater.
A true pioneer in the cultural development of
Sarasota, the Van Wezel has a history of pre-
senting spectacular Broadway musicals, na-
tional and international performers, popular co-
medians and a compelling mix of classical
productions.
Some of the stars that have visited the the-
atre throughout the years include Lucille Ball,
Ray Charles, Bob Dylan, Van Cliburn,
Liberace, Luciano Pavarotti, Josh Groban,
Carol Burnett, Crosby, Stills & Nash, Hall &
Oates, Tony Bennett, Dolly Parton, Jay Leno,
Steve Martin and Martin Short, Ringo Starr,
Renee Fleming, Vladimir Horowitz, John Leg-
end, Sheryl Crow, Red Skelton, Count Basie
and many more.
The Van Wezel’s powerhouse 2019 through
2020 Broadway season features seven Sara-
sota premieres including Come From Away,
based on the events that took place in New-
foundland on September 11, 2001 and the
days after, as well as the critically-acclaimed
production of Beautiful: The Carole King Musi-
cal, detailing the life and career of the iconic
songwriter. They are also thrilled to present
returning favorites Les Misérables and The
Book of Mormon.
Furthermore, the Van Wezel Performing
Arts Hall is implementing its 2nd National En-
dowment for the Arts Grant to bring arts inte-
gration to schools. This is done through
Schooltime Performances, teacher training,
classroom workshops, and family workshops
that serve over 30,000 students, teachers, and
family members each year.
The Van Wezel has a long tradition of en-
riching the community and supporting arts
education. I appreciate this opportunity to help
commemorate its 50th anniversary.

HON. GREG GIANFORTE
OF MONTANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Thomas Straugh of Dillon
for the Montana Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation for his service and leadership in his
community.
Mr. Straugh served with the U.S. Navy for
30 years and served in Vietnam. Mr. Straugh
received many commendations during his time
in the Navy, including the Vietnam Service
Ribbon and the National Defense Ribbon.
Mr. Straugh is a known leader in his com-
munity. He served on the city council and mul-
tiple committees to improve the community,
such as the site selection committee for the
Veteran Home in Butte. Mr. Straugh is active
in the American Legion, serving as Com-
mander and Vice Commander during his time.
Additionally, Mr. Straugh volunteered his time
driving with DAV van and logged more than
7,500 hours.
I ask my colleagues to join me today in

RECOGNIZING THE GARY CHAM-
BER OF COMMERCE’S 12TH AN-
NUAL LAKESHORE CLASSIC
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with
great admiration that I recognize the Gary
Chamber of Commerce as the organization
celebrates the 12th annual Lakeshore Classic
basketball invitational. In observance of this
special event, the Gary Chamber of Com-
merce will host a celebratory corporate lunch-
eon at the Majestic Star Casino Event Center
in Gary, Indiana, on Tuesday, November 26,
2019, followed by the basketball invitational at
West Side Leadership Academy on Friday,
November 29, 2019, and Saturday, November
30, 2019.
The Lakeshore Classic aims to support the
education and guidance of the youth of our
communities to positive paths, actions, and
endeavors. The Gary Chamber of Commerce
has invited Mr. Kenny Lofton, an East Chicago
native and retired Major League Baseball
(MLB) player, to be the keynote speaker for
the event. Born and raised in East Chicago,
Mr. Lofton graduated from Washington High
School and was an all-state basketball player.
Following high school, Kenny accepted a bas-
ketball scholarship to the University of Ari-
zona, where his unprecedented skills led his
teammates and coaches to believe that he
was able to play any professional sport. Dur-
ing Mr. Lofton’s junior year, he joined the Uni-
versity of Arizona baseball team. Kenny’s
speed and potential were widely recognized
by baseball scouts, and he was soon drafted
in the 17th round of the 1988 MLB draft. Dur-
ing his outstanding major league career, he
played on several different teams and was a
six-time All-Star and four-time Gold Glove
Award winner. Mr. Lofton was also inducted
into the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame and
the Negro League Baseball Museum Hall of
Game. In addition, he is one of only two men
that played in a college basketball Final Four
and an MLB World Series. In 2007, Mr. Lofton
retired from his seventeen-year MLB career,
and for his hard work and determination, he is
to be commended.
Upon retirement, Mr. Lofton created his own
film company, FilmPool, Inc., a full-service
production company with a mission to bring di-
versity to the screen. He is also a board mem-
ber for the Still Got Game Foundation, a not-
for-profit organization for former professional
athletes and philanthropic individuals that pro-
vides charitable resources in promotion of so-
cial change in our local communities and
throughout the world. Recently, Mr. Lofton pre-
sented the Cleveland schools with $15,000
from the foundation and his celebrity poker
tournament. Kenny Lofton’s contributions to
the youth of our communities and his support
for positive social reform will have an unforget-
table impact for generations to come.
At this time, I would like to recognize the
schools participating in the Lakeshore Classic
basketball tournament. These schools are
dedicated to positively impacting Northwest In-
diana through academic excellence and
sportsmanship, and they are successful in
their efforts. The participating schools include
West Side Leadership Academy of Gary, John
Marshall Metropolitan High School of Chicago,
Thea Bowman Leadership Academy of Gary,
East Chicago Central High School, George
Washington High School of Indianapolis, 21st
Century Charter High School of Gary, and
Charles Tindley Accelerated High School of
Indianapolis.
Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask that you
and my other distinguished colleagues join me
in recognizing the Gary Chamber of Com-
merce, the organizers and sponsors of the
12th annual Lakeshore Classic, and the de-
voted volunteers who make this event pos-
sible. Their influence, passion, and dedication
to our youth in Northwest Indiana are truly
commendable.

HON. TRENT KELLY
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to celebrate the life and military
service of Colonel Bobby Towery, Jr., who
passed away on October 26 at the age of 59.
Colonel Towery answered the call to serve
our great nation with the United States Army
in 1983 from the University of Mississippi
Army ROTC. He retired as a Colonel after 30
years of active duty service. Colonel Towery
married his wife, Lisa, in 1984, and together
they lived in 19 different homes before settling
in Oxford, Mississippi, after his retirement.
Colonel Towery set an example of faith for
his family to follow. He was an active member
of St. Peters Episcopal Church in Oxford, Mis-
sissippi, serving as an acolyte, Chair of the
Stewardship Committee, and head of ushers.
Colonel Towery was also an active volunteer
in his community, from sports coaching to
booster clubs. He also had a passion for fit-
ness and enjoyed spending time outdoors with
his family and friends.
Left to cherish his memory is his wife, Lisa
Carver Towery of Southaven, Mississippi; his
two sons, Captain Patrick Towery of Fort Car-
son, Colorado and Nathan Towery; as well as
many friends and extended family members.
Colonel Bobby Towery’s life was one of
service, grace, love for his family, and commu-
nity. He will be greatly missed by all whom he
encountered.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE DAILY GLOBE
IN IRONWOOD, MICHIGAN
HON. JACK BERGMAN
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it’s my
honor to recognize the Daily Globe in
Ironwood, Michigan, upon the occasion of its
100th Anniversary. Through a century of com-
munity investment and growth, the Daily Globe
has become an indispensable part of the
Upper Peninsula.
Seeing the need for a daily newspaper in
the Western Upper Peninsula, Frank E. Noyes
founded the Globe Publishing Company in the
fall of 1919. The Daily Globe’s first edition was
published on November 20th, 1919. Its head-
line covered the tension between President
Woodrow Wilson and the Senate regarding
the proposed League of Nations following
World War I. In 1936, construction began on
its current location, under the leadership of
Frank’s son, Linwood. Over its century of op-
erations, the Daily Globe would grow to be the
local institution it is today.
In addition to their daily publications, the
Daily Globe publishes two annual visitors
guides, sports previews, home improvement
guides, and other specialty pieces. They have
also found success in the 21st century, with a
large online presence and daily updates to its
website and social media. They provide a crit-
ical service to the people of Gogebic and
Ontonagon Counties, and the impact of their
work cannot be overstated. Day after day, the
Daily Globe shows what can be achieved
when a group of people work together for the
betterment of their community. An open house
will be held in honor of their centennial on No-
vember 20th.
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to congratu-
late the Daily Globe in Ironwood for its 100
years of success, community growth, and
service to the people of the Upper Peninsula.
On behalf of my constituents, I wish it all the
best as it ventures into the future.

CONGRATULATING IMMACULATE
HEART OF MARY SCHOOL
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to congratulate an outstanding
school in my district that is being honored for
the second time as a National Blue Ribbon
School. It is a pleasure to congratulate Immac-
ulate Heart of Mary School in Indianapolis, In-
diana, in celebration of this special occasion.
The National Blue Ribbon designation, given
by the United States Department of Education,
is awarded to both public and private schools
across our great nation. Started by President
Reagan and given annually since 1982, the
award celebrates great American schools that
achieve very high learning standards or are
making significant improvements in the aca-
demic achievements of their students. In my
district and across the country, the award rec-
ognizes the great educators, students, and
parents who have worked so hard to ensure
our children reach their full potential and
achieve academic success.
For all of these reasons and many more, I
am very proud that Immaculate Heart of Mary
School is receiving this prestigious designa-
tion. It is a wonderful acknowledgement of the
school’s commitment to providing young Hoo-
siers an exceptional education. While hun-
dreds of schools nationwide were nominated,
only 362 schools were designated as 2019
National Blue Ribbon Schools. Of the 362
schools, Immaculate Heart was one of 12 Indi-
ana schools to receive recognition, making
this recognition all the more impressive. Fur-
thermore, this is the second time the Warriors
of Immaculate Heart have been named a
prestigious Blue Ribbon school, achieving this
designation also in 2005. Under the guidance
of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis and the
leadership of Principal Ronda Swartz, Immac-
ulate Heart has become a beacon of edu-
cational excellence.
Immaculate Heart of Mary School is com-
mitted to providing a nurturing environment for
the intellectual, physical, and social develop-
ment of each child. As a Catholic institution it
has been the mission of the Immaculate Heart
of Mary School to provide an exceptional aca-
demic experience grounded in making God
known, loved and served. This commitment to
the well-being and development of the student
body is led by a dynamic staff of teachers,
working to shape the future through the lives
they are positively influencing in their class-
rooms daily. The dedicated staff at Immacu-
late Heart engages students in meaningful
educational tasks that promote thinking and
reasoning and it is because of their hard work
that Immaculate Heart of Mary School has
been deservedly honored with this Blue Rib-
bon Award.
As an advocate for education and youth, I
want to acknowledge how important it is to our
nation’s future to encourage and raise a new
generation of Americans who have the skills
and knowledge to succeed both in and out of
the classroom. Students like those at Immacu-
late Heart give me hope that we will accom-
plish this vital mission. Their outstanding work
is an inspiration to students, educators, and
parents across the nation. Once again, con-
gratulations to Immaculate Heart of Mary
School. I am very proud of them.

studies teacher at McKinley Technology High
School in the District of Columbia, for being
named the 2019 National History Teacher of
the Year by the Gilder Lehrman Institute of
American History. She was honored on Octo-

Butler is the first teacher in D.C. to be rec-
ognized with this award. As a social studies
teacher, she brings history to life for her stu-
dents and challenges herself to bring them the
untold stories of the past. As the grand-
daughter of a World War II veteran and Baha-
mian immigrant, she recognized the absence
of stories like her family’s in public education.
She works to bring these voices and stories
into the classroom each day.

and storytelling, and frequently uses the Dis-
trict itself as an educational resource. By tak-

The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American
History was founded in 1994 to promote his-

port to those in education and recognize the
efforts of leaders in the field. Each year, the
Institution selects one exemplary American

history in their students as the National History
Teacher of the Year, and awards them
$10,000. We are proud that Butler represents
D.C. with this year’s award.
Butler has also received the 2019 Daugh-

Teacher of United States History Award; a
2019 GrantEd award; and was selected as the

Mr. MEADOWS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Mr. Jerry VeHaun, who will re-
tire after forty-seven years of dedicated serv-
ice with Buncombe County Emergency Serv-
ices.
Mr. VeHaun’s dedication to serving those in
crisis has been evident throughout his life. He

gency Medical Services grow from only em-
ploying first aid trained personnel to an ad-
vanced life support service employing para-
medics and advanced EMTs.
Throughout his career he has led various
emergency management and response organi-
zations. He served as President of the North
Carolina Emergency Management Association
and was awarded the General Edward Foster
Griffin Award twice. He also served as Presi-
dent and Certification Commission Chairman
of the International Association of Emergency
Managers, where he was a recipient of the
Clayton R. Christopher Award. He served as
President of the Western North Carolina Safe-
ty Council. He served as Chairman for the
North Carolina Domestic Preparedness Re-
gion 9 and was a member of the North Caro-
lina State Emergency Response Commission.
Mr. VeHaun also served on the Boards of the
Asheville/Mountain Area Chapter of the Amer-
ican Red Cross; Metropolitan Sewerage Dis-
trict; Aston Park Healthcare Center; MANNA
Food Bank; and the Buncombe County Res-
cue Squad, where he served as Chairman.
Mr. VeHaun’s heart of service is displayed
by his dedication to the people of North Caro-
lina, and also to the nation in times of tragedy.
As a member of a federal Disaster Mortuary
Operations Team, he was deployed to New
York following the September 11th attacks and
to Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina.
It is my great pleasure to celebrate Mr. Jerry
VeHaun before the United States House of
Representatives and thank him for his diligent
service to his community, the great State of
North Carolina, and this country.

CONGRATULATING JAY
HILDEBRANDT
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON
OF IDAHO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to congratulate Jay Hildebrandt on an incred-
ible broadcasting career. Award-winning an-
chor and reporter Jay Hildebrandt, has been a
staple in the community for decades. Jay
began his career in Twin Falls, Idaho at
KMVT–TV where he anchored for two years.
After moving away for a few years, Jay found
his home in Idaho Falls where he has co-an-
chored with Karole Honas for nearly 30 years.
Besides his day to day anchoring and re-
porting, Jay has been involved in a number of
special projects for the newscasts over the
years. For 28 years Jay produced weekly
Wednesday’s Child reports. Each week, a
child living in a temporary foster home, who
needed an adoptive family was featured. Many
viewers were touched by the children’s stories,
and hundreds of them were adopted due to
Wednesday’s Child.
Hundreds of outstanding high school seniors
were also featured by Jay in his weekly Distin-
guished Student series of reports.
Along with his Local News 8 job, Jay keeps
busy a couple mornings a week as an adjunct
instructor at Brigham Young University Idaho
teaching public speaking and broadcast per-
formance classes, which he finds extremely
rewarding.
During his years in Idaho Falls, Jay has
been involved in a number of local community
activities. He has served on the Governor’s
Children’s Trust Fund Board, the Region VII
Health and Welfare Advisory Board, and the
Safe Place Advisory Board.
Madam Speaker, Jay Hildebrandt will be
missed throughout Eastern Idaho, but his ca-
reer has provided an incredible template as to
how the news ought to be reported.

HONORING CHARLES MOIR
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in
honor of Charles Moir, who died on November
15, 2019 at the age of 88. Mr. Moir was a
highly successful basketball coach and mentor
at both Virginia Tech and Roanoke College.
Charles Moir started his career in basketball
by playing in college for three years before be-
coming a high school coach. In his eleven
years coaching high school basketball, he fin-
ished with a career record of 224 wins and 43
losses. His time coaching high school basket-
ball prepared him to become the assistant
coach for Virginia Tech in 1963. Four years
later, Mr. Moir assumed the head coach posi-
tion at Roanoke College.
During Mr. Moir’s time at Roanoke College,
his strong leadership led the team to five con-
ference championships, four NCAA tour-
nament appearances, and even a national
championship in 1972 during his six-year ten-
ure. In his time at Roanoke College, he
amassed an impressive record of 133 wins
and 44 losses.
After Mr. Moir’s time at Roanoke College,
he became the head coach for Virginia Tech
in 1967. His time at Virginia Tech was ripe
with success, evident through his record-
breaking career of 213 wins throughout his 11-
year tenure. Additionally, Mr. Moir led the
Hokies to four NCAA Tournament appear-
ances and four National Invitational Tour-
naments.
Charles Moir was inducted into the Roanoke
College Hall of Fame, the Virginia Tech Sports
Hall of Fame, and the Virginia Sports Hall of
Fame.
Mr. Moir was known as a coach who in-
vested in his players on and off the court. Dell
Curry, a former Virginia Tech and NBA star
told the Roanoke Times, ‘‘He helped me grow
into a man . . . A great father figure, a great
coach.’’
Charles Moir was the type of basketball
coach that brings out the best in student ath-
letes, and his passion for his players and the
game will always be remembered.
He resided in my hometown of Salem dur-
ing his time at Roanoke College and moved
back after leaving Virginia Tech. He was held
in high regard by the Salem community. His
son Page, who played for his father at Virginia
Tech and followed him into coaching, remem-
bered, ‘‘He was a good dad, just like he was

RECOGNIZING GWEN SANDERS AS
CONSTITUENT OF THE MONTH
HON. MIKE LEVIN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it
is my honor to recognize Gwen Sanders, a
North County San Diego resident, as my Con-
stituent of the Month. Gwen has dedicated her
life to giving back to our community and volun-
teering for a wide range of organizations
throughout the region, including the North
County Chapter of the NAACP, the City of
Oceanside, the Communications Workers of
America (CWA), and more.
As a longtime civil rights activist, Gwen re-
ceived the NAACP Woman of the Year Award,
the Oceanside Martin Luther King, Jr. Commu-
nity Service Award, as well as several recogni-
tions for her community service. She has vol-
unteered for the Oceanside Police and Fire
Commission, the Community Relation Com-
mission, and led a program to help local stu-
dents pursue higher education. Gwen’s long
track record of public service goes on, and
there is no question that her dedication to
serving our community has made Oceanside
and all of North County a better place to live.
Gwen personifies John F. Kennedy’s famous
quote: ‘‘Ask not what your country can do for
you—ask what you can do for your country.’’
Gwen’s public service is commendable, and
it’s important to note that she did all of this
work while also raising two children, two
grandchildren, and three great grandchildren.
She is also a two-time breast cancer survivor,
liver transplant recipient, and awaiting a kid-
ney donor. I’m in awe of all that Gwen has ac-
complished in the face of these extraordinary
challenges, and I am deeply grateful for her
service. I am proud to recognize her as my
Constituent of the Month.

CONGRATULATING MOHAWK
TRAILS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
ON BEING NAMED A 2019 NA-
TIONAL BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to congratulate an outstanding
school in my district that is being honored as
a 2019 National Blue Ribbon School. It is a
pleasure to congratulate Mohawk Trails Ele-
mentary School of Carmel, Indiana, in celebra-
tion of this special occasion.
The National Blue Ribbon designation, given
by the United States Department of Education,
is awarded to both public and private schools
across our great nation. Started by President
Reagan and given annually since 1982, the
award celebrates great American schools that
achieve very high learning standards or are
making significant improvements in the aca-
demic achievements of their students. In my
district and across the country, the award rec-
ognizes the great educators, students, and
parents who have worked so hard to ensure
our children reach their full potential and
achieve academic success.
For all of these reasons and many more, I
am very proud that Mohawk Trails Elementary
School is receiving this prestigious designa-
tion. It is a wonderful acknowledgement of the
school’s commitment to providing young Hoo-
siers an exceptional education. While hun-
dreds of schools nationwide were nominated,
only 362 schools were designated as 2019
National Blue Ribbon Schools. Of the 362
schools, Mohawk Trails Elementary School
was one of only 12 Indiana schools to receive
recognition, making this recognition all the
more impressive. Under the guidance of a
dedicated staff and dynamic Principal Jennifer
Greene, the Mohawk Trails Turtles have be-
come a beacon for success in youth edu-
cation.
Mohawk Trails Elementary School is com-
mitted to providing a nurturing environment for
the intellectual, physical, and social develop-
ment of each child. This commitment to the
well-being and development of the student
body is led by a dynamic staff of teachers,
working to shape the future through the lives
they are positively influencing in their class-
rooms daily. The dedicated staff at Mohawk
Trails engages students in meaningful edu-
cational tasks that promote thinking and rea-
soning and it is because of their hard work
that Mohawk Trails Elementary School has
been deservedly honored with this Blue Rib-
bon Award.
As an advocate for education and youth, I
want to acknowledge how important it is to our
nation’s future to encourage and raise a new
generation of Americans who have the skills
and knowledge to succeed both in and out of
the classroom. Students like those at Mohawk
Trails give me hope that we will accomplish
this vital mission. Their outstanding work is an
inspiration to students, educators, and parents
across the nation. Once again, congratulations
to Mohawk Trails Elementary School. I am
very proud of them.

Parker Griffith, and DAVID SCOTT. Finally,
Brian spent time working as a Special Assist-
ant in the Office of the Secretary of Defense
for Legislative Affairs focusing on installations

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I

As the state’s leading news source, the Ga-

TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH SWEAT, JR.
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to pay tribute to Joseph Alton Sweat, Jr., a
journalist, longtime civil rights and good gov-
ernment advocate and a friend, who died Fri-
day at the age of 83.
I knew Joe as a lobbyist for and executive
director of the Tennessee Municipal League,
which he represented when I was in the state
Senate. He was highly respected as a lob-
byist and was always well-informed and he
wrote a regular column on politics and legis-
lation for the municipal league newspaper
that members of the General Assembly al-
ways appreciated. Before that, he had been a
respected reporter for The Associated Press,
covering Elvis Presley’s return to Memphis
in uniform; the plane crash that killed coun-
try music star Patsy Cline in 1963; and the
assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,
in 1968. Joe also created the news bureau at
Vanderbilt University and edited The Van-
derbilt Hustler and later was the first lay
editor of The Catholic Register.
As a representative of the Tennessee Mu-
nicipal League, he twice served on the board
of directors of the National League of Cities.
Later, representing the National Democratic
Institute, he was sent to Bulgaria and Ukraine
as the former Soviet satellites transitioned to
democracies. After retiring in 1998, Joe joined
his good friend Hedy Weinberg in lobbying for
the American Civil Liberties Union of Ten-
nessee and became a board member of both
the Tennessee and national ACLU.
Joe and I shared a love of Memphis State
University and Memphis politics as well as a
devotion to justice. I want to express my sin-
cere condolences to his wife Marilyn; his sons
Joseph, Stephen and Michael and daughter
Cynthia and their extended families; and his
many friends and colleagues. His was a life
well-lived.

REMEMBERING ROBERT
LAVENTURE
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the memory and service of
Robert LaVenture, a committed organizer and
unyielding advocate for workers, who devoted
over 49 years of his life to fighting for the
American worker in the labor movement.
Robert first became involved in labor orga-
nizing after graduating high school when he
began work at an International Harvester
foundry in Waukesha. During his time in
Waukesha, Robert’s stalwart advocacy al-
lowed him to proudly serve as trustee, local
union steward, vice president and of Local
3740. His dedication was recognized by his
peers and led him to be elected president of
the union. As president, Robert helped to cre-
ate the state of Wisconsin’s first employee
education center and later developed other
centers throughout the state when he served
as Wisconsin’s AFL–CIO Coordinator.
Robert embodied the greatest traits of a
union organizer by devoting himself to building
the labor movement and improving the lives of
workers across the country. After serving as
state coordinator for the AFL–CIO, Robert
served as a United Steel Workers International
Staff Representative in the San Francisco Bay
Area and then in Oklahoma. In 2009, recog-
nizing Robert’s tireless and effective work on
behalf of United Steel Workers, he was made
district director of District 12, coordinating
USW work in Alaska, California, Colorado, Ha-
waii, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon,
Utah and Washington. While serving as direc-
tor, Robert used his decades of committed
work to successfully negotiate countless con-
tracts on behalf of steel workers across the
western U.S.
Robert’s legacy is that of a tireless union or-
ganizer, devoting countless hours to fighting
on behalf of American industry and workers in
the U.S. and abroad. Robert’s work will con-
tinue to help the lives of countless people and
his spirit will be missed. Please join me in
celebrating his life and his memory.

Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Major Danisha L.
McClary, a United States Army veteran and
First Lady of Andrews, South Carolina.
Major McClary has served our nation with
honor and distinction. As a Judge Advocate
General, she served as the Chief of Adminis-
trative Law for the 2nd Infantry Division in
Korea, Trial Counsel for the 1st Brigade Com-
bat Team at Fort Hood, Texas, Chief of For-
eign Claims for the Multi-National Division in
Iraq, and as the Chief of Military Justice at
Port Jackson, South Carolina.
Additionally, Major McClary served as the
Program Manager for the U.S. Army Sexual
Assault Prevention Program at Fort Belvoir,
Virginia. She earned high awards and acco-
lades including the Bronze Star, Meritorious
Service Medal, Joint Service Commendation
Medal, and Army Commendation Medal.
Major McClary officially retired from the
Army in the summer of 2016 and immediately
opened her law practice. Since then, she has
served her community as chair of the Andrews
Economic & Community Development Com-
mittee and as a member of the Georgetown
County Accommodations Tax Committee.
Madam Speaker, I join the people of An-
drews in recognizing Major Danisha L.
McClary for being chosen as the Grand Mar-
shal of the 2019 Veterans Day Parade in An-
drews, South Carolina. We honor her and
thank her for her past and continued service

that Mr. Charles Anderson, a relentless fighter
for veterans throughout North County, is my
Constituent of the Month. Mr. Anderson has
dedicated his life to supporting veterans and
their families, serving as Commander of the
Disabled American Veterans (DAV) Tri-Cities
Chapter 95, and belonging to the Oceanside
Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Post 10577
and the Military Order of the Purple Heart
(MOPH) Chapter 493.
As Commander of the local Disabled Amer-
ican Veterans chapter, Mr. Anderson has
made sure that veterans in our community re-
ceive rides to medical appointments and
helped veterans receive the Veterans Affairs
benefits they’ve earned. He’s helped veterans
find gainful employment and financial security,
and he’s worked to ensure that veterans do
not become homeless.
Mr. Anderson’s service with local veterans
groups is commendable, but there are also
several cases where he went above and be-
yond to help a local veteran and their family
in a desperate time of need. When my office
heard that a Marine Gulf War veteran was
struggling to make ends meet due to a serv-
ice-connected terminal illness, it was Mr. An-
derson who immediately made arrangements
to support the veteran’s family financially until
the Veterans Benefits Administration could de-
liver benefits. When I heard from a caregiver
of a Marine veteran who was at risk of becom-
ing homeless, Mr. Anderson stepped up to
cover the veteran’s rent until we could work
out aid from the VA.
On this Veterans Day, we must do more
than pay lip service to our veterans. We need
to fight for the support and resources that vet-
erans have earned and deserve, and that’s
exactly what Mr. Anderson does every single
day. As long as I have the privilege to serve
on the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I
will look to Mr. Anderson as a shining example
of what it means to serve our veterans with
reverence and resolve. I am deeply grateful
for Mr. Anderson’s service to our veterans,
and I am proud to recognize him as my Con-
stituent of the Month.

CONGRATULATING SAINT MARIA
GORETTI SCHOOL ON BEING
NAMED A 2019 NATIONAL BLUE
RIBBON SCHOOL
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker,
l rise today to congratulate an outstanding
school in my district that is being honored as
a 2019 National Blue Ribbon School. I am de-
lighted to congratulate Saint Maria Goretti
School in Westfield, Indiana, for the second
time since I’ve been in Congress, in celebra-
tion of this special occasion.
Started by President Reagan in 1982, the
United States Department of Education
awards the National Blue Ribbon designation
to both public and private schools across our
great nation. The award celebrates great
American schools like Saint Maria Goretti that
achieve very high learning standards or are
making significant improvements in the aca-
demic achievements of their students.
Throughout the country this award is given to
recognize the upper echelon of educational in-
stitutions, that through the dedication and pas-
sion of their amazing educators, students, and
parents have strived to ensure that every stu-
dent reaches their full potential and maximizes
their academic success.
Having previously received this prestigious
award in 2013, the Fighting Angels of Saint
Maria Goretti School have shown just how
deep the commitment to excellence is in-
grained in their staff, faculty, parents and stu-
dent body. This honor is a wonderful acknowl-
edgement of the school’s commitment to pro-
viding its students with an exceptional edu-
cation. While hundreds of schools nationwide
were nominated, only 362 schools were des-
ignated as 2019 National Blue Ribbon
Schools. Of the 362 schools, Saint Maria
Goretti School was one of 12 Indiana schools
to receive recognition, making this achieve-
ment all the more impressive. Under the guid-
ance of the Archdiocese of Lafayette and the
leadership of Principal Vince Barnes, Saint
Maria Goretti School has become a beacon of
educational excellence.
Saint Maria Goretti School is committed to
providing a nurturing environment for the intel-
lectual, physical, and social development of
each child. As a Catholic institution the clergy
and staff work diligently with students to pro-
vide an excellent education, focusing on the
spiritual, academic, emotional, and physical
well-being of each child. This commitment to
the well-being and development of the student
body is led by a dynamic staff of teachers,
working to shape the future by the lives they
are positively influencing in their classrooms
daily. The dedicated staff at Saint Maria
Goretti School engages students in meaningful
educational tasks that promote thinking and
reasoning and it is because of their hard work
that Saint Maria Goretti School has been de-
servedly honored with this Blue Ribbon Award.
As an advocate for education and youth, I
have great respect and admiration for our na-
tion’s educators and their mission to provide
the students of this great nation with the
strong academic foundation critical to future
success. Schools like Saint Maria Goretti
School are an example of how we accomplish
this vital mission. The outstanding educational
techniques developed at Saint Maria Goretti
School should stand as a model for school
districts throughout the nation. The commit-
ment to excellence from the students, parents
and educators at Saint Maria Goretti School
has transformed the school into a beacon of
educational achievement. Once again, con-
gratulations to Saint Maria Goretti School. I
am very proud of them.

VOTE EXPLANATION ON H.R. 3055
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 20, 2019
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, yesterday I
voted against H.R. 3055, a Continuing Resolu-
tion (CR) to fund the government through De-
cember 20, 2019.
Let me be clear: I strongly support the ma-
jority of the funding extensions and protections
in this CR. This includes the well-deserved 3.1
percent pay raise to our men and women in
uniform, of which I also voted in favor earlier
this year in separate legislation. The com-
pensation for our men and women in uniform
should never be compromised by Congress’s
inability to pass annual funding legislation.
I am also pleased that this CR includes a
provision that would protect federal highway
funding and generate new jobs. Using my po-
sition as Chairman of the House Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure Committee, I worked
to ensure that the CR included a provision that
would repeal Section 1438 of the FAST Act of
2015. Section 1438, which was included at the
insistence of Republican leaders in 2015, will
rescind $7.6 billion of federal highway funding
in Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 if it is not repealed.
I strongly support repeal of Section 1438,
which is long overdue. Transportation agen-
cies in all 50 states and the District of Colum-
bia are counting on Congress to prevent this
massive, multi-billion dollar cut from going into
effect. Although I unfortunately had to vote
against the CR for unrelated reasons, I ap-
plaud my colleagues for taking this issue seri-
ously and including the rescission repeal in
this must-pass bill. I’m pleased we are taking
a positive step to finally give states the cer-
tainty they need to carry out long-term projects
that create jobs and help their communities.
Furthermore, I strongly support the exten-
sions in the CR to protect funding for Commu-
nity Health Centers, which provide a vital life-
line for health care services to thousands of
Oregonians and millions of Americans across
the country. I am also pleased that this legisla-
tion extends funding for the National Health
Service Corps and the Teaching Health Cen-
ter Graduate Medical Education Program, two
health care workforce programs that provide
resources to support the training of health pro-
viders in rural and underserved areas.
In addition, I am pleased that this legislation
protects funding for important health care pro-
grams including Medicare and Medicaid pro-
grams, disproportionate share hospitals, the
Community Mental Health Services Dem-
onstration Program, the Special Diabetes Pro-
gram, and funds to respond to the Ebola out-
break in Africa.
I also strongly support the funding exten-
sions provided to ensure the Census Bureau
has the funding it needs to continue carrying
out the 2020 Decennial Census.
Moreover, I support the CR’s funding exten-
sion for the critical Temporary Assistance for
Needy Families (TANF) program, which allows
the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices (HHS) to match state child care expendi-
tures and make scheduled contingency fund
payments. The legislation also ensures that
the current caseload in the Commodity Sup-
plemental Food Program, which serves low-in-
come seniors, is maintained.
However, I opposed the CR because it in-
cludes absurd provisions to extend mass sur-
veillance programs under the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Act (FISA). This includes
Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, which has
allowed for mass surveillance of Americans’
call records, as well as roving wire tap provi-
sions and so-called ‘‘lone wolf’’ authority.
I am strongly opposed to these data collec-
tion and mass surveillance programs, which I
believe are unconstitutional. I voted against
the original PATRIOT Act in 2001, and I have
continued to oppose reauthorization of this
and related mass surveillance programs un-
less and until significant reforms are made to
protect the constitutional privacy rights of U.S.
citizens.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1484 November 20, 2019
For years, I have urged congressional lead-
ership under both parties to take up meaning-
ful reform of these government spying pro-
grams and allow for sincere, robust debate on
how to restore Americans’ constitutional rights
to privacy while also protecting our nation’s
security. In July, I was one of 7 Democrats to
vote against the Intelligence Authorization Act
because it did not contain any significant re-
forms to curb government surveillance.
That’s why I joined my colleagues in send-
ing a bipartisan letter to the House Judiciary
and Intelligence Committees urging them to fi-
nally take up meaningful surveillance reform
legislation before Section 215 and related
FISA provisions expire on December 15 of this
year.
Regrettably, this CR is yet another example
of Congress’s habit of kicking the can down
the road instead of engaging in long-overdue,
substantive debate on surveillance reform leg-
islation. Congress owes it to the American
people to end government mass surveillance
and restore Americans’ civil liberties and con-
stitutional rights.
As I’ve always said, while we must ensure
that law enforcement officials have the tools
they need to assess, detect, and prevent fu-
ture terrorist attacks, I don’t believe we have
to shred the Constitution and Bill of Rights in
order to fight terrorism.
The bottom line is that it is beyond time for
Congress to provide long-term stability and
funding in its annual appropriations process.
The Democratic-led House completed nearly
all of its appropriations bills before September
30, the end of the Fiscal Year. Because the
Senate did not get its work done in time,
bridge funding in the form of continuing resolu-
tions has been needed to keep the govern-
ment open. Congress needs to get its act to-
gether and halt the ridiculous and irrespon-
sible lurching from short-term fix to short-term
fix.
I hope the Senate can get its work done so
we can finally stop the budget gimmicks and
spend our time working on important issues
