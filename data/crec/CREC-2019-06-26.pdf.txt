CONGRATULATING WANDA KAY
BROWN, AMERICAN LIBRARY AS-
SOCIATION PRESIDENT
The SPEAKER. The Chair recognizes
the gentlewoman from North Carolina
(Ms. FOXX) for 5 minutes.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I rise to congratulate Wanda
K. Brown on her inauguration as presi-
dent of the American Library Associa-
tion, the oldest and largest library as-
sociation in the world.
Ms. Brown has an exemplary record
as the director of library services at
Winston-Salem State University’s C.G.
O’Kelly Library in North Carolina’s
Fifth Congressional District. She also
served as associate dean of the Z.
Smith Reynolds Library at Wake For-
est University.
During her tenure as president of the
North Carolina Library Association,
Ms. Brown received many national
awards recognizing her leadership in
numerous library organizations, in-
cluding the Black Caucus of the Amer-
ican Library Association. Ms. Brown’s
presidency of the American Library As-
sociation is the culmination of an ex-
traordinary career in librarianship.
I wish Ms. Brown the best in her new
endeavors to expand valuable library
services in America and around the
world, and I know that the ALA is in
great hands.

COMMEMORATING STONEWALL
PIONEERS OF LGBTQ MOVEMENT
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
CUELLAR). The Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN) for
5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
and still I rise, a proud American, and
I am especially proud today because I
rise to acknowledge that we have filed
a resolution, H. Res. 464, that is styled
the Original LGBTQ Pride Month Reso-
lution of 2019.
I am proud to be a sponsor of the
Pride resolution, but I am not doing it
alone. There are 78 Members of Con-
gress who are original cosponsors of
this resolution. ‘‘Original’’ meaning
their names will be right there on the
resolution when it is filed.
I am so proud to be a sponsor of the
Pride resolution, and I am proud to
read just a couple of passages from this
resolution and to address them rather
briefly. It was my hope to have some 30
minutes to an hour of time to speak on
the resolution, but circumstances in
Congress will not permit such to take
place.
This resolution acknowledges the 50
years since the uprising at Stonewall,
which will be commemorated on June
28 and will last for some 6 days because
that is the length of time that the
Stonewall uprising, or as some would
call it, the Stonewall riots or Stone-
wall rebellion, but 50 years since
Stonewall.
I would like to read the whereas as it
relates to Stonewall. It reads: ‘‘Where-
as, those who took a stand for human
rights and dignity at the Stonewall Inn
in New York City on June 28, 1969, were
pioneers of the LGBTQ movement, in-
cluding two transgender women of
color, Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P.
Johnson, who were brave visible lead-
ers in the uprising at Stonewall Inn.’’
Mr. Speaker, it is said that a great
person will always rise to the occasion,
but the truth is, it takes a greater per-
son to make the occasion. These two
trans persons were the greater people
who made the occasion that we will
commemorate on June 28 and the 6
days that ensue, two persons who took
a stand among many.
There were others, but there were
two among the many who took a stand
that literally has helped to shape the
course of history. Sometimes, it really
does take just a few to get the job done
of starting a movement that can
change society.
Mr. Speaker, notwithstanding all the
change that has manifested itself since
the Stonewall uprising, there are still
things that must be done. There is still
great work to be done because being an
LGBTQ person, that alone can get you
fired. Coming to work and saying you
have just married someone of the same
sex as you can get you fired.
LGBTQ persons do not have the same
rights that we have, those of us who
are allies of the community. They
don’t have the same rights. They have
them, but they are not being identified
and recognized. These rights don’t
come from people. They really are
something we are born with. Human
dignity is something that is accorded
every person by birthright.
Unfortunately, in our society, we
still allow this level of discrimination
against LGBTQ persons.
I want to acknowledge that while
there is still great work to be done, we
still must commemorate and celebrate
the great work that has been done. As
a Member of Congress, I pledge to do
all that I can to make sure that I pay
a debt that I owe to the LGBTQ com-
munity.
Finally, I would say this: A person
who helped to organize the march on

HONORING THE LIFE OF JUDGE
JAMES TORMEY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
New York (Mr. KATKO) for 5 minutes.
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, as a proud
American and a Member of Congress, I
rise today on the floor of the House of
Representatives to celebrate the life
and career of the Honorable James
Tormey III, one of my constituents.
Judge Tormey was a beloved father
and husband. He was a distinguished
judge and an honorable public servant
who passed away far too early on June
22, 2019, just 4 days ago.
A 1972 graduate of State University
of New York College at Cortland and a
1976 graduate of Syracuse University
College of Law, my alma mater as well,
Judge Tormey committed much of his
life to public service.
Serving on the Onondaga County
Legislature for 10 years and, later, as a
Syracuse City Court judge, supreme
court justice, and district administra-
tive judge for the Fifth Judicial Dis-
trict of New York, Jim Tormey earned
the respect, praise, and trust of many
in our community.
Over the course of his esteemed judi-
cial career, Judge Tormey took a meas-
ured approach in upholding the law and
applying it fairly. He firmly believed in
the justice system and worked to en-
sure everyone had access to it.
As a district administrative judge,
his most recent job, Judge Tormey su-
pervised the operations and schedules
of more than 300 judges serving in the
Fifth Judicial District, many of whom,
since his passing this week, have
shared stories of his strong leadership,
his commitment to ensuring justice,
and his respect for all. They have spo-
ken of his commitment to continued
legal education and pro bono work and,
importantly, of his friendship,
mentorship, and distinguished leader-
ship.
Judge Tormey was committed to
making central New York a better
place to live and work, and the impact
of his work went far beyond the court-
room. He used his role to address some
of the most pressing issues plaguing
our community, overseeing the estab-
lishment of local drug courts, which
are very successful, the opioid courts,
human trafficking court, youthful of-
fender court, and community court for
lower-level offenders.
His dedication to central New York
was visible in all of his actions, and he
will be truly missed.
Above all, though, and far more im-
portant to the judge, he was a family
man. He deeply loved his wife, Susan;
their children, Andrew and Colleen;
and his grandchildren.
Susan is now left to carry on the
great traditions that she and her hus-
band forged with their children and
others in the community. Sue is a suc-
cessful person in her own right, having
a long and storied career, including,
most recently, at Onondaga Commu-
nity College.
To Sue, I say Godspeed. Keep your
chin up, cherish your children and your
grandchildren, and continue to carry
on the legacy that your husband forged
in this community.
I ask my colleagues, in closing, to
keep them in mind as we honor and re-
member the life of this devoted civil
servant, Judge Tormey.
f
CENSUS RIGGING: A CONFESSION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY)
for 5 minutes.
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Mr. Speaker, the clock is ticking
down to the hour when the Supreme
Court will make its initial decision on
whether to include a citizenship ques-
tion in the 2020 Census.
This administration has repeatedly
told the American people, this Con-
gress, and the Supreme Court that its
reason for wanting to include the ques-
tion is to ‘‘help enforce the Voting
Rights Act.’’
It turns out, all that was a lie, and I
have the documentation to prove it on
my website.
Newly discovered documents and
court records clearly show that the
only goal was to achieve the desired ef-
fect of diminishing the representation
of communities of color while also en-
trenching the power of ‘‘Republican
and non-Hispanic Whites,’’ according
to the masterminds of the citizenship
question.
This may, understandably, sound to
some like an outrageous claim to
make, but we have the documentation
to prove it. You can go to my website
to see it. These documents were uncov-
ered thanks to the courageous efforts
of a woman who discovered and turned
over thousands of documents from her
father’s hard drive to pro bono lawyers
representing Common Cause in its liti-
gation against gerrymandering.
In doing so, she uncovered evidence
that is more powerful and convincing
than a smoking gun. It is basically a
signed and sealed confession.
The documentary trail of deceit be-
gins on January 7, 2015, when a Census
Bureau employee used her private
email account to contact a Republican
redistricting expert and urged him to
push for a citizenship question in the
2020 Census.
b 1015
The Census Bureau employee, a
Christa Jones, went on to become a po-
litical appointee in the Census Bureau.
Ms. Jones then became part of Sec-
retary Ross’ core team on the citizen-
ship question.
The redistricting expert she reached
out to was Dr. Thomas Hofeller.
Hofeller was widely known as the Mi-
chelangelo of gerrymandering for the
Republican Party.
This conspiracy picked up steam in
August of 2015 when Dr. Hofeller con-
cluded in a secret study he had written
that simply adding one question, a citi-
zenship question, to the Census would
facilitate a redistricting overhaul that
would be, and I quote from his work:
‘‘advantageous to Republicans and non-
Hispanic Whites.’’
In late 2016, Dr. Hofeller became the
first person to push the incoming ad-
ministration to add a citizenship ques-
tion to the 2020 census. Not long after,
Hofeller ghostwrote a letter that be-
came, word for word, the basis of the
Justice letter that had been cooked up
by Commerce to be sent to them that
set forth the knowingly fake voting
rights rationale.
In October of 2017, Secretary Ross’
general counsel arranged for his key
Census advisor to hand-deliver the
Hofeller letter to a top Department of
Justice political appointee at a secret
meeting. That fake Voting Rights Act
rationale then appeared in the letter
that the DOJ political appointee sent
to the Commerce Department, and the
U.S. Secretary of Commerce sat before
Congress and lied to our faces in an ef-
fort to cover up their illegal and im-
moral activities.
Let no one be misled about the pur-
pose of these efforts. They are a con-
certed effort by the current adminis-
tration to undermine the bedrock prin-
ciple of one person, one vote. Its pur-
pose is to undermine the ability of non-
White, non-Republican people and com-
munities of color to have equal rep-
resentation here in the people’s House.
These deceptive and anti-democratic
efforts must not stand. Even if the Su-
preme Court rules against us, we will
continue to fight for the principles of
one person, one vote and the Constitu-
tion’s requirement that all inhabitants
must be counted. Democracy depends
on it, our people deserve it, and we will
fight until we achieve it.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize

Dr. Messina is retiring this week fol-
lowing a distinguished career in aca-

Resources after serving as a professor
and associate department head at
Texas A&M University. He has been a
great resource when it comes to forest
science and is a leader in that area.
In July 2012, he led the Penn State
School of Forest Resources in the cre-
ation of the Department of Ecosystem
Science and Management. He has used
his years of expertise and knowledge to
focus on improving the responsible
management of soil and water, healthy
forests, and a diversity of fish and wild-

aimed at preserving the beauty of the
world around us for all to enjoy.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Messina for
his years of service. I wish him and his
wife, Suzy, all the best in retirement.
100TH ANNIVERSARY OF PENNSYLVANIA
RATIFYING THE 19TH AMENDMENT
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I recognize the passage of
the 19th Amendment providing women
the right to vote.
After Congress passed the 19th
Amendment in 1919, three-fourths of
the 48 State legislatures were needed to
ratify the new amendment. This past
Monday, June 24, marks the 100th anni-
versary of Pennsylvania becoming the
seventh State to ratify the 19th
Amendment.
Women first organized and fought for
suffrage on the national level in July
of 1848 at the Seneca Falls Convention
in New York. But Pennsylvania was a
center of women’s rights even before
the Seneca Falls Convention occurred.
Famous suffragist Lucretia Mott
joined with a diverse group of Pennsyl-
vania women to organize the Philadel-
phia Female Anti-Slavery Society in
1833.
In 1840, the society sent Mott as a
delegate to the World Anti-Slavery
Convention in London to protest the
exclusion of women at the convention.
Organizations like this were formed
all across the Commonwealth to focus
their attention on raising awareness of
the women’s suffrage cause.
The decades of effort on the local and
national level by women’s suffragists
resulted in Congress finally passing the
19th Amendment.
Today women play a pivotal role in
our government. The 2018 elections
brought a record number of Pennsyl-
vania women to the ballot box, and a
record number were welcomed to polit-
ical office across the United States.
Mr. Speaker, Pennsylvania can be
proud of our important role in the
women’s suffrage movement and secur-
ing the right to vote 100 years ago.

OKLAHOMANS IN SPACE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Oklahoma (Ms. KENDRA S. HORN) for 5
minutes.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate
the legacy and accomplishments of
Oklahomans in space.
Retired Air Force Colonel Stuart
Roosa was one of six Apollo astronauts
to fly solo around the Moon.
After growing up in Claremore, Colo-
nel Roosa studied at both Oklahoma
State University and the University of
Arizona before earning a bachelor of
science degree in aeronautical engi-
neering with honors from the Univer-
sity of Colorado in Boulder in 1960.
Later he graduated from the Aviation
Cadet Program at Williams Air Force
Base, Arizona, where he received his
flight training commission in the U.S.
Air Force.
Roosa was one of 19 people selected
to the astronaut class of 1966. Colonel
Roosa served as a member of the astro-
naut support crew for the Apollo 9 mis-
sion and as the command module pilot
for the Apollo 14 mission from January
13 to February 9, 1971. In completing
his first spaceflight, Roosa logged a
total of 216 hours and 42 minutes in
space. Following Apollo 14 he served as
backup command pilot for Apollo 16
and Apollo 17. He was assigned to the
space shuttle program until his retire-
ment as a colonel from the Air Force in
1976.
Former NASA Administrator Daniel
Goldin describes Colonel Roosa as one
of the can-do spacefarers who helped
take America and all humankind to
the Moon. Goldin said that Colonel
Roosa exemplified the talents that
NASA strives for: service to our Na-
tion, technical know-how, and an un-
bridled creative spirit.
CELEBRATING OKLAHOMANS IN SPACE
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate
the accomplishments and achieve-
ments of Oklahomans in space.
Skylab was the first space station op-
erated by the United States. This space
station spent 6 years orbiting the
Earth. Within those 6 years, two Okla-
homans were part of the three succes-
sive, three-man crews to live aboard
Skylab: William Pogue and Owen
Garriott.
Born in Okemah, Oklahoma, Pogue
joined the U.S. Air Force and fought in
the Korean war. In 1955 Colonel Pogue
became a member of the Thunderbirds,
the Air Force’s elite aerobatics team,
and then earned a master’s degree from
Oklahoma State University in 1960. In
1966 Colonel Pogue became an astro-
naut and served on the support crews
for the Apollo 7, 11, and 14 missions.
The pilot of record-setting American
missions in space, Pogue was one of the
few astronauts to ever go on strike
while in orbit to demand more time to
contemplate the universe.
Colonel Pogue and the three-manned
crew he was a part of flew the longest
and last manned mission aboard
Skylab from November 16, 1973 to Feb-
ruary 8, 1974.
Astronaut Owen Garriott was born in
Enid, Oklahoma. He earned a bach-
elor’s degree in electrical engineering
from the University of Oklahoma and
his master’s and doctoral degrees in
electrical engineering from Stanford
University.
Dr. Garriott served as an electronics
officer while on Active Duty with the
U.S. Navy from 1953 to 1956 and was
stationed aboard several U.S. destroy-
ers at sea. He was selected as a sci-
entist-astronaut by NASA in June 1965
and then completed a 53-week course in
flight training at Williams Air Force
Base, Arizona. He logged more than
5,000 hours flying time, including more
than 2,900 hours in jet and light air-
craft, spacecraft, and helicopters.
Garriott was the science-pilot for
Skylab 3, the second crewed Skylab
mission, and he was in orbit from July
28 to September 25, 1973.
The crew of Skylab 3 logged 1,427
hours and 9 minutes each in space, set-
ting a world record for a single mis-
sion. Garriott spent 13 hours and 43
minutes in three separate spacewalks
as well. He also held the FAA commer-
cial pilot and flight instructor certifi-
cations for instrument and multi-en-
gine aircraft.
Sadly, we lost Dr. Garriott just 2
months ago at the age of 88, but we are
grateful for the contributions and the
legacy set by Oklahomans, Colonel
Pogue and Dr. Garriott and their explo-
ration in space.

HONORING COLONEL FRANK
CHILDRESS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN) for 5
minutes.
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize one of America’s
finest servicemen, Colonel Frank
Childress.
Colonel Childress exemplifies the
honor and fortitude of the men and
women who make up our armed serv-
ices. Colonel Childress was placed on
an assignment in the Pentagon in 2001
and was set to arrive in Washington,
D.C. on September 6.
Destiny arrived in a humble disguise
when a clerical error delayed his house-
hold goods from being delivered on
time. He was offered the choice of a
new delivery date, either September 10
or September 11. He chose September
11.
The Colonel lived a mile away and
heard when the plane crashed into the
Pentagon. He turned on his TV and saw
the carnage that took place in New
York and immediately headed for the
Pentagon to help in any way possible.
In a time of crisis and panic, Colonel
Childress ran toward danger when
many would have fled.
Among the thousands who died that
day, Colonel Childress survived. Twen-
ty-six of his fellow servicemen and
-women were killed in the very office
he would have been working in that
day.
At first, he was nearly consumed by
survivor’s guilt, but instead of surren-
dering, he joined a Bible study group
for Pentagon employees. Once again,
he chose not to run and instead face re-
ality through his strength and faith in
God who led him through those dark
and difficult days that he would face
ahead.

H5174 June 26, 2019
In his immediate response to the 9/11
attacks and his fortitude in dealing
with the aftermath, Colonel Childress
is a paragon of bravery. He exemplifies
the words of Winston Churchill before
Britain was about to be under siege by
Germany when Prime Minister Church-
ill said:
There will be a time when doing your best
is not good enough. We must do what is re-
quired.
Colonel Childress did what was re-
quired in the service to freedom. His
actions set the example that all Ameri-
cans can share pride in and follow.

Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
recognize Leor Torchman Auerbach for
receiving the 2019 CityPAC Scoop Jack-
son Award.
Her service for over 20 years as an ad-
vocate and leader in Chicago’s pro-
Israel community make her an ideal
recipient for this honor. Since the
2000s, Leor has served as a long-time
CityPAC board member, and her orga-
nizational and fundraising approach set
the standard that CityPAC continues
to emulate.
She has served as the AIPAC Chicago
co-chair of the Young Leadership Coun-
cil and is AIPAC’s Illinois council
member. She leads Americans United
in Support of Democracy which has or-
ganized more than 1,000 events to cul-
tivate support for the U.S.-Israel rela-
tionship.
As a granddaughter of Holocaust sur-
vivors, Leor is a friend and supporter
to the entire community, and her ac-
tivism is an inspiration and model for
us all.

CONGRATULATING NEW PAL-
ESTINE HIGH SCHOOL SOFTBALL
TEAM
(Mr. PENCE asked and was given per-

minute.)
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to congratulate the New Palestine
High School softball team who capped
their record-setting season with a 10–0
victory in the State title game.
This is the Dragons’ third State title
in as many years. Over the last 3 years,
this dynasty has been unstoppable.
Their record is a staggering 90–6.
This season the Dragons won each
game of the State tournament by at
least 10 runs, a feat which has never
been accomplished in Indiana State
history. They are also the first softball
team in Indiana history to win back, to
back, to back.
Through everything, they personified
hard work and team spirit, and I recog-

PROTECT AND PRESERVE THE AT-
LANTIC COAST FROM OFFSHORE
DRILLING
(Mrs. LURIA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, today I am
happy to announce House passage of a
commonsense amendment to prohibit
Federal spending for offshore drilling
throughout the entire Atlantic Ocean.
Protecting our coastal Virginia dis-
trict from the threat of offshore drill-
ing is among my top priorities. One of
my first actions in Congress was co-
sponsoring the Defend Our Coast Act.
This bipartisan bill would forbid any
drilling, exploration, development, or
production of fossil fuels off the Conti-
nental Shelf in the mid-Atlantic re-
gion.
As a 20-year Navy veteran who
trained off the Virginia coast, I know
that having to dodge oil platforms
would impact military readiness and
undermine our national security. I also
know what offshore drilling could do to
Virginia’s beautiful shorelines and
thriving economy. This is why I proud-
ly cosponsored and continue to support
Congressman FRANK PALLONE’s amend-
ment to protect and preserve the At-
lantic Coast from offshore drilling.
I urge the Senate to follow the
House’s lead.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5175
June 26, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak
about the School Food Modernization
Act which would help America’s school
cafeterias modernize its equipment and
infrastructure.
Earlier this week, I was proud to in-
troduce this act with Congressman
MARK DESAULNIER. We know nutrition
plays a critical role in a child’s devel-
opment and for far too many children,
sometimes the only meal of the day is
the one that they receive at school.
That is why it is essential to help
schools access funding to purchase
modern kitchen equipment and infra-
structure.
Some schools may be using the same
equipment so long that it not only
serves a student, but, quite frankly,
served that student’s parent as well.
Food service staff needs modern fa-
cilities to serve high-quality, nutri-
tious meals that meet the school nutri-
tional standards. Our bill allows
schools to participate in a loan assist-
ance program from USDA to help them
acquire new kitchen equipment.
Schools would be eligible for Federal
guarantees, up to 80 percent of the
loan. It also strengthens training for
food service personnel who want more
education on how to prepare healthier
meals.
I urge my colleagues to cosponsor
this legislation to help students form a
lifetime of healthier eating habits.

HONORING THE LIFE OF PETTY
OFFICER RAUL GUERRA
(Mrs. NAPOLITANO asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to honor the life of Petty Of-
ficer Raul Guerra and the work of the
Bring Raul Home Committee.
Petty Officer Guerra was born in 1942,
grew up in Los Angeles County, was be-
loved by his friends and family, and
known for his love of journalism.
Petty Officer Guerra enlisted in the
Navy Reserves in 1965 and was deployed
to Vietnam as a Navy journalist. On
the evening of October 8, 1967, Petty
Officer Guerra volunteered for a com-
bat mission to support a major air-
strike over North Vietnam. His plane
was tragically shot down and crashed.
Due to heavy terrain and hostile terri-
tory, he was pronounced killed in ac-
tion. His remains were not recovered.
A local paper, the Whittier Daily
News, in 2007 reported that a local
Navy seaman’s remains had been
found, which was part of a long process
to return Petty Officer Guerra’s re-
mains home.
His former classmates, Ruben Valen-
cia, and Donna and Gary Petersen
formed the Bring Raul Home Com-
mittee. They worked over 12 years to
diligently spread his story, search for
living family members, and held many
meetings with the Defense POW/MIA
Accounting Agency.
The DPAA, in February 2019, notified
the committee of the closure of Petty
Officer Guerra’s case, that he would fi-
nally return home, whereby he received
full honors at LAX, Los Angeles Inter-
national Airport, escorted by numer-
ous, caring people.
Petty Officer Raul Guerra was finally
laid to rest after 52 years on April 25,
2019.
I extend my deepest sympathies to
the family and friends of fallen Petty
Officer Raul Guerra and recognize the
dedication and years of work shown by
the Bring Raul Home Committee.

PROTECTING PEOPLE FROM
UNEXPECTED MEDICAL BILLS
(Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.)
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.
Speaker, today our bipartisan group
led by Dr. RUIZ is introducing Pro-
tecting People from Surprise Medical
Bills Act.
This commonsense piece of legisla-
tion will give patients peace of mind
that an unexpected medical bill will
not leave them in financial ruin, while
setting up a fair, neutral process to re-
solve billing disputes between insurers
and providers or hospitals.
For far too long, costly unexpected
medical bills have caused financial
stress, negatively impacting patients
and their families all across the Na-
tion. That is why our bill bans the
practice of billing patients for unan-
ticipated out-of-network care. It is not
fair.
The patients may be incapacitated in
an emergency or may have selected a
facility that they believe is in network,
to be met with a costly medical bill, all
because one provider was out of net-
work.
Similarly, providers are between a
rock and a hard place because a Fed-
eral law called EMTALA requires them
to provide care regardless of their abil-
ity to pay. Our bill resolves this by set-
ting up a baseball-style arbitration be-
tween the medical provider and the in-
surer to compensate providers for care.
A similar New York State law has
been proven successful with out-of-
pocket billing records declining by 34
percent after 3 years.
It is time that all States have these
protections. I urge support for this ap-
proach.
f
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS
LAWSUIT
(Mr. TED LIEU of California asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute and to revise
and extend his remarks.)
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr.
Speaker, I rise to give you some facts
about healthcare.
Right now, the Trump administra-
tion is suing to eliminate the law that
guarantees preexisting conditions
healthcare coverage for Americans.
You might wonder what constitutes a
preexisting condition. Well, I am going
to give you some examples. Cancer,
which affects over 22 million people is
a preexisting condition.
Depression, which affects over 16 mil-
lion people has been deemed a pre-
existing condition.
Alzheimer’s, which affects over 5 mil-
lion people has been deemed a pre-
existing condition.
Epilepsy, which affects over 3.4 mil-
lion people has been deemed a pre-
existing condition.
If you, or a family member, or a
friend have a preexisting condition,
you are in deep trouble if the Trump
administration succeeds in their law-
suit.
f
AMERICANS DESERVE QUALITY
HEALTHCARE
(Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend her remarks.)
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr.
Speaker, since January, the House of
Representatives has passed bills low-
ering prescription drug prices,
strengthening protections for pre-
existing conditions, and making sure
Americans can find affordable, quality
health insurance coverage.
I know thousands of Delawareans,
small businesses, and millennials all
across the board are struggling to af-
ford the healthcare that they need, and
in 2019 that is unacceptable.
Many of us saw hope and help when
the Affordable Care Act was passed,
and my commitment to the American
people is protecting the ground that we
gained while strengthening this land-
mark legislation.
As part of that commitment, six bills
stabilizing the ACA and lowering the
cost of prescription drugs were incor-
porated into my bill, the MORE Health
Education Act, and the entire package
passed the House a few weeks ago.
This bill will help lower the cost of
prescription drugs by bringing generics
to the market faster, helping Ameri-
cans understand health insurance op-
tions available to them, and protect
those with preexisting conditions.
I am proud that this legislation
passed the House of Representatives,
and I look forward to working with the
Senate to ensure that these bills be-
come law.
Every American deserves quality
healthcare that is accessible and af-
fordable, and we will keep fighting for
our States and for the country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5176 June 26, 2019
It is our job to allocate funding
across the Federal Government to best
serve the American people. To put it
more simply, it is our job to solve prob-
lems.
That is why I wanted to take an op-
portunity to call attention to some of
the problems that the committee has
worked to solve over the past few
weeks.
The gun violence epidemic has dev-
astated communities across our coun-
try, including my own. And that is why
I am proud that the Labor, Health and
Human Services, and Education, and
Related Agencies Appropriations bill
for the upcoming fiscal year has set
aside funding for the first time for $25
million for the CDC to study and de-
velop solutions for this epidemic.
The bill also makes meaningful in-
vestments in combating the opioid cri-
sis that has torn far too many families
apart, increasing funding for the Sub-
stance Abuse and Mental Health Serv-
ices Administration.
It also ramps up funding to protect
title X family planning, helping low-in-
come families access the healthcare
that they need.
These are only a few of the ways that
the House Appropriations Committee
has worked to provide real, tangible re-
sults to lead to better health outcomes
for the American people.
I am proud of the work the com-
mittee has done, and I look forward to
our continued work.

PROTECTING PREEXISTING
CONDITIONS
(Mr. HIMES asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, one of the
proudest moments of my career in this
Chamber was the passage of the Afford-
able Care Act, not because it was per-
fect—it wasn’t—but because it changed
the lives for the better of tens of mil-
lions of Americans. Now, of course, we
are threatened with repeal.
Mr. Speaker, here is what repeal
would look like by the numbers. Over-
turning the ACA would raise the num-
ber of uninsured people in the United
States by 20 to 21 million people. Due
to preexisting conditions, more than
100 million Americans could face high-
er health insurance premiums or the
possibility that they might not get in-
sured at all.
Now, remember, as you consider the
claim from my Republican friends that
they will preserve preexisting condi-
tion coverage, remember that they
promised for 10 years to repeal the Af-
fordable Care Act, and they didn’t do
it. Then they promised to repeal and
replace the Affordable Care Act, and
they didn’t do it. So when they promise
to preserve preexisting conditions,
take that with a grain of salt.
But this is not just about the num-
bers. This is about real people in my
district. People like Tom, who was able
to start his own business once insur-
ance didn’t tie him to his job, or Rob-
ert, who was forced into bankruptcy by
healthcare costs, but doesn’t have to
fear that anymore because of the Af-
fordable Care Act.
Mr. Speaker, I do not exaggerate
when I say that repealing or striking
down the Affordable Care Act would be
a tragedy of enormous proportions. I
ask all of my colleagues to join the
fight to protect Americans’ healthcare.
f
CRISIS AT THE BORDER
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, last
week the Department of Justice tried
to argue in Federal Court that the
United States Government did not
have to provide detained children with
soap, toothbrushes, or even beds. The
department refused to answer whether
or not the children’s ability to go to
sleep was a requirement of providing
safe and sanitary conditions.
This is another despicable example of
this administration’s harmful policies
that are meant to do nothing more
than strike fear in the hearts of those
who come to our border.
They continue to try to hide this
from the American people. They told
Congress that there was no family sep-
aration policy. That was a lie. Now,
they are trying to explain away the in-
humane treatment of the very children
they have chosen to separate from
their families. I have been to the bor-
der. I have seen the cages and the foil
blankets. I have talked to the children
and the parents they have been sepa-
rated from. This is a crisis.
Yesterday, thankfully, the House
passed $4.5 billion in emergency funds
to strengthen health and safety re-
quirements for migrants of all ages, to
protect parents from unnecessary sepa-
ration or prolonged detention, and to
help address the root causes that are
forcing people to flee their own coun-
tries.
America is the greatest country in
the world. There is no reason that chil-
dren should be in cages or people
should be dying in the custody of our
government.
MITCH MCCONNELL needs to do his
job, pass this bill, and send it to the
President’s desk to be signed into law
immediately.

SURPRISE BILLING
(Mr. RUIZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to an-
nounce the introduction of my bill, the
Protecting People from Surprise Med-
ical Bills Act, legislation to protect pa-
tients from unfair and expensive sur-
prise medical bills. By working to-
gether as a bipartisan team of 30 origi-
nal cosponsors—and growing—we are
gaining momentum because we agree
that patients must come first.
For too many middle-class families,
receiving an unexpected and very ex-
pensive bill from an out-of-network
provider is devastating and can lead to
severe anxiety, depression, and finan-
cial ruin.
Our bill creates the most fair and
transparent system to end surprise
bills without picking winners or losers.
This bill is the best solution to protect
middle-class families from receiving an
unexpected and very expensive bill
from an out-of-network provider.
As an emergency room physician, I
know patients come first and must be
protected. That is why this bill in-
cludes the strongest patient protec-
tions of any surprise billing legislation
proposed in this House or Senate.
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to Dr. ROE
and the 30 Members who agree that the
Protecting People from Surprise Med-
ical Bills Act is the most effective leg-
islation in Congress to end surprise
billing once and for all.

ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRAGEDY
AT CAPITAL GAZETTE
(Mr. SARBANES asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, on
June 28, 2018, a gunman shot and killed
five employees of the Capital Gazette
newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland. The
Annapolis community, which I have
the privilege of representing, was shak-
en to its core and will continue to
grieve for years to come. But that
same community also reached deep
within itself to find an amazing resil-
iency which helped lift up the families
who were victimized by this uncon-
scionable act of violence.
On this anniversary and in solidarity
with those families as well as hundreds
of friends, coworkers, and acquaint-
ances, we honor the memory of Rob
Hiaasen, Wendi Winters, Gerald
Fischman, John McNamara, and Re-
becca Smith.
We must also confront the fact that
those targeted by this cowardly assault
were members of our valued local press
corps. In America we cherish our free
and independent press. We honor our
journalists who follow the facts and
find the truth. This terrible tragedy
struck at the heart of newsrooms large
and small across the country.
The day after this tragedy the Cap-
ital Gazette went to press—an inspir-
ing act of courage and determination
that rallied the Annapolis community.
Today, as we remember Rob, Wendi,
Gerald, John, and Rebecca, let us also
honor the courage of the whole Capital
Gazette staff. Their dedication, their
service to our community, and their
commitment to a vibrant free press are
a tribute to the journalism profession.

MUELLER REPORT
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-

Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I was very
pleased, and America should be very
pleased, that Robert Mueller is re-
sponding to a subpoena that was issued
through the chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, Mr. NADLER, and through
HPSCI, Mr. SCHIFF.
On July 17 Robert Mueller will ap-
pear before our two committees for 2
hours of questioning by each com-
mittee and let us know more about the
Mueller report.
The Mueller report is the most im-
portant book or document in this coun-
try. Everyone should look at it, read it,
and learn about contacts that the
Trump administration and campaign
had with the Russian Government and
how Russia influenced our elections
and will try to do it again. That is
what is in the Mueller report. At-
tempts to obstruct justice that did not
exonerate our President and specifi-
cally that Mr. Mueller said that if he
could say he didn’t commit a crime, he
would.
It is important that he testify, and it
is important that people learn about
the Mueller report and the danger that
lurks not only beyond our House and
Senate but within our government.

bers are reminded to refrain from en-

to see amendments highlighting the
important work being done with the

Importantly, the amendment also
calls attention to unfortunate delays
in placing Harriet Tubman’s portrait

from both sides of the aisle here to pull
together a combination of 15 different
concepts and amendments that we have
included in this one amendment here
and six of which are Republican amend-
ments. So I appreciate Mr. QUIGLEY’s
cooperation as we work through these
issues that are important to all of us.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to
the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.
KUSTOFF), who is offering an amend-
ment that is included in the en bloc.
Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr.
Chairman, I want to thank my col-
league from Georgia for yielding.
Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support
of my amendment to highlight the im-
portance of the High Intensity Drug
Trafficking Areas program that is
known as HIDTA.
I have had a fair number of conversa-
tions with law enforcement throughout
my district in west Tennessee, and
they have told me time and time again
that drug trafficking continues to be
one of their main concerns. Along
Interstate 40 in Tennessee, we continue
to see an increase in drug trafficking.
I think we can all agree that the
spread of illegal drugs leads to higher
crime rates which ultimately increases
the financial strain on our local, State,
and Federal law enforcement.
The HIDTA program provides funding
for additional equipment and man-
hours to carry out investigations re-
quired to arrest these criminals and ul-
timately stop the flow of drugs.
Mr. Chairman, I know that many of
my colleagues are experiencing similar
situations back home, and they under-
stand just how serious of an issue this
is becoming for the safety and security
of all Americans.
The bottom line is that our law en-
forcement needs the resources offered
by the HIDTA program to help keep us
safe. The HIDTA program is also a
good first step to combating the opioid
epidemic that is plaguing our commu-
nities. We must be proactive now be-
cause prevention is the best long-term
solution.
Law enforcement at the local, State,
and Federal level have all expressed
support for this amendment, and I urge
my colleagues to do the same today.
I also want to thank my colleague
from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER) for joining
me on this bipartisan amendment, and
I do appreciate the support of the
chairman and also the ranking member
for including my amendment.
b 1230
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois
(Mr. FOSTER).
Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chair, FinCEN’s
mission is critical to our national and
economic security. It is charged with
safeguarding the financial system from
illicit use and combating money laun-
dering.
Our amendment included in this en
bloc directs FinCEN and its agency
partners to make proactive efforts to
identify and oversee one particular
space, and that is cryptocurrency ex-
changes, wallets, and so-called
cryptomixers that try to hide the
source of cryptocurrency that is get-
ting transmitted.
FinCEN regulates exchanges and
money-services businesses that deal
with ordinary fiat currency. As
FinCEN recognized early on, money
transmitters that deal in
cryptocurrency are functionally no dif-
ferent, and it only makes sense that
they should also have to comply with
anti-money-laundering regulations.
That is why, since 2011, FinCEN regu-
lations have made it clear that these
kinds of entities are subject to the
Bank Secrecy Act. More needs to be
done, however.
As of October 2018, only 13 out of the
top 100 crypto exchanges had report-
edly registered with FinCEN, even
though most crypto funds from illicit
entities flow through these exchanges.
We need to send a message to these
agencies that they cannot hide in plain
sight, that they should live up to their
obligation or FinCEN and its law en-
forcement partners will find them and
hold them accountable.
I am a big proponent of innovation,
including in the fintech space, but no
one wants to see innovative products
and services being used to support ter-
rorism, facilitate human trafficking, or
enable criminals to carry out fraud,
identity theft, ransomware, or extor-
tion.
That is why I hope my colleagues
join me in supporting this en bloc
amendment, so we can encourage
FinCEN to continue its important
work in the virtual currency space.
The integrity and safety of our finan-
cial system depend on these efforts.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this en bloc amendment so
that we can encourage responsible in-
novation in financial services while en-
suring that such innovation is not un-
dermined by criminals who engage in
money laundering, illicit financing,
and a whole host of other cyber-en-
abled crimes.
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Wisconsin (Mr. STEIL), one of our new-
est Members, who would like to speak
on his amendment.
Mr. STEIL. Mr. Chair, I will start by
thanking Chairman QUIGLEY and Rank-
ing Member GRAVES for including this
amendment in the en bloc.
I rise today to urge support for my
amendment considered en bloc. This
amendment expresses congressional
support for the important work of the
Financial Literacy and Education
Commission, known as FLEC.
FLEC’s mission is to improve finan-
cial literacy and help Americans make
good financial choices. This is an im-
portant task, especially for at-risk
groups such as minority communities,
rural Americans, and other historically
disadvantaged groups. FLEC should
continue to support efforts to improve
financial literacy in our communities.
As a member of the Financial Serv-
ices Committee, I closely follow the
rapid transformation of the financial
sector. Thanks to innovation and
smart regulatory reforms, more people
now have access to mortgages, personal
and business loans, retirement prod-
ucts, and other financial services. If we
want all Americans to succeed and
thrive in today’s growing economy, we
must support efforts to provide edu-
cation on how to make smart financial
decisions.
Mr. Chair, this amendment reinforces
Congress’ commitment to financial lit-
eracy, especially for at-risk commu-
nities, and I urge support for this en
bloc amendment.
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from Mas-
sachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN).
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Chair, I thank
the gentleman from Illinois, our Appro-
priations Committee chair, as well as
members of the Rules Committee, for
making this amendment in order.
I rise to offer an amendment that
serves to remind the FCC that law-
makers who oversee and fund this
agency want answers.
It has been over a year since Con-
gress directed the FCC to investigate
the sale of geolocation data by wireless
carriers to third parties. Location data
has been sold through a supply chain
with little oversight, and we are seeing
this information end up in the hands of
bad actors. For just a few dollars,
stalkers and predatory abusers can buy
geolocation information to prey on
unsuspecting victims, a reality that
should set off alarm bells nationwide.
The FCC’s delay in reporting their
findings from this investigation puts
consumers’ security at risk. The FCC
must act to remedy its lack of enforce-
ment and transparency regarding this
investigation.
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Chair, I support
the amendment, urge its adoption, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chair,
again, I thank the chairman of the sub-
committee. He has done a wonderful
job putting together 15 good amend-
ments that we can all agree on, and I
yield back the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5179
June 26, 2019
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair, the Fed-
eral Trade Commission (FTC) has broad au-
thority to protect consumers and is tasked
specifically with targeting fraud, deceptive ad-
vertising, robocalls, identity theft, and online
privacy.
Hardly a day goes by when personal private
or financial data isn’t lost to an online data
breach or theft. Americans deserve to have
greater privacy protections for what they do
online. And we need an FTC that has the
tools necessary to go after bad actors and
hold them accountable.
I’d like to compliment the Appropriations
Committee for providing the FTC with a $40
million increase from FY19. FTC needs more
resources to protect our personal online data,
but I remain concerned that the FTC will still
struggle to fulfill its mission and hold compa-
nies accountable for violations of the law, data
breaches and particularly our children’s online
privacy. Every week there is a new report of
companies skirting the Children’s Online Pri-
vacy Protection Act. When the FTC does go
after bad actors it is often too late and the
penalties are too insignificant.
On the Energy and Commerce Committee,
my colleagues and I are working to improve
children’s online privacy protections. Recently,
as part of that work, FTC Chairman Simons
testified that a FTC $5.7 million settlement
with a company that illegally collected informa-
tion on children, in violation of the Children’s
Online Privacy Protection Act, was the largest
civil penalty in an children’s online privacy
case. Unfortunately, the penalty was too low
to ensure online companies are following the
law.
The video social networking app Musical.ly,
now known as TikTok, settled very serious
case where TikTok was collecting location
data on children that was discernible to people
in the neighborhood. TikTok made it very dif-
ficult for children and parents to close ac-
counts. TikTok made it practically impossible
to complain. And TikTok would not delete pro-
files after someone did close an account.
TikTok is now owned by Chinese company
Bytedance, which is valued at $75 billion. That
means that the FTC’s record setting fine was
0.0076 percent of Bytedance’s value. No CEO
is going to blink an eye at a fine that incon-
sequential. Companies will just see small FTC
fines as a cost of doing business and will con-
tinue to elevate profits over privacy, especially
when it come to our kids.
The FTC also has launched a probe of You
Tube for potential violations of COPPA and a
broad consensus has emerged that many
other bad actors violate the law on a regular
basis.
One of the reasons for the lack of enforce-
ment is too few resources focused specifically
on children’s privacy. Currently the FTC only
has 40 full time staff devoted to protecting pri-
vacy and data security for the entire country.
In comparison, the U.K. which has 1/5th the
population of the U.S. has 500 full time staff
in its Information Commissioners’ office. Ire-
land, which has 1/65th the population of the
U.S. has 110 full time staff in its Data Protec-
tion Commissioner’s office. Something does
not add up here.
My amendment encourages the FTC to take
enforcement action against companies that fail
to protect children’s privacy and encourages
Congress to give the FTC the resources it
needs to fulfill its overall mission.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendments en bloc offered by
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.
QUIGLEY).
The en bloc amendments were agreed
to.
AMENDMENT NO. 13 OFFERED BY MR. GROTHMAN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 13 printed
in part B of House Report 116–126.
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I have
an amendment before the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of the bill (before the short
title), insert the following:
TITLE IX—ADDITIONAL PROVISION
SEC. 901. Each amount appropriated or oth-
erwise made available by this Act (including
titles IV and VIII) that is not required to be
appropriated or otherwise made available by
a provision of law is hereby reduced by 3.1
percent.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 460, the gentleman
from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Wisconsin.
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
This is a series of amendments we
have seen, as we go throughout the
budget process, asking for an across-
the-board cut.
Right now, we are borrowing 18 or 19
percent of our budget, which is just be-
yond belief. The speaker before me
talked about financial literacy. We
need some financial literacy for the
Congress here. My colleagues cannot
continue to put out budgets in which
they are borrowing 18, 19 percent of the
money.
In the Financial Services and Gen-
eral Government appropriations, we
have a 5.1 percent increase. In a sane
world, we would have a 5.1 percent de-
crease. But I know who I am dealing
with, and I want my amendment to
pass, so we are only going to shave 3.1
percent off the 5.1 percent, which still
leaves a mammoth 2 percent increase,
not quite as irresponsible as what the
Appropriations Committee came up
with.
Sometimes, we are criticized for
coming up with these across-the-board
cuts, and I can understand the criti-
cism in that it should be more
nuanced. We ought to get rid of some
programs altogether, and maybe some
programs genuinely need an increase.
If we are ever going to do what’s nec-
essary around here—my experience is,
politically, people back home are will-
ing to take a cut. Again, this is a 2 per-
cent increase. They are willing to take
a cut if everybody takes the cut and if
they don’t feel like we are targeting
their program.
So we have an amendment here with
an across-the-board 3.1 percent reduc-
tion. I think it is something that prob-
ably should pass close to unanimously
around here—we will see if it does—to
leave still a 2 percent increase here.
That is my amendment, in general.
There are a lot of things in this bill
that probably, constitutionally, our
forefathers would be amazed that the
Federal Government was involved in at
all.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Chair, I rise in op-
position to the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Wisconsin.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Chair, this bill
funds multiple programs that are not
only necessary to the daily operation
of the Federal Government but also
have a direct impact on the lives and
livelihoods of American families, busi-
nesses, and communities.
I stand in support of the bill on the
floor today, which restores cuts pro-
posed in the President’s budget and fi-
nally invests in programs that have
been starved for funding under Repub-
lican leadership for the past several
years.
This amendment would not just cut
these programs. It would do so in an
arbitrary manner, without regard to
the impact on particular programs.
In addition, this cut would take fund-
ing well below even the level proposed
in the President’s budget request. Let
me say that again: It would bring the
bill below the President’s budget by
many hundreds of millions of dollars.
It would reduce by 3.1 percent the
funding available to the SBA to enable
small businesses to access loans for
working capital, fixed assets, and other
assistance to establish, operate, ac-
quire, and expand a small business.
It would reduce by 3.1 percent the
funding available to the Department of
the Treasury to counter terrorist fi-
nancing and money laundering and to
implement the expanded requirements
that Congress placed upon the Treas-
ury to review proposed foreign invest-
ment in U.S. businesses to ensure these
transactions do not threaten our na-
tional security.
It would reduce by 3.1 percent the
funding available to the Office of Na-
tional Drug Control Policy to make
grants to Federal, State, and local en-
tities that are on the frontline com-
bating the opioid epidemic.
Mr. Chair, for these reasons, I strong-
ly oppose this amendment and urge my
colleagues to do the same, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I will
point out that, at least with regard to
things like the Small Business Admin-
istration, one has to realize that we
had a booming private sector in this
country before the SBA. The idea that
we need an increase here at a time
when the economy is the best it has
been in my lifetime can be questioned.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Chair, I urge op-
position, and I yield back the balance
of my time.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 460, the gentleman
from Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY) and the
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. GRAVES)
each will control 10 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Illinois.
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, the amendments included
in the en bloc were made in order by
the rule. This package includes amend-
ments that cover a broad range of
issues across the Financial Services
and General Government bill.
Mr. Chair, I support the amendment
and urge its adoption, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I
rise in opposition to this amendment.
This is another en bloc amendment,
and, unlike the one we spoke on pre-
viously, this is purely a partisan
amendment with really no reflection of
a bipartisan tone whatsoever. In fact,
it is really nothing more than a par-
tisan attack on the administration and
an attempt to make their lives a little
bit more difficult, which we see every
day around this place.
It would be nice if the other side
would recognize that the administra-
tion needs certain resources and needs
access to those resources in order to
carry out the functions of their job,
just like we do here.
Mr. Chair, because of those reasons, I
object to the amendment, encourage a
‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COHEN).
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chair, this should be
bipartisan because this is protecting
America and protecting our Constitu-
tion, which we have all sworn an oath
to uphold.
This amendment will require the
Trump administration to abide by the
Emoluments Clause. The Emoluments
Clause to the Constitution says that
the President shouldn’t be getting
moneys from the Federal Government
over and beyond his salary. Yet, money
spent at the Trump Hotel, at the
Trump Hotel in Ireland where they
went to Doonbeg, and at the Trump
Hotel in Scotland and other places
where Trump makes his journeys,
whether they are within the scope of
his original overseas purpose of going
to London and D-day but diverting to
Doonbeg to play golf and to let people
know about his golf course and his
hotel there, charging the government
for the golf carts that the Secret Serv-
ice uses, and the rooms, drinks, and
food at his hotel, et cetera.
The Washington Post reported nearly
$1 million in revenue already spent by
Federal Government agencies at
Trump properties.
The Constitution does not permit it.
It should be bipartisan.
The gentleman says that these are
attacks and that the administration
needs certain types of latitude. It needs
resources.
Well, the Trump family doesn’t. If
this President did like every other
President and divested himself of own-
ership of his properties, then we
wouldn’t have this problem, but he
didn’t do it. From day one, they have
been making money, and they have
also been advertising their product.
b 1245
Every time they advertise Trump
properties, they are using the govern-
ment as a way to expand the Presi-
dent’s wealth.
So I would ask that we abide by our
oaths, enforce the Emoluments Clause,
and stop the Trump businesses from
taking money from the Federal Gov-
ernment, which they are not supposed
to do.
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. DEUTCH).
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Chair, I urge my
colleagues to support this entire

amendment, in particular, the Jayapal-
Deutch amendment to bolster the Fed-
eral Election Commission’s enforce-
ment of prohibitions against foreign in-
terference in American elections.
Director of National Intelligence Dan
Coats said: ‘‘Frankly, the United
States is under attack,’’ and, ‘‘The in-
telligence community continues to be
concerned about the threats of upcom-
ing U.S. elections . . . in 2020.’’
FBI Director Christopher Wray said
that our adversaries are ‘‘adapting’’
and ‘‘upping their game’’ as we head
into the 2020 elections.
The people charged with protecting
our national security are ringing alarm
bells. That is why it is so troubling to
hear President Trump say that he
would listen to a foreign power’s elec-
tion assistance and maybe—maybe—
call the FBI.
Well, FEC Chair Ellen Weintraub re-
sponded to the President’s comments
with alarm, when she said: ‘‘I would
not have thought that I needed to say
this. . . . Let me make something 100
percent clear: It is illegal for any per-
son to solicit, accept, or receive any-
thing of value from a foreign national
in connection with a U.S. election.’’
It is true, she shouldn’t have to say
that, and Representative JAYAPAL and
I shouldn’t have to file this amend-
ment. It should be clear to every Amer-
ican that our elections are for Ameri-
cans to have a say in their government
and should be defended against foreign
interference. But, apparently, the
President needs some clarity.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment and support elections free
from foreign interference.
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Chair, I strongly
urge support of this amendment, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendments en bloc offered by
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.
QUIGLEY).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chair-
man, I demand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendments en bloc
offered by the gentleman from Illinois
will be postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 18 OFFERED BY MR. CONNOLLY
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 18 printed
in part B of House Report 116–126.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of the bill (before the short
title), insert the following:
TITLE IX—ADDITIONAL PROVISION
SEC. 901. None of the funds made available
by this Act may be used by the Office of Per-
sonnel Management to implement or carry
out any furloughs or reductions in force of
employees of the Office.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 460, the gentleman
from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Virginia.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chair, the
Trump administration is currently
threatening Congress with the furlough
of 150 employees at the Office of Per-
sonnel Management unless we, the
Congress, acquiesce to the administra-
tion’s so-called plan to abolish OPM al-
together and give the Trump White
House control of governmentwide Fed-
eral employee policies.
My amendment would put an end to
the administration’s plan to use the ca-
reers of 150 loyal civil servants as bar-
gaining chips for the proposal to abol-
ish OPM altogether. This proposal
lacks merit, justification, or even a co-
herent rationale.
And you don’t have to take my word
for it. The Government Accountability
Office has testified that OPM’s leaders
‘‘have not established outcome-ori-
ented goals, developed a cost-benefit
analysis or implementation plans, and
have not fully involved or commu-
nicated their efforts with the Congress,
employees, and other key stake-
holders.’’
Both Republicans and Democrats
have expressed similar skepticism
about this plan here in the House and
in the other body.
My Republican counterpart in the
Senate, Chairman JAMES LANKFORD,
has said: It is hard to get to the deter-
mination of how this makes anything
better, meaning the proposal.
The Federal Government’s most es-
sential resource is its 2.6 million em-
ployees, who comprise the most profes-
sional, nonpartisan civil service in the
world. Developing and enforcing the
policies to protect them from political
interference has been the task of the
independent agency OPM.
OPM administers the largest em-
ployer-sponsored health insurance pro-
gram and processes retirement benefits
for 2.5 million Federal retirees and sur-
vivors. It vets and trains candidates for
some of our Nation’s most important
civil service positions. It also provides
dental, vision, and medical insurance
to 8 million Federal employees and
their families. In short, Mr. Chairman,
OPM is the agency that serves the peo-
ple who serve the American people.
We have watched as this administra-
tion has attempted to curtail the inde-
pendence of the civil service itself and
reverse more than a century of pro-
tected reforms implemented by profes-
sionals in the civil service and to insu-
late them from political influence. Now
the administration is holding the ca-
reers of 150 civil servants hostage in an
attempt to force Congress’ hand to this
terrible idea. Much is at stake, and we
cannot allow civil servants to serve as
bargaining chips.
On May 21, my subcommittee held a
hearing that eviscerated the adminis-
tration’s half-baked plan to eliminate
OPM, and criticism was bipartisan. I
told Acting Director Weichert then
that the plan was dead on arrival and
that she needed to start over to find a
way that we could work together on a
bipartisan basis to improve this essen-
tial agency. She said she would, and I
took her at her word.
Despite clear messages and continued
oversight, Ms. Weichert has moved for-
ward with plans that further weaken
an agency in need and failed to live up
to her end of the agreement. Just last
week, OPM officials announced their
intention to lay off or possibly fur-
lough 150 employees because they could
not afford to keep them on the payroll,
they said. This threat was made in
spite of proposed appropriations levels
above what would be needed to fill any
anticipated budget gap.
The administration’s inadequate
plan, if one can call it a plan, to dis-
mantle OPM has been a disaster. Now,
after realizing they can’t prevail on the
merits of their proposal, unfortunately,
the administration is resorting to
blackmail. They are willing to risk the
livelihoods of 150 members of our civil
service—men and women who have
dedicated their careers to serving the
Federal workforce that serves the
American public—and on a plan that
fails the sniff test.
I have worked with my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to put language
in appropriations bills that prohibit
the administration from using Federal
funding to implement any part of this
reorganization plan. I now seek to add
an amendment that would prohibit
OPM’s threatened furloughs or a reduc-
tion in force.
I have also filed an amendment for
the Fiscal Year 2020 National Defense
Authorization Act that would require
OPM to halt its reorganization effort
and consult with Congress.
On Thursday, my subcommittee will
hold OPM officials accountable for the
lack of documents provided to Congress
about the plan to eliminate OPM; and,
at that hearing, I intend to tell OPM
that they will not dismantle a critical
Federal agency on my watch.
Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise in opposition to the amend-
ment, and not in opposition to Mr.
CONNOLLY in any way. I know that he
is representing his district, his con-
stituents, and his interests in OPM
doing their job and doing it well. But
there are some challenges.
There is no doubt OPM has made it
clear they want to perform their duties
and their function, but in order to do
that, they must reorganize. They must
modernize. They must update them-
selves as an agency and an organiza-
tion.
We are seeing that across all agen-
cies, but this one in particular needs
some assistance.
Mr. Chairman, I will add, their cur-
rent funding, where they are today, is

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5185
June 26, 2019
what is driving them to this decision to
make this notice that, if things don’t
improve, they really don’t have any
other choice but to furlough individ-
uals. Their option is to reorganize.
But why are we in this position? It is
because of the conference committee
report earlier this year. The Financial
Services bill was a part of the con-
ference committee report. You will re-
call that.
Maybe the focus was more on home-
land security and on border walls and
border security and other things, but
this bill was a part of that. As a result
of the product that came out of this
body under the new majority, it was in-
sufficient for OPM. Therefore, they are
having to forewarn of decisions they
are going to have to make.
But we should give them credit. They
are looking for an alternative, and that
is to reorganize, to change, to mod-
ernize, to update.
But do you know what, Mr. Chair-
man? In this bill, the underlying bill—
not this amendment—they are prohib-
ited from protecting these jobs. As a
result of this bill, under this majority,
they are prohibited from protecting the
jobs.
Now an amendment comes all the
way back around the other end to say:
Wait. You can’t do what you want to
do to protect those jobs, and you can’t
fire anybody. You can’t furlough any-
body. You can’t reorganize.
What are they to do? What are they
to do?
So I heard a really nice argument for
this amendment, but I really didn’t
hear a solution for OPM.
It would be nice that, if we are going
to micromanage—and I think we heard
a great quote yesterday: ‘‘Just because
you can micromanage doesn’t mean
you have to.’’ But if we are, maybe we
should provide some guidance and some
assistance.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, I move to
strike the last word as the designee of
the chairman of the subcommittee.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in
strong support of this amendment, and
I thank Mr. CONNOLLY, who is a leader
on issues of effective government. He
served as the head of government, as a
matter of fact, in Fairfax County, and
is one of our experts in this area.
I want to say to my friend, Mr.
GRAVES, the issue here for me is not
that we don’t need to make OPM more
efficient. I agree with his premise. We
do need to do that.
But the reorganization that is sug-
gested in merging the Office of Per-
sonnel Management with the General
Services Administration is, in my opin-
ion, very bad logic. The General Serv-
ices Administration deals with real
property, with inanimate objects; OPM
deals with human resources. There is
no match between those two.
Making OPM an effective, efficient
organization is an objective that we
ought to all share. And I know that Mr.
CONNOLLY shares that objective, and I
know that Mr. CONNOLLY, Mr. GRAVES,
and Mr. QUIGLEY, working together,
could certainly effect that end, which I
would support. But I do not support
what I perceive to be a retaliatory sug-
gestion about laying off people at OPM.
In other words, if we can’t merge it, we
are going to lay them off.
Frankly, if there is evidence that
there are too many people and enough
people to do the job that is being done
and that we can transfer people to
other agencies that might need them,
that is one thing, but I don’t think
that is the evidence that we see. And,
clearly, there will be sufficient funds in
the budget that Mr. QUIGLEY has of-
fered to make sure that we have an ef-
ficient, effective Office of Personnel
Management.
Unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, my
perception is that there is a hostility,
frankly, toward the Federal workforce
in this administration. I think that is
unfortunate.
Whether you think government
ought to be small or large, you ought
to agree on the fact that, whatever size
it is, we ought to have an effective
human resource agency so that the mo-
rale of our employees and the com-
petency of our employees, the work
ethic of our employees, the benefits ad-
ministration for our employees is all
done in an effective, efficient manner.
So I would hope that we would make
sure that we don’t get into this retalia-
tory political response rather than a
substantive response. I think that is
what Mr. CONNOLLY’s amendment is
about.
I thank Mr. GRAVES for his com-
ments, but I would urge my colleagues
to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the Connolly amend-
ment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chair-
man, I appreciate the leader’s com-
ments. He is an observant Member,
been here for many years. He has seen
how government operates. And, quite
frankly, there have not been too many
examples of the consolidation of gov-
ernment agencies.
But in a time of technology and ad-
vancements and modernization, I think
government could merge some things
together, could find some synergies,
could save some dollars; and in this
economy that we are experiencing
today, what better time to do that?
The unemployment rate is at the
lowest it has been in 51 years. Allowing
others to experience that opportunity
of growth and wealth throughout the
economy and additional job opportuni-
ties, take their skills somewhere else,
that is great.
But that is not really what OPM
wants to do. They are being forced to
do that because of last year’s—or ear-
lier this year, the inadequacy of a fund-
ing bill that put them in this position.
It was the first big test of this new ma-
jority, and, unfortunately, it put these
agencies in a tough spot.
b 1300
The only choice is to come up with
other ideas and solutions, and that is,
maybe we have to reorganize, maybe
we have to modernize, but certainly we
have to analyze how we can serve the
American people better. In some cases,
that might mean we can be leaner,
more efficient, and more effective, and
that might mean merging different
agencies together and creating some
new synergies.
Mr. Chair, with that, I will oppose
the amendment and ask others to do
the same. I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY).

AMENDMENT NO. 19 OFFERED BY MR. BANKS
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 19 printed
in part B of House Report 116–126.
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chairman, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of the bill (before the short
title), insert the following:
TITLE IX—ADDITIONAL PROVISION
SEC. 901. Each amount appropriated or oth-
erwise made available by this Act (including
titles IV and VIII), except those amounts
made available to the Department of De-
fense, that is not required to be appropriated
or otherwise made available by a provision of
law is hereby reduced by 14 percent.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 460, the gentleman
from Indiana (Mr. BANKS) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Indiana.
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chairman, here we
are again debating another spending
package that does absolutely nothing
to address our $22 trillion national
debt.
The bill before us today proposes to
spend $24.5 billion, which is more than
$1.4 billion over last year’s total. This
puts us further down a path toward
busting the budget caps.
Mr. Chair, I respect my colleagues on
the other side of the aisle, but I sin-
cerely worry that they do not under-
stand the dangers that lay ahead with
these bloated spending packages.
Here is a glimpse. Our children will
face a less prosperous future and our
national security will be needlessly
threatened through the inevitable se-
questration that results from busting
the budget caps.
My amendment is simple. It would
reduce nondefense spending in this bill
by 14 percent, which is the level needed
to avoid the outcome that I just de-
scribed.
There is no reason that Washington
can’t do what American families do

each and every day, which is living
within their budget.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this commonsense amendment,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise
in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Chair, I always
like being lectured on how I don’t un-
derstand the debt and deficit.
As one of, I think, 38 Members of this
House to vote for Cooper-LaTourette, I
understand those concerns, but any at-
tempts to be serious about our debt
and deficit must include a big, bal-
anced, and bipartisan effort to address
those matters, not going after one of
the 12 smaller spending bills and say-
ing, See. There, we did it.
It would have to include appropriate
revenues. It would have to include ad-
dressing all elements of this govern-
ment, including the sacred cow of the
defense budget. If you are going to ad-
dress our Nation’s debt and deficit, you
have to look at the government as a
whole.
This is a similar measure to the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from Wisconsin, only it is more de-
structive to the cuts it proposes to
make across the board.
I will not repeat the same talking
points that I previously stated regard-
ing the harm that such indiscriminate
cuts would have on American families,
businesses, and communities. I would
just note this amendment proposes to
cut more than $2 billion from this bill.
This reduction would bring the bill
below the funding level provided in fis-
cal year 2012 under a Republican-con-
trolled Congress.
Mr. Chair, this amendment is harm-
ful. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chairman, a few bil-
lion dollars here, a few billion dollars
there, $25 billion over there, eventually
it adds up. That is why the American
people are demanding now more than
ever for their Nation’s leaders to do
something about a $22-trillion-and-
growing national debt.
Mr. Chairman, we are running out of
time to put our fiscal house in order.
Deficits will soon top $1 trillion and
grow to nearly $2 trillion over the next
decades.
My constituents back home in north-
east Indiana see this reckless spending
and ever-growing national debt and
they ask me every time I go home, Are
you serious?
It is a valid question, Mr. Chairman,
and I honestly don’t know what to tell
them, when we have spending bills like
the one before us that spends more
than ever before on this particular di-
vision, just like the other seven divi-
sions that we voted on previously.
I have offered this amendment now
seven other times in addition to today
in an attempt to prevent sequestration
and the devastating effects it will have
on our Nation’s military. Our national
security is dependent upon the state of
our fiscal house, and unfortunately,
these spending bills do nothing to pro-
tect the security and prosperity of our
Nation.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support my amendment to cut 14 per-
cent of nondefense spending in this bill,
to rein in out-of-control spending.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Chairman, I know
what to tell the people of Indiana: the
same thing I tell the people of Illinois.
I know what to tell my constituents
about this matter. I am from Indiana.
I tell them that I am serious about this
and that I am willing to work with ev-
eryone on the floor and in both cham-
bers and the President of the United
States.
But any serious measure dealing with
such matters as the deficit and the
debt, must be, again, much bigger than
this, much more balanced than this,
and much more bipartisan than this,
and it must recognize that it involves
revenues and cuts, reforms, restruc-
turing, and, of course, the Department
of Defense.
Mr. Chair, any time anyone over
there wants to address these matters in
a serious way, I am more than willing
to listen. As for this matter, though, I
strongly oppose it and urge my col-
leagues to do the same.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New York.
Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Chairman, there is
bipartisan agreement in this House
that there is no greater obligation in
our Nation than to our Nation’s vet-
erans.
I have an amendment before us that
increases funding from the Small Busi-
ness Administration’s Entrepreneurial
Development Programs, specifically for
the Veterans Business Outreach Cen-
ters.
These centers provide a wide range of
services to our veterans, including
training and counseling. They also pro-
vide transitioning service members
with a large network of successful busi-
ness advisers and veteran business-
owners.
There are over 800,000 veterans in my
State. These veterans bring a wealth of
skills and experience that make them
uniquely suited to be successful small
business owners. They have sacrificed a
great deal for our Nation, and it is our
responsibility to support them as they
transition to the next stage of their
lives and careers.
Veterans Business Outreach Centers
support an aspiring small business
owner through every step of the proc-
ess. They organize workshops that
walk veterans through the key consid-
erations of starting a small business.
They also help clients set up business
plans to help strategic, legal, and fi-
nancial requirements.
Mr. Chairman, according to the SBA,
there are over 2.5 million businesses in
the United States that are majority
owned by veterans. These businesses
employ over 5 million people and gen-
erate annual revenues of over $1 tril-
lion.
In the State of New York alone, there
are over 137,000 businesses owned by
veterans that create jobs and support
our communities.
In the State of New York, we have
the Arsenal Business and Technology
Partnership located in upstate New
York that provides support to veterans
and their spouses throughout not only
our State of New York, but New Jersey
and Puerto Rico, that are all looking
to start and expand or purchase a busi-
ness. These services are offered both in
person and online and are available at
no cost to veterans.
The SBA’s Veterans Business Out-
reach Centers represent an outstanding
opportunity to invest in our commu-
nities while also supporting the return-
ing service members who have sac-
rificed for our Nation.
Mr. Chair, I strongly urge the pas-
sage of my amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.

Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Chairman, I
thank my Nevada colleague, Congress-
man AMODEI, for his support on this bi-
partisan amendment.
Mr. Chairman, our amendment would
provide increased funds for the Drug-
Free Communities Support Program.
The opioid epidemic is hurting every
corner of this country, and southern
Nevada is no exception. We need to in-
vest in local, community-based solu-
tions to help people struggling with
opioid abuse.
Unfortunately, local governments
often have the fewest drug prevention
resources and funds, even though it is
the local communities on the front
lines of this crisis.
In every State and congressional dis-
trict, every day of the year, there are
first responders and paramedics treat-
ing overdoses and abuse. Our bipartisan
amendment will directly invest in local
community efforts to combat opioid
abuse in Nevada and throughout this
country.
Mr. Chair, I urge all my colleagues to
support this bipartisan amendment,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.

Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chair-
man, as the designee of the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. GRANGER), I
move to strike the last word.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I
yield to the gentleman from Michigan
(Mr. WALBERG).
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Chair, I appreciate the fact here
of striking the last word. I rise in oppo-
sition to amendment 36, which was en
bloc.
Despite the description of this
amendment, it would actually reduce
broadband competition, if adopted,
with tremendous negatives for my dis-
trict and many others.
It also frustrates broadband deploy-
ment, an important thing right now.
By requiring network sharing in
multi-tenant buildings, there is less of
an incentive for network operators to
build out or make upgrades to their
networks.
More importantly, nothing in the
FCC’s order that is the subject of this
amendment would prevent State and
local efforts from increasing access to
multi-tenant environments. Rather,
the Commission would clarify that
those efforts should be consistent with
Federal policy.
This amendment also raises safety
concerns. Technicians from varying
broadband providers would be required
to service the same facilities in a
shared setting, and this could lead to
unknown or unsafe environments for
these workers.
This amendment could also
disincentivize build-out.
This amendment would prevent the
preemption of an outlier San Francisco
ordinance which requires the sharing of
in-use wiring in apartment complexes,
office buildings, and other similar
buildings between providers.
b 1315
For years, the FCC has been pro-
moting facility-based competition to
bring broadband to unserved Ameri-
cans. Meanwhile, the Commission has
forborne from the vast majority of the
legacy competitive carrier provisions
of the Communications Act because
they did not work. We shouldn’t be try-
ing to re-create them on a local level.

This amendment would increase the
amount of funds dedicated to financial
and technical assistance for the people
with disabilities through community
development financial institutions, or
CDFIs.
People with disabilities and their
families face a range of financial chal-
lenges that often go unappreciated. In
particular, they encounter barriers, ac-
cessing traditional financial services,
accumulating wealth, and obtaining fi-
nancing to buy a home, pay for an edu-
cation, start a business, or buy an ac-
cessible vehicle.
Just this morning, I met with my
friend and constituent Peter and his
family. Peter has a disability and has
all kinds of important aspirations for
himself.
People with disabilities also face ob-
stacles participating in the workforce.
On average, they earn less than those
without disabilities. At the same time,
people with disabilities face higher
debt-to-income ratios and greater ex-
penses, and they are more likely to be
unbanked or underbanked.
The institutions that serve people
with disabilities face similar chal-
lenges, including barriers to the capital
they need to build and renovate afford-
able housing, community facilities,
and work spaces. The consequences are
direct and dire.
According to the National Disability
Institute, roughly one in three Ameri-
cans with a disability lives in poverty,
more than twice the average rate. And
because many people with disabilities
depend on government benefits, they
are often unable to save or accumulate
assets.
This situation should trouble us all.
Thankfully, we have institutions
that are well positioned to address
these challenges. CDFIs serve low-in-
come populations, including people
with disabilities by providing access to
affordable financial products and serv-
ices. CDFIs are certified by the Depart-
ment of the Treasury, and they have an
impressive record of success.
Increasing the amount of funds dedi-
cated to financial and technical assist-
ance for people with disabilities that
CDFIs can be awarded would enable
them to more effectively address hous-
ing, transportation, education, and the
rest. Crucially, that includes low-inter-
est loans that enable individuals with
disabilities to meet their own specific
needs.
To be specific, the need for this fund-
ing is great. According to the National
Disability Coalition, 33 CDFIs re-
quested more than $15 million in the
inaugural round of applications, that is
for fiscal years 2017 and 2018. In that 2-
year round, more than $5 million was
awarded. My amendment would in-
crease the total funds dedicated to
these awards to $6 million, annually,
up from the current $3 million.
We know these programs work. In my
home State of Pennsylvania, the Penn-
sylvania Assistive Technology Founda-
tion has helped 310 Pennsylvanians
with disabilities purchase assistive
technology, including hearing aids,
tablets, vehicles, roll-in showers, and
much more.
Through access to capital, individ-
uals with disabilities are able to make
purchases that concretely change their
lives. For many, CDFIs are the only
way to obtain a loan, a loan that will

allow them to live their life the way

My amendment today is a simple
one. It provides more support for two
critical programs that have helped
jump-start small businesses, create
jobs, and foster the American Dream.
The Small Business Administration’s
Veterans Business Outreach Centers
and Small Business Development Cen-
ters may not be household names to
some, but they have been a lifeline and
resource to small business owners
across our country.
Veterans Business Outreach Centers
provide counseling and training to eli-
gible servicemembers, veterans, and
military spouses. With 22 centers na-
tionwide, this program provides the
skills aspiring entrepreneurs need to
get their ideas and businesses off the
ground. At a time in which military
spouse unemployment is more than six
times the national average, these pro-
grams can help provide opportunities
for those who have served and their
families.
Small Business Development Centers
also provide essential services to small
business owners who fuel our economy.
These centers have trained hundreds of
thousands of Americans in developing
business plans and accessing capital.
These programs touch each and every
one of our districts, but let me tell why
it is important to the people of Bur-
lington and Ocean Counties in New Jer-
sey.
Small businesses are the backbone of
the New Jersey economy. According to
the Small Business Administration, ap-
proximately half of New Jersey’s pri-
vate-sector workforce is employed by a
small business.
By voting for this amendment, we
can empower these job creators to con-
tinue to strengthen our economy.
By voting for this amendment, we
can give back to those who have served
our country in uniform.
By voting for this amendment, we
can continue to invest in our programs
that have proven to work.
I urge adoption of this commonsense
amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.

from New Jersey.
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chairman, the amendment I have
offered increases minimum funding for
the IRS’ Tax Counseling for the Elder-
ly program.
Filing taxes remains a far too com-
plicated task in America. I am sure we
can all agree on that. This vital pro-
gram provides free tax assistance to
people age 60 and older. It is particu-
larly helpful to filers who have ques-
tions about their pensions and retire-
ment.
In my home State, New Jersey Cit-
izen Action is one of the grantees for
this program. They do tremendously
positive work, which will only be en-
hanced with additional funding.
There are several reasons to
strengthen this program:
First, older Americans are often sub-
jected to financial exploitation
schemes. According to AARP, every
year, abuse and exploitation rob older
Americans of $3 billion—and this is
only the amount that is reported. Hav-
ing another set of eyes on elderly fil-
ers’ finances would help to identify the
victims of these schemes and help us to
combat them.
Next, the ongoing controversy sur-
rounding TurboTax, which manipu-
lated taxpayers into paying to file
their returns despite being eligible to
file them for free, underscores the need
for programs that help those most vul-
nerable to manipulation. Relatedly,
the way we file our taxes is obviously
evolving at a faster rate than many
people can keep up with, including
those who have filed on paper their en-
tire lives.
Finally, the new tax law created ad-
ditional confusion for many filers. The
loss of the State and local tax deduc-
tion hurt many taxpayers in my dis-
trict, especially seniors struggling to
stay in their homes on a fixed income
who were surprised not to get the re-
funds they have come to count on.
So, in sum, we should do everything
in our power to protect older Ameri-
cans and ensure they can file their
taxes securely and with confidence.
Let’s help this program help even more
people next year.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr.
MALINOWSKI)
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Chair, I de-
mand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from New Jersey will be
postponed.
The Chair understands that amend-
ment No. 42 will not be offered.
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE ACTING CHAIR

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE ACTING CHAIR
The Acting CHAIR (during the vote).
There is 1 minute remaining.
b 1432
So the amendment was agreed to.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
The Acting CHAIR. There being no
further amendments, under the rule,
the Committee rises.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.
MCGOVERN) having assumed the chair,
Mr. COURTNEY, Acting Chair of the
Committee of the Whole House on the
state of the Union, reported that that
Committee, having had under consider-
ation the bill (H.R. 3351) making appro-
priations for financial services and
general government for the fiscal year
ending September 30, 2020, and for
other purposes, and, pursuant to House
Resolution 460, he reported the bill
back to the House with sundry amend-
ments adopted in the Committee of the
Whole.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the rule, the previous question is or-
dered.
Pursuant to House Resolution 460,
the question on adoption of the amend-
ments will be put en gros.
The amendments were agreed to.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the engrossment and
third reading of the bill.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed
and read a third time, and was read the
third time.
MOTION TO RECOMMIT
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I have a motion to recommit at the
desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the
gentleman opposed to the bill?
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Yes, Mr.
Speaker, in its current form.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit.
The Clerk read as follows:
Mr. Graves of Georgia moves to recommit
the bill H.R. 3351 to the Committee on Ap-
propriations with instructions to report the
same back to the House forthwith with the
following amendment:
Page 5, line 2, after the first dollar
amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $10,000,000)’’.
Page 77, line 16, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(decreased by $10,000,000)’’.
Page 79, line 24, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(decreased by $10,000,000)’’.
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia (during the
reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous
consent to dispense with the reading of
the motion.
Mr. QUIGLEY. I object.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Clerk will continue to read.
The Clerk continued to read.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
Georgia is recognized for 5 minutes in
support of his motion.
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, while I don’t support this under-
lying bill, I thought I would take a dif-
ferent approach with this MTR today.
We are heading into a long break. We
are going to be separated from one an-
other, and I thought it would be nice if
we just thanked the other side for some
of the things they have done in this
bill.
First, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank
my friends on the left for including and
codifying Hyde-like protections for the
innocent unborn. With this vote today,
it is encouraging that our friends on
the other side of the aisle do agree—
they do agree—that the lives of the in-
nocent unborn deserve our protection,
and that is in the underlying bill
today.
I would also like to thank my friends
for their strong stand against the grow-
ing threat and spread of socialism
around the world and recognizing that
democracy is the answer. That is in
this bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I am glad that we came together in
favor of boosting States’ rights, stand-
ing behind the 10th Amendment for all
of our States when it comes to banking
for certain small businesses. That is in
this bill, Mr. Speaker. Thank you.
Lastly, let me thank my friends on
the other side for recognizing the hard
work and dedication of our Federal em-
ployees. The majority leader has al-
lowed the 2.6 percent cost-of-living ad-
justment, a pay raise, to stay in this
bill.
Yes, Mr. Speaker, that raise does ex-
tend to all Members of this House.
That took courage from the majority
leader, and we want to thank him be-
fore we leave here this week. Thank
you, Mr. Speaker.
That is not what the MTR is about,
but we just wanted to say ‘‘thank you’’
for a moment.
This MTR focuses on one major bi-
partisan issue, Mr. Speaker: keeping us
out of war and enforcing sanctions,
sanctions against Iran, North Korea,
Venezuela, Russia, and others which
seek to harm our Nation.
I can think of no one better that I
could yield to at this moment to dis-
cuss the importance of this MTR than
a Green Beret who has served in mul-
tiple combat missions around the
world, has 20 years of service in the
U.S. Army, an American hero, our
colonel of the Army, MIKE WALTZ from
Florida.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Florida (Mr. WALTZ).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5195
June 26, 2019
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, this mo-
tion amends the bill by adding $10 mil-
lion for the Office of Terrorism and Fi-
nancial Intelligence, Department of
the Treasury. This office plays a key
role in countering our most critical na-
tional security threats by imple-
menting sanctions.
As a Green Beret, I have fought in
the war on terror, and I can tell you
this office is vital to the safety of our
Nation and preventing war. In light of
our current threats, this office requires
an additional $10 million to accomplish
its goals.
This motion will implement sanc-
tions policy toward Russia, North
Korea, ISIS, and, particularly, the Ira-
nian regime, the world’s largest state
sponsor of terrorism.
I am personally well aware of the
grave threat Iran poses to the security
of our country. I have lived it. I have
dealt with the Iranians and their prox-
ies all over the world. They are an
enemy of this country and our ally
Israel, and that does not change re-
gardless of whether my colleagues are
Republicans or Democrats.
Mr. Speaker, no one wants war. In
fact, we want to drive Iran back to the
negotiating table to prevent war. The
best way to do that is to exert max-
imum pressure on its economy because
what the regime cares about the most
is not the Iranian people—is not the
Iranian people—but lining its own
pockets.
All indications from the intelligence
community are that the economic pres-
sure campaign is working. Iran’s cur-
rency is tanking. Inflation is on the
rise. Oil exports are drying up. Most
importantly, Iran is unable to pay its
terrorist proxies like Hezbollah and
Hamas.
Specifically, this motion would fund
sanctions on Iran’s leadership, on sen-
ior commanders of the IRGC, on front
companies, and on Iran’s terrorist ally
Hezbollah.
Mr. Speaker, I want to remind this
body of the marines we lost in Beirut
at the hands of Iran, the 500 Americans
killed by Iranian militias in Iraq, and
the American hostages held in Iran as
we speak here today, which include a
U.N. worker and a Princeton Ph.D. stu-
dent.
As a soldier who has had to fight ter-
rorism, no one wants to avoid war as
much as I do. I wear a bracelet on my
wrist of one of the Green Berets I lost,
and I wake up every day thinking
about how this body can be worthy of
their sacrifice.
Mr. Speaker, let’s support this MTR,
and let’s work together to avoid an-
other war in the Middle East.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
opposition to the motion to recommit.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Illinois is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I am
going to begin by quoting an eminent
Republican from Illinois, Abraham
Lincoln, because this argument and the
timing of it reminds me of what took
place in Illinois some time ago.
One morning, Abraham Lincoln ar-
gued before the Illinois Supreme Court,
and he made a point on a case. In the
afternoon, arguing for another client,
he spoke in exact opposition to the
point he had made in the morning.
When one of the justices pointed this
out, he said: I have had time to reflect
on that, and I changed my mind.
Mr. Speaker, we have just witnessed
the same thing. How in the world can
we take their MTR seriously? Just a
few moments ago, on an amendment
proposed by Mr. BANKS from Indiana,
they voted ‘‘yes’’ on two amendments
that would cut this account by 14 per-
cent, a cut of $23.5 million.
Apparently, they have had time to
think about it and realized, perhaps,
the error of their ways.
In addition, I would say—and I loved
working with the ranking member
when he was chairman last year—he
funded the same bill, as the chairman,
wrote the bill and funded it by millions
less than we are proposing today in our
bill.
Apparently, time changes our minds.
I don’t know where the gentleman
will be 5 minutes from now or whether
his passion for this will be as strong as
it was a half an hour ago, but the un-
derlying bill includes an increase of
$8.7 million above FY19, where my
friend from Georgia proposed this.
I started with the President of the
United States, Abraham Lincoln. I am
going to end talking about this bill
with the eminent philosopher from
London, who I saw last week in Chi-
cago, Mick Jagger. He said: You can’t
always get what you want, but if you
try real hard, you get what you need.
This bill isn’t perfect, but it is a real-
ly good bill under trying cir-
cumstances. And what do you need if
you try?
We are funding the IRS up to $12 bil-
lion. We included $600 million for elec-
tion security. Rather than eliminating,
as the President proposed, Community
Development Financial Institution
grant programs, we boost them by $50
million.
Instead of slashing funds for the
Small Business Administration, we are
increasing those funds.
We are also boosting the ability to
protect consumers and police bad ac-
tors by providing sorely needed addi-
tional funding to the agencies that
need them.
Finally, I think the most timely, im-
portant point is, when Mr. Mueller
spoke to the American public for the
first time about the report, he said this
was a systematic attack on our demo-
cratic process by our adversary, and it
has to be a bipartisan approach. This
bill does that with $600 million to pro-
tect against an assault on who we are
as a democracy.
My colleagues need to support this
bill and oppose this MTR.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit.
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion to recommit.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the noes appeared to have it.
RECORDED VOTE
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I demand a recorded vote.
A recorded vote was ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair
will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum
time for any electronic vote on the
question of passage.
This is a 5-minute vote.
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—ayes 226, noes 195,
not voting 11, as follows:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5197
June 26, 2019
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.
PERSONAL EXPLANATION
Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I
attended the Medal of Honor Ceremony for
David Bellavia, my constituent, at the Pen-
tagon. Had I been present, I would have voted
‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 420; ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No.
421; ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 422; ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall
No. 423; and ‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 424.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 962,
BORN-ALIVE ABORTION SUR-
VIVORS PROTECTION ACT
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker,
I ask unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged
from further consideration of H.R. 962,
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Pro-
tection Act, and ask for its immediate
consideration in the House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs.
LAWRENCE). Under guidelines consist-
ently issued by successive Speakers, as
recorded in section 956 of the House
Rules and Manual, the Chair is con-
strained not to entertain the request
unless it has been cleared by the bipar-
tisan floor and committee leaderships.
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker,
I urge the Speaker to immediately
schedule this important bill to protect
innocent lives, and I urge my col-
leagues to join me in this.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is not recognized for debate.
f
GUN VIOLENCE PUBLIC HEALTH
CRISIS
(Mr. LEVIN of Michigan asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam
Speaker, in recognition of Gun Vio-
lence Awareness Month, I rise to share
the story of a brave soldier named Ben.
Ben’s sister Mary is a Moms Demand
Action leader in my hometown of Berk-
ley, Michigan.
After her brother was honorably dis-
charged from military service, Mary
grew concerned that Ben was at risk of
self-harm.
Mary and her dad begged every fire-
arms store in the area they lived at the
time not to sell a gun to her brother.
She was told Ben could not be denied a
gun, despite the risks he faced.
Ben died by suicide shortly there-
after with a gun he had bought at one
of those stores.
Had Mary been able to seek an Ex-
treme Risk Prevention Order, Ben
could be alive today.
I am a cosponsor of the Extreme Risk
Protection Order Act and the Federal
Extreme Risk Protection Order Act.
Madam Speaker, for Ben and so many
others, Congress must act without
delay.
CONGRATULATIONS TO THE
SELINSGROVE, PENNSYLVANIA,
QUAD A BASEBALL STATE
CHAMPIONS
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, today
I rise on the day that Congress will
compete in the 110th Congressional
Baseball Game for charity.
I rise to recognize a local sports team
from a high school in Selinsgrove,
Pennsylvania, in the heart of Penn-
sylvania’s 12th Congressional District.
These young men overcame adver-
sity, injury, and people who just didn’t
think they were going to win, but they
did what we do in the heart of PA–12
and across our great Nation: they rose
to the challenge, they overcame the ad-
versity, they worked together as a
team, and they won the Pennsylvania
Quad A State Championship for base-
ball, a remarkable group of young men
that came together to make their com-
munity proud.
Madam Speaker, I wish best wishes
for this crew of young boys, men, their
coach, and the community as we cele-
brate the hard work and success they
have achieved.
f
UNLEASH THE STUDENT DEBT
STRANGLEHOLD
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, today
I rise to introduce the Transforming
Student Debt to Home Equity Act of
2019.
My bill would enable graduates cur-
rent on repayment to renegotiate their
student debt into an opportunity to
purchase and own a home, which, of
course, is an equity-accumulating in-
strument.
With an estimated $1.6 trillion stu-
dent debt, it is no wonder homeowner-
ship rates among young adults have
plummeted.
Luckily, there is a proven financial
instrument already in widespread use
that could facilitate a solution: the
home mortgage.
This common lending tool has the
power to incorporate student loan re-
payments into a means for building eq-
uity, not just debt: the home mortgage.
This bill directly asks HUD and the
Federal Housing Administration to es-
tablish a pilot program that connects
creditworthy Federal student debt
holders with eligible homes by arrang-
ing financing that recalculates terms,
debt-to-income ratios, interest rates,
community reinvestment thresholds,
and other factors.
Short-term student debt in certain
situations could transition into longer-
term home mortgage ownership oppor-
tunity.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation to
help unleash the student debt strangle-
hold on so many in the aspiring genera-
tion.
f
TRIBUTE TO MR. BILL HENDERSON
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor a local legend who re-
cently passed away in Lakeland, Flor-
ida.
Mr. Billy Henderson had a passion for
flying planes since he was a young
man. As a matter of fact, he used to
fondly say he started flying in 1946
when he was 16 years old and began le-
gally flying 20 years later in 1968.
Billy turned his passion into a life
purpose, and in 1974, he and four others
created SUN n’ FUN, a nonprofit dedi-
cated to promoting aviation education
in central Florida.
SUN n’ FUN has grown from hosting
a small fly-in, which attracted 900
attendees, to the largest annual con-
vention in Florida.
Every year, more than 100,000 visitors
come to Lakeland to watch pilots, such
as the Blue Angels, show off the best
that aviation has to offer.
SUN n’ FUN not only brings in $60
million to central Florida every year,
but also has an impact beyond the con-
vention.
The organization operates the Flor-
ida Air Museum, which houses over 100
aircraft, and sponsors over $2 million
per year in scholarships for aviation
education.
Madam Speaker, the skies over Lake-
land will never be the same without
Billy Henderson, but they will be
marked by his legacy for years to
come.

DISASTER AT THE BORDER IS
AFFECTING AMERICAN CHILDREN
(Mr. GOSAR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to highlight the disaster at our
southern border and how it is affecting
our children.
This afternoon, I want to read a let-
ter on the House floor from a young
constituent of mine, Mitch, an 11-year-
old from San Tan Valley, Arizona, and
he had this to say: ‘‘Dr. Gosar, we
moved to San Tan Valley a couple of
years ago from Flagstaff. I am 11 years
old and, I want to let you know how il-
legal immigration is affecting me.
‘‘My classes are overcrowded. The
teachers have to spend more time on
other children to make sure they are
able to take the State-mandated tests.
This is taking time away from my edu-
cation. Yes, they need to be educated if
they are here; however, why should I
lose instructional time because of the
laws?’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5198 June 26, 2019
He goes on further to say: ‘‘Do you
know what is being done to help with
smaller class sizes? Where are we with
border control?
‘‘My education is important to me. I
want to be successful in life. The ten-
sions are high at my school because of
the illegal immigrants. This is how
racism is perpetuated, not prevented.
‘‘I will be going to a private charter
this fall; however, I am still concerned
because my future wife may not be so
lucky to escape this problem. My
friends are not all able to switch
schools.
‘‘This is not the way it should be.
Please hear me. I hope that you can
offer guidance. No one knows what the
answer is.’’
This is how it is affecting students,
and I submit, it is a sad state of affairs
in southern Arizona.
f
CONGRESS SHOULD PASS THE
USMCA QUICKLY
(Mr. DESJARLAIS asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. DESJARLAIS. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to deliver a simple message:
It is time to bring the United States-
Mexico-Canada trade deal to the House
floor for a vote.
The USMCA is a big improvement
over NAFTA, the old North American
Free Trade Agreement. This deal is
fairer to American workers and compa-
nies in a variety of industries. Farmers
and ranchers get wider access to for-
eign markets, and new rules make U.S.
manufacturing more competitive. The
USMCA is the first trade deal to help
small businesses cut through inter-
national red tape.
The President has negotiated a deal
that benefits not only large employers,
but also small businesses and middle-
class families in Republican and Demo-
cratic districts across the country.
The USMCA is important to success-
ful negotiations with our other trading
partners. This and future trade deals
will continue the strong economic and
job growth that tax reforms, smart reg-
ulations, and more domestic energy
production have already helped to cre-
ate.
I urge Congress to pass the USMCA
quickly.
f
RECOGNIZING JAMES MADISON
UNIVERSITY
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, today I
would like to recognize James Madison
University in Harrisonburg, Virginia.
JMU was recently announced as hav-
ing the highest postgraduation employ-
ment rates out of all of Virginia’s col-
leges and universities. This is an out-
standing accomplishment for one of the
Commonwealth of Virginia’s largest
colleges.
Institutions like JMU educate stu-
dents and prepare them for opportuni-
ties that they might not have had
without a college degree. Graduates of
4-year colleges have completed the
work and are now tasked with the re-
sponsibility of finding employment.
Fortunately, for recent graduates, de-
mand for talent is high and unemploy-
ment is at a record low.
Congratulations to JMU on this mon-
umental achievement.
Go Dukes.

2020—Resumed
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under
the previous order, the Senate will re-
sume consideration of S. 1790, which
the clerk will report.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read as follows:
A bill (S. 1790) to authorize appropriations
for fiscal year 2020 for military activities of
the Department of Defense, for military con-
struction, and for defense activities of the
Department of Energy, to prescribe military
personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and
for other purposes.
Pending:
McConnell (for Inhofe) modified amend-
ment No. 764, in the nature of a substitute.
McConnell (for Romney) amendment No.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak as in
morning business for 90 seconds.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
INTERNS
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, ever
since I was elected to the U.S. Senate,
I have welcomed young Iowans to in-
tern in my office. Internships provide
students with the opportunity to gain
valuable work experience, to apply the
things they learn inside the classroom
to the real world, and to develop skills
they will carry with them into the fu-
ture.
That is why my office offers year-
round internships in both Washington,
DC, and in Iowa. I offer students the
opportunity to work alongside my staff
to learn more about our Federal Gov-
ernment, and it happens that about
two-thirds of my staff were former in-
terns. This is a wonderful educational
opportunity, and I encourage all col-
lege-age students to apply.
NATIONAL DAIRY MONTH
Mr. President, on another subject,
Wells Enterprises, the maker of Blue
Bunny ice cream, produces more ice
cream in one location than any other
place in the United States. That is why
Le Mars, IA, is called the Ice Cream
Capital of the World.
It produces over 200 million gallons a
year, which I appreciate, because I like
to eat ice cream. The Wells Ice Cream
Parlor is one of the busiest tourist at-
tractions in our entire State, and I
have been there multiple times.
With this being National Dairy
Month, I am proud to recognize Wells
and all of the hard-working farmers
and dairy workers who produce the
great dairy products that are enjoyed
across the country.
I yield the floor.
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
BORDER SECURITY
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President,
first and foremost, the American peo-
ple are continuing to hear elected offi-
cials talk a great deal about the hu-
manitarian and security crisis down on
the southern border. Both sides of the
aisle have talked a lot about this issue
for the past 2 months.
Here is the difference. It is the Re-
publicans who have actually supported
giving the administration and the
Agencies the emergency funding they
have been begging for. The Republicans
have raised the alarm about the condi-
tions on the border and have actually
wanted to do something about it.
Our Democratic colleagues have
talked a lot about the issue as well, but
for weeks and weeks, talk is all the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4526 June 26, 2019
House of Representatives has been will-
ing to do. The House Democrats have
been consistently uncooperative and
uninterested in anything except polit-
ical posturing. They have talked end-
lessly about the suffering at the border
but have resisted every effort to actu-
ally make a law and get help on the
way.
For 8 weeks now, the men and women
and children on our southern border
have learned the hard way that the
‘‘resistance’’ does not pay the bills.
The New York Times’ editorial
board, of all places, wrote 7 weeks ago:
‘‘Congress, give Trump his border
money.’’ This was the New York
Times. Yet, week after week, from the
House—nothing.
First, they objected to including the
funding in the disaster bill, and now
that they finally passed something last
night, it is a go-nowhere proposal that
is filled with poison pill riders that the
President has indicated he would veto.
They had to drag their bill way to the
left to earn the support of most Demo-
crats. As a result, the House has not
made much progress toward actually
making a law—just more ‘‘resistance
theater.’’
The Senate has a better and more bi-
partisan way forward. The bill nego-
tiated by Chairman SHELBY and Sen-
ator LEAHY won huge bipartisan sup-
port in committee. It is a productive
compromise that will go a long way to
beginning to address the border crisis.
There are no poison pills—just a clean
bill to provide the emergency appro-
priations the White House requested 2
long months ago.
We have waited long enough. We
should not wait any longer. We must
pass this measure this week.
S. 1790
Mr. President, on another matter,
the National Defense Authorization
Act is one of the most significant
pieces of legislation we tackle each
year. It addresses many national and
international priorities, but, under-
neath, there are countless local stories
of servicemembers, families, commu-
nities, and installations all across our
country.
A few weeks ago, I had the oppor-
tunity to help cut the ribbon on a new
state-of-the-art chemical weapons de-
struction facility at the Blue Grass
Army Depot in Madison County, which
is in my State. For decades, this depot
has been home to more than a 500-ton
stockpile of lethal chemical agents.
Now, following years of hard work and
advocacy, it will be, instead, the place
at which this toxic legacy of war will
be finally unwound. Earlier this
month, the new facility safely de-
stroyed its first munition, and this is
just the beginning. This work will con-
tinue until the entire stockpile is
eliminated.
The Kentucky accomplishment re-
minds us of the terrible role that chem-
ical weapons have played throughout
history. Mankind has conscripted
science onto the battlefield since war-
fare’s earliest days—from contami-
nating water to poisoning arrows and
bullets. Yet this fast-paced industrial-
ization of the early 1900s brought forth
a whole new wave of horrors.
The use of weapons like mustard gas
caused devastation in the trenches of
World War I. President Franklin Roo-
sevelt, in responding to the prolifera-
tion of these weapons by our adver-
saries, mobilized an unprecedented
level of chemical production during
World War II. While neither side de-
ployed chemical agents on the battle-
field, their murderous use in Nazi con-
centration camps and Japanese experi-
ments rank among the worst atrocities
ever.
Then, during the Cold War, these hor-
rific weapons brought new challenges
to our Nation’s strategic defense and to
communities like Richmond, KY. As
the first chemical agents arrived in my
home State in the 1940s, they were
stored at the Blue Grass Army Depot—
only miles away from schools and
thousands of families.
When I joined the Senate in 1985, the
Army had recently announced plans to
begin the destruction of Blue Grass’
stores through a process called inciner-
ation—literally, burning the agents.
Imagine that for a moment—just
throwing a warhead into an oven or a
burn pit. Fortunately and understand-
ably, nearby residents were concerned
about the release of toxins into the air.
Those fears only grew as we learned
about numerous nerve gas leaks at the
depot that had occurred over the pre-
vious decade.
What happened next was a textbook
example of representative democracy.
The people of Kentucky used their
voices in the U.S. Senate, and they
changed the policy of the Nation and
made the world a safer place.
It has been my privilege for the last
three decades to have worked alongside
this community for the safe destruc-
tion of these deadly chemicals. This ef-
fort would not have been possible with-
out having had allies like Craig Wil-
liams, an incredible local leader who
pored over every detail until he became
the leading expert on the depot.
Together, we stopped the Army’s in-
cineration plans and convinced the De-
partment of Defense to adopt the safest
and most advanced alternative for the
responsible destruction of the stock-
pile. It wasn’t an easy fight, but it was
a fight worth having, not only to pro-
tect the Kentuckians who were poten-
tially in harm’s way but also to uphold
our national commitment to destroy
these terrible weapons.
In 1984, President Reagan asserted
America’s leadership in calling for an
international prohibition on chemical
weapons. Over the next decade, we
made international progress toward
that same goal by joining the Chemical
Weapons Convention. The continued
work in Madison County is part of this
historic commitment.
Unfortunately, while the United
States has been taking these steps,
these horrific weapons have still been
posing a threat to international peace.
Some of our adversaries are choosing a
different path by preserving, modern-
izing, and using their stockpiles.
Remember that Syrian dictator
Bashar Assad’s use of chemical weap-
ons against his own people was the sub-
ject of the Obama administration’s
failure to enforce its own so-called red-
line. We also saw Russian operatives
deploy advanced nerve agents in the
middle of a residential neighborhood in
the United Kingdom just last year.
Thankfully, President Trump has
taken a different approach to American
leadership. On two occasions, this ad-
ministration ordered strikes on Syrian
military targets after the Assad regime
crossed the redline. As my colleagues
will remember, we also deported Rus-
sian agents and put in place new sanc-
tions following the chemical attack on
Sergei Skripal.
The Senate has taken action as well.
The first piece of legislation we passed
this Congress, S. 1, included the Caesar
Syria Civilian Protection Act, which
holds the Assad regime and its enablers
more accountable for recent atrocities.
The use of chemical weapons is a
stain on human history. It is time for
civilized nations the world over to turn
the page once and for all, and the Blue
Grass Army Depot is ready to do its
part. So this year’s NDAA will author-
ize the funding that this facility needs
and the resources for countless instal-
lations across the country. Each plays
an important role in their own commu-
nity.
I hope my Senate colleagues will join
me in keeping our commitment to fi-
nally finishing this national security
mission.
ECONOMY
Mr. President, on another matter,
speaking of the local impacts of our
work, we are continuing to see evi-
dence that Republican efforts to roll
back harmful overregulation and put
more tax dollars back in the hands of
American families and job creators are
working.
I am proud to say that my home
State of Kentucky is a strong example
of that achievement. With billions of
dollars in new investments, a rising
economic tide for working families,
and promising, new opportunities like
industrial hemp, it is no surprise that
an economic researcher recently called
this moment ‘‘Kentucky’s Best Econ-
omy Ever.’’
Month after month, more Kentuck-
ians are entering the labor force and
looking to put their skills to work. We
are currently experiencing the lowest
unemployment rate ever recorded in
our State. Job seekers are filling out
applications, polishing their resumes,
and preparing to clock in.
Employers are ready too. At last
count, Kentucky was home to more job
openings than individuals looking for
work. The economy in the Bluegrass
State is red hot.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4527
June 26, 2019
These are the results of the pro-
growth policies advanced by Repub-
licans in Washington and in State cap-
itals around the country—generational
tax reform, major regulatory reform,
big bites out of the worst parts of
Dodd-Frank, eliminating ObamaCare’s
individual mandate. All this and more
is helping American workers and
American small businesses gain more
opportunities, higher pay, and the abil-
ity to keep more of what they earn.
And the good news keeps coming.
Just last week, after nearly a decade of
the war on coal, the Trump administra-
tion finalized the rollback of an
Obama-era regulation that threatened
to shift Kentucky jobs overseas and
send energy bills through the roof. In-
stead of harnessing America’s abun-
dant resources of reliable and afford-
able energy, the previous administra-
tion tried to coerce every State to
drastically restructure its electricity
systems to conform to Washington’s
unfeasible and likely illegal restric-
tions. It is important to remember that
all that self-imposed economic pain
would have produced little to no mean-
ingful effect on global emissions.
I spent years leading the fight
against Obama’s anti-coal policies. And
with the help of the Trump administra-
tion, we are finally putting a stop to
Washington overregulation. Last
week’s decision replaces the so-called
Clean Power Plan with a regulation
that actually works with States to en-
courage energy production while also
protecting the environment.
This President’s commitment to Mid-
dle America is welcome news after
years of overreach, overregulation, and
policies which seem to have been
dreamt up for the benefit of elite coast-
al areas but which left a lot of the rest
of us way behind.
That wasn’t even the only positive
announcement from just last week.
After I reached out to the administra-
tion, they confirmed that the Depart-
ment of Agriculture will continue oper-
ating job core centers in several
States, including Kentucky. The three
centers that were at risk in Kentucky
provide important education and job-
training services to vulnerable youth
in some of my State’s most distressed
communities. Their work gives a boost
to those who need it most. I made an
appeal directly to Agriculture Sec-
retary Sonny Perdue and Labor Sec-
retary Alexander Acosta, and I am
pleased the decision was reached to en-
sure these centers remain open and
able to offer young people the tools
they need to excel.
These very recent wins are just the
latest few examples of Republicans’
focus on new economic growth and job
creation throughout all parts of Amer-
ica, but the list keeps on growing.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
S. 1790
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, there is
no more important congressional re-
sponsibility than providing for our Na-
tion’s defense. There will always be
those who wish our Nation harm, and
our Nation must always be prepared to
defend itself. More than that, our Na-
tion needs to be ready to defend itself
because being prepared for war is a
strong deterrent to conflict in the first
place.
As I have said before in this Cham-
ber, it is not our strength that tempts
our adversaries but our weakness.
Maintaining our strength will ensure
that bad actors, whether they are ter-
rorist groups or major powers, think
twice before attacking our Nation. In
the words of Ronald Reagan, ‘‘well, to
those who think strength provokes
conflict, Will Rogers had his own an-
swer.’’ He said of the world heavy-
weight champion of his day: ‘‘I’ve
never seen anyone insult Jack
Dempsey.’’
This week we are considering the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act, the
annual legislation to authorize funding
for our military and our Nation’s de-
fense. Like last year’s NDAA, this bill
focuses on rebuilding our military and
ensuring we are prepared to meet 21st
century threats.
While many take it for granted that
we have the strongest military in the
world, the truth is that in recent years
our military advantage has eroded.
Budgetary impasses combined with in-
creased operational demands left our
military undermanned, underequipped,
and ill-prepared for the conflicts of the
21st century. Meanwhile, other major
powers have made investing in their
militaries a priority, set on dimin-
ishing U.S. influence.
In November 2018, the bipartisan Na-
tional Defense Strategy Commission
released a report warning that our
readiness had eroded to the point
where we might struggle to win a war
against a major power like Russia or
China. The Commission noted that we
would be especially vulnerable if we
were ever called on to fight a war on
two fronts. That is not a good position
to be in, and restoring our readiness
has to be our top priority.
We are once again in an era of great
power competition, while at the same
time we continue to face threats from
terrorists and rogue nations. We have
to be able to credibly deter—and, if
necessary, counter—any threat.
This year’s National Defense Author-
ization Act continues the reinvestment
that we have made in our military. It
invests in the planes, the combat vehi-
cles, and ships of the future, including
the Joint Strike Fighter and the future
B–21 bomber, which will be based at
Ellsworth Air Force Base in my home
State of North Dakota. It authorizes
funding for research and development
and advanced technology. It authorizes
funds to modernize our nuclear arsenal
to maximize our deterrence capabili-
ties. It also focuses on ensuring that
we are equipped to meet new threats on
new fronts, including in space and
cyber domains.
It is important that we invest in
these new areas of the battlefield to en-
sure that we are prepared to meet and
defeat threats. And, of course, this leg-
islation invests in our troops, the men
and women who keep our Nation safe
and free.
This year’s National Defense Author-
ization Act will provide our troops
with a well-deserved 3.1-percent pay in-
crease, which is the largest increase in
a decade. It also focuses on addressing
the recent significant health and safety
issues with private on-base housing. It
contains measures to support military
spouses seeking employment and in-
creases access to childcare on military
installations. It also allows parental
leave to be taken in multiple incre-
ments, which is often a better fit for
our military men and women.
I am pleased that once again the Sen-
ate has taken up the National Defense
Authorization Act in a timely and bi-
partisan fashion. There are few bills
more important than this one. I look
forward to passing the National De-
fense Authorization Act later this
week and ensuring that our military
men and women have the tools they
need to defend our country.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER

Democratic leader is recognized.
9/11 VICTIM COMPENSATION FUND
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I
begin this morning with some welcome
news. After meeting with a group of
9/11 first responders last night, Leader
MCCONNELL gave them his commit-
ment to move legislation to reauthor-
ize the Victim Compensation Fund be-
fore the August recess. That is an im-
portant commitment.
I thank the leader. We have been
struggling for years to get not a quar-
ter, not half but the full Victim Com-
pensation Fund, as well as, of course,
the healthcare for those who bravely
rushed to the towers right after 9/11
and the awful attack.
Even more importantly than thank-
ing the leader, I want to thank the
first responders who came down here to
continue their advocacy. I have little
doubt that without them, this wouldn’t
have happened. Many of them are sick.
Some of them are dying.
This week, I spoke to New York po-
lice detective Luis Alvarez, who is now
in hospice and dying of cancer. He
would normally have been right next to
John Feal and the other advocates
meeting with Leader MCCONNELL be-
cause his illness never stopped him
from advocating for his compatriots.
Instead of him being there, John Feal
gave Leader MCCONNELL his badge. It is

not easy for a police officer to part
with their badge, but Alvarez, in his
usual selfless and magnanimous way,
knew how important it would be for
MCCONNELL to see it.
I remember my dear friend Ray
Pfeifer. Before he passed away, he was
the same way. He kept coming down, in
pain, suffering, and knowing that his
cancer, caused by 9/11 and the toxins in
the air, was incurable, but Ray knew
that if he kept coming down, it would
help others who had not yet gotten
those cancers but who were sure to get
them because they, too, had rushed to
the towers. His effort was about mak-
ing sure that friends and families were
cared for. That is what Alvarez stands
for; that is what Pfeifer stood for; and
that is what all the first responders
stand for, particularly those who come
down, and there are many of them.
That is the very definition of ‘‘self-
lessness,’’ the same selflessness that
compelled these men and women to
rush to the towers without a thought
for their own safety, to ensure the safe-
ty of others.
Now that Leader MCCONNELL has
committed to address this issue before
August, we are making real progress.
We have gotten to the 5-yard line, but
we are not over the goal line yet when
it comes to the Victim Compensation
Fund. There are still a few ways this
Senate could fumble the ball. I will be
there to make sure they will not.
As the leader well knows, there is a
House and Senate version of the 9/11
bill. The House has already passed its
version through the committee. The
full House should pass it in early July.
The best way to get this done without
fuss or muss, without somebody fum-
bling the ball, as we are on the 5-yard
line, would be to have the Senate vote
on the House bill. I hope that is what
the leader will decide to do.
I would also say to the leader, re-
spectfully, that he need not wait for a
must-pass vehicle. Based on the num-
ber of cosponsors on the Senate bill, we
have 60 votes. I want to thank my col-
league from New York, Senator GILLI-
BRAND, for working so hard to round up
votes. We have the votes to move this
bill separately on the floor and alone.
It would take very little of the Sen-
ate’s time to take up and pass the bill
whenever the leader decides to do so.
On an issue as important as this, we
should consider the legislation as
stand-alone rather than tucked inside a
must-pass bill because we know must-
pass bills often don’t pass these days.
Again, I appreciate the leader’s com-
mitment. It means a great deal to the
9/11 first responders.
I spoke to John Feal this morning.
He is very optimistic now but also told
me: Make sure we get this done. We are
not there yet. Feal and I agree. We are
at the 5-yard line. We have come a long
way, 95 yards down the field, but we are
not over the goal line yet, and we can-
not let a last-minute fumble, one way
or the other, stop the Victim Com-
pensation Fund from being fully funded
permanently or at least for as long as
can be, helping those who need the
help.
Parenthetically, I prefer permanent
or at least the 71 years that is in the
House bill.
IRAN
Mr. President, I also appreciate Lead-
er MCCONNELL’s commitment on an-
other front. Yesterday, Leader MCCON-
NELL promised that the Senate would
vote on the Udall amendment to the
Defense authorization bill. Democrats
have been urging the leader to allow
this crucial vote on our Iran policy. I
am pleased that this Chamber may
consider it. I am hopeful that the lead-
er and I will be able to come to some
agreement on the timing of that vote
soon.
This is a debate the Senate should
have for the sake of the Constitution,
which houses the power to declare war
here in this branch, for the sake of the
Senate, which has ducked too many de-
bates and too many amendments this
year, and for the sake of the American
people, many of whom are worried that
the President will bumble us into an-
other endless war in the Middle East
that nobody wants.
I look forward to working with the
leader to schedule a time for this very
important debate, a debate mandated
by the Constitution.
BORDER SECURITY
Mr. President, finally, on border,
over the past several weeks, our Nation
has come to grips with the horrendous
treatment of unaccompanied migrant
children at our southern border. The
reports of what is happening at deten-
tion centers like the one in Clint, TX,
and Homestead, FL, have shaken the
conscience of the Nation.
There are hundreds of kids crammed
into a facility suited for a few dozen, at
most, with no beds to sleep on, no soap
or toothbrushes to clean themselves,
and not enough diapers for toddlers to
wear. There are 8-year-olds taking care
of 2-year-olds because they have been
separated from their parents. Many
have worn the same clothes for several
weeks, many have gotten sick, and sev-
eral have died while in the care of our
government.
Yesterday the New York Times re-
leased this picture—a Salvadoran fa-
ther and daughter, Oscar Martinez and
23-month-old Valeria, washed upon the
banks of the Rio Grande after trying to
cross into the United States. Her tiny
head was tucked inside his shirt, her
arm draped around his neck. They were
holding on to each other.
President Trump, I want you to look
at this photo. These are not drug deal-
ers or vagrants or criminals; they are
people simply fleeing a horrible situa-
tion in their home country for a better
life.
How could President Trump look at
this picture and not understand that
these are human beings fleeing vio-
lence and persecution, willing to risk a
perilous, sometimes fatal, journey in
search of a better life? These people are
not coming here to sell drugs or to
commit crimes. They are coming here
to escape brutality, starvation, threats
of rape, and murder in their home
countries. Any normal person would
flee.
The sad fact is, we can do something
about this if the President would stop
playing all the political games of
blame, blame, blame.
If Oscar and Valeria had been allowed
to petition for asylum in the United
States within El Salvador, if they
asked for asylum to come here but did
it at the El Salvadoran Embassy, as
Democrats have proposed, they
wouldn’t have had to make this per-
ilous journey. If the administration
had followed through on foreign aid to
stabilize their home country’s govern-
ment, they would not have had to
make this perilous journey. If our ports
of entry were adequately staffed, if we
had enough asylum judges and our asy-
lum laws were respected, they might
not have perished. That is what is at
stake.
There is a rational solution. It has
had bipartisan support in the past, but
the President only wants not to solve
the problem—he jumps from proposed
solution to proposed solution and then
abandons them, and instead he says:
Let’s blame the Democrats. That is a
disgrace by now.
Mr. President, you are President of
the United States. You are head of the
executive branch. You control what is
happening at the border. Much of what
is happening at the border, President
Trump, stems from the chaos and mis-
management in your administration.
Just yesterday, the Acting Commis-
sioner of Customs and Border Protec-
tion, John Sanders, abruptly resigned
after just a few weeks on the job,
throwing an agency already in turmoil
into another round of chaos. The man
who will replace him, Mark Morgan,
was only installed as Acting Director
of ICE this month. The Department of
Homeland Security still lacks a Sen-
ate-confirmed leader.
I saw a report this morning, based on
reporting in the New Yorker magazine,
that even rank-and-file ICE agents who
are not particularly sympathetic to the
plight of these migrants are fed up
with the chaos in the administration
and the erratic nature—one plan one
week, another plan the next week, an-
other plan the next week, and none of
them implemented. They shouldn’t
have been implemented because they
wouldn’t do the job.
The President’s actions at the border
are a whirlwind of incompetence lead-
ing to pictures like this. We have to
change our policies.
President Trump, if you want to
know the real reason there is chaos at
the border, look in the mirror.
The President continues to blame
Democrats, but the real problem is the
President.
Democrats believe we have a moral
responsibility to act. Right now, we are

June 26, 2019
working to pass a supplemental appro-
priations bill to help improve the con-
ditions for children at the border. The
House passed its version last night. It
is a much better bill than the Senate
version. We should take up the House
bill in the Senate and send something
to the President as soon as possible and
then make sure the administration
uses funds to improve the conditions at
the border immediately. The proposal
that was done by the Senate Appro-
priations Committee, a compromise
bill between Senator SHELBY and
LEAHY, got 30 votes. So there is room
for compromise to get something done.
There was only one dissenting vote.
Once we pass legislation to help solve
the immediate humanitarian crisis at
the border, we should talk about what
else we can do to alleviate the situa-
tion, including allowing folks to apply
for asylum in their home countries, in-
cluding more security assistance to
Central American countries to crack
down on the drug dealers and the vio-
lence and the degradation, including
more judges at the border to reduce the
backlog in cases and reduce the strain
on temporary housing.
We all—Democrats, Republicans, and
Americans—have a responsibility to
act. The Senate, the House, and espe-
cially the President need to act, and
the President needs to end the chaos,
end the fearmongering, and get a grip
on his administration.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the order for the
quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
SASSE). Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
S. 1790
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, it is one of
Congress’s main duties—arguably, its
single most important duty—to provide
for the common defense of our great
country. That sometimes means and
necessarily entails providing addi-
tional funds for unforeseen costs and
emergencies in times of war. Troops
might run out of equipment or muni-
tions or might need to be transported
through war zones, and it is of the ut-
most importance that they have what
they need and that they can get where
they need to go to fight for our country
and to protect us against our most
pressing and dangerous threats.
In the past, Congress provided emer-
gency supplemental funding to take
care of precisely these costs. If it didn’t
appropriate enough to begin with or if
some of these unforeseen costs arose,
perhaps in excess of what Congress had
already planned for, Congress would fill
the gap and would make adjustments
to the following year’s base budget to
account for them. In other words, Con-
gress was doing its job, and it was
doing its job in a thoughtful manner—
one that was fiscally responsible and
one that acknowledged Congress’s con-
stitutional role as a lawmaking body
and the body responsible for funding
war operations and declaring war.
But after the September 11 attacks,
something seemed to change. In 2001,
the Bush administration created a fund
called the Global War on Terrorism ac-
count, sometimes known operatively as
GWOT, separate from the base budget.
From then on, what was once emer-
gency spending for warfighting gaps be-
came a general fund that Congress has
used for military spending and pri-
marily for operations in the Middle
East. Year after year, Congress has an-
ticipated this very type of spending,
and year after year it has failed to in-
tegrate that anticipated spending into
the baseline budget.
When the Obama administration
took over, it changed the name from
GWOT to Overseas Contingency Oper-
ations, or OCO. This is an account that
was newly created in that administra-
tion, but the Obama administration
left the fundamental practice of GWOT
in place. This was GWOT by a different
name.
When the Budget Control Act was
passed in 2011, President Obama re-
quested OCO to be exempted from its
defense spending limits. That practice
has continued to this day, such that
these funds are still exempt from those
limits.
What has been the result of this tra-
jectory? Well, OCO has morphed into
an unaccountable slush fund for the
Pentagon, insulated from scrutiny and
certainly unchecked by budget spend-
ing caps. It is no longer funds that are
provided for unforeseen expenses, and
no one here really pretends otherwise.
Instead, administrations from both
parties have continued to ask for bil-
lions of these dollars each year, com-
pletely outside the budget process, for
what really are predictable, ongoing
activities in the Middle East and else-
where. And Congress has continually
enabled them, perpetuating this bro-
ken, unaccountable system of budg-
eting and spending.
Since 2001, Congress has appropriated
about $2 trillion in total for these
funds, accounting for 17 percent of de-
fense spending during that time period,
with each dollar adding to our rising
and, indeed, staggering debt of $22 tril-
lion. This is not responsible budgeting,
oversight, or governance, and it must
not continue.
In addition to mending this broken,
irresponsible method of financing, it is
far past time that we reassess the oper-
ations toward which this money is
going.
We have now been in Afghanistan for
18 years, and we have now been in Iraq
for 16 years. We have deposed Saddam
Hussein, and we have killed Osama bin
Laden. We have accomplished much of
what we set out to do, but we have also
been pulled into nation building in
countries thousands of miles away,
causing serious harm to those coun-
tries and our own credibility in the
process. Yet these wars drag on and on,
with no end in sight.
Unfortunately, the bill before us, the
National Defense Authorization Act for
fiscal year 2020, maintains the broken
status quo for OCO, authorizing yet an-
other $75 billion—a $7 billion increase
from last year. It perpetuates the mis-
guided strategy we have been under-
taking in the Middle East since the be-
ginning of the wars in Afghanistan and
in Iraq.
It continues funding—in dollars and
weapons and with people—missions
that have no clear end goal for prob-
lems that were never ours in the first
place. For example, it authorizes al-
most $5 billion for the Afghanistan Se-
curity Forces Fund, and it calls for a
stabilization strategy in Iraq, Syria,
Afghanistan, Somalia, Yemen, and
Libya. But in addition to these dubious
nation-building investments that lack
an overall strategy—at least an overall
strategy communicated to the Amer-
ican people that tells them how these
operations will make them safer—there
is still a deeper problem. Congress
never authorized military engagement
in four out of six of these countries to
begin with.
Article I, section 8 of the Constitu-
tion unequivocally states that Con-
gress shall have the power to declare
war—Congress, not the President, not
the Pentagon, and not someone else in
the executive branch, but Congress. Re-
gardless of whether engagement in a
particular country may or may not be
a worthy foreign policy goal, we cannot
escape this point.
The Founders could not have been
clearer. The executive branch must
have authorization from Congress to go
to war. This was understood at the
time of the founding. It was written
into Federalist 69, in which Alexander
Hamilton explained that this is one of
the distinguishing characteristics be-
tween our system and the system from
which we broke away—from London-
based national government headed by a
King, a King who had the authority to
start a war on his own without con-
sulting his Parliament. Our system was
to be different, so they put the power
to declare war in Congress.
Why? Well, because it is the branch
of government most accountable to the
people at the most regular intervals
through elections. They did it this way
and designed it this way precisely be-
cause they understood what is at stake
when we go to war. It is not only our
precious financial resources on the line
but our most precious human re-
sources—the brave men and women
who are willing to lay down their lives
when we go to war.
So they intended these decisions to
be debated and discussed and consid-
ered with utmost deliberation and con-
sideration in front of the American
people by their elected, accountable
representatives.
For these same reasons, it is as much
Congress’s duty to take an active role

in prudently overseeing the operations
that it has authorized and denying
funds to those it has not. Unfortu-
nately, this National Defense Author-
ization Act largely falls short here too.
First, instead of perpetuating these
seemingly indefinite wars, it ought to
actively prepare a strategy to phase
out our engagement in the Middle
East, particularly for authorizations of
force that have lasted for almost 20
years. Second, for any remaining au-
thorizations, it ought to aim for using
our resources and our personnel in a
way that is far more efficient than the
status quo.
Meanwhile, the world has not been
static since we began the war on ter-
ror. Our country is facing new threats.
The national defense strategy laid out
by President Trump and the adminis-
tration does refocus our efforts on
stemming the threats posed by Russia
and China, and this NDAA does reflect
some of that strategy by addressing
some of our most immediate needs to
counter them.
For instance, it reaffirms defense
commitments in the Indo-Pacific and
in the Baltic States, as well as infor-
mation gathering on technical and nu-
clear capabilities that can be found in
both countries. It also prioritizes the
Arctic region, which both Russia and
China are seeking to leverage.
But there are other threats this
NDAA fails to address; namely, our
threats in the Western Hemisphere. In
fact, it lacks a comprehensive defense
strategy or plan for the Western Hemi-
sphere entirely. It is by no means pru-
dent to ignore our neighbors to the
south, especially given the rampant in-
stability throughout the region, in-
cluding that caused by the Maduro re-
gime in Venezuela. Indeed, if we fail to
secure our borders from the immediate
threats we face in the Western Hemi-
sphere, it could become impossible to
truly provide for our Nation’s common
defense.
We ought to reject the status quo and
reject the failures evident in this bill
and the process that brings it to us.
What we should be doing is drawing
down our OCO account and integrating
this spending into the $642.5 billion
baseline defense budget. We should be
having a real debate on whether we
should continue to be entrenched in
the Middle East, and we should be ad-
justing our defense strategy and the
dollars behind that defense strategy to
address the most pressing threats we
face today.
These matters are some of the most
important decisions we will ever be
called upon to make in this body as
Senators, as officers within the legisla-
tive branch of government who are
sworn to uphold, protect, and defend
the Constitution of the United States.
We should take the time to get these
things right. They merit debate over
the course of months, not simply days
or weeks, and they merit not just the
participation of the Armed Services
Committee members but the active
participation and the utmost care and
diligence of all 535 Members of Con-
gress, who themselves have taken an
oath to uphold, protect, and defend the
Constitution of the United States.
It is about time that Congress exer-
cise its most solemn duty of prudently
budgeting and strategizing to protect
the American people. Providing for the
common defense requires nothing less.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas.
H.R. 3401
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, last
night the House of Representatives
passed a funding bill that would pro-
vide $4.5 billion in emergency funding
to Departments and Agencies working
to manage the humanitarian crisis on
the southern border. I would note it
has been 2 months—2 months since
President Trump requested that emer-
gency appropriations bill. In the mean-
time, there have been many who have
talked about the overwhelmed capacity
at the border and the unhygienic condi-
tions in which some of the migrants
were being held, but frankly they seem
to ignore the cause of that problem,
pointing mainly to the symptoms—ac-
tually, symptoms of their own inac-
tion.
If we had simply acted more prompt-
ly, I think many of the problems we
have seen along the border, where fam-
ilies and unaccompanied children are
being detained and processed according
to U.S. law—we could have avoided
that. But, instead, the politics seemed
to overcome good sense here in Wash-
ington once again, and rather than ap-
propriate the money, as the President
requested 2 months ago, to provide the
resources they need in order to deal
with this crisis, it just got worse and
worse.
Of course these terrible pictures of
people that we have seen, which are
really hard to look at, showed the
hardships being borne by some of these
migrants. Indeed, some have lost their
lives. People seem to have forgotten
why people make the dangerous trip
across Central America, across Mexico,
and into the United States, and that is
simply because they are taking advan-
tage of congressional inaction when it
comes to fixing loopholes in our asy-
lum laws, which, if corrected, would
provide an opportunity for people to
claim asylum in a safer, more orderly
way. It would also make sure they
would not have to die in the process of
making that terrible trip from Central
America, across Mexico, and into the
United States.
The House bill number matches our
bill here in the Senate, but the con-
tents of the bills are quite different.
The Speaker of the House has been
working furiously this week to get
Members on board, taking the bill fur-
ther and further to the left with each
revision.
House Democrats have now rammed
through a bill that withholds des-
perately needed funds from detention
centers that are nearly bursting at the
seams and creates overly burdensome
and prohibitive regulations.
The House bill excludes funding for
the Department of Defense as re-
quested by the President, underfunds
the Immigration and Customs Enforce-
ment Agency, and doesn’t provide fund-
ing for new immigration judge teams
to address the significant court back-
log.
Just as an example of how far the bill
goes, there is a section that requires a
specific type of exercise for unaccom-
panied children in custody. That is the
kind of micromanaging that the House
of Representatives has included in
their bill. It is inadequate by any
measure. It ignores the most pressing
funding needs and instead opts for fed-
erally mandated exercise. You literally
can’t make this stuff up.
This isn’t an effort to solve the prob-
lem or the result of conversations that
folks are having with the Agencies that
are crumbling under the weight of this
humanitarian crisis. It is simply a par-
tisan messaging document worth no
more than the paper that it is written
on.
I would add that it stands in stark
contrast to the bipartisan bill we are
considering here in the Senate. It en-
joys broad support. Indeed, it came out
of the Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee 30 to 1. It represents a com-
promise and a good-faith effort to bring
relief to those working to manage the
crisis. Even the Speaker herself de-
scribed the bill to her caucus as a good
bill. So the House has wasted valuable
time passing a bill that stands no
chance of passing in the Senate and the
President has already made clear that
he would veto it if it did.
I hope we will be able to move quick-
ly to pass the bipartisan Senate bill. I
urge our House Members to come to
the negotiating table with reasonable
goals in mind.
Mr. President, I might add in closing
some remarks about the Defense au-
thorization bill, which we will be vot-
ing on today or tomorrow.
This is one of the most important
functions that Congress has to support
our men and women in uniform. If you
look at the list of Federal priorities,
certainly national security and defense
ought to be at the very top. That is
why, for the last 58 years running, Con-
gress has passed a Defense authoriza-
tion bill.
Yet our colleague from New Mexico
has now introduced an extraneous mat-
ter that involves a recent aggressive
contact by Iran and is insisting on a
vote on that. Actually, they want to
delay the vote until Friday when the
Presidential candidates who are run-
ning and debating in Miami tonight
and tomorrow night can get back to
vote. I see no reason for us to delay the
vote on the Defense authorization bill
for those folks who have chosen instead
not to do their job here but rather to
run for President.

June 26, 2019
We have an important job to do here.
I see no reason for the delay. The ma-
jority leader has made it clear that he
is happy to give the Senator from New
Mexico a vote on this authorization for
use of military force, that, frankly, I
don’t believe is necessary, but never-
theless, the majority leader has gener-
ously offered a vote on that. We ought
to be voting on that today or tomorrow
and not unnecessarily delay our work
until Friday just to accommodate the
Presidential candidates.
I would say that the Senator from
New Mexico’s amendment would at-
tempt to put handcuffs on this Presi-
dent unlike any previous President,
and, indeed, I believe it is probably un-
constitutional. It would impair our
ability to respond to further attacks by
Tehran and in a way that would make
them think that we were weak or irres-
olute in responding to their aggression.
The most important thing we can do is
to make clear to the Iranian regime
that their aggression will not be uni-
lateral but that we will meet it with
proportional and devastating response.
No one wants to go to war in Iran, in-
cluding the President of the United
States. I don’t believe Iran actually
wants to go to war, but they are con-
tinuing their 30-year conflict with the
United States, which has cost Amer-
ican lives and American treasury and
now threatens to block the Strait of
Hormuz, which would cause a huge dis-
ruption to the world economy.
I hope we can vote on the National
Defense Authorization Act. I am happy
to vote on the amendment of the Sen-
ator from New Mexico. I do not believe
it will pass, and I do believe it is un-
constitutional if it did. But in order to
get our work done, we need to continue
to vote and vote on the Defense author-
ization bill and the border supple-
mental without further delay.

Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise to
address two very important bills that
are before the Senate this week—the
National Defense Authorization Act
and the border supplemental appropria-
tions bill.
First, on the NDAA, I am pleased
that this bill meets the needs of our
all-volunteer force by providing the
brave men and women with one of the
largest raises in a decade, that of 3.1
percent. With the rising threat of coun-
tries such as China, Russia, and Iran,
this NDAA authorizes funding for cru-
cial defense efforts to make certain
that our military is well prepared and
equipped to defend this Nation from
the threats and challenges we face.
The NDAA substitute actually in-
cludes an amendment I offered, joined
by my Senate Environment and Public
Works chairman, JOHN BARRASSO, of
Wyoming, by Ranking Member CAR-
PER, and by several other bipartisan co-
sponsors. This amendment will for-
mally address the PFAS contamination
about which I have spoken on the floor.
It directly mirrors my legislation, the
PFAS Release Disclosure and Protec-
tion Act, which the committee ap-
proved last week.
PFAS pollution is a nationwide prob-
lem, but its effects are concentrated lo-
cally, often in rural and disadvantaged
communities, especially those near
military installations where large vol-
umes of certain firefighting foams have
been deployed. Significant exposure to
the legacy compounds of PFOA and
PFOS have been linked to rare cancers
and developmental issues.
I got involved with this issue because
it is important but also because two
communities in West Virginia were all
too familiar with the PFAS contamina-
tion and its effects—Parkersburg, WV,
which has endured a history of indus-
trial PFAS contamination, and Mar-
tinsburg, which has been impacted by
the use of firefighting foams.
My amendment will provide cer-
tainty to our citizens that the water
coming out of their taps is safe—in my
opinion, that is really not much to
ask—by requiring that the EPA set a
safe drinking water standard for PFOS
and PFOA within 2 years and that it
look at regulating other types of PFAS
chemicals as the science would merit.
It also provides funding and technical
assistance to ensure that small and
rural water systems can monitor and
address this contamination. That is a
big issue for our rural State. We have a
lot of small water systems, and we
want them to have the same access to
the science but also to the remediation
that large systems have.
My legislation will also improve
transparency by requiring emitters to
report to the EPA the release of any of
one of hundreds of PFAS compounds
into the environment. Sure, we want to
know that. Sure, we do. This informa-
tion is essential for citizens, their local
governments, and Federal agencies to
be able to quickly and adequately re-
spond to this pollution before it per-
vades the water or the soil. I think this
increased accountability will con-
tribute to there being fewer PFAS
emissions in the first place.
Several other bipartisan provisions
will accelerate research into PFAS and
their effects on human health and the
environment. It will ensure collabora-
tion between Federal agencies and mu-
nicipalities in addressing the chal-
lenges posed by contamination, and it
will support the research and develop-
ment into cleaning up these persistent
compounds.
Crucially, this approach is rooted in
science and a formal rulemaking proc-
ess. We have put the Federal Govern-
ment on a shot clock to act to end
agencies’ endless delays in addressing
these challenges without short-
circuiting the regulatory procedures.
Make no mistake—PFAS are essen-
tial to commerce, but some have been
shown to carry substantial risks. This
balanced regulatory strategy should
provide the confidence to Americans
that we are serious about protecting
them from this pollution while also not
upending the economy.
Another important environmental
provision that is included in the NDAA
substitute is the USE IT Act, which I
introduced with Senator WHITEHOUSE,
Ranking Member CARPER, and its lead

sponsor, Chairman BARRASSO. The USE
IT Act follows up on the bipartisan ex-
pansion of the 45Q tax credit for carbon
capture, utilization, and storage, which
was passed last Congress.
CCUS is key to eliminating CO2 emis-
sions while protecting West Virginia’s
coal and natural gas jobs. Trying to
weave that balance is difficult some-
times, but the USE IT Act would pro-
vide CCUS project sponsors with a reg-
ulatory playbook so that they would
know what Federal agencies’ expecta-
tions are at the start of the process.
This is essential for capital-intensive
projects in their drawing private in-
vestment without having the fear of
getting trapped in a regulatory purga-
tory.
Our decades-old environmental stat-
utes never predicted a situation in
which emissions would be captured and
then actually used for an economic
benefit. Carbon provides that oppor-
tunity, but regulatory standards that
do not reflect this new reality, like
New Source Review, sometimes get in
the way. The USE IT Act addresses
these issues, and it will also fund stud-
ies into the pollution reduction bene-
fits of these technologies.
This is the sort of bipartisan and con-
sensus-driven approach that will have a
meaningful impact on emissions while
it will protect jobs and drive innova-
tion in the American economy, and I
am glad that we are taking a signifi-
cant step toward enacting this bill.
I thank Chairman INHOFE and the
Armed Services Committee for their
excellent work on the NDAA. It is im-
portant that we pass this bill this
week.
H.R. 3401
Mr. President, I am also pleased that
the Senate will soon vote to pass bipar-
tisan legislation to provide resources
that will address the humanitarian cri-
sis at our southern border. I am the
chairman of the Homeland Security
Subcommittee on Appropriations, and I
have spoken many times about the
need to pass a supplemental funding
bill.
Last night, the House of Representa-
tives passed its version of the emer-
gency border supplemental.
Actually, to be more accurate, I
would say the Democrats in the House
passed their partisan version of a
Homeland Security bill. I think the
top-line numbers in the House bill may
be similar, but the policy implications
of that bill are vast.
Time is of the essence here. I spoke
about this last week on the floor. Time
is moving quickly to meet this crisis
that everyone agrees is occurring at
our southern border.
The partisan House bill would be ve-
toed by President Trump. What is
needed is not more partisanship; what
is needed is a bill that will become law
so that we can get those resources to
the southern border. That is why I am
encouraged and proud that a bipartisan
compromise was reached in the Senate
Appropriations Committee. We passed
it out of that committee 30 to 1 last
week.
We may not agree on how we got here
or how best to move forward, but we
agree that there is a crisis—a major
crisis—and that these resources are
needed now. The metrics, the images,
and the stories we all see and hear
point to the urgency of this dire situa-
tion, so our committee worked in a se-
rious and bipartisan way, under the
leadership of Chairman SHELBY and
Vice Chairman LEAHY, to address the
pressing issues as they are right now.
We can and we must work toward a
long-term solution to address the im-
migration system, but right now,
today, we all agree that a problem ex-
ists, and our committee has provided a
bipartisan solution, which the leader
just said we will be voting on later this
afternoon. Let us move forward in that
spirit on behalf of the families and the
men and women in law enforcement
who need our support. It is tough down
there. I visited; it is tough.
It is crucial that the Senate pass the
bipartisan border supplemental funding
bill that we passed in the Appropria-
tions Committee last week, and I hope
all of my colleagues will join me in
supporting it today. We have waited
long enough. We can’t afford to wait
any longer.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri.
S. 1790
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to
talk a little bit about a bill we should
pass this week—I believe we will pass
this week—for the 59th straight year.
There are very few things we author-
ize every year—frankly, there are very
few things we need to authorize every
year—but the authorizing bill in de-
fense is the opportunity for the coun-
try and the Congress to look at what
we need to do now that is more appro-
priate than what we needed to do a
year ago to defend the country.
Certainly the men and women who
serve in the military do that job in a
selfless way, and they deserve the best
we can do to be sure they are never in-
volved in an unfair fight. We want to
be sure they are always involved in a
fight in which they have every possible
advantage. They put their lives on the
line to keep us safe, and it is up to us
to be sure they have the equipment,
the training, and the authorization
they need and the authorities they
need to carry out their work.
Every year about this time, we move
toward the authorizing of what the
Congress thinks the military needs.
That is followed later by an appropria-
tions bill that is directed in substantial
ways by what this bill says should hap-
pen. In fact, the only thing the appro-
priations bill normally does is deter-
mine whether it can all be funded and
in what segments it is to be funded.
We are debating this bill. I hope both
Chambers—the House and the Senate—
can pass this authorization bill as we
move on to our next step in this proc-
ess of defending the country.
I think you can argue about almost
anything else the Federal Government
does, but the No. 1 priority of the Fed-
eral Government is to defend the coun-
try—the No. 1 thing that we clearly
cannot do by ourselves; the No. 1 thing
that State and local government can be
a partner in on some occasions, but it
is not their responsibility, and they do
not have the capacity to do what we
need to do to defend the country. So we
are here to take this important step in
that.
This version, the Senate’s version for
this year, authorizes $750 billion to
support the Department of Defense and
the nuclear and other defense respon-
sibilities of the Department of Energy.
Our adversaries are clearly increasing
their military capabilities and their
military commitments, and we need to
be prepared to do just the same.
The burden of defending the country
is an important one, and, frankly, it
falls on a very small percentage of our
population. About one-half of 1 percent
of the American people serve in the
military. We owe an obligation to that
one-half of 1 percent to do our best for
them.
This bill supports an across-the-
board pay increase of 3.1 percent—a lit-
tle more than inflation. It is the larg-
est increase in nearly a decade at a
time when the people who serve see
challenges in more areas than we have
seen in a while and coming from dif-
ferent directions than we have seen in
a while.
This bill reforms military housing.
Leader after leader in the military will
tell us and make the point that the
strength of the military is military
families. So in military housing, par-
ticularly the family housing, there was
thought to be a great idea a couple of
decades ago to privatize family hous-
ing. For a couple of years, it looked
like a great idea, but I think it is time
we look again at our housing obliga-
tions and how they are being met.
We need to look at what we can do to
be sure that the spouses of those serv-
ing have an opportunity, when they are
transferred to a new location, to be
able to get to work as quickly as pos-
sible in the field they are prepared to
work in. In Missouri, in January of this
year, the first spouse of someone who
had been transferred to our State was
sworn in immediately to the bar so she
could immediately begin practicing
law. Like any attorney, there are prob-
ably some future legal training re-
quirements during the course of the
following months. But to be able to go
to work—whether as a medical techni-
cian or a doctor or a lawyer or an elec-
trician or a welder—should be a pri-
ority of the country.
I asked Secretary of the Air Force
Heather Wilson, when she testified be-
fore the committee: What is the best
thing we can do for military families?
I sponsored some legislation a few
years ago so that military families can
move earlier or stay longer for a job,
for work, or for school. That makes a

difference to their families. If you need
to go 2 months earlier than your serv-
ing spouse to get started in the school
year at the right time or if you need to
stay 2 months later or need up to 6
months of transition time, that is
available now. Of course, that is begin-
ning to have an impact on people’s de-
cision to stay in the military, if their
family is considered as a priority and
flexibility is part of that priority.
I asked Secretary Wilson for two
things that we still need improvement
on. One was to be sure to have the best
schools possible near those military
bases, and two was to be sure that
spouses can go to work and that they
can go to work, if they want to go to
work, in the area they are trained for.
So this allows for more effort to be
made, to be sure that we are working
with the Council of State Governments
on a certification program where you
could move to a State and quickly be
doing that. Reciprocal opportunities
for that quick transition is important.
There are changes in this bill that
support families with special needs and
support how you deal with a childcare
provider on a military base, and there
are things here to enhance suicide pre-
vention and family advocacy programs.
These are all critical, not only for peo-
ple serving but for people wanting to
continue to serve.
As I said before, the military family
is one of our Nation’s greatest assets,
and the serving spouse is not the only
one serving. The serving spouse is not
the only one transferred to a new mili-
tary location. The serving spouse is not
the only one who has to be happy with
the commitment to decide that you are
going to go ahead and reenlist, and we
need to be aware of that.
This legislation supports military
construction projects, including the
Army National Guard Readiness Center
in Springfield, MO, where I live; the ve-
hicle maintenance facility at White-
man Air Force Base in our State; and
the C–130 flight simulator facility at
Rosecrans in St. Joe. They are all in-
cluded in this authorization project.
Projects like these are necessary to en-
sure that our military is ready to fight
and also to support their needs when
they are at home.
America’s defense posture includes
what is known as the nuclear triad.
This means that we have three ways we
can deliver a nuclear warhead. We hope
to never have to have that happen. But
if our adversaries have this capacity,
our capacity has to exceed theirs, and
this bill ensures that that continues to
be the case.
The 509th and the 131st Bomb Wings
at Whiteman Air Force Base host one
of the legs of that triad. Earlier this
year, the Air Force announced that
Missouri will host the B–2’s replace-
ment. The principal B–2 location at
Whiteman Air Force Base will host the
B–21 Raider as it becomes available to
replace that plane that has served the
country for so long. I am proud to sup-
port what we need to do to make that
transition.
There are other aircraft that we need
to be sure have a viable part in the
country’s future. The NDAA bill we are
talking about provides an additional 24
F–18 Super Hornets to the Navy and be-
gins the purchase of 8 F–15s for the Air
Force. All those planes are made in St.
Louis.
The bill also includes critical mission
support for the A–10 Warthog, a plane
that our colleague Senator MCSALLY is
pleased to have flown and flown well.
By the way, I had a chance to intro-
duce her the other day, and I almost
ran out of firsts. She was the first
woman to fly in combat and the first
woman to command a combat unit in
combat. She has 356 combat hours that
she herself flew. She is the first person,
of 260 senior military officers, to grad-
uate No. 1 in that advanced training
class.
The Missouri National Guard also
flies the A–10. I have been with them
when they were flying in Eastern Eu-
rope. That A–10 capacity continues to
be critical.
The NDAA authorizes missile pro-
grams between the United States and
Israel, where we have actually learned
that you can target an incoming mis-
sile. Things like the Iron Dome, Arrow
3, David’s Sling, have all—fortunately
for Israel, fortunately for our military
capacity—been proven to work against
incoming missiles. These programs
help Israel defend itself. They also in-
crease our capability to do what they
need to do.
Finally, Senator HAWLEY from Mis-
souri, Senator MANCHIN from West Vir-
ginia, and I have proposed an amend-
ment to the NDAA to make May 1 Sil-
ver Star Service Banner Day. Along
with Senator McCaskill, my colleague
who just left, I have been doing this an-
nually for some time. We think this
would be a great year to make this a
permanent recognition of the Silver
Star families.
I would particularly like to recognize
Diana Lynn Newton, the cofounder of
Silver Star Families of America, who
passed away earlier this year. She and
her husband Steve were the driving
force behind the organization, and they
helped thousands of veterans who were
otherwise getting very little recogni-
tion for their Silver Star service. We
are saddened by that loss. Hopefully,
one of the things we will do in this bill
to recognize her great commitment is
to make the Silver Star recognition
day an annual event.
There are bipartisan priorities here
in this bill that deal with the needs of
the military and their families. The
pay raise is a significant part of this
bill. But being sure that the No. 1 job
of the Federal Government—defending
the country—continues to be recog-
nized as the No. 1 job makes this
unique annual reauthorization of the
Defense bill so important. I look for-
ward to seeing this Congress pass this
bill this week in the Senate and, hope-
fully, soon after that, in both the Sen-
ate and the House.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRAMER). The Senator from Mis-
sissippi.
S. 1790
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I hope
we will vote later on today to advance
the NDAA, the National Defense Au-
thorization Act. Members who have
been around here a long time realize
what a bipartisan tradition this has
been for the Senate. Those listening to
us should appreciate that and I think
take note of basically a half-a-century
tradition of passing this national de-
fense bill on a bipartisan—overwhelm-
ingly bipartisan—basis each year. We
don’t let a year pass. We have been able
to successfully do that for approxi-
mately half a century. We will see later
on today whether that tradition will
continue, and I believe it will.
I think we will be able to work some-
thing out with the House of Represent-
atives. There are some differences that
have emerged over there that we did
not have in the Armed Services Com-
mittee when we reported overwhelm-
ingly just a few weeks ago.
I am very hopeful that we will con-
tinue this tradition. I hope we will do
so particularly this year to build on
the great progress we have made the
last couple of years. I think we should
admit on both sides of the aisle that we
had perhaps let our national security
slip a little in terms of a priority over
the last several years. We rectified that
a couple of years ago. What we have
done not only at the authorization
level but also at the appropriations
level is send a strong signal to our al-
lies around the world that we are back
to emphasizing strength and back to
emphasizing protection of Americans
and American interests but also a sig-
nal to those who would wish us ill.
We know how dangerous the world is
now. I think if any of the 100 of us or
those within the sound of my voice
were asked the question ‘‘Is the world
safer today than it was 2 years ago
when we started on this quest to re-
build our defense?’’ I think the answer
would be no. The world still needs the
strength of the United States of Amer-
ica to keep those trade lines open and
to maintain the peace to which we
have become so accustomed.
We will pass this bill, and then we
will have the task—and I want every-
body to understand this—we will have
the task of getting the bills done to ac-
tually pay for what we authorize. That
is where, quite frankly, I am worried—
with some of the talk I hear around
town about perhaps negotiations going
on between Democrats and Republicans
over here, between House and Senate
Members, and even in the executive
branch—about just not quite getting to
a comprehensive appropriations bill
this year.
Perhaps some people say that we can
save a little money on the margin sim-
ply by having what we call a con-
tinuing resolution—what they call, at
the Pentagon, a CR—to just fund the

government without directives in the
appropriations bill for another year at
the same level that we have, both do-
mestically and militarily. We know
that of that discretionary budget, 50
percent is national security. Every-
thing else in the Federal Government
is called domestic spending, and that is
another 50 percent, approximately.
I am here to tell you that if you ask
the experts who are charged with de-
fending this great United States of
America, they will tell you that a con-
tinuing resolution is not only a mis-
take for the United States of America,
it is a disaster for national defense. We
need to raise this issue and to point
out what the people are saying that we
rely on.
The Pentagon has made progress the
last couple of years. We have com-
mitted to a 355-ship Navy. We are re-
building the Army, Navy, Air Force,
Marines, and the Coast Guard. I can
tell you that a continuing resolution,
according to the experts—the uni-
formed people we put in office to make
us safe—would reverse this progress. It
would stop new programs, it would cur-
tail production ramp-ups, and it would
inhibit the flexibility necessary to
make good resource allocations.
A weeklong CR would be a mistake.
A yearlong CR would be a catastrophe
for the defense of the United States of
America.
With regard to the Navy and Marine
Corps, it would delay heavy mainte-
nance for the Harry S. Truman aircraft
carrier. It would prevent the new guid-
ed missile frigate program from even
starting. We have authorized this. We
have already spent money getting
ready for it. It would prevent the new
guided missile program from begin-
ning. It would cut the planned oper-
ations and maintenance budget by
nearly $6 billion. It would cut O&M
funds that are critical for readiness. It
would prevent 18 critical research and
development efforts from starting, in-
cluding large, unmanned surface vessel
maritime drones and artificial intel-
ligence development. This would be
part of the result of a 1-year con-
tinuing resolution. It would prohibit
funding for 33 critical military con-
struction projects. A 1-year CR or even
a shorter CR would prevent, during its
existence, procurement of one Virginia
class submarine, one fleet ocean tug,
and two landing craft utility vessels to
support our marines during this time
when the world is more dangerous than
it has been in quite a while.
With regard to the Air Force, a 1-
year CR would constrain Air Force
spending at fiscal year 2019 levels, de-
creasing buying power by $11.8 billion.
It would halt 88 new investment pro-
grams. It would delay awarding 40
MILCON projects across 18 States and
limit the planned 4,400 total force end-
strength growth. These are things we
already voted for, but a 1-year CR
would stop them. You can’t do the
extra 4,400 end-strength personnel we
need.
With regard to the Army, it would
negatively impact recent readiness
gains and hamper modernization.
But don’t take my word for it. Every
chance I have gotten at committee
level, we have asked the people in
charge how a CR would affect our abil-
ity to defend the United States of
America.
Here is what Gen. Joe Dunford, the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said earlier this year. And he wasn’t on
some soapbox; he was just answering
questions from a Member of the U.S.
Senate. He said: ‘‘[Past CRs have] de-
layed new starts and it’s been incred-
ibly inefficient in how we prioritize
and allocate resources.’’
Former Secretary of Defense Pat
Shanahan said: ‘‘A Continuing Resolu-
tion would hamstring the Department
. . . we cannot start new initiatives
. . . our funding would be in the wrong
accounts . . . and we would lose buying
power.’’
Is that what we want, rather than do
our jobs, rather than do hard negotia-
tions between Democrats and Repub-
licans and the administration and
agree on a figure for domestic and na-
tional security that we don’t love but
that gets us where we need to be in
terms of defending the country?
Gen. David Goldfein, the top Air
Force four star in the land, said: ‘‘[A]
CR would have a significantly negative
impact.’’ Is that what we want to have
for the Air Force, a significantly nega-
tive impact? He said: ‘‘[I]t would put
our end strength growth at risk be-
cause we would not be able to bring on
the additional Airmen we need.’’
GEN James McConville, Vice Chief of
Staff of the Army, said: ‘‘A continuing
resolution would be devastating to the
United States Army.’’
This is not a politician; this is some-
body who has given his career—given
his professional adult life to being an
officer in the U.S. Army. He said that
a continuing resolution ‘‘would be dev-
astating to the United States Army.’’
Surely the elected representatives in
the House and Senate can heed the
words of these patriots and come to an
agreement.
According to Lt. Gen. David Berger,
Deputy Commandant of the Marine
Corps for Combat Development, ‘‘Pro-
curements are going to be delayed. New
starts you cannot do.’’ These are new
starts that we voted for and are expect-
ing that the Department wants to do. If
we pass a CR, they will not be able to
do a new start.
The worst part about it for us is the
unpredictability.
Jim Geurts, Assistant Secretary of
the Navy for Research, said: ‘‘Budget
uncertainty associated with the con-
tinuing resolution adds instability, in-
efficiency, delays contracting, and
delays fielding of critical capabilities.’’
We need to stifle any talk either in
this building or the Pentagon or down
the street at the other end of Pennsyl-
vania about a 1-year continuing resolu-
tion as being beneficial to the United
States of America. It would have an
impact on every single State that does
military manufacturing.
Those are just a few of the answers
that have been given to us by the pro-
fessionals we put in charge. Let’s give
our team what they need. Let’s pass
this bill this week, send it to the
House, negotiate the differences that
we have at the NDAA level, and patri-
otically do what we have done now for
58 straight years, but then, when we
get back from this Independence Day
break with our patriotic citizens and
our families, let’s get serious about ar-
riving at a compromise number that
gets us where we need to be in terms of
continuing to make sure we have the
resources to protect the United States
of America.
I yield the floor.

BORDER SECURITY
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this ad-
ministration is in crisis when it comes
to border security. John Sanders, the
acting head of U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Protection, resigned yesterday as a
result of the growing scandal and mis-
treatment of migrants, including chil-
dren.
According to the Associated Press
and NBC News reports, almost 300 mi-
grant children have been removed from
a Border Patrol facility in Texas after
media reports of lawyers describing
‘‘appalling’’ and potentially dangerous
conditions, DHS officials told NBC
News. Lawyers who recently visited
two Texas facilities holding migrant
children described seeing young chil-
dren and teenagers not being able to
take showers for days or even weeks,
inadequate food, flu outbreaks, and
prolonged periods of detention. The fa-
cility in question has a capacity of
about 100 people. Yet 300 migrant chil-
dren were there.
The children who were removed were
being held at a border station in Clint,
TX. Some were wearing dirty clothes
covered with mucous and even urine,
said one advocacy organization. Teen-
age mothers wore clothing stained with
breast milk. None of the children had
access to soap or toothpaste, according
to officials at the Immigrants’ Rights
Clinic at Columbia Law School. Some
migrants were sleeping on concrete
benches or even outside at Border Pa-
trol stations. This happened in the
United States of America, not some
Third World nation.
One lawyer representing the immi-
grant children said:
Almost every child I spoke with had not
showered or bathed since they crossed the
border—some of them more than three weeks
ago. There is a stench that emanates from
some of the children because they haven’t
had the opportunity to put on clean clothes
or to take a shower. . . . I have never seen
conditions as appalling as what we witnessed
last week. The children are hungry, dirty
and sick and being detained for long periods
of time. . . . Children who are young them-
selves are being told by guards they must
take care of even younger children. . . .

June 26, 2019
They don’t know where their loved ones are
who they crossed the border with.
According to news reports, the chil-
dren have now been taken to a deten-
tion camp also in El Paso, TX, where
they will remain under the custody of
Border Patrol until they can be placed
with the Department of Health and
Human Services.
This is outrageous and unacceptable
in the United States of America or in
any other country. We can and we must
do better. What is occurring in Texas
may very well be a violation of our
laws.
Federal law generally requires unac-
companied or separated migrant chil-
dren be transferred to HHS within 72
hours, but according to news reports,
some children at the Clint facility had
been in Border Patrol custody for
weeks. That is in violation of Federal
law. Now news reports are saying these
conditions have been replicated in
other border facilities, such as the Cen-
tral Processing Center in McAllen, TX.
Federal law also requires that chil-
dren and families be held in ‘‘safe and
sanitary’’ facilities under the Flores
settlement. The public should be
shocked that administration lawyers
seem to argue that these horrific con-
ditions do not violate the Flores agree-
ment or Federal law. One government
attorney recently argued that specific
amenities, such as soap, toothbrushes,
and even half a night’s sleep, should
not be required under the terms of the
original settlement. The argument
drew criticism from the panel of judges
at the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Ap-
peals.
One panel judge replied during the
argument:
To me it’s more like it’s within
everybody’s common understanding: If you
don’t have a toothbrush, if you don’t have
soap, if you don’t have a blanket, it’s not
safe and sanitary. Wouldn’t everybody agree
to that? Would you agree to that?
I certainly hope every Senator agrees
with that, and I hope every American
does as well.
We have received conflicting media
reports about children being moved
back and forth between different facili-
ties that can only be described as filthy
and not fit for human habitation, par-
ticularly for children. This is not what
America should stand for.
President Trump’s erratic actions on
immigration and border security have
directly contributed to the crisis. Re-
call that President Trump had literally
shut down the entire U.S. Government
in the failed effort to fund an ineffec-
tive border wall. He has threatened to
close down borders entirely. He has cut
off security assistance to the very Cen-
tral American countries that are try-
ing to address the root causes of migra-
tion, which is contributing to the mi-
grant crisis at our southern border.
This is an administration that insti-
tuted a policy of separating children
from their parents at the border. This
is an administration that proposed a
Muslim travel ban. This is an adminis-
tration that is deliberately stoking
fear by now threatening to tear apart
families in the United States with
longstanding ties to the community.
Instead, President Trump should
work with Democrats and Republicans
on comprehensive immigration reform.
He could start by supporting legisla-
tion I cosponsored entitled the Central
America Reform and Enforcement Act.
This legislation would address many of
the root causes of migration and allevi-
ate, not exacerbate, the suffering at
our southern border. This legislation
would provide conditional security as-
sistance to Central American countries
to combat the scourge of drug cartels,
violent gangs, and lawlessness that has
pushed migrants to journey north. It
would enhance monitoring of unaccom-
panied children after they are proc-
essed at the border and would ensure
fair, orderly, and efficient processing of
those who reach our border seeking
protection.
I am pleased that at 2 o’clock today
we will have the opportunity to act.
Last week, the Senate Appropria-
tions Committee approved $4.6 billion
in emergency relief on an overwhelm-
ingly, bipartisan vote—30 to 1.
I am pleased that this legislation will
help better protect vulnerable children
in the custody of the Department of
Health and Human Services. The bill
seeks to improve inhumane conditions
for migrants in the custody of the De-
partment of Homeland Security. The
legislation improves due process pro-
tection for migrants.
The largest portion of this funding
measure, $2.88 billion, goes to the HHS
Office of Refugee Resettlement, which
is in charge of housing unaccompanied
children who are the most vulnerable
group of migrants. This office has ad-
vised Congress that it will run out of
funds in July and has already stopped
making payments for education, legal,
and refugee support services.
The appropriations measure provides
additional funds to assure the safety
and well-being of these children
through social services and case man-
agement to place children in appro-
priate homes, ideally with family
members who are already here in the
United States.
The bill requires ORR facilities that
house children to comply with State-
based licensure requirements, includ-
ing minimum standards of humane
care, oversight and transparency, with
an exception made for influx facilities
in emergencies.
The bill provides $1.3 billion to ad-
dress increasingly inhumane conditions
for migrants apprehended and detained
at DHS facilities. The DHS inspector
general found dangerous overcrowding
at these facilities, leading to sickness
and even death in custody. The meas-
ure provides additional funds for mi-
grant food, clothing, medical, and baby
supplies, as well as funding to non-
profits and local jurisdictions pro-
viding critical social services and shel-
ter to migrants ultimately released
from DHS custody.
The legislation improves due process
for migrants and reduces the court
backlog by nearly doubling the Legal
Orientation Program, which will sig-
nificantly expand the number of mi-
grants who have access to their serv-
ices. The bill provides additional funds
to hire more immigration judge teams
to reduce backlog of pending immigra-
tion cases.
Now let me point out what this legis-
lation does not permit in terms of rein-
ing in some of the worst excesses of
President Trump’s disastrous immigra-
tion policies. The legislation prohibits
funding from going to the President’s
border wall or new detention beds and
prohibits DHS from transferring funds
for any other purpose. It prohibits in-
formation obtained from potential
sponsors of unaccompanied children
from being used in immigration en-
forcement actions.
I am pleased that last night the
House of Representatives passed their
version of the emergency supplemental
appropriations bill by a vote of 230 to
195. The Senate will have an oppor-
tunity to vote on this legislation at 2
o’clock, and I will support it. The
House legislation goes even further
than the Senate legislation in enhanc-
ing protection for migrant children in
government custody.
I urge the Senate to pass the emer-
gency supplemental appropriations leg-
islation later today, which provides
desperately needed assistance to the
most vulnerable migrants, the chil-
dren. Let us take steps to end this hu-
manitarian crisis on our own soil.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order of
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
HEALTHCARE
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, on July
9, the Trump administration will be in
court defending the Texas v. United
States lawsuit. Let me rephrase that.
They will not be defending the lawsuit.
They will be arguing on the side of the
plaintiff in that lawsuit.
This is a virtually unprecedented
move. Administrations traditionally
defend the statutes of the United
States, no matter what they feel about
the politics of the underlying statute.
But the Trump administration has
made the decision to join with 22 Re-
publican attorneys general to argue
that the entirety of the Affordable
Care Act should be dismantled, with
nothing to replace it.
There are those of us who believe
that it would not be wise policy to kick
20 million people off of insurance and
get rid of all of the insurance protec-
tions in the Affordable Care Act, with
no idea as to what comes next. We have
begged our Republican colleagues to
join us in telling the Trump adminis-
tration—demanding that the Trump

administration argue against the at-
torneys general in this case.
I have listened to my Republican
friends, and I have listened to the
President himself over and over again
say that they don’t like the Affordable
Care Act. They want to replace it with
something else, something that insures
more people, and something that con-
tinues to protect people with pre-
existing conditions. If that is your po-
sition, it stands to reason that you
would oppose a lawsuit that seeks to
invalidate the entirety of the Afford-
able Care Act with nothing to replace
it.
The bewitching hour is upon us. The
oral arguments are the week after
next. This lawsuit was successful at
the district court level, so there is no
reason not to believe there is a sub-
stantial possibility that it could be
successful at the appellate court level
as well.
I wanted to come to the floor, as we
head into this week while we will be
back in our districts, just to make sure
that everybody understands what the
stakes are on July 9 when the Trump
administration will argue in court to
get rid of insurance for 20 to 30 million
Americans and what the stakes are for
this Senate—in particular, Senate Re-
publicans refusing to stand up to the
President in his perpetuation of this
lawsuit.
If the Affordable Care Act is struck
down, there are 130 million Americans
with preexisting conditions who could
see insurance rates increase by up to 50
to 60 percent. Others will have their in-
surance withdrawn when they go
through open enrollment next because
no insurer will cover someone with se-
rious, very expensive preexisting condi-
tions. That was the way things worked
before the Affordable Care Act was
passed.
Gone is Medicaid expansion, which
today covers 17 million people across
the country—and I have been happy to
see more and more States with Repub-
lican Governors or Republican State
legislators adopt the Medicaid expan-
sions and become a source of bipartisan
agreement that more people should
have access to Medicaid—but those 17
million people will lose their coverage.
There are 12 million seniors who will
immediately pay more for prescription
drugs because the Affordable Care Act
gets rid of, over time, essentially the
entirety of the Medicare part D dough-
nut hole.
There are 2.3 million adult children
who are on their parents’ insurance
until they become 26, who would poten-
tially lose access to that insurance.
The Affordable Care Act requires insur-
ance companies to cover those kids.
Many insurers, without that require-
ment, would no longer cover those chil-
dren.
Then many of the other protections
in the marketplace, like bans on life-
time caps or annual caps, can be lost.
Insurers would once again be back in
the practice of saying to a very sick
child, a patient with cancer: You only
get x amount of insurance coverage
from us, and once you go beyond that
number, then it is on your dime.
Again, remember, before the Afford-
able Care Act was passed, there were
1.5 million families every single year in
this country who declared bankruptcy.
Today, there are half as many families
who declare bankruptcy in this coun-
try. It is not coincidence that studies
have shown us that of those 1.5 million,
half of them were declaring bankruptcy
because of medical costs. When you
don’t go bankrupt any longer because
of medical costs because you have ac-
cess to affordable insurance and your
insurance company can’t kick you off
because you get sick, you don’t face
the kind of destitution that families
faced before.
So I think it does make sense to run
through the lineup of who has weighed
in in favor of this court case to invali-
date the entirety of the Affordable
Care Act and knock 20 to 30 million
people off of insurance to jack up rates
for millions more and who has weighed
in against it.
Well, the President wants this law-
suit to succeed. Attorneys general
want this lawsuit to succeed. And by
the silence of my Republican col-
leagues, you would infer that many Re-
publicans may want this lawsuit to
succeed.
But here is who hates this lawsuit. I
am not going to run through the whole
list here, but this is essentially any-
body who knows anything about
healthcare. This is essentially every
organization that represents people
who have serious diseases, every asso-
ciation that represents doctors, and
every association that represents hos-
pitals. You don’t really find all of those
groups aligned on much at all because
when you are moving around pieces in
the healthcare system, often you will
do something that benefits patients
that insurers will not like or you ben-
efit something at hospitals that single-
practice offices will not like. This is
pretty much everybody who says: If
you kick 20 million people off insur-
ance like that and you have no plan to
replace it, that is a humanitarian ca-
tastrophe.
Here is what the AARP says in their
filing opposing this lawsuit:
If this Court finds that the ACA is invalid,
millions of older adults will lose the
healthcare coverage and consumer protec-
tions they have relied on for years. They will
also throw the Medicare and Medicaid pro-
grams into fiscal and administrative chaos,
which will disrupt the nation’s healthcare
system and economy. It will plunge the more
than 100 million people with preexisting con-
ditions into an abyss of uncertainty about
whether they can obtain coverage.
That is the AARP.
Here is what the American Medical
Association says: ‘‘The decision below,
if affirmed, would have devastating ef-
fects on the quality, cost, and avail-
ability of such care.’’
Families USA says: ‘‘Among those
whose coverage rates increased due to
Medicaid expansion are young adults,
people with HIV, veterans, rural resi-
dents, and racial and ethnic minori-
ties.’’
For many of our most vulnerable
citizens who are covered by Medicaid,
eliminating the expansion would leave
them without healthcare.
I mentioned the insurance companies
are against this lawsuit. They say this:
‘‘Invalidation of the ACA—irrespective
of the continued operation of the so-
called individual mandate—would
wreak havoc on the healthcare sys-
tem.’’
Finally, Americans with disabilities
say:
The result is a cruel irony: the population
that needs healthcare the most has the hard-
est time obtaining it. For the last nine
years, the ACA has helped change that.
Stripping away its protections now will re-
verse the positive gains that people with dis-
abilities have realized and will return this
community to the same grim reality as be-
fore the ACA, if not place people with dis-
abilities in an even worse position.
So let’s not forget where we were be-
fore the Affordable Care Act was
passed. I am not saying that it is per-
fect. I am not saying that we shouldn’t
work together to try to improve it. We
just finished a debate in the Health
Committee in which we passed a whole
bunch of reforms to our healthcare sys-
tem that Republicans and Democrats
agree on.
But the American Cancer Society, in
their filing, reminds the court: ‘‘A 2009
Harvard Medical School study found
approximately 45,000 deaths annually
could be attributed to lack of health
insurance among working-age Ameri-
cans.’’
The Heart Association said this:
‘‘Even during a heart attack, uninsured
patients were more likely to delay
seeking medical care because of the fi-
nancial implications.’’
I could go on and on, reading from
these filings or reading from the testi-
mony that all of these groups have sub-
mitted. Again, that is not to say that
these groups don’t want changes in our
healthcare system. Nobody on this list,
as far as I know, is arguing for the sta-
tus quo, just as no one in this body is
arguing for the status quo. But to rip
away Medicaid expansion, to rip out
from the roots of the healthcare sys-
tem the exchanges and the tax credits,
to get rid of all of the insurance protec-
tions, to reverse the gains we have
made on lowering prescription drug
costs for seniors—to do all of that with
nothing to replace it is to invite mis-
ery, destitution, and chaos.
Let’s just be honest. We are not
ready to ride to the rescue. I offered an
amendment in the Health Committee
today just asking for the Department
of Health and Human Services to pro-
vide us with a report about what the
landscape would look like in the
healthcare system if Texas v. United
States were successful. I didn’t get a
single Republican vote for that one. All
I was asking was that we just get a re-
port on how bad it is going to be so

that we can start doing a little bit of
advance planning, and not a single Re-
publican was willing to vote for that in
committee today.
So we are deliberately boxing our
eyes and ears about what the effects on
our constituents could be if this law-
suit is successful. We are not in a posi-
tion to ride to the rescue. There is no
chance that this Congress is going to
pass a new healthcare reform proposal
that will restore healthcare to every-
body who lost it. That is not hap-
pening, and I know that is not a sur-
prise to anyone here.
You also shouldn’t delude yourself
into thinking this lawsuit will not be
successful. There are lots of very smart
legal scholars who suggest that this ar-
gument that the plaintiffs are making,
which the Trump administration has
endorsed, is nonsense. I tend to agree
with them. The argument is that be-
cause you got rid of one section of the
Affordable Care Act, then the court
needs to invalidate the rest.
Well, Congress made its intent pretty
clear. Republicans decided to get rid of
the individual mandate for the penalty
that is assessed if you don’t have insur-
ance and deliberately did not choose to
get rid of the rest of it. I think that is
not a smart decision, but the intent of
Congress is pretty clear.
It is my belief that this argument
doesn’t hold water, and that is the be-
lief of many smart legal scholars, but
the district court ruled in favor of the
plaintiffs. So you already have a Fed-
eral judge who invalidated the entire
Affordable Care Act.
Since then, the Trump administra-
tion has upped the ante. The district
court finding in favor of the plaintiffs,
which invalidates the entire Affordable
Care Act, didn’t convince the President
to say: Let’s pull back the reins a little
bit here. Let’s maybe change our posi-
tion. This feels too real. Let’s hedge
our bets. No; after the district court
ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, the ad-
ministration changed their position to
go all in on the plaintiffs’ side. Their
initial lawsuit only backed up some of
the plaintiffs’ claims.
So the district court ruled that the
Affordable Care Act has to disappear
overnight. The Trump administration
has changed their position to weigh in
and to support the entirety of the law-
suit, and we are not having a serious
conversation about what happens if the
fate that all of these groups are deeply
fearful of comes to pass.
Finally, this is not about numbers.
This isn’t about statistics. This is
about real people. Michael from New
Fairfield, CT, says:
This is . . . personal to me, the ACA lit-
erally saved my life in 2016. I have pre-exist-
ing, recurrent skull base disease for most of
my adult life. I underwent an 11-hour skull
base neurosurgery to remove a benign tumor
that involved my brain arteries, nasal pas-
sages, jaw and a total reconstruction of my
middle and outer ear canals. My surgeon said
I was a month away from a much more de-
bilitating surgical outcome. As it is, my re-
covery and rehabilitation period has been a
full two years with resulting partial physical
impairment.
My spouse and I both run our own busi-
nesses and the ACA is still our family’s only
option for healthcare. Without the oper-
ations and the ACA coverage, the disease
would have continued to progress—I would
have eventually died and my family would
have had to sell the house and/or go bank-
rupt to manage the medical expenses.
David from Southport said:
In July of 2011 I was diagnosed with Colon
Cancer. At the time, I was covered under an
individual policy with Blue Cross Blue
Shield. It was a very comprehensive policy
and, after my deductible was satisfied, it
covered all my doctor and hospital expenses,
surgeries, chemotherapy, medications, etc.
However, a couple of years later I was ad-
vised that due to my preexisting condition I
would not be able to renew my policy. . . .
At that time I enrolled in [the Affordable
Care Act] Access Health CT and without this
policy . . . [through Access Health CT] I
would not be able to be insured and would
face prohibitive costs for even basic care.
David’s story can be told thousands
of times over: a diagnosis followed by
denial of coverage from an insurance
company because of a preexisting con-
dition.
There is no free market response
when it comes to very sick people who
want insurance. The free market tells
the insurance company: Do not insure
somebody who is going to cost you a
lot of money. The free market would
tell the insurance company to keep
that person on the outside of insur-
ance. So there has to be a public sector
response. We provided that response
with the Affordable Care Act and now,
in a matter of weeks or months, it
could all be gone.
So I come down to the floor this
afternoon to once again engage my col-
leagues and ask them to work to-
gether. Let’s try to find a common
ground here, at least behind the
premise that you shouldn’t rip out the
foundation of the modern healthcare
system without a plan for what comes
next.
I assume we will continue to offer
unanimous consent requests to try to
withhold funding for the Trump admin-
istration’s perpetuation of this lawsuit.
I would hope we can get Republican
support for that motion, not because
Republicans support the Affordable
Care Act—I get it; I am not going to
get Republicans to support the Afford-
able Care Act—but because my Repub-
lican friends need to make good on
what they have said for years; that
they want the Affordable Care Act to
go, but they really want something
else to replace it that will insure the
same number of people and protect
folks who are sick. That cannot happen
if this lawsuit succeeds.
As we head back to our districts for
this recess period, I wanted to make
sure everybody knows how many
groups that know something or any-
thing about healthcare are standing
against Texas v. The United States.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming.
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I am
here to address the specific topic about
energy laws, but hearing my friend and
colleague from Connecticut talk about
the healthcare law, I would just point
out that as 20 Democratic candidates
for President assemble tonight and to-
morrow night in Miami, they are going
to be there calling for a repeal and re-
placement of the Obama healthcare
law.
The leading candidate, the Senator
from Vermont, is going to say, under
this healthcare law that we have now
in this country, this healthcare system
is the most bureaucratic, inefficient
system in the world, and he is going to
propose a one-size-fits-all healthcare
system that repeals and replaces the
ObamaCare healthcare law with a sys-
tem where people will pay more to wait
longer for worse care. As a result, 180
million people who get their insurance
through their jobs will lose their insur-
ance. Also, as a result, the 20 million
Americans who are on Medicare Advan-
tage will lose that coverage as well.
ENERGY POLICY
Mr. President, I come to the floor
today to discuss my continued efforts
to modernize our Nation’s energy laws.
Since my arrival in 2007 in the Sen-
ate, I have worked in the Senate on
pro-growth energy policies. My goal
has always been to protect workers, to
promote American energy, and to pro-
vide for innovation.
The Presiding Officer is from an en-
ergy State. He knows that today the
United States is the world’s top energy
producer. We are the global leaders in
oil as well as natural gas. Still, the en-
ergy sector is evolving at a fast clip.
We need to stay ahead of the curve to
stay on top, so our laws should reflect
this changing reality.
The key, of course, is innovation.
That is why I am constantly talking
with folks in the industry, people back
home in Wyoming, and taking the
pulse. I listen to the workers in coal
mines and oilfields of Campbell Coun-
ty, to the researchers at the labs at the
University of Wyoming. What we dis-
cuss are best practices and issues such
as: How can we streamline energy per-
mitting? How can we speed research?
How can we ensure safety and protect
the environment?
My point is, we need to know the sit-
uation on the ground. I know the Pre-
siding Officer hears that in North Da-
kota on a regular basis. That is how we
need to make sure energy laws make
sense—knowing what is happening on
the ground.
I proposed practical reforms that re-
flect that reality. I recently offered
legislation to modernize the Federal
electricity law. It is called the UP-
DATE PURPA Act. PURPA refers to
the 1978 Public Utility Regulatory Pol-
icy Act. Senators Risch, Cramer, and
Daines are original cosponsors of this
UPDATE PURPA law. Principally, we
want to protect families from inflated
electric bills.
People in Wyoming and North Da-
kota and other States are overpaying.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4538 June 26, 2019
That is because PURPA requires State
utilities to purchase renewable power
and then pay above-market rates to do
it. They have to buy it even when their
customers do not need it, and that is
the problem.
Forty years after that law was passed
in 1978—fast forward, here we are 41
years later, and clearly it has outlived
its purpose. The law’s original intent
was to diversify power sources, and it
certainly succeeded. Wind and solar
power now provide about 9 percent of
the electricity in this country—9 per-
cent wind and solar.
The fact is, renewable power tech-
nology has improved rapidly so we no
longer need to micromanage these pur-
chases. Consumers should not continue
to overpay for electricity due to out-
dated rules, regulations, and laws. UP-
DATE PURPA would solve this prob-
lem. It protects utility customers from
added costs; it frees State utilities
from unnecessary mandates to buy
power; and it helps develop all energy
sources, including renewable energy.
I am also working to pass a bill
called the USE IT Act. It stands for
Utilizing Significant Emissions with
Innovative Technologies. This bipar-
tisan bill would help researchers find
uses for captured carbon dioxide emis-
sions.
The research is already happening in
Wyoming. It is taking place outside
Gillette in the Integrated Test Center.
The USE IT Act will further this effort.
It will apply our Nation’s brightest
minds to take carbon from the air, to
capture it from the air, to trap it, and
to transform it into valuable products.
Captured carbon can be used to ex-
tract oil from wells that otherwise
would not be profitable. It can also be
used to make building materials and
carbon fiber. It can be used for medical
purposes.
In addition, I am working to promote
nuclear energy. Nuclear power is safe,
reliable, and carbon-free. Today it pro-
vides 60 percent of America’s carbon-
free electricity. It is by far our largest
carbon-free source, and it is doubling
the wind and solar in terms of the total
that we get from wind and solar. We
have already made progress on ad-
vanced nuclear technology because ear-
lier this year we passed a bipartisan
nuclear bill called the Nuclear Energy
Innovation and Modernization Act, and
that became law—signed into law.
This bill, now law, will ensure that
we remain a leader in nuclear innova-
tion. It will simplify the process for li-
censing and developing advanced reac-
tors. This progress will help increase
our use of carbon-free energy. We need
all the energy. We need the renewable
energy. We need the nuclear energy.
We need the oil, gas, and coal. We need
all of it, and we must address our nu-
clear waste problem.
That is why I fought to complete the
licensing of the storage facility at
Yucca Mountain. I recently chaired a
committee hearing on this draft pro-
posal.
As I wrote in the Wall Street Jour-
nal, ‘‘The lack of progress on Yucca
Mountain has become a roadblock for
nuclear power in America.’’
Both parties want Americans to use
more carbon-free energy, so both par-
ties should embrace sensible, scientific
solutions.
Another energy issue I am addressing
is reform in the process that we use to
get permits to get permission to ex-
plore for energy, to use our resources.
Earlier this year, I introduced a bill
called the ONSHORE Act. It stands for
Opportunities for the Nation and
States to Harness Onshore Resources
for Energy.
We have a very talented staff that
comes up with these creative names. It
is onshore energy—Opportunities for
Nations and States to Harness Re-
sources for Energy. The ONSHORE Act
will simplify the Federal onshore oil
and gas permitting process. So whether
we are talking about oil and gas per-
mitting or utilities or carbon capture
or nuclear power, we must engineer our
way to American energy solutions.
Commonsense reforms will help the
United States stay on top and stay safe
at the same time.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont.
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last
week, Democrats and Republicans on
the Senate Appropriations Committee
came together and we approved by a
vote of 30 to 1 an emergency supple-
mental to address the most urgent hu-
manitarian needs at our southern bor-
der. Some would say that the way the
Senate has been led lately, you
couldn’t get a 30-to-1 vote to say the
Sun rises in the east.
The bill reflects weeks of good-faith
negotiations between Republicans and
Democrats to forge a bipartisan agree-
ment to mitigate what has been an es-
calating humanitarian crisis—one
where infants and toddlers are sleeping
on cold cement floors in wire cages and
under bridges. Inaction is simply not
an option for those who care about al-
leviating the suffering of desperate
children and families seeking refuge in
the United States.
Action in the Senate requires com-
promise. That is the reality in a body
where 60 votes are required to move a
bill forward. No one, Republican or
Democrat, is going to get everything
they want—including me, and I am the
vice chairman of the Appropriations
Committee—but that is the nature of
compromise. One thing I am not will-
ing to compromise on is our American
values, and this bill reflects that.
The Senate supplemental protects
unaccompanied children, some of our
most vulnerable migrants, by securing
funds for their safety and their well-
being in HHS custody. It includes $109
million to ensure the safety and well-
being of those children through post-
release wraparound services, legal serv-
ices, and case management to get chil-
dren out of cages and put them in lov-
ing homes. It puts restrictions on the
use of influx facilities. It establishes
standards of care to ensure that chil-
dren are kept in safe, sanitary facili-
ties where they are properly cared for—
not cages.
Our bill will mitigate inhumane con-
ditions faced by migrant families in
DHS custody by providing funds to im-
prove conditions in grossly over-
crowded facilities and buy food, cloth-
ing, and medical services for the people
in our care. It provides money to en-
sure that we have diapers, formula,
baby wipes, and other essential sup-
plies for infants and toddlers.
Like the rest of the country, I read in
horror the reports from a border facil-
ity in Clint, TX, where the children
were unbathed, where sickness was
spreading, and where infants were
being cared for by other young children
in custody barely old enough to care
for themselves. No child, no matter
where they are from, deserves to live in
such conditions.
Our bill improves due process for mi-
grants by expanding access to legal
services and our immigration courts. It
provides grants to nonprofit organiza-
tions and local jurisdictions that pro-
vide critical services in shelters to mi-
grants released from DHS custody. Bol-
stering border security and treating
migrants with humanity are not mutu-
ally exclusive goals. Indeed, accom-
plishing both together is the American
way. We are America. We can do two
things at once.
Apparently, President Trump never
got the memo about our American val-
ues. Since the day he took office, he
has demonized and vilified immigrants,
asylum seekers, and refugees at every
opportunity. Through false and inflam-
matory tweets and cruel policies, he
has worked to instill widespread fear
among immigrant communities, tar-
geting asylum seekers as if they were
hardened violent criminals.
In just this past week, he threatened
widespread arrests of thousands of im-
migrant families, seemingly without
concern for the many families that
would be torn apart and the separated
children who happen to be American
citizens who would be left behind. Now
he has backed away from that threat
temporarily, but he has promised to re-
visit it.
Just last week, the Trump adminis-
tration went to Federal court to argue
that it should not be required to give
detained migrant children tooth-
brushes and toothpaste, soap, towels,
showers, or proper sleeping conditions
when in U.S. custody—that such amen-
ities are not part of the definition of
‘‘safe and sanitary’’ conditions.
What would we say if another coun-
try were holding Americans like that?
It has become painfully obvious:
President Trump views immigrant
families, asylum seekers, and refugees
not as human beings but as political
ammunition intended solely to rile his
base. When asked about the horrendous
conditions at DHS and ORR facilities

and the separation of families, he said
it is not true and he repeated his
threat of mass deportations—even
though many of us here in the Congress
in both parties have seen it. He is ei-
ther willfully ignorant about what has
been widely documented or he has no
qualms about lying about it.
Not a single one of the President’s
anti-immigrant, fearmongering tactics
would address the very real humani-
tarian crisis overwhelming our south-
ern border. This is exactly why the bi-
partisan Senate supplemental does not
provide a single dollar for President
Trump’s request for hundreds of mil-
lions in additional dollars for the in-
carceration of immigrants in ICE fa-
cilities.
It is why we did not provide any of
his requested funds to pursue mis-
guided policies like ‘‘Remain in Mex-
ico,’’ which law enforcement officials
have stated actually encourages, not
discourages, illegal crossings. It is
why, in a bipartisan way, we included a
strict prohibition on the transfer of
supplemental funds for any purposes
other than addressing the humani-
tarian crisis at the border. And finally,
it is why we refused to include any of
the deeply harmful, unprecedented
changes to our immigration and asy-
lum laws that the President has advo-
cated for.
I am under no illusion that this sup-
plemental bill will address all of the
problems with our immigration sys-
tem—far from it. It is a temporary so-
lution to address some of the most ur-
gent issues. We need to have a broader
debate about comprehensively address-
ing those problems, just as we did
years ago.
Years ago, a bipartisan group of Sen-
ators put forward a thoughtful, bipar-
tisan immigration bill. As chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee, I
held three hearings on the bill. We had
five days of markups. We considered 212
amendments, 141 of which were adopt-
ed, including nearly 50 from Repub-
licans. And then 68 Senators supported
the legislation on the floor.
Unfortunately, the Republican
Speaker of the House would not bring
up the bill, even though it would have
passed overwhelmingly, because he
thought it might violate the Dennis
Hastert rule. I think, if we were to
have that same process here again
today, I would bet we would also have
68 Senators—Republicans and Demo-
crats—vote for it.
Yet this is a conversation and a de-
bate we will have to have on another
day. I will be happy to work with those
Republican and Democratic Senators
who worked together to get an immi-
gration bill before, but we are not
going to do it in the context of an
emergency supplemental, which is
meant to address the most urgent hu-
manitarian needs at the border. It is
why Senator SHELBY and I and others—
Republicans and Democrats—have
worked for weeks, quietly behind the
scenes, in order to put this together
and get our 31 votes. It is because we
know we have to first act to provide
safe, humane care for the migrant chil-
dren and families who seek mercy and
safety.
It was yesterday that the House
passed its own version of an emergency
supplemental for the southern border.
It is also a very good bill, and it goes
further in offering protections to im-
migrants in our care than we are able
to do in this Chamber, because there
have been objections from the Repub-
lican side of the aisle. It provides im-
portant additional protections for chil-
dren who are under the care of the Of-
fice of Refugee Resettlement and for
those being held at CBP processing fa-
cilities, and I support that. We should
be taking care of the children in our
custody as if they were our own. Tak-
ing care of children is not a partisan
issue. We should all agree on that.
I am also pleased that the House bill
includes a provision to protect the
funding that Republicans and Demo-
crats have already appropriated to ad-
dress the causes of migration in Cen-
tral America. I am upset the President
has threatened to take that money and
reprogram it elsewhere.
We were not able to reach agreement
on that issue in the Senate, but in a
few moments, we will have an oppor-
tunity to vote on the House bill. I hope
Members on both sides of the aisle will
be able to support it.
Neither the House nor the Senate bill
has any funding for additional ICE de-
tention beds. This is no mistake. The
President’s predisposition to turn to
mass detention above all else is cruel,
irresponsible, and also a horrible waste
of taxpayers’ money. There are alter-
natives to detention that exist that are
safe and less expensive.
The administration needs to use the
resources it has for ICE detention serv-
ices to house those people who truly
present a danger to our communities
and not lock up every man, woman,
and child simply for being here. Lock
up those who really do present a dan-
ger. Most 5-year-old children do not. It
makes no sense to lump them all in to-
gether. We carefully negotiated ICE’s
bed levels in the fiscal year 2019 Home-
land Security Appropriations bill just a
few months ago, which was passed by
both Republicans and Democrats, and
there is no reason to revisit it now.
We have heard that the administra-
tion plans to set up a request to fund
more ICE detention beds through re-
programming the money that we need.
I urge my Republican colleagues to
join me in opposing any such request.
The administration should not do ad-
ministratively what both Republicans
and Democrats have rejected.
Unfortunately, this is a pattern with
this administration. It just wants to
ignore bipartisan majorities in the
House and Senate. It ignores the will of
Congress. It uses loopholes and ignores
traditional norms in the appropriations
process. It uses suspect readings of the
law to accomplish its agenda. When
Congress rejected the administration’s
request, it acted as though it was
above the law, above the Constitution.
Nobody is above the law in this coun-
try. None of us in the Senate are, and
neither is the President of the United
States.
Let’s not forget the President’s dec-
laration of a national emergency to
fund his wall when Congress debated it
and refused to provide him the money
he had requested. We have to stand up
for ourselves as an institution. I urge
my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle to join me—not as Democrats or
Republicans but as U.S. Senators—in
saying no to this President when he
blatantly ignores the will of the Con-
gress.
I thank Chairman SHELBY for work-
ing with me on this bipartisan humani-
tarian assistance bill.
We need to work quickly to resolve
the differences between the House and
the Senate bills so we can get a bill to
the President’s desk. I hope President
Trump will have the good sense to sign
the supplemental bill into law. Then
let’s turn to the much needed debate
on comprehensive immigration reform.
We showed we could do it when I was
the chairman of the Judiciary. We
showed we could get a 2-to-1 vote in
this body. Let’s do it again.
Of course, I urge Members to oppose
the Paul amendment.
Four months ago, Republicans and
Democrats came together and appro-
priated funds in the State and Foreign
Operations Act that would help
counter terrorism and human traf-
ficking, promote democracy, combat
poverty, provide humanitarian aid, and
support global health programs. A bi-
partisan majority of Congress sup-
ported this funding and the President
signed it into law. The Paul amend-
ment proposes to rescind $4.6 billion,
clawing back programs with a wide
range of consequences.
Counterterrorism programs would be
cut. These funds support programs that
target vulnerable youth to prevent
radicalization. These programs provide
governments with the tools to counter
the influence of violent extremist orga-
nizations, including by countering ter-
rorism financing.
Programs to combat human traf-
ficking would be cut by the Paul
amendment. These programs support
nongovernmental organizations that
promote stronger government policies
and programs to combat human slav-
ery and trafficking. They help hold per-
petrators accountable and support gov-
ernments that are combatting human
trafficking, and they help to protect
victims of trafficking.
Programs that strengthen civil soci-
ety, independent media, and promote
democracy in Venezuela, Iran, Cuba,
Hungary, Egypt, and many other coun-
tries would be cut. These funds support
efforts to hold governments account-
able for repression, promote freedom of
expression and religious freedom, and
provide services to victims of persecu-
tion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4540 June 26, 2019
The Paul amendment would claw
back humanitarian aid. There are more
people forcibly displaced in the world
today than at any time since World
War II. It is a global humanitarian cri-
sis that is contributing to instability
and insecurity, including in our own
hemisphere. The amendment would re-
scind funding for U.S. refugee aid and
aid to victims of famine, earthquakes,
and other natural disasters.
And funding for PEPFAR, programs
to combat malaria and TB, and other
global health programs would be cut by
the Paul Amendment. This includes
programs to respond to deadly
pandemics like Ebola.
There are countless other examples,
since the Paul amendment uses a meat
cleaver approach to demolish most of
our international development and hu-
manitarian programs that reduce pov-
erty, respond to crises, build free mar-
kets, and strengthen democratic insti-
tutions.
Why are there unobligated balances
in these programs? These funds were
appropriated only 4 months ago and are
available for obligation through the
next fiscal year for multiyear projects.
That is how foreign assistance works.
In the last two foreign aid appropria-
tions laws, Senator GRAHAM and I in-
cluded targeted rescissions of funds
that could no longer be spent effec-
tively, or that were about to expire.
That is the responsible approach, and
one that preserves the integrity of the
appropriations process. That is not the
approach in this amendment.
I urge members to vote no on this
amendment and pass the bipartisan bill
reported by the committee 30 to 1 so
that we can sit down with the House
tonight to work out the differences
with the House bill.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky.
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, today we
will consider funding to address the hu-
manitarian crisis on the border. The
spending bill will be $4 billion. While
there is a humanitarian crisis at the
border, we also have in our country a
debt crisis. We are adding debt at about
$1 trillion every year. The overall debt
is $22 trillion, and the interest on the
debt that we have to pay every year is
exploding such that it is crowding out
other spending.
While I do agree that there is a hu-
manitarian crisis at the border, we
must not ignore the debt crisis that
faces our country. We should not bor-
row the money and pull out the credit
card, yet again, every time a crisis oc-
curs. Congress has an obligation to find
lower priorities to cut to pay for higher
priorities. I thought that is what legis-
lating was about. You are supposed to
say that right now we have a crisis at
the border. So maybe we are not going
to send welfare to foreign countries.
Every American family has to make
these decisions. Why doesn’t Congress?
What Congress does is simply add it to
the bill your kids and your grandkids
will be paying.
I am proposing to actually pay for
this by taking the money from a part
of the budget that is being wasted and
put it into the humanitarian crisis on
the border. Should we provide care and
shelter to immigrants at the border or
should we be paying for clown shows
and a traveling circus? Should we pro-
vide food for the children that remain
at the border or should we pay to sup-
port the businesses of deported immi-
grants?
Listen carefully. When we catch peo-
ple coming across the border illegally,
we send them back to the country and
say: Don’t worry. We will send you
money to help you start a business.
They break our law, and we give
them money to start a business back in
their home country. If you ask politi-
cians here, the answer is: Fund it all.
Just put it on the credit card. We will
just keep borrowing. Your kids and
grandkids will pay for it.
I mentioned some of these examples
that I would cut, but let’s hear about
some more. Where is your money
going? Where is the money coming
from so that we could actually pay for
this crisis at the border? My amend-
ment rescinds the remainder of this
year’s funds for the Inter-American
Foundation. You may not have heard
of this, but last time this bill was au-
thorized was in 1985. For over 24 years,
we haven’t done anything. We haven’t
even looked at the program. We just
keep feeding it money.
What do they fund in the Inter-Amer-
ican Foundation? Let’s see. They spend
money to support small businesses of
deported immigrants. One time we
asked them: Do you at least exclude
criminal deportees? They had a blank
look on their face, and they didn’t have
an answer. They aren’t excluding peo-
ple we deport because they have com-
mitted a crime in our country from re-
ceiving American welfare.
This group spent $1.2 million helping
people in Mexico, Guatemala, and El
Salvador to improve their ‘‘spending
strategies.’’ Does that sound like a
good use of money? If we need money
at the border, let’s quit sending it
south of the border to improve the
spending habits of those in Mexico,
Guatemala, and El Salvador.
These funds also subsidized guinea
pig farmers in Peru, a llama fair in Bo-
livia, and advertisements to buy car-
bon credits in Mexico. If we have a cri-
sis at the border—both sides of the
aisle have now finally woken up to
there being a crisis—let’s spend it on
the crisis and not be supporting a
llama fair in Bolivia or a guinea pig
farm in Peru.
This same group that I would like to
take the money from to spend it on the
border spent half a million dollars to
‘‘jump start’’ the Haitian film indus-
try. Does that sound like a national
priority to anybody? If we want to
treat people in a more humanitarian
fashion on the border and we need to
spend some money down there, maybe
we could not be supporting the Haitian
film community.
This group spent $300,000 to help Bra-
zilians get off Brazilian welfare. That
might be better spent talking to Amer-
icans about American welfare. Yet we
had no business in sending that money
to Brazil.
Is any of this a higher priority than
what we are doing at the border? I
would say not.
Is it more important to pay for the
cost of the situation on the border or
should we also be sending foreign wel-
fare abroad?
The United States spent $223 million
to fund a highway in Afghanistan. We
found out afterward that the security
that our government hired to protect
the people while they were building the
road at $1 million a year were actually
funneling the money to a terrorist
group, called the Haqqani network, our
sworn enemy. The Haqqani network is
known for killing our soldiers, but we
were paying those in the Haqqani net-
work for being security guards while
we wasted millions of dollars in build-
ing a highway in Afghanistan. I would
say let’s spend that money at home.
The road we have now built for the
Afghanis is in such disrepair after only
a few years that they can’t afford to
maintain it, so we are asking you to
cough up a little more money. They
need $22 million to keep the highway in
good repair.
We spent $273 million on a develop-
ment grant program that didn’t actu-
ally do anything. It taught foreign peo-
ple how to fill out grants to get more
money from us. It is not enough that
they are fleecing you and sending your
money to all of these boondoggle
projects around the world; we have a
program to teach foreigners how to get
more welfare from us.
This amendment takes $4 billion that
they want to spend on the border and
says: That is fine. Let’s do it. Yet let’s
take it from foreign aid. Let’s take it
from foreign welfare. Let’s take it from
llama fairs and guinea pig shows in
Peru. It is utterly ridiculous. This pro-
gram has not been looked at since 1985.
If we eliminate the program, we can
pay for the money they want to spend
at the border.
That is what it would mean to be re-
sponsible legislators—to make prior-
ities, decide where to spend the money,
and not just simply run up the tab and
say: Your kids and grandkids can pay
for it.
I recommend a ‘‘yea’’ vote on offset-
ting the spending for this supplemental
spending bill, and I hope Americans
will watch to see who votes to offset
this by cutting wasteful foreign wel-
fare.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama.
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I believe
there is no longer any question that
the situation along our southern bor-
der has become a full-blown humani-
tarian and security crisis. I think that
is a given. Leader MCCONNELL has firm-
ly established that fact right here on

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4541
June 26, 2019
other side of a manufactured crisis
have fallen silent. At this juncture,
there is little need to recapitulate the
case for action.
We know what our professionals on
the frontlines need in order to get a
handle on the situation. The only ques-
tion is, Will the Congress come to-
gether and act or fall prey to partisan-
ship while the crisis escalates further?
I am pleased to say, last week, the
Appropriations Committee charted a
course for strong bipartisan action. By
a vote of 30 to 1, the committee ap-
proved an emergency appropriations
bill to address the crisis at the border—
30 to 1. Such an overwhelming bipar-
tisan vote would not have been possible
without the cooperation of my col-
league and good friend, Vice Chairman
LEAHY. I thank Senator LEAHY for
working with us to find a path forward.
This bipartisan committee product,
which it is and which I will soon offer
as a substitute amendment to the
House bill, provides $4.59 billion in
emergency supplemental appropria-
tions to address the humanitarian and
security crisis at the border.
It does not contain everything that
Senator LEAHY wanted, and it does not
contain everything that I wanted. More
importantly, it does not contain any
poison pills from either side, which is
remarkable. That is why it passed the
Appropriations Committee by a vote of
30 to 1, and that is what gives us the
best chance today, in the U.S. Senate—
without further delay—of passing a bill
that is badly needed.
I will take just a few minutes to
briefly outline for my colleagues the
particulars of the package reported by
the Appropriations Committee.
Of the total funding provided, the
lion’s share—$2.88 billion—will help the
Department of Health and Human
Services to provide safe and appro-
priate shelter and care for children in
its custody.
An additional $1.1 billion is included
for Customs and Border Protection to
establish migrant care and processing
facilities; to provide medical care and
consumables; and to pay travel and
overtime costs for personnel.
There is $209 million provided for Im-
migration and Customs Enforcement to
fund the transportation costs and med-
ical care for detainees; to conduct
human trafficking operations; and,
again, to pay travel and overtime costs
for our personnel there.
There is $30 million for FEMA in
order to reimburse States and local-
ities for expenses that they have in-
curred related to the massive influx of
migrants in their communities.
There is $220 million included for the
Department of Justice to help process
immigration cases and provide badly
needed resources to the U.S. Marshals
Service for the care and detention of
Federal prisoners.
Finally, $145 million is provided for
the various branches of the U.S. mili-
tary that have incurred operating ex-
penses in support of multiple missions
along the border.
I believe, overall, this is a solid bill.
It provides the resources that are need-
ed to address the crisis that we face at
the border. As I say again, it contains
no poison pills, and it is poised to pass
the Senate with strong bipartisan sup-
port, unlike the version that came out
of the House last night.
So I say to my colleagues in the
House, now that there is a bipartisan
acknowledgment that the crisis on our
southern border is real, do not derail
the one bipartisan vehicle with a real
chance of becoming law soon.
Those who want to alleviate the suf-
fering—and I think it is most of us—on
the southern border will soon have a
bipartisan path forward in the Senate
bill that we have here.
Those who choose to obstruct over
partisan demands will soon have a lot
of questions, I think, to answer when
the crisis escalates further, and it will.
I believe there is no excuse for leav-
ing town at the end of this week with-
out getting this job done. I hope we
will be coming together soon and do
our job.
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this
vote, the yeas are 37, the nays are 55.
Under the previous order, the 60-vote
threshold having not been achieved,
the bill was rejected.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader.
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to address the Sen-
ate briefly on leader time.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the
bill that was before us has failed. Most
of us on this side of the aisle would
have much preferred that bill, but it
has failed.
The bill that Senators SHELBY and
LEAHY have worked on diligently is
now before us. I am going to vote for it.
I think most of us on this side are
going to vote for it so that we can
quickly move to conference.
Speaker PELOSI has called the Presi-
dent and suggested a few changes. I
think there are four changes to this
bill. We could quickly have a con-
ference, talk about those four changes,
try to get them in the bill, and finish
this quickly. I hope that is what will
happen.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama.
AMENDMENT NO. 901
(Purpose: In the nature of a substitute.)
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I call up

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The

The bill clerk read as follows:
The Senator from Alabama [Mr. SHELBY]

Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4542 June 26, 2019
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report.
The bill clerk read as follows:
The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. PAUL]
proposes an amendment numbered 902 to
amendment No. 901.
Mr. PAUL. I ask unanimous consent
that the reading be dispensed with.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
The amendment is as follows:
(Purpose: To rescind $4,586,000,000 from
foreign assistance and exchange programs)
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing:
SEC. lll. Of the unobligated balances for fiscal
year 2019, there are hereby rescinded—
(1) all of the amounts for the East-West
Center;
(2) all of the amounts for the Inter-Amer-
ican Foundation; and
(3) from the amounts appropriated under
title III of the Department of State, Foreign
Operations, and Related Programs Appro-
priations Act, 2019 (division F of Public Law
116–6), an amount equal to the difference be-
tween $4,586,000,000 and the sum of the
amounts rescinded under paragraphs (1) and
(2).
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, we are
going to spend over $4 billion today,
and I just propose that we pay for it.
There is a humanitarian crisis at the
border, but there is also a debt crisis.
We spend hundreds of millions, if not
billions, on wasteful projects. Let’s
take it from foreign aid welfare and
spend it on our southern border. We
spend hundreds of thousands of dollars
subsidizing guinea pig farmers in Peru,
a llama fair in Bolivia, and advertise-
ments to buy carbon credits in Mexico.
There was $273 million spent trying to
teach foreigners how to fill out grant
applications to get more welfare from
the United States, $300,000 to help Bra-
zilians get off of Brazilian welfare, and
half a million dollars spent jump-start-
ing the Haitian film industry. There
are billions of dollars that we can
spend on the southern border, but we
should take it from somewhere and not
add it to the debt of our kids and our
grandkids.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina.
MOTION TO TABLE
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am
going to move to table this amend-
ment. Being the chairman of the For-
eign Operations Subcommittee, this is
taking one disaster and creating 100 in
its place. This $4.6 billion will destroy
all the humanitarian assistance we
have passed to deal with an unprece-
dented wave of refugees. The global
health programs are all impacted se-
verely, including PEPFAR and the
child survival and maternal health pro-
grams. This money comes out of those
accounts. Can you imagine how it is
going to be to deal with Ebola after
cutting the Global Health Program?
Programs to counter the influence of
Russia and China will be zeroed out.
Counter-human trafficking programs
will be dramatically reduced. Counter-
terrorism programs are all affected by
this amendment.
You are taking one problem at the
border, and if you enact the Paul
amendment, you will create 100 in its
place.
So I move to table the Paul amend-
ment No. 902.
I ask for the yeas and nays.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a
sufficient second?
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.
The Senator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the remaining
votes in the series be 10 minutes in
length.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
The clerk will call the roll on the
motion to table.

ORDER OF BUSINESS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that notwith-
standing rule XXII, the cloture mo-
tions filed on Senate amendment No.
764 and S. 1790 occur at a time to be de-
termined by the majority leader in
consultation with the Democratic lead-
er.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
H.R. 3401
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I
am glad that the bipartisan Senate
border supplemental has passed with
an overwhelming vote. I commend
Chairman SHELBY, Senator LEAHY, and
the members of the Appropriations
Committee for breaking the logjam.
S. 1790
Mr. President, on the NDAA, the
Democratic leader and I have had ex-
tensive discussions on the path forward
on the Defense bill. For the informa-
tion of all of our colleagues, we intend
to stay in session this week to finish
the NDAA bill and allow for a vote in
relation to the Udall amendment. Sen-
ators should plan to vote on Friday on
the Udall amendment. Yet the vote—
here is the good news—will start first
thing in the morning and be held open
into the afternoon to accommodate as
many Senators as possible.
To be clear, obviously, I believe that
the Udall amendment can and should
be defeated—I hope with a resounding
vote in the Senate—and that we should
put this issue to rest before we break
for the Fourth of July recess. Holding
up the Defense authorization bill is not
an acceptable outcome.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader.
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I
thank the majority leader for under-
standing how strongly we feel on the
Democratic side and how many Ameri-
cans feel that the constitutional right
of Congress to examine foreign conflict
and potential war should be upheld.
The fact that we will get a vote on the
Udall amendment, which is something
we have asked for, is only fair and only
right. There may be differences of
viewpoint on both sides, but the fact
that it will be on the floor and be de-
bated is exactly the right thing to do.
It is something we want and have
asked for, and I thank the majority
leader for understanding that and al-
lowing it to happen.
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I suggest
the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
BLACKBURN). Without objection, it is so
ordered.
IRAN
Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, Don-
ald Trump and the hawks in his admin-
istration are fueling a dangerous esca-
lation with Iran, and instead of taking
responsibility for this escalation, the
President is once again blaming others
for a crisis of his own making.
Adding to the confusion and concern
is the President’s penchant for using
his Twitter account or an outburst
from the Oval Office to jump between
calling for restraint and embracing a
potential war.
Instead of listening to the Presi-
dent’s latest outbursts or dissecting his
latest tweet, let’s take a hard look at
what he has done to bring us to this
dangerous moment.
In May 2018, Trump followed the lead
of the hawks in his administration and
unilaterally—unilaterally—pulled out
of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Ac-
tion, the JCPOA, breaking the agree-
ment and leaving its other signatories,
especially our allies in Europe, holding
the bag.
Only a few weeks earlier, Jim Mattis,
the President’s own Secretary of De-
fense, told the Senate Armed Services
Committee, on which I sit, that the
agreement was working as intended
and had been written with an assump-
tion that Iran would try to cheat. He
went on to note that while the deal was
imperfect, it established a strong veri-
fication and inspection regime that
Iran was complying with the agree-
ment.
I continue to agree with Secretary
Mattis’s conclusions. The purpose of
the JCPOA was to prevent Iran from
developing a nuclear weapon within a
2- to 3-month timeframe. That is the
kind of timeframe we were looking at.
The JCPOA was not intended to cover
Iran’s ballistic missile program or its
malign activities throughout the re-
gion.
What the JCPOA did accomplish,
however, was lengthening Iran’s nu-
clear breakout capacity from 3 months
to 1 year. It included strong limita-
tions on enrichment, redesigned and re-
built the Arak heavy water reactor so
it can only be used for peaceful-use re-
search purposes and not for the enrich-
ment of weapons-grade plutonium, and
required Iran to ship all spent nuclear
fuel out of the country.
The agreement also included a bind-
ing commitment from Iran to never
pursue a nuclear weapons program.
That is in the very beginning part of
the JCPOA document. This commit-
ment necessitated a continuous inspec-
tion regime by the International Atom-
ic Energy Agency, IAEA.
Further, the agreement included pro-
visions that would see the inter-
national community reimpose sanc-
tions automatically—the snapback—if
Iran was violating the deal.
Instead of building upon the JCPOA
to address Iran’s other malign activi-
ties, Donald Trump threw out all the
benefits of the deal, took on an enor-
mous risk, and isolated the United
States in the process.
In early April, the President took the
unprecedented step of designating the
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps,
the IRGC, a foreign terrorist organiza-
tion. He designated the IRGC as a for-
eign terrorist organization. That was
an unprecedented step, overruling the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
General Dunford, in the process. Gen-
eral Dunford argued that this first-of-
its-kind step would put American
troops in the region at risk for retalia-
tion. He was right.
Later that month, Donald Trump re-
scinded waivers granted to key Amer-
ican allies, such as Japan and India, to
purchase Iranian oil, effectively stran-
gling the Iranian economy in the proc-
ess. Over the past few months, the ad-
ministration has sent thousands of ad-
ditional troops and a carrier strike
group to the Persian Gulf.
These actions, taken unilaterally,
have isolated the United States from
our allies, encouraged Iran to stop
complying with elements of the nu-
clear deal and to step up their aggres-
sive actions in the region, and brought
us to the dangerous precipice of war.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4544 June 26, 2019
Although the President made the
eleventh-hour decision—actually, 10
minutes before a strike—to call off a
military response to Iran’s downing of
an Air Force drone, the fact that we
got so close to a military strike is
chilling, given the implications of ig-
niting an open war with Iran.
We have learned to our peril over the
past few years that Donald Trump does
not keep his word or the word of our
country. He says something one day,
only to reverse himself at a moment’s
notice. We cannot rely on his restraint
to avoid blundering into a war with
Iran. That is why I am continuing to
call on my colleagues to join in sup-
porting a vote on Senator UDALL’s
amendment to the National Defense
Authorization Act.
This amendment makes clear that
only Congress can authorize the use of
military force against Iran and would
provide a clear check on Donald
Trump, John Bolton, and other hawks
in the administration.
We cannot allow this administration
and this President a free hand to stack
the deck toward military action and
away from meaningful diplomacy. Oth-
erwise, we risk committing another
generation of American soldiers to a
protracted, disastrous war in the Mid-
dle East.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan.
TRIBUTE TO BILL SWEENEY
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I
rise today to pay tribute to my long-
time staff member and friend, Bill
Sweeney, who will be moving on to a
new challenge in his career after nearly
20 years of service on my team.
Bill actually started working on the
campaign November 1, 1999, and we
were sharing stories of his being up in
a crowded little space changing my
‘‘Stabenow for U.S. Congress’’ signs to
‘‘Stabenow for U.S. Senate’’ signs with
little stickers that we used because we
didn’t have very much money at the
time.
Bill has been with me a long, long
time, and after so many years, it is
tough to know what to say because
there is so much to say.
Bill Sweeney has worn more hats on
my team than anyone ever has. He
started working on my campaign, as I
mentioned, for the U.S. Senate as a
fundraiser. After the campaign, I hired
him as my systems administrator, and
he played an integral role in setting up
my new Senate office. By the way, we
are still today using the systems he set
up, and I truly believe they are the
best the Senate has.
After a short time, I promoted him to
director of information technology.
Then, Bill’s gift for messaging and
writing led to more promotions as my
director of outreach, speechwriter, and
then senior communications adviser.
Eventually, he took on a broader role
on my team as deputy chief of staff,
chief of staff, and his position now as
staff director of the Democratic Policy
and Communications Committee. But
these are just Bill’s official titles.
He has been a key strategist, writer,
crisis manager, event planner, gram-
marian, computer programmer, and
graphic designer. From directing key
communications initiatives to design-
ing floor charts, no job has been too big
or too small for Bill, and I will be for-
ever grateful.
He has drafted and edited countless
speeches, columns, releases, con-
stituent letters, statements, and talk-
ing points over the years.
Born and raised in Michigan, he has
always been able to capture the values
and the heart of Michigan in his
writings. His attention to detail is im-
peccable. He is an expert on proof-
reading and has impressively planned
and organized our annual caucus re-
treats and has provided us with ex-
traordinary experiences and speakers.
Bill is also one of the most creative
people I know, from designing logos to
inventing the Velcro ‘‘countdown’’
floor chart, like the one you see here,
which shows how many days Bill has
worked for me in the U.S. Senate. It is
actually very cool. I have to show you:
They come off. That is pretty inven-
tive. Whenever you see these on the
floor of the U.S. Senate, you can think
of Bill Sweeney. So we had to make
sure Bill had his own chart before leav-
ing.
He is someone who has always been
able to make something look good and
function well at the same time. He has
a passion for organization. He designed
many of the systems that my office re-
lies on to run efficiently today. As I
said earlier, we literally are using inte-
grated systems that Bill has designed
over the years.
Bill is also one of the smartest people
I know. I will miss his sharp wit and
his sense of humor. With all of the hats
Bill has worn, he is leaving very big
shoes to fill. I will always be incredibly
grateful for his loyalty, his work ethic,
his friendship, and his passion for serv-
ice.
Bill will be joining the team at
AARP and continuing to work on so
many issues we have championed to-
gether over the years. I wish him in-
credible success and happiness in his
new chapter in his career. I apologize,
but I am so happy he is moving on to
a big challenge and yet so sorry to lose
him.
Thank you, Bill.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
(The remarks of Mr. MERKLEY per-
taining to the introduction of S. 1987

‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and
Joint Resolutions.’’)
Mr. MERKLEY. I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio.
S. 1790
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I
would like to speak about the legisla-
tion that is before us right now on the
floor. It is the annual National Defense
Authorization Act, incredibly impor-
tant legislation that the Senate, pretty
much every year, is able to pass on a
bipartisan basis.
It is really an exception. There is so
much else that we are locked up on
here with partisan gridlock. With re-
gard to our troops, we tend to come to-
gether, Republicans and Democrats,
and make commitments to them that
we are going to give our men and
women serving in the Armed Forces
the resources and support they need to
carry out their critical mission.
We have now proceeded to that legis-
lation. I want to talk a little about it.
It has a lot of incredibly important
things in it. It is really important to
Ohio.
In my State of Ohio, we have a lot of
defense installations. They are very
important to our national security be-
cause they do important work. They
are also important to our Ohio econ-
omy. Ohio’s defense spending now ac-
counts for more than 66,000 direct jobs,
more than $4 billion in salaries, and
more than a $14 billion economic im-
pact. Forty-three of our 88 counties in
Ohio are impacted by these facilities.
So they are critical to our State, to
our economy, to our soldiers and their
families, and to tens of thousands of ci-
vilian employees as well.
Again, because of the good work
being done in Ohio, including at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
which is our largest single employer in
Ohio, it is really important to our mili-
tary readiness and to our national se-
curity. This bill has proceeded through
the Armed Services Committee in the
bipartisan manner in which it usually
is done. I love seeing that. It is legisla-
tion that every Member of this body, I
hope, will be able to support at the end.
It has a lot of important initiatives
and some much needed reforms—in-
cluding, by the way, this year, a 3.1-
percent pay raise for our troops. I
think that is necessary. They are in
harm’s way around the world. They are
ensuring our safety, and we should en-
sure that they are fairly compensated
for their hard work and their sac-
rifices.
One of the bill’s other important ini-

State is authorizing $1.7 billion to in-

our M1 Abrams tanks and also for up-
grades to 165 tanks that are already in
service. That is an increase from last
year’s figure. It also authorizes about
$249 million to upgrade the Stryker ar-
mored fighting vehicles.

and the Stryker are the most advanced
and lethal tanks and armored vehicles
on the battlefield today. One of our pri-
orities in Congress should be to ensure
that we are providing our troops with
what they need to be able to do their
duty and to protect themselves. We
want to be sure they have the highest
quality equipment to be able to do
that. Only by ensuring that these funds
are allocated to such key vehicles like
this can we be sure our Armed Forces
are able to maintain their advantage—
their qualitative advantage on the bat-
tlefield.
This isn’t just a big win for our mili-
tary, however. It is also a big win for a
plant called the Joint Systems Manu-
facturing Center, or JSMC, which is
the tank plant in Lima, OH. The best
tanks and armored vehicles in the
world are made at this plant. It has the
best workforce in the world to do it. I
have seen them in action many times.
It is the only facility in the United
States that has the capacity to produce
tanks like the Abrams tank and the
Stryker armored vehicle. It is a really
important strategic asset for our coun-
try in Lima, OH.
Having been out there a lot, visiting
with the workers, watching them work,
seeing what they can make, and having
talked to the soldiers in the field who
use these products, I can tell you how
important they are. Most recently, I
was at the Lima tank plant in March
where I was able to speak directly with
the workers there about the long-term
health of the Lima plant, which the
Obama administration, about 8 years
ago, attempted to shutter.
The President sent a budget to Con-
gress—President Obama—saying we
would like to close down the tank
plant because in the future we won’t
need these tanks, at least not imme-
diately, and some day we will have a
new generation of tanks, and mean-
while, let’s just shut down this plant.
Some of us stood up, and I fought
against that. We were able to convince
the U.S. Congress to overturn what the
President wanted to do and instead to
provide funding for the tank plant to
keep it open. Even though production
was down at that time, we were able to
keep the plant open and not have it be
mothballed, as the administration
wanted to do. Thank goodness we did
that because now we know—particu-
larly with the Russian influence in Eu-
rope and what our allies are telling us
they need—that we have to have these
armored vehicles and these tanks, and
we need to continually upgrade them.
If we had shut down that plant, we
would have lost this incredible work-
force that is there building something
that is unique. There is nothing quite
like the welding, as an example, and
the cutting that goes into our tanks.
We also would have lost the supply
chain. That would have been detri-
mental. It would have cost taxpayers
so much more to try to take that plant
out of mothballs and recreate it again
than to keep it open as we did.
Now, frankly, we kept it open mostly
through foreign sales. Other countries
around the world, including our allies,
were still buying Abrams tanks and
Stryker vehicles. And Israel was buy-
ing the Nemera vehicle, which is an ar-
mored vehicle that is much like our
Abrams tank without the turret. That
kept us going, plus a little bit of up-
grade to our tanks.
Now, today, again, and since 8 years
ago, when there was a proposal to shut-
ter this plant, we have been able to in-
crease production slowly but surely to
the point that today we have the abil-
ity to really have that plant humming.
We have a lot of people who are work-
ing. It is on its way up, and that is
really exciting.
The funding allocated under this leg-
islation we talked about today is really
important because it will allow this
JSMC—the Lima tank plant—to hire,
train, and retain more workers dedi-
cated to making the best equipment
possible to protect our troops.
I will tell you that the workers at
the tank plant are very proud of what
they do. A lot of them are veterans.
They know that what they are doing
every day by providing these armored
vehicles has the potential to save the
lives of the American men and women
in uniform across the world who are re-
lying on these vehicles to keep them
safe and to be able to have that quali-
tative advantage on the battlefield by
having the best equipment possible.
Last year, I had the opportunity to
be the first Member of Congress to see
the latest models of the Stryker Dra-
goon vehicles, up-armored at Lima.
This was a real fight also. The Army
came to us and said: We need to have
some additional capability with regard
to our Stryker vehicles to be able to
push back against potential threats on
the European continent. At that time
we had no tanks in Europe, and we
needed to upgrade what the Strykers
could do by providing for additional
lethality, particularly to provide a tur-
ret on top of the Stryker vehicle. We
did that.
Now, as I saw with the 2nd Calvary
Regiment in Germany, they are using
these vehicles, and those drivers of
those vehicles, those other troops who
are using those vehicles, love them. It
feels like, again, it gives them the abil-
ity to be effective on the battlefield.
They are also training with a coalition
of our allies, including Poland, the
United Kingdom, and Denmark. The
work our men and women in uniform
are doing with our allies in Europe is
vitally important because it forms a
framework of defense to protect our
NATO allies from aggression.
The importance of an American mili-
tary presence in Europe has never been
in doubt, but perhaps now, more than
at any time since the end of the Cold
War, the security of Europe is uncer-
tain. We have seen repeatedly, these
past few years, instances of military
aggression, electoral interference, and
diplomatic provocation by Russia to-
ward its western neighbors.
Nowhere is Russia’s continued ma-
ligned behavior on display more than
in the country of Ukraine. For the past
5 years, we have seen Ukraine work to
break free of Russia’s orbit and seek
greater integration with the demo-
cratic framework of the West, with the
EU, with the United States, and with
our NATO allies. Most vividly during
the 2014 Maidan protest in Kiev, Russia
responded to these appeals for democ-
racy by illegally invading and annexing
Crimea, which remains occupied in vio-
lation of international law to this day.
In the eastern region of Donbass,
more than 4,000 Ukrainian soldiers
have been killed fighting Russian-
backed separatists. I have been to the
frontlines, the so-called line of contact
in the Donbass, and let me tell you
that it is very much a hot war. Just
last November, the Russian Navy at-
tacked three Ukrainian naval vessels
and captured two dozen Ukrainian sail-
ors in international waters near the
Kerch Strait. These individuals remain
unlawfully detained by the Russian
Government to this day. I urge my
Senate colleagues and the entire inter-
national community to join me in call-
ing for the release of those sailors.
I know here, on this side of the At-
lantic, what is happening in Ukraine
can sometimes seem like it is half a
world away, but it is not. It is very rel-
evant. In a sense, it is where the mod-
ern battle is taking place between two
different ideologies—between whether
a country wants to go toward freedom
and democracy in the West or whether,
again, to stay under the orbit of the
Russian influence.
Here, in Ohio, we have a large and vi-
brant Ukrainian-American community,
particularly in Northeast Ohio, who
have a vested interest in seeing that
their ancestral homeland can defend
itself from Russian aggression as it
works to align itself more with NATO
and the West while promoting a plat-
form of democracy, freedom, trans-
parency, and free markets.
Frankly, we should all be supportive
of Ukraine’s efforts to reshape itself as
a beacon of liberty in the region. As co-
chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus,
which I cofounded with my colleague
Dick Durbin, I have been an advocate
of the Ukraine as it works to break
free from Russia’s influence. I traveled
to Kyiv to meet with their newly elect-
ed President, Volodymyr Zelensky. I
am encouraged from my meetings that
they will stay on the right path toward
reform, but to properly do so, they also
have to defend themselves from Rus-
sian aggression.
For the past 3 years, I have success-
fully introduced and passed amend-
ments to the legislation before us
today, the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act, to expand U.S. military aid to
the Ukraine. These provisions built and
expanded the primary statutory frame-
work for U.S. security assistance to
Ukraine, the Ukraine Security Assist-
ance Initiative.

ther $300 million authorized in lethal

and nonlethal aid to Ukraine in the
NDAA. This security assistance pack-
age is good news and sends a strong
signal that America stands with the
Ukrainian people, and we will make
sure their military has the capabilities
it needs to defend its sovereign terri-
tory on land and in the sea and air.
But our commitment to Ukraine se-
curity should extend to other forms of
support as well. I have offered an
amendment that I hope will be in-
cluded in the final bill to pressure Rus-
sia to release the Ukrainian sailors
kidnapped in the Kerch Strait. It would
do so by adding the release of the 24
Ukrainian sailors as a condition for
any U.S. military cooperation with
Russia. We need to take a firm stance
against Russia’s blatant disregard for
international law in this matter, and
passing this amendment will help us do
so.
I am glad to see that the National
Defense Authorization Act will keep
the lines of production running, from
the factory floors in Lima to the
frontlines all around the world. I am
glad we will be continuing to help
Ukraine defend itself from unlawful
Russian aggression. I hope we can also
push for the release of the Ukrainian
sailors who have been detained ille-
gally in the Kerch Strait.
I look forward to voting on the bill’s
final passage in the Senate in the next
week so the men and women who give
so much of themselves to keep us safe
have the resources they need to fulfill
their important mission.

TRIBUTE TO CAL WILLIAMS
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is
Wednesday. Now, normally it is Thurs-
day when I come down here to talk
about somebody who is making a huge
difference in my State, somebody we
refer to as the Alaskan of the Week,
someone who is doing something for
the community or the State or the
country or maybe all of the above. I
know we have a new set of pages, but I
think it is commonly known that this
is the most anticipated speech of the
week by the pages. I see the heads nod-
ding, so that is great.
You guys are learning well, early, so
that is wonderful, and I know that the
Presiding Officer really enjoys it as
well.
I am going to talk today about Cal-
vin Williams, whom everybody in Alas-
ka knows as Cal, who is our Alaskan of
the Week, who lives in Anchorage via
Louisiana. I am going to talk a lot
about Cal here and why he certainly
deserves this great honor, but also
when I give these remarks, I like to
talk just a little bit about what is
going on in Alaska at the time.
We have just celebrated the summer
solstice, which in a lot of States isn’t a
big deal, but in Alaska, it is actually a
huge deal. It is the longest day of the
year, which was last week, and that
really means something. You get the 12
midnight Sun energy, and everybody is
out. There are celebrations throughout
the State. Friends and neighbors gath-
er at parties and community events
well past 12 midnight. I had the oppor-
tunity to spend last weekend in Fair-
banks, AK, where there was a 12 mid-
night Sun baseball game and a 12 mid-
night Sun 10K run. I got to participate
in some of that. There was just great
energy and a great feeling and a lot of
sunlight all night.
Across the country and in Alaska, we
also just celebrated Juneteenth, which
marks the anniversary of the Emanci-
pation Proclamation. Anchorage cele-
brated the weekend before last, and Cal
Williams, our Alaskan of the Week,
was there, as he has been there nearly
every year since the first celebration in
the 1980s. Cal is a staple at that event
and has been at so many other events
in Alaska over the decades where peo-
ple get together, where he has been a
community leader and has tried to do
good things for our communities
throughout the State. So let me tell
you a little bit about Cal and how
lucky we are to have him in the great
State of Alaska.
He was born in 1941 in Monroe, LA. I
know we have some Louisianans as
pages here. That was the segregated
South, and he was born 7 days before
the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.
He is from a very patriotic family. His
parents immediately joined the cause
of fighting and supporting our Nation
during World War II. His mother
worked in the factories to help out the
war effort, and his father joined the
Army and was sent to the Pacific the-
ater to defend America.
Basically, Cal was raised by his
grandmother, who happened to live
across the street from church and a K–
12 Catholic school, built and run by the
Franciscans to serve the African-Amer-
ican Catholic community in the area.
Nobody in his family was Catholic, but
it was the best school in the area, so
that was where he went. The lessons he
was taught at this school, the Little
Flower Academy—to serve the less for-
tunate, to feed the hungry, to help all
in need—have stayed with Cal forever
and have really driven his sense of
service.
The much beloved Sister Consuela,
who was the longtime principal and
homeroom teacher, made sure that he
learned all this.
Sister Consuela was feared and respected.
If you did anything bad, if the Sister didn’t
see you [do something bad], you knew that
God did. I carry that with me today.
After high school, he attended Gram-
bling State University—another all-
Black school—where he pursued the-
ater and singing. Anybody who knows
Cal knows this is another thing that
has stayed with him throughout his
life.
Then, like his patriotic mom and
dad, he decided to enlist in the Air
Force. He was stationed at Vandenberg
Air Force Base, where he worked on
the Titan II Missile System—an elite
position, something that he credits to
the schooling he received at Little
Flower.
When he got out of the Air Force, he
made it back to Louisiana to take care
of his father, who had gotten sick. This
was during the height of the movement
for civil rights—one of the greatest
movements, of course, in our Nation’s
history, a lot of which took place here
on this Senate floor. As he often does,
Cal jumped in. He jumped in with both
feet. He began working with CORE, the
Congress of Racial Equality—one of the
leading civil rights organizations in
the early years of the civil rights
movement. He and six other students
were the first Black students to proud-
ly integrate what was then called
Northeast Louisiana State College.
Eventually, a friend who had moved
to Alaska talked him into coming up
to our great State. This was in 1965. Cal
brought all of his intelligence, his the-
atrical and musical talents, his abiding
deep faith, his fun, and his deep com-
mitment to civil rights and community
service to our State in 1965.
In some ways, it was a good time to
be an activist in Alaska. Our State cer-
tainly isn’t perfect. It is a State,
though, that is very committed to
equal rights and justice for all. Yet,
just like everywhere in the country, we
had our problems, and we had our chal-
lenges. As I mentioned, we certainly
were not perfect in that realm, so Cal
had work to do.
Initially, he was a dishwasher in the
hospital by day and was a community
activist by night. He helped to lobby
the mayor’s office in Anchorage to get
paved roads and to bring electricity to
predominantly African-American
neighborhoods. He also helped bring
people into the voting booths, which
was so important.
The same friend who brought him to
Alaska, Charles LeViege, started a
newspaper that focused on the African-
American community. He joined with
the Alaska Native leadership to lobby
for the landmark legislation that,
again, took place on the Senate floor,
here, in 1971—the Alaska Native Claims
Settlement Act. He became the presi-
dent of the Anchorage chapter of the
NAACP, of which he is still a vice
president to this very day.
I have only gotten to 1971, and you
can see how much he has done.
In the 1970s, he had a little sojourn in
Hollywood to fulfill a lifelong dream of
being in the movies. He was. He got
some gigs—a spot in a film with Angie
Dickinson. The pages don’t know who
she is, but she was a great actress.
But like some people who leave Alas-
ka, he missed it too much, so he de-
cided to come back, and he did.

June 26, 2019
So over the years since he has been
back, he has helped raise funds for an
African-American economic develop-
ment venture. The group built a build-
ing in the Fairview community of An-
chorage, which is still there today.
They had a social club on the top spon-
sored by the Alaska Black Caucus—a
place to meet with executives and bank
officers in a nice setting, community
leaders.
He worked in television. He worked
for the Alaska Housing Finance Cor-
poration, which has been key to help-
ing people get home ownership.
All through these years, he clung to
his roots and his faith. He is a member
of the Knights of Columbus and a faith-
ful parishioner at St. Anthony’s Catho-
lic Church in Anchorage, where he is
the director of the church’s Filipino
gospel choir, which sounds like angels.
‘‘When we sing,’’ he said, ‘‘we sing for
the Lord.’’ And no doubt, when they
sing, the Lord is listening.
He visits prisons to read the Bible
with inmates, sings every week to the
patients at Providence Extended Care
and every other week to our senior
home, which we call the Pioneer Home
in Alaska. The residents there love
Cal’s Elvis impersonations.
If you are in Alaska and happen to be
there for Christmas, you should stop by
Bean’s Cafe, a place where the hungry
go for a meal, and Cal will be there
every Christmas wearing a Santa cap,
singing for hours for everybody who
comes in the door.
This is a gentleman who has done so
much for his community and my State,
and what is he most proud of? When
asked, ‘‘My greatest achievement was
in 2017 when I received the St. Francis
Stewardship Award from the Arch-
diocese of Anchorage,’’ Cal said.
St. Francis was the patron saint of
the Little Flower Academy. ‘‘I have
come full circle,’’ he said. ‘‘Sister
Consuela would be proud of me.’’ Then
he adds: ‘‘But nothing was ever enough
for her.’’
It is enough for all of us, though, Cal.
I thank him for all he has done for An-
chorage, for so many different commu-
nities, for Alaska, and as an example
for our country—for his generosity,
kindness, enthusiasm, faith, and faith-
filled service throughout his life.
Congratulations to Cal for being our
Alaskan of the Week.
TRIBUTE TO THOMAS MANSOUR
Mr. President, it is with a heavy
heart that my office is saying goodbye
to my very first Coast Guard fellow, re-
cently promoted—actually, promoted
yesterday—to lieutenant commander,
Thomas Mansour.
Thomas happens to be sitting right
next to me here on the Senate floor.
Tom is from Montgomery County, MD.
He graduated from Eckerd College in
St. Petersburg, FL. We were lucky to
have him join my office as a Coast
Guard fellow for the last 2 years, and
he has done great work.
I am going to brag about him a little
bit here on the floor. I will probably
embarrass him.
Among other things, he was instru-
mental in the 2018 Coast Guard Author-
ization Act. The subcommittee that I
chair on the Commerce, Science, and
Transportation Committee is in charge
of the Coast Guard. We were the ones
drafting that. It had many provisions
in it for the whole Coast Guard, cer-
tainly many for Alaska and other parts
of the country.
He also brought his expertise to the
2017 and 2018 Homeland Security budg-
ets. His efforts helped secure landmark
appropriations for the first Polar Secu-
rity Cutter, an icebreaker for the Coast
Guard, the first one in 40 years, and for
critical infrastructure projects for the
Coast Guard around Alaska and around
the rest of the country.
Probably his signature initiative—
and very, very hard work—was on a bill
that we affectionately know in my of-
fice as the Save Our Seas Act, both the
first one, which our offices worked
closely on with Senator WHITEHOUSE
from Rhode Island and was signed by
the President last fall to much fanfare
in the Oval Office, and our Save Our
Seas Act 2.0, which Senator WHITE-
HOUSE and Senator MENENDEZ and I
rolled out in a press conference just
this morning.
SOS 2.0, as we call it, is an innova-
tive piece of legislation that really sets
us on a promising path as a nation to
tackle the serious problem of plastics,
ocean debris, and trash that enter our
oceans and harm fisheries, marine life,
and possibly human life. This litter
ends up on the shores of Alaska, all
around America, and threatens the
livelihoods of coastal communities
throughout America.
Tom did yeoman’s work to ensure
that we introduced in the Senate today
a comprehensive, substantive bill that
all stakeholders—Democrats, Repub-
licans, the Trump administration, en-
vironmental groups, industry—are all
working on together. Literally, all of
the key stakeholders on this critical
issue are pulling on the same oar.
He did incredible work on this bill.
He is a great team player, someone I
am proud of and we are going to miss.
Tom is getting married this summer
to his fiance Meg, and they will be en-
tering a whole new chapter in their
lives. It will be an exciting one, I am
sure. We wish them all the best.
I can’t thank Tom enough for all of
the work he has done for my State, for
our country, and I ask that all of my
colleagues in the Senate recognize the
great work that he did. Just here on
the spot, I might even make him an
honorary Alaskan of the Week for the
great job he has done.
Thank you for the opportunity to say
a few words about Tom.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.

IMMIGRATION
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the issue
of immigration is one that is front and
center in the minds of most Americans,
as it should be.
For the last 21⁄2 years, our country
has been roiling with immigration con-
troversy. This new President, now 21⁄2
years into his term, came to office and
immediately instituted a travel ban on
a majority of Muslim countries. It was
controversial.
In the city of Chicago, people showed
up spontaneously at the airport, law-
yers, to counsel travelers to try to find
some volunteer effort that might re-
spond to their worry and concern about
the travel ban imposed by President
Trump.
The case went to court. The court
stayed this decision and, in a later ad-
judication, allowed it to go forward.
It was the first of many actions
taken by President Trump on the issue
of immigration—most of them very
controversial.
I remember the repeal of DACA in
September of 2017. This is a program I
had worked on for years. It started
with the DREAM Act, which I intro-
duced with my fellow U.S. Senator
Barack Obama as cosponsor. We tried
to pass it here in the Senate but were
stopped time and again by the rules of
the Senate and the filibuster.
Regardless of that, time passed and
President Obama became President,
and I appealed to him, with the assist-
ance of Senator Lugar, a Republican
Senator of Indiana, asking if he could
find some way as President to provide
relief to these young people brought to
the United States as children, who
wanted a chance to earn their way to
legal status in America.
President Obama came up with a pro-
gram called DACA, and that program
said that if you are one of those chil-
dren, you could come forward, pay a
substantial filing fee, go through a
criminal background check, and if we
established that you are no threat to
this country, that you are moving for-
ward with your education and had
plans for a job and a career, we would
allow you to stay legally in the United
States and not be deported for 2 years
at a time, renewable—check in and
make sure that your status hasn’t
changed.
In the end, 790,000—790,000—young
people across America took advantage
of DACA. Their lives were changed
overnight. With DACA, there was no
longer a fear of a knock on a door.
They could become students and, as
students, become teachers.
They can learn skills to be nurses,
engineers, entrepreneurs, even doctors.
It was a liberation for these 790,000
given the chance, finally, to be part of
America and its future.
As I have said so many times on the
floor, and Senator MENENDEZ was the
first to ever say it, and I thought it
was such an apt description of these

S4548 June 26, 2019
young people: They had spent their en-
tire lives pledging allegiance to that
flag every morning, believing it was
their flag. They learned, at some point,
they were not legally here in America.
President Obama gave them a chance—
790,000.
In September of 2017, President Don-
ald Trump ended the DACA Program.
He challenged Congress: Pass a law.
Don’t rely on an Executive order; pass
a law. Well, we tried. We tried, on a bi-
partisan basis in the Senate, and Presi-
dent Trump rejected our effort. It was
unfortunate, but it meant that these
people—these 790,000 and hundreds of
thousands of others who could have
been eligible—were stopped in their
tracks. Luckily—luckily—the courts
came to their rescue and said for these
people, despite President Trump’s deci-
sion, the 790,000 should be protected
from deportation. No new ones could
apply, but it gave them temporary re-
lief, which could end any day, any
week, or any month. That, in my mind,
was the second major move by Presi-
dent Trump to roil up this immigration
situation in America, to get tough on
790,000 young men and women who sim-
ply wanted a chance to live in this
country.
He then terminated temporary pro-
tected status. That was a category of
immigration given to people who were
in dire circumstances—victims of ter-
rible extreme weather events or polit-
ical and human disasters in their coun-
try—who were allowed to come here
and live in the United States in a pro-
tected status, hundreds of thousands of
them from all over the world. This
President, Donald Trump, said: The
end of it. We are going to put an end to
it. It is over. That was the third strike
as far as I was concerned, but it wasn’t
the end, by far.
Last June 2018, with a great deal of
pride and with biblical quotes, Attor-
ney General Jeff Sessions came forward
and announced a zero-tolerance policy:
Anyone presenting himself at the bor-
der would be considered suspect crimi-
nal, and if they had in their custody a
young child, they would be separated.
In the end, at least—at least—2,880 in-
fants, toddlers, and children were sepa-
rated from their parents. It was a dra-
matic move. It was an inhumane move,
but it was done to create what they
call a deterrence to discourage people
from coming to our border. Within
days, the public reaction against zero
tolerance grew to a point where even
this President, who does not have
‘‘sorry’’ in his vocabulary, came for-
ward and said they were going to end
that policy of zero tolerance.
What about the children, though, the
ones who actually were separated? It
took a Federal judge in Southern Cali-
fornia to come forward and say there
had to be an accounting of the children
and their parents and a reuniting. It
went on for weeks and months. Still, to
this day, there are children adrift in
America. Their families can’t be found
because zero tolerance—this inhumane
policy—was such an abject failure.
Even ‘‘ending it’’ didn’t end the strug-
gle that many of these young people
are still going through to this day.
That was the fourth thing this Presi-
dent did by way of getting tough on
immigration policy.
Then he announced several weeks ago
in one of his infamous tweets that he
was going to initiate a policy of mass
arrests and mass deportations. There
are some 11 million—that is the best
estimate—undocumented people in this
country, and the President said mil-
lions would be deported. We saw it in
its earliest stages around the city of
Chicago.
Betty Rendon, a grandmother who
had been in the United States for more
than 10 years, was deported. How dan-
gerous was Betty Rendon to this coun-
try? Not at all. In fact, she was a semi-
nary student at a Lutheran seminary
near Chicago. She had deep family
roots, children and grandchildren in
the community who were American
citizens, but that was not enough. ICE,
the agency of enforcement of Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, issued de-
portation orders, and she was forced to
leave this country.
I have asked those in charge at the
Department of Homeland Security:
What threat was this woman to Amer-
ica? After being here 10 years and liv-
ing a life that showed she was no
threat to anyone, why was she a pri-
ority to deport from this country?
They couldn’t answer.
Now we have an unprecedented hu-
manitarian crisis at our border. I
thought long and hard about the state-
ment I am about to make and the
photo which I am about to display.
Even though it has been on the front
page of major newspapers like the New
York Times, it is such a heartbreaking
photo that I at least warn in advance
anyone following this speech that if
you would be troubled by the images in
this photo, please look away or turn
away from what I am about to show
you, but I believe it has to be shown to
the American people. It is a photo of a
shocking and horrifying image of Oscar
Alberto Martinez Ramirez and his 23-
month-old daughter Valeria. They died
in their effort to try to cross from Mex-
ico into the United States. This is the
photo which was in the newspapers. It
is a shocking portrayal of the despera-
tion this family faced.
We are told by his wife that they
tried to come through the ordinary
port of entry, the usual place to
present yourself to seek asylum in the
United States—this mother, father,
and child—and they were told that the
ordinary port of entry was closed to
them. So they attempted to cross the
Rio Grande River.
From what we were told, this father
took his little daughter, less than 2
years old, and swam across the river.
He put her on the bank and then went
back to help his wife come across. His
daughter panicked and jumped in the
river behind him. He tried to rescue
her. They both drowned.
This is an illustration of the crisis in
real terms, a crisis we face at this bor-
der that should never be taking place.
Valeria, this 23-month-old girl, ac-
cording to her mother, loved to dance,
play with her stuffed animals, and
brush the hair of her madre and padre.
Her father Oscar had sold his motor-
cycle and borrowed money to flee from
El Salvador to come to the United
States. He and his wife, Tania Vanessa
Avalos, were simply looking for safety
and opportunity for their family.
Vanessa’s mother said: ‘‘They wanted a
better future for their girl.’’ They
planned to cross into the United States
and seek asylum and try to find a safe
place in the future.
That is the reality of what we are
discussing on the floor of the Senate
this evening and have been for the last
several days. Unfortunately, President
Trump responded to this tragedy with
a political statement. He tweeted:
‘‘The Democrats should change the
Loopholes and Asylum Laws so lives
will be saved at our Southern Border.’’
I might remind the President that
the same laws he now deals with in this
border crisis were exactly the laws
President Obama was faced with when
he was President. Something different
has happened. It isn’t just the laws of
this country; it is the way we are ad-
ministering the laws that currently
exist.
I sincerely believe we are better than
this situation depicted in that photo-
graph and what we have heard over and
over. I believe America can have a se-
cure border and respect our inter-
national obligations to provide safe
haven to those fleeing persecution, as
we have done as Democrats and Repub-
licans for decades before this adminis-
tration.
Yesterday I met with Mark Morgan.
Last month, President Trump named
him as Acting Director of U.S. Immi-
gration Customs Enforcement, ICE.
Mr. Morgan, a former marine and
former FBI agent, had been asked to
carry out the mass arrests that Presi-
dent Trump talked about in his tweet
several weeks ago and the mass depor-
tations of millions of immigrants
whom the President had threatened.
Shortly before I met with Mr. Mor-
gan, he was named to a different posi-
tion, Acting Director of U.S. Customs
and Border Protection. As of yester-
day, he moved from being in charge of
interior enforcement within the United
States to be in charge of solving the
humanitarian crisis we now face at our
border.
If that sounds like a rash move and
hard to explain, it is not the only one.
In the 21⁄2 years that President Trump
has been President, we have had four
different people leading the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security—four—in
21⁄2 years, and it is not the fault of the
Senate or Congress for holding up
nominations. They just change that
often. Within the Department of Home-
land Security, in every major depart-
ment, we have had repeated turnovers

and changeovers in the leaders there.
Even those today who are nominally in
charge are in an acting capacity. They
can’t bring them through the regular
order of vetting and background checks
to be given these responsible positions.
So as of yesterday, Mr. Morgan is in
charge of this crisis at the border.
There is a gaping leadership vacuum
in the Trump administration’s Depart-
ment of Homeland Security. To have
four different heads of the Department
in 21⁄2 years, to have every position of
responsibility for immigration or bor-
der security held by a temporary ap-
pointee is unacceptable, and the White
House has not submitted names to Con-
gress for permanent nominations to
these positions.
The Trump administration can shuf-
fle the deck chairs, but we know the
obvious: President Trump’s immigra-
tion and border security policies are
failing. Their failures are found not
only in the detention of children and
families in inhumane circumstances
but also this tragic photograph of a
desperate couple turned away at the
border who tried their best to find an-
other way to present themselves in the
United States.
We have a responsibility in Congress,
Democrats and Republicans, to deal
with this crisis that has been created
by this administration.
In February, after the President fi-
nally agreed to end the longest govern-
ment shutdown in the history of the
United States, Congress passed a bipar-
tisan omnibus appropriations bill that
included $414 million—in February, $414
million—for humanitarian assistance
at the border. I have asked what hap-
pened to this money. The explanations
are hard to follow. Some said: Well,
more than half of this humanitarian
assistance has been invested in a build-
ing which will be ready for occupancy
in about a year and a half.
Here we have kids without diapers at
the border, questionable food sources,
filthy clothes, separation of children
from families, and they are setting out
to build a building that might be open
in a year and a half. It would seem to
me that those who were in medical
practice and triage cases would cer-
tainly start with the immediate hu-
manitarian challenge before they start
the long-term responsibility of build-
ing a building. More needs to be done
at our border.
In April, I visited El Paso, TX. What
I saw in the Border Patrol’s over-
crowded facilities was heartbreaking. I
want to add here, as I do every time I
bring this up, that I believe the men
and women—the professional men and
women at the border, the ones I met
and spoke to—are caring people. They
are genuinely concerned by the human-
itarian crisis they see unfolding before
them every single day. Some undoubt-
edly have done improper things and
mistreated these detainees, but the
ones I spoke to understood, as human
beings, the need for us to do more as a
country.
Last month, I led 24 Senators in call-
ing on the International Committee of
the Red Cross and the inspector gen-
eral of the Department of Homeland
Security to investigate these Border
Patrol facilities, including the ones I
visited in El Paso. The circumstances
there were unacceptable by any normal
American standard. To think that we
were packing these people into deten-
tion cells far beyond the capacity—‘‘ca-
pacity 35’’ written over the door. I
counted 150 standing shoulder to shoul-
der in that room with one toilet. It is
just unacceptable and impossible to ex-
plain that this is happening in Amer-
ica.
For me to call on the international
Red Cross to look at this circumstance
is something I never thought I would
do. I have done that before but only in
foreign countries, asking that some of
the horrible conditions in the deten-
tion of prisoners be investigated by the
International Red Cross. I never
thought I would be asking the same of
the Red Cross, to look in America.
Earlier this month, the inspector
general of the Department of Homeland
Security released a report detailing the
inhumane and dangerous overcrowding
of migrants at the El Paso port of
entry, which I had visited. The office
found the overcrowding was ‘‘an imme-
diate risk to the health detainees and
DHS employees.’’
Earlier today, the Senate passed leg-
islation with funding to alleviate some
overcrowding at the CPB facilities and
to provide food supplies and medical
care to migrants. This bill we have
passed also includes critical funding
for the Office of Refugee Resettlement
to care for migrant children.
The House of Representatives passed
their own version of the bill last night.
The House legislation, which I also
support, includes critical oversight
measures, particularly when it comes
to these children. Now it is time for us
to reach an agreement—the House and
the Senate, Democrats and Repub-
licans—and to do it in a timely fashion.
I am willing to work with my col-
leagues to find a bipartisan answer, as
I did on the first version of this, which
passed in the Senate. What is hap-
pening at our border is unacceptable.
The President has to come to realize
that just getting tough is not the an-
swer; it takes more.
We need to commit ourselves to
international assistance in these three
countries that are the sources of these
people: El Salvador, Honduras, and
Guatemala. Overwhelmingly, those are
the origins of these migrants who come
to the United States.
We have to realize, as well, that peo-
ple are coming here in desperate cir-
cumstances, as this photograph I
showed on the floor depicts. Many
times they are prepared to risk their
lives and even lose their lives as they
try to make it to the United States in
desperation. We have to find a way, an
orderly way, to accept those who truly
need our protection and need to be
brought to a place of safety. And we
have to have a timely process so that
the determination of eligibility is not 1
year or 2 years in the future. It is time
for us to work together on a bipartisan
basis to do that.
Mr. President, I see another Senator,
my colleague from Oklahoma, on the
floor. I hope he can give me 10 minutes.
Thank you. I appreciate that.
IRAN
Mr. President, although I may not
often say it, I want to make it clear. I
think President Trump made the right
decision the other day in deciding not
to start a war with Iran. He must ac-
cept responsibility for some of the
challenges we now face.
I think the decision to walk away
from the agreement that prohibited
Iran from developing nuclear weapons
was shortsighted. By every report that
we have received, this agreement—
international agreement—with inter-
national inspectors was being followed
by the Iranians. Yet the President de-
cided to walk away from it. His at-
tempt to isolate Iran from our allies,
to seek regime change, and to declare
economic war on Iran, unfortunately,
have all led to this moment in history
where a confrontation seems immi-
nent.
Many around the President here in
Washington and abroad have been anx-
ious for a conflict with Iran. Many of
the same people were anxious for a con-
flict with Iraq. I remember that. I re-
member it well because I was one of 23
Senators who voted against the inva-
sion of Iraq. They are still there, en-
gaged in a war some 17 years later.
Thousands of American lives have been
lost, and thousands more have been in-
jured. We are spending trillions of dol-
lars in taxpayers’ money in a war with-
out end in Iraq.
One of the great tragedies of the Iraq
war, one of the few its architects have
ever admitted, is that the Iraq war ac-
tually ended up empowering Iran.
Today, the Iraqi Government is actu-
ally something of an Iranian client
state. Yet the same unrepentant voices
are again beating the drums for regime
change and another war in the Middle
East.
Do the American people want a third
war in the Middle East at this moment
in our history? I don’t think so.
Some have even had the audacity to
argue the 2001 authorization for use of
military force approved by this Con-
gress to respond to those who attacked
us on 9/11 somehow gives this President
authority and permission to invade
Iran. I don’t agree with that at all.
I cannot imagine anyone here who
took that vote 18 years ago thought
they were voting to start a war with
Iran that would still be going on 18
years later. I find that impossible to
believe.
The Constitution is clear. Article I,
section 8 says that the power to declare
war is the explicit power of the U.S.
Congress, and it should be.
No one should ever send our sons and
daughters into war without the consent

of the American people through their
elected representatives. Our Founding
Fathers were wise in making sure this
awesome power did not rest with a
King-like or Queen-like figure but with
the people’s elected representatives.
I have made this same argument in
the House and in the Senate during my
career, regardless of who sat in the
White House, a Republican or a Demo-
crat.
Recently, I was pleased to join with
Senator UDALL and others in legisla-
tion reaffirming no war with Iran with-
out the consent of Congress. This bill is
also now an amendment to the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. I
sincerely hope we will have a timely
vote to make sure the President under-
stands that he cannot authorize the in-
vasion or military force in Iran with-
out the approval and permission of
Congress.
Some of the eerie, familiar state-
ments and distortions used to sell the
Iraq war are reappearing now. Vice
President Cheney repeatedly warned us
in those days that Saddam Hussein was
actively pursuing nuclear weapons. He
even alleged there was ‘‘no doubt’’ that
they were amassing those weapons to
use against the United States.
Former Pentagon adviser Richard
Perle argued that Iraqis could finance
the postwar rebuilding from their own
oil wealth, and he had ‘‘no doubt that
they will.’’
President George W. Bush, who
claimed war was actually his last
choice, provocatively tried to link al-
Qaida with Saddam Hussein—a dubious
claim echoed by his then-Secretary of
Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and one
some are even trying to brazenly use
today.
Secretary Rumsfeld even tried to
claim war in Iraq would last ‘‘Five
days or five weeks or five months, but
it certainly isn’t going to last any
longer than that.’’ That is what our
Secretary of Defense said.
Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul
Wolfowitz and Vice President Cheney
said we would be welcomed in Iraq as
liberators. Wolfowitz argued that
‘‘hundreds of thousands of American
troops is way off the mark.’’
Five days or 5 weeks, welcomed by
the Iraqis? Well, the war started, and it
has never ended. There are 150,000
American soldiers deployed in Iraq.
The war continues into its second dec-
ade. Incidentally, no weapons of mass
destruction were ever found, no nuclear
weapons, and we certainly weren’t
greeted as liberators. Iraqi oil did not
pay the $2 trillion that American tax-
payers were forced to pay for that war
in Iraq.
More than 4,500 Americans have been
killed and 32,000 wounded, including
my brave and amazing colleague in the
Senate, Senator TAMMY DUCKWORTH.
How do some of the current occu-
pants of the White House driving Iran
policy feel about that Iraq war dis-
aster? Well, National Security Advisor
John Bolton said in 2015: ‘‘I still think
the decision to overthrow Saddam was
correct.’’ He made that statement 1
month after writing a New York Times
op-ed piece entitled: ‘‘To Stop Iran’s
Bomb, Bomb Iran.’’
Sadly, what I find most stunning
about the administration’s march to
war in Iran is that its actions have, in
fact, contributed to the current mess
and Iran’s threat to restart its nuclear
program.
President Trump has been pursuing a
policy impossible to follow: calling for
a regime change, trying to flatter and
meet with the Iranian President
Rouhani, trying to negotiate a better
deal, threatening Iran militarily, tight-
ening sanctions. Who knows what the
policy is going to be from day to day.
The President impulsively withdrew
from the nuclear agreement without
first designing a credible way to get a
better agreement. He went on to des-
ignate Iran’s military as a terrorist or-
ganization, even against the advice of
our military. And he tried to starve
Iran of the agreed benefits it was to re-
ceive from the original deal.
Let me be clear. There is no doubt
that Iran is responsible for dangerous
destabilizing actions in that region and
beyond. Its proxies attack our service-
members in Iraq and threaten our al-
lies in the region. But why not push
back against Iran without withdrawing
from the nuclear agreement? Why give
them the pretext for belligerence and
undermine our credibility with the
global powers party to our own nuclear
deal?
The tragic end result of this dan-
gerous incoherence is that our allies
are united against us, and Iran may we
start nuclear activities, which had
been frozen for the last 4 years.
This Congress, already a rubberstamp
for too many of President Trump’s in-
stincts, must not do so in a march to
another war in the Middle East as well.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma.
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I
want to rise today to speak to the Sen-
ate and compliment two of my col-
leagues, Senator JIM INHOFE from my
State of Oklahoma, my senior Senator,
and Senator JACK REED, for their lead-
ership and bipartisan work on this
year’s National Defense Authorization
Act for fiscal year 2020.
This is a complicated bill. It has had
hundreds of amendments, both in com-
mittee and in the initial managers’
package that came out of committee
that has already been debated, and
there are a lot more amendments that
are still being debated in the process.
It is an incredibly complicated issue
to bring the authorization and infor-
mation for all military for the next
year. It is something that Congress has
done for a long time. But for JIM
INHOFE, this is his first year to chair
this committee and to actually be the
driver for this, and I think he has done
an exceptional job of walking through
this piece of legislation.
It is a $750 billion authorization.
There will be additional appropriations
that have to be done to be able to des-
ignate that, but that is exactly what
President Trump had asked for and
said is what is needed, and it is what
the Department of Defense has said
that they would need to keep our coun-
try safe and to prepare for the future.
There are a lot of elements in the
bill. I want to identify a few of them,
beginning with a 3.1-percent pay in-
crease for our troops. That is some-
thing that is much needed. The pay for
our troops has been very, very behind
for a long time, and this starts an ini-
tial process of getting them a little bit
above inflation to start trying to catch
up.
It also deals with an issue that is
very important to our military fami-
lies, and that is their housing. There
are many areas and many bases and
posts around the country and around
the world where the housing has fallen
behind: mold issues, plumbing issues,
electrical issues, roofing issues, and
flooring issues. It is important for the
members of our military to have a safe
place that they come home to that
really feels like home. They are trav-
eling around the world. They are in dif-
ficult places, and as much as their fam-
ilies can be kept safe and have a place
that they can make home as a family—
that is exceptionally important. For
those single men and women, it is im-
portant that they have a place where
they can actually get rest and have
connection with each other. This bill
deals with additional funding to deal
with housing, which is much needed.
This bill also deals with spouses, in
their transition from facility to facil-
ity, being able to pick up an additional
job. For many of the spouses who are
traveling with our men and women in
the military, when they move to a new
base or post, they also want to pick up
a new job in that place. It takes
months to do that transition now.
There is also an issue with licensing.
If they have a professional skill in one
State, when they move to another
State, there are some additional hur-
dles for them just to move to that next
State. This bill helps deal with that
and, again, helps those families know
that when they move, as we ask them
to move to different locations, it is a
little bit easier on their family to also
pick up a second job if they choose to
do that.
Oklahoma is home to Altus Air Force
Base, Tinker Air Force Base, Vance Air
Force Base, Fort Sill Army Post,
McAlester Army Ammunition Plant,
and, of course, the amazing facilities
for our Army and Air International
Guard. We have a lot of folks in Okla-
homa who are veterans who come back
to Oklahoma to retire, and a lot of
folks who are actively serving there.
This bill deals with every one of those
facilities in some way.
Let me give a few examples. The KC–
46 tanker—a brandnew tanker that will
be the refueler for the next genera-
tion—has already begun its delivery. It

is coming to Altus, and it is already
there at Altus Air Force Base. In fact,
I had the privilege, along with Senator
INHOFE, to ride in from Seattle on the
very first KC–46 tanker coming to
Altus Air Force Base in the 97th Air
Mobility Wing. That wing does all the
training for every pilot who will fly the
KC–46 for the decades ahead. Whether
they are in the Reserve or in the Guard
or Active Duty, they are going to be
connected to Altus Air Force Base for
the KC–46. It has long been awaited,
and it is finally arriving.
This bill does the authorization for
an additional 15 tankers, as we are
modernizing that force, and we will do
a few every single year for quite a
while.
The bill includes funding for the pro-
curement of critical Army weapons and
combat vehicles, including the Paladin
Integrated Management System up-
grade, which is assembled in Elgin, OK,
right next to Fort Sill. The Fires Cen-
ter of Excellence at Fort Sill organizes,
trains, and equips all the Paladin units
in the Army Paladin Integration Man-
agement. In fact, the skills that are
coming in at Fort Sill Fires Center of
Excellence are asked for all over the
world. Almost every one of our allies
and every single foreign base is asking
for the good folks from Fort Sill who
are trained to help protect our men and
women around the world.
Additionally, Senator INHOFE and
Senator REED and all their staff have
worked to get in some of the amend-
ments that I brought in on the base
text. Those amendments—they heard it
out. We got a chance to have dialogue.
They have now been included long
term.
One of those that I worked with one
of my colleagues on—Senator SHA-
HEEN—we worked on a sense-of-the-
Senate on dealing with Turkey. Turkey
is a NATO ally. They worked very
closely with us in the development of
the F–35, but we have a problem. The
leadership in Turkey is now reaching
out to Russia to buy the S–400 air de-
fense system. The F–35 is incompatible
with the S–400 Russian system sitting
right next to it. We will never ever
allow the F–35 to sit next to the Rus-
sian S–400 system.
We tried to make that clear in mul-
tiple conversations with Turkey and
with Turkey’s leaders. We tried to
bring this up over and over again. I
worked with Senator INHOFE, along
with my colleagues, Senator SHAHEEN
and Senator JACK REED, to make it
clear that we will not allow the F–35 to
be sold to Turkey if they are also going
to purchase the S–400 from Russia.
I maintain my strong support for the
F–35 program and applaud its advanced
capability. The military actually will
be shaped around the F–35 in the days
ahead, based on its capabilities. But we
cannot allow Turkey to have the F–35
and also buy a Russian system at the
same time.
One of my other amendments that I
dealt with when I was dealing with
Turkey and the F–35 and the security
of that advanced weapons system also
dealt with something that some folks
may not have noticed, but I did, and
other folks have as well, and that is
the retirement of chaplains.
We lose track at times that when
people enter into the military, these
mandatory retirement ages will sneak
up on folks. Well, it is especially so for
chaplains because many chaplains ac-
tually enter into their service in the
military after—as a second career. For
many folks in the military, that is
their first career, and then they have a
second one, but not so for chaplains.
Many of them are pastors or mission-
aries or counselors in hospitals and
other locations. They get into their
service and then time out.
Chaplains need a little bit of extra
time to serve so they can serve a full
term with the U.S. military. One of our
amendments in this bill allows those
chaplains to be able to complete serv-
ice and be a part of that.
There are many other aspects of this
bill that is literally hundreds of pages
long that deal with military service. I
want to bring up one additional ele-
ment. It is an element that has been in
great debate in conversation here in
Congress, and it deals with the country
of Iran.
This bill deals with not the military
policy specifically with Iran but deals
with our defense and our preparation
for any enemy, including Iran. There is
an amendment coming up for debate
and conversation that changes the
rules of engagement with Iran, that lit-
erally says to this administration that
they cannot engage in any hostilities
with Iran. They can only defend them-
selves if attacked but cannot respond
until they get a vote from Congress.
I cannot imagine a worse set of rules
of engagement for anyone in the U.S.
military who is forward-deployed and
facing risk from Iran than to say: You
can respond when Congress votes for it.
I will certainly vote against that
amendment, as it comes up as one of
the final amendments, to say to our
military leadership: I will not handcuff
you in the face of the threat that is
Iran.
I have heard folks on this floor and in
the media want to lay the issues we
have with Iran on President Trump.
May I remind this body that we had 444
hostages taken in Iran in 1979. Iran was
the mover that bombed Beirut and our
Embassy there in the 1980s. Iran is the
one that attacked the Khobar Towers
in Saudi Arabia and killed many of our
folks in the 1990s. The reason Bashar
Assad is still in power in Syria right
now is because Iran and their forces
have brought them up. The reason
there is a civil war in Yemen right now
is because Iran is providing the weap-
ons there and the insight to be able to
instigate that civil war that is hap-
pening in Yemen right now. The reason
there is constant peril on Israel’s bor-
ders all the way around is because Iran
is funding Hezbollah and Iran is fund-
ing Hamas.
Iran is the largest state sponsor of
terrorism in the world, and the insta-
bility in the region is not something
new and is not President Trump’s
fault. It has been a long-term issue
with not only the United States but all
of the West and all of the region.
Our issue is not with the Iranian peo-
ple. They are smart. They are entre-
preneurs. They are well educated. But
they also live under the thumb of a
ruthless regime led by the ayatollahs.
That regime squashed the Green Move-
ment several years ago in Iran—the
people just wanting more freedom.
The issues we are facing with Iran
right now are not President Trump’s
fault, are not because he is being mean,
just as Iran’s attack on the Khobar
Towers and the murder of many of our
people was not because President Clin-
ton had put sanctions on Iran the year
before. It wasn’t President Clinton’s
fault that the Khobar Towers were at-
tacked; it is not President Trump’s
fault in this case. He has pushed back
on a terrorist regime and is demanding
that they change their ways not only
in the nuclear setting but also in con-
ventional terrorism around the region
and, quite frankly, around the world.
We cannot allow them to continue to
terrorize their neighbors.
No one wants a war with Iran. That
is why we have used sanctions and dip-
lomatic means to address this. All
these accusations that the President is
secretly going to try to take us to war
with Iran I find absurd, especially for
the man who is trying to get us out of
a war in Afghanistan, out of a war in
Syria, and out of a war in Iraq. Sud-
denly, secretly, he wants to get into a
war with Iran? That is absurd.
All of the region is looking to us to
help push back on the biggest bully in
the region for decades, and every Presi-
dent since Jimmy Carter has tried to
isolate and push back on Iran. I do not
want to suddenly limit President
Trump from trying to isolate and push
back on Iran because some folks don’t
trust him.
In the days ahead, we as a nation will
cautiously, diplomatically, economi-
cally isolate Iran to try to bring them
into cooperation with the rest of the
world, but in the meantime, let’s not
handcuff our folks who are in harm’s
way in that region and tell them: If
you want to respond, come and get a
vote from us first.
In closing, I again thank Senator
INHOFE, who has done tireless work on
this NDAA, and Senator JACK REED for
their great bipartisan leadership on
this. They have done yeomen’s work on
this.
I hope that this bill will not only
pass the Senate but that we will put it
on the President’s desk in the days
ahead and give some stability to our
military forces around the world and
that they will know we understand
that 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, and
in every time zone in the world, they
are standing watch for peace and free-
dom. They are not a threatening pres-
ence. They are a peaceful presence, and

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—AMENDMENT
NO. 900
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I come
to the floor this evening to offer an
amendment about the opioid addiction
crisis that is devastating our Nation.
The origins of this epidemic are no
doubt complicated, but there is a sim-
ple fact within this complicated prob-
lem; that is, the introduction of the
synthetic opioid fentanyl has made
this the deadliest drug epidemic in
American history.
Fentanyl is 30 to 50 times more pow-
erful than heroin, which is obviously
lethal. Just 2 milligrams of this sub-
stance—that is equivalent to a few
grains of salt—is enough to kill most
people. This synthetic opioid has con-
tributed to or caused 30,000 of the 50,000
opioid overdose deaths in the United
States since 2017, and it is killing
Pennsylvanians at an even higher per-
centage.
As is the case with most illicit drugs,
the vast majority of this is not actu-
ally coming from within the borders of
the United States; the vast majority
originates outside our borders. So co-
operation with the governments of
other countries is essential if we are
going to make progress in ending this
scourge.
There are some countries that are ex-
tremely helpful. Canada and Mexico
are, unfortunately, important transit
points for drugs into the United States.
Their governments work closely with
ours and, I think it is fair to say, are
doing all they reasonably can and con-
tinue to strive to do more to end this
devastating influx. But fentanyl is par-
ticularly difficult because such tiny
quantities are so lethal, and the fact is
that not all foreign governments are as
cooperative as they could be and they
should be.
It is well known that the primary
source of the fentanyl that is on the
streets in Pennsylvania and across
America—the source is ultimately
China. China has been cooperating in
some important ways. China shares ad-
vance electronic data on mail parcels,
and that is helpful. As of May 1 of this
year—a few weeks ago—China agreed
to schedule fentanyl as a class that is
prohibited in China, and that forgoes
the need to schedule every conceivable
variant of the chemical. That is a good
development. But we can’t be sure that
China is going to follow through on its
commitment—the one I just mentioned
is very recent—and they still don’t do
all they should on pill presses. They
also have a history of breaking agree-
ments with the United States.
Maybe even more importantly, we
don’t know what other countries might
decide to tolerate fentanyl production
within their borders and look the other
way when it arrives in the United
States.
Simply, there have to be con-
sequences for countries that knowingly
allow the production of fentanyl in
their own land, to then be exported to
the United States, and that do not—I
am referring to the governments—co-
operate with us as fully as they could
and should be.
That brings me to the bill I intro-
duced. It is called the Blocking Deadly
Fentanyl Imports Act. It is a bipar-
tisan bill that I introduced with DOUG
JONES. I want to offer that as an
amendment, to get a vote on this bill
we are considering right now.
I should point out that since 1983,
Congress has utilized the Foreign As-
sistance Act as a way to deal with this
kind of problem. Specifically, this leg-
islation—the Foreign Assistance Act,
the existing law—forbids certain cat-
egories of U.S. foreign aid from going
to countries that don’t assist us suffi-
ciently in our effort to control illicit
substances.
There is a finite number of illicit
drugs that are on the list. They include
heroin, marijuana, cocaine, and meth-
amphetamine and its precursor chemi-
cals. Congress has periodically updated
the list and expanded the list as times
have changed. In 2005, the House and
Senate voted to add methamphetamine
and its precursors. Senator JONES and I
and a number of our colleagues believe
it is past time that we add fentanyl to
this list, especially since it is arguably
the most lethal drug in the world
today.
Our bill would do a couple of things.
It would add fentanyl to this list on
the Foreign Assistance Act, the illicit
substance list. That would then require
the State Department to identify those
countries—at the moment, China—that
are the most significant sources of il-
licit fentanyl and fentanyl analogues.
Then we would toughen the require-
ments in determining whether or not
another country is, in fact, sufficiently
cooperating with the United States. We
only toughen the requirements for
those countries that are found to be
significant sources of fentanyl, not the
other drugs already on the list but
those countries determined by our
State Department to be significant
sources of fentanyl. For that small set
of countries, if the President finds that
one or more of the following three cri-
teria are not being met, then, those
countries would face the risk of having
these forms of financial aid withheld.
These are the three criteria we want
them to meet: No. 1, whether they have
in fact scheduled fentanyl and ana-
logues as a controlled substance in
their country; No. 2, whether steps are
being taken to actually prosecute peo-
ple who are illegally trafficking in
fentanyl; and the final criteria we
would add is whether or not they re-
quire the registration of pill presses,
because we know that unregulated pill
presses have been found to be used for
production of counterfeit pills that ac-
tually contain fentanyl.
That is the criteria that would get a
country crosswise with us as a con-
sequence of this legislation. What
would the consequences be? The legis-
lation contemplates that if a country
is not doing enough with respect to the
existing list of illicit narcotics, then,
they would stand to lose various forms
of foreign aid from the United States,
specifically, economic development
grants, development finance aid, health
aid, agricultural aid, and military aid.
It is important to note there are
other categories of aid that we provide
to foreign countries and more precisely
to entities within those countries that
would not be affected by this. They are
not affected under current law, and
they would not be affected under our
bill—aid such as products-related as-
sistance, disaster relief, food aid, med-
ical aid, and aid to refugees. Existing
law doesn’t interrupt those forms of
aid even with bad-acting governments,
and our bill wouldn’t either. In addi-
tion, even the categories of foreign aid
that could be shut off and that would
be shut off are subject to a Presidential
waiver. If, for whatever reason, the
President believes it is more important
that we continue even those forms of
aid, then, under our amendment, the
President could do so.
Again, to just sum up, the simple
thing here is that a country that know-
ingly tolerates the production and ex-
port of fentanyl and is not as coopera-
tive with our government as they could
be in stopping it shouldn’t be getting
all kinds of U.S. foreign aid. That is
all.
That is what our amendment would
do. The majority on the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee supports
this. The State Department made some
suggestions that we accepted. Some of
the suggestions included that we drop
the reference to precursor chemicals
because that might capture too many
countries that shouldn’t be captured
because they are not the precursor
chemicals used for the purpose of pro-
ducing illicit fentanyl. We acknowl-
edged that, and we changed it.
I would again stress that the waivers
are available to the President in the
event the country ought to get those
waivers.
So let me remind my colleagues that
this is the worst drug crisis in Amer-
ican history. Fentanyl is at the heart
of it. We should hold accountable coun-
tries that are not doing enough to stop
this poison from leaving their country
and coming into ours.
I am not asking for passage here and
now, but I am asking for a vote. Let’s
have an up-or-down vote. I would be
happy to set the vote at a 60-vote
threshold. Let’s send a message to any
country in the world that there will be
consequences for them if they choose
to go down this road.
With that, Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent to set aside amendment
No. 862 and call up my amendment No.
900.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4553
June 26, 2019
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from New Jersey.
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, I agree with
the Senator from Pennsylvania that we
need to fight the opioid epidemic from
every angle.
The trafficking of this drug fentanyl
coming into the United States has to
stop. Many lives are at stake. In my
State of New Jersey, over 3,100 New
Jerseyans died in 2018 alone as a result
of prescription pain killers, heroin, and
fentanyl.
While I support the Senator from
Pennsylvania’s desire to use all of the
leverage we have at our disposal to
pressure China to do a better job at
regulating illicit fentanyl, as is exem-
plified by the amendment I cospon-
sored with Senator SCHUMER and oth-
ers that is in the underlying legislation
we are considering as of now, the Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania’s amendment
could potentially have far more wide-
reaching implications.
I believe every Member of the body
should be concerned about the poten-
tial collateral damage should this be-
come law.
The Trump administration’s State
Department, when we asked them for
an assessment of the original version of
this amendment, concluded that it
would lead to the suspension of U.S.
foreign assistance to every country on
the planet. That is not something I can
support.
When we talk about China, our aid to
China isn’t to China as a nation. China
doesn’t need our aid. It is giving out
aid all over the world. Our aid to China
is to individuals, entities, and organi-
zations that actually promote our na-
tional interests and our national secu-
rity by creating opportunities for dif-
ferent parts of Chinese society to be
independent from the Chinese state. So
it is not China that gets our foreign as-
sistance, but, in large part, that ulti-
mately would be denied, and that is a
type of loss that the Chinese would be
only too happy to see happen.
My office worked extensively
through the weekend with the Senator
from Pennsylvania’s office. We offered
numerous different compromise agree-
ments, but none of them were accept-
able. So while I agree with the spirit of
this amendment, I cannot support it as
it is currently drafted, and therefore I
must object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Pennsylvania.
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, very
briefly, I hope the Senator from New
Jersey will continue to engage with us.
There is a possibility that we are not
as far apart as it may appear.
Let me be very clear. It is an abso-
lute fact that every country in the
world would not be affected by this leg-
islation at all. Whoever at the State
Department suggested that chose not
to read the language or chose not to
understand it. Our legislation would af-
fect a very narrow category of coun-
tries that are determined by our State
Department to be major sources of
fentanyl. At the moment, there is a
grand total of one that I am aware of
that would qualify for that designa-
tion. Nothing else flows from this.
There are no consequences unless you
first meet that criteria. So that alone
makes it obvious that it couldn’t pos-
sibly apply to every country in the
world.
I would also underscore the cat-
egories of aid that would be subject to
being withheld in the event that a
country is, in fact, a source of fentanyl
and is not cooperating with us—our
economic development grants, develop-
ment finance aid, health aid, agricul-
tural aid and military aid are all forms
of aid that I think are entirely reason-
able to withhold. The categories that I
think the Senator from New Jersey is
concerned about we exclude from the
risk of being withheld, because I ac-
knowledged the Senator’s point. There
are categories of foreign aid that don’t
go to foreign governments. They go to
NGOs. They go to folks on the ground
who are actually advancing a cause we
believe in. For instance, there is the
democracy development fund. We
wouldn’t affect that even if a country
is a major source of illicit fentanyl and
not cooperating with us fully. We rec-
ognize that this category of funding
doesn’t help that government. It helps
us with the hope that we could change
that government. I am not convinced
that we are as far apart as it may ap-
pear to be.
I would remind everyone that I am
only seeking a vote. I am not asking
for unanimous consent for the amend-
ment itself. I hope we can get back to
the business of actually debating sub-
stance and voting in this body. Some-
times the minority leader has sug-
gested that we have become a grave-
yard of legislation. Well, I am just pro-
posing that we have a debate and have
a vote. I hope we can get to that.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey.
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, as I
said, we worked all weekend long with
the Senator from Pennsylvania’s office,
and we are happy to continue to work
with him to see if we can come to a
common ground. His original amend-
ment that we were discussing did in-
clude the elimination of democracy
promotion, and that is something that
China would only be too happy to
achieve.
I understand that in this amend-
ment—which I have not had the full op-
portunity, nor my staff, to fully ana-
lyze—he may have excluded that. That
is another step forward. So we are
happy to engage with the Senator and
see if we can come to common ground
beyond today.
My goal, however, is to join the Sen-
ator in punishing countries that are ul-
timately allowing this to happen, but
not to do it in a way that doesn’t pun-
ish the country but actually denies
those whom we are trying to help in-
side of those countries in the pursuit of
our own interests. So if we come to
that point, I hope we can ultimately
come to an agreement.
With that, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania.
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak as in
morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
BORDER SECURITY
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this
evening to speak about the horrific hu-
manitarian crisis at our southern bor-
der—the inhumane and truly des-
picable conditions under which mi-
grants, including children, are being
held by the U.S. Government. Children
are being held for prolonged periods of
time in facilities that are woefully in-
adequate, and that is an understate-
ment.
On my left is a chart with some pic-
tures. I want to walk through each of
these pictures to talk about these chil-
dren by name. Since September of 2018,
these children have died while in
United States Government custody.
I will start at the lower right-hand
corner of the chart as you are facing
the chart: Carlos Hernandez Vasquez,
16 years old; up here on the left top of
the chart, Wilmer Josue Ramirez
Vasquez, 2 years old; Darlyn Cristabel
Cordova-Valle, age 10; Juan de Leon
Gutierrez, right here on the other side
of the chart, just 16 years old; Jakelin
Caal Maquin—many know her name
from the time when she passed away—
just 7 years old; and finally, Felipe
Gomez Alonzo, just 8 years old.
These six deaths occurred in the span
of less than 1 year and are the first
deaths in at least a decade. Mourning
their deaths is not enough. I think we
can at least agree on that. As much as
anyone can mourn their deaths, that is
not enough. We must act in light of
this terrible darkness that these chil-
dren experienced and that their fami-
lies are living with and that our coun-
try is experiencing as well.
In recent weeks we have heard some
of the reporting. There have been re-
ports of children held without adequate
medical attention, without food or
water or sanitation.
Just by way of one searing example,
Warren Binford, a law professor at Wil-
lamette University, who spoke with
children at the Texas facility, said:
Basically, what we saw are dirty children
who are malnourished, who are severely ne-
glected. They are being kept in inhumane
conditions. They are essentially being
warehoused, as many as 300 children in a
cell, with almost no adult supervision.
This is a lawyer who is trained to un-
derstand and to explain these kinds of
conditions. This isn’t some casual ob-
server. This is an expert in her field
who is telling us this. She is not a
Member of Congress. She is not an em-
ployee of the U.S. Government. She is
a lawyer who saw this with her own

eyes—children who are malnourished,
neglected, living in inhumane condi-
tions, warehoused, with 300 children in
a cell with no adult supervision.
This same law professor reported wit-
nessing a 14-year-old—a 14-year-old—
caring for a 2-year-old without a dia-
per, lack of medical care, with flu out-
breaks and lice infestation.
Law Professor Binford said:
It’s the worst conditions I have ever wit-
nessed in several years of doing these inspec-
tions.
That is what a trained professional is
telling us about what is happening in
these conditions.
A Senate colleague of mine talked
about going into a facility where chil-
dren were housed. This is a Senator
with a lot of experience in the Senate.
He said, usually when you walk
through any kind of facility or any
kind of environment in the United
States of America where children are,
you can hear them laughing and play-
ing and having fun—that beautiful
noise of children playing. He said you
couldn’t hear any of it. He talked
about the eerie and disturbing quiet in
that place. There was no noise, no
laughing, no happiness, I guess, is prob-
ably the best way he described it.
Then this one Senator talked about
making eye contact with a child. As
soon as he or she made eye contact, the
child would turn away.
I am sure we have other examples
from colleagues here and in the House
and within our government, but when a
law professor who has been in a lot of
these circumstances tells us this, we
should listen, and we should act.
Another lawyer reported speaking
with young mothers and children—all
of whom were claiming asylum at a
Texas facility. The mother reported a
lack of proper medical care, or clean
clothes, or sufficient cups or baby bot-
tles, forcing reuse and sharing of those
same cups and bottles, as well as moth-
ers wiping their children’s runny noses
or vomit with their own clothes be-
cause they have nothing else—not even
a paper towel—to clean with when they
are experiencing these conditions. This
particular lawyer was quoted in the
Texas Tribune, just in case anyone
wants a source.
These reports of overcrowding and
lack of medical care, sanitation prob-
lems, and lack of food or water are an
abomination. This is not America. It is
not the America we grew up with. It is
not the America we tell the world we
are. We have told the world for genera-
tions that we care about each other;
that we welcome people to our shores
and try to treat them fairly. We can’t
say that when we have these kinds of
insults.
Just imagine the fear a child experi-
ences in these circumstances—the fear
that comes from being alone, the fear
of not having their mother or their fa-
ther or some loved one nearby, in many
circumstances. Some, I guess, might
have an older sibling with them, but
just imagine how frightened they are.
Then, to compound that, they don’t
have basic necessities. I can’t even
imagine the fear.
There is a great hymn in my faith
that talks about being a servant. I will
not go through all the lyrics. The song
is named ‘‘The Servant Song.’’ I will
take the sacredness out of it for pur-
poses of where we are speaking today.
One of the lines of ‘‘The Servant Song’’
says: ‘‘I will hold the . . . light for you
in the night time of your fear.’’
I can’t imagine any other cir-
cumstance that anyone here could de-
scribe to better fit that description—in
the night time of the fear of children
who may have survived, but others, as
this chart depicts, lost their lives be-
cause of failures of our government. A
2-year-old, a 10-year-old, a 7-year-old, a
16-year-old, an 8-year-old, and another
16-year-old who were in government
custody of the United States of Amer-
ica lost their lives. I can’t even begin
to imagine that fear.
We all have to ask ourselves a lot of
questions, but one question we have to
ask ourselves in both Houses of Con-
gress and the administration is, Will
this government be there in the night
time of the fear experienced by these
children or not? It is readily apparent,
from all the reporting month after
month, that we are in no way meeting
that test for too many children. Maybe
some are in better conditions, but
there are a lot of children—I don’t even
know the number. I hope it is only in
the hundreds, but many people believe
it is a lot more than that. There may
be thousands or more who are in the
night time of their fear.
Our government is not only part of
creating the fear, we are doing next to
nothing to alleviate it. We should ask
ourselves, will we be there for them in
the night time of their fear?
The administration’s response to all
of the reporting of this horror has been
an insult to the United States of Amer-
ica. It is an insult to the taxpayers who
send money to the government and
say: Make sure that when a child
comes to our borders, we treat them
humanely; make sure the system
works. It is an insult to our values, of
course.
It is an insult to the proclamations
we make as Americans to the world
that we are a beacon of light for the
world in so many ways. Thank good-
ness we are in some other facets of our
government and of course the lives of
our people. On this issue, we are bring-
ing darkness not only to the lives of
those children, but we are bringing
darkness to the world.
We are less safe as a country when
this happens. We empower people
around the world—very bad actors
around the world—who have been per-
petuating this narrative for genera-
tions that America allows this to hap-
pen. When you do that, you empower
the bad guys to recruit and to marshal
their forces against you. When you
treat children this way, who then lose
their lives in government custody, we
are less safe. It hurts our national se-
curity. It doesn’t just undermine our
values. It is not just immoral. It makes
us less safe. It is a national security
threat as much as it is an insult to our
values or at least the values we claim
to have as a government in the execu-
tive and legislative branches.
This administration has sought to in-
crease family detention. They sought
to relax the standards under which
children are held. The administration
recently canceled English classes, rec-
reational programs, and legal aid for
unaccompanied minors at shelters
across the country.
Recently, an attorney for the Depart-
ment of Justice argued that the gov-
ernment should not be required to give
a detained migrant child—or in this
case children—toothbrushes, or soap,
or towels, or showers, and probably
goes on from there. It is hard to com-
prehend how insulting that is to our
values; how cruel and inhumane that
is. If our government can’t provide
that to a child, how can we call our-
selves a government? How can we say
we have the values that we claim to
have as a government? This person was
a lawyer for the U.S. Government from
the U.S. Department of Justice. A law-
yer said that, not some low-level em-
ployee of some department in the Fed-
eral Government. A lawyer in a court-
room said our government shouldn’t
have to provide toothbrushes or soap or
towels.
We should not be relaxing standards
when, according to the American Acad-
emy of Pediatrics, the Department of
Homeland Security facilities already
don’t meet the basic standards for care
of children in residential settings.
Moreover, the Academy of Pediatrics
stated that detention itself, even for
short periods of time, can cause psy-
chological trauma and induce long-
term mental health risks for children.
I made this point to the administra-
tion months ago; that when you are
setting up your protocols about how to
deal with a child, please consult with
the American Academy of Pediatrics—
which is probably the leading organiza-
tion in the whole country—about how
best to care for a child and what not to
do. I think we should listen to them,
and I hope the administration would
not only be listening to the American
Academy of Pediatrics but would be in-
corporating their expertise and proto-
cols.
Conditions for migrant adults are
also completely unacceptable and an
insult to our values. Last month, the
Department of Homeland Security Of-
fice of the Inspector General issued a
report. This isn’t just a routine report.
I will read the headline: ‘‘Management
Alert—DHS Needs to Address Dan-
gerous Overcrowding Among Single
Adults at El Paso Del Norte Processing
Center.’’ This is a management alert
sent by one part of the government—
not just the executive branch but one
department to the other—the inspector

general to the management of the De-
partment of Homeland Security. That
is how bad it is.
I will read just one line on page 9 of
the report:
Recommendations.
We recommend the Acting Secretary of
DHS:
1. Take immediate steps to alleviate the
overcrowding at the El Paso Del Norte
Bridge Processing Center.
They didn’t say work on it for a cou-
ple of months and try to get something
done. Their own inspector general is
saying take immediate steps.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have at least the body of this
report, if not the attachment, printed
in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
MANAGEMENT ALERT—DHS NEEDS TO AD-
DRESS DANGEROUS OVERCROWDING AMONG
SINGLE ADULTS AT EL PASO DEL NORTE
PROCESSING CENTER (REDACTED)
MAY 30, 2019
Memorandum for: The Honorable Kevin K.
McAleenan, Acting Secretary, Depart-
ment of Homeland Security.
From: John V. Kelly, Acting Inspector Gen-
eral.
Subject: Management Alert—DHS Needs to
Address Dangerous Overcrowding Among
Single Adults at El Paso Del Norte Proc-
essing Center.
For your action is our final management
alert, Management Alert—DHS Needs to Ad-
dress Dangerous Overcrowding Among Single
Adults at El Paso Del Norte Processing Cen-
ter, the purpose of which is to notify you of
urgent issues that require immediate atten-
tion and action. Specifically, we are recom-
mending that the Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) take immediate steps to al-
leviate dangerous overcrowding at the El
Paso Del Norte Processing Center (PDT).
Issuance of this management alert is con-
sistent with our duties under the Inspector
General Act of 1978, as amended, to conduct
inspections and recommend policies to pro-
mote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness
in DHS programs and operations.
We have incorporated the formal com-
ments provided by your office on the draft
management alert and appended them ver-
batim. Your office concurred with the rec-
ommendation we made to alleviate over-
crowding at PDT, but gave a target comple-
tion date of November 30, 2020. Because
DHS’s corrective action is critical to the im-
mediate health and safety needs of detainees,
who cannot continue to be held in standing-
room-only conditions for weeks until addi-
tional tents are constructed, we consider the
recommendation open and unresolved. We
will continue our spot inspections of the
southern border facilities and may revisit El
Paso sector sites to monitor overcrowding.
Consistent with our responsibility under
the Inspector General Act, we will provide
copies of our alert to congressional commit-
tees with oversight and appropriation re-
sponsibility over DHS. We also will post the
alert on our website for public dissemina-
tion.
Please call me with any questions, or your
staff may contact Diana Shaw, Assistant In-
spector General for Special Reviews and
Evaluations, at (202) 981–6000.
BACKGROUND
In May 2019, U.S. Customs and Border Pro-
tection (CBP) and Border Patrol leadership
jointly testified before Congress that they
are experiencing an unprecedented border se-
curity and humanitarian crisis along the
southwest border. According to CBP statis-
tics, the number of southwest border mi-
grant apprehensions during the first seven
months of FY 2019 has in general already sur-
passed that of the total apprehensions for
each of the previous four fiscal years. At the
sector level, El Paso has experienced the
sharpest increase in apprehensions when
comparing the first seven months of FY 2019
to the same period in FY 2018. Table 1 shows
the total number of apprehensions by cat-
egory and the percent increase for the El
Paso sector.

During the week of May 6, 2019, we visited
five Border Patrol stations and two ports of
entry in the El Paso area, including greater
El Paso and eastern New Mexico, as part of
our unannounced spot inspections of CBP
holding facilities. We reviewed compliance
with CBP’s Transport, Escort, Detention and
Search (TEDS) standards, which govern
CBP’s interaction with detained individuals,
and observed dangerous holding conditions
at the El Paso Del Norte Processing Center
(PDT) Border Patrol processing facility, lo-
cated at the Paso Del Norte Bridge, that re-
quire immediate attention. Specifically,
PDT does not have the capacity to hold the
hundreds currently in custody safely, and
has held the majority of its detainees longer
than the 72 hours generally permitted under
the TEDS standards (TEDS 4.1).
OVERCROWDING AND PROLONGED DETENTION AT
THE PDT BORDER PATROL FACILITY PUTS DE-
TAINEES AND DHS PERSONNEL AT RISK
According to PDT Border Patrol proc-
essing facility staff, the facility’s maximum
capacity is 125 detainees. However, on May 7
and 8, 2019, Border Patrol’s custody logs indi-
cated that there were approximately 750 and
900 detainees on site, respectively. TEDS
standards provide that ‘‘under no cir-
cumstances should the maximum [cell] occu-
pancy rate, as set by the fire marshal, be ex-
ceeded’’ (TEDS 4.7). However, we observed
dangerous overcrowding at the facility with
single adults held in cells designed for one-
fifth as many detainees. Specifically, we ob-
served:
a cell with a maximum capacity of 12 held
76 detainees;
a cell with a maximum capacity of 8 held
41 detainees; and
a cell with a maximum capacity of 35 held
155 detainees.
PDT’s seven general cells and three small
isolation cells are unable to accommodate
the number of detainees currently being held
at the processing facility within TEDS
standards. Further limiting available space
is the need to separate detainees with infec-
tious diseases, such as chicken pox, scabies,
and influenza, from each other and from the
general population.
Border Patrol agents told us some of the
detainees had been held in standing-room-
only conditions for days or weeks. According
to Border Patrol’s custody logs, there were
756 detainees on site when we visited PDT on
May 7, 2019. Of those, 502 detainees (66 per-
cent) had been held at PDT for longer than
72 hours, with 33 detainees (4 percent) held
there for more than two weeks. On May 8,
2019, we returned to PDT for another unan-
nounced spot inspection and observed that
some family units and adult females had
been transferred, but overall numbers were
even higher as additional detainees had ar-
rived for processing. According to Border Pa-
trol staff, on May 8, 2019, the total number
on site was approximately 900.
During our visits, we observed the triage of
hundreds of detainees outside in the PDT
parking lot. There were approximately 75
people treated for lice, hundreds of family
units waiting in the tented area to be proc-
essed, and hundreds of detainees in line to
surrender their valuables, such as money and
phones, to DHS staff. Figure 4 depicts some
of the outdoor lines we observed on May 7,
2019, and May 8, 2019. We also observed staff
discarding all other detainee property, such
as backpacks, suitcases, and handbags, in
the nearby dumpster. Border Patrol per-
sonnel told us that these items might be wet,
have bugs, and be muddy, and, therefore, pre-
sented a ‘‘biohazard.’’
We are concerned that overcrowding and
prolonged detention represent an immediate
risk to the health and safety not just of the
detainees, but also DHS agents and officers.
Border Patrol management on site said there
is a high incidence of illness among their
staff. Border Patrol management at PDT and
other sites also raised concerns about em-
ployee morale and that conditions were ele-
vating anxiety and affecting employees’ per-
sonal lives. They noted that some employees
eligible for retirement had accelerated their
retirement dates, while others were consid-
ering alternative employment opportunities.
In addition, Border Patrol management on
site said there is an ongoing concern that
rising tensions among detainees could turn
violent. We observed that staff must enter
crowded cells or move large numbers of de-
tainees for meals, medical care, and cell
cleaning. For example, at the time of our
visit, 140 adult male detainees were crowding
the hallways and common areas of the facil-
ity while their cell was being cleaned. We ob-
served staff having difficulty maneuvering
around this crowd to perform their duties,

and were told that staff feel they have lim-
ited options if detainees decide not to co-
operate.
The overcrowded conditions also com-
plicate efforts to ensure compliance with
TEDS standards. For example, CBP was
struggling to maintain hygienic conditions
in the holding cells. With limited access to
showers and clean clothing, detainees were
wearing soiled clothing for days or weeks.
Although TEDS standards do not require a
change of clothing for adults, Border Patrol
agents said they were nevertheless trying to
obtain clean clothing for adult females be-
cause the lack of clean clothes was ‘‘wearing
down on them.’’ We also observed detainees
standing on toilets in the cells to make room
and gain breathing space, thus limiting ac-
cess to the toilets. Border Patrol agents said
detainees who were not ill were raising med-
ical complaints to obtain temporary release
from the cells, adding to the medical staffs
burden.
DHS NEEDS A COORDINATED APPROACH TO MAN-
AGING LONG-TERM DETENTION DURING SHARP
INCREASE IN APPREHENSIONS
Although CBP headquarters management
has been aware of the situation at PDT for
months and detailed staff to assist with cus-
tody management, DHS has not identified a
process to alleviate issues with overcrowding
at PDT. Within DHS, providing long-term
detention is the responsibility of U.S. Immi-
gration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), not
CBP. El Paso sector Border Patrol manage-
ment said they are able to complete immi-
gration processing for most detainees within
a few days, but have not been able to trans-
fer single adults into ICE custody quickly.
Border Patrol managers at the stations we
visited said they call ICE daily to request de-
tention space for single adults. They said in
some instances ICE officers tell them they
cannot take the detainees. In other in-
stances, ICE initially agrees to take some
adult detainees, but then reverses the deci-
sion.
ICE has the infrastructure to transport and
detain aliens nationwide, but its current
ability to do both of these tasks is also
strained. ICE senior managers stated that
ICE does not currently have sufficient deten-
tion bed space to take all of Border Patrol’s
adult detainees, and explained that Border
Patrol has the authority to decide which de-
tainees are the highest priority to transfer
to ICE custody. ICE managers also stated
that ICE prioritizes requests from CBP over
any other requests for bed space and, when
possible, uses its national transportation
system to fly and transport detainees to
available detention beds.
When we discussed the situation at PDT
with ICE, ICE officials suggested the El Paso
sector could develop a single point of contact
to better prioritize requests for adult deten-
tion beds. They said with individual Border
Patrol stations making requests to ICE, the
highest priority detainees may not be trans-
ferred to ICE. Prioritization could alleviate
the situation at PDT and in the El Paso sec-
tor in the short term, but would not con-
tribute to a coordinated DHS approach to
managing long-term detention during this
sharp increase in border apprehensions.
RECOMMENDATIONS
We recommend the Acting Secretary of
DHS:
1. Take immediate steps to alleviate the
overcrowding at the El Paso Del Norte
Bridge Processing Center (PDT).
DHS MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSE AND OIG
ANALYSIS
DHS management provided written com-
ments on a draft of this alert. We included a
copy of DHS’ management comments in
their entirety in appendix A. We also incor-
porated DHS’ technical comments in the
final alert, as appropriate.
DHS Response to Recommendation #1
Concur. CBP has constructed a 500-person
holding capacity soft-sided structure at El
Paso Station, will construct an additional
tent by July 31, 2019, and will open a Central-
ized Processing Center within 18 months.
CBP will continue to review the number of
migrants in custody at Border Patrol sta-
tions to determine available space and trans-
fer subjects accordingly. The Border Patrol,
through its single point of contact at El
Paso Sector, will continue to communicate
with ICE to improve the migrant transfer
process.
The estimated completion date is Novem-
ber 30, 2020.
OIG Response
We observed conditions at the El Paso Del
Norte Processing Center (PDT) Border Pa-
trol facility that represent an immediate
risk to the health and safety of detainees
and DHS employees. Specifically, Border Pa-
trol agents told us some single adults had
been held in standing-room-only conditions
for days or weeks. Border Patrol manage-
ment on site said there is an ongoing con-
cern that rising tensions among detainees
could turn violent. Dangerous overcrowding
among single adults in PDT requires imme-
diate action.
While we consider the actions outlined in
DHS’ response to be partially responsive to
the recommendation, the recommendation
will remain unresolved and open until DHS
offers an immediate corrective action plan
to address the dangerous overcrowding at
PDT.
APPENDIX A—DHS’S MANAGEMENT COMMENTS
TO THE DRAFT MANAGEMENT ALERT
MAY 28, 2019
Memorandum for: John V. Kelly, Acting In-
spector General
From: Jim H. Crumpacker, CIA, CFE for Di-
rector, Departmental GAO-OIG Liaison
Office.
Subject: Management Response to OIG Draft
Management Alert: ‘‘DHS Needs to Ad-
dress Dangerous Overcrowding Among
Single Adults at El Paso Del Norte Proc-
essing Center (PDT)—For Official Use
Only’’ (Project No. 19–039–SRE-CBP).
Thank you for the opportunity to review
and comment on this draft report. The U.S.
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ap-
preciates the work of the Office of’ Inspector
General (OIG) in planning and conducting its
review and issuing this report.
DHS performs an essential role in securing
our Nation’s borders at and between ports of
entry, and enforces U.S. immigration law
within the interior of the country. U.S. Cus-
toms and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement
(ICE) officers and agents continually uphold
the utmost professionalism while performing
essential border security operations. DHS is
devoted to the care and processing of the in-
dividuals in our custody with the utmost
dignity and respect.
The current situation on the border rep-
resents an acute and worsening crisis. Our
immigration system is not equipped to ac-
commodate a migration pattern like the one
we are experiencing now. Previous patterns—
somewhat predictable in composition and
predicated on seasonal variations—are no
longer the norm, Through April 2019, CBP
enforcement actions along the southwest
border are 84 percent higher than the same
period last fiscal year; this includes a 117
percent increase in U.S. Border Patrol
(USBP) apprehensions. Additionally, the
speed with which illegal migrants are
transiting through Mexico to reach our
southern border is frustrating our best ef-
forts to respond quickly.
The current migration flow and the result-
ing humanitarian crisis are rapidly over-
whelming the ability of the Federal Govern-
ment to respond. In March 2019, CBP encoun-
tered over 103,000 illegal border crossers and
inadmissible aliens. In April 2019, that num-
ber exceeded 109,000—the highest monthly
levels in more than a decade.
DHS has taken steps to ensure an elevated
standard of care in response to the current
humanitarian crisis and has directed addi-
tional personnel and resources to the border.
CBP has constructed a weatherproof and cli-
mate-controlled soft-sided structure in the
El Paso Sector. The structure will allow Bor-
der Patrol agents to expedite, process, and
transport migrants to ICE or the U.S. De-
partment of Health and Human Services. The
structure provides areas for eating, sleeping,
recreation, and personal hygiene for up to
500 people. There are also separate areas for
processing, medical evaluations, bathroom
facilities, laundry, trailers, sleeping mats,
kitchen equipment, personal property stor-
age boxes, office space, television, and lock-
ers.
Additionally, a modular facility that is ca-
pable of holding up to 800 people is projected
to be in use by July 2019. Construction of a
permanent Centralized Processing Center
(CPC) in El Paso is planned to further allevi-
ate overcrowding. The CPC is expected to be
operational in approximately 18 months,
with a holding capacity of approximately
1,800. Congress can also help by working on
targeted solutions to restore integrjty to our
immigration system and remove the incen-
tives for families and children to cross our
border illegally.
The draft report contained one rec-
ommendation, with which the Department
concurs. Attached find our detailed response
to the recommendation. Technical com-
ments were previously provided under sepa-
rate cover.
Again, thank you for the opportunity to
review and comment on this draft report.
Please feel free to contact me if you have
any questions. We look forward to working
with you again in the future.
ATTACHMENT: MANAGEMENT RESPONSE TO
RECOMMENDATION CONTAINED IN 19–039–SRE-CBP
The OIG recommended that the Acting
Secretary of DHS:
Recommendation 1: Take immediate steps
to alleviate the overcrowding at El Paso Del
Norte Processing Center (PDT).
Response: Concur. In an effort to alleviate
the overcrowding at the PDT brought on by
the unprecedented increase in the number of
families and children arriving at the South-
west Border, CBP has implemented a multi-
layered approach.
CBP has constructed a 500 holding capacity
soft-sided structure at El Paso Station that
has been operational since May 2, 2019. CBP
will construct an 800 holding capacity mod-
ular facility at El Paso Station to be oper-
ational by July 31, 2019. In addition, a perma-
nent CPC with a holding capacity of approxi-
mately 1,800 is planned to further alleviate
overcrowding in El Paso. It is scheduled to
be operational within 18 months.
CBP will continue to review the number of
migrants in custody at USBP stations within
El Paso Sector to determine available space
and transfer subjects accordingly. USBP,
through its single point-of-contact at El
Paso Sector, will continue to communicate
with ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Oper-
ations to improve the migrant transfer proc-
ess.
In an effort to supplement staff, CBP will
continue to temporarily detail Border Patrol

Mr. CASEY. This report details dan-
gerous overcrowding for a prolonged
basis at this detention center and the
dangers it creates. According to the re-
port, a facility with maximum capac-
ity of 125 detainees is holding approxi-
mately 900. Some migrants were held
in standing-room-only-conditions for
days or weeks with limited access to
showers or clean clothing. Migrants,
many of whom are asylum seekers,
were observed standing on toilets
themselves to make room and gain
breathing space. These conditions not
only violate Custom and Border Pa-
trol’s transport, escort, detention, and
search standards but are an affront to
our values as a nation. Asylum seekers
who have fled violence and suffered
through an arduous journey should not
be subjected to unhealthy, unsanitary,
unsafe conditions under any cir-
cumstances.
Asylum seekers are coming to our
shores because of violence in their
home countries. Everyone knows this.
This isn’t a theory; it is fact. Hon-
duras, Guatemala, and El Salvador
rank in the top 10 countries in the
world for homicide. Why do we think
they are coming? Would any one of us
journey hundreds or thousands of
miles? I don’t think so.
According to a report issued from
Doctors Without Borders in 2017,
Northern Triangle countries—the coun-
tries I just mentioned—are experi-
encing ‘‘violent displacement, persecu-
tion, sexual violence, and forced repa-
triation akin to the conditions found in
the deadliest armed conflicts in the
world today.’’ That is not some Mem-
ber of Congress just talking.
For asylum seekers, the decision to
move is not a choice; it is a necessity.
The journey can further subject them
to violence, danger, and other abuses
along the way.
Once they arrive at our shores, it is
critical that they are treated with
compassion and human dignity and re-
ceive a fair opportunity to present
their claims.
That is the America that we believe
in. That is the America we were taught
to believe that we are—a nation that
respects human life, human values, and
gives people a fair chance when they
present themselves for asylum.
The only good news that we can re-
port tonight is that the Senate passed
a bill to provide nearly $4.6 billion in
humanitarian aid, including $2.88 bil-
lion to the Office of Refugee Resettle-
ment to care for migrant children and
to help minimize the time they are
held in Federal facilities, in Federal
custody. The House also passed a bill,
which I support. We must quickly con-
ference these bills to provide the need-
ed resources while we also ensure there
are protections for migrants and great-
er accountability and transparency
from DHS to ensure the funds are ap-
propriately spent.
The faster we get this done, the bet-
ter, and maybe we can reduce the like-
lihood that six more children will die
in the next couple of months in the
custody of the U.S. Government.
I end with this note: I talked about
what we are as a nation and what we
believe that we should be and the
standard we are not meeting now. We
must be a nation that respects people
who come to our shores and treats
them with a measure of human dignity
and compassion and fairness.
What we must not be is a nation that
refuses asylum seekers who flee perse-
cution and violence from the murder
capitals of the world. We must not be a
nation that separates children from
their families. We must not be a nation
that gives migrants, including chil-
dren, who are in squalid and inhumane
conditions, no hope of getting out of
that circumstance.
We are, indeed, when we are at our
best, a nation of opportunity, a nation
of immigrants, and, of course, a nation
of laws. It is imperative that we fix our
broken immigration system more
broadly so that it, once again, reflects
these American values.
As we work on a broad response to a
broken immigration system, let us at
least be there for those children in the
nighttime of their fear—No. 1, not to
create that fear and, No. 2, not to per-
petuate it for these children. At a min-
imum, we should make a pledge in our
government to never have six deaths of
children who are in the custody of the
U.S. Government.
I yield the floor.

BUDGETARY ENFORCEMENT
LEVELS
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, section 251
of the Balanced Budget and Emergency
Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA,
establishes statutory limits on discre-
tionary spending and allows for various
adjustments to those limits. In addi-
tion, sections 302 and 314(a) of the Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974 allow the
chairman of the Budget Committee to
establish and make revisions to alloca-
tions, aggregates, and levels consistent
with those adjustments.
The Senate will soon consider S.
Amdt. 901 to H.R. 3401, the Emergency
Supplemental Appropriations for Hu-
manitarian Assistance and Security at
the Southern Border Act, 2019. This
measure provides supplemental appro-
priations to address humanitarian as-
sistance and security at the border.
The measure contains spending that
qualifies for cap adjustments under
current statute.
This measure includes $4,586 million
in budget authority that is designated
as being for emergency purposes pursu-
ant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of
BBEDCA. Of that amount, $145 million
is for spending in the security category
and $4,441 million is for nonsecurity
spending. CBO estimates that this
budget authority will result in $1,048
million in outlays in Fiscal Year 2019.
As a result of the aforementioned
designations, I am revising the budget
authority and outlay allocations to the
Committee on Appropriations by in-
creasing revised security budget au-
thority by $145 million, revised non-

BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish sub-
mit to the Senate the budget
scorekeeping report for June 2019. The
report compares current-law levels of
spending and revenues with the
amounts the Senate agreed to in the
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 BBAl8.
This information is necessary for the
Senate Budget Committee to deter-
mine whether budgetary points of
order lie against pending legislation.
The Republican staff of the Budget
Committee and the Congressional
Budget Office, CBO, prepared this re-
port pursuant to section 308(b) of the
Congressional Budget Act, CBA.
This is my fifth scorekeeping report
this year. My last filing can be found in
the Congressional Record for May 22,
2019. The information included in this
report is current through June 24, 2019.
Since my last filing, Congress has
cleared three pieces of legislation with
significant budgetary effects. The first,
the Additional Supplemental Appro-
priations for Disaster Relief Act, 2019,
P.L. 116–20, provided $19.1 billion in
emergency discretionary appropria-
tions to address recent natural disas-
ters. The second, the Blue Water Navy
Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019, H.R. 299,
increased compensation for certain
veterans and modified veteran home
loan programs. The final bill, the Tax-
payer First Act, H.R. 3151, modified
several rules that govern the organiza-
tion of and operations at the Internal
Revenue Service.
Budget Committee Republican staff
prepared Tables A–C.
Table A gives the amount by which
each Senate authorizing committee ex-
ceeds or is below its allocation for
budget authority and outlays under the
Fiscal Year 2019 enforceable levels fil-
ing required by BBA18. This informa-
tion is used for enforcing committee
allocations pursuant to section 302 of
the CBA. For this reporting period, 9 of
the 16 authorizing committees are not
in compliance with their allocations.
Over the current 10-year enforceable
window, authorizing committees have
increased outlays by a combined $3.6
billion. Of the bills clearing Congress
this reporting period, H.R. 299 added to
the Veterans’ Affairs Committee’s ex-
isting violations, including an increase
in spending of $394 million over the 10-
year window, while H.R. 3151 reduced
spending scoreable to the Finance
Committee by $201 million over the
same time period.
Table B provides the amount by
which the Senate Committee on Appro-
priations is below or exceeds the statu-
tory spending limits. This information
is used to determine points of order re-
lated to the spending caps found in sec-
tions 312 and 314 of the CBA. Appropria-
tions for Fiscal Year 2019, displayed in
this table, show that the Appropria-
tions Committee is compliant with
spending limits for the current fiscal
year. Those limits for regular discre-
tionary spending are $647 billion for ac-
counts in the defense category and $597
billion for accounts in the nondefense
category of spending.
The Fiscal Year 2018 budget resolu-
tion contained points of order limiting
the use of changes in mandatory pro-
grams in appropriations bills, CHIMP.
Table C, which tracks the CHIMP limit
of $15 billion for Fiscal Year 2019,
shows the Appropriations Committee
has enacted $15 billion worth of full-
year CHIMPs for this Fiscal Year.
In addition to the tables provided by
Budget Committee Republican staff, I
am submitting CBO tables, which I will
use to enforce budget totals approved
by Congress.
For Fiscal Year 2019, CBO estimates
that current-law levels are $2.9 billion
above and $3.3 billion below enforceable
levels for budget authority and out-
lays, respectively. Revenues are $426
million below the level assumed in the
budget resolution. These figures re-
main unchanged since the May
Scorekeeping Report, as the appropria-
tion provided in P.L. 116–20 was accom-
panied by a concurrent and equivalent
increase in aggregate spending levels
pursuant to section 314 of the CBA.
This adjustment can be found in the
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD for May 23,
2019. Further, Social Security revenues
are at the levels assumed for Fiscal

Year 2019, while Social Security out-
lays are $4 million above assumed lev-
els for the budget year.
CBO’s report also provides informa-
tion needed to enforce the Senate pay-
as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The PAYGO
scorecard shows deficit increases in
Fiscal Year 2019 of $1,957 million, $427
million revenue loss, $1,530 million out-
lay increase; over the Fiscal Year 2018–
2023 period of $3,412 million, $907 mil-
lion revenue loss, $2,505 million outlay
increase; and over the Fiscal Year 2018–
2028 period of $800 million, $798 million
revenue loss, $2 million outlay in-
crease. During this reporting period,
H.R. 3151 had the effect of reducing
deficits by $37 million over both the
Fiscal Year 2018–2023 and Fiscal Year
2018–2028 periods, while H.R. 299 in-
creased deficits by $76 million and $394
million over the same periods, respec-
tively.
This submission also includes a table
tracking the Senate’s budget enforce-
ment activity on the floor since the en-
forcement filing on May 7, 2018. Since
my last report, no new budgetary
points of order were raised. On May 23,
2019, however, a Senator made a pre-
emptive motion to waive all applicable
points of order against the supple-
mental appropriations bill that would
become P.L. 116–20.
All years in the accompanying tables
are fiscal years.
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables be printed in the
RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

U.S. CONGRESS,
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE,
Washington, DC, June 26, 2019.
Hon. MIKE ENZI,
Chairman, Committee on the Budget,
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: The enclosed report
shows the effects of Congressional action on
the fiscal year 2019 budget and is current
through June 24, 2019. This report is sub-
mitted under section 308(b) and in aid of sec-
tion 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, as
amended.
The estimates of budget authority, out-
lays, and revenues are consistent with the
allocations, aggregates, and other budgetary
levels printed in the Congressional Record on
May 7, 2018, pursuant to section 30103 of the
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (Public Law
115–123).
Since our last letter dated May 22, 2019, the
Congress has cleared and the President has
signed the Additional Supplemental Appro-
priations for Disaster Relief Act, 2019 (Public
Law 116–20). That act has significant effects
on budget authority and outlays in fiscal
year 2019.
Sincerely,
MARK P. HADLEY
(for Phillip L. Swagel, Director.)

a Includes the budgetary effects of legislation enacted by Congress during the 115th Congress.
b Sections 1001–1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255) require that certain funding provided for 2017 through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services—in particular the Food and Drug Administration and
the National Institutes of Health—be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) or the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974
(Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include $771 million in budget authority and $767 million in estimated outlays.
c For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as approved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, current level
does not include those items.

d The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116–5), as amended, extended several immigration programs through February 15, 2019, that would otherwise have expired at the end of fiscal year 2018. The estimated budgetary effects
of those previously enacted extensions are charged to the Committee on Appropriations, and are included in the budgetary effects of P.L. 116–6 shown in the ‘‘Appropriation Legislation’’ portion of this report. In addition, division H of P.L.
116–6 further extended those same programs through the end of fiscal year 2019. Consistent with the language in title III of division H of P.L. 116–6, and at the direction of the Senate Committee on the Budget, the budgetary effects of
extending those immigration programs for the remainder of the fiscal year are charged to the relevant authorizing committees, and are shown in the ‘‘Authorizing Legislation’’ portion of this report.
e Section 30103 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 requires the Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget to publish the aggregate spending and revenue levels for fiscal year 2019; those aggregate levels were first published in
the Congressional Record on May 7, 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also allows the Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget to revise the budgetary aggregates:

NATIONAL DEFENSE
AUTHORIZATION ACT
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the men
and women who serve in our military
are incredible patriots, and the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act,
NDAA, is a vitally important bill the
Senate passes every year to ensure our
servicemembers are trained, equipped,
and ready for the global threats our
Nation faces. To this end, investing in
our ready and all-volunteer force to en-
sure we maintain a military competi-
tive advantage is crucial. I would like
to highlight three amendments that I
have introduced to enhance the fiscal
year 2020 NDAA.
My first amendment addresses an in-
creasing concern regarding deaths and
injuries related to military training.
Our men and women in uniform volun-
teer to serve in a profession that car-
ries a great deal of inherent risk and
can demand great sacrifice. Many have
paid the ultimate sacrifice with their
lives upon the fields of battle. Unfortu-
nately, many have also died while
training for battle. To ensure that our
soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines
are the best fighting force in the world,
our military necessarily exercises
them in demanding and realistic train-
ing. Effective military training builds
readiness, tactical proficiency. and
competence, and increases the con-
fidence of our military force to win
wars. I am concerned, however, that,
under the guise of ‘‘realistic training,’’
the military is assuming unnecessary
risk that has resulted in an alarming
increase in servicemembers’ training-
related deaths.
In the past 9 weeks alone, six soldiers
and marines have been killed in mili-
tary vehicle rollover accidents during
training; an additional 34 service mem-
bers have been injured. One of those
killed on May 9, 2019, was my con-
stituent from Chestertown, MD, 24-
year-old Marine 1LT, Hugh Conor
McDowell, when his light armored ve-
hicle rolled over during a military
training event at Camp Pendleton, CA.
Since 2015, noncombat deaths have
exceeded the number of military mem-
bers killed in action every year. A 2018
House Armed Services Committee Re-
port stated, ‘‘In 2017, nearly four times
as many members of the military died
in training accidents as were killed in
combat. In all, 21 Service members died
in combat while 80 died as a result of
non-combat training-related acci-
dents.’’ Training accidents are occur-
ring across the spectrum of military
platforms, military aviation incidents
rose nearly 40 percent from 2013 to 2017.
resulting in 133 military deaths; in
2017, 17 sailors were killed in two sepa-
rate naval ship collisions. Three of
those who died were also Maryland
residents.
Something needs to change in the
military’s current culture of training
safety, and the most recent losses of
life reflect that the current culture is
increasing risk, not reducing it. When
military training yields nearly four
times the casualties compared to com-
bat, training is no longer realistic, it is
unsafe. These training accidents are re-
sulting in the unnecessary death and
injury of our servicmembers and are se-
verely degrading our military readi-
ness. No justifiable reason exists for
training that assumes unnecessary risk
and disregards the safety of our men
and women in uniform. This worrisome
trendline since 2015 demands a serious
examination of military training safe-
ty and implementation of associated
corrective actions across the entire De-
partment of Defense.
I have filed an amendment to the
NDAA, which I hope the Senate will
consider, that would require the De-
partment of Defense to conduct a study
that analyzes the recent training
deaths of servicemembers; provides an
assessment of the associated trends, in-
cluding vehicle rollovers; and demands
recommendations for actions to pre-
vent or minimize such deaths and inju-
ries in the future. This report would be
due to Congress no later than 180 days
after the enactment of the NDAA. We
owe it to the individuals who volunteer
to serve, and their families, to improve
the military’s culture of training safe-
ty and prevent unnecessary deaths and
injuries from occurring in training en-
vironments.
Another important aspect of the
NDAA is to ensure that our military is
investing in modernization and innova-
tion to preserve our strategic competi-
tive advantage against our adversaries.
I was pleased that Senators Inhofe and
Reed have included two of my amend-
ments in division E, the so-called man-
agers’ package of amendments to the
substitute amendment to the under-
lying bill. My two amendments focus
on preserving and bolstering mod-
ernization and innovation.
One of these amendments seeks to
maintain the Nation’s technological
superiority in energetics research and
development. Energetics plays a crit-
ical role in our national security in en-
hancing propulsion and ordnance sys-
tems’ effectiveness in terms ofreach,
accuracy, and lethality. Other nations,
such as China and Russia, continue to
make strides in energetic material de-
velopment, and the U.S. cannot afford
to fall behind. My amendment would
require the Department of Defense to
develop an energetics research and de-
velopment plan to ensure a long-term,
multidomain research, development,
prototyping, and experimentations ef-
fort, which will have the additional
benefit of maintaining a robust defense
industrial base and trained workforce.
It also requires the Secretary to work
in conjunction with DOD Research
Labs, labs such as the Naval Surface
Warfare Center at Indian Head, MD. In-
dian Head is one of the premier re-
search and development facilities for
energetics. The DOD would be required
to brief the relevant congressional De-
fense committees on this plan within a
year of the NDAA’s enactment into
law.
My other amendment seeks to pre-
serve funding and staffing of Army
medical research and development ef-
forts. The Department of Defense and
the Army’s medical research and devel-
opment efforts are critical to increase
warfighter readiness through improv-
ing health protection and resilience,
improving health delivery in deployed
areas, and enhancing the recovery and
rehabilitation of our wounded
servicemembers.
The Army’s medical research and de-
velopment has played a key role for the
Department of Defense, executing over
78 percent of DO D’s medical research,
development, testing, and evaluation
funding. I am proud to say that the
majority of this work runs through Ft.
Detrick, MD, often in partnership with
the medical research programs at
John’s Hopkins, the University of
Maryland, and the Kennedy Krieger In-
stitute. The Army’s medical research
efforts have addressed medical issues
unique to the military, which private
industry and academia have lacked in-
terest in conducting. Some examples
include blast injuries, brain trauma,
and endemic diseases across the globe
that our military has mobilized to ad-
dress, such as the Ebola outbreak in

Liberia. We need to ensure that in ad-
dition to investing in next generation
weapons to deter or destroy our adver-
saries, the Department of Defense is
preserving research and development
resourcing for next generation medical
solutions that protect and save the
lives of our servicemen and women.
Readiness, modernization, and inno-
vation are key pillars of the; fiscal
year 2020 NDAA; my three amendments
strengthen those focus areas by ensur-
ing our servicemembers are receiving
realistic but safe training, are sup-
ported by weapons that are enhanced
by energetic materials, and are pro-
tected and treated by world-class mili-
tary medical solutions during their
training and deployments. Our
servicemembers deserve the best, and
our national security requires that we
maintain our competitive advantage.
Let us ensure the fiscal year 2020
NDAA incorporates the training safety,
technological innovation, and contin-
ued development of medical solutions
required to do so.
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that at its next printing,
the name of the Senator from Texas,
Mr. CRUZ, be added as cosponsor to S.
663 to S. 1790, to authorize appropria-
tions for fiscal year 2020 for military
activities of the Department of De-
fense, for military construction, and
for defense activities of the Depart-
ment of Energy, to prescribe military
personnel strengths for such fiscal
year, and for other purposes.

EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL AP-
PROPRIATIONS FOR HUMANI-
TARIAN ASSISTANCE AND SECU-
RITY AT THE SOUTHERN BOR-
DER ACT
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President,
this morning, Americans woke up to a
picture of a 25-year-old father lying
facedown, holding his infant daughter.
They both drowned crossing the Rio
Grande River. The border policies im-
plemented by this administration have
life or death consequences. Congress
should be doing everything in its power
to make sure that our southern border
is safe and secure and that asylum
seekers are treated with dignity and
respect.
I share the horror of my constituents
in Maryland about the squalid and in-
humane conditions in which children
are being held at the border. We have
an obligation to provide resources to
ensure the safety of these children, but
this administration has demonstrated
only callousness towards migrants
seeking asylum at our border, and we
have an obligation as a coequal branch
of government with the power of the
purse to ensure that the resources we
provide are spent responsibly and de-
liver real care. While I appreciate the
guardrails that Senators LEAHY and
SHELBY negotiated in this bill, I believe
that the House-passed package has
stronger restrictions that will better
protect children and families at the
border.
Also, as I said to my colleagues when
we marked up this bill, I have serious
concerns with this administration’s re-
peated practice of transferring funding
from the purpose that we appropriate
to meet its own ends. Today, a group of
constituents stopped by my office seek-
ing reassurance that this funding
would not be used for interior enforce-
ment. They were understandably fear-
ful of the President’s threats of wide-
spread raids and mass deportations.
While this bill prohibits transfers with-
in DHS on this supplemental funding, I
cannot fully reassure my constituents
because the administration could still
transfer other FY19 funds to support
its draconian immigration agenda.
I have visited the border, and I have
seen the tragedy the President’s poli-
cies have created there. His family sep-
aration policy is a dark mark on our
Nation’s history. His Justice Depart-
ment has argued that toothbrushes,
soap, and even sleep are not necessary
for the well-being of children. It is
clear that Congress cannot simply
trust this administration to do the
right thing.
I urge my colleagues to work to in-
clude the stronger House-passed re-
strictions to protect children’s safety
and to strengthen restrictions on re-
programming as we continue our ap-
propriations process.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
RECOGNIZING ALL TIME TOYS
∑ Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, it is
with great pride that I name All Time
Toys of Eldersburg, MD, the U.S. Sen-
ate Small Business of the Week.
All Time’s story and that of its
owner Jason Barnes is one of persever-
ance. That is because All Time has re-
covered from two 1,000–year flood
events in less than 18 months.
On July 31, 2016, less than 2 months
after Jason purchased All Time, 75 per-
cent of his inventory was destroyed by
a historic, fatal flash flood that washed
through Ellicott City, leaving millions
of dollars’ worth of damage in its wake.
Within hours, countless videos of the
destructive torrent rushing down Main
Street were being shared on social
media and on the news. One of those
videos was of Jason leading a human
chain to rescue a woman trapped in her
car. Jason’s selfless act has been seen
by millions of people around the globe,
and it earned him an award from the
Carnegie Hero Fund. When asked about
his act of heroism, Jason said that he
‘‘just wanted to help any way’’ he could
and that he could not ‘‘just stand idly
by.’’
After the waters receded, Jason had
to figure out how he would move for-
ward. Thanks to his persistence, and
with support from the Maryland Small
Business Development Center,—
SBDC—All Time reopened less than 6
months later on January 20, 2017; 2017
was a very successful year for Jason
and All Time. The company’s sales
doubled, it drastically improved its
business practices and systems, and
Jason was scouting locations for a sec-
ond store.
Then on May 27, 2018, less than 2
years after the 2016 flood and less than
18 months after All Time reopened,
Ellicott City was devastated again by
another historic flash flood. This time,
however, Jason was prepared with a
readiness plan and the business con-
tinuity strategies he learned from the
Maryland SBDC.
According to FEMA, 40 percent of
small businesses that go through a
major disaster never open their doors
again, and given that Jason was a
brand-new entrepreneur who had lost
the vast majority of his stock, to say
that All Time beat the odds would be
an understatement.
Jason’s story is why the Small Busi-
ness Committee invited him to provide
testimony during our hearing on the
Small Business Administration’s Office
of Disaster Assistance. In his deeply
moving testimony, Jason made clear
that his recovery would not have been
possible without support from SBA, the
Maryland SBDC, and its two secret
weapons: Maryland SBDC consultants
Craig Panos and Garrett Clover, whose
advice and knowledge Jason called mi-
raculous during the hearing.
For too many small businesses, a
major natural disaster marks the end
of a dream, but for Jason and All Time,
surviving two historic floods has
opened up a new chapter defined by re-
silience and persistence. He recently
reopened All Time in nearby
Eldersburg, MD, and he is once again
scouting locations for a second store.
I am proud of Jason’s Free State per-
severance, and I am honored to recog-
nize him and his entire team at All
Time Toys as the Senate Small Busi-
ness of the Week. I look forward to
watching their continued growth and
success.∑

REMEMBERING REBA JOY
HONAKER
∑ Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, today I wish
to honor a proud West Virginian, a dedicated
public servant, a beloved wife, mother, grand-
mother, and a dear friend to all who had the
pleasure of knowing her. It is a privilege to
recognize the life and legacy of Mayor Reba
Joy Honaker for her many years of dedicated
service to the city of Welch and to our home
State.
A lifelong resident of McDowell County,
growing up on Belcher Mountain, Mayor
Honaker graduated from Welch High School
and Concord College and was also a dedi-
cated member of the Elkhorn Old Regular
Baptist Church. Upon graduating from college,
she taught home economics at Big Creek High
School until the birth of her son. Later she
began directing weddings and designing wed-
ding cakes, a skill she taught to others. She
was active with the American Association of
University Women’s McDowell Chapter, where
she took the lead on the yearly arts and crafts
festival with proceeds benefitting the advance-
ment of women in higher education. In 1984,

Mayor Honaker opened Flowers by Reba, a
small business she owned and operated until
2006. Her volunteerism spanned the commu-
nity, from helping to start the very successful
Coal Camp Creations Company, to volun-
teering with the McDowell County Chamber of
Commerce at various festivals and events.
Mayor Honaker truly wanted the very best for
McDowell County, helping to recreate events
that took place in other areas of the State.
She assumed her role as mayor of Welch in
2011 and was able to put her vision for the
community to even greater use. Whether
working with the Welch Kiwanis Club or the
American Legion Post 8 Ladies Auxiliary, she
was able to make a tremendous impact on the
lives of countless families in the area. Most re-
cently, we celebrated the opening of the Jack
Caffrey Arts Center, a project near and dear to
Mayor Honaker’s heart that serves as a hub
for cultural programs in McDowell County.
Mayor Honaker represented the very best of
West Virginia, which is saying quite a lot. In
the Mountain State, if you are hungry, you will
be fed. If you are lost, someone will not only
give you directions but will offer to drive you
to your destination. That is just who we are,
and that is who Mayor Honaker was. We have
lost a shining star in McDowell County, but her
impact, vision, and her passion for this special
community will last forever. It was an honor to
have known her and to call her a friend.
What is most important is that she lived a
full life, surrounded by dear friends and family.
It is my hope that her family and friends are
able to find peace, strength, and support in
one another. I extend my condolences to
Charles, her loving husband of 57 years; her
children, Darren and Patty, and Joi and Jer-
emy; her grandchildren, Christopher, Erik,
Mason, Wyatt, and Paige; and her numerous
extended family members and dear friends
with the city of Welch. Again, I extend to you
my most sincere condolences for our loss of
this wonderful person. The unwavering love
she had for her family, friends, community,
and our home State will live on forever in the
hearts of all who knew her.∑

75TH ANNIVERSARY OF HARPERS
FERRY NATIONAL HISTORICAL
PARK
∑ Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, today
I wish to honor the 75th anniversary of
Harpers Ferry National Historical
Park as a part of the National Park
Service.
It is no secret that my home State of
West Virginia is one of the most natu-
rally beautiful States in the Nation. As
a native West Virginian and an outdoor
enthusiast, I know just how important
our wild and wonderful outdoor herit-
age is to our great State. Our sparkling
rivers, sweeping valleys, and majestic
mountains make our small State a true
gem and beckon sports and outdoor en-
thusiasts from all over the world. It is
vital to the Mountain State that the
natural beauty of our home State is
protected and that we consistently
strive to promote our endless tourism
opportunities.
For more than a century, the Na-
tional Park Service has played a major
role in this success by engaging com-
munities through recreation, conserva-
tion, and historic preservation pro-
grams. To name just one significant
contribution, the National Park Serv-
ice has been working with the Fish and
Wildlife Service and other experts and
volunteers to help protect peregrine
falcons and reintroduce them to the
area. The use of DDT as a pesticide had
all but caused the extinction of the
species. Since the ban of DDT in the
1970s, the population of peregrine fal-
cons have recovered significantly to
due extensive conservation efforts. I
am so deeply proud of what our citizens
have accomplished and what they will
continue to accomplish to preserve our
forests, rivers, wildlife, and historic
sites in the days and years ahead.
Harpers Ferry, itself, has been a loca-
tion that has greatly influenced our
Nation’s history. This community saw
the arrival of the first successful Amer-
ican railroad, was the site of John
Brown’s raid on the Harpers Ferry Ar-
mory, saw the largest surrender of Fed-
eral troops during the Civil War, and
was among the first locations to sup-
port the education of former slaves in
one of the earliest integrated schools
in the United States. It was of such sig-
nificance that it changed hands seven
times during the Civil War.
Visiting this historic community is
like stepping into the past. Whether
visiting the park, strolling through the
picturesque streets, visiting museums
and battlefields, or hiking the trails, it
reflects the West Virginia heritage and
principles you just can’t find anywhere
else in the world. All of Harpers Fer-
ry’s features collectively make it one
of West Virginia’s most treasured des-
tinations. Of course, even more special
than our national historical monu-
ments are the people who take such
pride in maintaining the knowledge of
our history and traditions and pre-
serving the locations and commonsense
values we hold dear.
Harpers Ferry National Historical
Park is treasured in the hearts of all
West Virginians as a statewide commu-
nity and beyond, and it is a privilege to
recognize its 75th year in the National
Park Service.∑

RECOGNIZING MOUNT ST. JOSEPH
UNIVERSITY
∑ Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today
I wish to recognize Mount St. Joseph
University on its 100th anniversary of
service to higher education.
Since 1920, Mount St. Joseph Univer-
sity has stood the test of time as an in-
stitution of higher education in Great-
er Cincinnati, grounded in the spiritual
values and vision of its founders, the
Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati. As the
Mount approaches its centennial in
2020, it remains on a mission—to edu-
cate students, build better commu-
nities, and to serve the common good.
Mount St. Joseph University enrolls
2,168 undergraduate, graduate, and doc-
toral students. The majority of Mount
graduates—i.e. more than 13,000 of the
16,600 living alumni—stay in the Cin-
cinnati region to pursue their careers
and to raise their families, contrib-
uting to the overall success of this re-
gion.
The Mount also serves a diverse pop-
ulation. Over 31 percent of students are
first generation, 23 percent represent
minority populations, and 100 percent
receive financial assistance through
scholarships and financial aid. About 48
percent of Mount students are from
families in the low or moderate income
levels.
Students at the Mount pursue studies
in 39 undergraduate degree programs, 6
master’s degree programs, and 2 doc-
toral programs. As a result of the aca-
demic excellence and career focus of
the university, more than 98 percent of
Mount students are successful in start-
ing their careers, securing significant
volunteer opportunities and obtaining
admission to graduate programs within
6 months of graduating.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mr. MERKLEY:
S. 1987. A bill to require the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services
to establish reference prices for pre-
scription drugs for purposes of Federal
health programs, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Health,
Education, Labor, and Pensions.
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, the
three most important words of our
Constitution are the first three: ‘‘We
the People.’’ That is what our entire
vision of our form of government is
about.
There was a lot of discussion among
the Founders about how we make sure
we don’t end up with the equivalent of
a King here in the United States of
America because with a King, you get
a government by and for the King and
the King’s circle, the powerful circle at
the top, rather than the people.
Unfortunately, that vision in Amer-
ica is being challenged—challenged be-
cause we have a fundamental con-
centration of power through dark
money in campaigns and gerry-
mandering through voter suppression
and intimidation. The result is a shred-
ding of the vision of our Constitution.
We have a responsibility in the Sen-
ate to fix that, and that is why we
should be considering the For the Peo-
ple Act that takes on gerrymandering,
voter suppression, and dark money. If
we want evidence of just exactly how
corrupted the system has become, go
no further than to look at drug compa-
nies gouging Americans on drug prices.
Today I am introducing the End
Price Gouging for Medications Act to
stop the pharmaceutical companies’
greed and give Americans much needed
relief.
The average American spends about
$1,000 per year on medication. That is
11 times what they spent in 1960. More
than half of Americans take at least
one prescription medication—about 60
percent of us. One-quarter of them say
they or family members have not filled
a prescription or have cut pills in half
or have skipped doses because of the
cost, and those costs just keep going
right on up.
January through June 2018, there
were price increases on 4,412 drugs and
decreases on just 46. That is a ratio
that approaches 100 to 1. For every 100
drugs that go up in price, 1 comes down
a little. We are clearly failing to tackle
this problem.
I hear it from my constituents back
in Oregon. Bonnie Davis from Creswell,
who is a senior citizen on a fixed in-
come and has been diabetic for 30
years, was prescribed two new kinds of
insulin in December: BYDUREON,
which costs $1,927 for a 3-month supply,
and Lantus SoloSTAR, which costs
$1,952. She will pay more than $5,000
out of pocket by the end of the year. In
1972, insulin cost just $1.49 per vial.
What an incredible difference on a
product that has been around forever.
Her two adult children are living in
Germany. They thought about coming
back to the United States of America
but decided not to for one simple rea-
son: the cost of healthcare in the
United States of America and specifi-
cally the cost of medications.
I come from Douglas County, a little
timber county in Southern Oregon.
Leslie Rogers comes from that county.
She comes from Roseburg, a town
where I went to first grade. Leslie
shared his daughter Gloria’s story at
one of my townhalls. Gloria suffers
from a rare genetic condition called
West syndrome. She lives, therefore, in
near constant fear of seizures and cys-
tic fibrosis. It is treatable.
It is treatable with a drug called
ACTH. It was invented in the 1950s.
Previously, it cost $40 a vial—$40—but
in 8 years, the cost has grown to
$45,000. Yes, you heard that right—from
$40 to $45,000. That is more than a thou-
sandfold increase.
The company that makes the drug
bought the rights to and blocked a $200
synthetic ACTH treatment used in
Canada to prevent it from coming to
the United States. They are making a
lot of money by blocking a generic syn-
thetic competitor.
Leslie Rogers says: ‘‘Hospitalization
and treatment drove my family to the
edge of bankruptcy, and my daughter
was left tube fed and suction dependent
due to treatment delays fighting with
insurance over the drug price.’’
How would you feel if your daughter
or your son were left in a situation of
being tube fed and suction dependent
because you couldn’t afford the drug
because the drug had increased in price
1,000 times?
The cost of another drug used to
treat the disease, Vigabatrin, has also
skyrocketed after makers saw what the
first company was able to get away
with. It cost about $1,500 a month 3

years ago, and $1,500 is a lot. How much
does it cost today? It costs $26,000 per
month. That is roughly a twentyfold
increase.
Leslie Rogers notes: ‘‘This price
gouging has led to thousands of chil-
dren since we first spoke to suffer the
same fate as my daughter—severe
brain damage, cerebral palsy, reliance
on tube feedings, and many have died.’’
Let’s be clear. Price gouging in
America isn’t just about the pocket-
book; it is about health, and it is about
life or death for many people.
This situation doesn’t exist in other
countries. The whole entire price re-
gime is different. Let’s take, as an ex-
ample, HUMIRA, a common drug for
rheumatoid arthritis. Here in the
United States, it is about $2,700 per
dose. In the United Kingdom, it is
$1,362. Why does it cost twice that in
the United States of America for this
drug, this common drug? Then there is
CRESTOR, which is used to treat high
cholesterol? It is $216 in the United
States, and it is $32 in France. Crudely,
that is a sevenfold increase in the
United States over France. Why do we
pay seven times as much as the people
in France? There is also HARVONI that
is used to treat hepatitis C. It cost
$13,000 in Japan and $30,000 in United
States. That is three times as much.
Why do we pay three times what they
pay in Japan for this drug? There is
also JANUVIA that is used to treat
type 2 diabetes. It costs $34 in Aus-
tralia and $331 in the United States of
America—a tenfold increase. Why do
we pay 10 times as much as people in
Australia?
There is an answer to the question—
the question of why we pay so much for
HUMIRA, for CRESTOR, for HARVONI,
and for JANUVIA. Very simply, other
governments negotiate the price: If you
want to sell it in our country, we nego-
tiate the price.
We don’t. Now, what is the reason
why we don’t? Why don’t we pick up
and do for Americans what the Govern-
ment of Australia does for Australians,
or the Government of the United King-
dom does for its citizens, or the Gov-
ernment of France does for their citi-
zens? Why don’t we do it for our citi-
zens—the same good work in negoti-
ating the price that other governments
do? What is wrong with our govern-
ment? What is wrong with this Cham-
ber?
It is corruption. It is the absolute
corruption of money in campaigns.
So who are we serving here in this
Chamber? Are we serving the people or
are we serving the drug companies?
That is the question every Member of
this Chamber should struggle with.
In the United States, drug companies
set the price, and we don’t negotiate.
In fact, the U.S. Government has set a
law saying the U.S. Government can’t
negotiate. Why would we do that? Why
would we do that to ourselves? Why
would we do that to the people of this
country who cannot afford the drugs
because we make them far more expen-
sive than anywhere else in the world?
Well, we shouldn’t. That is why I
have introduced the End Price Gouging
for Medications Act. On behalf of the
people of America, we need to end the
drug gouging.
Now, I do a lot of townhalls. I do one
in every county every year. There are
36 counties in Oregon. It is open hour
for people to ask questions. They are
blue counties, and they are red coun-
ties. Twenty-two of my 36 are about as
red as the reddest counties you will
find in America.
I ask the people: How many people
here at this townhall like getting
gouged on drugs? Nobody does. How
many people like paying 2 or 5 or 10
times more than the citizens of other
developed countries? No one likes it.
America is united—rural America,
urban America, blue America, red
America, young America, old America.
America is united to end this drug
gouging.
So why don’t we act?
I challenge my colleagues: Come here
and work for the people of the United
States of America rather than the drug
companies’ profits. It is time to stand
up. Stand up against those companies.
This plan is quite simple. It says you
can’t sell the drug for more than the
median price of what you sell it for in
Australia, Japan, Canada, and the larg-
est European countries. It is that sim-
ple. Median price in those markets. If
you want to raise your prices in Amer-
ica, you have to raise your prices in
those countries. That way we all get a
fair deal. This would stop the drug
gouging of Americans overnight.
This is quite simple, but you may ask
how is it enforced? How do you make
sure that this happens?
Well, it is this. The difference be-
tween the reference price, or the me-
dian price in those countries, and the
price the drug company sells their
product at—if they sell it for more
than the median price, the penalty is
five times the difference. If they sell it
for $1,000 more per dose over the me-
dian price, the penalty is $5,000. That
gets people’s attention. Drug compa-
nies don’t want to be paying massive
penalties.
And where do the fines go? They go
to the NIH for drug research and devel-
opment. There is all this myth that we
are not going to invest in drug develop-
ment. The basic science is done by NIH,
and this would fund NIH.
Americans have been ripped off.
Americans have been gouged, and it is
this Chamber that is allowing it to
happen. Who here wants to come and
say they are for the drug gouging of
Americans?
Well, I can tell you that America is
not with you if you are supporting the
drug gouging of our citizens. So let’s
have the courage to carry the fight for
the people, not the powerful.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4571
June 26, 2019
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—
(1) the safety of the food supply of the
United States is vital to the public health, to
public confidence in the food supply, and to
the success of the food sector of the Nation’s
economy;
(2) lapses in the protection of the food sup-
ply and loss of public confidence in food safe-
ty are damaging to consumers and the food
industry, and place a burden on interstate
commerce;
(3) the safety and security of the food sup-
ply requires an integrated, systemwide ap-
proach to preventing foodborne illness, a
thorough and broad-based approach to basic
and applied research, and intensive, effec-
tive, and efficient management of the Na-
tion’s food safety program;
(4) the task of preserving the safety of the
food supply of the United States faces tre-
mendous pressures with regard to—
(A) emerging pathogens and other con-
taminants and the ability to detect all forms
of contamination;
(B) an aging and immune-compromised
population, with a growing number of people
at high risk for foodborne illnesses, includ-
ing infants and children;
(C) a concern regarding food fraud for eco-
nomic gain, especially with mislabeling and
intentionally misleading claims;
(D) an increasing volume of imported food,
without adequate monitoring and inspection;
and
(E) maintenance of rigorous inspection of
the domestic food processing and food serv-
ice industries;
(5) Federal food safety standard setting, in-
spection, enforcement, and research efforts
should be based on the best available science
and public health considerations and food
safety resources should be systematically de-
ployed in ways that most effectively prevent
foodborne illness;
(6) the Federal food safety system is frag-
mented, with at least 15 Federal agencies
sharing responsibility for food safety, and
operates under laws that do not reflect cur-
rent conditions in the food system or current
scientific knowledge about the cause and
prevention of foodborne illness;
(7) the fragmented Federal food safety sys-
tem and outdated laws preclude an inte-
grated, systemwide approach to preventing
foodborne illness, to the effective and effi-
cient operation of the Nation’s food safety
program, and to the most beneficial deploy-
ment of food safety resources;
(8) the National Academy of Sciences rec-
ommended in the report ‘‘Ensuring Safe
Food from Production to Consumption’’ that
Congress establish by statute a unified and
central framework for managing Federal
food safety programs, and recommended
modifying Federal statutes so that inspec-
tion, enforcement, and research efforts are
based on scientifically supportable assess-
ments of risks to public health; and
(9) the lack of a single focal point for food
safety leadership in the United States under-
cuts the ability of the United States to exert
food safety leadership internationally, which
is detrimental to the public health and the
international trade interests of the United
States.
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act
are—
(1) to establish a single agency to be
known as the ‘‘Food Safety Administration’’
to—
(A) regulate food safety and related label-
ing to strengthen the protection of the pub-
lic health;
(B) ensure that food facilities fulfill their
responsibility to produce food in a manner
that protects the public health of all people
in the United States;
(C) lead an integrated, systemwide ap-
proach to food safety and to make more ef-
fective and efficient use of resources to pre-
vent foodborne illness;
(D) provide a single focal point for food
safety leadership, both nationally and inter-
nationally; and
(E) provide an integrated food safety re-
search capability, utilizing internally gen-
erated, scientifically and statistically valid
studies or other food safety initiatives, in co-
operation with academic institutions, food
safety nonprofit organizations, and other sci-
entific entities of the Federal and State gov-
ernments, to achieve the continuous im-
provement of research on foodborne illness
and contaminants;
(2) to transfer to the Food Safety Adminis-
tration the food safety, labeling, inspection,
and enforcement functions that, as of the
day before the date of enactment of this Act,
are performed by other Federal agencies; and
(3) to modernize and strengthen the Fed-
eral food safety laws to achieve more effec-
tive application and efficient management of
the laws for the protection and improvement
of public health.

By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and
Mr. MERKLEY):
S. 1997. A bill to authorize transi-
tional sheltering assistance for individ-
uals who live in areas with unhealthy
air quality caused by wildfires, and for
other purposes; to the Committee on
Homeland Security and Governmental
Affairs.
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I
am introducing the Wildfire Smoke Re-
lief Act of 2019 with the ultimate goal
of providing Federal emergency assist-
ance to at risk individuals in areas
with unhealthy air quality caused by
wildfire smoke. By actively preparing
for the effects of wildfire smoke inhala-
tion, this bill attempts to ensure the
long term health and security of all of
those affected by wildfires.
In 2018, over 2,000 fires burned nearly
900,000 acres in the State of Oregon.
The result of these fires was weeks and
weeks of wildfire smoke. In Southern
Oregon alone, there were 39 days with
unhealthy air quality directly caused
by smoke from wildfires. People need
proper air filtration equipment, and in
extreme cases, to seek refuge in a
smokeless area. Communities are being
choked by wildfire smoke, and each
year wildfires are becoming more de-
structive than the previous.
Vulnerable populations like children,
the elderly, pregnant women, and low-
income families are disproportionately
affected by wildfire smoke. Addition-
ally, those with chronic heart or lung
conditions are at a similarly height-
ened risk. Symptoms from smoke inha-
lation can develop within a relatively
short time of exposure, and according
to research, is akin to smoking several
packs of cigarettes per day. Symptoms
vary and can include poor development
of lungs in children, shortness of
breath, coughing, chest pain, nausea,
reduced lung capacity, bronchitis,
headaches, and visual impairment.
The bill would authorize the Federal
Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) to provide assistance to at risk
individuals by providing smoke inhala-
tion prevention equipment and low-
cost home improvements when air
quality causes unhealthy air quality
levels or three consecutive days.
Smoke inhalation prevention equip-
ment would include an air filter, a face
mask or respirator, a portable air fil-
tration unit, and other low cost equip-
ment used to keep smoke out of a
house.
In severe cases, the Wildfire Smoke
Relief Act would authorize FEMA to
provide transitional sheltering assist-
ance for at risk individuals. In these
extreme cases FEMA can arrange alter-
nate, cost-efficient housing arranged
for at-risk people to escape the smoke.
Mr. President, I am pleased to be
joined by Senator JEFF MERKLEY in in-
troducing the bill today and look for-
ward to working with my colleagues
toward enactment of the Wildfire
Smoke Relief Act in the 116th Con-
gress.

(3) does not speak English or Spanish as
his or her preferred language;
(4) has known special needs, behavioral
health issues, or medical issues that would
be better served at an alternative facility;
(5) is a pregnant or parenting teen; or

plicable.

maintaining custody of, or otherwise hous-
ing, unaccompanied alien children (as de-
fined in section 462(g)(2) of the Homeland Se-
curity Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 279(g)(2))), pro-
vided that such Senator or Member has co-
ordinated the oversight visit with the Office
of Refugee Resettlement not less than two
business days in advance to ensure that such

erations) of such facility.

date of enactment of this Act, and monthly
thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to the
Committees on Appropriations of the House

spect to children who were separated from

partment of Homeland Security (DHS) (re-
gardless of whether or not such separation
was pursuant to an option selected by the
children, parents, or guardians), subse-
quently classified as unaccompanied alien
children, and transferred to the care and cus-
tody of ORR during the previous month.
Each report shall contain the following in-
formation:
(1) the number and ages of children so sep-
arated subsequent to apprehension at or be-
tween ports of entry, to be reported by sector

(2) the documented cause of separation, as
reported by DHS when each child was re-
ferred.

HONORING THE LIFE OF HON.
TILMAN ‘‘TILLIE’’ BISHOP
HON. JOE NEGUSE
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, today I wish
to honor the great Colorado statesman and
devoted community member, University of
Colorado Regent Emeritus Tilman ‘‘Tillie’’
Bishop, who passed away at the age of 86 on
Sunday, June 16th.
Born and raised in Colorado, Tillie dedicated
his long and influential life to service for the
people of our state. In 1970, he was elected
to the Colorado General Assembly and served
for four years in the Colorado House of Rep-
resentatives and an additional 24 years in the
Colorado Senate, during the last six years of
which he was president pro tem. Tillie’s 28
years of service in the General Assembly
place him fourth in Colorado history for years
of continuous service, and he is the longest-
serving state senator from the Western Slope.
His tenure of public service also includes four
years as a Mesa County Commissioner. Fi-
nally, Tillie represented our state’s 3rd Con-
gressional District on the University Board of
Regents from 2007 to 2013.
Nationally, Tillie served as Colorado’s rep-
resentative on the Executive Committee of the
National Conference of State Legislatures. He
also sat on the Executive Committee of the
Energy Council.
Tillie’s passion for education and commit-
ment to promoting a school system that dili-
gently serves each and every student that
passes through it was tangible, and no doubt
came from the seven years he taught in public
schools and the 31 years he served as a
Mesa State College administrator.
It was my honor to serve on the Board of
Regents alongside Regent Bishop. Together,
we consistently found ways to work across the
aisle in order to ensure that the students at
the University of Colorado were given a top-
tier education which would prepare them for a
successful future. I’ll never forget Tillie’s deter-
mination and devotion to the University and
the people of Colorado.
I send my deepest condolences to Regent
Bishop’s wife Pat, and to all of his family.

RECOGNIZING JAN ISRAEL
CHARMAN ON HIS 95TH BIRTHDAY
HON. BRADLEY SCOTT SCHNEIDER
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Mr. Jan Israel Charman, a
constituent of Illinois’s Tenth District, who
celebrated his 95th birthday on March 10th.
Mr. Charman was born in Wodzislaw, Po-
land. In 1947, he wedded his wife Estelle, the
beginning of a loving marriage that would
span more than half a century. Shortly after
their marriage, the family immigrated to New
York with their new daughter in 1949. He con-
tinued to move around the country, learning
English and repairing clothes to make a living.
Mr. Charman eventually settled in the Chi-
cago suburbs. He found a deep interest in
business and worked many years at Manny
Berger Shoes where he became a General
Manager and Buyer. Eventually, the
Charmans and their three children, moved to
Buffalo Grove. In Buffalo Grove, Mr. Charman
has become a leader at his synagogue, Con-
gregation Beth Judea, where his zest for life,
love of family and friends, and dedication to
his Jewish faith is an inspiration for all that
surround him.
Mr. Charman still enjoys pursuing his many
interests including travelling and spending time
with his eleven grandchildren and seven great-
grandchildren.
As he celebrates his 95th birthday, it is my
great honor and privilege to recognize the in-
spiring life of Jan Israel Charman and cele-
brate his continued contributions to the Tenth
District community.

RECOGNIZING THE INDIAN
BUSINESS ASSOCIATION
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker,
today I rise to recognize the Indian Business
Association (IBA) for its achievements rep-
resenting Indian-American businesses and its
assistance to numerous Indian-Americans
across the country.
The IBA was conceived in Edison, New Jer-
sey by a group of concerned citizens who felt
the need to act when they witnessed injustices
within their community. This experience was a
catalyst for the IBA’s founding principles of
fairness, solidarity, and social activism. The
IBA has played an important role nationwide
to encourage the Indian-American community
to embrace entrepreneurship.
As their members use their voice to build a
better America, the IBA has worked to be-
come a leader in reinforcing civic participation
in Indian-American community. Members of
the IBA have worked tirelessly to generate
greater voter engagement by organizing non-
partisan voter registration drives. These efforts
by members of the IBA have garnered signifi-
cant attention and helped make the IBA a pil-
lar of the community.
As the IBA has expanded its footprint, the
organization continues to uphold and share In-
dian culture and tradition with Americans of all
walks of life. In its 39th year of existence, the
IBA will host and celebrate its annual New
Jersey India Day Parade, our nation’s largest
such parade honoring India’s independence
and the creation of the world’s largest democ-
racy. Attended by nearly 40,000 people and
includes more than 100 organizations, giving
the parade and opportunity to celebrate the
rich and cultural heritage of Indian-Americans
and their contributions to our country.
Madam Speaker, I want to recognize the
great achievements of the IBA and acknowl-
edge its continuing actions to support Indian-
American entrepreneurs and the jobs they cre-
ate, its dedication to civic engagement, and its
steadfast efforts to advance civil rights protec-
tions for all Americans.

and lifelong Native American activist, Frank
LaMere. I want to join his family, the Nebraska
community, and the national tribal community
in celebrating him and his decades-long dedi-
cation to civil rights for all, particularly for Na-
tive Americans.
An activist from the Winnebago Tribe of Ne-
braska, Mr. LaMere was a prominent grass-
roots leader always ready for action. He was
the longest serving Native American member
of the Democratic National Committee, serving
from 1996 to 2006. He founded both the Ne-
braska Native American Caucus and the Na-
tive American Caucus of the Democratic Na-
tional Committee. In Nebraska, he also served
as the state’s Democratic Party First Associate
Chair. I am proud to have served alongside
him in the Democratic National Committee,
and I will always have fond memories of his
leadership, his stories, perspective and empa-
thetic spirit.
Frank served as a tireless advocate for Na-
tive American rights, leaving behind a legacy
of tremendous and significant change for the
state of Nebraska. He had the gift of truly con-
necting with any individual and used his voice
to lift and empower others. Mr. LaMere fought
against the loss of Native children to the child
welfare system and against the violence they
faced in their foster homes. He was instru-
mental in ending border town beer sales in
Whiteclay, Nebraska, eliminating decades of
predatory sales that fueled alcohol-related
issues on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.
Mr. LaMere advocated to ensure that Native
Americans were always involved in the polit-
ical process and were guaranteed a seat at
every table. He will be greatly missed.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND CA-
REER OF THE HONORABLE
JAMES TORMEY III
HON. JOHN KATKO
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise to cele-
brate the life and career of the Honorable
James Tormey III, a beloved father and hus-
band, distinguished judge, and honorable pub-
lic servant, who passed away on June 22,
2019.
A 1972 graduate of SUNY Cortland, and
1976 graduate of Syracuse University College
of Law, Judge Tormey committed much of his
life to public service. Serving on the Onon-
daga County Legislature for ten years, and
later, as a Syracuse City Court Judge, Su-
preme Court Justice and District Administra-
tive Judge for the 5th Judicial District of New
York, Jim Tormey earned the respect, praise
and trust of many in our community.
Over the course of his esteemed judicial ca-
reer, Judge Tormey took a measured ap-
proach in upholding the law and applying it
fairly. He firmly believed in the justice system
and worked to ensure everyone had access to
it.
As District Administrative Judge, Judge
Tormey supervised the operations and sched-
ules of more than 300 judges serving in the
Fifth Judicial District — many of whom, since
his passing this week, have shared stories of
his strong leadership, his commitment to en-
suring justice, and his respect for all. They
have spoken of his commitment to continued
legal education and pro bono work, and, im-
portantly, of his friendship, mentorship and
distinguished leadership.
Judge Tormey was committed to making
Central New York a better place, and the im-
pact of his work went far beyond the court-
room. He used his role to address some of the
most pressing issues plaguing our commu-
nity—overseeing the establishment of local
Drug Courts, Opioid Courts, Human Trafficking
Court, Youthful Offender Court, and Commu-
nity Court for lower level offenders. His dedi-
cation to Central New York was visible in all
of his actions and he will be truly missed.
Above all, Judge Tormey was a family man,
and deeply loved his wife, Sue, their children
Andrew and Colleen, and his grandchildren. I
ask my colleagues to keep them in mind, as
we honor and remember the life of this de-
voted civil servant.

OATH CEREMONY ON JULY 4, 2019
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with
great pleasure and sincerity that I take this
time to congratulate the fifty-one individuals
who will take their oaths of citizenship on July
4, 2019. In true patriotic fashion, on the day of
our great Nation’s celebration of independ-
ence, a naturalization ceremony will take
place, welcoming new citizens of the United
States of America. This memorable occasion,
coordinated by the League of Women Voters
of the Calumet Area and presided over by
Magistrate Judge Andrew Rodovich, will be
held at The Pavilion at Wolf Lake in Ham-
mond, Indiana.
America is a country founded by immi-
grants. From its beginning, settlers have come
from countries around the world to the United
States in search of better lives for their fami-
lies. The oath ceremony is a shining example
of what is so great about the United States of
America—that people from all over the world
can come together and unite as members of
a free, democratic nation. These individuals
realize that nowhere else in the world offers a
better opportunity for success than here in
America.
On July 4, 2019, the following people, rep-
resenting many nations throughout the world,
will take their oaths of citizenship in Ham-
mond, Indiana: Mounir Oumansour, Taimoor
Syed, Johnson Y. Gah, Joseph Han, Alex
Nguyen, Mubarak Bakhit Haroun, Naga
Sudhakar Chodavarapu, Daniel Jaewon Kim,
Elena Ugwoke, Brendan Chidobe Ugwoke,
Rani Saxena, Sumesh Saxena, Zaira Nashley
Velazquez, Giuseppe Mazzone, Nargis
Natasha Yasir, Erika Anabel Saldivar, Rajesh
Kumar Sharma, Maya Hamwi, Ibrahim Miss
Lissane, Farouk Al Kurdi, Amparo Isabel
Alban Montalvo, Ma Teresa Leon, Sikholisile

Nunez Benitez, David Guillermo Barba, Ai
Ong, Jagoda Petroska, Maria Julia Garcilazo,
Gustavo Adolfo Osorio, Sergey Borisovich
Leonov, Gisela Johanna Kreczmer, Marc
Tuyizere, Muhammad Yasir Hanif Khan, and
Francisco Javier Contreras Torres.
Although each individual has sought to be-
come a citizen of the United States for his or
her own reasons, be it for education, occupa-
tion, or to offer their loved ones better lives,
each is inspired by the fact that the United
States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln de-
scribed it, a country ‘‘. . . of the people, by the
people, and for the people.’’ They realize that
the United States is truly a free nation. By
seeking American citizenship, they have made
the decision that they want to live in a place
where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment
of the Constitution, they can practice religion
as they choose, speak their minds without fear
of punishment, and assemble in peaceful pro-
test should they choose to do so.
Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask that you
and my other distinguished colleagues join me
in congratulating these fifty-one individuals
who will become citizens of the United States
of America on July 4, 2019, the anniversary of
our Nation’s independence. They, too, will be
American citizens, guaranteed the inalienable
rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness. We, as a free and democratic nation,
congratulate them and welcome them.
HONORING RACINE POLICE
OFFICER JOHN HETLAND
HON. BRYAN STEIL
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, today, our
Racine community honors the life and service
of Racine Police Officer John Hetland.
On June 17, Officer Hetland was killed while
trying to stop an armed robbery in Racine.
Even when off-duty, Officer Hetland did not
waver to act.
Officer Hetland served the Racine commu-
nity for 24 years as a police officer. Born in
Racine, he attended the University of Wis-
consin-Milwaukee to study criminal justice.
Those who knew Officer Hetland described
him as a compassionate, brave man. A great
baseball player. A loving father of two and de-
voted husband. A protector of our community.
But to our Racine community, Officer
Hetland will always be regarded as a hero.
This tragedy is a solemn reminder of the
sacrifices members of law enforcement make
every day to protect us.
My prayers are with the Hetland family,
friends, and the entire law enforcement com-
munity grieving this loss.
We will never forget Officer Hetland.

RENDITION & TORTURE: AN
ACCOUNTING
HON. DAVID E. PRICE
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I rise to include in the Record the
executive summary of the North Carolina
Commission of Inquiry on Torture’s (NCCIT)
seminal report, Torture Flights: North Caro-
lina’s Role in the CIA’s Rendition and Torture
Program. I do so today in recognition of the
United Nation’s ‘‘International Day in Support
of Victims of Torture,’’ and to emphasize the
continuing role of Congress as well as in-
formed and engaged citizens in bringing to
light the Central Intelligence Agency’s (CIA)
Rendition, Detention, and Interrogation (RDI)
program.
I am reminded of this important duty by an
exceptional group of North Carolinians who
established NCCIT—a non-governmental and
non-partisan commission—to investigate North
Carolina’s participation in the CIA’s RDI pro-
gram following the September 11 attacks,
which is described in its September 2018 re-
port.
The report found that in the first stage of the
RDI program, a private company based in
North Carolina used publicly-funded infrastruc-
ture to conduct over 80 percent of identified
CIA rendition flights from September 2001 to
March 2004. North Carolina public infrastruc-
ture was therefore involved in the detention
and rendition of at least 49 individuals, without
regard for the rule of law or due process. Ac-
cording to the report, some of these individ-
uals turned out not to be involved in terrorism
and have yet to receive official acknowledge-
ment or redress, and some of these individ-
uals continue to suffer from their mistreatment.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E843
June 26, 2019
This report complements the Senate Intel-
ligence Committee’s 2014 report on the RDI
program, which found that the CIA’s ‘‘en-
hanced interrogation techniques’’ were not ef-
fective, that the program was poorly managed,
and that the CIA misled Congress and the
public. I commend Senator Dianne Feinstein
and the other Committee members and staff
who worked on this report, and I applaud
NCCIT for their steadfast commitment to
bringing transparency and accountability to the
State of North Carolina’s involvement in these
activities.
Even in our darkest moments, we must al-
ways uphold core American values, including
respect for the rule of law and human rights.
I encourage my colleagues to read NCCIT’s
report, including its recommendations for local,
state, and federal officials, so that we may
learn from the mistakes of the past and chart
a more promising course for the future.
TORTURE FLIGHTS: NORTH CAROLINA’S ROLE IN
THE CIA RENDITION AND TORTURE PRO-
GRAM—EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
North Carolina Commission of Inquiry on
Torture
In the wake of the attacks of September 11,
2001, the U.S. government ushered in a large-
scale program of secret detention and tor-
ture that relied significantly on the State of
North Carolina. Six days after the attacks,
President George W. Bush signed a covert
memorandum that authorized the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) to seize, detain,
and interrogate suspected terrorists around
the world. This report investigates North
Carolina’s role in that illegal program.
The program made use of Department of
Defense facilities, a network of ten CIA-con-
trolled secret prisons or black sites in six
countries, and the facilities of foreign gov-
ernments. In what was called the Rendition,
Detention, and Interrogation (RDI) program,
the CIA abducted and imprisoned at least 119
individuals before the practice was officially
ended and repudiated by Executive Order in
2009. Given that detainees were also handed
over to foreign governments, and the secrecy
surrounding the program, the number of af-
fected individuals is likely far higher.
Within weeks of the RDI program’s author-
ization, Aero Contractors, Ltd. (Aero), based
in Smithfield, NC, began operating the first
of two aircraft for extraordinary, or violent
and secret, renditions. Between September
2001 and March 2004, Aero-operated aircraft—
a Gulfstream V turbojet and Boeing 737 busi-
ness jet—were used in more than 80% of iden-
tified RDI renditions. Over the full length of
the program, Aero transported 34 of the
known 119 CIA prisoners, plus at least 15 of
those sent by the CIA to foreign custody, on
69 identified rendition circuits. These flights,
using North Carolina’s public infrastructure
and flown by its citizens, implicate North
Carolina directly in abduction, forced dis-
appearance, and torture.
Since 2005, North Carolina anti-torture ac-
tivists from across the political spectrum
have protested these actions. Motivated by
diverse ethical and religious beliefs as well
as a firm commitment to the rule of law, ac-
tivists from North Carolina Stop Torture
Now have joined with the North Carolina
Council of Churches and many other allies.
Citizens have pressured public officials at all
levels of government to investigate the
state’s complicity in the CIA’s illegal and
immoral program.
Citizen-led activism culminated in 2015 in
the creation of the North Carolina Commis-
sion of Inquiry on Torture (NCCIT), a non-
governmental organization dedicated to
transparency and accountability regarding
the state’s participation in U.S. torture. The
NCCIT launched officially in 2017 with a
blue-ribbon panel of Commissioners who
have expertise in domestic and international
law, military operations, human rights,
interfaith religious dialogue, psychology,
and public health.
The Commission initiated a large-scale in-
vestigation into North Carolina’s involve-
ment in torture and rendition. Torture
Flights: North Carolina’s role in the CIA ren-
dition and torture program details the re-
sults of that investigation and makes rec-
ommendations for future action. The report
draws on original research and expert testi-
mony provided at public hearings as well as
the extensive data compiled by The Ren-
dition Project, the Bureau of Investigative
Journalism, and the Human Rights Policy
Lab of the University of North Carolina
School of Law, among other sources.
Torture Flights provides the most com-
prehensive research to date on North Caro-
lina’s complicity in the rendition phase of
the RDI program. The Senate Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence ‘‘Torture Report,’’ a
redacted Executive Summary of which was
released in 2014 while the full report remains
classified, focused on the detention and in-
terrogation of detainees who were held in
CIA custody. Torture Flights demonstrates
that that program depended upon both North
Carolina’s private citizens and public infra-
structure.
Further, Torture Flights builds on the
Senate’s work by addressing renditions
themselves as an integral component of a
system to break individuals down through
violent interrogations. As the report details,
Aero transported at least 49 individuals, who
were forcibly seized without any due process,
in a manner that itself amounted to torture
and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.
Preparation for ‘‘rendition’’ involved phys-
ical and sometimes sexual assault, drugging,
and sensory deprivation. Rendition flights
were experiences of prolonged pain, dread,
and terror. The whereabouts of the individ-
uals flown by Aero, who were citizens of 16
countries and included a 16-year-old student
and a pregnant woman, were not disclosed,
not even to their families. They were ‘‘dis-
appeared’’ for months if not years, causing
agony to them and their loved ones. Even
today, the fates of eight of those rendered by
Aero remain unknown.
Many of the prisoners were taken to CIA
‘‘black sites,’’ where they experienced beat-
ings, prolonged stress positions, temperature
extremes, long-term isolation, various water
tortures, mock execution, and sexual abuse.
In violation of international law, the CIA
transported some prisoners to foreign cus-
tody where they were subject to torture and
abuse. Kidnapping, torture, and secret deten-
tion occurred without respect for victims’ in-
nocence or guilt and absent any legal process
for them to contest their abductions.
Survivors of the RDI program and their
families continue to suffer from these experi-
ences. Torture and prolonged detention have
left lasting physical, emotional, and social
injuries. This in turn harms relationships
and livelihoods, which then amplifies the
psychological damage. To resume meaning-
ful and secure lives, survivors need medical,
psychological and social support, guaranteed
legal status, and economic opportunity.
This report also carefully considers the
moral and legal responsibility of North Caro-
lina for its involvement in CIA-sponsored ac-
tivities. The federal government has inter-
national law obligations under both the Con-
vention Against Torture and the Inter-
national Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights not only to prevent torture, but also
to provide accountability and redress for tor-
ture. It did none of these and therefore has
failed to meet its international obligations.
Given that the federal government has abdi-
cated responsibility, North Carolina can and
should fill the gap. Its role as home to Aero
obligates it to do so. State and federal laws
against conspiracy and corruption are among
those instruments that apply to Aero’s ac-
tivities.
As this report documents, Aero’s central
role in the CIA rendition and torture pro-
gram is beyond dispute. But instead of hold-
ing Aero accountable, the State of North
Carolina and Johnston County until now
have effectively endorsed its activities. This
support has taken the form of hosting the
company’s headquarters at the Johnston
County Airport and providing it with various
airport and other county services. Since
Aero’s participation in criminal abduction
and assault was publicly revealed, the State
of North Carolina has made several grants to
the county airport, at least one of which was
specifically used to fortify the perimeter of
only Aero’s corner of the facility.
Torture Flights concludes with specific
recommendations directed at federal and
state officials as well as toward North Caro-
lina citizens, whose engagement has kept the
spotlight on Aero’s activities and whose con-
tinued attention is needed to ensure ac-
countability. The recommendations seek to
increase transparency about the program
and accountability for the illegal actions;
provide acknowledgment, redress and repara-
tions to its victims; and prevent the future
use of torture. As the report notes, addi-
tional research is also needed on the involve-
ment of other North Carolina private cor-
porations and public airports in extraor-
dinary renditions in order to complete the
record of the RDI program. At the broadest
level, the goal is to ensure that neither the
federal government nor the state of North
Carolina engage in or support torture again.

HONORING GERALD FISCHMAN OF
THE CAPITAL GAZETTE
HON. JOHN P. SARBANES
OF MARYLAND
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I include

(By Frederick Rasmussen)
If veteran Capital Gazette editorial writer
Gerald Fischman could have chosen what he
would be doing on the last day of his life,
this was it:
He was a newspaperman.
Mr. Fischman, longtime editorial page edi-
tor for The Capital, was killed June 28 in the
attack on the newspaper’s Annapolis office.
He was 61.
‘‘You know the cliche, still waters run
deep? That was Gerald,’’ said Rick Hutzell,
editor of the Capital Gazette newspapers.
‘‘He was thoughtful, witty, dedicated to his
craft—all the things you hear other people
say. But he also had a strong sense of what
was moral and what was right.’’
‘‘He was a wonderful person and really
quiet, but if you took the time to get to
know him you discovered how brilliant he
was and his extraordinary dry wit,’’ said Teri
Winslow, a former Capital Gazette writer,

editor and State House correspondent who
sat next to him for 20 years.
‘‘He was a walking encyclopedia of Mary-
land history and just plain facts. His desk
was overrun with books,’’ said Ms. Winslow,
a Hanover resident who is now digital news
manager for the state Department of Trans-
portation.
‘‘At night, Gerald wrote his editorials and
when he was finished, would help me proof
the paper. . . . He never missed anything,
and if we found something funny we’d crack
up and double over laughing,’’ she said.
‘‘When he finished an editorial he’d read it
out loud to check its cadence, and had a
clicker he used to count the words,’’ she re-
called. ‘‘He was incredibly thorough.’’
Gerald Fischman was born in Washington,
the son of Morton and Charlotte Fischman.
He was a year old when the family moved to
Silver Spring.
After graduating from high school, Mr.
Fischman attended the University of Mary-
land, College Park, and received a bachelor’s
degree in journalism in 1979. During his col-
lege days he was an editor for The Diamond-
back, the university’s student newspaper.
He began his career in 1980 as a reporter at
The Carroll County Times and later was pro-
moted to copy editor. Edward J. ‘‘Mac’’
McDonough, public information officer for
the Maryland Emergency Management Agen-
cy, was sports editor of The Times during
Mr. Fischman’s tenure there.
‘‘Fisch, we always called him that, was
very meticulous, quiet and gifted, with a wry
sense of humor,’’ said Mr. McDonough, a
Towson resident who was later an editor on
The Baltimore Sun’s old Carroll County edi-
tion.
‘‘As the chaos of deadline approached, he’d
come up with some wry observation, and
then he’d go back to work. This happened
fairly frequently,’’ he said. ‘‘He was a great
copy editor; the paper would never have got-
ten out on time without him.’’
He recalled Mr. Fischman as being ‘‘not
gregarious . . . but very engaging when talk-
ing to you. [He] was not the kind of guy
who’d go out for a drink with the staff after
the paper was put to bed.’’
In 1990 he joined the staff of The Mont-
gomery Journal in Rockville. He did a two-
year stint as a copy editor, then was pro-
moted to assistant city editor.
Ron Jones was a friend of Mr. Fischman’s
for more than 30 years. They had worked to-
gether at The Carroll County Times and
later The Montgomery Journal.
‘‘As an editor, Gerald was incredibly thor-
ough and always had tons of questions for re-
porters unless their pieces were incredibly
well-written, which was not often,’’ said Mr.
Jones, a Gaithersburg resident who is a night
copy editor for The Washington Post. ‘‘He
rarely got upset or raised his voice and was
always calm, collected and very detailed-ori-
ented.
‘‘He wanted stories to be as objective and
accurate as possible,’’ he said. ‘‘He wanted to
know their core themes and that everything
made sense, and it was the same with his edi-
torials.’’
Mr. Fischman went to work for The Cap-
ital in 1992, and quickly developed a reputa-
tion for his trenchant, hard-hitting and fact-
laden editorials that reflected the news-
paper’s community temperament and roots.
Mr. McDonough said his colleague ‘‘found his
niche’’ at The Capital.
‘‘When he had an idea for an editorial, he’d
parse every word and check every fact,’’ he
said. ‘‘That he was a survivor for more than
30 years in the business is a testament to
who he was.’’
Mr. Fischman was fascinated by the bi-
zarre absurdities of government and wrote
often about them. He also wrote about mass
shootings, gun violence and gun ownership.
‘‘He loved the odd things from history, and
was skeptical of any New Age stuff and reli-
gion,’’ Mr. Jones said.
Mr. Fischman’s work earned him numerous
awards from the Maryland-Delaware-D.C.
Press Association—including two recent hon-
ors for editorials related to the case involv-
ing a noose found at a Crofton school, and a
piece about censorship at County Council
meetings. He also received awards from the
Chesapeake Associated Press, as well as
Mark Twain Awards for Outstanding Edi-
torial, Best Editorial and Best of Show Edi-
torial.
Mr. Fischman brought an unflappable na-
ture and strong work ethic to the newsroom.
Long hours and days were not uncommon,
and he steered clear of debates over long
hours, low pay and where newspapers will be
in 10 years—or in 10 minutes.
‘‘When deadlines approached and things
were going on, Gerald never panicked,’’ re-
called Mr. Jones. ‘‘He was the kind of person
who always kept his cool. He was level-head-
ed.’’
‘‘He was a human search engine and did he
know Maryland politics,’’ Ms. Winslow said.
‘‘He was so loved by his colleagues.’’
‘‘I’ve have the difficult task of trying to
write in Gerald’s place,’’ Mr. Hutzell said.
‘‘I’ve written four editorials so far, and be-
fore I start every one I ask myself: What
would Gerald say? I wish I had half the in-
sight into our community and human nature
that he brought to the job every day.’’
Mr. Fischman had lived most of his life as
a confirmed newspaper bachelor, and sur-
prised his colleagues when he announced
some years ago that he had fallen in love and
was marrying the former Saran Erdenebat, a
noted opera singer from Mongolia.
He had met the lyric soprano at the John
F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts
while attending a performance of Richard
Wagner’s ‘‘Die Walkure.’’ They were married
shortly thereafter.
The Pasadena resident who enjoyed col-
lecting books and reading was also a clas-
sical music, opera and ballet fan.
Services scheduled for Sunday are private.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by a
stepdaughter, Uka Saran of Miami, Fla.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE REDEDI-
CATION OF THE SLOCUM STREET
PARK IN HONOR OF ANDREW
BARILLA, JR.
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Andrew Barilla, Jr. and
Swoyersville Borough, Pennsylvania as
Swoyersville rededicates its Slocum Street
Park as the Andrew Barilla, Jr. Park.
Andrew Barilla, Jr. has been a force for
positive change in Swoyersville Borough and
an outstanding member of his community in
every way. He was born in Swoyersville and
was the borough’s first All-Scholastic athlete in
three sports. Driven to athletic and academic
excellence, he attended Michigan State Uni-
versity on a football scholarship. After a se-
vere knee injury ended his athletic career, An-
drew finished his degree at Lock Haven State
Teachers College.
As a ten-year member of Swoyersville Bor-
ough Council, Andrew made it his mission to
share his love of sports and remain active with
the children in his community. He founded
Slocum Street Park, which will now bear his
name. He is also a charter member of the
Swoyersville Baseball Club for Boys and was
a driving force behind building Roosevelt Sta-
dium. Andrew also generously sponsors
Barilla’s team in the Wyoming Valley Girls’
Travel Softball League. For his athletic prow-
ess and commitment to sports, he was in-
ducted into the Luzerne County Sports Hall of
Fame in 1991.
Andrew’s dedication to his community does
not end with athletics. He is a past president
of the Crime Clinic of Greater Wyoming Valley
and the Special Court Judges Association,
and he recently retired as the Magisterial Dis-
trict Judge for Swoyersville, Forty Fort,
Luzerne, Courtdale, and Pringle.
It is a privilege to recognize Andrew during
the rededication of the Slocum Street Park in
his honor. I thank him for his lifetime of serv-
ice to the people of Swoyersville Borough and
beyond. May the park continue to be a place
for residents and visitors to gather and enjoy
for generations to come.

Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, I am de-

now, in our fast-paced world, opera invites us
to slow down. It is bold and extravagant, and
it evokes emotion unlike other art forms. Both
passionate and beautiful, opera is an antidote
to our busy lives, showcasing voices both
powerful and exquisite, honed by years of
training.
I am grateful to Opera Maine for bringing
acclaimed, nationally and internationally
known vocal artists to the state. They have
developed a reputation for creativity, sophis-
tication, and artistic excellence, and they have
played a key role in educating the next gen-
eration of aspiring theater performers.
As Maine’s creative culture continues to
grow and receive well-deserved recognition, I
want to thank Opera Maine for 25 years of en-
hancing the quality of life in our beloved state.
I commend them—the little opera company
that could—for their outstanding leadership
and success, and for many years of entertain-
ment and inspiration.
Bravo.

HONORING ROB HIAASEN OF THE
CAPITAL GAZETTE
HON. JOHN P. SARBANES
OF MARYLAND
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I include
in the RECORD an obituary of Rob Hiaasen, an
editor of the Capital Gazette in Annapolis
Maryland.
[From the Baltimore Sun]
CAPITAL GAZETTE VICTIM ROB HIAASEN RE-
MEMBERED AS A WRITER WITH A DEFT AND
GENTLE TOUCH
(By Jacques Kelly)
Rob Hiaasen, a feature writer and editor
recalled for the deft and understanding touch
he applied to his off-center stories, will be
remembered Monday at a private memorial
service. He was one of the five staff members
killed Thursday at the Annapolis Capital Ga-
zette.
The Timonium man was 59.
‘‘Rob was a terrific reporter because he had
an innate curiosity,’’ said the former Balti-
more Sun columnist Kevin Cowherd, a close
friend. ‘‘He was a master of asking questions
of the people he wrote about. It was one of
his strengths. He was also drawn to quirky
characters. In all his writing he tried to
bring out the humanity.’’
Mr. Hiaasen was born in Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., to Kermit Odel Hiaasen, an attorney,
and Patricia Moran, a homemaker. He grad-
uated from Plantation High School and
earned a bachelor’s degree in communica-
tions at the University of Florida.
He initially worked as an AM radio re-
porter and landed a job in Raleigh, N.C.
There he met a competitor, Maria Mills.
‘‘It was a small town and small radio mar-
ket and everybody knew each other,’’ she
said. ‘‘We got married and moved around and
landed in San Antonio.
‘‘We both hated our jobs there.’’
Mr. Hiaasen reconsidered his radio work
and decided instead to pursue newspaper
writing and reporting. He got a reporting job
at an afternoon paper, the Petersburg, Va.,
Progress Index. But first, he had to pass the
paper’s oral spelling test.
‘‘He remembered to put the P in rasp-
berry,’’ Maria Hiaasen said. ‘‘He was always
a good speller.’’
Within 18 months, he and his wife moved
on to the Palm Beach Post. He worked in its
downtown newsroom; she covered police in
Palm Beach, County.
Tom O’Hara, the retired managing editor
of the Palm Beach Post, recognized the last
name on Mr. Hiaasen’s job application. He
knew Mr. Hiaasen’s brother, the novelist and
longtime Miami Herald columnist Carl
Hiaasen.
‘‘Rob was just charming,’’ Mr. O’Hara said.
‘‘It was a like a no-brainer to hire him. He
was a Florida boy and that was a great at-
traction to me.’’
Mr. O’Hara assigned Mr. Hiaasen to cover
county government, a beat overseen by a me-
ticulous editor. Mr. Hiaasen often began his
stories with colorful anecdotes, while his edi-
tor required numbers.
‘‘For Rob, it was a baptism by fire,’’ Mr.
O’Hara said. ‘‘His editor would lop off the
first three paragraphs. It was clear Rob be-
longed in features.
‘‘He thrived there and was a delight. He
was enthusiastic about his stories. Every-
body loved him. I liked sitting by him and
listening to his little asides.’’
In 1991, Mr. Hiaasen wrote a feature about
five people who contracted AIDS from a
Palm Beach dentist. ‘‘Dr. Acer’s Deadly Se-
cret: How AIDS joined the lives of a dentist
and his patients,’’ won a national journalism
writing award, and Mr. Hiaasen was hired by
The Baltimore Sun as a features writer.
Colleagues recalled his daily routine. He
took long walks, and became enamored of
Baltimore’s neighborhoods and their char-
acters. He ambled through Bolton Hill,
Mount Vernon and Fells Point in search of
offbeat tales to tell.
Friends said Mr. Hiassen steered clear of
newsroom factions and social circles. One de-
scribed him affectionately as ‘‘a tall, brood-
ing Norwegian.’’
‘‘Only two words in that phrase are true,’’
Mr. Cowherd said. ‘‘Rob was never brooding.
He needed to laugh the way he needed oxy-
gen. He was the best colleague you could
ever have. In a roomful of towering egos, he
was the first guy to come up and say, ‘You
did a great job.’ ’’
Mr. Hiaasen wrote about Mel Sherr, a vet-
eran of D-Day familiar to Baltimoreans as a
strolling violin player.
‘‘Mr. Sherr knows what your favorite song
is,’’ Mr. Hiassen wrote. ‘‘While he’s asking
guests where they’re from, he’ll be guessing
their age and era. He’ll then pluck a song
from his play list and play. Guests nod their
heads and smile. Some blush. They now re-
member what they had forgotten. . . . Mr.
Sherr will not be stumped by requests.’’
He also wrote about Kirk Bloodsworth, the
ex-Marine and Eastern Shore waterman who
was the first person to be sentenced to death
and then exonerated by DNA evidence.
Mr. Hiaasen spent a year from 2003 to 2004
as a John Knight Fellow in Journalism at
Stanford University. While there, he acted in
a play and studied singing.
Mr. Hiaasen accepted a newsroom buyout
offer in 2008 and left The Sun. By 2010 he
joined the Annapolis Capital. He mentored
reporters as an editor and wrote a Sunday
column.
‘‘He did an amazing pivot to become an
editor,’’ Mr. Cowherd said. ‘‘He became ev-
erything you want of a good editor—gently
pushing them to do their best work and to
not accept mediocrity.’’
He also taught a news writing class at the
University of Maryland’s Philip Merrill Col-
lege of Journalism.
And he kept telling his stories in his gentle
tone.
‘‘When there’s no hiding from news, it’s
time for a haircut,’’ he advised in a column
late last year. ‘‘Getting a haircut—once a
horrific, spirit-crushing event during the
teenage years—is a safe haven for the news
beleaguered. There, in the wrapped confines
of your barber’s or stylist’s chair, you can
slink away to a news-free zone. There, on
your temporary throne, you are clipped and
pampered by intimate hands.’’ In addition to
his wife of 33 years, an English teacher at
Dulaney High School, he leaves a son, Ben
Hiaasen, a Towson attorney; two daughters,
Samantha Hiaasen, an assistant manager of
the Pratt Street Barnes & Noble store in
Baltimore, and Hannah Hiaasen, a craft asso-
ciate at Apparatus in New York who lives in
Brooklyn, NY; his brother, Carl, in Vero
Beach, Fla.; two sisters, Judy Hiaasen of
Plantation, Fla., and Barb Hiaasen of Davie,
Fla.; and many nieces and nephews.

HONORING ALYCE GRIFFIN
CLARKE
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable
public servant from the Backwoods of
Deovelente (a few miles northeast of Belzoni),
to the Mississippi State Capital—Alyce Griffin
Clarke, 1st African American female elected to
the Mississippi House of Representatives in
1985.
In the backwoods of Deovelente, in the last
house near the Yazoo River, a beautiful baby
girl was born to the late Mr. Henry Griffin and
Mrs. Fannie Alice Merriweather Griffin. They
named this beautiful precious baby girl, Alyce
Myrtle Griffin.
This young lady walked the dusty roads of
Deovelente to Deovelente Elementary School,
to Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church, where
she was baptized, to Mt. Arratt Methodist
Church, and to the one store in the commu-
nity. As a matter of fact, she walked every-
where she went. The family did not own a car
as they were sharecroppers. She chopped
and picked cotton as so many of us did. She
still boasts about being able to pick 300
pounds before quitting time and teasing others
still in the field.
As the years passed, Ms. Griffin graduated
from McNair High School, Belzoni, Mississippi
in 1957. She went on to graduate from Alcorn
College and other universities. She later be-
came Mrs. Alyce Griffin Clarke when she mar-
ried the late Mr. L.W. Clarke. They became
the proud parents of one son, Demarquis
Clarke.
In 1985, Mrs. Alyce Griffin Clarke became
the first African American female elected to
the Mississippi Legislature.
Currently, Representative Alyce Griffin
Clarke is still active in the same post where
she first made history, and we are all very
proud of her accomplishments.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in recognizing Representative Alyce Griffin
Clarke.

HON. JOHN R. CARTER
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I
proudly salute Colonel David R. Gibson as he
retires after 33 years of honorable service.
Throughout his extraordinary military career,
COL Gibson embodied the duty, honor, and
loyalty that makes the U.S. Army the world’s
premier fighting force.
COL Gibson’s commitment to investing his
gifts, talents, and abilities in service of his na-
tion is a deeply held creed that speaks to the
generosity and activism of a true and devoted
patriot. Throughout his career, he earned nu-
merous academic and military accolades that
garnered the respect and admiration of his
peers. His resume tells the story of a man
unafraid to embrace the challenges that forge
the leaders our nation needs.
Retirement is meant to be celebrated and
enjoyed. It is not the end of a career, but the
beginning of a new adventure. I thank Colonel
David R. Gibson for his service and dedication
to our great nation. I proudly join his family,
friends, and colleagues in wishing him nothing
but the best for his richly-deserved retirement.

FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GEN-
ERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIA-
TIONS ACT, 2020
SPEECH OF
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 25, 2019
The House in Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union had under
consideration the bill (H.R. 3351) making ap-
propriations for financial services and gen-
eral government for the fiscal year ending
September 30, 2020, and for other purposes:
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I can tell
my colleagues with great confidence that
USDA’s proposal to move the Economic Re-
search Service (ERS) and the National Insti-
tute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) outside
the National Capital Region is a bad idea.
We held a hearing on the issue last March,
at which four former senior USDA officials with
70 years of combined experience at the two
agencies, from both parties, expressed their
deep opposition to this proposal.
Numerous stakeholders have expressed
strong opposition, including the National Farm-
ers Union, the Association of American Veteri-
nary Colleges and nearly 1700 other organiza-
tions, university officials, and individuals from
47 states.
We have not received a single letter in sup-
port of this proposal.
USDA violated the Appropriations Commit-
tee’s statutorily required 30-day waiting period
for such proposals when it took action to im-
plement the proposal six days after notifying
the Committee.
It failed utterly to comply with the require-
ments of the conferees in the 2019 omnibus
appropriations report to submit all cost bene-
fits for the move and a detailed analysis of
any research benefits of a relocation when it
submitted the 2020 budget.
USDA has also refused numerous requests
from Members of the House and Senate that
it provide the original cost-benefit analysis de-
veloped before the proposal was announced.
It finally gave us a so-called ‘‘cost-benefit
analysis’’ after the final site was selected.
But an independent analysis of this sup-
posed analysis found that ‘‘USDA leadership
failed to follow federal guidelines for the ben-
efit cost analysis’’ and that ‘‘the move to Kan-
sas City will cost taxpayers between $83 and
$182 million dollars, rather than saving them
$300 million dollars.’’
Large numbers of ERS and NIFA employ-
ees have left as a result of this proposal.
I fear that ultimately, these agencies will be-
come mere shadows of their former selves,
with the loss of hundreds of years of exper-
tise.
These agencies’ mission is to achieve the
best science through research that advances
U.S. agriculture and our understanding of the
agricultural economy.
I believe that the Department’s proposal
puts that mission at great risk.
I urge a yes vote on the Norton amendment.
HONORING JOHN MCNAMARA OF
THE CAPITAL GAZETTE
HON. JOHN P. SARBANES
OF MARYLAND
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I include
in the RECORD an obituary of John McNamara,
a reporter for the Capital Gazette in Annapolis
Maryland.
[From the Baltimore Sun]
JOHN MCNAMARA, CAPITAL GAZETTE SPORTS
REPORTER, RECALLED FOR HIS VAST KNOWL-
EDGE AND LOVE OF THE TERPS
(By Jacques Kelly)
John McNamara, an editor and sports re-
porter for The Capital Gazette who covered
the University of Maryland Terrapins and
was a high school basketball history spe-
cialist, died June 28 at the attack at the An-
napolis newspaper’s office.
The Silver Spring resident was 56.
‘‘Basketball was a love of his and he had a
great feel for the game,’’ said former Mary-
land men’s basketball coach Gary Williams.
‘‘He could have made a lot more money else-
where, but he had the job he wanted and it
was what he wanted to be. I gave him a lot
of credit for that.’’
Born in Washington and raised in Be-
thesda, he was the son of Thomas McNamara
Sr., a federal Department of Education fi-
nancial analyst, and his wife, Elizabeth
Lynch.
He was a 1979 graduate of St. John’s Col-
lege High School in Washington and obtained
a journalism degree from the University of
Maryland College Park, where he had re-
ported sports for campus newspaper, The
Diamondback.
‘‘John was one of the most honest and fair-
est reporters I have ever met,’’ said Johnny
Holliday, sportscaster and longtime radio
personality. ‘‘I enjoyed being around him.
‘‘He was of the mindset that he was going
to pick out the positive aspects of an indi-
vidual player. He told me he understood the
greatest thrill for a 9- or 10-year-old was see-
ing their name in print.’’
Mr. McNamara played softball and basket-
ball informally in school and had delivered
newspapers for the old Washington Evening
Star. He retained childhood memories of
watching the old Washington Senators play
at RFK Stadium. He was also a Bullets bas-
ketball fan. While at Maryland, he covered
high school sports for The Washington Post.
‘‘He had two job offers right out of col-
lege,’’ said his wife, Andrea Chamblee, whom
he met while both were Maryland students.
‘‘One was for $15,000 a year as an agate-type
clerk doing box scores for USA Today. The
other was writing sports for $13,000 at the
Hagerstown Herald-Mail. He took [the Her-
ald-Mail] because it allowed him to do what
he wanted to do—and in that first year [1983]
he covered the Orioles, who were in the
World Series.
‘‘He felt he made the right choice. His first
year out of the college and he was covering
a World Series. He was exhilarated.’’
She said they married in 1985 because by
then he was making $15,000—they had agreed
to delay their wedding until he had passed
that financial milepost.
‘‘He could talk sports to someone who
knew plenty and he could talk to someone
who knew almost nothing.’’ his wife said.
‘‘And both parties would leave feeling they
understood the game better.’’
‘‘Coaches were always impressed by his in-
sight and knowledge of the game, but John
was a good enough storyteller that he could
give a casual fan great insight,’’ said Doug
Dull, a friend and colleague at the Hagers-
town paper.
‘‘He’d hang out at the local grocery store
when the Street & Smith’s college basketball
yearbook came out and he would pull out a
highlighter as if he were doing homework.
He knew more about Pepperdine and Fresno
State than anyone in Maryland.’’
In 1987 Mr. McNamara joined The Capital
as a copy editor, then worked as sports edi-
tor for the old Prince George’s Journal from
1989 to 1994. He then rejoined the Annapolis
paper.
‘‘John never changed,’’ said David Elfin, a
freelance journalist and friend who lives in
Bethesda. ‘‘He always loved sports and he
was very passionate about the University of
Maryland. I can’t tell you how many games
he had covered at Maryland for all the pa-
pers where he’d worked.’’
He was particularly fond of the univer-
sity’s Cole Field House.
‘‘No matter if I met him at a Nationals
game or at the Capitals or Redskins, Mary-
land was his comfort level,’’ Mr. Elfin said.
‘‘It was almost as if he were walking into
Cheers.’’
In 2001 Mr. McNamara and Mr. Elfin wrote
‘‘Cole Classics: Maryland Basketball’s Great-
est Men and Moments.’’
Eric Prisbell, who previously covered col-
lege sports for The Washington Post and is
now a Dallas sports freelance writer, said:
‘‘John’s basketball knowledge was second to
none. He had a sharp eye and everyone re-
spected him.
‘‘He was an old-school journalist. He val-
ued the relationships he’d established with
coaches. John could be very funny. With just
a look he could make a whole table roar with
laughter.’’
In 2014 his editors at The Capital Gazette
changed his assignment and named him edi-
tor and reporter of the Bowie Blade-News
and Crofton-West County Gazette.
‘‘He took the job change as gracefully as
any sportswriter can,’’ said his wife.
He had been completing research and con-
ducting interviews for a book on the history
and roots of high school basketball in the
District of Columbia and its suburbs. As part
of the project he had visited former NBA and
college players who grew up in the area.
A memorial service for Mr. McNamara will
be held from 10 a.m. to noon Tuesday at the
chapel at the University of Maryland, Col-
lege Park.
In addition to his wife of 33 years, a Food
and Drug Administration attorney, survivors
include two brothers, Charles McNamara of
Bethesda and Danny McNamara of Amster-
dam, N.Y.; and three sisters, Jane McNamara
of Mercer Island, Wash., Mary McNamara of
Washington and Peggy Pyles of Bethesda.

Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to pay tribute to someone who has made a
significant impact here in this proud institution

years, my office and I have been extremely
fortunate to have Patricia ‘‘Tricia’’ Evans on
our staff.

mildly. She’s also an Irish Catholic through

vout meat and potatoes eater—except, of

course, on Fridays during Lent. After grad-
uating from Iona College, Tricia taught first
grade at Good Shepherd School for a few
years before shifting to politics. In the summer
of 1979, Tricia launched her career on Capitol
Hill as a staff assistant for conservative stal-
wart and fellow New Yorker Jack Kemp. Prior
to joining my office, Tricia served a number of
House Members, including dedicated tenures
serving my former California colleague Elton
Gallegly and Arizonan J.D. Hayworth.
In 2007, I was incredibly fortunate to have
a seasoned staff member like Tricia join my
office. When she first came on board, Tricia
wasn’t exactly a big fan of flying, especially
cross county to our district in California. But
after we introduced her to In-N-Out Burger she
became more open to flying out West—it’s
amazing how a Double-Double can ease anxi-
eties. We never quite converted her from a
New Yorker to a Californian, but I’d like to
think she will always carry within her a little
piece of the Golden State.
As Tricia winds up her time in my office to
take on a new opportunity, it’s impossible to
sum up her immense contributions. Of all my
constituents whom she has helped, I think that
the folks from the Monday Morning Group will
miss her the most. I know Tricia rightfully
takes great pride in her efforts to secure pas-
sage of the 9/11 Memorial Act into law. She
was deeply and personally touched by the 9/
11 attack as a native New Yorker and by the
loss of her friend, Navy Captain Bob Dolan,
who was killed at the Pentagon on that tragic
day. Tricia took the ’’Never Forget’’ refrain and
put it into action to honor her friend Bob and
all who perished. Tricia has also been in-
volved in helping the Capitol Concerts that
take place on the Hill every year on Memorial
Day and the Fourth of July. All Americans who
enjoy these patriotic events can thank Tricia
for working overtime to ensure their success.
Tricia loves her country and everything Dis-
ney. There is also no bigger fan of Bruce
Springsteen, Tom Selleck or Joe Namath. But
nothing in her life comes close to her love for
her two children: Shannon and Patrick. They
are an incredibly close and loving family,
which can be attested to by me and my Chief
of Staff who can’t help but overhear regular
calls from each of the kids that always end
with, ‘‘I love you.’’ I won’t say that these calls
happen too frequently, but I have developed a
nervous tick whenever I hear her cell phone
ring tone. Seriously though, Tricia’s love for
and dedication to her children are a testament
to her fine character. I will deeply miss her
and her selflessness, loyalty and impassioned
devotion to supporting me and my office. I
look forward to my continued friendship with
Tricia and wish her, Shannon, and Patrick, the
very best in all their future endeavors. God-
speed.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 125TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THROOP’S INCOR-
PORATION AS A BOROUGH
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the Borough of Throop, Penn-
sylvania for its quasquicentennial year. Throop
celebrated 125 years of being incorporated on
April 16, 2019.
The borough was named after one of its
most influential residents, Dr. Benjamin H.
Throop, who settled in the county in the fall of
1840. He became an active figure in the com-
munity, buying real estate and advocating for
the separation of Throop and Dickson City
Borough. Dr. Throop also served in the mili-
tary during the Civil War, and at the time he
was one of the wealthiest figures in the area.
Throop originally applied to become inde-
pendent of Dickson City Borough in 1888, but
the subdivision failed. Refusing to back down,
the community banded together to continue to
circulate petitions. Among the many reasons
driving the residents’ motivation to become
their own, independent borough was a dispute
over schools and the desire to have their own
schooling system. In 1893, the petition was
granted, and the borough was officially incor-
porated on April 16, 1894.
The Throop family continued to be a driving
force behind the borough’s success. The
Throop Hose Company 1 was organized in
1894 and named after Dr. Throop’s son, Dr.
George S. Throop. The borough building was
completed in 1895 on land donated by Dr.
Throop, Dr. Pancoast, and Eli K. Price. Once
incorporated, Throop had a population of
1,639 with 266 dwellings, 9 hotels, a small
number of businesses, two churches, a col-
liery, and a school.
Like many communities in Northeastern
Pennsylvania, Throop’s coal mining industry
was the principal industry in the region for
decades. Throop has the distinction of being
the site of the first anthracite coal mined in
Lackawanna County, which was taken from
the Anderson farm by Willian Wurts in 1814.
Throughout its notable 125-year history,
Throop has established an impressive public
school system and has continued to celebrate
its religious heritage. The borough has also
shown its incredible resilience in the face of
devastating floods from Hurricanes Diane,
Agnes, and Gloria.
Today, Throop is a vibrant community with
around 3,900 residents and many industries
and businesses that have taken the place of
coal mining. Annual traditions and celebrations
for children like the Santa Parade and Tree
Lighting make Throop an inviting and wel-
coming place to live and visit. Throop’s rich
history and a tight knit community make it the
flourishing borough it is today.

Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I include

a writer for the Capital Gazette in Annapolis
Maryland.
[From the Baltimore Sun]
WENDI WINTERS, A PROLIFIC WRITER FOR THE
CAPITAL ENJOYED SHARING STORIES ABOUT
LOCAL RESIDENTS
(By Jacques Kelly)
Wendi Winters, a feature writer for The
Capital and The Maryland Gazette who ear-
lier had been a public relations executive in
Manhattan, died Thursday in the attack at
the Annapolis newspapers’ office.
She was 65 and lived in Edgewater.
Wendy Anne Winters—known throughout
the community as ‘‘Wendi’’—was born in
Coronado, Calif., the daughter of Leigh
Cosart Winters, a Navy commander and real
estate agent, and his wife, Dorothy
Breuninger Grigsby, who had worked as a
Capitol Hill secretary and was in the visi-
tors’ gallery in December 1941 when Presi-
dent Franklin D. Roosevelt asked Congress
for a declaration of war on Japan.
She attended Saint Rita’s School in Alex-
andria, Va. and was a 1971 graduate of the old
St. Mary’s Academy, a high school also in
Alexandria.
‘‘She vividly recollected her semi-nomadic
childhood as a Navy brat,’’ said her daugh-
ter, Winters Leigh Geimer. ‘‘Her fondest
childhood memories were of her family’s
time in Turkey when her father was a naval
attache with the American Embassy in
Istanbul. She spent most of her time getting
in trouble with the local residents and ex-
ploring off-limits places.’’
‘‘Our mother showed an aptitude for art
and writing. At age 10, she wrote a poem for
then-President John F. Kennedy and she re-
ceived a personal response with photographs
from his secretary, Evelyn Lincoln,’’ said her
son, Phoenix Winters Geimer. ‘‘She kept the
photograph near her desk and it has been in
the house as long I can remember. She had a
couple of recollections of President Kennedy
coming into her church.’’
She obtained a bachelor of fine arts degree
with a specialty in fashion design from Vir-
ginia Commonwealth University and later
went to New York City on a fellowship to the
Tobé-Coburn School for Fashion Careers. She
was class president at the school and grad-
uated with honors.
She remained active in alumni circles at
Virginia Commonwealth, and was invited
there to sit on critic panels of student work
at university fashion shows.
In a resume, Ms. Winters said most of her
career was in public relations—backed by ex-
perience in fashion retailing, wholesaling,
textiles, marketing, advertising, design and
promotion. She created and directed cam-
paigns for two ‘‘international public rela-
tions firms and had her own successful fash-
ion public relations, advertising, special
events [and] runway show production firm
for seven years,’’ her resume said.
She lived in the Gramercy Park section of
New York City and later moved to
Montclair, N.J.
‘‘In her New York days her pay often in-
cluded some of the clothing she was pro-
moting,’’ said her daughter, a Purdue Uni-
versity student who is a naval officer can-
didate. ‘‘She had a fairly large wardrobe be-
cause she didn’t believe in throwing things

1980s had never ended.’’
Her son said Ms. Winters routinely cor-
responded with figures of the era—including
Patty Hearst, Robin Leach, Michael Douglas,
the Trumps, Christian Lacroix, Oscar de la
Renta, Donna Karan, Iman, Keith Haring,
Neil Sedaka, Leroy Neiman, Regis Philbin,
Cybill Shepherd, Lionel Hampton and Sally
Jessy Raphael.
‘‘She regularly ran into Andy Warhol and
Salvador Dali on the street,’’ said her son.
In 1990, she won the Golden Apple Award,
presented by the New York City Chapter of
the Public Relations Society of America, for
a campaign she orchestrated for the Poly-
ester Council of America.
In 1986 she married Tod Geimer, who built
computer networks for banks.
He suggested a change of pace and less hec-
tic life in the Annapolis area. They left New
Jersey and moved to Arnold in 1999. They
later lived in Cape St. Claire.
‘‘My mother always needed to be doing
something,’’ her son said. ‘‘She started writ-
ing for small local publications.
‘‘Her day’s schedule was filled with so
many events,’’ he said. ‘‘You could plan for
her showing up late, late—but with a great
story to tell. Her daily routine was to wake
up at 5:30 a.m. and work and work and work.
At midnight she went to bed.’’
She wrote on a freelance basis for The Cap-
ital and later joined the publication full-
time. She often took her own photographs.
Ms. Winters wrote three weekly columns:
Around Broadneck, Teen of the Week and
Home of the Week.
‘‘My mother learned to type on a manual
typewriter and she had a heavy touch. She
could wear away the letters on a keyboard.
She also typed very fast,’’ said her daughter.
‘‘She also wrote fast.’’
She had written for many other publica-
tions, including Waterfront Living and In-
side Annapolis Magazine, and wrote theater
criticism for Theatre Spotlight and The Re-
view and the DC Metro Theatre Arts website.
She was a Helen Hayes Awards nominator for
two terms.
She was named honorary vice president of
her father’s Naval Academy Class of 1940.
Family members said she organized the
class’s 70th reunion.
Ms. Winters had also been a Girl Scout
leader, a church youth adviser and ran an an-
nual Red Cross Blood Drive. She was also a
cat fancier and enjoyed roller skating ses-
sions at Wheels Skating Center in Odenton.
‘‘Wendi was always the same as the first
day I met her in high school—we were both
cast in ‘Witness for the Prosecution,’ ’’ said
Paul Donnelly, a friend who lives in Hono-
lulu, Hawaii.
‘‘She was tall, elegant, self-possessed and
dynamic,’’ Mr. Donnelly said. ‘‘She lived life
to the fullest and was not one to sit around
and watch television. Her writing was metic-
ulous and reflected her personality. She was
compassionate about the people she wrote
about. It was never a chore for her to write
The Teen of the Week column.’’
A celebration of life will held at noon to 3
p.m. Saturday at the Maryland Hall for the
Creative Arts, 801 Chase Street in Annapolis.
A reception will follow from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.
at the Unitarian Universalist Church of An-
napolis, where she was a member.
In addition to her son and daughter, sur-
vivors include two other daughters, Montana
Winters Geimer, a Naval Academy graduate
who is stationed in Pensacola, Fla., and
Summerleigh Winters Geimer of Edgewater,
a home remodeling manager; three sisters,
Sandra Winters of Key Biscayne, Fla., Dana
Rengers of Alexandria, Va., and Debra Win-

HONORING THE SERVICE OF MAS-
TER SERGEANT DONCARLOS
PAGAN
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Master Sergeant Doncarlos Pagan
who served his country in the United States
Army for 28 years. Master Sergeant Pagan’s
service in Afghanistan and his work for the
State of Arizona and the United States Army
exemplify his strong devotion to duty and
country.
While in Afghanistan, Master Sergeant Pa-
gan’s experience as a construction engineer
enabled the 158th Infantry Battalion to plan,
and build, construction projects that included
bridges and roads that enabled villagers in
Najil, Afghanistan to bypass destroyed roads.
In addition, he developed an artillery battery
munitions storage bunker for the Afghan Army
and he helped train Afghan Combat Engineer
Soldiers in Force Protection Operations. His
expertise in construction and developing force
protection efforts was recognized by the 82nd
Airborne, All American 6, General Rodriguez
and earned him a Combat Action Badge. At
times coming under direct enemy fire, Master
Sergeant Pagan held firm and completed the
mission.
Master Sergeant Pagan was also crucial in
the development of planning for multiple con-
struction projects valued at over $2.5 million to
support multiple counties, government agen-
cies and the State of Arizona.
Madam Speaker, this is only a fraction of
the numerous accomplishments that span the
28 years of Master Sergeant Pagan’s service
to our country. His leadership has left a pro-
found legacy that will continue to positively im-
pact the United States Army for years to
come. His proudest accomplishment however
is his wonderful family. He and his wife
Shawna have 4 children and 8 beautiful
grandchildren.
I thank Master Sergeant Pagan for his serv-
ice and leadership to our country. May his
leadership continue to inspire generations of
men and women who serve in the United
States Army.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE LIFE OF
PAUL PIMENTEL
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in recognition of the life of Paul Pimentel, a
resident of Edgartown, Massachusetts who
leaves a legacy of service to his community.
Paul was born and raised in Quincy and later
Braintree, setting himself apart early as a star
athlete and student body president at Brain-
tree High School before enrolling at Harvard
University.
After graduation, Paul fulfilled his childhood
dream of enlisting as a Naval officer, serving
two combat tours in Vietnam as Chief Engi-
neer of the USS Berkeley. Upon leaving the
service and taking time to reflect on his time
in the service and his dreams for the country,
he became an advocate for Vietnam Veterans
Against the War. He went on to achieve nota-
ble success in public service, becoming the
youngest Massachusetts Deputy Secretary of
State in the history of the office.
Looking for ways to assist as a private cit-
izen, Paul would end up at the forefront of cli-
mate science in the 1970s. He developed
Energistics in 1978 and Pequod Associates in
1980, breaking new ground to make conserva-
tion technology accessible before it was a
worldwide priority. Many of the energy saving
models he developed are now seen as indus-
try standard. The independent cooperative
Vineyard Power, his proudest professional
achievement, was supported by a thorough
community outreach campaign and would go
on to provide over 800 megawatts of offshore
wind power to the people of New England.
Sadly, Paul passed away on February 5,
2019. His commitment to the common good
will live on through a loving family and the
myriad projects he shaped. Madam Speaker, I
am proud to honor the life of Paul Pimentel. I
ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing
his many years of dedication to his community
and his country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E849
June 26, 2019
IN HONOR OF THE EXTRAOR-
DINARY LIFE OF BISHOP HARRY
L. SEAWRIGHT
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor the 133rd Elected and
Consecrated Bishop in the African Methodist
Episcopal Church, Bishop Harry L. Seawright.
Bishop Seawright has spent more than 37
years in ministry as presiding prelate of Ala-
bama’s 9th Episcopal District. On June 25,
2019, Bishop Seawright was invested and ele-
vated, becoming President of the African
Methodist Episcopal Church, a tremendous
and well-deserved honor within the church and
the community.
Bishop Seawright has been preparing for
this most recent and elevated recognition for
most of his life. A fourth-generation A.M.E.,
Bishop Seawright’s faith was nurtured from an
early age, both at home with his family and
within his first church, Prodigal A.M.E. in
Swansea, South Carolina. Alongside his faith,
Bishop Seawright ingrained an innate work
ethic after seeing his mother widowed when
he was only five years old. Born to a family of
sharecroppers and lacking financial resources,
Bishop Seawright’s mother worked tirelessly to
care for her seven young children. Like his
mother’s, Bishop Seawright’s relentless work
ethic, buoyed by his unflappable faith, was
and still is, the driving force behind his many
accomplishments.
Having witnessed first-hand the challenges
that his mother faced in attempting to provide
for seven children with only a ninth grade edu-
cation, Bishop Seawright took his mother’s in-
sistence on education to heart, remaining in
South Carolina to earn his Bachelor’s Degree
in Business Administration from Benedict Col-
lege. He then continued on, earning his Mas-
ter of Divinity from Howard University School
of Divinity in Washington, D.C. Bishop
Seawright remains interested and invested in
many businesses in addition to his work within
the church.
It was not just education that Bishop
Seawright’s mother emphasized as a crucial
guiding force for future success. Bishop
Seawright’s mother instilled in her son a deep
and unwavering faith, which he, in turn, saw
mirrored within her, even during the family’s
darkest struggles. ‘‘My mother was a praying
woman,’’ Bishop Seawright said. ‘‘She had a
lot of faith and courage.’’ That faith and cour-
age remained evident over the course of many
moves, many job changes and many days of
wondering if and how she would be able to
feed her children. Nevertheless, Bishop
Seawright’s mother never gave up her faith in
God’s will, nor did her son.
In 1976, Bishop Seawright accepted his call
to ministry, and in 1977 was admitted to the
South Carolina Central Annual Conference, by
the late Bishop Frank M. Reid, II. He was later
ordained as an Itinerant Deacon in the Wash-
ington Annual Conference in 1979 by the late
Bishop Henry W. Murph and as an Itinerant
Elder in 1981 by Bishop John Hurst Adams.
In 1978, Bishop Seawright served as Interim
Pastor of St. Stephen A.M.E. Church in St.
Matthews, S.C., as well as staff minister at
Reid Temple A.M.E. Church in Washington,
D.C. In 1981 he received his first pastoral ap-
pointment, to Payne Memorial A.M.E. Church
in Jessup, MD, where he served until 1983.
Between 1983 and 1986, Bishop Seawright
served as pastor of Hemingway Temple
A.M.E. Church in Jessup, MD, before being
assigned to Union Bethel African Methodist
Episcopal Church in Brandywine, MD.
Bishop Seawright served Union Bethel Afri-
can Methodist Episcopal Church for thirty
years, longer than anyone else in the church’s
history. During his tenure, he led the church in
a $1.6 million construction project, building a
gorgeous sanctuary that will serve as a re-
minder of his commitment to his faith and to
Union Bethel for many generations to come.
Early in his ministerial journey, Bishop
Seawright met his future wife, Sherita Moon
Seawright. He was still a sophomore in col-
lege when they met, unaware that she would
soon be his wife, partner, inspiration and sup-
port. The two married in 1982, and have been
blessed with two beautiful children, Shari Ni-
cole and Harry Matthew.
After 30 years of service, in 2016 Bishop
Seawright left Union Bethel and prepared to
transplant his life and family to Alabama, hav-
ing accepted an appointment in Alabama’s 9th
Episcopal District. Moving to Birmingham, AL
provided Bishop Seawright fresh opportunity to
focus on engaging and mentoring other pas-
tors throughout the region. Further, Bishop
Seawright took advantage of the opportunity to
develop several new programs, including the
Life Center at Daniel Payne Plaza.
The Daniel Payne Plaza is an invaluable
community resource, providing struggling com-
munity members with the opportunity to earn
a GED and gain certifications in a multitude of
vocational areas, including food preparation
and construction. The program’s goal is to
transform how the 9th district serves not only
the church, but the community. Thanks to the
challenges he faced throughout his childhood,
and the resilience he witnessed within his
mother, Bishop Seawright is uniquely posi-
tioned to understand the value of quality edu-
cation, and as such, is determined to provide
educational opportunities to all those he
serves.
Bishop Seawright’s 37 years of tireless serv-
ice have earned him a rightfully exalted posi-
tion within the community. His most recent ap-
pointment, to President of the African Meth-
odist Episcopal Church, further solidifies his
impressive and well-deserved reputation as a
leader, mentor and spiritual guide. He has
given more than can ever be repaid, and both
the church and community owe him a tremen-
dous debt of gratitude. On a personal note, I
want to thank Bishop Seawright for his contin-
ued support and encouragement of my home
church, the Historic Brown Chapel AME
Church in Selma, AL.
On behalf of the 7th Congressional District,
the State of Alabama and this nation, I ask my
colleagues to join me in celebrating the many
accomplishments of Bishop Harry L.
Seawright. We pay tribute to his distinguished
career for the betterment of the State of Ala-
bama and extend deep appreciation for his ex-
emplary service as the Presiding Prelate of
the 9th Episcopal District.

IN SUPPORT OF CERTAIN
PROVISIONS OF H.R. 2740
HON. DAVID P. JOYCE
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I rise
in support of those provisions of H.R. 2740
that reflect the President’s proposals to con-
tinue funding for Substance Abuse Prevention
and Treatment Block Grants and State Opioid
Response Grants, two programs under the
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration.
Substance use disorders have ravaged
large parts of this country, including parts of
my home state of Ohio.
Madam Speaker, over the next 24 hours,
about 130 Americans will die from an opioid-
related overdose, close to 84 infants in Ohio
will be born suffering from the horrific symp-
toms of drug withdrawal, and over 20 million
people across the country will continue to bat-
tle with addiction.
In 2017, it is estimated that over 19.7 million
Americans battled a substance use disorder.
That’s not to mention the approximately $740
billion annually that drug abuse and addiction
costs American society in lost workplace pro-
ductivity, health care expenses, and crime-re-
lated costs.
There is no one-size-fits-all solution to this
crisis. Both addiction and addiction treatment
are extremely complex. However, Substance
Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grants
and State Opioid Response Grants have
helped countless communities across the
country. To be sure that these funds are being
used efficiently, they must be directed toward
those programs which employ an evidenced-
based approach to treatment and recovery. In
particular, community-based recovery support
programs, like SMART Recovery in my own
district, have proven crucial in encouraging
those suffering from addiction to stay on the
proper path to recovery.
One of my top priorities has been ensuring
the federal funding Congress has provided to
combat the opioid epidemic effectively sup-
ports the life-saving work our local commu-
nities carry out on the front lines of this crisis.
While there is still work to be done, it is en-
couraging to see that Substance Abuse Pre-
vention and Treatment Block Grants and State
Opioid Response Grants are helping organiza-
tions in Northeast Ohio and across the country
save lives.
That is why I am proud to rise in support of
these provisions.

HONORING FRED AND BETTY
ROEDER
HON. LARRY BUCSHON
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. BUCSHON. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to ask all my colleagues to join me in
honoring two outstanding Hoosiers—Fred and
Betty Roeder—on the occasion of their 70th
wedding anniversary.
Fred and Betty epitomize what it means to
be a Hoosier—kind and gracious; with big,
warm hearts; and a love for their state and
country that is borne out by their commitment
to bettering the lives of their neighbors and
community.
Fred and Betty—high school sweethearts—
were married seventy years ago this month,
on June 30, 1949, at Evansville Emanuel Lu-
theran Church.
Fred Roeder served in the U.S. Army
(1952–54) and concluded active service as a
Corporal. He served 6 years in the Army Re-
serve and was honorably discharged in 1960.
A Korean War veteran, Fred remains proud of
his service to our nation, and that of the many
friends he made while in the Army. He worked
at Dale Sales warehouse and later at Niehaus
Industrial Parts in Evansville.
Betty Roeder is a graduate of Benjamin
Bosse High School in Evansville. She dedi-
cated much of her time to leading music and
Christian education programs at local Lutheran
churches. Betty was beloved by her students
and took great pride in her work.
I came to know the Roeders at Our Re-
deemer Lutheran Church in Evansville, where
we have worshiped together for many years.
Despite moving to the Indianapolis-area to be
closer to family members, the Roeders remain
devoted members at Our Redeemer Lutheran
Church.
Fred and Betty are the proud parents of
their son Michael F. Roeder and daughter-in-
law Lee Ann, and their grandchildren—John
and granddaughter-in-law Taylor, Tim and Kurt
Roeder. They celebrated their historic mile-
stone a bit early this year with a small group
of family and friends on June 22.
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to join me in extending to the Roe-
ders the well-wishes and congratulations of
the U.S. House of Representatives on the oc-
casion of their 70th wedding anniversary.

I inadvertently cast a ‘‘yea’’ vote on roll call
No. 372, on an amendment during consider-

division of H.R. 3055. I would like to change
my vote on the amendment to ‘‘nay.’’
The North Atlantic right whale is a critically
endangered species iconic to the Eastern sea-

powering the National Marine Fisheries Serv-
ice (NMFS) to implement regulations to protect
this species based on scientific, consensus
recommendations, not disarming the agency.
The North Atlantic right whale Risk Reduction
Decision Support Tool is a critical piece of
NOAA and NMFS’ regulatory framework, and
preventing its use undermines their decision-
making process.

IN RECOGNITION OF MR. OTTIE
JACKSON MOORE, SR.
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to use this time to recognize my con-
stituent, Mr. Ottie Jackson Moore, Sr. Born in
Gladys, Virginia on December 26, 1928, Mr.
Moore has committed much of his life and ca-
reer to service of the Commonwealth of Vir-
ginia and our nation. Mr. Moore has protected
our nation abroad, having served in the United
States Army, both as an active and reserve
member, in addition to protecting the United
States at home, as a member of the Virginia
State Police and a seven-term Sheriff of Caro-
line Country, Virginia.
In 1951, during the Korean War, Mr. Moore
was drafted into the United States Army, going
on to serve three years of active duty. Mr.
Moore completed basic training school, basic
schools of enlisted training and the U.S.
Army’s Officer Candidate School (OCS) at
Fort Bliss Texas in July 1952. After being
commissioned a Second Lieutenant, Mr.
Moore was assigned to an anti-aircraft unit as
a commanding officer. After three years of ac-
tive service, Mr. Moore joined the U.S. Army
Reserves.
In the Reserves, Mr. Moore served as a
commanding officer of a quartermaster unit
and in several positions within the United
States Army Reserves (USAR) School, includ-
ing four years as Assistant Commandant.
Over the course of his military service, Mr.
Moore received the Meritorious Service Medal
on two separate occasions. Mr. Moore would
go on to serve a total of thirty years in the
United States Army Reserves, completing his
service having earned the rank of Colonel.
After graduating first in his class in 1955
from the Virginia State Police, Mr. Moore
would go on to serve and protect the Com-
monwealth of Virginia for many years. After
being elected Sheriff of Caroline County, Vir-
ginia in November 1963, Mr. Moore would
serve seven terms until January 1992. In addi-
tion, Mr. Moore held several office level posi-
tions as a member of the Virginia Sheriff’s As-
sociation, including President in 1975. Mr.
Moore has actively advised the Virginia Gen-
eral Assembly on the passage of several bills
related to advancements in training of local
law enforcement personnel and was a found-
ing member of the board that led to the cre-
ation of the Rappahannock Regional Training
Academy in 1977.
Mr. Moore exemplifies the best of the First
District of Virginia, with a life committed to
service to his country and our commonwealth.
Mr. Moore’s life of patriotism, service, and
selflessness should stand as an example to
the ideals that make the First District, the
Commonwealth of Virginia and the United
States of America great.

INTRODUCTION OF THE PASSPORT
ASSISTANCE FOR DISADVAN-
TAGED STUDENTS ACT OF 2019
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to introduce a bill that will hope-
fully be the first step in ensuring that students
from all backgrounds are able to take advan-
tage of study abroad programs offered by their
universities.
As we see a new class of students grad-
uate, I’ve noticed that some of these students
are lacking the global skills needed to excel in
today’s workplace. Exposure to the world’s di-
verse cultures and traditions allows oneself to
be more understanding and comfortable in a
rapidly transforming world while also devel-
oping a greater appreciation for the United
States and our shared culture.
Over 80 percent of incoming freshmen hope
to study abroad as a part of the college expe-
rience; however, due to obligations such as
coursework, employment and affordability,
only 10 percent end up taking advantage of
this incredible opportunity offered by many
universities. Minority students are greatly
underrepresented within this population.
The Passport Assistance for Disadvantaged
Students Act of 2019 would establish a pilot
program between the Department of Edu-
cation, Department of State, and 3 public uni-
versities, including 1 HBCU and 1 Hispanic
Serving Institution. Students at each of these
schools who receive Pell Grants and are ac-
cepted for a study abroad program would
have the opportunity to receive a United
States Passport at no cost. The public univer-
sity would cover the upfront cost and the De-
partment of State would reimburse the institu-
tion after they’ve reported relevant information
to the Department of Education.
With this bill, we take a step forward in
breaking down systematic barriers that prevent
certain students from studying abroad while in
college. The opportunity to travel and learn in
a foreign country offers students the chance to
advance their studies in a globalized environ-
ment.
Madam Speaker, I believe that students
should have equal access to opportunities like
study abroad regardless of race or socio-
economic status, which is why I am proud to
introduce this bill.

work of Tampa attorney, Michael Bedke, who
will receive the Florida Bar Foundation’s 2019
Medal of Honor Award this week. The Medal
of Honor is the Foundation’s highest honor.
Michael Bedke works to ensure the wheels
of justice turn for everyone. He has devoted a
large portion of his distinguished legal career
in service to his community and his country.
He has provided extensive pro bono service
and advocacy for AIDS patients, domestic vio-
lence survivors and individuals in need. He
also has maintained an unfailing commitment
to improve the lives of veterans. He spear-
headed the ‘‘No Place Like Home’’ initiative
which establishes permanent supportive hous-
ing for neighbors in need of mental health
services or who are at risk of chronic home-
lessness.
Throughout his life, Mike always has recog-
nized his duty to serve his neighbors and
country in a wide variety of ways. He is con-
stantly thinking of ways to meet unmet legal
needs and has a unique ability to develop ef-
fective plans for meeting those needs.
As a young lawyer, Mike took on pro bono
cases to represent persons with AIDS in the
1980s, a time when the general public was
both fearful and uneducated about the dis-
ease. True to his style of leading by example,
by taking on these cases and serving on the
board of the Tampa AIDS Network he encour-
aged colleagues to take similar action.
After Category 5 Hurricane Andrew struck
Florida in 1992, Mike worked to pass Good
Samaritan legislation that removed an impedi-
ment to lawyers providing pro bono help to
disaster survivors. He also led legal relief ef-
forts in response to Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii,
the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal
Building in Oklahoma City, and September 11.
He founded the Greater Access and Assist-
ance Project while chair of the American Bar
Association’s Young Lawyer’s Division, mod-
eling it after the Courthouse Assistance
Project he created at home as a member of
Bay Area Legal Services’ board of directors.
Mike has worked to empower domestic vio-
lence survivors for more than 25 years. He
was appointed to the National Advisory Com-
mittee on Violence Against Women in 2002
and has served on numerous boards working
to improve access and support for survivors.
He worked with the Women’s Caucus of the
Peruvian Parliament to draft model domestic
violence legislation.
Mike received his bachelor’s degree with
high honors from the University of Florida in
Gainesville and served as student body presi-
dent. He then completed his juris doctorate
with honors from the University of Florida. He
developed a program at his alma mater to re-
cruit and retain minority law students. He has
also served as an adjunct professor at Stetson
College of Law.
Close to my heart and so many in the
Tampa Bay area is Bay Area Legal Services
that provides legal aid to people who need it.
As president of the Board of Directors for Bay
Area Legal Services, in 2015, Mike spear-
headed a fundraising effort that created a
$400,000 endowment for a veterans program.
He also led the development and implementa-
tion of Bay Area’s ‘‘No Place Like Home
Project’’ to provide pro bono help to low-in-
come homeowners experiencing title issues.
He is a partner in the Tampa office of the
distinguished international law firm, DLA Piper.
While Mike is much sought after in his specific
area of practice, he was called to do more in
service to his community and country—and we
are better for it and grateful for his vision and
commitment.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the citizens of
America, the State of Florida and my neigh-
bors across our hometown, I am proud to
mark Mike Bedke’s lifetime of leadership.

TRIBUTE TO MOLLY GRAHAM
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN
OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to pay tribute to a woman whose brav-
ery and perseverance exemplify a significant
American story. It is fitting that during this July
4th, as we celebrate our nation’s birthday, citi-
zens of South Carolina and the descendants
of Molly Graham will be dedicating a bridge
over the Combahee River in Colleton County,
South Carolina in her honor. Although seven
generations removed, Molly Graham’s story is
inspiring and instructive for all of us.
Molly Graham was enslaved on the Cypress
Plantation in Green Pond, South Carolina dur-
ing the Civil War. Her husband and brother
were killed during the final months of the war
when Confederate soldiers executed male
slaves to prevent them from enlisting in the
Union Army. Ms. Graham and her daughters
escaped after Confederate troops raided their
plantation and threatened to burn it to the
ground.
She and her daughters traveled 16 miles on
foot to the safety of a Union camp in Beaufort.
Along the treacherous journey, they had to
crawl across a plank over the Combahee
River because the bridge had been destroyed
by fire. They hid from Confederate troops dur-
ing the day and traveled under the cover of
darkness at night. Ms. Graham let faith, ‘‘the
substance of things hoped for, the evidence of
things unseen,’’ guide her.
After spending several months in the refuge
of the Union camp, Ms. Graham and her
daughters returned to Green Pond. The
daughters eventually married, and they
worked together, pooled their resources and
bought several hundred acres of land. The
family raised chickens, turkeys and vegetables
on the farm and sold their goods at the
Walterboro farmers market.
Ms. Graham also served as a naturopathic
herb doctor who treated both former slaves
and plantation owners without prejudice or
malice. She added rooms to her home to treat
patients overnight, that served as the only
‘‘hospital’’ to ever exist in Green Pond. Today,
she and many of her progeny are buried at
the historic Hickory Hill Cemetery close to the
banks of the Combahee River.
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in
celebrating the life of Molly Graham and the
contributions of seven generations of her off-
spring in the Bryant, Pinckney and Singleton
families. Theirs is a true story of resilience and
triumph that exemplifies the diversity of the
American experience. I applaud the descend-
ants’ efforts to dedicate the Molly Graham Me-
morial Bridge that crosses her beloved
Combahee River and to continue her legacy of
giving back to the community through their
family’s non-profit foundation.

IN RECOGNITION OF PATRICK &
DENISE GOGGINS’ 50TH WEDDING
ANNIVERSARY
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I would like to
take this opportunity to congratulate Patrick
and Denise Goggins on the occasion of their
50th wedding anniversary. This July 4th marks
a special milestone for this couple and their
family, and it is my pleasure to recognize it as
such.
Pat and Denise were married on July 4,
1969, but their story begins even four years
earlier when they met as high school sweet-
hearts. Their life of love, marriage and family
is truly heartwarming and worthy of recogni-
tion. From the purchase of their first home
through President Johnson’s Housing and
Urban Development program for first-time
homebuyers, to the births of their three daugh-
ters (Bridget, Erin, and Molly), and then the
gifts of grandchildren, the Goggins exemplify
the spirit of hardworking American families
across the country.
Marriage is an institution undeniably linked
to the fabric of our society. It is a union cele-
brated not only by the two partners, but by
their friends and family alike. The nuptial cele-
brations of Patrick and Denise were no excep-
tion and are certainly still not today. Their mar-
riage will be celebrated by close to 200 people
in Cape Cod, Massachusetts this July 4th and
will certainly be filled with the same warmth of
the original, humble wedding reception of five
decades prior. I extend my personal greetings
to all those that will gather together that day
in celebration of Pat and Denise.
Madam Speaker, once again, it is my pleas-
ure to recognize the milestone of Patrick and
Denise Goggins’ 50th wedding anniversary.
Their commitment to each other and their fam-
ily is truly uplifting. I wish them all the best in
their future endeavors as they continue their
wonderful life together for years to come.

HONORING LENORA LAPIDUS
HON. YVETTE D. CLARKE
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam Speak-
er, as Vice Chair of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, I would like to honor
the legacy of the beloved Lenora Lapidus for
her steadfast dedication to making this nation
a better place than she found it. Lenora was
a public servant and civil rights leader pas-
sionate about creating equal opportunity for
marginalized groups. She was a leader in our
community who used her voice to create fair
opportunities for women and girls. Lenora
began her career in service as an ACLU in-
tern, and later became the legal director of the
ACLU of New Jersey, leading the Women’s
Rights Project for almost two decades. From
ensuring that our nation’s military is open and
accepting to all Americans to creating a
means to combat gender-based violence,
Lenora won cases on behalf of the ACLU that
have elevated our society.
Lenora had a vital role in the Be HEARD
Act, aimed at ending and creating con-
sequences for workplace harassment. Her
policies and initiatives were always inclusive
and addressed the needs of communities that
often times did not have a voice. Lenora’s leg-
acy will never be forgotten, and she will al-
ways be remembered as a trailblazer who
fought for equality and justice. I thank her for
her commitment to this nation and offer my
prayers and condolences to the many experi-
encing the pain of this devastating loss.

IN RECOGNITION OF POLICE CHIEF
MATTHEW CLANCY
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in recognition of the retirement and many
laudable accomplishments of Police Chief
Matthew Clancy of the Duxbury Police Depart-
ment.
A native of Massachusetts’ South Shore,
Matthew Clancy obtained his master’s degree
in Criminal Justice from Boston University. He
is a graduate of the FBI National Academy, as
well as the Command Training Program of the
New England Institute of Law Enforcement
Management. After several seasonal special
appointments, he began his full-time career in
law enforcement with the Mashpee Police De-
partment, serving there until his appointment
as Chief of Police in Plympton, Massachusetts
in 2002. He served faithfully in that position
until 2010, when he was named Police Chief
of the Duxbury Police Department.
Chief Clancy has gone on to protect and
serve his community in a variety of ways be-
yond his work as Chief of Police. He serves
as the President of the Massachusetts Police
Accreditation Commission and has been a
Past President of both the Plymouth County
Police Chief’s Association and Old Colony
Special Operations Group. He was integral in
the formation of the Metropolitan Law Enforce-
ment Council Marine Unit, where he now
serves as Control Chief.
Chief Clancy has dedicated his life to serv-
ing his community and championing the cause
of better policing, and I wish him many years
of happiness and relaxation with his family, in-
cluding his wife Holly, and their four children,
Eden, Matthew, Marissa and Alyssa.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor Mat-
thew Clancy and his commitment to ensuring
the safety of his community. I ask that my col-
leagues join me in recognizing his hard work
and dedication as he celebrates his well-
earned retirement.

HONORING REBECCA A. SMITH OF
THE CAPITAL GAZETTE
HON. JOHN P. SARBANES
OF MARYLAND
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, I include
in the RECORD an obituary of Rebecca A.
Smith, an advertising assistant for the Capital
Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland.
[From the Baltimore Sun]
REBECCA A. SMITH, CAPITAL GAZETTE ADVER-
TISING ASSISTANT WHO HELD FAMILY AND
FRIENDS AT CENTER OF HER LIFE
(By Frederick N. Rasmussen)
Rebecca Ann Smith made sure family,
friends and workplace colleagues were the
center of her life. They brought her joy, and
those who knew her say she returned it
abundantly.
‘‘Everyone loved her,’’ said a cousin,
Tammy Kaskel of Dundalk. ‘‘Becca was al-
ways patient, supportive and never jealous
or envious. She’d do anything for anybody
and didn’t have a mean bone in her body.’’
‘‘She had such promise in life,’’ said an
uncle, Thomas A. Malinowski. ‘‘She was a
good kid and never got into trouble.’’
Ms. Smith, who worked as an advertising
sales assistant for the Capital Gazette, lost
her life in the June 28 attack on the news-
paper’s Annapolis office. She was 34 and lived
in Dundalk.
Ms. Smith was born in Baltimore and
raised in North Point Village and later Fort
Howard.
The daughter of Richard Smith and Beth
Ann Malinowski, she was raised by her ma-
ternal grandparents, William Malinowski, a
driver for County Ride, and Catherine
Malinowski, a homemaker.
‘‘I was very young then. I don’t know what
I would have done without them,’’ said her
mother, now Beth Rittenour, of Warren,
Ohio. ‘‘Rebecca was such a beautiful person,
and she’ll always be in my heart forever.’’
Ms. Smith attended Battle Grove Elemen-
tary School and graduated in 2001 from Spar-
rows Point High School, where she excelled
in field hockey, ran cross country and was an
avid duckpin bowler.
‘‘She also loved community theater and
played the character A Star to Be in ‘Annie.’
She was in middle school then,’’ said Ms.
Kaskel, who conducts a performing arts
camp and works with special-needs children.
‘‘She had such a great voice, was very sup-
portive, and wanted to see others succeed.’’
Mr. Malinowski, who also lives in Dundalk,
recalled his niece being a Pink Floyd fan
when she was little. ‘‘I’d put on a Pink Floyd
tape and she’d scoot her chair up to the TV.’’
He said she also enjoyed camping.
‘‘She always wanted to go with me,’’ he
said. ‘‘I’d take the neighborhood kids and
other nieces and nephews, and we had a lot of
fun.’’
‘‘Our grandparents were very proud of
Becca because she was the first person in our
family to go to college,’’ Ms. Kaskel said.
‘‘She was a graduate of Villa Julie College,
where she earned a degree in marketing.’’
Ms. Smith held marketing positions with
Press Box and the old Maryland General Hos-
pital—now the University of Maryland Med-
ical Center Midtown Campus—before joining
the Capital Gazette last November as an ad-
vertising assistant.
‘‘I found her to be a person of tremendous
potential, and it is sad that we will never see
her live up to that,’’ said Marty Padden, the
newspaper’s advertising director. ‘‘We’re just
heart-broken.’’
Ms. Smith suffered from endometriosis, a
tissue disorder, and referred to herself on
Facebook as an ‘‘Endo Warrior.’’
‘‘It was very debilitating, but she still
came to the office and soldiered on through
it,’’ Mr. Padden said. ‘‘She had a great sense
of humor and was so charming.’’
Ms. Smith met and fell in love with
Dewayne Poling, and they were engaged to
be married. On Facebook, she called him her
‘‘softball fiance’’ and attended Mr. Poling’s
games and traveled to team tournaments.
She also wrote of Mr. Poling’s daughter from
an earlier relationship as being ‘‘the best kid
ever.’’
‘‘Becca wanted to get married and have her
own family,’’ Ms. Kaskel said. ‘‘When she
met Dewayne, he was what she had been
waiting for.’’
Kelli Peleska of Hanover, who played soft-
ball with Mr. Poling, told The Baltimore Sun
in a June 28 interview that Ms. Smith had
‘‘the biggest heart.’’
‘‘Not only was Rebecca our advertising as-
sistant, she grew to become a close friend of
mine,’’ said Eleni Stylianou, a colleague who
lives in Annapolis. ‘‘She was always so sweet
and willing to help. She was a loving future
stepmother to her fiance’s daughter.’’
‘‘She was always talking about her fiance’s
daughter, about moving and her medical
issues. We talked every day,’’ said close
friend Selene San Felice of Baltimore, a Cap-
ital Gazette reporter who survived the shoot-
ing. ‘‘Rebecca was strong—that’s the first
word that comes to mind, and she was so
kind.’’
Her grandmother died in 2004 and her
grandfather in 2011. She was ‘‘devastated,’’
Mr. Malinowski said. ‘‘It hit her real hard.’’
Ms. Kaskel said she continually returned
to the center point of her life: her family.
‘‘She was always there at family events,
and always had been involved with my chil-
dren, who are now grown,’’ she said. ‘‘She
was godmother to my two daughters.
‘‘She’d go to their dance recitals; you
would never expected her not to be there,’’
Ms. Kaskel said. ‘‘She’d be there Christmas
Eve and Christmas morning to watch my
kids open their gifts.’’
A visitation for Ms. Smith will be held
from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday at the Duda-
Ruck Funeral Home, 7922 Wise Ave., Dun-
dalk, and again from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m., with a
memorial service following.
In addition to her parents, uncle, cousin
and fiance, Ms. Smith is survived by another
uncle, William Malinowski of Essex; a broth-
er, Steven Rittenour of Fredericksburg, Va.;
two sisters, Jamie Rittenour of Warren Ohio,
and Cindy Rittenour, also of Fredericksburg;
and numerous other cousins.

HONORING BARBARA KIM-HAGE-
MANN AS FIRST WOMAN TO
SERVE AS STATE COMMANDER
IN ANY MAJOR NEW JERSEY
VETERANS ORGANIZATION
HON. ANDY KIM
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, June 26, 2019
Mr. KIM. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Barbara Kim-Hagemann, who recently
made history by being the first woman elected
to the position of State Commander in any
major New Jersey veterans organization.
Barbara has dedicated her career to serving
her country and the veteran community in
New Jersey. She served in the U.S. Army for
eight years as an illustrator deployed to Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait during Desert Shield and
Desert Storm. After being discharged from the
Army, Barbara attended Georgian Court Col-
lege, and later began her work serving New
Jersey’s veterans. Barbara first started out
with the Ocean County Veterans Affairs in
Toms River, where she worked with veterans
and their families to help them secure health
care and disability benefits.
After joining the Jackson, NJ VFW Post
4703, Barbara became the first female Post
Commander in Ocean County, and later be-
came the first female District Commander.
She has also served on a number of VFW
state committees, including the Legislative
Committee, in an effort to advocate for vet-
erans, military personnel and families. Barbara
has remained a leader in the veterans com-
munity in our area, coordinating the Ocean
County Veterans Thanksgiving Food Drive and
Christmas Toy Drive, working as an instructor
at the Marine Corps ROTC Leadership and
Character Development Academy at Fort Dix,
and serving as the Grand Marshal for the
Point Pleasant Memorial Day Parade and
Toms River Veterans Day Parade.
For her years of service to the veterans
community in New Jersey, Barbara was recog-
nized twice by the New Jersey State Assem-
bly, and was inducted into the Jackson Town-
ship Hall of Fame. On June 22, 2019, Barbara
was installed as the State Commander of the
New Jersey VFW, becoming the first female to
ever hold that position.
The importance of the work that Barbara
has done throughout her career to help the
veterans community in New Jersey cannot be
understated. After serving in the U.S. Army,
Barbara returned home and went to work to
make sure that other servicemembers return-
ing home received quality care and resources
to live a comfortable life.
I would like to thank Barbara for the incred-
ible work she has done over the years, and I
look forward to working with her as the first fe-
male State Commander of a major New Jer-
sey veterans organization.
