Lord, in a complicated world it is

light of wisdom and direction for our
Members of Congress and their staff
teams today. The job of governing is in
no way easy or simple, but You have
gifted them for this moment and You
walk beside them come what may. It is
an amazing gift to know we are not
alone in these days. Thank You, Lord,

INTRODUCTION OF A JOINT RESO-
LUTION RELATING TO A NA-
TIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARED
BY THE PRESIDENT ON FEB-
RUARY 15, 2019
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 22, 2019
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, to
be clear, my introduction of this resolution of
disapproval should in no way be interpreted as
an indication that the President’s declaration
of an emergency, or his invocation of specific
statutory powers pursuant to that declaration,
is even lawful in the first place.
The Constitution provides Congress with the
power of the purse and expressly prohibits the
President from spending funds that Congress
has not appropriated. Here, Congress has not
authorized or appropriated funding to build a
wall on the southern border. Indeed, Congress
has repeatedly chosen not to do so in re-
sponse to the President’s multiple requests for
such funding since becoming President.
While my resolution disapproves and termi-
nates the President’s emergency declaration,
the record should be clear that I do not be-
lieve the President’s declaration, or his invoca-
tion of specific statutory powers pursuant to
that declaration, was lawful to begin with.

HONORING PASTOR PIERCE’S
SIXTH ANNIVERSARY AT MOUNT
ZION BAPTIST CHURCH OF
GREENSBORO
HON. MARK WALKER
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 22, 2019
Mr. WALKER. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Bishop Bryan J. Pierce’s sixth an-
niversary as the Senior Pastor and Chief Ex-
ecutive Officer of Mount Zion Baptist Church
of Greensboro. Beginning to preach at the age
of six and ordained by nineteen, Bishop Pierce
is a man after God’s own heart. It was in June
of 2011 that Bishop Pierce became the Chief
Administrative Officer at Mount Zion and
worked diligently until his elevation to Senior
Pastor on January 1, 2013. He strongly be-
lieves that he who serves the city, wins the
city, which is expressed through a Church-
wide campaign called No Greater Love, where
members of Mount Zion come together to
serve the Greensboro community. Also serv-
ing as 1st Assistant to 2nd Presiding Bishop,
Bishop Pierce is a noted songwriter, arranger
and producer. He successfully released his
first solo debut album, which reached No. 3 on
Billboard’s Top Gospel Albums Chart by cap-
turing an amazing sound that has facilitated
openings for the Glory of God to be mani-
fested in the lives of His people. With 20 years
of Senior Pastoral Leadership, we honor an-
other anniversary of service and the faithful fu-
ture he is sure to bring our community.

HONORING THE WORK OF ARMAND
DERFNER
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 22, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask the House of Representatives to join
me in recognizing the important contributions
of Armand Derfner to the advancement of civil
rights in the United States.
In 1940, on his second birthday, Armand
Derfner and his Jewish parents fled Nazi Ger-
many to America. Derfner graduated from
Princeton University in 1960. He would go on
to receive Princeton’s Koren Prize in History
and a Woodrow Wilson Foundation Fellowship
directly following his graduation. Derfner at-
tended Yale Law School, where he was the
Note & Comment Editor of the Yale Law Jour-
nal and was Order of the Coif.
Following his graduation from Yale Law
School, Derfner clerked for Chief Judge David
L. Bazelon on the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit. Derfner then
became an associate at Covington & Burling.
After practicing law in the District of Colum-
bia, Derfner moved to Jim Crow Mississippi to
practice as a civil rights lawyer. His passion
for social and political justice led to his being
stalked. His dog was even poisoned, and he
and his wife were shot at multiple times.
While in Mississippi, Derfner acted as a civil
rights attorney for the Mississippi Freedom
Democratic Party. In 1968, Derfner rep-
resented voters in Greenwood, Mississippi, on
the first day that the Voting Rights Act became
effective. At just 29 years old, Derfner argued
and won his first Supreme Court case. From
the 1960s through the 1990s, Derfner played
a vital role in civil rights cases, taking many of
them to the Supreme Court. Derfner argued
before the Supreme Court five times and won
every case. These Supreme Court arguments
helped shape the Voting Rights Act and its
amendments.
Derfner also contributed to the passage of
the Civil Rights Attorneys Fees Awards Act in
1976 and the Equal Access to Justice Act of
1980. It was Derfner’s work that led to the
freeing of the Charleston Five, a protest group
that was falsely accused of inciting violence.
In the 1980s, while still attached to civil rights
work in Mississippi, Derfner worked closely on
civil rights issues with Massachusetts Senator
Edward Kennedy and simultaneously taught at
American University.
In 2002, Derfner was awarded the Trial
Lawyer of the Year Award by the Trial Law-
yers for Public Justice. In 2009, the American
Bar Association named Derfner’s firm, Derfner
& Altman, Public Interest Lawyers of the Year.
He is an honorary lifetime trustee on the
Board of Trustees for the Lawyers’ Committee
for Civil Rights Under Law. Derfner has just
been named the recipient of the 2019 Commit-
ment to Justice Award from the Center for
Heirs’ Property Preservation.
I ask the House of Representatives to join
me in recognizing Armand Derfner for his
dedication to civil rights and for his significant
contributions to recognizing equal justice
under the law.

HONORING MR. BRIAN HURLEY
FOR BEING SELECTED AS A FI-
NALIST FOR THE GOLDEN APPLE
AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE IN
TEACHING
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 22, 2019
Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to congratulate Mr. Brian Hurley of Reavis
High School for being selected as a finalist for
the Golden Apple Award for Excellence in
Teaching. Through his devotion to his stu-
dents, Mr. Hurley prepares and empowers
them for a better future—a mission deserving
of this prestigious recognition.
The Golden Apple Award for Excellence in
Teaching was created in 1985 by Martin and
Patricia Koldyke. The Koldykes felt that teach-
ers were not receiving adequate recognition
for the work they do in their classrooms and
their communities. This year, 32 finalists from
across the State of Illinois were selected from
a record-setting number of over 550 high
school teacher nominations across 71 coun-
ties. The Golden Apple Foundation’s mission
is to develop and support aspiring teachers to
be successful in schools-of-need in Illinois.
Mr. Hurley works hard to interact with stu-
dents in and out of the classroom. As a teach-
er of science, he strives to engage with his
students through creative research prompts,
out-of-the-box thinking, and projects the stu-
dents find engaging. He states that his strat-
egy is based on constructivist theory, a con-
cept where students build their own interpreta-
tion of the world through individualized learn-
ing experiences and hands on work. To do so,
he employs his own diverse professional back-
ground to teach physics, drawing from his nu-
merous real-life scenarios to explain the com-
plex topics.
As a finalist, Mr. Hurley is being recognized
for his energy, enthusiasm, and mastery of the
classroom. Madam Speaker, I ask my col-
leagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Brian
Hurley. He is well deserving of this praise and
I am proud to represent such a talented edu-
cator.

REMEMBERING REV. MARY
CLIMONS LACEY
HON. BRADLEY SCOTT SCHNEIDER
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 22, 2019
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the remarkable life of Rev.
Mary Climons Lacey, a pillar of our community
who passed away this month at the age of 80.
Rev. Lacey made an indelible mark on our
communities by tirelessly serving those at the
margins. Across Lake County, children in
need, the homeless, and inmates and their
families directly benefited from her generosity
and boundless energy.
Mary broke multiple barriers throughout her
life. She was born to humble beginnings, as
one of ten children in rural Mississippi. At age
21 she moved to Florida to further her edu-
cation, where she met her late husband Wil-
liam, and eventually settled in his hometown
of Waukegan. She found work as a contractor
at Naval Station Great Lakes as well as
handmaking elegant hats.
Never one to rest, she continued to study
and was ordained a pastor, became a foster
parent, and earned a certificate in social work.
In Waukegan, her memory lives on as the
namesake of Mary’s Mission, a homeless
shelter she founded that has provided shelter
to hundreds of individuals in times of need,
and has helped them develop the job training
and skills they need to get back on their feet
and live independently.
Mary was also a fierce advocate for chil-
dren, bringing joy to young residents during
the holidays. Mary teamed up with the Wau-
kegan police department to start a toy give-
away program for children who might not re-
ceive a gift during the holidays. I had the privi-
lege to join several of her annual Christmas
parades from Mary’s Mission to the Lake
County jail, where she handed out turkeys and
toys.
Her perseverance in helping vulnerable peo-
ple, touched and improved the lives of count-
less Illinoisans. She truly lived her faith every
day, and she will be sorely missed. I extend
my heartfelt condolences to her many family
and friends who are mourning her passing.

CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.J.
RES. 31, FURTHER CONTINUING
APPROPRIATIONS FOR DEPART-
MENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY,
2019
SPEECH OF
HON. SUZANNE BONAMICI
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, February 14, 2019
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to
express my support for this government
spending bill negotiated by the bipartisan Con-
ference Committee. Although the bill is not
what I would have drafted, and I recognize
that we still have much work to do in the area
of humane immigration reform, we simply can-
not have another painful, costly, and unneces-
sary shutdown. The members of our Coast
Guard, TSA, and other federal agencies are
still recovering from the most recent shutdown.
They deserve certainty, and they need to
know that they can continue working and that
they will be paid on time. The President must
also act responsibly and fulfill his duty to fed-
eral workers and those who rely on govern-
ment services by signing this legislation.
This bill includes many victories I am proud
to support; it delivers a pay raise to federal
workers to keep pace with the cost of living,
invests in the Census to provide a fair and ac-
curate count for underrepresented commu-
nities, and dedicates $17 billion in new infra-
structure funding to improve our roads,
bridges, and mass transit. The legislation in-
creases investments in small business initia-
tives for minority and women-owned busi-
nesses, which will create jobs. The bill also re-
jects the Trump Administration’s attacks on
the environment by denying deep cuts to pro-
grams that protect clean water, clean air, and
public lands.
As with any compromise, I have serious res-
ervations about some of the provisions in this
bill—particularly regarding immigration en-
forcement. I appreciate that our conferees
were able to prevent the wasteful inclusion of
any increased funding for an ineffective border
wall and include humanitarian assistance fund-
ing for migrants, but the House must continue
to push for smarter, more compassionate use
of resources for border security and immigra-
tion enforcement. I am concerned that this bill
gives the Department of Homeland Security
too much leeway to continue the unchecked
targeting and detention of immigrants who
pose no threat to public safety, rather than fo-
cusing enforcement efforts on high-priority
criminals.
I continue to support having the appropriate
personnel, equipment, facilities, and resources
to address crime and trafficking on our bor-
ders, but immigration enforcement should not
be militarized and operate with impunity. We
can treat individuals in a humane and just
manner and still prevent crime, reduce traf-
ficking, and keep our country safe. People
fleeing violence in their home countries and
seeking asylum in the United States need to
be protected, not threatened with more perse-
cution. We must enact commonsense changes
to improve accountability and protect the fun-
damental rights of immigrants—especially
those legally seeking asylum. I will keep push-
ing for rigorous oversight of ICE and reforms
to our immigration enforcement system.
This legislation is the product of good-faith
negotiations between bipartisan leaders in the
House and Senate. I am hopeful that this re-
sult demonstrates the futility of chaotic
brinksmanship, and I hope that we can learn
from this experience to resolve differences
through dialogue and trust in the legislative
process.

HONORING MS. ANNE M. BRENNAN
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR.
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 22, 2019
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
ask the House of Representatives to join me
in recognizing Ms. Anne. M. Brennan for her
32 years of outstanding Federal service as a
civilian attorney for the Department of the
Navy (DON) Office of the General Counsel
(OGC).
Since she began her distinguished career
with DON OGC in 1986, Ms. Brennan has
held several attorney positions. Notably, she
became a member of the Senior Executive
Service in April 2004. In January 2008, she
was selected to serve as the Deputy General
Counsel, and in August 2009, she was des-
ignated Principal Deputy General Counsel.
During her tenure in these latter positions as
the DON’s most senior career attorney, she
twice served as the Acting General Counsel of
the Navy—a presidentially appointed, Senate-
confirmed position—from May 2009 to March
2010, and from January 2017 to February
2019.
From advising the Secretary of the Navy in
the wake of the Washington Navy Yard shoot-
ings to serving as a lynchpin of efforts be-
tween senior DON leadership, numerous DON
stakeholders, the Department of Justice, and a
United States Attorney’s Office on an ex-
tremely high-profile criminal fraud case, Ms.
Brennan has distinguished herself as an ex-
traordinary attorney, who has consistently ex-
ceeded expectations by working tirelessly to
provide proactive, accurate, and innovative
legal advice on legally complex, politically sen-
sitive issues implicating business, procure-
ment, fiscal, labor, ethics, environmental, and
intelligence law. Additionally, she has dem-
onstrated an unmatched record of leadership
while overseeing and coordinating the provi-
sion of legal advice by more than 750 civilian
and military attorneys within DON OGC, en-
suring the successful execution of the Navy
and Marine Corps missions worldwide.
Throughout her illustrious career, Ms. Bren-
nan has received various awards for her out-
standing contributions to the DON, the Depart-
ment of Defense (DoD), and the Nation.
These include the DON Meritorious, Superior,
and Distinguished Civilian Service Awards, the
DoD Distinguished Civilian Service Award, the
Presidential Rank Awards of Meritorious and
Distinguished Executive, the William R.
Molzahn Leadership Award, and other per-
formance-related accolades.
Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I ask
the House of Representatives to join me in
recognizing Ms. Anne M. Brennan as she re-
tires from Federal service.

INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO RE-
QUIRE THE LIBRARY OF CON-
GRESS TO INSTALL THE D.C.
SEAL IN THE MAIN READING
ROOM OF THE THOMAS JEFFER-
SON BUILDING
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 22, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce a bill to require the Library of Con-
gress to install the District of Columbia seal in
the Main Reading Room of the Thomas Jeffer-
son Building of the Library of Congress. The
Library is one of the few buildings in the Dis-
trict that remains open to the public on most
holidays. It provides not only D.C. residents
but visitors and researchers from across the
nation with access to incomparable resources.
The bill requires the Library to depict the Dis-
trict’s seal on the stained-glass windows in the
Main Reading Room, where the seals of all

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E195
February 22, 2019
the states and territories that existed when the
building was constructed, except for the Dis-
trict, are depicted. D.C.’s seal was readily
available at that time and should have been
included. The seals of Hawaii and Alaska are
not included in the display because they were
not states or territories when the building was
constructed. The fact that these two states
were not part of the Union at the time of the
creation of the stained-glass windows argues
for the inclusion of the District, which, after all,
was in fact the nation’s capital at the time. We
are asking that the omission of D.C. be cor-
rected immediately. This omission was
brought to my attention by a District resident,
Luis Landau, a former docent at the Library.
The residents of the District have always
had all the obligations of American citizenship,
including paying federal taxes and serving in
all the nation’s wars, including the War of
1812, during which the Capitol building, which
then housed the Library of Congress, was
burned, prompting construction of the current
Library building with the state and territory
seals. It is, therefore, without question that the
District and its residents should receive equal
treatment among the stained-glass windows
that portray the history of the United States.
D.C. residents deserve to have their history
and American citizenship recognized.
There is existing evidence that the seal of
the District should have been depicted. The
Members of Congress room in the Jefferson
Building, which is not open to the public, has
a painted depiction of the D.C. seal, along
with state seals, on its ceiling. This precedent
reinforces our request to be represented
among the stained-glass windows in the Main
Reading Room, which is open to the public.
There is no reason why the D.C. seal cannot
be added with the planned restoration of the
stained-glass. The right time to add the seal of
the District would be during the planned res-
toration.
Congress already includes the District, or
has corrected the omission of the District,
when honoring the states. For example, the
World War II Memorial includes a column rep-
resenting the District, and D.C.’s Frederick
Douglass statue now sits in the Capitol along-
side statues from the 50 states. The National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2013 requires the armed services to display
the District flag whenever the flags of the
states are displayed. Legislation was also en-
acted to give D.C. a coin after it was omitted
from legislation creating coins for the 50
states. We also successfully worked with the
U.S. Postal Service to create a D.C. stamp,
like the stamps for the 50 states, and worked
with the National Park Service to add the D.C.
flag alongside the state flags across from
Union Station. It is long overdue to display the
D.C. seal, along with the seals of the states,
in the Main Reading Room of the Library of
Congress.
I urge support of this legislation.
CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE BETA RHO
CHAPTER OF TRI KAPPA INCOR-
PORATED
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 22, 2019
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is my
distinguished pleasure to recognize the Beta
Rho Chapter of Tri Kappa Incorporated, as the
organization celebrates its 100th anniversary.
A century of outstanding dedication to the
community through philanthropic service and
support is certainly an amazing accomplish-
ment. In honor of this momentous milestone,
a 100th anniversary banquet will take place on
Sunday, February 24, 2019, at Innsbrook
Country Club in Merrillville, Indiana.
Tri Kappa Incorporated was organized on
February 22, 1901, in Indianapolis. Through-
out the state of Indiana, there are 146 chap-
ters, 110 associate chapters, and approxi-
mately 9,000 members. The organization’s
mission is to promote charity, culture, and
education by supporting philanthropic estab-
lishments and projects within its local commu-
nities. Each year, the members of Tri Kappa
give over 300,000 hours of service to their
mission and raise over $1.5 million for college
students, charities, and cultural organizations.
The Beta Rho Chapter of Tri Kappa was es-
tablished in Gary, Indiana, on February 21,
1919. The organization is truly thankful and in-
debted to the strong women who founded the
Beta Rho Chapter. The charter officers are
Rose Dorman, president, Anita Bailey, vice
president, Minnie Milteer, recording secretary,
Esther McCauley, corresponding secretary,
and Anne Gibson, treasurer. Additional found-
ing members include Ione Hodge, Geraldine
Newman, Marcelle Miller, May Hake, Gene-
vieve Michally, Marcia Lamb, Maude Norris,
Marjory Hutton, and Edna Emley. These
women laid the foundation for the successful
organization it is today.
Each year, the members and leaders of the
Gary Chapter give passionately and selflessly
of their time, energy, and support to numerous
deserving organizations throughout the region,
including the Northwest Indiana Symphony,
Sojourner Truth House, Meals on Wheels,
Food Bank of Northwest Indiana, South Shore
Arts Northwest Indiana, and Lakeshore Public
Television, to name a few. In addition, aca-
demic scholarships are given to commendable
students each year. For their significant con-
tributions to the community of Northwest Indi-
ana and beyond, the members and leaders of
the Beta Rho Chapter of Tri Kappa Incor-
porated are truly worthy of the highest praise.
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my
other distinguished colleagues join me in con-
gratulating the Beta Rho Chapter of Tri Kappa
Incorporated as the organization celebrates its
100th anniversary. The members of this out-
standing organization have dedicated them-
selves to serving others and continue to im-
prove the quality of life for the people of
Northwest Indiana; they serve as an inspira-
tion to us all.

Mr. Vazzana teaches English and endeav-
ors to help students gain new perspectives.
He has worked hard to connect with students
beyond the traditional academic classroom.
These efforts have ranged from inviting former
graduates to speak about their struggles in
high school to acting as the school’s Drama
Director, bringing important topics to the fore-
front of developing adolescent minds.
As a finalist, Mr. Vazzana is being recog-

of the classroom. Madam Speaker, I ask my
colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr.
Vazzana. He is well deserving of this praise
and I am proud to represent such a talented

served with distinction over the course of his
twenty-two-year career in law enforcement
and was the leader the public needed during
one of our region’s most destructive wildfires
to date.
Born in Concord, California, Rob Giordano
was working as a mechanic when he felt a
calling to join law enforcement. He began his
law enforcement career in 1989, serving as a
police officer for the Pittsburg Police Depart-
ment in Contra Costa County. Seven years
later, Officer Giordano moved to Sonoma
County to serve as a Deputy for the Sonoma
County Sheriff’s office. He was promoted to
Sergeant in 2003, where he supervised the
main office patrol, the Domestic Violence and
Sexual Assault Unit, and the Violent Crimes
Unit. Sergeant Giordano continued to prove
himself as a leader and was promoted to Lieu-
tenant only three years later, where he man-
aged the Investigations Bureau and Internal
Affairs Bureau, among others. Lieutenant Gior-
dano was promoted again in 2012, this time to
Captain of the Field Services Section. In 2014,
after eighteen years with the department, Cap-
tain Giordano was promoted to Assistant
Sheriff.
By August of 2017, Assistant Sheriff Gior-
dano was promoted to Interim Sheriff when
the seated sheriff stepped down for health
reasons. His status as Sheriff was made offi-
cial by the Board of Supervisors shortly there-
after, and he was appointed to serve the re-
mainder of the previous Sheriff’s term. Sheriff
Giordano never sought the role, and in fact,
he pledged to not seek election to the position
following to the term’s conclusion. He wanted
to ensure continuity for the department and
the public prior to the next election. However,
Sheriff Giordano probably didn’t expect was
that within two months, his leadership signifi-
cantly changed the way the community en-
gages with the Sheriff’s Office.
On October 8, 2017, one of the most de-
structive fires in California history caused in
Sonoma County. Upon receiving the news,
Sheriff Giordano and his team sprung into ac-
tion, not only saving lives but actively commu-
nicating with a frightened public. To many
watching the events unfold from afar, Sheriff
Giordano became the face of the community,
holding press conferences daily while the fires
were still being contained. His actions as a
communicator, along with the office’s in-
creased use of social media not only helped
calm a community in shock but also saved
lives by sharing critical information in a timely
manner. By the time the fires were contained,
many called for Sheriff Giordano to forgo his
initial pledge and seek election to continue on
as the county’s Sheriff. Sheriff Giordano re-
mained committed to his pledge and instead
focused on getting the Sheriff’s Office ready
for the transition to new leadership while con-
tinuing to build good will between the depart-
ment and the public.
Madam Speaker, Sheriff Giordano’s law en-
forcement career is a sterling example of lead-
ership that prioritizes service to the public
above personal gain. Over the course of his
time with the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office,
he has not only improved the performance of
the divisions and units he has overseen, but
has also greatly improved the way the com-
munity engages with law enforcement. There-
fore, please join me in honoring Sheriff Gior-
dano on the occasion of his retirement and
wishing him success on his future endeavors.

TRIBUTE TO ROY DOUGLAS AND
SHIRLEY ANN MALONSON OF
HOUSTON, TEXAS ENTRE-
PRENEURS, PHILANTHROPISTS,
COMMUNITY LEADERS WHOSE
LIFETIME OF CIVIC ENGAGE-
MENT HAS ENRICHED OUR NA-
TION
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 22, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise
to pay tribute to Roy Douglas and Shirley Ann
Malonson, two great Americans in the City of
Houston and Harris County, Texas, whose en-
trepreneurial talents and zeal over the past
three decades has raised the consciousness
of Houston’s African American community to
the life-changing potential of the free enter-
prise system and created thousands of jobs in
the Acres Home Community located in my
congressional district and Houston Metroplex.
Acres Homes, once considered the South’s
largest unincorporated black community, is
south of Aldine and ten miles northwest of
downtown Houston in Harris County. It devel-
oped around the time of World War I, when
landholders began selling off home sites in
plots big enough to allow small gardens and
maintain chickens or farm animals. The town
derived its name from the fact that land was
sold by the acre and not by the lot. The first
settlers came from rural areas, attracted by
the community’s inexpensive land, low taxes,
and the absence of city building standards.
Residents dug wells and built sanitary facili-
ties, but conditions in the settlement subse-
quently declined. When the city of Houston
approved a plan to annex the area and install
water and sewer lines, Acres Homes was a
121⁄2-square-mile, heavily wooded, and dis-
persed slum settlement lacking transportation
and educational facilities. Although 90 percent
of the residents were homeowners, the major-
ity of the housing stock was substandard.
In 1950, Roy Malonson was afflicted with
polio that left him with physical limitations, but
it had no effect on his vision and drive. His
late father, John Curley Malonson, Sr., chal-
lenged him by saying, ‘‘something is wrong
with your leg, but there is nothing wrong with
your mind, so work with what you have.’’ At
age 7, Roy Malonson was shining shoes in his
father’s barber shop and by age 13 had
opened a woodworking shop. The wood-
working company grew to become Roy’s Cus-
tom Cabinets which later became the
Malonson Construction Company which be-
came Malonson Custom Homes and is now
the Malonson Company, Inc., one of the larg-
est and best African American custom home-
builders in Houston.
In the early 1990s, Roy Malonson devel-
oped new health problems, struck by what has
come to be called the ‘‘Post-Polio Syndrome.’’
Once again using mind over physical limita-
tion, Roy Malonson overcame and adapted.
He retired from his 27-year old building busi-
ness, reduced his workday, and devoted more
time to community service and businesses he
could manage. This enabled him to devote
and donate more time and financial support to
the many educational and community organi-
zations he helped establish, including the
Acres Home War on Drugs, the first commu-
nity war on drugs in the nation.
Roy and Shirley Malonson also founded the
Acres Home Citizen Chamber of Commerce,
focusing on business, community, and edu-
cation; the Acres Home Community Develop-
ment Corp, focusing on housing; the Acres
Home Coalition Administrative School, the first
charter school in Texas; and in 1994 the
Acres Home Center for Business & Economic
Development, a non-profit 501(c)(3) which has
become recognized as a cornerstone pro-
viding leadership, as well as personal and pro-
fessional development opportunities to small
businesses and entrepreneurs in the commu-
nity.
The Malonsons were the driving force be-
hind Aldine Independent School District Mon-
tessori-Magnet Programs, the Lone Star Com-
munity College System Victory Center, the
Acres Home Multiservice Center, and the
Acres Home Police Station.
Roy and Shirley Malonson invested in and
uplifted the Acres Home Community by estab-
lishing in 1992 Shirley Ann’s Black Art &
Kollectibles Showroom, the largest Black Art &
Kollectibles Showroom in Texas and one of
the largest in the nation. In 1996 they estab-
lished African American News & Issues, the
largest African American newspaper in Texas
and one of the largest in the nation. And in
1998, with one mission in mind, to offer and
deliver pizza in the African American commu-
nity, they purchased two Domino’s Pizza
stores, the South Victory and Ella locations,
and had controlling interest in a total of ten lo-
cations throughout Houston.
Roy and Shirley Ann Malonson continued
their entrepreneurial zeal and commitment to
the Acres Home community by establishing in

Flower Shop in 2013; the RS Deer & Cattle
Ranch in Waller County; and Shirley Ann’s
Black Kollectibles & Flowers in 2014. Shirley
Ann Malonson is now President and CEO of
the Malonson Company.
Roy Douglas Malonson and Shirley Ann
Malonson are the proud parents of a daughter,
Melanie Nicole Malonson, and the grand-
parents of Tayler and Caleb.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor two
legendary Texas heroes, my constituents, Roy
Douglas and Shirley Ann Malonson, who have
devoted their lifetimes to creating economic
opportunity and development for their beloved
Acres Homes community. These two great
American trailblazers have made a difference
in the lives of thousands of men, women, chil-
dren and businesses. Their work has brought
our nation closer to fulfilling its founding
ideals. And it is that work that truly makes
America great.
RECOGNZING THE BETTER CHINA-
TOWN USA LUNAR NEW YEAR
PARADE 20TH YEAR ANNIVER-
SARY
HON. NYDIA M. VELÁZQUEZ
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 22, 2019
Ms. VELÁZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the 20th Anniversary of the
Chinatown Lunar New Year Parade in New
York City organized by the Better Chinatown
USA. The Lunar New Year is the most impor-
tant traditional event celebrated for thousands
of years by Asian and Pacific Islanders in New
York and around the world. This is a time to
pay homage to one’s ancestors, enjoy family
reunions, great food and other traditions.
The Better Chinatown USA, a community
volunteer-based organization, is dedicated to
bringing people together and providing serv-
ices that promote the culture, tradition and
contributions of Chinese Americans in New
York. In the aftermath of 9/11, the parade
helped launch the economic rebound of
Chinatown’s small business community. The
event started with just 500 marchers and a
local Chinatown audience but has grown to
encompass more than 20,000 participants, 80
floats, lion and dragon dances, acrobats and
marching bands. Today, the parade draws
more than half a million spectators from the
East Coast and abroad.
Better Chinatown USA has enriched the cul-
tural fabric of my district and New York City.
Festivals like these showcase the strength and
diversity of our immigrant neighborhoods. That
is why I am proud to represent the Manhattan
and Brooklyn Chinatown communities.
Madam Speaker, as we mark the Year of
the Pig, please join me in congratulating the
Better Chinatown USA Lunar New Year Pa-
rade on its 20th year anniversary and for its
public service to the New York community. I
wish them continued success.
