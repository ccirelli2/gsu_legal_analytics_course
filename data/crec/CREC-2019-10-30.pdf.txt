DETERIORATING CONDITIONS AT
THE MEXICAN BORDER
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. VELA) for 5 minutes.
Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, last Friday,
many of us attended the funeral for our
colleague, Elijah Cummings. His story
and the service were inspirational. On
that same day, this article concerning
the deteriorating conditions of the
Mexican border appeared in The Texas
Tribune about the consequences of the
Trump administration’s Migrant Pro-
tection Protocols, or MPP.
The article describes America’s inhu-
manity unfolding in Matamoros, Mex-
ico, a border town in which I, as a
child, spent much of my time and in
which my ancestors are buried. It is a
story about America’s cruelty, for
which the President of the United
States is directly responsible.
As I thought about what I could do
about this situation, I couldn’t help
but ask myself: What would Elijah do?
By creating obstacle after obstacle,
the Trump administration does every-
thing within its power to prevent asy-
lum claimants from having their right-
ful day in court, whether they are enti-
tled to stay or not.
Its latest obstruction is the Migrant
Protection Protocols, which are any-
thing but protection. The MPP forces
asylum claimants to wait in dangerous
Mexican border towns as their claims
are processed, and they have proven to
be nothing more than a weapon used to
destroy America’s longstanding reputa-
tion as the world’s greatest melting
pot. It is a blatant violation of the due
process clause of the U.S. Constitution.
Our Nation’s asylum laws guarantee
the right to live in the United States
while claims are adjudicated. Over 1,500
people now live in squalor in Mata-
moros, Mexico. They have no running
water and a marginal number of toilets
for all of them. They are housed in
tents and forced to bathe naked out in
the Rio Grande River. Their daily sub-
sistence depends on the goodness of the
volunteers from the Rio Grande Valley
and across this Nation who cross into
Mexico every day to provide a simple
meal. The conditions are worse than
those that I have seen in Syrian ref-
ugee camps.
This is not the way America is sup-
posed to work.
The administration claims that by
creating secret, sham, tent courts
along the border that it is processing
asylum claims. This is nothing more
than a glaring effort to obliterate due
process. In these so-called courts con-
stitutional protections vanish, and
civil liberties disappear.
The administration’s policy is se-
verely restricting and imposing bar-
riers on the very fundamental bedrock
of our legal system—the attorney-cli-
ent relationship. Lawyers representing
these asylum claimants are reporting
that the MPP policy is making some-
thing as simple as the opportunity to
meet with their client an impos-
sibility. As of this August, less than 2
percent of those in MPP court even had
lawyers representing them. The forc-
ible removal of claimants to another
country while they await adjudication
is a judicial charade, represents a total
abdication of the principles of fairness
that are the foundations of our justice
system, and makes a mockery of our
Constitution.
Not only are asylum claimants being
denied their rights, the public and the
press are consistently denied access to
these proceedings.
What is there to hide?
The presence of attorneys, advocates,
the press, and the public at these hear-
ings preserves our democracy. The
president of the National Association
of Immigration Judges states as fol-
lows:
Normal immigration court is open to the
public. In civil proceedings in America, one
of the fundamental tenets of our justice sys-
tem is that there has to be accountability to
the public. We do not do stuff behind closed
doors. That is not what America is about.
And yet, with each immigration policy deci-
sion the last 3 years, we are moving closer
and closer to a model that does not resemble
anything in the American judicial system; it
is more like what you might see in China or
Russia.
In our system of criminal jurispru-
dence, a person may be guilty, or they
may not be. But with regard to juris-
prudence, a party may be culpable or
not culpable. But one thing everyone
gets is the opportunity to be heard.

H8600 October 30, 2019
So we have a choice. We can turn a
blind eye to the horror that is this ad-
ministration’s asylum policy, or we
can answer our colleague, Elijah’s, call
to create a system that stands for jus-
tice. Let’s tear down the Migrant Pro-
tection Protocols. Let’s hire the judges
so that we can efficiently and fairly ad-
judicate asylum claims. Let the asy-
lum claimant live in dignity and give
them back their right to be in this
country while they wait for their cases
to be heard.
If asylum is denied after a fair and
just adjudication, let the claimant
leave this country knowing that the
United States system of government
gave them a fair shake.
If, on the other hand, a claimant is
given refugee status, let’s rally behind
them. Let’s show them what America
is really like. Let’s help them achieve
the American dream. I think that is
what Elijah Cummings would do.

CONGRESSIONAL GOLD STAR
FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Oklahoma (Mr. KEVIN HERN) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Mr.
Speaker, Oklahoma native, Christopher
Horton, is one of the namesakes of H.
Res. 107 which passed the House yester-
day.
Army Specialist Christopher Horton
served in the Oklahoma National
Guard’s 1st Battalion, 279th Infantry
Regiment, 45th Infantry Brigade.
Horton grew up in Collinsville, Okla-
homa, and was an exceptional sharp-
shooter. Horton was killed in action on
September 9, 2011, in Afghanistan while
serving in Operation Enduring Free-
dom. His bravery and patriotism are
remembered today as his legacy is en-
shrined 8 years later.
Family members of fallen heroes
hold a special place in our society. The
program started with this legislation
will give family members of our fallen
heroes the unique opportunity to expe-
rience our government up close with a
12-month fellowship in Congress. A
front-row seat to the legislative proc-
ess is a valuable asset to a person de-
ciding where they want to go in their
career. These yearlong fellowships will
allow the family members of our fallen
veterans to become a part of the same
democracy that their loved ones fought
to defend.
Mr. Speaker, I applaud the passage of
this bill and the bipartisan work of my
colleagues, TRENT KELLY and MIKIE
SHERRILL, as well as the tenacious per-
severance of both families of the fallen
soldiers.
f
HONORING VANESSA WHITING OF
CLEVELAND, OHIO
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Ohio (Ms. FUDGE) for 5 minutes.
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, today I
rise to honor Vanessa Whiting of Cleve-
land, Ohio, the recipient of the 2019
Black Professional of the Year Award.
Ms. Whiting will become the 39th in-
dividual to receive this distinguished
award given by the Black Professionals
Association Charitable Foundation at
their annual scholarship and awards
gala. Each year the organization hon-
ors an African American professional
for their career accomplishments, com-
munity engagement, and civic con-
tributions.
Through her considerable achieve-
ments as an attorney, entrepreneur,
and civic leader, Ms. Whiting is most
deserving of this long overdue recogni-
tion. She embodies the mission of the
Black Professionals Association Chari-
table Foundation, which is to create
opportunities for African American
professionals by providing scholarship,
leadership, and career development.
As president of AES Management and
a Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen
franchisee, Ms. Whiting has made hir-
ing people from her community a pri-
ority, creating employment opportuni-
ties where there are few options.
Ms. Whiting has more than 30 years
of experience as an attorney. Through-
out her law career, she focused her
work on revitalizing struggling neigh-
borhoods and helping small and minor-
ity-owned businesses succeed.
Ms. Whiting has committed her time
and talents to address affordable hous-
ing, the need for community centers,
and other projects in our area designed
to uplift the community and empower
its residents.
Ms. Whiting was recently elected
chair of the MetroHealth Hospital
Board of Trustees where she continues
her work promoting diversity and in-
clusion throughout Cuyahoga County’s
public health system. She has served in
many key board positions in the Cleve-
land community, including the NAACP
Cleveland Branch, the Tri-C Founda-
tion, Karamu House, and the Cleveland
Housing Network Board of Trustees.
Mr. Speaker, I commend Ms. Whiting
for her outstanding contributions to
Ohio’s 11th Congressional District. My
sincere congratulations go to Ms. Whit-
ing on this distinguished accomplish-
ment, and I thank her for her leader-
ship and her service.

CLINCH MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Clinch Me-
morial Hospital for being named the
Hometown Health Hospital of the Year
for 2019.
I am proud of the work that Clinch
Memorial Hospital is doing to provide
high-quality care to our rural commu-
nities in the First Congressional Dis-
trict of Georgia. With unique chal-
lenges facing rural healthcare systems
across the Nation, Clinch Memorial
Hospital has met these challenges
head-on and is using groundbreaking
programs to better the care for individ-
uals in the surrounding rural commu-
nities.
Over the last 2 years, the hospital’s
CEO, Ms. Angela Ammons, has added
new programs to help people with sub-
stance abuse issues, a swing-bed sys-
tem to more efficiently use their re-
sources, and a new wound care unit.
But most importantly, she has nearly
miraculously turned around the hos-
pital’s financials, maintaining the
community’s access to healthcare and
keeping the local economy churning.
Clinch Memorial Hospital is more
than deserving of the Hospital of the
Year Award.
Congratulations, and keep up the
good work.
NATIONAL PHARMACIST MONTH 2019
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize October as
being National Pharmacist Month 2019.
According to Census data, there are
over 200,000 pharmacists across the
U.S., with another 25,000 pharmacy
aides. Every day these pharmacists are
providing vaccines for a number of ill-
nesses and carefully counseling pa-
tients on prescriptions to help heal
sickness and reduce pain. Through this
work, pharmacists are considered one
of the top three most-trusted profes-
sions in America.
Mr. Speaker, this month, as well as
through the rest of the year, I encour-
age everyone to visit your pharmacist,
ask questions about your prescriptions,
and get to know the people who provide
your medicine and work to keep you
healthy.
As the only pharmacist currently
serving in Congress, I am proud to rec-
ognize the work these individuals are
doing every day to serve their local
communities around the country.
Keep up the good work.
FORTY-DAY PRO LIFE VIGIL
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize all those
participating in the 40 Days for Life
Vigil happening September 25 through
November 3.
For the past 40 days, individuals in
cities across the world have been fast-
ing, praying, campaigning, and holding
a vigil in order to end abortion. In the
First Congressional District of Geor-
gia, Savannahians have been contrib-
uting to the cause through their own
vigil and luncheon. The organization
has helped save 16,000 lives, close 104
abortion centers, and 191 abortion
workers to quit their jobs.
As a medical professional, father, and
grandfather, I believe that every life is
sacred. I cannot thank these individ-
uals enough for their important work.
After the 40 Days for Life Vigil is over,
I hope you will join me in continuing
the fight to save the lives of our chil-
dren.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8601
October 30, 2019
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Ms. Sheila
McNeill for receiving the 2019 Distin-
guished Civilian Award by the Naval
Submarine League.
Ms. McNeill was the first-ever woman
to win this award, and I could not be
more proud of the work she has done in
the First Congressional District of
Georgia over the last 20 years.
Living in Camden County, near the
Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base, she
has advocated for the U.S. submarine
force at both the national and local
levels, often traveling to Washington
and meeting with dozens of Members of
Congress to keep our submarines at
sea, protecting our Nation.
On one specific occasion, Ms. McNeill
was critical in retaining the Nation’s
first four ballistic missile submarines
by converting them into guided-missile
submarines. Her commitment to the
Armed Forces extends deeply into the
surrounding communities, ensuring
that they maintain close-knit relation-
ships through her work as president of
the Camden Partnership.
Mr. Speaker, I thank and congratu-
late Ms. McNeill for her work in the
First Congressional District of Geor-
gia.
f
HONORING CONGRESSMAN JOHN
CONYERS’ LIFE AND LEGACY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. LEE) for 5 minutes.
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to honor the life and legacy
of the late Congressman John Conyers
and to extend my deepest condolences
to his wife, Monica, his family, chil-
dren, former staff, and the people of
Detroit, who he served so well for more
than 50 years.
Congressman Conyers was a tireless
advocate for racial and economic jus-
tice and an ardent defender of civil
rights. We all owe him a debt of grati-
tude for his unwavering commitment
to pushing our Nation to live up to its
ideals of liberty and justice for all.
That is his legacy.
I met Congressman Conyers during
my time as a staffer to our beloved late
Congressman Ron Dellums, who was
also a cofounder of the Congressional
Black Caucus with Congressman Con-
yers. They were very close friends and
worked together on many issues, in-
cluding the establishment of the Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr. Federal holiday. I
always remember staffing the many
meetings with Ron, Congressman Con-
yers, and the legendary Stevie Wonder,
who worked with us as we planned our
outside-inside strategy for the holiday
legislation. And it worked.
John believed in our democracy and
the power of the people. He recognized
that the only way democracy can work
is with the input, vision, and voice of
the people.
Congressman Conyers stood on the
front lines of the fight for so many im-
portant issues during his time in office,
and he was cosponsor of the Voting
Rights Act of 1965. I probably wouldn’t
be standing here as a Member of Con-
gress had it not been for Congressman
Conyers.
As a cofounder of the Congressional
Black Caucus, he focused the Nation’s
attention on racial inequality and in-
justices faced by African Americans
around the country, from inequity in
education, to poverty, to mass incar-
ceration. He stood up for those who
needed his advocacy the most.
Of course, when Rosa Parks fell on
hard times after refusing to give up her
seat on a segregated Montgomery bus,
in what launched the civil rights move-
ment, John hired her to work in his
district office in Detroit, where she
worked until she retired in 1988.
For more than 30 years, he fought for
H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and
Develop Reparation Proposals for Afri-
can-Americans Act, which calls for a
commission to study reparations for
descendants of enslaved people from
Africa.
Congressman Conyers, Chairman
Conyers, he was masterful, drawing a
connection between the historical in-
justices faced by African Americans
and the present-day inequities experi-
enced in our communities.
I am so proud to support H.R. 40
today and to continue his work. In his
honor, I hope that my colleagues sup-
port Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON
LEE’s efforts to take H.R. 40 over the
finish line.
Congressman Conyers was a progres-
sive champion who fought for all of us.
He was an early supporter of single-
payer healthcare. I believe the bill was
H.R. 676, which I was proud to cospon-
sor.
He fought to ensure that every Amer-
ican has access to quality, affordable
healthcare. He fought to protect our
safety net so that folks who needed a
helping hand, no matter their color,
can keep a roof over their heads and
food on the table.
He spoke out vocally against the
Trump administration’s attacks on
civil rights and human rights for peo-
ple of color and the LGBTQ commu-
nity. Indeed, though Congressman Con-
yers represented Detroit, he truly
fought for all Americans and earned his
affectionate name of ‘‘America’s Con-
gressman.’’
Also, John formed the Poor People’s
Caucus in the House, where he encour-
aged Members to speak out for the poor
and low-income folks.
In his memory, let us fight for the
most vulnerable Americans. Like our
friend, Congressman Elijah Cummings,
who we recently lost as well, Congress-
man Conyers’ legacy and impact will
live on, though he is no longer with us.
His legacy should continue to inspire
us to keep up the fight for justice and
equality, which he dedicated his life to.
Mr. Speaker, so today, once again, I
offer my condolences to Monica, to
Congressman Conyers’ family and
loved ones, and join them in cele-
brating his life and legacy. May he rest
in peace, and may he rest in power.

COMMEMORATING OXI DAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Iowa (Mr. KING) for 5 minutes.
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is
my privilege to be recognized to ad-
dress you here on the floor of the
House of Representatives. I rise to
honor, this week, to celebrate what ac-
tually took place on Monday, the 28th
of October, Oxi Day, the 79th anniver-
sary.
I wanted to address this because of
the strong spirit of the Greek people,
who rose up against the Axis Powers 79
years ago this week when a representa-
tive of Hitler’s Axis Powers, who hap-
pened to be the minister from the
Italians, arrived at the residence of the
Greek leader Metaxas and demanded
that they surrender Greece to the
Italians and the Axis forces.
There, Metaxas looked him in the eye
and said, boldly and strongly, ‘‘Oxi,’’
which is Greek for ‘‘no.’’ That is the
most resounding ‘‘no’’ that I know of in
history, Mr. Speaker. That resounding
‘‘no’’ inspired the Greek people.
Within hours, the Italians and the
Axis forces had started their invasion
of Greece, and they were overconfident.
They thought they would waltz in be-
cause they had all kinds of military
firepower, but what they underesti-
mated was the tenacity of the Greek
fighters, their knowledge of the ter-
rain, and defending their own soil.
They were defeated, and the Greeks
chased the Italians back to Italy,
which forced, then, Adolf Hitler to di-
vert five divisions down through
Greece and down through the Balkans
into Greece to put down the—they
called it a revolution or a resurrection.
What it really was, was inspired people
defending their country, the very cra-
dle of democracy. As Hitler diverted
the five divisions down to Greece, he
was already planning the Operation
Barbarossa.
I want the body to know, Mr. Speak-
er, that the original date for the inva-
sion of Russia under Operation Bar-
barossa by Hitler that his Nazi forces
put together was scheduled to be May
12, the following spring. This is late Oc-
tober, the last days of October. So
when he diverted his five divisions
down to suppress what he said was the
resurrection in the Balkans, which was
the Greeks defending the cradle of free-
dom, that delayed his ability to invade
Russia.
This tenacious battle on the part of
the Greeks—now, I should also put it
into context here, that no one expected
such a small nation to derail the
unstoppable Axis forces. They had
watched as the Axis forces had gone
through Czechoslovakia and Poland,
Romania and France, and down
through the Balkans. It looked like
those Axis forces were going to sweep
over the world. It didn’t look like there

was much hope for the United Kingdom
and the British Empire across the
channel.
When you think about the inevitable
clash that was going to take place be-
tween the Nazis and the Russians, that
would have been the clash that would
have determined which power ruled the
world—coupled with Japanese impe-
rialism, America isolated as a lone is-
land, sitting over here on this con-
tinent, in the Western Hemisphere, aw-
fully tough to battle on both sides
when you have the resources of the
globe lined up against you.
The future of America may well have
turned in that battle as well, Mr.
Speaker.
So I rise to honor, support, and, with
awe, celebrate the Greek fighters, who
George Beres writes: ‘‘As Hitler
learned, Greeks can be stubborn
against all odds. ‘Oxi,’ the word ‘no’ in
Greek, may sound like a negative, but
it has become the most positive word
in the language. It suggests the inde-
pendence of a small nation when con-
fronted by selfish demands of much
larger nations.’’
I would point out that if Hitler had
been able to launch Operation Bar-
barossa on May 12—he was delayed 51⁄2
weeks. Those 51⁄2 weeks would have
given him time to take Stalingrad, to
take Moscow, before the bitter Russian
winter. That would have changed the
entire course of the war.
The Greeks did it twice for us, in
Crete and then again on Oxi Day start-
ing those 79 years ago this week. I am
awfully proud of the spirit of the
Greeks.
I would close, Mr. Speaker, with this
quote from Winston Churchill in the
aftermath of the Greek battles against
the Nazis, which says: ‘‘Hence, we will
not say that Greeks fight like heroes,
but that heroes fight like Greeks.’’
Let us honor them. We are a nation
that has descended from the democracy
that was formed in Greece. We modi-
fied it to a constitutional republic and
did a little improvement on it, but we
can use a lot of Greeks in this country.
They understand freedom, and they are
great fighters.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF
GINNY NICARTHY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL) for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor the memory of long-
time Seattle resident Ginny NiCarthy.
Ginny was a wonderful friend, au-
thor, activist, and advocate. She was
humble, brilliant, and deeply compas-
sionate, and she changed the lives of
tens of thousands of people across the
world through her writing and her ac-
tivism.
She passed away at the age of 92 last
month, choosing to die gracefully on
her own terms before dementia could
take over her life and her mind.
Ginny was born in 1927 in San Fran-
cisco. She was the youngest of five. Her
father once served as the mayor of Red-
wood City, California. Her mother
worked as a switchboard operator.
Passionate about social justice as a
young woman, Ginny moved to Seattle
in her 20s and became involved in her
new city’s artistic and political scene.
She first pursued a teaching certificate
in the 1960s, going on to teach middle
school in Seattle’s Central District.
Informed by her experience working
as a caseworker at a mental hospital,
she decided to pursue a master’s degree
in social work at the University of
Washington and became a practicing
therapist.
Born with the last name McCarthy,
she changed her surname to NiCarthy
in the 1970s to use an Irish prefix that
means ‘‘daughter of,’’ rather than
‘‘Mc,’’ which means ‘‘son of.’’ This was
emblematic of her deeply-rooted femi-
nism and her drive to challenge the
status quo in every aspect of her life.
In 1972, Ginny cofounded Seattle
Rape Relief, which at the time was the
only rape crisis center in the country.
The volunteer-run organization man-
aged a 24-hour hotline for sexual as-
sault victims.
A decade later, she published her
groundbreaking book, ‘‘Getting Free: A
Handbook for Women in Abusive Rela-
tionships.’’ Her book, based on the
premise that women’s voices needed to
be heard and believed, became a bible
for domestic violence survivors. Trans-
lated into multiple languages, her book
had and continues to have a global im-
pact.
She went on to publish several more
books on abuse at home and in the
workplace, as well as many articles ad-
dressing issues of disability, race, sexu-
ality, youth, and aging. She volun-
teered on behalf of countless groups ad-
vocating for women’s rights, criminal
justice reform, and antiwar efforts.
We first met when I approached her
to join the board of Chaya, an organi-
zation that supports South Asian sur-
vivors of domestic violence that I, too,
was on the board of. Much later, Ginny
gave me some of her writings that
turned into a book of her travels
around the world for peace and justice.
I was amazed at her curiosity, her
love of life, even with all the traumas
that she, herself, had been through. I
was struck by the way that she lis-
tened to others and absolutely refused
to stop living life to her fullest. She
was fearless in questioning what she
saw as unjust, and her commitment to
racial equity was striking.
She was arrested multiple times for
peaceful, civil disobedience actions,
even at the age of 86, for speaking out
for more fair and just immigration
policies.
Ginny always found meaning in poli-
tics and social justice activism, and
her legacy lives on strong—in her
books, her friendships, the tremendous
work she did her entire life on behalf of
survivors of violence, and her quest for
justice for all.
Ginny saw the intersectionality of
gender, race, and class very clearly.
She was right there on every major
issue that we fought for, whether that
was a $15 minimum wage, rights for im-
migrants, mass incarceration of Black
and Brown people, sexual assault, and
LGBTQ rights. It is fitting that The
New York Times devoted a substantial
part of one of their pages of obituaries
to Ginny and her national impact.
I would like to commemorate Gin-
ny’s lifetime of achievements, her dec-
ades of service to our community, and
her never-ending dedication to the
fight for justice. My heart is with her
loving family and friends.
Mr. Speaker, may Ginny rest in
peace. May Ginny rest in power. She
will long be remembered and missed by
all of us.

Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Alabama (Mr. BYRNE) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, there are
crossroads in the history of every great
nation so historically significant, so
fraught with dramatic consequences,
that those in position to influence that
nation’s direction are compelled to do
all they can to ensure it does not fall
to the dustbin of history.

We have arrived at one of those mo-
ments. That is why, last week, my col-
leagues and I demanded this majority
end their secret impeachment pro-
ceedings and bring them into the light
of day.
Impeachment of the President of the
United States is, next to the declara-
tion of war, this body’s most solemn,
important authority. Impeachment be-
gins the process of removing the duly-
elected Executive of the United States,
who was chosen, not by this House, but
by the American people.
In the past, this body has always
treated that authority with the solem-
nity and respect that it demands. Cer-
tainly, during the Clinton and Nixon
impeachments, this House respected
our obligation. In this House, under
this majority, no longer.
In the secretive, closed proceedings
in the basement of the Capitol, the ma-
jority party has monopolized all power,
withheld pertinent facts, denied the ac-
cused the right to participate, and of-
fered the minority party little more
than token rights, all outside the pub-
lic eye. The American people, and even
most elected Members of Congress, like
myself, have been able to glean only
whatever lies, leaks, and misinforma-
tion the majority disseminates.
During Watergate, this House specifi-
cally wrote in our rules that we cannot
shut out the public, absent extraor-
dinary circumstances, and for over 40
years our rules prohibited the exclu-
sion of Members from attending hear-
ings on investigations. Yet, this major-
ity has put an end to those practices,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8603
October 30, 2019
using secret depositions to get around
the sunshine rules of this House. Ev-
erything is carefully, reprehensibly de-
signed to obscure reality.
This is a watershed moment of monu-
mental, historic significance. For the
sake of our constitutional Republic, we
must start over and do it the right
way.
Unfortunately, today the Rules Com-
mittee will meet to mark up a resolu-
tion that does absolutely nothing to
change our dark course.
Don’t listen to Democrat talking
points. This resolution is political
cover disguised as good will. This is not
a vote to authorize impeachment but a
vote to validate and continue the com-
mittee’s disgraceful, improperly-con-
ducted proceedings.
This resolution permits the majority
to continue holding proceedings in se-
cret whenever the majority arbitrarily
decides to do so; and, unlike previous
impeachment proceedings, this major-
ity’s empty assurance to offer the mi-
nority the right to issue subpoenas is a
sham. In fact, the minority is only au-
thorized to issue subpoenas if ADAM
SCHIFF and the Democrats on his com-
mittee agree with them, the exact
same situation the minority currently
faces in all but name.
It gives the President no right of due
process and, instead, instructs the
chair of the Rules Committee to deter-
mine, down the road, what the proce-
dures will be for participation of the
President of the United States and his
counsel.
In the resolution presented by the
majority, the President is given no
right to see evidence, present evidence,
call witnesses, have counsel present at
all hearings and depositions, cross-ex-
amine witnesses, make objections re-
lating to the examination of witnesses
or the admissibility of testimony and
evidence, or respond to evidence and
testimony.
How can President Trump defend
himself if he cannot see the evidence
against him? Just as importantly, how
can the American people make an in-
formed judgment?
Under this resolution, the House
would deputize ADAM SCHIFF and JERRY
NADLER, handpicked by Speaker
PELOSI, to be prosecutor, judge, and
jury. The majority chooses what is
seen and unseen by the American peo-
ple.
This is a Star Chamber proceeding
reminiscent of some of the most egre-
gious practices of tin-pot dictators.
Political coups are often shrouded in
patriotic overtones. Look past the
talking points and empty promises
from Democrats. We must expose what
this resolution really does and the ca-
lamitous consequences for due process
and separation of powers it will un-
leash.
Silence in this matter is complicity.
We must rally together to fight back
for the sake of the country we hold
dear. The fate of our Nation depends on
it.
IN CELEBRATION OF FILIPINO
AMERICAN HISTORY MONTH
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Hawaii (Mr. CASE) for 5 minutes.
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to recognize October as Filipino Amer-
ican History Month, a time for all
Americans to remember and celebrate
the incredible past, present, and future
of our fellow citizens whose heritage
lies in the great country of the Phil-
ippines.
I am especially humbled to do so as
the proud Representative of Hawaii’s
First Congressional District, where live
more Filipino Americans—close to
200,000—than in any of our 440 districts
throughout our country. And with Ha-
waii’s Second Congressional District
number two, at about 175,000, our Fil-
Am community in Hawaii stands at
about 375,000, one-quarter of all Hawaii
residents and, by far, the largest per-
centage of any State or territory.
We observe Filipino American His-
tory Month in October because the
first recorded arrival of Filipinos in the
continental United States took place
in 1587, when the Luzones Indios came
ashore from the Manila-built galleon
Nuestra Senora de Esperanza in Morro
Bay, California.
And in 1906, 113 years ago, the first 15
sakada, or contract laborers, arrived in
Honolulu from the Philippines aboard
the SS Doric, marking the first sus-
tained immigration into our country
and the humble beginnings of Fil-Ams
in Hawaii.
Today, our Fil-Am community num-
bers some 4 million throughout our
country, now the second largest of our
Asian American groups.
The story of Filipino Americans is
the story of America. From very hum-
ble beginnings, they have risen through
hard work, sacrifice, commitment to
advancing the next generations, and
mutual support to achieve so much al-
ready.
Hawaii Fil-Ams, in particular, have
been trailblazers:
Peter Aduja became the first Fil-Am
elected to public office in the United
States when he was elected to the Ha-
waii territorial House of Representa-
tives in 1954.
Benjamin Menor became the first
Fil-Am higher court judge as associate
justice of the Hawaii State Supreme
Court.
Ben Cayetano was the first Filipino
American Governor of a U.S. State.
Major General Antonio Taguba was
the second Filipino American pro-
moted to general officer rank in our
Army.
Eddie Flores, Jr., bought the first
L&L Drive-In on Liliha Street in Hono-
lulu in 1976, turning it into a national
franchise.
Carolina Dizon Wong was the first
Filipino American woman to obtain an
M.D. degree.
Ines Cayaban was the first Filipino
American graduate of the school of
public health, nursing, and social work
at the University of Hawaii. She re-
ceived the prestigious Jefferson Award
in 1986 for her service.
Francisco Flores ‘‘Corky’’ Trinidad,
Jr., of Honolulu was an award-winning
editorial cartoonist of the Honolulu
Star-Bulletin, who became the first
Asian editorial cartoonist syndicated
in the United States.
And a loyal veteran of the 1st Fili-
pino Infantry Regiment that fought
alongside our troops in the Philippines
during World War II, Domingo Los
Banos was Hawaii’s first Filipino
American school principal.
I was recently honored to join the
promotion ceremony in Honolulu of
Roy Macareg from colonel to brigadier
general in the Hawaii Army National
Guard, the first Fil-Am to become a
general officer in the history of Ha-
waii’s citizen soldier ranks.
In Hawaii, we also regularly honor
the over 250,000 Filipinos who answered
the call to protect and defend the
United States and the Philippines in
the Pacific theater. In 2016, President
Obama signed into law the Filipino
Veterans of World War II Congressional
Gold Medal Act to bestow Congress’
highest honor upon these worthy vet-
erans.
We also, of course, celebrate, right
here in Congress, our proud Fil-Ams
who serve our country here, my col-
leagues BOBBY SCOTT of Virginia and
TJ COX of California.
Each and all of these lives of achieve-
ment are but a very small sampling of
a broader community that has
achieved so much and contributed so
much to the rich fabric of our country.
And the story of Filipino Americans is
still in its early chapters.
Why are Filipino Americans among
our most successful communities? Gen-
eral Macareg spoke to some of that at
his promotion ceremony when he cred-
ited his own success to the hard work
and sacrifice for him and his five sib-
lings of his father, a laborer, and moth-
er, a teacher, to the values they in-
stilled, and to the constant nurturing
and support of his broader community.
That well describes Filipino Ameri-
cans overall, that and a full and con-
stant embrace of the values, respon-
sibilities, and opportunities of Amer-
ica, while honoring and treasuring the
rich heritage of their ancestral home-
land.
All of this is why I recently joined
Congressman COX in introducing H.
Res. 621, a resolution to express sup-
port for the permanent designation of
October as Filipino American History
Month.
We urge our colleagues’ support to
promote an ongoing appreciation of the
contributions of Filipino Americans to
our country and to the rich diversity of
our Nation.
To Fil-Ams everywhere: ‘‘Thank you
very much and God bless’’—‘‘maraming
salamat po and dios ti agngina’’—and
congratulations. I truly look forward
to partnering with you on your next
proud chapters.

H8604 October 30, 2019
RECOGNIZING PENNSBURY ATH-
LETIC ASSOCIATION 12-AND-
UNDER AND 8-AND-UNDER BASE-
BALL TEAMS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5
minutes.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize the Pennsbury
Athletic Association 12-and-under and
8-and-under baseball teams, who were
both honored for their championship-
winning seasons.
The 8-and-under team had an
undefeated regular season. They went
on to win the district, State, mid-At-
lantic, and world series championships.
The team’s final record was an impres-
sive 38–1, which included going
undefeated during the Cal Ripken
World Series.
The 12-and-under team had a great
season as well, winning the annual
Keystone Cup State tournament. Win-
ning is nothing new for this team. In
the last 4 years, they have won two
State titles and four district titles.
They will be finishing the season with
an amazing trip to Cooperstown for the
national tournament.
Mr. Speaker, the accomplishments of
these teams show the importance
sports can play in our children’s lives.
Team sports teach the importance of
hard work, being part of a team, dedi-
cation, and sportsmanship. All these
skills help mold our children and will
help mold our children into the leaders
of tomorrow.
I commend the accomplishments of
these amazing kids and their coaches.
RECOGNIZING BRISTOL TOWNSHIP POLICE
OFFICERS CJ WINIK AND KURT LEACOCK
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize two police offi-
cers from Bristol Township.
Officers CJ Winik and Kurt Leacock
were promoted to the rank of sergeant
in front of family, friends, and col-
leagues. Both officers serve on the
Bucks County Homicide by Vehicle
Task Force.
Sergeant Winik has been a part of
the Bristol police force since 2006. He
has worked as a field training officer,
accident reconstructionist, firearms in-
structor, community response unit of-
ficer, and on the SWAT team. He will
serve in the administrative division,
supervising professional standards, ac-
creditation, and training management.
Sergeant Leacock has been part of
the department since 2007. He has
served as a field training officer, drug
recognition expert, and on the crisis
intervention team. He will share duties
with shift commander Sergeant Tom
Gaffney on patrol.
Mr. Speaker, the role both of these
officers play in keeping our community
safe is admirable, and I want to wish
the best to both of these men in their
new positions and thank them for all
their service to our community.
IN SUPPORT OF NATIONAL VETERANS SMALL
BUSINESS WEEK
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to support National Vet-
erans Small Business Week, which will
take place from November 4 through
November 8.
Our veterans are some of the most
highly skilled workers in our Nation.
They are the product of rigorous train-
ing, an ironclad commitment to team-
work, and the remarkable ability to
succeed where others might fail.
Veterans not only fight for and pro-
tect this country but are trained with
the skills and leadership qualities that
are needed to own and operate success-
ful businesses.
Our veteran small business owners
are job creators, entrepreneurs, and he-
roes, and I am proud to recognize the
important role that veteran-owned
small businesses play in our commu-
nity, and we thank all of them, from a
grateful Congress, for their service.
f
THE SUBSTANCE UNDERLYING
THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
New York (Mr. JEFFRIES) for 5 minutes.
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, earlier
today, President Trump urged his Re-
publican defenders in this House to
focus on substance. That is exactly
what House Democrats have been doing
from the very beginning of this im-
peachment inquiry.
We will continue to proceed in a seri-
ous, solemn, and somber fashion. That
is what the Constitution requires at
this moment.
House Democrats will continue to
follow the facts, apply the law, be guid-
ed by the Constitution, and present the
truth to the American people.
President Trump said focus on sub-
stance.
What is the substance underlying
this impeachment inquiry?
Well, Congress, on a bipartisan basis,
allocated $391 million in military and
economic aid to Ukraine at a time
when Ukraine is under attack by Rus-
sian-backed separatists.
Ukraine is in a vulnerable state.
Ukraine is a friend; Russia is a foe.
Ukraine is a democracy; Russia is a
dictatorship.
The United States is probably the
only thing standing between Vladimir
Putin and Ukraine being completely
overrun as part of Putin’s fantasy to
reconstruct what he views as the glory
days of the Soviet Union.
We allocated that money because it
is in the national security interest of
the United States of America.
What happened to it?
In February, the Trump administra-
tion wrote to Congress and said the aid
is on the way. But it never showed up.
b 1045
And then in May, Trump’s Depart-
ment of Defense wrote to Congress
again and said the aid is on the way
and all necessary preconditions to re-
lease the aid have been met, including
the implementation of anticorruption
protocols. That was a letter written by
the Trump Department of Defense in
May. That is the substance.
Twice MITCH MCCONNELL during this
summer called up the Trump adminis-
tration and said, ‘‘Where’s the aid?’’
Mr. MCCONNELL couldn’t get a good an-
swer.
And then on July 18, we know that
the Office of Management and Budget
in the White House held a meeting
where it was made clear that the rea-
son the aid had been held up is because
of a directive from the President of the
United States.
A week later, on July 25, the Presi-
dent made a phone call to the Ukrain-
ian leader and pressured a foreign gov-
ernment to target an American citizen
for political gain and solicit foreign in-
terference in the 2020 election.
That undermines our national secu-
rity. The American people have a right
to ask: Is that an abuse of power?
That is what the impeachment in-
quiry is all about, Mr. President. That
is the substance. It doesn’t look good.
No one is above the law.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
ADDRESSING THE BROKEN
REFUGEE SYSTEM
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Ohio (Mr. STIVERS) for 5 minutes.
Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to address our broken refugee
system and its very real effect on fami-
lies in my hometown of Columbus,
Ohio.
Our Nation has always been a beacon
of hope and light for those who face vi-
olence, persecution, and oppression,
but in recent years we have not been
living up to that standard. And our
failure has a severe impact on good,
hardworking people that would make
our Nation stronger.
Take, for example, Bashiya, who cur-
rently lives in Columbus, Ohio.
Bashiya, in many ways, embodies what
we know to be American. She is the
wife of a man who served our military.
She loves her family. She is hard-
working. And she has built a life for
herself and her family in Ohio. In many
ways her story is much like ours.
Unfortunately, one piece of her story
is missing. Her husband, Hamad, lives
on the other side of the world in Aus-
tralia. Hamad served alongside the U.S.
Army as an interpreter in Iraq, and the
repayment for his bravery was repeated
and sustained threats against him,
Bashiya, and their two young children.
The danger they faced ultimately drove
the young family apart.
The refugee process, and particularly
the Special Immigrant Visa process
that was designed to protect people
like Hamad failed him. The application
and vetting process was dragging on
with no end in sight, and the continued
threats convinced Hamad that he need-
ed to flee for his life, so he fled to Aus-
tralia. That was in 2012.

October 30, 2019
Bashiya and the two children contin-
ued to wait for approval of the Special
Immigrant Visa program, and finally,
in 2016, 7 years after they applied, they
got the news they were waiting for.
They were approved. Now, it has been 7
years since Bashiya has seen her hus-
band and since he has seen his children.
The system has torn the family apart.
Bashiya’s story is not uncommon.
There are others.
Jackie, a dedicated and compas-
sionate social worker from Uganda, is
the mother of two sons. Jackie has not
seen her oldest son, Arinda, since 2014,
when she fled Nairobi, Kenya and came
to the United States. Arinda will turn
8 years old on November 13. And on No-
vember 21, his case to join his mother
will have been pending for 2 years. For
2 years this family has been in bureau-
cratic limbo, and it has taken its toll.
Jackie is seriously considering having
her son adopted by a family in Canada
so she at least will be separated by less
time and geography.
Our system is broken. We are forcing
refugees to other countries like Aus-
tralia and Canada, and we are not liv-
ing up to the standards of the shining
beacon for people facing persecution
and violence. We are a Nation of immi-
grants. We are a Nation of opportunity,
and we need to act like it. We will con-
tinue to encourage the administration
to increase the refugee caps to make
the vetting process under the State De-
partment more efficient and to ensure
resources are available to give refugees
the certainty that they need.
I hope that my colleagues will join
me and make a difference for people
like Bashiya and Jackie and make a
difference for our communities, be-
cause we are all stronger when we em-
brace our history as the world’s melt-
ing pot.
f
RECOGNIZING KERENSA WING AS
THE NATIONAL PRINCIPAL OF
THE YEAR
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. WOODALL) for 5 minutes.
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate you making some time in the day
today. It is not very often that one of
us gets named the very best in our
field. Such a recognition is very power-
ful. And today, Mr. Speaker, you can’t
see it from where you are standing, but
I have a list of the three finalists in the
National Association of Secondary
School Principals Principal of the Year
program.
Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate
each and every one of them. They are:
Joey Jones from Robert Frost Middle
School right around the corner in
Rockville, Maryland; Lindsa McIntyre
from Jeremiah E. Burke High School in
Dorchester, Massachusetts; and
Kerensa Wing from Collins Hill High
School in Suwanee, Georgia.
Mr. Speaker, we cannot succeed in
our communities without dedicated
public servants like these, and it will
come as no surprise to you, since I am
down here on the floor today congratu-
lating these three finalists, that the
national association named as the
Principal of the Year from my very
own district, from the Gwinnett Coun-
ty school system, Kerensa Wing at Col-
lins Hill High School.
Mr. Speaker, to meet Kerensa Wing,
the first thing you will notice is that
charisma that she has that connects
her with her students and with her par-
ents. That partnership that she devel-
ops with her administrators and with
her teachers, that is the partnership
that we strive for here and the one that
is recognizing Kerensa Wing out of
90,000 principals across the country.
Mr. Speaker, Ms. Wing has spent her
entire career in service to my commu-
nity back home. I only represent two
counties. She lives in one, makes that
her family’s home. She works in the
other, having spent 30 years in the
Gwinnett County school system. These
pictures reflect her work in her last 5
years as principal at Collins Hill High
School. She has also served at Shiloh
High School as a teacher. She helped to
open our brand-new Lanier High
School, and then returned to Collins
Hill.
Mr. Speaker, the passion that is at
the center of her decisionmaking is
that love of students, a teacher at
heart. This work, as you know, is not a
work done for a salary. It is not a work
done for even national recognition. It
is a work done out of a sense of oppor-
tunity to be transformative in the lives
of the young people around us.
Whether you sit on the far left or the
far right, Mr. Speaker, whatever your
politics of the day are, if there is one
thing that is worth celebrating, it is
those men and women back home who
make differences for the young people
in our lives.
Principal Kerensa Wing is such a per-
son, and it is with no small amount of
pride that I congratulate her today.
She was actually here in town, Mr.
Speaker, with her family, and if only
the House had been in session, I would
have been here to congratulate her. We
were back home working that week, so
I missed that opportunity to be with
her here in this Chamber. But I am not
going to miss the opportunity today in
this Chamber to tell her how much we
appreciate her, how much her students
appreciate her, and how much better
both Forsyth County and Gwinnett
County are that she, with her talents,
could work anywhere and live any-
where in the great United States of
America, Mr. Speaker, and she has cho-
sen our community to serve.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Principal Wing
and congratulate her.

especially for the poorest and most vul-
nerable in our society. Free these serv-
ants of Yours, O Lord, of all those at-
tachments to wealth or power or privi-
lege or fame that would prevent them
from following the course You have set
out for them. Make them mindful of
the time when they first heard Your
voice and followed it with idealism and
enthusiasm.
Illumine their minds, direct their
wills, stir up in them a holy passion for
doing what is right, despite the cost.
Give them the knowledge that when-
ever they strive for justice, they are
pleasing to You. And shower, O Lord,
Your choicest blessings upon our coun-
try.

family for many years, and I am hon-
ored to have brought him here to the
Nation’s Capital where, yesterday, he
addressed several dozen Members of
Congress, as well as their staff mem-
bers.
Bishop Barron was ordained as a
priest in the Archdiocese of Chicago 33
years ago. In July 2015, Pope Francis
appointed Bishop Barron to be the Aux-
iliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Los
Angeles. He is the founder of Word on
Fire Catholic Ministries, an innovative
new hub for spiritual and intellectual
formation, where he produces daily
meditations, weekly homilies, movies
on pivotal players in Catholic history,
reviews of movies, and debates with
sometimes-controversial thought lead-
ers of today’s culture.
Bishop Barron, as I said, is the sec-
ond-most followed Catholic on social
media, second only to the Pope. His
regular YouTube videos have been
viewed over 40 million times, and he
has over 1.7 million followers on
Facebook.
He is a number one Amazon best-
selling author and has published 16
books. He has created the
groundbreaking documentary ‘‘Catholi-
cism,’’ which aired on PBS. He has
eight other films and study programs.
He is a religious correspondent for
NBC and has appeared on FOX News

the Promoting Human Rights for Pal-
estinian Children Living Under Mili-
tary Occupation Act.
This endorsement by more than 300
respected rabbis sends a strong signal
by people of all faiths that every child
deserves to be treated with dignity and
respect, and that includes Palestinian
children. No longer can we ignore the
countless cases of mistreatment and
abuse of Palestinian children by the
Israeli military.
As a nation, we should no longer con-
done the detention of these children
with the support of our tax dollars.
So, again, I thank leaders of all
faiths, but especially these rabbis for
their commitment to human rights and
the rights of children and for standing
up and saying no more abuse of Pales-
tinian children.

RECOGNIZING DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of Domestic Vio-
lence Awareness Month to acknowledge
the strength of survivors and to call for
an end to the abuse experienced by
more than 2 million Americans each
year.
Throughout my career, I have fought
to end the cycle of domestic violence.
My contributions in the House of
Delegates in Virginia have helped
make the State have some of the
toughest criminal penalties for domes-
tic abusers. During that time, I
patroned legislation requiring domes-
tic abusers to undergo counseling and a
court-mandated treatment program. I
also worked across the aisle to make
strangulation a felony in Virginia’s
criminal code and make sure that abus-
ers charged with such a crime would
have the presumption against bail.
Congress must strive to protect vic-
tims and survivors, and I look forward
to working with my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle to pass commonsense
reforms that ensure safety and security
of those who suffer abuse.
f
ADDRESS RISING COST OF
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker,
since January, House Democrats have
gotten to work, passing legislation
that brings down healthcare costs and
protects the benefits of the Affordable
Care Act.
We have gone to court to fight
against the Trump administration’s ef-
forts to gut protections for folks with
preexisting conditions. We have al-
ready sent a package of legislation to
the Senate that will drive down the
price of prescription drugs. We are still
waiting on MITCH MCCONNELL to take
up these bills, but we are not stopping
there.
In the coming weeks, we will also
bring to the floor the Elijah Cummings
Lower Drug Costs Now Act, H.R. 3, the
single most significant piece of legisla-
tion to reduce drug costs, that empow-
ers patients and consumers against the
powerful pharmaceutical cartels in this
country.
This legislation levels the playing
field of working people in this country,
a country that pays more for prescrip-
tion drugs than anyplace else in the
world.
Our constituents want a government
that works for the people of this coun-
try. It is time for my Republican col-
leagues and Leader MCCONNELL to get
the message: Stop standing in the way.
Work with us so we can get the job
done and pass this important legisla-
tion that will address this very serious
issue, the rising cost of prescription
drugs.

SPECIAL OPERATIONS SUCCESS
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.
Madam Speaker, the successful raid by
the United States Special Forces re-
sulting in the death of the murderous
ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is a
significant victory for freedom.
Americans commend the military
and intelligence communities for their
diligent work in tracking a murderous
terrorist who committed atrocities,
leading to his cowardly suicide killing
children in Syria.
I am thankful for the decisive leader-
ship by President Donald Trump. Our
commitment to deny ISIS a safe haven
where they can launch attacks against
American families sends a message
that the U.S. and our allies stand ready
and determined to succeed in the fight
against terrorism.
National radio commentator Buck
Sexton, on Monday, correctly praised
our special operations success as ‘‘a big
deal.’’
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism,
just as, next week, we will cherish the
30th anniversary of Ronald Reagan’s
liberation of Europe from communist
socialism.

SUPPORTING IMAM TAHIR KUKIQI
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and

House for 1 minute.)
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam
Speaker, I rise today in support of
Imam Tahir Kukiqi, a public servant
and community leader who continues
to be denied fair consideration in his
immigration process.
This summer, Imam Tahir received
notice that USCIS intends to deport
him from the country he has called
home and raised his family for years.
The loss of Imam Tahir would be a
blow, not only to Staten Island, but to
all of New York City and the United
States. He has dedicated his life to
uniting diverse communities in soli-
darity and common understanding.
He hosts interfaith dialogues with
mosques, synagogues, churches, and
temples all across New York State. He
serves as the first Muslim chaplain to
the New York City Police Department
and has worked to build relationships
between the Muslim community and
law enforcement.
He has lived a life of public service
and represents the best of what it

Imam Tahir survived the war in
Kosovo and built a life for himself and
his son, Adem, right here in America.
He lost his wife and Adem’s mother
some years ago, and now Citizenship
and Immigration Services has threat-
ened to take away Adem’s father as
well.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues not to sit idly by while this
wonderful man, this public servant, is
removed from our country. I urge them
to join me in insisting that USCIS give
Imam Tahir a fair hearing and grant
him authorization to remain in this
country.
God bless Imam Tahir, and God bless
the United States of America.
f
RECOGNIZING GARDNER MINSHEW
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, long
before he captured the attention of
football fans with his exemplary play
and iconic 1970s style, Gardner
Minshew inspired my hometown in
Mississippi.
I remember sitting in the stands,
watching Gardner Minshew’s first
game when, as a freshman, he took
over for the injured starting Brandon
High School quarterback. I was among
many who watched the young man
grow and mature into a leader, both on
and off the field.
After four amazing seasons, Gardner
left Brandon and found his way to Pull-
man, Washington, to play for Wash-
ington State University. At Wash-
ington State, Gardner showed
composure in the face of adversity,
overcame all doubts, led the Cougars to
an 11-win season, and won the Johnny
Unitas award as the Nation’s top senior
quarterback.
Gardner has taken this same men-
tality to the NFL, where he now faces
a similar challenge. Just like his first
start in high school, when Gardner was
asked to step up and play at the next
level, Gardner was recently called on
to lead the Jacksonville Jaguars.
Again, Gardner overcame all doubts,
and he has continued to excel, just as
he did when I watched him on Friday
nights a few short years ago.
Madam Speaker, we know Gardner
will keep representing our State and
hometown well. Good luck, and go
Jags.
f
SHOULD ABUSE OF POWER BE
ALLOWED
(Mr. KENNEDY asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, ‘‘At
the bedrock of our politics will be a
total allegiance to the United States of
America, and through our loyalty to
our country, we will rediscover our loy-
alty to each other.’’ That was what
President Trump promised us on the
day he was inaugurated.
Over the past few months, our Presi-
dent has broken that promise. He has
lied. He has corrupted. He has ob-
structed.
Our President threatened the secu-
rity of an ally under attack unless they
were willing to investigate a fellow
American citizen, a political opponent,
to benefit his reelection campaign. And
he used your taxpayer dollars to do it.
His Chief of Staff has confirmed it.
The Ambassador of Ukraine confirmed
it. A Purple Heart recipient confirmed
it. The President admitted it himself.
So now, we have to decide if the lies,
the corruption, the coverups, and the
abuse of power should be allowed by
this President or any man or woman
who will hold office after him. That
choice should be clear.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
HONORING AMERICAN HERO STAN
CVAR
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, Vet-
erans Day is right around the corner.
In anticipation of this important holi-
day, I rise to recognize a veteran from
my district whose service and patriot-
ism has our whole community rallying
around him.
Stan Cvar is a World War II Navy
veteran who always flies the American
flag outside his home in Hibbing, Min-
nesota. Unfortunately, back in Sep-
tember, someone stole Stan’s American
flag from his property. Stan was dev-
astated, as the flag was not just a sym-
bol of the Nation he risked his life to
serve but a treasured gift from his son.
The fact that someone stole a cher-
ished American flag from a member of
the Greatest Generation was deeply up-
setting to many in the northland, my-
self included.
Next week, I will have the chance to
personally deliver a flag that was flown
over the United States Capitol to Stan
and his family. It will be an honor to
meet this American hero and offer him
a token of our gratitude.
Madam Speaker, as Veterans Day ap-
proaches, let us all remember that
after everything our veterans have
done for us, we must always ensure
that we are standing up for them.

PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICING
LEGISLATION
(Mr. HORSFORD asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker,
across America, seniors and families
are struggling to afford the prescrip-
tion drugs they need to stay healthy.
One of my constituents, Janet, a sen-
ior from Las Vegas, shared with me her
challenges in obtaining her medica-
tions. The blood thinners and choles-
terol medications she is prescribed are
so expensive that, if it weren’t for sam-
ples from her cardiologist, she wouldn’t
be able to obtain them at all.
Madam Speaker, seniors like Janet
should not have to beg for free samples
for access to the medicine they need.
That is why I introduced the SPIKE
Act, to increase transparency; the Cap-
ping Drug Costs for Seniors Act, to cap
at $2,000 prescription drug expenses for
seniors under Medicare part D; and
why I support H.R. 3, the Elijah Cum-
mings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues in this body to come together,
and let’s pass H.R. 3 together.
f
RECOGNIZING VOLUNTEERS AND
PUBLIC SERVANTS ACROSS
NORTH TEXAS
(Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the efforts of count-
less volunteers and public servants
across north Texas who helped ease the
burden of last week’s tornadoes.
When natural disaster strikes, fami-
lies suffer. It takes a strong commu-
nity to bring hope out of the wreckage.
Communities with solid foundations
do more than just rebuild homes, busi-
nesses, and schools. They help relieve
heartache that follows catastrophic
loss.
Countless faith-based and nonprofit
organizations, including the Network
of Community Ministries, the Amer-
ican Red Cross of North Texas, and
Texas Baptist Men, have risen to meet
the needs of our community. Alongside
partners such as Atmos Energy and
Oncor Electric, they have started the
arduous process of rebuilding our com-
munities.
Likewise, city leaders, like those in
Richardson and Dallas, have banded to-
gether to show support and provide val-
uable resources, proving once more
that we are always stronger together.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues
in the House of Representatives to join
me in thanking volunteers and leaders
throughout our region, not only for
helping to bring relief to those who
have been displaced from their homes
and schools, but also for providing
hope.

public’s top health priority for Con-
gress.
Most Americans say that prescrip-
tion drugs have made their lives better,
but for so many the cost is unreason-
able and unaffordable.
Insulin, which keeps more than 7 mil-
lion Americans alive, is an extreme ex-
ample. We have had insulin for nearly
100 years, yet my constituents, Utah
mothers whose kids have type I diabe-
tes, tell me that skyrocketing costs
have put this lifesaving medicine near-
ly out of reach.
My hometown newspaper recently
carried a story about volunteers criss-
crossing Utah to pick up leftover insu-
lin—because a family had extra or a di-
abetic family member died—and deliv-
ering that medicine where it is needed.
They call it ‘‘Diabetic Christmas,’’ a
sad commentary on just how badly our
system is failing our patients.
We need actions to offer relief that
bring down costs so that people don’t
have to celebrate Diabetic Christmas
in order to stay alive and stay healthy.
This week, we passed a bill with
unanimous bipartisan support that
makes drug pricing more transparent
and makes it easier for seniors on
Medicare drug plans to understand
their benefits and their costs. It is a
good step forward, but we have more
work to do.
f
VETERANS DAY
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, in
a few days, our Nation will celebrate
Veterans Day, a time to pause, give
thanks, and honor the brave men and
women who have served our country.
Those men and women who have
worn the uniform of our Nation, who
have sacrificed so much for us, deserve
more than just words in return. We owe
them action. That means keeping the
promises we have made to our veterans
to provide skills and offer opportuni-
ties as these men and women transi-
tion to civilian life; to provide a life-
time of healthcare that they have
earned and were guaranteed; to support
access to mental health services, in-
cluding to those with other than hon-
orable discharges who may have been
improperly dismissed from the service
due to undiagnosed brain injuries or
PTSD; and to end the scourge of vet-
eran homelessness, as we have done in
Lake County, in my district in Illinois.
To that end, I am proud of the bipar-
tisan legislation I introduced to reau-
thorize the Boots to Business entrepre-
neurship training program for vet-
erans, previously passed in the House,
and I urge my colleagues in the Senate
to similarly support this and other im-
portant programs.
This Veterans Day, and every day, I
hope we will all do more to remember
the privileges we enjoy as Americans
and honor those who served us as a
small token of our thanks.
SCHOOL INFRASTRUCTURE
(Mr. RUIZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, earlier
this month, James Madison Elemen-
tary School in Indio, California, closed
after rust, mold, and corrosion were
found in the columns and the walls
supporting the building, compromising
the school’s infrastructure and putting
students, teachers, and staff at risk.
This is symptomatic of outdated and
weak infrastructure in schools
throughout our Nation. Thankfully,
the Desert Sands Unified School Dis-
trict board closed the school and trans-
ferred students to another facility.
The cost of our schools’ outdated in-
frastructure is adding up. We need big
and bold investments in school infra-
structure to keep our students safe,
prevent school closures, and help our
students compete.
That is why I cosponsored and urge a
vote on the Rebuilding America’s
Schools Act of 2019, to invest $100 bil-
lion in schools’ much-needed physical
and digital infrastructure.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to cosponsor H.R. 865, the Re-
building America’s Schools Act of 2019,
and prioritize students’ well-being,
safety, and education.
f
LOWER THE COST OF
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
(Mr. WELCH asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, very
soon in this House, we will have a
chance to do something that America
needs done, America wants done, and
we can do it together, and that is to
lower the cost of prescription drugs in
honor of our wonderful Elijah Cum-
mings.
The United States is the only major
country where the government of the
people does not protect the people
against price gouging by the pharma-
ceutical industry. We have got to
change that.
Our drug bill will bring down prices
over a half a trillion dollars. That will
start to alleviate the pressure on pre-
miums that is coming at the expense of
raises for workers.
The benefit of this approach will not
just be for our Medicare and Medicaid
programs—really important pro-
grams—but the lower prices will ben-
efit employer-sponsored healthcare as
well.
So, if you are taking medication that
is insulin, or if you are taking medica-
tion in an EpiPen, you are going to get
a lower price. But, even if you are for-
tunate that you don’t need the medica-
tion, your premiums are going to go
down.
Madam Speaker, let’s come together
and pass this reduction in horrible
medical expenses.
SPOTLIGHTING THE NEEDS OF
RURAL AMERICA
(Mr. DELGADO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. DELGADO. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to put a spotlight on rural
America and urge Congress to pass my
bill, the Rebuild Rural America Act.
Rural America is being left behind.
In my district, the eighth most rural in
the country, we are still fighting for
broadband access and consistent cell
service.
With so much of the private market
focusing on population density in order
to achieve high returns on capital in-
vestment, many of our less populated
communities are left to their own de-
vices.
Here, at the Federal level, where the
public good is contemplated, we must
ensure that no community is boxed out
of the future. That is why I introduced
the Rebuild Rural America Act, which
creates the rural future partnership
fund and provides $50 billion for non-
competitive, 5-year, renewable block
grants to certified rural regions to im-
plement locally developed revitaliza-
tion plans.
This bill helps communities that
don’t have the resources to navigate
the complex Federal grants process to
secure Federal funding for important
projects, and it would move the Fed-
eral Government away from being com-
plicated, siloed, and top-down into a
more responsive and effective partner
for our rural communities.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to pass the Rebuild Rural
America Act.

RECOGNIZING U.S. RECOGNITION

sional Armenian Caucus, I rise in rec-
ognition of yesterday’s historic passage
of H. Res. 296 to affirm the United
States’ recognition of the Armenian
genocide.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to rep-
resent many people of Armenian de-
scent who live in northern New Jersey.
In Bergen County, we hold an annual
ceremony on April 24 to remember the
day in 1915 when hundreds of Armenian
intellectuals were rounded up and ulti-
mately murdered at the beginning of
the Armenian genocide.
The massacre of 1.5 million Arme-
nians, as well as Greeks, Assyrians,
Chaldeans, Syriacs, Arameans,
Maronities, and other Christians, by
the Ottoman Empire constituted the
20th century’s first genocide.
As a Jewish American, the need to
recognize genocide is deeply personal
for me. My relatives lost their entire
family during the Nazi attempt to ex-
terminate European Jewry.

There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 656 and rule
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in
the Committee of the Whole House on
the state of the Union for the consider-

The Chair appoints the gentlewoman

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
consideration of the bill (H.R. 1373) to
protect, for current and future genera-
tions, the watershed, ecosystem, and
cultural heritage of the Grand Canyon
region in the State of Arizona, and for
other purposes, with Ms. SÁNCHEZ in
the chair.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the
bill is considered read the first time.
General debate shall be confined to
the bill and shall not exceed 1 hour
equally divided and controlled by the
chair and ranking minority member of
the Committee on Natural Resources.
The gentleman from Arizona (Mr.
GRIJALVA) and the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. GOSAR) each will control 30
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA).
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Chair, I want to start today
with a story.
Near the south rim of the Grand Can-
yon sits Canyon Mine, a breccia pipe
uranium mine in the middle of the
Kaibab National Forest, only a few
miles from the boundary of the Grand
Canyon National Park.
This mine opened in 1986 after assur-
ances that its operations would have
minimal impact and that they
wouldn’t impact groundwater.
Mind you, since it opened three dec-
ades ago, uranium production has
never occurred at the site. Uranium ore
has never come out of the mine.
What has come out of the mine is
over 20 million gallons of groundwater,
polluted with uranium and arsenic
from the ore body. The water has
flowed into the mine ever since the
mine operator pierced a groundwater
aquifer in 2016.
Again, the mine operator had assured
regulators its mine shaft would be dry.
The situation is so dire that the mine
operator regularly resorts to spraying
this uranium-contaminated water into
the air to speed evaporation. On windy
days, this spray has been known to
travel off the site and into the sur-
rounding areas and environment.
Meanwhile, the mine shaft continues
to fill with contaminated water.
There are really only a few places
that water might go if it escapes the
mine shaft: down toward other
aquifers, including those that feed the
water to the Supai Village and Havasu
Falls, or to the seeps and springs that
flow into the Grand Canyon and, even-
tually, to the Colorado River itself.
b 1230
Supai village has been the home of
the Havasupai people for more than
1,000 years. They have made this can-
yon their home. Their history is there.
Their homes are there. Their lives are
there. Yet this mine puts all that at
risk.
Again, no ore production has oc-
curred at this site, but it has already
degraded millions of gallons of clean
water and put lives and culture at risk.
And that contamination risk will only
get worse once mining commences and
the water is exposed to more and more
uranium ore.
This isn’t a unique example. The
Pine Nut mine on the North Rim of the
Grand Canyon was thought closed and
capped for two decades, but in 2009 the
mine was discovered to have unexpect-
edly filled with over two million gal-
lons of radioactively contaminated
water.
Uranium mines across the southwest
pollute our water, endanger our com-
munities and our health, and despite
assurances, hundreds of these sites are
still waiting to be cleaned up, particu-
larly those mines that impact Tribal
communities.
Madam Chair, for Arizonans, for the
Havasupai, and for countless others
across the southwest, the mineral
withdrawal made permanent by H.R.
1373 is not theoretical and it is not
trivial. I rise today to ask for this
House’s support for protecting clean
water, protecting the health of our
communities, and protecting the public
lands and environment on which we all
rely.
The bill before us today permanently
extends an existing temporary morato-
rium on new mining claims on public
lands surrounding the Grand Canyon
National Park, to prevent another can-
yon or Pine Nut mine from threatening
our communities and our livelihoods.
This House needs to act on this pro-
posal because these critical protections
are under threat from the Trump ad-
ministration.
Under the guise of energy dominance
and fabricated arguments about na-
tional security, they have continually
pushed for these lands to be open to ex-
ploitation on behalf of a few wealthy
mining interests. The idea that we
need to mine around the Grand Can-
yon—mind you, the Grand Canyon—to
meet our energy needs is patently
false. There is ample data to show it,
and national security and nuclear non-
proliferation experts have routinely
raised the alarm that this fear-
mongering about supplies is based on
fantasy. It is time to stop rehashing
the same worn out arguments. We
shouldn’t be mining for uranium
around the Grand Canyon, period.
This is an effort I have been involved
in for over a decade, and I hope we can
move forward today. I urge my col-
leagues to help me protect access to
clean water and a healthy environment
for the people of Arizona by supporting
H.R. 1373, the Grand Canyon Centennial
Protection Act.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume. I
rise in opposition to H.R. 1373, the so-
called Grand Canyon Centennial Pro-
tection Act. It is an antimining attack
on northern Arizona and my district.
This legislation imposes a massive
land grab of more than one million
acres, permanently banning mining
and other multiple-use activities in an
area nearly the size of Delaware. The
withdrawal is also, I would like to
point out, very far outside the Grand
Canyon. The actual Grand Canyon, of
course, is already subject to a mul-
titude of Federal protections.
Around one-third of the proposed
withdrawal area in this bill is in my
district. The rest is in Representative
O’HALLERAN’s district. And none of the
lands in this bill are in the sponsor of
this bill, Representative GRIJALVA’s,
district.
This bill would have direct negative
impacts on six counties in Arizona and
Utah, with an estimated two to 4,000
jobs lost and $29 billion in foregone
overall economic activity. The with-
drawal area also contains 4,204 acres
belonging to the Arizona State Land
Department for the benefit of Arizona’s
school children. This withdrawal will
mean hundreds of millions of dollars in
lost revenue for local communities and
for our schools. I think every single
school district is hurting for money in
Arizona.
Further, the majority of the active
and historic mining claims are in my
district, and the main point of this bill
is to lock up those lands for mineral
development.
I said that this is an attack on north-
ern Arizona, and that is true, but that
is not all. This bill is a specific, tar-
geted attempt to prevent access to the

highest grade and largest quantity of
uranium reserves in the country. In
doing so, this legislation has serious
defense and energy security implica-
tions for the entire Nation.
Uranium is a uniquely valuable ele-
ment. It is a source of renewable en-
ergy and also an irreplaceable applica-
tion in defense and medicine. And yet,
domestic uranium production in 2018
was 33 percent lower than in 2017. This
year those numbers are likely to be
even worse. Our domestic industry is
disappearing. If nothing is done, it will
be completely gone in just a few years.
Look at what has happened with our
timber industry in Arizona. We have
completely wiped out the mechanism,
and now we are victims of catastrophic
wildfires.
During consideration of this bill in
committee, my colleagues across the
aisle claimed that we source most of
our uranium from allies like Canada
and Australia. But they neglected to
mention that a Canadian mine, which
provided 15 percent of the global ura-
nium supply, closed just last year. An
Australian mine is scheduled to stop
operations in 2021 after 40 years of min-
ing.
But why is this? Why is our domestic
industry struggling to stay in business
and the uranium supply from our
friends in Canada and Australia shrink-
ing?
Well, the largest uranium producer in
the world is Kazakhstan, and together
with Russia and Uzbekistan, these
countries have been deliberately trying
to ‘‘corner’’ the global market. Yes, I
said it. Corner the global market. They
are pushing the price of uranium down
to artificially low levels and driving
competitors in the United States and
elsewhere out of business. In fact,
China is joining in it too, buying up
mines in Namibia.
We currently import about 97 percent
of our uranium from foreign sources.
As of 2018, the majority of our uranium
imports now come from hostile nations
like Russia. This is not always the
case, but the problem has gotten worse
and worse over time, especially in re-
cent years. I think all of us here today
should consider that very alarming.
Now, my colleagues on the other side
of the aisle have cited concerns about
water quality as a reason to prevent
mining in the withdrawal area. But, in
fact, successful uranium mining oc-
curred in the 1980s. These mines were
reclaimed so well that you can’t tell
where they have even existed. There
was no damage done to the Grand Can-
yon watershed. In fact, they may have
improved the watershed. And due to
the small footprint of a typical breccia
pipe operation, usually less than 40
acres, even if every mining claim in
the area became a mine, only a small
fraction of the withdrawal area would
be affected.
Keep in mind that this is an area
where mining and other multiple-use
activities can coexist. In fact, a thor-
oughly-negotiated compromise to do
just that was created by the Arizona
Wilderness Act of 1984, supported by
the entire Arizona and Utah delega-
tions. 387,000 acres of land was added to
the National Wilderness Preservation
System in exchange for 540 acres to be
available for multiple use, including
mining.
Unfortunately, some of the environ-
mental groups involved in that com-
promise have forgotten why it was
made. Attempts to withdraw this area
have returned with very strong opposi-
tion from my constituents and resi-
dents of northern Arizona.
There is no question that H.R. 1373
will hurt local revenues, kill jobs, and
undermine American energy security.
It is opposed by the people of my dis-
trict, and I urge my colleagues to join
me in opposition.
Madam Chairwoman, I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I rec-
ognize my colleague from Arizona—
that was accurately stated, that he
represents 70 percent of the designated
area in this legislation.
I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman
from Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN).
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Chair, I
rise today to speak in support of the
Grand Canyon Centennial Protection
Act, legislation that would ban ura-
nium mining in and near the Grand
Canyon.
I am proud to represent Arizona’s
First Congressional District, which is
home to the Grand Canyon. Our canyon
is a national treasure with cultural sig-
nificance to Native American Tribes
and Nations throughout the region, as
well as home to the Havasupai Tribe.
The Grand Canyon brings in over 6
million visitors each year. In 2018,
these visitors spent $1.2 billion in the
local economy and supported over
12,000 jobs. The Grand Canyon is also
home to the Colorado River, the water
supply for an enormous portion of the
southwest region.
Potential contamination of the water
by uranium mining would have a ripple
effect that would devastate the 40 mil-
lion people that rely on the Colorado
River and local aquifers. Unfortu-
nately, areas in and near the canyon
are plagued by the toxic legacy of ura-
nium mining to this day.
Currently, there are over 500 aban-
doned uranium mines in the Navajo
Nation alone. They have been there for
80 years. The Federal Government has
an obligation to clean them up, as did
the mining companies that abandoned
them.
Cancer diagnoses in the region are
extremely high and are directly linked
to uranium mining activity dating
back to the Cold War.
Today, I urge my colleagues to join
me in voting to pass the Grand Canyon
Centennial Protection Act. This com-
monsense bill protects our canyon, the
health of northern Arizonans, the
water supply of the southwest, and the
growth of our State’s economy by ban-
ning uranium mining in and near the
Grand Canyon.
Additionally, I want to note that this
withdrawal of uranium mining does not
jeopardize our energy market or our
national security by forcing us to seek
foreign sources. We are actually seek-
ing foreign sources now because our
cost is not competitive with world
prices.
According to Federal data, both New
Mexico and Wyoming have three times
the amount of uranium reserves as Ari-
zona, Colorado, and Utah have com-
bined. Our uranium imports are lower
than they have been in 15 years, and
Canada, our ally, is our largest supplier
along with Australia, another ally.
I am proud to stand today in support
of the Grand Canyon Centennial Pro-
tection Act, because the Grand Canyon
is too precious to lose. I implore my
colleagues to vote in support of this
legislation.
The Arizona land trust is for the
schools. This land may not be used for
uranium mining, but it could be used
for anything else to be able to address
the issues of funding schools in Ari-
zona. And, again, the mine that the
chairman mentioned has a reason to be
closed.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chairwoman, I
want to explain. This is a cross-section
of geological formations. These yellow
areas are called the breccia pipes. What
ends up happening is these alluvial fans
actually direct water. Uranium is
water soluble. This is the Grand Can-
yon down here. This is where the
springs come through. So what ends up
happening is it dissolves into water,
and it comes into the water.
So it seems like to me, what we
would want to do is get rid of that so
there was not a perpetual leaching into
the subsurface water. Geology tells us
a lot.
Madam Chairwoman, I yield 41⁄2 min-
utes to the gentleman from California
(Mr. MCCLINTOCK).
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Chairwoman, when I chaired
the Federal Lands Subcommittee a few
years ago, the ranking Democratic
member was from Massachusetts. She
shared the Democrats’ goal of having
the Federal Government acquire as
much land in the west as it possibly
could. Try as I might, I could never im-
press upon her the difference between a
State like Massachusetts, where the
Federal Government owns only 1.2 per-
cent of the land, and a State like mine,
California, where it controls 46 percent.
I have got one county in my district
where the Federal Government owns 93
percent of the land.
And I tried in vain to get her to un-
derstand the dire economic implica-
tions for her district if the Federal
Government one day seized 46 percent
of her State, took it off the tax rolls,
restricted public access, and forbade
any productive use on it. What would
that do to her State’s economy? Yet,
that is precisely what the Federal Gov-
ernment has done to the west.
Now, the Federal Government owns
39 percent of the State of Arizona. Our

holdings include the largest deposit of
high-grade uranium ore in the United
States, one of the largest in the world.
Its development is critically important
to our future defense and energy needs
at a time when 93 percent of the ura-
nium we use comes from foreign gov-
ernments.
Now, the Federal Government not
only owns these critical deposits, it is
responsible to the American people for
their wise management and productive
use.
Now, a rational person might say,
well, thank God we can be independent
of foreign governments and develop
these reserves for the benefit of tax-
payers and the economy. A rational
person might say that.
But, of course, this bill is anything
but rational. It would close these Fed-
eral lands, a million acres of them, far
from the Grand Canyon, I might add,
just to be clear, and forbid the Amer-
ican people from benefiting from these
rich uranium deposits on the land that
the American people own.
b 1245
This bill imposes a completely irra-
tional total prohibition on the develop-
ment of these resources and devastates
the economic potential for the commu-
nities nearby.
Indeed, this bill is most strongly op-
posed by the local representative from
these communities, Congressman
GOSAR. The elected county supervisor
from Mohave County came to Wash-
ington to plead with the Democrats not
to hobble the economy of their rural
district in this way. Once again, the
Democrats dismissed the pleas of local
residents in order to scratch their own
ideological itch to seize as much land
as they can and put it off-limits to the
American people.
Madam Chair, I would remind the
Democrats that this was the practice
of the early Kings of England. They set
aside one-third of the English country-
side, declared them to be the King’s
Forests, off-limits to the common peo-
ple. This practice so enraged the
English people that no fewer than five
clauses in the Magna Carta were writ-
ten to redress their grievance.
Not content to limit such dev-
astating restrictions to the Federal
lands, this measure would also ham-
string mining on tens of thousands of
acres of State trust fund lands, which
help fund Arizona’s public schools and
hospitals.
The Democrats have waged a war
against agriculture and mining for
many years now. This bill is just their
latest ham-handed example.
I think the American people need to
wake up to what a devastating future
these policies will produce. Think
about this: Everything that we touch,
everything that provides for our sur-
vival, our comfort, our quality of life,
absolutely everything, is either mined
or is grown. I don’t know of any excep-
tions.
I think it is time we carefully con-
sider the nihilism of the modern left
and where it would take our commu-
nities and where it would take our
country before it is too late.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Arizona (Mrs. KIRKPATRICK), my
colleague.
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Madam Chair, I
rise in support of H.R. 1373, the Grand
Canyon Centennial Protection Act.
I have lived in Arizona my entire life,
born and raised there. I remember fre-
quently visiting the canyon as a child,
marveling at its magnificence and its
beauty. I have hiked down the Grand
Canyon with my family, camped on the
banks of the Colorado River. It is not a
place where we should have uranium
mining.
There are many Native American
Tribes who live in that area and who
consider that a sacred site. For hun-
dreds of years, their ancestors visited
the Grand Canyon. They continue to
worship there and have ceremonial
sites in the Grand Canyon.
We just cannot allow this kind of
contamination to continue. The prob-
lem with uranium mining is that the
retroactive disposal of uranium is very,
very difficult to clear from the land.
The CHAIR. The time of the gentle-
woman has expired.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I
yield an additional 30 seconds to the
gentlewoman.
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Madam Chair,
one more point. When it rains in that
watershed, rain carries that uranium
contamination to our stock tanks and
ponds, and then that contamination
goes into our cattle.
Madam Chair, this is a very serious
issue. I urge my colleagues to support
H.R. 1373.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I might consume.
Madam Chair, I thank the gentle-
woman from Arizona (Mrs. KIRK-
PATRICK) for acknowledging that.
We are going to go back to learning
about geology. Once again, we have
these breccia pipes, and you can see
them on this location on the platform
here.
Now, let’s look at something that
naturally occurs in the next picture.
What do you think this is? This is an
exposed breccia pipe next to an alluvial
fan.
This is exactly what she was talking
about. When water and air get to this,
it immerses it into the water and car-
ries it down.
This is a concentrated supply of ura-
nium. Wouldn’t it be better to mine
that area? That is what we have to get
after. It is safe; it is effective; and it
will show some mitigation.
Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to
the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.
WESTERMAN).
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Chair, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 1373, the Grand Canyon
Centennial Protection Act.
This bill is very cleverly named to
imply that it is safeguarding the Grand
Canyon, something I believe that we
all support. After all, who wouldn’t
want to protect one of our Nation’s
most iconic natural sites?
But when we look at what this bill
actually does, we quickly see that it
has very little to do with the Grand
Canyon. Instead, it is a Federal land
grab that would lock up approximately
1 million acres of public land in north-
ern Arizona and permanently ban min-
eral development.
Let me make this clear: H.R. 1373,
the so-called Grand Canyon Centennial
Protection Act, focuses on land outside
Grand Canyon National Park, miles
away from the canyon.
To hear this policy described, it
sounds like we would be backing back-
hoes and trucks right up to the canyon
and chipping off the rim of the canyon,
but that is just not so. This is land
very far outside of the park.
This policy is progressive. It progres-
sively increases outside bureaucratic
control over more Federal land.
The policy and the world view that
supports it reminds me of the story of
the greedy farmer. He said he didn’t
want all the land; he just wanted the
land that bordered his land. Policy like
this doesn’t claim to want all the land;
it just wants to put the land in protec-
tion that borders the land that is in
protection. Someday, there won’t be
any land left if we continue imple-
menting policies like this.
As Mr. GOSAR has already pointed
out, the land up for debate is in his and
Mr. O’HALLERAN’s districts, not Mr.
GRIJALVA’s, and closing its develop-
ment would result in hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars of lost revenue for local
schools and communities.
One of the common arguments
against mineral development is that it
disrupts wildlife habitats and water
supplies, but we have seen this dis-
proved time and time again. A strong
economy and environmental steward-
ship can coexist.
The Arizona Geological Survey pub-
lished a report outlining uranium min-
ing in this part of Arizona, showing
how mining here would not contami-
nate the Colorado River, the Grand
Canyon, or any of the surrounding wa-
tersheds.
We have also seen how areas that
were mined in the past have been suc-
cessfully reclaimed. As modern mining
techniques and technology continue
improving, this process will only be-
come more efficient and advanced.
Finally, we cannot have a discussion
about barring natural resource devel-
opment on public lands without ad-
dressing the far and wide-ranging geo-
political repercussions. Our domestic
uranium industry is currently sup-
plying less than 1 percent of the ura-
nium necessary to fuel U.S. nuclear re-
actors. Despite a vast domestic supply
of uranium, much of it is inaccessible
due to laws like H.R. 1373.
This means the U.S. is forced to
outsource its uranium supply from
countries like Russia, Uzbekistan, and

Chinese-owned mines in Namibia. With
geopolitical tensions constantly in-
creasing, it is foolish for us to continue
relying so heavily on countries that
have proven themselves to be un-
friendly to the U.S.
If we permanently ban mineral devel-
opment on another vast expanse of
land, we are overtly threatening Amer-
ican energy and economic security, and
I believe we are promoting less envi-
ronmental stewardship around the
globe.
I have seen this story play out over
and over again. My Democratic col-
leagues claim to be concerned about
environmental safety and security, but
their only solution is to lock up mil-
lions of acres and throw away the key.
I ask: Wouldn’t our time be better
spent finding smart energy solutions
that are sustainable and environ-
mentally friendly and that provide
American jobs?
If we want the U.S. to continue lead-
ing the world in long-term energy solu-
tions, this must be our approach.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Arizona (Mr. STANTON), my colleague.
Mr. STANTON. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentleman, Chairman GRI-
JALVA, for yielding, and for his leader-
ship as the chairman of the Natural
Resources Committee, and as the sen-
ior member of our Arizona delegation.
Today, I rise in support of H.R. 1373,
the Grand Canyon Centennial Protec-
tion Act.
When people think of Arizona, they
most often conjure up images of the
Grand Canyon. It is our State’s great-
est treasure and one of the most iconic
natural wonders on Earth.
It took nearly 2 billion years for the
Colorado River and its tributaries to
cut through layer after layer of rock to
form the canyon. The spectacular scene
is something best experienced in per-
son, which is why it is one of the most
visited national parks in our country.
The park is a key economic driver for
northern Arizona’s economy. Last
year, the Grand Canyon welcomed 6.3
million visitors, bringing almost $1 bil-
lion of value to our local economies.
President Teddy Roosevelt, who des-
ignated the Grand Canyon a national
monument in 1908, said: ‘‘Leave it as it
is. You cannot improve upon it. The
ages have been at work on it, and man
can only mar it.’’
We could not agree more.
As we celebrate the park’s centennial
this year, we must take the necessary
action to preserve this natural land-
scape for future generations to experi-
ence.
The bill before us today, which
makes permanent a ban on new ura-
nium mining permits on nearly 1 mil-
lion acres around the canyon, is that
necessary action. It is a vital step to
protect this delicate ecosystem, the
significant number of species that call
it home, as well as the Colorado River
watershed on which millions of people
rely for water.
This legislation has strong support
from leaders and industries across our
State, from our Tribal nations to cities
and counties, to recreation and envi-
ronmental organizations.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to join us in preserving the Grand Can-
yon and supporting this important bill.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I might consume.
Madam Chair, it is great that the
gentleman brought this up. So once
again, let’s go back to our geological
timeframe.
This water cuts through. This is the
Grand Canyon. This is the shelf that
you go over and look over at the beau-
tiful, majestic aspect of the river.
Look at what we have cut across,
these breccia pipes. Once again, this is
exposure. It is water-soluble, air-solu-
ble. It goes back into the watershed.
Once again, we are talking about up
here, where mitigation should be very,
very important.
Madam Chair, I yield 4 minutes to
the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.
STAUBER). He has been a stalwart per-
son in regard to the mining industry;
that it is a way of life in northern Min-
nesota.
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Chair, I rise
today with my colleagues in opposition
to this harmful legislation.
Today, the other side of the aisle is
kowtowing to the wealthy and elite en-
vironmental lobby by ignoring science
and facts and legislating over the needs
of rural communities. This heavy-
handed Federal approach ignores po-
tential revenues generated from State
trust lands that would flow to schools
and our local communities.
I feel like we are living in the movie
‘‘Groundhog Day’’ sometimes. Time
and time again, locals who live on
these lands, who work in the area, who
raise their families there, who rep-
resent these districts are supportive of
these projects. Those who often know
nothing about the local projects, the
economy, or the environment are the
ones who are inserting themselves in
opposition.
This illustrates the vast divide be-
tween the realities for local commu-
nities and the visions of environ-
mentalists. What these visions tend to
ignore is that the choice is a binary
one. We either get these minerals need-
ed for our everyday life, renewable en-
ergy, and national security from right
here in the United States, or we import
them from places like Russia,
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Chinese-
owned mines in Africa.
Do these countries have the same
standards in place as we do to protect
the environment? Madam Chair, the
answer is no.
Do these foreign mines hire workers
with high-wage salaries? Madam Chair,
the answer is no.
Are these mines required to comply
with a regulatory agency like the Mine
Safety and Health Administration?
Madam Chair, the answer is no.
Do Russia and China have our best
national security interests in mind?
Madam Chair, the answer is no.
Therefore, this legislation is baffling.
Our enemies abroad could not have
written a better bill to benefit their
economies and national security goals
while simultaneously damaging ours.
Instead of arbitrarily deciding that
mining is wrong, Madam Chair, let’s
look at the facts. One, it is
unsustainable and irresponsible to con-
tinue our reliance on foreign adver-
saries for our minerals. Two, mining
and a pristine environment are not mu-
tually exclusive.
Madam Chair, I encourage anybody
in this body to come to northern Min-
nesota and view our reclaimed mines,
which are home to the cleanest drink-
ing water in the State of Minnesota.
b 1300
Or, how about visiting the Hermit
Mine in Arizona. This was a functional
uranium mine in the 1980s. It is now
fully reclaimed with a pristine land-
scape.
We need these minerals. Let’s stand
up against antiscience scare tactics
and vote against this bill and in sup-
port of good jobs, renewable energy,
and national security for our country.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, may I in-
quire as to how much time I have.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from Ari-
zona has 12 minutes remaining.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman
from Nevada (Mr. HORSFORD), a mem-
ber of the Natural Resources Com-
mittee.
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Chair, I rise
today in strong support of H.R. 1373,
the Grand Canyon Centennial Protec-
tion Act.
This bill ensures that uranium min-
ing will not irreversibly contaminate
the sensitive habitats and clean water
of the Colorado River watershed, which
provides drinking water to nearly 30
million Americans, including some of
my constituents in Nevada.
While uranium and other hard rock
mining can help foster economic activ-
ity, as it has done in my home State of
Nevada, it can also threaten commu-
nity health. In my district, I have seen
the impacts that uranium contamina-
tion can have on local communities in
the town of Yerington and the
Yerington Paiute Tribe.
For decades, uranium contamination
has persisted in this area, endangering
the health of my constituents and forc-
ing families to stop drinking from
their taps, literally having to rely on
bottled water. Sadly, cleanup of this
site and others like it often takes
much longer than it should, leaving
families to choose between leaving
their homes or living amongst health
hazards.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to work on this bill to support this leg-
islation in a bipartisan tradition and to
vote to protect the Grand Canyon re-
gion and Colorado River watershed
from the damaging impacts of uranium
mining.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8613
October 30, 2019
Madam Chair, once again, let’s look
at mitigation. The previous speaker on
our side, Mr. STAUBER from Minnesota,
actually talked about it.
Well, here is an active mine site
called the Pigeon Mine. This is what it
looked like: a footprint of less than 40
acres; right around 30 acres. And this is
it, newly minted right as it was done
for reclamation. In 2 years, you are not
going to be able to find anything here.
Once again, look at what we are deal-
ing with here. This is an exposed brec-
cia pipe. Any water, any rain, any
snow, any air will actually dissolve
this and put it in the air—not just ura-
nium, but arsenic as well. These are
eroded away.
Once again, geology teaches you ev-
erything you need to know. Once
again, all these breccia pipes are built
here.
Here is the Grand Canyon. We are not
doing anything here. But look at the
exposure here for the uranium leaching
into the subsurface and into the Colo-
rado River—not just that, but arsenic
as well.
Look at what we are mining up on
here, protecting and clearing that out.
And you can see that their mitigation
is exemplary.
Eighty years ago, we abandoned a
bunch of mines, but a lot of Federal
Government was to blame about that.
We also heard the dissertation in re-
gards to the park could generate all
sorts of other revenue. Well, the last
time I looked, the park wasn’t gener-
ating; they were going in the negative.
In fact, the backlog on maintenance is
over $12 billion.
The government doesn’t run these
very, very well, and this is a great op-
portunity for multiple use. It actually
cleans the water, improves the drain-
age into the subsurface water, and gets
to a problem with a solution that
works and has been trusted.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM).
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Chair, the
Grand Canyon Centennial Protection
Act is an important bill to protect one
of America’s most iconic national
parks and elevate the voices of Tribal
communities.
Tribal leaders from across the South-
west have called on Congress to perma-
nently protect this region from ura-
nium mining. These communities have
seen firsthand the devastating impact
uranium extraction could have on their
lives, on their health, and the health of
their children.
For example, the Havasupai Tribe
live in the bottom of the Grand Can-
yon. Uranium contamination of the
aquifers that sustain their land would
destroy their drinking water, their
farms, and kill their livestock. Even
their ability to remain on their Tribal
homeland is at risk.
It is time for Congress to listen to
these Tribal leaders. It is time for Con-
gress to stand up for future generations
who are relying upon us for clean
water, public lands, cultural heritage,
and other priceless resources.
As a chair of the Interior, Environ-
ment, and Related Agencies Appropria-
tions Subcommittee, I hear from
Americans about the value of con-
serving our public lands and protecting
our air and our water. The Trump ad-
ministration’s agenda puts that all at
risk by prioritizing profits for mining
companies over our public health and
the health of our environment.
In my home State of Minnesota, the
Trump administration’s push to mine
at any cost jeopardizes the Boundary
Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, our Na-
tion’s most visited wilderness area.
Congress needs to state clearly and
emphatically that some places are just
simply too important and too precious
to exploit. Today, we take a stand to
protect the lands and waters sur-
rounding the Grand Canyon, one of the
earliest and most iconic national
parks.
Madam Chair, I support H.R. 1373,
and I urge my colleagues to do the
same.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, once again, geology
tells us everything we need to know.
Once again, the gentlewoman actually
talked about the Boundary Waters
Canoe Area Wilderness. Once again, I
feel sorry for the public being misused
and used like pawns by the other side
about the misnomer.
Once again, the Grand Canyon—this
is the Grand Canyon. There is nothing
going on right here. Oh, I forgot. Water
runs down, dissolves uranium and ar-
senic, and puts it into the water.
What we are talking about is mitiga-
tion on this plateau. This is outside the
Grand Canyon experience. This is what
is so important is that this is helping
out the health and the strength of the
purity of water. That is the key here.
Not only that, but the last time I
knew, Arizona fights over water be-
cause we have to drink whiskey. We
want clean water here, so we are ena-
bling, actually, clean water here.
Once again, there are dozens of fights
for the conversation we are having
today. The American people are being
used like pawns. They don’t know what
is right. Go back to geology. The geol-
ogy sets you free.
You have seen the mitigation. Yes, 80
years ago, there wasn’t great mitiga-
tion. That was a big part of the U.S.
Government and its oversight. But
now, there is great opportunity for this
to happen. We are not talking about
the Grand Canyon. It is outside on the
plateau.
Once again, as these are exposed
through erosion, you have contamina-
tion of subsurface water. It seems to
me like we should actually clean it up.
The other thing I keep hearing about
is we have got plenty of supplies. Well,
my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle are so narrow-sided that they for-
got about: How did China actually
grow to own the world market of rare
earths? I mean, think about that. In
order to have a cell phone, you have
got to have these critical minerals and
rare earths.
In the trade debate, what did China
threaten us with? Withholding rare
earths.
Why do we have some of our leading
battery technology over in China? Be-
cause we didn’t have supply chains
here.
The other side talks about
globalization. Well, let’s talk about
globalization. Nobody—let me repeat—
nobody—in the world does mining like
the U.S. No one does it under the same
protections, and the same protections
for the workers—nobody.
And if we are talking about
globalization, which always keeps com-
ing out of the other side’s mouth, well,
then we ought to be bringing all this
home so that we are the entrepreneur,
we are the one forcing this issue, and
we are the one who controls our own
destiny.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman
from Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY).
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Chair, I
thank the chairman for his leadership
on this bill and his unwavering com-
mitment to both his home State and
our environment.
Madam Chair, this legislation isn’t
just about protecting our land and nat-
ural resources for generations to come.
It isn’t just about ensuring the water
rights for the Havasupai Tribe and in-
digenous people our country has long
abused and ignored.
It is not just about the tourism in-
dustry that could crumble and threat-
en the local economies that depend on
it.
It isn’t even just about the health of
our environment, our air, our water,
and our children.
It is about the choices that we make
and the priorities that we share.
It is about finally choosing people
over profits.
It is about finally choosing the long-
term health of our planet and our chil-
dren over the short-term reward of
stripping our resources and leaving
devastation and destruction behind.
By passing the Grand Canyon Cen-
tennial Protection Act, we will show
the people of Arizona, and countless
other Americans who have been side-
lined by powerful special interests,
that they are still heard, that they are
still seen, and that they will not be dis-
missed by their government.
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, once again, the gen-
tleman made my point perfectly for
me: This is about people.
There is mitigation. We are holding
people accountable. They are empow-
ered because now we are controlling
the energy cycle. We are not inden-
tured to another country like China or
Russia.

We are looking at the long series,

STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
H.R. 1373—GRAND CANYON CENTENNIAL PROTEC-
TION ACT—REP. GRIJALVA, D–AZ, AND 122 CO-
SPONSORS
The Administration strongly opposes H.R.
1373, the Grand Canyon Centennial Protec-
tion Act. This bill would permanently make
more than 1 million acres of Federal lands in
Arizona off limits to development and uses
that would otherwise be permissible under
Federal laws governing public lands, mining,
mineral, and geothermal leasing. The Ad-
ministration opposes such a large, perma-
nent withdrawal, which would prohibit envi-
ronmentally responsible development, as de-
termined through site-specific analysis, of
uranium and other mineral resources.
The United States has an extraordinary
abundance of mineral resources, both on-
shore and offshore, but this legislation would
restrict our ability to access critical min-
erals like uranium in an area known to have
them in large supply. Moreover, the size of
the withdrawal included in H.R. 1373 is in-
consistent with the Administration’s goal of
striking the appropriate balance for use of
public lands described in two executive or-
ders. This withdrawal would conflict with
the objectives set forth in Executive Order
13783, Promoting Energy Independence and
Economic Growth, and Executive Order
13817, A Federal Strategy to Ensure Secure
and Reliable Supplies of Critical Minerals.
Development of our Nation’s mineral re-
sources is essential to ensuring the Nation’s
geopolitical security, and this bill would not
help us achieve that goal.
If H.R. 1373 were presented to the Presi-
dent, his advisors would recommend that he
veto it.
URANIUM PRODUCERS OF AMERICA,
Santa Fe, New Mexico, October 28, 2019.
Hon. RAUL GRIJALVA,
Chairman, House Natural Resources Committee,
Washington, DC.
Hon. ROB BISHOP,
Ranking Member, House Natural Resources
Committee, Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN GRIJALVA AND RANKING
MEMBER BISHOP: On behalf of the Uranium
Producers of America (UPA), I write to ex-
press our strong opposition to H.R. 1373, the
Grand Canyon Centennial Protection Act.
The permanent mineral withdrawal imposed
by H.R. 1373 unnecessarily eliminates access
to significant known deposits of uranium,
rare earth elements, and other critical min-
erals.
UPA is a national trade association rep-
resenting the domestic uranium mining and
conversion industries. UPA members con-
duct uranium exploration, development, and
mining operations in Arizona, Colorado, Ne-
braska, New Mexico, South Dakota, Texas,
Utah, and Wyoming. UPA members operate
valuable, high-grade uranium deposits that
provide quality, high-paying jobs, tax reve-
nues, and produce clean energy for the citi-
zens of the United States. UPA’s mission is
to promote the viability of the nation’s ura-
nium industry, while being good stewards of
the environments in which we work and live.
H.R. 1373’s permanent withdrawal of over
one million acres of federal land from min-
eral development ignores the comprehensive
suite of federal, state, and local environ-
mental regulations that apply to the mining
process, from exploration and production to
reclamation and closure. H.R. 1373 disregards
the well-documented success of mine rec-
lamation in the withdrawal area and the fact
that all federal lands within Grand Canyon
National Park were already withdrawn from
the Mining Law when the park was created.
Moreover, the U.S. Geological Survey esti-
mates that there are significant undis-
covered uranium resources in the withdrawal
area, but the mineral assessment required as
part of the current moratorium has not yet
begun. This means H.R. 1373 would perma-
nently strand resources without an informed
understanding of the economic value of the
deposits and the national security impact of
their permanent withdrawal.
Ensuring responsible access to uranium de-
posits on federal land is a crucial component
of ensuring the long-term viability of the do-
mestic uranium industry, the survival of
which is vital to energy and national secu-
rity. Despite the existence of vast deposits,
domestic producers forecast 2019 production
to plummet below one percent of what is re-
quired to power our commercial nuclear re-
actors, which is not enough uranium to
power even one of our nation’s 98 reactors.
These reactors produce approximately 20 per-
cent of the electricity for the U.S. power
grid, representing the world’s largest com-
mercial nuclear fleet and supplying more
than half of the carbon-free power in the
United States. In addition, international
agreements require domestically-sourced
uranium to meet our defense requirements,
including our nuclear weapons and the nu-
clear-powered Navy.
H.R. 1373 is particularly objectionable at a
time the United States is at risk of losing its
domestic uranium industry and becoming
completely reliant on imported uranium.
Uranium imports from state-backed entities
have created an uneven global playing field
on which market-driven uranium companies
in the United States are unable to compete.
An increasing share of uranium imports into
the United States are coming from govern-
ment or state-controlled entities located in
nations that are not aligned with U.S. inter-
ests. While free market companies are forced
to adapt to market conditions, state-backed
entities within the Russian sphere of influ-
ence (RSOI) have ignored the market, in-
creased their total supply, and added further
downward pressure to prices. U.S. uranium
companies are not competing with free mar-
ket companies in the RSOI; they are com-
peting with governments more concerned
about increasing market share, and geo-
political advantage, than profitability.
We urge you to vote against H.R. 1373 and
instead prioritize policies to revive and ex-
pand domestic uranium mining, nuclear fuel
production and the provision of clean energy
in the United States.
Sincerely,
JON J. INDALL,
Counsel for UPA.

US NEEDS ALTERNATIVES TO CHINA’S RARE
EARTH MONOPOLY
(By James Gorrie)
As the trade war goes on, China threatens
to deprive the US of critical elements its
economy and its military can’t do without.
Many consider China’s vast portfolio of
U.S. Treasuries as their not-so-secret weapon
in the ongoing trade war. And it some ways.
that is certainly true. China could decide to
liquidate much or all of its U.S. bond hold-
ings in response to rising tariff, and use
other tactics. like currency devaluation.
But such a move would damage their econ-
omy along with America’s. The Chinese are
smarter than that.
CHINA STATE MEDIA HINTS AT EMBARGO
Besides. the Chinese Communist Party
(CCP) has another. more tangible ace up its
sleeve. As unbelievable as it sounds. China
holds a near global monopoly on the supply—
or more accurately. the processing capac-
ity—of rare earth elements (REE).
Should China decide to impose an embargo
against the sale of REEs to the United
States, the American economy and the U.S.
military would be scrambling to replace
them, at least in the short run. That’s not
overstating this situation, by the way. As
Foreign Policy magazine recently observed.
‘‘Beijing could slam every comer of the
American economy. from oil refineries to
wind turbines to jet engines. by banning ex-
ports of crucial minerals.’’ The list of REE-
critical products includes smartphones. spe-
cial alloys. navigation systems, and much
more. China, of course. is well aware of this.
In fact. China’s state-run media have been
promoting an embargo, or leveraging the
threat of one. in response to the U.S. tariffs
on Chinese products. and specifically.
against the U.S. blacklisting of Huawei. Chi-
na’s biggest telecom equipment manufac-
turer and a leader in 5G networks. Since all
media in China is controlled by the Chinese
Communist Party (CCP). it’s a certainty
that this message is being sent to U.S. trade
negotiators directly from the CCP.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8615
October 30, 2019
CHINA MADE THIS PLAY BEFORE
If China docs stop selling REEs to the
United States. it wouldn’t be the first time
they’ve played that card. In 2006. China
began limiting its exports of REEs. reducing
them by 40 percent until 2010. The reduction
caused the prices of non-China-sourced REEs
to skyrocket. China also took advantage of
its market dominance and stopped selling to
Japan in retribution for a maritime incident.
After the United States. along with Japan
and Europe. prevailed against China in a
WTO fight in 2015. China dramatically
dropped its REE prices and drove the only
active REE processing plant in the United
States, Molycorp, into bankruptcy. At that
time China produced 95 percent of the
world’s rare earth metals.
HOW DID WE GET HERE?
But how has the U.S. allowed itself to be
put in such bind? Wouldn’t it make sense to
have secured an American or at least a
friendly source of these REEs on which so
much of our military preparedness and our
economy are reliant? Shouldn’t that have
been a priority, say, decades ago?
Actually. it was. But that changed in 1980.
when rare earth mineral mining and proc-
essing came under the purview of the Nu-
clear Regulatory Commission and the Inter-
national Atomic Energy Agency. Regulatory
guidelines became increasingly restrictive,
driving up costs, steadily decreasing U.S.
producers’ competitiveness. By the mid-
1990s, the U.S. was no longer producing
REEs.
RARE EARTH ELEMENTS AREN’T SO RARE AFTER
ALL
Fortunately, REEs aren’t rare at all. In
fact, they’re actually quite plentiful around
the world, even in the United States. The 17
elements that are categorized as REEs have
magnetic and conductive aspects and are
typically unearthed as a result of mining op-
erations. but most are present in only small
amounts. There are few, if any. specific ‘‘rare
earth mines.’’ The costs and health risks of
producing REEs are in the processing. For
instance. since toxins and radiation are a by-
product of processing REEs. many Western
nations’ environmental and labor laws make
processing them both costly and a health
risk to miners. It has been easier much
cheaper for other nations to let China
produce them, since neither health codes nor
environmental standards are significant fac-
tors there.
AN REE SHORTAGE CRISIS?
But the costs of allowing China to gain the
upper hand in the world’s supply of REEs are
now becoming clear. If China does in fact re-
strict REE sales to the United States in the
near future. it would certainly impact both
the consumer product markets and the mili-
tary.
The key question is, how long it would
take to bridge the supply gap and find alter-
natives? One mitigating factor is Australian-
based Lynas. the world’s only major rare-
earth producer outside of China. It has
partnered with Texas-based Blue Line to es-
tablish U.S. operations by 2021. However, the
United States still lacks any REE processing
capacity, representing a critical and ongoing
vulnerability in its military capabilities.
But the news isn’t all bad. The Mountain
Pass mine in California is currently being
prepared to ramp up REE processing oper-
ations by 2020. Coincidentally. Mountain
Pass was previously owned by Molycorp,
which had invested over $1.5 billion in the
processing project. before being forced out of
business by China in 2015. The critical role
that REEs play in both military and con-
sumer products is impossible to overstate.
The U.S. economy is dependent upon a
steady and dependable supply. If America is
to be successful in its bid to roll back Chi-
na’s power and influence over the rest of the
world. ensuring its own supply of strategic
REE is not just an option. it’s a necessity.
Mr. GOSAR. Once again, let’s go
back. Let’s look at the geology. The
geology tells us everything that we
need to know.
We need to understand the minerals.
The minerals are water soluble. These
are condensed pipes, vertically. What is
happening is that, as water runs—and
this is a lot of sedimentary rock. That
is why the Grand Canyon is so deep.
When it runs over these breccia
pipes, like we have talked about, they
are exposed naturally. Prior to that,
they are covered with what they call a
sulfite cap. But once they are ex-
posed—and you can see this under the
Grand Canyon experience—you walk
over these breccia pipes. You walk over
them. They are exposed naturally.
Don’t you think it is wise to remove
these? It is a good concentration. It
keeps the supply chain in.
And if you get rid of our only mining
uranium concentrator, it doesn’t come
back. It won’t come back. And then
you sold your soul to China and you
sold your soul to Russia, because they
own the monopoly.
b 1315
That is what is wrong here.
Last, but not least, we also have to
make sure that multiple-use is put
down forward. We are stewards of
that—we, as Congress.
Public lands were taken aside by the
Federal Government from the States in
a joint tenancy, that they would be
vested properly for the best use, the
best investment, and the best return.
The last time I have been watching, we
have been actually denigrating that.
When is enough enough? Arizona has
more national monuments than any
other State in the country.
Congress then told the people that we
will give payment in lieu of taxes. We
have had to beg for every penny that
we get. That is wrong. This contract is
about, yes, you can do all this. You can
clean up mine sites that were left be-
fore.
And don’t get me started on the Ben-
nett Freeze, by the way. The Federal
Government put an arbitrary line, that
you can’t do anything under that Ben-
nett Freeze line. Wow, that is wonder-
ful. Thank the Federal Government for
that. That is amazing, and particularly
a lot of the mine shafts that have been
exposed from that very era.
Once again, this is about common
sense, facts. We have disputed every-
thing that they have talked about.
This is a natural formation. It is mil-
lions upon millions upon millions of
years old. As that water runs down, as
that air runs down, we contaminate it
with low levels of uranium. Wouldn’t it
be better if we actually got rid of that
and actually got better and more clean
water, clean of uranium and arsenic?
That is an important process here.
That is where we are actually helping
people out. People benefit from it.
Once again, here is a breccia pipe ex-
posed, not by man but by nature. You
are walking all over it.
Once again, you see this alluvial fan
where water runs. What do you think it
is running over? What do you think it
is dripping down through? What do you
think is dissolving in there?
Madam Chair, this isn’t rocket
science, but it is not an emotional one
either. It is an articulated, scientific
argument.
Once again, the mitigation, I could
take somebody up here and nobody
could find this mine site now. This is
after immediate resolution on it. But
what is different about this than 80
years ago is that we are holding people
accountable. The government failed at
that before. We have seen this type of
mitigation over and over again.
In the Resolution Copper mine down
in southern Arizona, we have seen an
investment of almost $1 billion by the
mining company to mitigate a pre-
viously mined area. It is beautiful. It is
absolutely beautiful. I want people to
go see it. I want them to try the water.
It is pristine. It is cleaner than they
found it.
That is good stewardship. That is uti-
lizing the things that were given to us
to make this country and technology
grow. That is the opportunity that we
have.
Arbitrarily just taking things off
back and forth, that is not the right
way to go.
Talking about the indigenous people
there, well, it is sad when we use them
as pawns, when we have a press con-
ference and they don’t even know what
they are coming to the press con-
ference for. That is sad.
America needs to wake up. This has
nothing to do with the Grand Canyon.
This has everything to do with monop-
olization and removing part of the seg-
ment that we promised future genera-
tions for that investment. That is what
we have done. That is what the other
side wants to do.
There is a way forward, responsibly,
clean, and proper.
Madam Chair, I would like to have
all of my colleagues vote against this
measure. Once again, the President
issued a SAP that he will not sign the
bill, and it will die in the Senate.
Once again, this is a messaging bill.
It is sad that we are bombarding every-
one with bad facts. Spend time looking
at the facts. Geology, the rocks, set
you free. I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Since we are engaging in a little bit
of a geology course, I would like to
point out, at the Kanab North Uranium
Mine that has already been closed,
within 400 feet of the mine site where
the fence is, after 20 years, levels are as
high as 10 times above the naturally
occurring level for uranium concentra-
tion. This has been open and exposed
for 20 years. The mine ceased oper-
ations in the 1990s.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8616 October 30, 2019
I use that to say that, as far as I un-
derstand, the House of Representatives
is a national legislature, and as a na-
tional legislature, we have responsibil-
ities to deal with issues, regardless of
whether it is in my particular district
or in my colleague, Mr. GOSAR’s par-
ticular district.
Over the course of the last couple of
days, we have heard our Republican
colleagues call this bill a number of
things: a tired, old retread; a national
security threat; a Federal land grab; an
attack on science; and even an idle
waste of time. I want to assure this
Chamber and the American people that
protecting the Grand Canyon is none of
these characterizations.
The truth is, this bill is a critical
safeguard for the Grand Canyon, one of
the most iconic landscapes in the
world, and the vital Colorado River wa-
tershed that supplies drinking water
for communities throughout the
Southwest.
Forty million people depend on that
source. We just passed, overwhelm-
ingly, the drought contingency plan for
five States, including Arizona, because
of the imminent threat of drought and
the need to protect that river and that
water source.
Most importantly, this bill is in re-
sponse to Tribal communities that
have experienced firsthand the toxic
legacy of uranium mining. When I first
got involved in this effort over a dec-
ade ago, it was not because of narrow
special interests. It was because the
Navajo Nation, the Havasupai Tribe,
the Hualapai Tribe, the Hopi Tribe, and
other impacted communities were call-
ing for an end to the contamination as-
sociated with uranium mining.
These communities have lived on the
land since time immemorial. Their in-
terests go beyond the handful of jobs
associated with the boom and bust
cycle of the mining industry.
Historically, Tribal communities in
the Southwest have borne the brunt of
uranium mining’s impact, with some
estimates placing over 1,000 abandoned
uranium mines and four mills on the
Navajo Nation alone.
In 2008, health officials discovered
that nearly 30 water sources in the
Navajo Nation contained unsafe levels
of uranium, and 27 percent of the resi-
dents tested positive for high levels of
uranium.
The Navajos are not alone. In fact,
the Havasupai, who live in the Grand
Canyon and depend on the aquifer be-
neath the Colorado Plateau, are deal-
ing with contaminated groundwater as-
sociated with the active discharge by
the Canyon Mine. This is why several
Havasupai Tribal leaders and members
traveled to Washington, D.C., to be
present for this vote.
This bill is about protecting these
communities. It is about providing
lasting protection for a sacred land-
scape.
The consequences of uranium mining
are not some imagined or unproven
threat. We are forcing communities to
contemplate the viability of their an-
cestral homes.
The United States has an obligation
to protect Tribal communities and en-
sure that they prosper. We have a
moral obligation to protect our most
sacred and treasured public lands. We
shouldn’t need a treaty to remind us to
do the right thing.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to stand with the Havasupai and other
affiliated Tribes to protect the Grand
Canyon for future generations.
A ‘‘yes’’ vote today on the Grand
Canyon Centennial Protection Act is,
overall, a declaration that there are
places and communities in which ex-
traction and destruction of a land-
scape, and jeopardizing people’s health

vancement, that those places should be
left alone.
The Grand Canyon should be left

It is titled ‘‘Why I Changed My Mind About
Nuclear Power.’’
It details very clearly and wisely why nuclear
power and its supply chains are very impor-

WHY I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT NUCLEAR
POWER: TRANSCRIPT OF MICHAEL
SHELLENBERGER’S TEDX BERLIN 2017—NO-
VEMBER 21, 2017
(By Michael Shellenberger)
Like a lot of kids born in the early 1970s,
I had the good fortune to be raised by hip-
pies. One of my childhood heroes was Stew-
art Brand. Stewart is not only one of the
original hippies, he’s also one of the first
modern environmentalists of the 1960s and
70s. As a young boy, one of my favorite
memories is playing cooperative games that
Stewart Brand invented as an antidote to
the Vietnam War.
I’m from a long line of Christian Pacifists
known as Mennonites. Every August, as kids,
we would remember the US government’s
atomic bombing of Japan by lighting candles
and sending them on paper boats at Bitter-
sweet Park.
After high school, throughout college, and
afterwards, I brought delegations of people
to Central America to promote diplomacy
and peace and to support local farmer co-
operatives in Guatemala and Nicaragua.
Over time, as I’ve travelled around the
world and visited small farming commu-
nities on every continent, I’ve come to ap-
preciate that most young people don’t want
to be stuck in the village. They don’t want
to spend their whole lives chopping and haul-
ing wood. They want to go to the city for op-
portunity—at least most of them them do—
for education and for work.
What I’ve realized is that process of urban-
ization of moving to the city is actually very
positive for nature. It allows the natural en-
vironment to come back. It allows for the
central African Mountain Gorilla, an impor-
tant endangered species, to have the habitat
they need to survive and thrive.
In that process you have to go vertical,
and so even in places like Hong Kong you
can see that with tall buildings they can
spare the natural environment around the
city.
Of course, it takes a huge amount of en-
ergy to go up, and so the big question of our
time is how do you get plentiful, reliable
electricity without destroying the climate?
I started out as an anti-nuclear activist
and I quickly got involved in advocating for
renewable energy. In the early part of this
century I helped to start a labor union and
environmentalist alliance called the Apollo
Alliance and we pushed for a big investment
in clean energy: solar, wind, electric cars.
The investment idea was eventually picked
up by President Obama, and during his time
in office we invested about $150 billion to
make solar, wind and electric cars much
cheaper than they were.
We seemed to be having a lot of success but
we were starting to have some challenges.
Some of them you’re familiar with. Solar
and wind generate electricity in Germany
just 10 to 30 percent of the time, and so we’re
dependent on the weather for electricity.
There were other problems we were notic-
ing, though. Sometimes these energy sources
generate too much power and while you hear
a lot of hype about batteries we don’t have
sufficient storage even in California, where
we have a lot of investment and a lot of Sil-
icon Valley types putting a lot of investment
in battery and other storage technologies.
While we were struggling with these prob-
lems, Stewart Brand came out in 2005 and
said we should rethink nuclear power. This
was a shock to the system for me and my
friends. Stewart was one of the first big ad-
vocates of solar energy anywhere during the
early 1970s. He advised Governor Jerry
Brown of California.
But he said, look, we’ve been trying to do
solar for a long time and yet we get less than
a half of a percent of our electricity globally
from solar, about two percent from wind, and
the majority of our clean energy comes from
nuclear and hydro.
And according to the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change, nuclear produces
four times less carbon emissions than solar
does. That’s why they recommended in their
recent report the more intensive use of re-
newables, nuclear and carbon capture and
storage.
Let’s take a closer look at Germany. Ger-
many gets the majority of its electricity and
all of its transportation fuels from fossil
fuels. Last year Germany got 40 percent of
its electricity from coal, 13 percent from nu-
clear, 12 percent from natural gas, 12 percent
from wind, and six percent from solar.
Keep in mind that you don’t just have to
go from 18 percent solar and wind to 100 per-
cent solar and wind. To replace the entire
transportation sector with electric cars
you’d need to go from 18 percent renewables
to something like 150 percent. Germany’s
done a lot to invest in renewables and inno-
vate with solar and wind, but that’s a pretty
steep climb—even before you get to the ques-
tion of storage.
Let’s look at last year, Germany installed
four percent more solar panels but generated
three percent less electricity from solar.
Even when I’m in meetings with energy ex-
perts and I ask people if they can make a
guess as to why they think that is, and you’d
be shocked by how many energy experts have
no idea.
The reason is just that it wasn’t very
sunny last year in Germany.
Well, that probably meant that it was
windier, right? Because if it’s not as sunny
then maybe there’s more wind and those
things can balance each other out?
In truth, Germany installed 11 percent
more wind turbines in 2016 but got two per-
cent less of its electricity from wind. Same
story. Just not very windy.
So then you might think, ‘‘Well, we just
need to do a lot of solar and wind so that

when there’s not a lot of sunlight or wind we
can get more electricity from those energy
sources.’’
That’s what Germany is trying to do. Its
plan is to increase the amount of electricity
it gets from solar by 50 percent by 2030,
which would take you from 40 to 60
gigawatts.
But if you have a year like 2016, you’ll still
only be getting nine percent of your total
electricity from solar. And this is the biggest
solar country in the world. Germany is the
powerhouse of renewables.
The obvious response is we’ll just put it all
in batteries. We hear so much talk about
batteries. You would think that we just have
a huge amount of storage.
Environmental Progress took a look at our
home state of California and we discovered
that we have just 23 minutes of storage for
the grid—and to get that 23 minutes you’d
have to use every battery in every car and
truck in the state. (Which, as you can imag-
ine, is not super practical if you’re trying to
get somewhere. And Germany might be a lit-
tle different but not very different from Cali-
fornia.)
Most people are aware that to make this
transition to renewables, Germany has been
spending a lot more on electricity. And Ger-
man electricity prices rose about 50 percent
over the last 10 years. Today, German elec-
tricity is about two times more expensive
than electricity is in France.
You might think, look, that’s a small price
to pay to deal with climate change. And I
would agree with that. Paying a bit more for
energy—at least for those of us in the rich
world—is a decent thing to do to avert the
risk of catastrophic global warming.
But when you compare French and German
electricity, France gets 93 percent of its elec-
tricity from clean energy sources, mostly
hydro and nuclear while Germany gets just
46 percent, or about half as much clean en-
ergy.
Here’s the shocking thing: German carbon
emissions have gone up since 2009, and up
over the last two years, and may go up again
this year. And while German emissions have
gone down since the 1990s, most of that is be-
cause, after reunification, Germany closed
the inefficient coal plants from East Ger-
many. Most of its emissions reductions are
just due to that.
Let’s look at last year. One of the ways
you can reduce emissions quickly is by
switching from coal to natural gas, which
produces about half as much emissions. Coal
to gas switching would have resulted in
lower emissions except for the fact that Ger-
many took nuclear reactors off-line. And
when it did that, emissions went up again.
There’s still question about the future: if
we do a lot of solar and wind, won’t it all
work itself out?
One of the biggest challenges to solar and
wind has come from somebody in Germany
who is not a pro-nuclear person at all. He’s
an energy analyst and economist named
Leon Hirth. What he finds is that the prob-
lem I described earlier—where you have too
much solar or wind and you don’t know what
to do with it—reduces their economic value.
The value of wind drops 40 percent once it
becomes 30 percent of your electricity, Hirth
finds, and the value of solar drops by half
when it gets to just 15 percent.
One of the things you hear is that we can
do a solar roof fast—just one day to put up
the thing—whereas it takes five or ten years
to build a nuclear plant. And so people think
that if we do solar and wind we can go a lot
faster.
But the speed of deployment was the sub-
ject of an important article in the journal
Science last year, which was coauthored by
the climate scientist James Hansen. They
found that even when you combine solar and
wind you just get a lot less energy than when
you do nuclear. That goes for Germany as
well as the United States. They just com-
pared ten years of deployment for the two
technologies and it’s a stark comparison.
Well, I can tell what you’re thinking, be-
cause it’s what I was thinking: it sounds like
I might need to rethink my views of nuclear
power. But what about Chernobyl? What
about Fukushima? What about all the nu-
clear waste? Those are really reasonable
questions to ask.
When I was starting to ask them, there
were other people who were starting to
change their minds. One of the ones I was
most impressed by, and who was very influ-
ential, was George Monbiot.
Monbiot wrote a column shortly after
Fukushima where he went through the sci-
entific research on radiation and concluded,
‘‘The anti-nuclear movement to which I once
belonged has misled the world about the im-
pacts of radiation on human health.’’
I write some pretty harsh things some-
times, but this was a pretty strong column.
He was talking to a lot of scientists who
study radiation.
One top British scientist who studies radi-
ation is Gerry Thomas. She started some-
thing called the Chernobyl Tissue Bank out
of her concern for the accident. She’s a to-
tally independent professor of pathology at
Imperial College in London.
I called her and said, ‘‘I’d like to present
on the science of radiation but I’m not a ra-
diation scientist, so can I just steal your
slides? If you let me, I’ll put your picture on
them.’’
The first thing she points out is that most
ionizing radiation—that’s the kind of radi-
ation that is potentially harmful that comes
from a nuclear accident—is natural.
I was like, ‘‘That sounds alright. I like nat-
ural foods. Natural radiation from hot
springs.’’
Gerry said, ‘‘No, actually, natural radi-
ation is just as potentially harmful as artifi-
cial radiation.’’
What’s striking is that the total amount of
ionizing radiation we’re exposed not just
from Chernobyl and Fukushima but all of
the atomic bomb testing in the sixties and
70s totals just 0.3 percent. Most of the radi-
ation we’re exposed to comes from the earth,
the atmosphere, and the buildings around us.
Let’s look at the big one: Chernobyl. This
was the event that led me to be anti-nuclear
and become an anti-nuclear activist.
The United Nations has overseen these
very large research efforts involving hun-
dreds of scientists around the world who do
this research. So the possibility of somebody
fudging the data or covering something up is
pretty low in that environment, because
there are so many credible scientists at dif-
ferent universities doing the research.
This was a pivotal moment for me.
Chernobyl is the worst nuclear accident
we’ve ever had. Some people say it’s the
worst accident we’ll ever have. I don’t need
to make a statement that strong. But they
literally had a nuclear reactor without a
containment dome and it was on fire. It was
just raining radiation down on everybody. It
was a terrible accident.
But when they start counting bodies, what
they come up with is 28 deaths from acute
radiation syndrome, 15 deaths from thyroid
cancer over the last 25 years. As horrible as
it sounds, thyroid cancer is the best cancer
to get because hardly anybody dies from it.
It’s highly treatable. You can have a surgery
to remove the thyroid gland and take
thyroxine, which is a synthetic substitute.
In fact, most of the people who died were in
remote rural areas where they couldn’t get
the treatment they needed.
If you take the 16,000 people who got thy-
roid cancer from Chernobyl, they estimate
160 of them will die from it. And it’s not like
they’re dying of it right away. They’ll die
from it in old age. That’s not to say it’s
okay, but it’s to put it in some context.
And there’s no evidence of any increase in
thyroid cancer outside of the three nations
most affected, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.
There’s no evidence of an effect by
Chernobyl on fertility, birth malformations,
or infant mortality; nor for causing an in-
crease in adverse pregnancy outcomes or
still births; nor for any genetic effects.
I think this last one is the most striking
thing: there’s no evidence of any increase in
nonthyroid cancer including among the co-
hort who put out the Chernobyl fire and
cleaned it up afterwards.
I’m still surprised by this finding, and so I
put the link to the web site on that slide, be-
cause I don’t think you should take my word
for it. Reading about Chernobyl was, for me,
a big part of changing my mind.
What about Fukushima? It was the second
worst nuclear disaster in history and a lot
smaller than Chernobyl. There have been no
deaths from radiation exposure, which is
pretty amazing. Meanwhile, 1,500 people died
being pulled out of nursing homes, hos-
pitals—it was insane. It was a panic. The
Japanese government shouldn’t have done
that. It violated every standard of what
you’re supposed to do an accident. You’re
supposed to shelter-in-place. In fact, by pull-
ing people out of their homes and moving
them around outside they actually exposed
more people to more radiation.
And you have to put that in comparison of
the other things that were going on, like the
15,000 to 20,000 dying instantly from drown-
ing—pinned down by many different tech-
nologies, by the way—from that tsunami.
So while there was no increase in thyroid
cancer, there was the stress and fear from
believing you were contaminated despite the
evidence showing that that wasn’t the case
at all.
Some scientists did an interesting study.
They took a bunch of school children from
France to Fukushima and had them wear
dosimeters, which is what we call geiger
counters now.
You can see here that when those kids go
through the airport security system their ra-
diation exposures spiked. When they flew
from Paris to Tokyo on the airplane their ra-
diation exposures spiked. They went through
the French embassy’s security system their
radiation exposures spiked.
When they went to the city of Tomioka,
which received a lot of radiation from the
accident, it was just a tiny blip compared to
the security systems.
Let’s put this in an even larger context. If
you live in a big city like London, Berlin, or
New York, you increase your mortality risk
by 2.8 percent, just from air pollution alone.
If you live with someone who smokes ciga-
rettes your mortality risk increases 1.7 per-
cent.
But if you were someone who cleaned up
Chernobyl, your mortality risk increased
just one percent. That’s just because there
wasn’t as much radiation exposure as people
thought.
I’m from the state of Colorado in the
United States where we have an annual expo-
sure to radiation about the same as what
people who live around Chernobyl get.
This is really basic science and is right
there on their web site but nobody knows it.
Only eight percent of Russians surveyed ac-
curately predicted the death toll from
Chernobyl, and zero percent accurately pre-
dicted the death toll from Fukushima.
Meanwhile, there are seven million pre-
mature deaths per year from air pollution

and the evidence against particulate matter
only gets stronger. That’s why every major
journal that looks at it concludes that nu-
clear is the safest way to make reliable elec-
tricity.
All of this leads to an uncomfortable con-
clusion—one that the climate scientist
James Hansen came to recently: nuclear
power has actually saved 1.8 million lives.
That’s not something you hear very much
about.
What about the waste? This is the waste
from a nuclear plant in the United States.
The thing about nuclear waste is that it’s
the only waste from electricity production
that is safely contained anywhere. All of the
other waste for electricity goes into the en-
vironment including from coal, natural gas
and—here’s another uncomfortable conclu-
sion—solar panels.
There’s no plan to recycle solar panels out-
side of the EU. That means that all of our
solar in California will join the waste
stream. And that waste contains heavy toxic
metals like chromium, cadmium, and lead.
So how much toxic solar waste is there?
Well, to get a sense for that, look at how
much more materials are required to
produce energy from solar and wind com-
pared to nuclear. As a result, solar actually
produces 200 to 300 times more toxic waste
than nuclear.
What about weapons? If there were any
chance that more nuclear energy increased
the risk of nuclear war, I would be against it.
I believe that diplomacy is almost always
the right solution.
People say what about North Korea? Korea
proves the point. In order to get nuclear
power—and it’s been this way for 50 years—
you have to agree not to get a weapon.
That’s the deal.
South Korea wanted nuclear power. They
agreed not to get a weapon. They don’t have
a weapon.
North Korea wanted nuclear power. I think
they should have gotten it. We didn’t let
them have it, for a variety of reasons. They
got a bomb. They are testing missiles that
can hit Japan and soon will be able to hit
California.
So if you’re looking for evidence that nu-
clear energy leads to bombs you can’t find it
in Korea or anywhere else.
Where does that leave us? With some more
uncomfortable facts. Like if Germany hadn’t
closed its nuclear plants, it’s emissions
would be 43 percent lower than they are
today. And if you care about climate change,
that’s something you at least have to wres-
tle with—especially in light of the facts I’ve
presented on the health impacts of different
energy sources.
I’d like to close with a quote from some-
body else who changed his mind about nu-
clear power, and somebody else who was a
huge childhood hero for me, and that’s Sting:
‘‘If we’re going to tackle global warming, nu-
clear power is the only way to generate mas-
sive amounts of power.’’
Thank you for listening.

The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 1 printed in
part C of House Report 116–264.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise as
the designee of the gentlewoman from
Arizona (Mrs. LESKO), and I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of the bill, insert the following:
SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act shall not be effective until the
Secretary of the Interior, in consultation
with the Secretary of Labor, finds that the
withdrawal under section 2 will not ad-
versely affect jobs available to Native Amer-
icans, other minorities, and women.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 656, the gentleman
from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Arizona.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, my
amendment states that this act shall
not become effective until the Sec-
retary of the Interior, in consultation
with the Secretary of Labor, finds that
the withdrawal will not adversely af-
fect jobs available to Native Ameri-
cans, other minorities, and women.
I believe deeply in protecting the en-
vironment for my grandchildren, but I
also believe in protecting the potential
employment opportunities of Arizo-
nans, especially those in underserved
communities. Resource development
benefits the economies of local commu-
nities.

of jobs and $29 billion in economic ac-
tivity.
We should not entertain any with-
drawal without confirmation that this
bill will not adversely affect jobs, par-
ticularly for Native Americans, mi-
norities, and women.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I rise
in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Arizona is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, this
amendment is not a good faith effort to
protect Native communities, minori-
ties, or women. It is simply a ‘‘gotcha’’
amendment intended to kill the bill.
It is truly insulting that our col-
leagues across the aisle would try and
use Native communities as pawns to
kill this proposal, knowing full well
that Native people have too often had
to bear the brunt of uranium’s toxic
impacts.
On the Navajo Nation, there are hun-
dreds of abandoned uranium mines
waiting to be cleaned up. These toxic
sites pollute water and damage public
health. A recent study found dozens of
contaminated water sources on the
Navajo Nation, and nearly one-quarter
of the residents had elevated uranium
levels in their health screenings.
The Havasupai fear this same danger
for their community. They live down-
stream of the Canyon Mine and of
other proposed mines, and they worry
that they, too, will be forced to bear
that toxic burden.
That is why the Havasupai, the Nav-
ajo Nation, the National Congress of
American Indians, and the Inter Tribal
Association of Arizona, along with
other regional Tribes, all support a per-
manent withdrawal.
These indigenous voices are not props
at a press conference. They are not
quaint or docile. They are smart and
passionate advocates for their people,
for the situation now, and, more impor-
tantly, for future generations to come.
They deserve our respect. Anything
less, I think, crosses a line.
Republicans aren’t lifting these Na-
tive voices. They are ignoring Native
voices and threatening the continued
health of Native communities to score
some cheap political points.
This amendment won’t help Native
communities. It will kill the very pro-
tections they are asking this Congress
to enact.
Mining is not, and will never again
be, the future of job creation in that
part of Arizona, and that is especially
true for women and minority commu-
nities.
During the extensive, multiyear
analysis and public comment process
that went into the original withdrawal,
the previous administration reviewed
job opportunities in the region. They
found that mining could likely support
295 direct jobs—295 jobs. This is in con-
trast to nearly 12,000 jobs directly sup-
ported by Grand Canyon National
Park, all of which rely on a healthy,
uranium-free Grand Canyon.
If we are serious about job growth in
this part of Arizona, we need to be
talking about how we can better sup-
port our outdoor recreation and tour-
ism economies. That would help all the
communities in the area.
Mining, in particular, is not a field
known for its diversity. In 2018, less
than 14 percent of all workers in min-
ing, quarrying, and extraction were
women, and less than 13 percent were
minorities.
Meanwhile, the outdoor rec industry
is making a major push to diversify,
developing outreach programs and
pipelines to bring people of color and
women into that space.
There really isn’t much of a compari-
son here.
Mr. Chairman, if you still aren’t sure
if this amendment was made in good
faith, I would point out the original
sponsor’s voting record.
The original sponsor voted against
the Violence Against Women Act, in
which an amendment therein contained
a particular focus on missing and mur-
dered indigenous women throughout
this country.
She voted against the Equality Act.
She voted against the Carcieri fix, one
of the most important votes in this
Chamber to protect Tribal sovereignty.
The Democratic Caucus has offered
numerous opportunities to champion
the causes of Native Americans,
women, and people of color. The origi-
nal sponsor and many of her colleagues
have declined those opportunities.
I am more than happy to work with
any of my colleagues to uplift tradi-
tionally underrepresented voices, but
this amendment is not a legitimate at-
tempt to do so. It is simply an attempt
to weaponize the communities that our
party has worked so hard to protect.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
vote ‘‘no’’ on the amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, through
the Chairman to the gentleman on the
other side, I would like to know if the
gentleman actually supports a mine in
Arizona.
That is a question.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, once
again, now we find out the true under-
standing of the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. GRIJALVA), that he doesn’t
approve of any mines whatsoever. And
why that is so important here is that
we talk about indigenous people and
empowerment. Well, let’s focus back on
this.
Recently, the Navajo Generating Sta-
tion, which was commissioned by Con-
gress to provide power for the water for
CAP that revolutionized Arizona for its
growth, the delivery of water, was all
given to the Tribes, the Navajo and
Hopi—not just the coal mine, but the
power plant as well. These were great-
paying jobs. They had benefits. It em-
powered the Native Americans.
Now, what is interesting about that
is that now we are shuttering this en-
terprise down. Eighty percent of the
Hopis’ operating budget per year is
going away; 60 percent of the Navajos’
operating budget is going away.
And, interestingly, what is our an-
swer from our colleagues on the other
side? Welfare.
Oh, my Lord, my God, I can’t believe
what I am hearing. Welfare, that is the
answer.
So let’s go back and have a little bit
of a geological conversation again, be-
cause rock sets you free.
Once again, these breccia pipes are
on this part of the Grand Canyon. This
is where everybody goes.
Look at these breccia pipes that are
exposed. They are water soluble. That
drains down. Gravity takes it down.
That is why you are getting that infil-
tration into the water.
I am not here to hurt anybody. I
refuse to do that. But I am not here to
turn my back on Native Americans
who are empowered instead of victim-
ized.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, this
amendment is a ‘‘gotcha’’ amendment.
The substance of the amendment is
misdirected, to say the least, and it ig-
nores history and ignores the reality
that we are in right now.
That reality is that, when I began to
get involved in this issue more than a
decade ago, it was in response to dis-
cussions that I had with the Havasupai
Tribe, with the Navajo Tribe, with the
Hopi Tribe, and with other indigenous
nations in and around the Grand Can-
yon. The consensus and the unity
around the issue that we have to pro-
tect the Grand Canyon was important,
not only for religious, cultural, and sa-
cred reasons, but also for the fact that
that is their home.
At the end of the day, the vote today
is a response to that work, to their ad-
vocacy, to their support, and to the
input that they had on the legislation.
It is a vote to affirm by this Congress
that, indeed, the concerns that they
raised are real and important.
Mr. Chair, I would urge a ‘‘no’’ vote
on the amendment, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, once
again, my points have been made.
This is a good amendment because
what it does is it looks at the overall
application to make sure that we are
not blindsiding our Native Americans.
There is hardly consensus whatso-
ever. We heard from numerous groups
over and over again that they do not
agree with this bill.
In fact, when the gentleman from Ar-
izona on the other side actually had a
press conference, they gathered lead-
ers, and the leaders had no idea what
they were there for the press con-
ference with.
Once again, as I asked previously
what mine would the gentleman from

Arizona on the other side actually en-
dorse, the answer was crickets.
That tells you who he is playing for.
It is not for Native Americans.
Maybe it is the Sierra Club. Maybe it
is The Wilderness Society. And I won-
der if they get any of their payments
from China and Russia. I wonder if
there is a collaboration here.

Once again this is a great amend-
ment. It talks about empowering peo-
ple with jobs, holding their dignity,
and directing the aspects of their life.
That is what is invigorating about
America. Victimization does none of
that.
I ask all my colleagues to vote for
this amendment, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I demand
a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-

the gentleman from Arizona will be

AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MR. GOSAR
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 2 printed in
part C of House Report 116–264.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of the bill, insert the following:
SEC. 3. APPLICATION.
The withdrawal under section 2 of this Act
shall not apply to any Federal land depicted
on the Map as ‘‘Federal Mineral Estate to be
Withdrawn’’ located in the 4th Congressional
District of Arizona, as configured on the date
of enactment of this Act.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 656, the gentleman
from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Arizona.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
What this amendment basically does
is, it takes my district out of this with-
drawal. Seventy percent of the active
mine sites and proposed mine sites are
in my district, and we want to make
sure that we are not victimized, that
we are taken out of this withdrawal
area.
This body actually had rules that
they tried to follow that they didn’t
usurp Members’ districts, they worked
with those Members’ districts. And
with that, I would ask that we endorse
that and withdraw my district from
this withdrawal.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I
claim the time in opposition to the
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Arizona is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I recognize there is some sensitivity,
or even a misunderstanding in this
Chamber to legislating in other Mem-
bers’ districts, but I would point out
that it is something we do almost
every day that we are here. We vote on
policies that impact the Nation, which
is why we are a national legislature.
I would also point out that the gen-
tleman from Arizona offered numerous
amendments to a bill in New Mexico,
the Chaco Canyon legislation, that will
be considered later today, and those
lands are certainly not in his district.
If each of us only ever legislated in
our own district, we would be doing a
disservice to the American people, but
we would never get anything done, as
well. Furthermore, every Member of
the Chamber has a responsibility to
support sovereign Tribal Nations who
have asked this body to protect the
Grand Canyon.
Serving the American people requires
that we take a national view into ac-
count. The lands protected in H.R. 1373
are public lands belonging to every
American. They protect an iconic
American landscape, the Grand Can-
yon, important to people across this
country. I can also easily think of 30
million Americans, most of whom are
outside the gentleman’s district, who
want to see the clean waters of the Col-
orado River protected.
The Colorado River provides drinking
water to Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas,
Los Angeles, and to countless cities
and towns across the west. It needs to
be protected from uranium mining. The
lands in the gentleman’s district were
not included in this bill arbitrarily.
They were added after an extensive
multiyear study and public process
that accounted for a long list of re-
gional factors before recommending
withdrawal.
The land in the gentleman’s district
is essential to protecting the Grand
Canyon and the Colorado River water-
shed from uranium’s toxic impacts.
We also need to consider the support
for this proposal on the ground. In a bi-
partisan poll, almost two-thirds of Ari-
zonans supported permanent protec-
tions for the lands around the Grand
Canyon, including those in the gentle-
man’s district.
Representative O’HALLERAN, who rep-
resents the vast majority of the lands
in this bill, is an original cosponsor
and a vocal supporter, because he
knows that this bill is important to all
his constituents. H.R. 1373 receives
vocal support from Tribal commu-
nities, including Havasupai, Navajo Na-
tion, Hopi Nation, the Hualapai, the
Inter Tribal Association of Arizona,
and the National Congress of American
Indians.
The bill receives support from
Coconino County and the city of Flag-
staff, who have a major stake in pro-
tecting the clean waters of the Grand
Canyon. H.R. 1373 is supported by
recreationalists, sportsmen, conserva-
tionists, and hundreds of local organi-
zations and individuals from Arizona
and across this Nation.
This bill is a broadly supported effort
to protect public lands that belong to
all Americans. The bill is an effort to
protect the Grand Canyon. A vocal mi-
nority of opponents who will never be
swayed should not stop the over-
whelming voice of the American peo-
ple.
Mr. Chairman, I encourage my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this amend-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Once again, I am sure glad that the
opposition actually brought that up
about New Mexico, because what we
are actually doing is, we are rep-
resenting the voices that didn’t get a
chance to speak out on behalf of their
claim, their allotments, but we will get
to that. And we will be showing you ex-
actly why we are doing that.
In my district, there are eight his-
toric mines included in this withdrawal
area. Six are in my district. Also in-
cluded in the withdrawal area is the
potential for 20 new mines that would
provide hundreds of high-paying jobs to
the local communities in Mohave
County north of Grand Canyon. Not
only am I opposed to the inclusion of
Mohave County in this bill, but so are
the Mohave County Board of Super-
visors, who unanimously voted to op-
pose this bill.
In addition to the board of super-
visors, local business organizations are
also opposed to this bill, including
Lake Havasu Area Chamber of Com-
merce, Arizona Rock Products Associa-
tion, Arizona Pork Producers Council,
plus many others.
I say to my colleagues, local resi-
dents and businesses in Mohave County
should have a say. They should not be
swayed.
Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD
the letter against this bill, H.R. 1373,
from the Mohave County Board of Su-
pervisors.
MOHAVE COUNTY RESOLUTION
NO. 2019–065
OPPOSING H.R. 1373 WHICH SEEKS TO MAKE
PERMANENT THE 2012 URANIUM MINING BAN
Whereas, Mohave County is located in
Northwestern Arizona and the Mohave Coun-
ty Board of Supervisors is committed to wise
stewardship and land conservation and con-
tinued recreational access for hunters, an-
glers, campers, and other recreationists, as
well as allowing for productive uses, includ-
ing agriculture, timber production, mining,
and energy and natural resource develop-
ment;
Whereas, on January 9, 2012, President
Barack Obama’s Interior Secretary, Ken
Salazar withdrew from mineral entry 1.07
million acres of subsurface estate in
Coconino and Mohave Counties, in northern
Arizona;

October 30, 2019
Whereas, one of the richest grades of ura-
nium ore in North America sits untouched in
the northern region of Mohave County due to
the 2012 withdrawal. The 375 million pounds
of uranium deposit in the area is the equiva-
lent of enough electricity generating capac-
ity for the entire state of California’s 40 mil-
lion people for 22.4 years;
Whereas, the affected area included in the
withdrawal was specifically left open for
multiple use as part of an open 1984 com-
promise agreement directed at the behest of
House Interior Committee Chairman Morris
Udall among environmental groups, the min-
ing industry, the livestock industry, both
states of Arizona and Utah and signed into
law by President Ronald Reagan;
Whereas, That compromise created 6 to 8
mile protective buffer zones around the
Grand Canyon National Park in the form of
300,000 acres of designated BLM and 800,000
acres of National Forest Wilderness areas
while releasing lands with high potential for
mineral extraction and livestock grazing and
recreational purposes;
Whereas, the uranium industry in the
southwest has historically been a major eco-
nomic driver for the region. Mohave County
and our neighboring State of Utah could see
major economic potential with the opening
of more uranium mining near the Arizona
Strip. Mining in the area can bring in over
$40 million annually in payroll, $9.5 million
in mining claim payments and fees to local
governments in Arizona and Utah, and over
$30 billion over a 42 year life span, helping to
finance local schools, roads, hospitals, and
other infrastructure;
Whereas, Congressman Raul Grijalva has
introduced H.R. 1373, titled the Grand Can-
yon Centennial Protection Act that aims to
make permanent the 2012 uranium mining
ban along with including a mining ban on
any land or interest in land acquired by the
United States after enactment of the bill;
Whereas, H.R. 1373 is very misguided with
its title. Since the 1984 Compromise there
has been no mining allowed within BLM Wil-
derness areas or within the Grand Canyon
National Park itself;
Whereas, the Government’s own Draft En-
vironmental Impact Statement stated that
there is no evidence to show that mining ac-
tivities outside the Grand Canyon National
Park pose a risk to areas within the Colo-
rado River drainage or inside the National
Park itself;
Whereas, Modern mining industry reclama-
tion techniques are vastly superior to those
used by the United States government dur-
ing the Cold War era uranium boom of the
1950 and 1960s, which did bring harm to Na-
tive American and local populations and are
demonstrably improved and safe;
Whereas, Arizona and neighboring Utah
have abundant in-ground uranium resources,
considerable existing uranium infrastruc-
ture, and large numbers of qualified workers
capable of supplying defense and energy
needs for decades to come;
Whereas, the permanent ban of uranium
mining in the Arizona Strip area would be
detrimental to our local economy and cause
severe economic harm to local communities
without promised economic benefits from
tourism; Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, by the Mohave County Board of
Supervisors that Mohave County strongly
opposes H.R 1373 and any attempt to make
permanent the 2012 Uranium Mining Ban in
the Arizona Strip area of Mohave County.
Adopted on this 17th day of June, 2019:
Mohave County Board of Supervisors: HILDY
ANGIUS,
Chairman.
ATTEST:
GINNY ANDERSON,
Clerk of the Board.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, let’s go back
through this. You know, we have heard
all about the health implications, but
rocks set you free.
Once again, we look at these breccia
pipes that are outlined in this yellow
and red. The red are the most con-
centrated parts of this. What ends up
happening is you see them dissolve in
water and in air.
And so when you look at the Grand
Canyon, you are seeing this seepage
that comes into the Grand Canyon wa-
tershed naturally. What we are actu-
ally doing is cleaning this up. Wouldn’t
that be amazing, amazing that we are
actually interceding on the best behav-
ior and the best acknowledgements of
the people around there? Amazing.
And I would hardly call this a prob-
lem. In fact, immediate restoration of
these lands is impeccable. Yes, we have
this negative connotation about what
the past has done. But this is where
history and our new technology actu-
ally intercede, where we are actually
intervening on this, making and im-
proving the landscape. That is amaz-
ing. That is absolutely amazing.
Once again, this is untouched. Man is
not here. This is what nature has done
to expose this. Once again, you have an
exposed breccia pipe. You have a ravine
that carries water that sheets off. Once
again, by taking that out, taking that
breccia pipe out, it facilitates perme-
ation down into lower aquifers replen-
ishing limited water supplies that we
actually have. It is amazing what the
rocks do. They set you free.
And my district has said, listen, ex-
clude us from this overreach by the
Federal Government. The Federal Gov-
ernment has hardly been a champion in
regard to Native Americans and people
in this area. We rule by fiat and scare
people.
Once again, this is a good bill. We
want to be excluded from this with-
drawal. I would hope that everybody
would listen to the people from my dis-
trict.
Mr. Chairman, I ask for everybody to
vote for this amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself the balance of my time in
opposition to the amendment.
As I said earlier, I think we keep for-
getting the essence of what we are
talking about here today. And the es-
sence is the Grand Canyon, something
that is recognized nationally, not only
as an environmental icon, but the de-
pendency that 40 million people have
on the water of the Grand Canyon. And
while we want to minimize this, the re-
ality is that the history tells us and
current health studies tell us of the im-
pact that Native communities have
suffered because of uranium contami-
nation in their water, in their air, and
in their land. Those are reasons enough
to put aside a very special place and
permanently ban uranium mining.
This amendment cuts an exception
based on territorial imperative or some
provincial thought that we are not all
part of one great Nation. This is a na-
tional issue and should be treated that
way.
Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on
the amendment, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR).

At the end of the bill, insert the following:
SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.
The withdrawal under section 2 of this Act
shall not go into effect until the Secretary of
the Interior completes a mineral survey of
the area proposed for withdrawal, including
uranium, rare earth elements, geothermal
and oil and gas resources, and determines
that there are no mineral resources, geo-
thermal resources, or critical minerals
present other than uranium.

from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Arizona.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
H.R. 1373 permanently bans oil, nat-
ural gas, geothermal, uranium, and
other critical minerals and rare earth
leasing and production on over a mil-
lion acres of land in Arizona. This com-
monsense amendment does not kill the
bill. It delays the effective date until
we have done adequate mapping and
surveying of the minerals and re-
sources in this area.
Specifically, the amendment allows
the bill to go into effect when the Sec-
retary of the Interior completes a min-
eral survey of the area proposed for
withdrawal including uranium, rare
earth elements, geothermal, and oil
and gas resources, and determines that
there are no mineral resources, geo-
thermal resources, or critical minerals
present, other than uranium.
The temporary political mineral
withdrawal imposed in 2012 by the
Obama administration that focused ex-
clusively on banning mining cost the
surrounding areas in Arizona and Utah
between two and 4,000 jobs and $29 bil-
lion in overall regional economic activ-
ity. The previous administration’s mis-
guided actions killed more than 7,000
hard-rock mining claims in the area
over a 3-year span.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8622 October 30, 2019
This legislation would expand the
withdrawal area and also expand the
mineral withdrawal in the withdrawal
area to include oil and gas leasing, geo-
thermal leasing, and other mineral de-
velopment in addition to mining.
Mr. Chairman, there are rare earths
and other valuable minerals, including
copper and uranium, in this area.
There is also a great amount of geo-
thermal potential. We should at least
know all the minerals and resources
potential in this million-acre area be-
fore we permanently lock it up. This
just requires mapping and surveying of
the targeted areas for the withdrawal.
Once again, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I
claim the time in opposition to the
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Arizona is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
b 1430
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, this
amendment would allow Secretary
Bernhardt to kill this proposal in pur-
suit of information we already have.
My colleagues across the aisle con-
tinually allude to the lack of informa-
tion we have about this region, the
lack of study, and the lack of science.
They seem to ignore the extensive,
multiyear study that preceded the cur-
rent withdrawal.
That study looked at local econo-
mies. It reviewed the best available
science. It took into account public
comments. It considered how uranium
mining might impact the Grand Can-
yon region.
In the end, the review produced a
1,500-page environmental impact report
outlining, in detail, the rationales for
different actions. Within the report,
there was a detailed analysis consid-
ering other mineral resources in the re-
gion, the very study the gentleman is
now trying to predicate the withdrawal
on.
The study did, indeed, find there were
a handful of other mineral resources in
the region, but the study also made
clear that these elements were sec-
ondary to uranium and that they oc-
curred in quantities insufficient to
drive mine development. This is why,
when you look at mineral claims in the
withdrawal area, they are almost all
for uranium.
We know uranium is the primary re-
source here, and we know the major
threat that uranium poses to clean
water, to public health, and to the
Grand Canyon itself.
Uranium mines have polluted ground
water and destroyed many commu-
nities across the Southwest. The land-
scape is littered with abandoned mine
sites.
We only need to consider Kanab
Creek Uranium Mine. It sits on the
edge of the Grand Canyon and has been
offline for years, yet virtually no reme-
diation has been done. You can see the
site is still covered in waste rock, ura-
nium ore tailings, and pond sludge.
This toxic waste is exposed to the envi-
ronment, escaping beyond the mine, in-
filtrating the soil, and elevating local
uranium levels.
This mine is only one of hundreds of
closed mines awaiting remediation. In-
dustry likes to pretend like practices
have changed, but they provide no as-
surances that they will do anything
but despoil the land and leave tax-
payers with the bill.
Despite protests from the gentleman
from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR), we know
what the resources are, and we know
what the threats are to this region.
We don’t need to duplicate a study to
tell us that we shouldn’t be mining in
the Grand Canyon, and we certainly
should not let misinformed talking
points kill this bill.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
oppose the amendment, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, this is a typ-
ical breccia pipe, and you are seeing
the collapsing of the geological forma-
tions. What is so interesting about that
is that it concentrates different min-
erals there, not just uranium. Copper,
vanadium, there are a number of things
here that have all of a sudden become
very critical in our technology sector.
This is a very important application
here, and we want to make sure that
we are studying that properly.
Now, if we are talking about the rec-
lamation process, well, here we go. Yes,
80 years ago, we didn’t reclaim mines
right. We didn’t ask them to be bonded.
We didn’t go back and investigate them
for mitigation.
This is what American mining actu-
ally does. It takes what they need; it
returns it. And I would be very inter-
ested in taking a Geiger counter to
check this versus this when it started.
I wonder if there is an improvement.
Deja vu? It is. So, once again, the ar-
guments are bland. They are fraudu-
lent. In this aspect, we show mitiga-
tion.
What we can do when we have a mine
site like this is we can actually lever-
age them and say: Listen, in order to
do this, we need you to mitigate some
of these other mining sites.
It has been something that our side
has proposed nonstop, but the other
side refuses to let that happen because,
they claim, that it is not going to be
up to standard. That tells you people
are scared of their own laws.
This looks pretty good to me. When I
look at the mitigation aspects and
what is here and available, that is for
the common cause for the American
people. It is an investiture. You are not
doing your due diligence unless you
know exactly what you have for today
and the future.
Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to
vote for this amendment. It is smart. It
is critical and, from that standpoint,
empowering. I ask everybody to vote
‘‘yes’’ on the amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, in
closing, and in opposition to the
amendment, in July, the President
formed a nuclear working group, the
Nuclear Fuel Working Group, essen-
tially to deal with the questions com-
ing from the uranium mining industry,
in particular, Energy Fuels and Ur-En-
ergy.
The issue there was an attempt to
try to defend the indefensible in trying
to open up the Grand Canyon once
more, looking at lifting the morato-
rium. So the urgency for the legisla-
tion before us is based on acts that the
administration has taken at this point.
One should note that Secretary Bern-
hardt represented Ur-Energy USA from
2009 to 2012.
My point is that enough advocates
exist for the mining industry as we
stand.
What we are asking, in defeat of this
amendment, is that the public interest
has some advocates, and that Members
of this body can take care of that pub-
lic interest and not the profit interests
that seem to be driving any decisions
around mining and particularly ura-
nium mining.
The public interest is the public
health, the Grand Canyon, the water
supply for 40 million people, and the
Tribes and indigenous people and com-
munities that exist there that have
been for decade upon decade coming to
this Congress, coming to their leader-
ship, asking for support and relief. This
bill begins to provide both.
Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I demand
a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Arizona will be
postponed.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I
move that the Committee do now rise.
The motion was agreed to.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.
TONKO) having assumed the chair, Mr.
CUELLAR, Acting Chair of the Com-
mittee of the Whole House on the state
of the Union, reported that that Com-
mittee, having had under consideration
the bill (H.R. 1373) to protect, for cur-
rent and future generations, the water-
shed, ecosystem, and cultural heritage
of the Grand Canyon region in the
State of Arizona, and for other pur-
poses, had come to no resolution there-
on.

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
consideration of the bill (H.R. 2181) to
provide for the withdrawal and protec-
tion of certain Federal land in the
State of New Mexico, with Mr.

ural Resources.
The gentlewoman from New Mexico
(Ms. HAALAND) and the gentleman from
Arizona (Mr. GOSAR) each will control
30 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New Mexico.
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, Du hino-meh. Idza dyu-qe-
dza. Svwimi Hanu. My name is DEBRA
HAALAND. I am from the Turquoise
Clan and an enrolled member of the La-
guna Pueblo.
I wish to acknowledge that we are on
Indian land, and I humbly ask to speak
on this important bill.
Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong sup-
port of H.R. 2181, the Chaco Cultural
Heritage Area Protection Act.
First, Mr. Chair, I would like to
thank my colleagues, Assistant Speak-
er BEN RAY LUJÁN, Senator TOM
UDALL, and Senator MARTIN HEINRICH
for their years of hard work on this im-
portant legislation.
This proposal, sponsored by my good
friend and fellow New Mexico Rep-
resentative, Mr. LUJÁN, would protect
the cultural resources at Chaco Culture
National Historical Park, as well as
New Mexico’s clean air, from the im-
pact of oil and gas extraction.
This bill would withdraw land in a 10-
mile buffer zone around Chaco Culture
National Historical Park to protect
that site and the region’s undiscovered
resources from the impacts of further
oil and gas extraction.
Chaco Canyon and the greater Chaco
region have been home to my people
for centuries. As a 35th generation New
Mexican and a descendant of the indig-
enous inhabitants of what is now the
Southwest United States, I can say
that there are few places more excep-
tional than the Chaco region. Over
hundreds of years, my ancestors engi-
neered and constructed massive multi-
story structures at Chaco Canyon that
became the ceremonial, administra-
tive, and economic center of the re-
gion.
It is a certified International Dark
Sky Park, where visitors can gaze at
the same dark sky with myriad stars
that my ancestors did over 1,000 years
ago.
These sites and the objects they con-
tain tell the history of my people and
connect us to our past.
The Indian Pueblos and the Navajo
Nation still have intimate connections
with the greater Chaco region, recog-
nizing the area as a spiritual place to
be honored and respected.
This Congress, the Natural Resources
Committee has heard from the leaders
of four Pueblo nations, the All Pueblo
Council of Governors, elected leaders of
the Navajo Nation, the National Con-
gress of American Indians, senior offi-
cials in Tribal and Pueblo govern-
ments, and a plethora of Americans, all
of whom support H.R. 2181.
The entire New Mexico Congressional
Delegation and the Governor of our
State support H.R. 2181.
This bill enjoys broad support on the
ground and bipartisan support here in
this Chamber because protecting indig-
enous cultural resources, protecting
Chaco Canyon, should not be a partisan
issue.
This proposal is about respecting our
history and protecting our culture. We
owe it to Tribal communities, to the
people of New Mexico, and to people
the world over to permanently protect
the Chaco region.
Earlier this year, I traveled to the
Chaco Culture National Historical
Park with several of my colleagues.
While in New Mexico, we had the op-
portunity to use infrared cameras to
watch plumes of methane and pollution
spewing from oil and gas operations,
creating a toxic cloud the size of Dela-
ware that hangs over the skies of
northwestern New Mexico.
Ninety percent of the Federal lands
in this region are already open to oil
and gas extraction, and New Mexicans
are all too familiar with the toxic im-
pacts it has on clean air, clean water,
their health, and the health of their
children.
b 1445
When you are out there watching the
methane plumes and experiencing the
dust, the noise, the light pollution and
their impacts, it is easy to see why oil
and gas extraction does not belong
next to a sacred ancestral site of the
Pueblo people.
If you don’t believe me, you can ask
Interior Secretary Bernhardt. When he
visited Chaco Canyon earlier this year
with Senator MARTIN HEINRICH, he defi-
nitely was struck by the significance of
the park because he committed to a
1-year moratorium on drilling around
Chaco Canyon to allow Congress to act
on proposals like the one before us
today.
I thank the Secretary for his efforts,
but 1 year is not enough protection for
a site that holds centuries of history
and culture. That is why I ask you all
to support Chaco Canyon today, to sup-
port the Pueblo people, the Navajo Na-
tion, and the people of New Mexico by
voting in favor of H.R. 2181.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to
H.R. 2181. Mr. Chairman, this is yet an-
other piece of legislation advanced by
my colleagues on behalf of the radical
environmental movement. This bill
will unilaterally lock up oil and gas de-
velopment on 316,000 acres of federally
owned land in New Mexico.
The Department of the Interior is in
the process of drafting a resource man-
agement plan for this area, but this
process is still under review and the re-
source management plan has not yet
been released. This bill would perma-
nently ban all energy development in
the area before we know all the facts
and before a science-based environ-
mental review is completed.
Decisions made in Washington re-
garding how to manage federally owned
land have implications beyond the bor-
ders of the acreage in question. Those
who own land or operate businesses
near federally owned parcels are often-
times significantly impacted by poor
management decisions made by the
Federal bureaucrats who do not live
there or understand the needs of the
rural Western communities.
Similarly, my colleagues claim that
this bill will do no harm to those who
own lands and mineral rights in the
surrounding area, but this bill could
mean millions in lost revenue for those
who own lands along the proposed
withdrawal boundary.
While it is technically true that the
acreage off limits to development
under this bill is federally owned, there
are lands located throughout the with-
drawal area that are privately owned
by the members of the Navajo Nation.
If you take a look at this map, any-
thing you see in this purple area—par-
ticularly in this area is what we are
talking about—is owned by the Navajo
allottees. So when you are looking at
the expansion of this park, it impugns
access to that area.
Now, as you see, the Navajo-owned
lands and minerals are scattered
throughout and are located outside the
withdrawal area. But if these lands are
unavailable for development, they be-
come restricted and further cut off
from access points and from develop-
ment opportunities. If the neighboring
land can never be developed, as re-
quired under this bill, the economic

value of these private minerals is di-
minished and the Navajo owners will
have a harder time attracting invest-
ments on their land.
Once again, you see the skirting all
the way through this area, particularly
in this band alongside there, so access
is critical.
We heard testimony to this fact in
the Natural Resources Committee this
summer. Ms. Delora Hesuse testified in
opposition to this bill, stating: ‘‘Our
voices as allotted landowners are being
silenced by environmentalists claiming
to speak for all of us. These lands were
given to our great-great-grandparents
in exchange for citizenship, and we
have rights as citizens and landowners
to develop our lands for oil and gas as
we see fit.’’
She continued: ‘‘If BLM lands are
withdrawn around our allotments, that
means oil and gas companies cannot
access our lands, because they won’t be
able to access the Federal lands.’’
Mr. Chairman, I include in the
RECORD her testimony.

NAGEEZI CHAPTER
TESTIMONY BEFORE THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON
NATURAL RESOURCES, SUBCOMMITTEE ON
NATIONAL PARKS, FORESTS AND PUBLIC
LANDS
LEGISLATIVE HEARING ON H.R. 2181 CHACO CUL-
TURAL HERITAGE AREA PROTECTION ACT—
JUNE 5, 2019
Chairwoman Haaland, Ranking Member
Young and members of the subcommittee,
thank you for the opportunity to bring voice
to those Navajo tribal members who are
being forgotten with this bill—Indian
allottees.
I am Delora Hesuse, a citizen of the Navajo
Nation, Nageezi Chapter. My chapter is in
the Greater Chaco region and near the Chaco
Culture National Historic Park. My grand-
mother was a Councilwoman for the Nageezi
Chapter for eight years, and my father was a
Navajo Nation Council Delegate for the
Nageezi Chapter for twenty years.
Many people don’t understand our Native
American heritage and the fact that many
individual Navajo Nation members such as I
own private lands and the minerals under-
neath them. This is a steadfast personal
property right that sustains our livelihoods
and way of life. H.R. 2181 would put many of
our mineral rights off limits and stop a
much-needed source of income to feed, shel-
ter, clothe and protect our families. I’m not
exaggerating the importance of this income.
In 2015, the Federal Indian Minerals Office
distributed $96 million to 20,835 allottees.
That’s a significant source of income in an
area that continues to struggle with unem-
ployment.
My ancestors were allotted the land and
mineral rights by the United States govern-
ment many generations ago, and it pains me
to see that my own leaders, both tribal and
in the U.S. House of Representatives and
Senate, are supporting a bill that would put
my oil and natural gas rights off limits and/
or seriously prevent my family from receiv-
ing income from the valuable energy re-
sources that we own.
I am not alone. Many other Indian
allottees in the Greater Chaco region agree
with me. In fact, I have here a petition
signed by 131 of us allottees opposing this
buffer zone bill.
I also have with me another petition
signed by many allottees that states that
the environmentalists’ voice is not our voice.
Our voices as Allotted landowners are being
silenced by environmentalists claiming to
speak for all of us. These lands were given to
our great, great grandparents in exchange
for citizenship, and we have rights as citi-
zens and landowners to develop our lands for
oil and gas as we see fit.
I also have two resolutions from the
Huerfano and Nageezi chapters signed by our
chapter presidents supporting us Navajo Al-
lotment landowners and recognizing our op-
position to this bill. These chapter resolu-
tions call for a meeting with Senators Udall
and Heinrich so that we can express our con-
cerns with the bill and how it will limit our
rights.
I am disappointed that the Department of
the Interior, which is supposed to manage
our mineral rights in trust to the benefit of
my family and all other allottees, has
stopped leasing for a full year. This action
delays income to us allottees in the short
term, but more importantly, sends a strong
signal to oil and gas companies that gen-
erate the income on our behalf that invest-
ment in the area is risky and uncertain in
the long term.
I have been participating actively in the
Resource Management Planning (RMP) proc-
ess which is under pressure from environ-
mental groups and others opposed to respon-
sible oil and natural gas development in the
area. I continue to feel that the Interior De-
partment and members of Congress are ig-
noring the voice of Indian allottees and lis-
tening only to environmental groups like
Diné Care and other outside groups that
want to keep oil and natural gas from being
developed at all.
Besides not being realistic, it would de-
prive my family of income to sustain our
way of life. Our voices should and must be
heard equally along with the environmental
special interest groups. In fact, with the In-
terior Department’s trust responsibility, our
voices should carry much more weight than
that of outside special interests, but that is
not the case with this bill.
The bill would put off limits my mineral
rights and the mineral rights of thousands of
allottees. While the bill claims not to affect
my mineral rights, in fact, many allottee
lands are surrounded by federal lands that
would be withdrawn by this bill. If BLM
lands are withdrawn around our allotments,
that means oil and gas companies cannot ac-
cess our lands, because they won’t be able to
access the federal lands.
Furthermore, since the oil and gas is
accessed using horizontal drilling, putting
the federal lands and minerals off limits will
mean my minerals are also off limits. Be-
cause of the checkerboard pattern of lands,
where allottee lands are often surrounded by
BLM lands, particularly in the northeast
segment of the buffer, if companies cannot
access all minerals along the lateral of a hor-
izontal well, they will not access any.
Companies will simply be discouraged from
developing the minerals on my behalf be-
cause it just doesn’t make sense economi-
cally or technologically to pinpoint my
small amount of minerals stranded amongst
federal minerals. What may be small to
them, however, is not small to me. Compa-
nies will be discouraged from developing in
all areas of the buffer at all, even on allottee
lands.
I too care deeply about the Chaco cultural
heritage. After all, I’m a Navajo who lives
right in the Greater Chaco region. But the
Chaco Culture National Historic Park al-
ready protects the Great Houses. Artifacts
that may be outside the park are protected
through the National Historic Preservation
Act. Any development of my minerals and
the minerals of other allottees is done in
strict accordance with the act, to make sure
they are protected. Not only do we insist
upon it, but that is the law of the land.
I urge the committee not to pass this bill.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify
today.
Mr. GOSAR. Further, two chapters of
the Navajo Nation representing a com-
bined 6,000 residents passed resolutions
opposing this bill because it would
jeopardize development and potentially
‘‘infringe on their royalty payments.’’
Mr. Chairman, I also include those in
the RECORD.

Secretary/Treasurer.
Mr. GOSAR. I should note, these are
significant sums which the Navajo
allottees depend on each and every
year. According to a 2017 Department
of the Interior IG report, 20,855 Navajo
allottees receive a collective $96 mil-
lion per year from revenues raised
through responsible oil and gas devel-
opment on their allotments. Quite sim-
ply, infringing on their right to develop
their mineral resources jeopardizes
their quality of life.
Further, oil and gas development has
blessed the State of New Mexico with
significant budget windfalls in recent
years. Just last week, the Department
of the Interior announced that the
State of New Mexico would receive
$1.17 billion in revenues from Federal
oil and gas development, the highest
disbursement in the State’s history.
2018 was a record-breaking year for
oil and gas development in New Mex-
ico, with State revenues reaching $2.2
billion, total. Roughly half of these
revenues will return directly to the
State’s schools, investing in higher pay
for teachers and staff, while other
funds were allocated for infrastructure
projects and public services.
These funds were provided by oil and
gas operations on not only Federal
lands, but on State trust lands, as well.
Roughly 8 percent of the withdrawal
area in this bill is owned by the State
of New Mexico and can be developed for
the benefit of its citizens. Enacting
this bill will cut off the revenue
streams from both Federal and State
energy development, reducing future
revenues for educational initiatives
like those signed into law earlier this
year.
Mr. Chairman, the Chaco Cultural
History Park is already protected and
off limits to oil and gas development. If
leasing were to occur in the sur-
rounding area, it would be subject to a
multitude of Federal laws and regula-
tions before any development could
begin, including the National Historic
Preservation Act, designed to protect
culturally significant areas and arti-
facts on all Federal lands.
Before we declare a permanent ban
on energy development in such a large
area, we need to have all of the facts.
We need to have a complete scientific
review and stakeholder engagement
process that is already underway. We
need to thoroughly weigh the benefits
and concerns, and we need to consider
all those who are impacted. Not doing
so could have significant consequences
for the Navajo allottees and for the
State of New Mexico’s budget and pri-
orities for its citizens.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from
New Mexico (Mr. LUJÁN).
Mr. LUJÁN. Mr. Chairman, my col-
league from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR) in the
previous debate, had some incredible
charts that he was displaying. In it, he
proclaimed: The rocks shall set you
free.
I was born and raised, and my faith
taught me, that the truth shall set you
free, Mr. Chairman. I was also taught
that people are entitled to their own
opinions, Mr. Chairman, but not their
own facts.
If my colleague from Arizona partici-
pated in those hearings, as he said he
did, he heard the witnesses from the
Bureau of Land Management, the wit-
ness from the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment in this direct question about the
rights of Navajo allottees being taken
away.
Some of my Republican colleagues
will argue that protecting Chaco will
impact the Navajo allottees’ right to
develop valid rights. This is blatantly
false.
Let the silence sit in. It is false.
The Bureau of Land Management tes-
tified before Congress and said that
this legislation ‘‘would not affect Trib-
al interests or allottees.’’
Mr. Chairman, it is critically impor-
tant that we have a conversation about

the importance of protecting Chaco.
While we have taken steps to defend
Chaco, Chaco is at risk of being hurt,
of being desecrated, of being destroyed.
That is why we have come together.
I would invite my colleague to join
us and visit Chaco, visit with the el-
ders, the women who are there, the
children who are in proximity of those
fumes that my colleague, the chair-
woman, DEB HAALAND from New Mex-
ico, was able to describe, where you
don’t just smell the methane; tech-
nology today allows you to see those
plumes move into people’s homes.
This legislation, Mr. Chairman, is
very clear. It puts in place a practice
by the Bureau of Land Management. It
takes out of production Federal land.
The lies need to stop about telling
our Navajo brothers and sisters who
are allottees that this will hurt their
access to those lands, that this will re-
strict access to those lands.
As a matter of fact, Mr. Chairman,
just to be thorough, an amendment
that I will offer later today will make
it even more clear that this, in fact, is
only about taking BLM land out of pro-
duction.
Mr. Chairman, with all the work that
we have left to do with us, this is a
piece of legislation supported by the
New Mexico delegation, something
that, based on the amendment that my
colleague from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR)
just offered, might understand. It is
supported by myself; the Representa-
tive from the district, Congresswoman
DEB HAALAND, one of the first two Na-
tive American women elected to the
Congress—and you heard the passion in
her voice; she is carrying the weight of
her ancestors on her shoulders as she
debates the fight to protect this sacred
land—Congresswoman TORRES SMALL,
U.S. Senator MARTIN HEINRICH, U.S.
Senator TOM UDALL, the Governor of
the State of New Mexico, and the Com-
missioner of Public Lands.
If you need a longer list of elected
leaders from New Mexico who support
this bill, I can make it available.
Let’s work together, Mr. Chairman.
And the last thing I will say is that
I am very proud that this legislation
will pass with bipartisan support. Pray
on it. Think about where our loved
ones have been laid to rest. We
wouldn’t want those grave sites being
desecrated. We don’t want this sacred
site being desecrated either.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, I love the passion in
the gentleman’s voice, but, once again,
it is not me. It is the allottees who
brought their voice forward, the Nav-
ajo allottees. They have seen, time and
time again, promises made by the Fed-
eral Government and promises not
kept.
So, once again, who would you rather
believe, the allottees or the BLM? Per-
sonally, I would side with the allottees.
When you look at the map, it tells
you the story you need to know. If we
are going to make an amendment, we
should guarantee access through any of
that application through this area, not
just through the BLM, but all this
area, because those are the resources of
the State.
Mr. LUJÁN. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. GOSAR. I yield to the gentleman
from New Mexico.
Mr. LUJÁN. Has the gentleman read
the bill?
Mr. GOSAR. Yes.
Mr. LUJÁN. If the gentleman read
the bill, he would see that the text has
made very clear this takes Bureau of
Land Management land out, not allot-
tee land; and if the gentleman would
review the clarifying amendment, he
would also see that, as well.
So don’t just take my word for it,
look at the text and look at the advice
of your staff.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, reclaim-
ing my time, once again, it says it
takes it off of mineral exposure, but it
doesn’t give access.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.
JOHNSON).
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr.
Chairman, I appreciate my colleague’s
presentation here. It is clear and con-
cise, and he raises important points.
Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to
H.R. 2181, the Chaco Cultural Heritage
Area Protection Act, as well.
Mr. Chairman, this is a flawed bill. It
is simply another attempt by our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle to
prevent our country from taking the
next steps in this era of American en-
ergy dominance.
What is important here is that Amer-
ican energy dominance is a great strat-
egy. It is a strategy that helps all
Americans, those in this immediate
area and around the country.
The legislation before us will, of
course, permanently restrict oil and
gas development in the area imme-
diately surrounding the Chaco Culture
National Historical Park.
Now, bear in mind, of course, as has
been pointed out here, exploration is
already restricted within the park;
and, of course, that is rightfully so.
But it is bad policy to create an arbi-
trary buffer zone for a prohibition on
development in the area around the
park.
In this Congress, our friends on the
other side of the aisle have made their
priorities crystal clear regarding the
management of our country’s re-
sources. So far, they have placed mora-
toriums on oil and gas production in
the eastern Gulf of Mexico, in the Pa-
cific and Atlantic planning areas, and
in ANWR. Apparently, that is not
enough. What we are hearing today is
that now we need to ban production in
the New Mexico areas, as well.
Mr. Chairman, at what point do we
say enough is enough?
The evidence shows, time and again,
that placing restrictions on energy de-
velopment only increases prices for
American consumers. And make no
mistake, these increases have the larg-
est impact on our most vulnerable
communities.
b 1500
I said this on the floor in Sep-
tember—many of us have—and I will
say it again today, the United States is
blessed because our land is filled with
an abundance of natural resources. My
own congressional district back in Lou-
isiana is home of one of the largest
natural gas reserves in the country.
We believe, we insist that we have
the means and the responsibility to use
those God-given resources to create
jobs, foster economic growth, and pave
the way to an era of American energy
dominance. Oppressive policies like the
ones before us today have been our own
worst enemy.
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on
this bill.
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Arizona (Mr. GALLEGO).
Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chair, I rise in
support of H.R. 2181, the Chaco Cul-
tural Heritage Area Protection Act.
Ancient civilizations called the area
around Chaco Canyon home thousands
of years before the earliest settlers of
ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. In
fact, Native American people have oc-
cupied this region continuously since
10,000 BC, creating massive public and
ceremonial buildings, a complex sys-
tem of roads for trade, and beautiful
crafts and artwork.
Today, there are more than 4,000 ar-
cheological sites, millions of artifacts,
and countless sacred cultural resources
that provide modern-day Native people
a direct link to their ancestors who
lived in the area thousands of years
ago.
Reckless oil and gas development
could destroy the fragile archeological
and cultural resources in the area, in-
cluding ones that have not yet been
discovered or cataloged. In fact, there
has never been a comprehensive Na-
tive-led study of the cultural resources
in the Chaco region.
It is fitting that we are talking about
protecting Chaco Canyon in New Mex-
ico and the Grand Canyon in Arizona
on the same day. Both are UNESCO
World Heritage sites, and both are na-
tional treasures needlessly threatened
by industry to pad their bottom line.
That is why I strongly support the
Grand Canyon Centennial Protection
Act debated earlier and why I urge my
colleagues to support this bill and the
10-mile protection zone around Chaco
Canyon’s archeological resources and
the present-day communities that it
creates.
This is sacred ground that we have an
obligation to protect for future genera-
tions to enjoy and learn about. We
must pass this bill to preserve this
place to teach our children and our
children’s children about the rich his-
tory and culture of the Native people
who lived in the American Southwest.
I urge my colleagues to support this
bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8627
October 30, 2019
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4
minutes to the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. WESTERMAN).
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I
rise today in opposition to H.R. 2181,
the Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Pro-
tection Act of 2019.
This unnecessary bill would perma-
nently ban oil and gas development on
about 316,000 acres of land in New Mex-
ico. It would also incur $3 million in in-
creased spending costs with no built-in
mechanism to pay for it.
H.R. 2181’s proposed landgrab would
surround Chaco Culture National His-
torical Park. The park itself is already
under Federal protections, including a
prohibition on mineral development.
This bill would add 10 extra miles of
protected area around the perimeter of
the park. This arbitrary addition could
have long-term negative repercussions
to the State of New Mexico.
H.R. 2181 would also impact the very
Navajo Nation members it claims to
protect. Many of them own lands and
mineral rights in the area that have
been passed down for generations, but
this bill would make it virtually im-
possible for them to develop the energy
resources to which they are rightfully
entitled. The complex puzzle of inter-
locking Federal, State, Tribal, and pri-
vate land in the disputed area would
result in significant hurdles for the
Navajo Nation, creating a de facto ex-
traction ban.
In June of this year, a Navajo Nation
representative who owns some of these
mineral resources came to Capitol Hill
to testify in front of the Natural Re-
sources Committee on behalf of 131
Navajo Nation members about how det-
rimental H.R. 2181 would be to their
land. This bill ignores the request of
local landowners and continues the
pattern of government overreach in the
West.
H.R. 2181 also completely sidesteps
the Department of the Interior’s re-
source management plan for the area.
This plan is currently undergoing envi-
ronmental review and will be publicly
released at some point. To perma-
nently ban all future energy develop-
ments before we know all of the facts
and research conclusions is uncalled
for.
I have stood here at this podium and
spoken at length about American en-
ergy dominance and good environ-
mental stewardship because I believe
they can go hand in hand. Every indi-
cator we have shows that energy pro-
duction is becoming cleaner, faster,
and cheaper by the day. Refusing to
allow safe energy development on Fed-
eral land isn’t environmentally friend-
ly; it is just bad science and a thinly
veiled power grab.
As foreign energy sources become in-
creasingly unpredictable, it is impera-
tive that we tap into our vast domestic
energy potential in sustainable ways
and that we don’t arbitrarily restrict
future development.
Keep in mind that any leasing in
these areas is subject to a host of Fed-
eral regulations and oversight already.
Any development must comply with
the National Historic Preservation Act
and NEPA. These laws are in place to
protect and preserve historically sig-
nificant sites across our country.
But that is not the issue here. In-
stead, we are debating areas com-
pletely outside the boundaries of the
Chaco Culture area. My Democratic
colleagues are rushing to pass this bill
without hearing the concerns of local
Navajo Nation members or waiting to
read the Department of the Interior
analysis of the area. These hasty con-
clusions are unnecessary, with poten-
tially devastating effects on New Mexi-
co’s revenue stream.
I urge my fellow Members to consider
the negative implications of this bill
and vote against H.R. 2181.
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from
New Mexico (Mr. LUJÁN).
Mr. LUJÁN. Mr. Chair, I simply want
to respond to my colleague that was
just speaking.
This area is within those exterior
boundaries of the archeological sites
and findings and indigenous lands that
we referred to as Chaco.
I would invite my colleague to come
out to New Mexico. I will take the gen-
tleman out there. Congresswoman
DEBRA HAALAND would love to host the
gentleman.
My colleague from the other side of
the aisle brought up this notion that
this development is subject to Federal
law.
The CHAIR. The time of the gen-
tleman has expired.
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Chair, I yield the
gentleman from New Mexico an addi-
tional 30 seconds.
Mr. LUJÁN. If the gentleman would
take a moment and go to the NOAA
website, the gentleman would see that
New Mexico has two methane clouds
over it. We have the two worst meth-
ane emissions of anywhere in the coun-
try, even though we don’t have the
most oil and gas production.
I am sorry my colleague is not able
to stay for this debate.
Mr. Chairman, right now, there is a
theft taking place to U.S. taxpayers be-
cause there is intentional leaking of
methane that is taking place. You can
see it.
There is technology, now, that allows
you not just to—when you are out
there, Mr. Chairman, you can smell it.
But the technology now lets you see
these plumes going into people’s homes
who live right there.
Let’s find a way to be smart about
this. I agree with that. But there are
places we have to protect, and this is
one of them.
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from
New York (Mr. TONKO).
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentlewoman for yielding.
Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong sup-
port of H.R. 2181, the Chaco Cultural
Heritage Area Protection Act of 2019.
One thousand years ago, Chaco Can-
yon was the center of a vibrant ances-
tral Puebloan culture that became the
focal point for ceremonies, for trade,
and for political activity in the pre-
historic Four Corners area.
Today, thousands of ancestral sites
and cultural resources are spread
across the Chaco region, while at the
same time pump jacks, such as the one
shown here, have become increasingly
present across the landscape.
Currently, only a small portion of
the region’s sacred sites and abundant
cultural resources are protected within
the Chaco Cultural National Historical
Park, with much of the surrounding
land available for oil and gas develop-
ment.
The greater Chaco region is a prime
example of how sacred sites are facing
increased threats from encroaching oil
and gas development and the Trump
administration’s energy dominance
agenda. The Bureau of Land Manage-
ment has already leased over 90 percent
of the public land in the larger San
Juan Basin for oil and gas extraction,
and under the Trump administration,
BLM has proposed to lease parcels near
Chaco on three different occasions.
Increased fossil fuel extraction not
only threatens the region’s cultural re-
sources, it also threatens clean air and
water, as well as the health and safety
of surrounding communities.
New Mexico’s methane emissions are
already the highest in the country, and
it will only get worse if the region is
open to increased extraction. That re-
leased methane—a greenhouse gas that
is 34 times more impactful than CO2—
is a significant contributor to the on-
going climate crisis.
I urge my colleagues to safeguard our
Nation against the threat of continued
climate change and vote to protect
Chaco’s unparalleled collection of an-
cient ruins and the health of local com-
munities from the impacts of oil and
gas extraction.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I would love to engage with the gen-
tleman from New Mexico if the gen-
tleman would not mind.
Mr. Chair, Members are bringing up
this concept of methane capture. There
is an easy solution.
Is the gentleman in favor of pro-
viding a pipeline, because what ends up
happening, we can recover almost 100
percent of the methane emissions when
we have a pipeline nearby, because
then it becomes profitable and it be-
comes something that we can actually
utilize.
Mr. LUJÁN. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I yield to the
gentleman from New Mexico.
Mr. LUJÁN. Would it surprise the
gentleman from Arizona that they are
actually using duct tape to try to seal
leaks from methane plumes in New
Mexico? Does the gentleman think that
is allowed?
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I would let
the gentleman know that I am one of

these technology nerds. I have been
visiting with people who have revolu-
tionized and have new ideas in regard
to pipelines that would set this on fire.
So if we are looking at technology,
we ought to be looking at in the right
way. It is beneficial. We are living
longer, not like what we were at the
turn of the 1900s, which was shorter.
My point is, if there is technology
out there for pipelines that is very con-
sistent with almost 100 percent cap-
ture, wouldn’t the gentleman entertain
that?
I yield to the gentleman from New
Mexico.
Mr. LUJÁN. Mr. Chair, I think the
gentleman and I may actually be able
to find some common ground.
There are available technologies
today—as the gentleman may know,
being in tune with modern technology
associated with oil and gas explo-
ration—that can identify leaks, can
prevent those leaks, and actually can
eliminate intentional flaring, but first
you have to find them and you have to
seal those leaks.
Mr. Chair, I would be happy to work
with the gentleman to identify a fund-
ing stream so that we can identify
every methane leak across America,
seal every leak, and prevent inten-
tional methane flaring.
I think there is some common ground
we can work on, because this is all
about compromise, and this may be an
area that—the gentleman, Mr. GOSAR,
someone I respect—we might be able to
find some common ground.
We will take the gentleman out to
New Mexico. We will put the gentle-
man’s eyes on that camera where the
gentleman can see the plumes moving.
And while they may try to fix it tem-
porarily with duct tape—sometimes on
the farm we do it with baling wire, as
the gentleman knows—we should use
real technology, eliminate those leaks,
eliminate those plumes, and actually
make it illegal to intentionally flare.
Let’s find common ground on that.
Does the gentleman know why they
flare the methane? That is stealing
from taxpayers.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, reclaiming
my time, I have no problem. What I
would ask in return is let’s turn around
and go back to Petra Nova down in
Texas where we have a coal-fired plant
that actually captures 100 percent of
any emissions. It takes it down into
the gas areas and actually injects it
back in, squeegeeing what the rest of
the oil and gas is, and then it con-
denses into limestone. It is pretty in-
teresting technology.
So I appreciate the gentleman for his
back-and-forth, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. GRIJALVA).
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I rise
to have my voice heard in support of
H.R. 2181, the Chaco Cultural Heritage
Area Protection Act.
This proposal that is sponsored by
my friend, Mr. LUJÁN, with the support
of the chairwoman of the Sub-
committee on National Parks, Forests,
and Public Lands, Representative
HAALAND, also from New Mexico, is an-
other important step towards recog-
nizing and elevating the voices and the
presence of Native communities in this
Chamber.
As the chairwoman mentioned in her
opening statement, our committee has
heard from Puebloan and Tribal leaders
throughout this Congress about how
important it is to protect Chaco. These
communities want to see Chaco, their
ancestral homeland, protected from oil
and gas drilling.
This is an important piece of legisla-
tion. It is an agreed-upon proposal that
balances regional development with
the needs to ensure that special places
and, indeed, sacred places are off lim-
its. It fits well into the work this
Chamber is doing today and has been
doing all Congress. We are listening to
diverse voices, protecting the rights of
Native communities, and conserving
our public lands for the benefit of cur-
rent and future generations.
Mr. Chair, I hope our colleagues will
join us in this important work by vot-
ing today to protect irreplaceable sites
that are important to Native commu-
nities and supported by folks on the
ground and that are critical to the
story of this Nation of ours.
b 1515
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5
minutes to the gentleman from Utah
(Mr. BISHOP), who is the ranking mem-
ber of the full committee.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman,
it is wonderful to be back down here on
the floor again with all of you. I thank
Mr. GRIJALVA for that. I would have
been here earlier had the gentleman
not scheduled a hearing on our com-
mittee at the same time as we are sup-
posed to have all our committee bills
here on the floor. But we hit both of
those at any rate.
We have three bills on the floor here
today—I’m really sorry I missed the
first one—three bills that are so bad
they make the umpire last night actu-
ally look good.
This particular one has one of those
problems that still exists. If the State
of New Mexico or New Mexico’s leaders
want to give away the $1.17 billion they
just got a check from last time from
this development, that is okay with
me. Actually, it probably means that
more money is going to come to my
State eventually from that pot. But it
is not okay to forget that those people
who really understand what they are
talking about, those who live closely in
the area, really need to have their
voices heard, specifically.
I have to equate, once again, as has
been brought up already, but I want to
reemphasize, the two chapters in clos-
est proximity that really have an im-
pact on here both voted against this
bill. They both sent resolutions against
this bill. Those who actually have seen
what it is like to deal with the Federal
Government on that personal basis
have sent resolutions against this bill.
This bill has the potential of dis-
rupting 20,000 Native Americans—al-
most all Navajo—who are allottees in
this particular area. Even though some
will contend that the Federal Govern-
ment has said they will not be a prob-
lem, if we look at the history of deal-
ing with the Federal Government,
then, obviously, the concerns that the
private sector has and those citizens
who live in this area have for this bill
are pretty obvious. There is historical
precedence on when that should take
place, and until there is some kind of
verification of that, then we ought to
be very careful in which way we decide
to go in this particular order.
Let me also say one other thing here,
because this is a frustration I have
with the entire process. As we know,
bad procedure creates bad policy. But
the bill that we have just discussed
dealt with a park that has a huge
maintenance backlog. Even though
changing the mining procedures around
the park will have nothing to do with
the water, it certainly doesn’t solve
the maintenance backlog. This bill will
all deal with withdrawals from the Bu-
reau of Land Management lands which,
once again, have a huge maintenance
backlog. So I am going to say, once
again, to our friends on the other side,
if you really want to talk about park-
lands in Arizona, BLM lands in New
Mexico, and whatever those lands in
Colorado are going to be, all on the
same day, and we have that huge main-
tenance backlog, then for heaven’s
sakes, bring that bill onto the floor. I
realize how controversial it may be.
There are only 328 cosponsors of the
bill. I am sure that probably would be
able to go on suspension.
But until we have actually addressed
the maintenance backlog and not held
that up as some kind of sad quid pro
quo or sad element of trying to black-
mail for something else or try to at-
tach bad elements to it that will actu-
ally negate the impact of that bill, we
are piddling around here. Bring that
bill for the maintenance backlog to the
floor. Let us have a vote. Let us move
on to solve real problems instead of
those that we are creating with these
three bills that are going to be before
us today.
Are they terrible bills?
Who knows?
Will they result in better quality in
other Western States that have public
lands?
Who knows?
Are some of the Native Americans
who live in that area very sceptical of
it?
Obviously.
Is there a history of the inability of
working these things out?
Obviously.
Should they have worked out the de-
tails with the BLM before we actually
introduced land?
Yes, obviously.
But, once again, Mr. Chairman, we
have three bills that make that play on

first base look really good in compari-
son.
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Colorado (Ms. DEGETTE).
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Chairman, as we
heard, Chaco Canyon is a UNESCO
World Heritage site, and the reason it
is listed this way is because it is a
place of magic and history. Anyone
who has slept there under the stars, as
I have, and as I would urge my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle to
do, knows what a special and unique
place this is and why it must be pro-
tected.
But there are many ways one can
damage an historic site. Obviously, you
can damage the very soil that it sits
on. But you can also damage the air
quality that the visitors to this site
find every year.
Oil and gas development produces
smog and gas flares that harm animals,
vegetation, and people who live nearby.
It also undermines the park’s pristine
night skies that attract thousands of
visitors every year. It emits methane
that leads to harmful ground-level
ozone pollution, and it is just not
worth destroying this precious treas-
ure.
I support reasonable oil and gas de-
velopment throughout the West in my
State, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and
so many places. But just because we
should have oil and gas development in
appropriate places doesn’t mean we
should have it everywhere, certainly
not near or in Chaco Canyon. That is
why I support this legislation, Mr.
Chairman, and I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, for the record, I would
like to reiterate a number of institu-
tions that are against H.R. 2181. To
preface that, we set precedents and we
codify precedents. So that is why, Mr.
Chairman, you will have multiple
States disagreeing with H.R. 2181.
So for those who are against H.R.
2181, you have the American Explo-
ration and Mining Association, there is
a group letter; Arizona Liberty, group
letter; Arizona Mining Association,
group letter; Arizona Pork Producers,
group letter; Arizona Rock Products
Association; group letter; Conserv-
atives for Property Rights, a letter;
Denver Lumber Company, a letter; en-
Core Energy Corporation; Mohave
County Supervisor Buster Johnson, a
letter; New Mexico Business Coalition,
a letter; New Mexico Cattle Growers
Association; New Mexico Federal
Lands Council; New Mexico Wool Grow-
ers Association; Western Energy Alli-
ance; and Women’s Mining Coalition.
These are just some of the people who
are against it.
When we look at this board, we have
this designation, you see it here in
Chaco Canyon.
What wisdom did they have when
they first put this together?
That is what I want to ask. The di-
mensions here are for a reason.
Why are we expending this, particu-
larly when there is so little trust in the
Federal Government?
I think we have just realized that we
had to move a part of our govern-
ment—I think the BLM, if I remember
right—out to Grand Junction, Colo-
rado, so that we actually had some bu-
reaucrats who actually understood the
dilemmas that are out there in Western
culture and in Western States.
Yes, Western States gave up a lot.
They gave a lot up compared to our
Eastern cohorts. We gave property to
the Federal Government for steward-
ship, however, that has been abused.
The products that we were supposed to
get off those lands as public lands have
dwindled.
Eastern States call us beggars in re-
gard to payment in lieu of taxes be-
cause we can’t tax these Federal lands.
And we are begging for pennies on the
dollar.
Something is wrong with that.
We are also vested in the community
application of the best management of
these resources and getting the highest
yield out of it. It is like an investment.
How do we get the best out of this
area?
When you look at this, no wonder the
Navajo allottees don’t trust the Fed-
eral Government. Tell me when the
Federal Government has honored their
promise.
Look at the Navajo generating sta-
tion in Arizona. This was a promise to
the Navajo and Hopi Tribes to have
work that was dependent upon them,
that gave them the benefits of that en-
trepreneurship and that reflection of
minerals. Sixty percent of the Navajo
economy is based off of the Navajo gen-
erating station at the mine. That is
gone. Eighty percent of the Hopis on
the mine and NGS. That is gone. So it
is no wonder these Navajo allottees
don’t trust the Federal Government. I
don’t blame them.
Trust is a series of promises kept.
Until we can start honoring our prom-
ises, we have got to stop this foolish-
ness. There is plenty of land there. I
want to see my sites, but I also want
my energy, too. There is a way of going
about it.
We engaged with the gentleman from
New Mexico. It is going to be a wonder-
ful aspect to start talking about tech-
nology in regard to recouping 100 per-
cent of the methane and anything else
that comes out of it.
I do come from northern Arizona
where I can see the stars. I don’t want
to ever lose sight of that, because I
think it was Buzz Lightyear who said:
To infinity and beyond. That is the
way we should also be.
But it is not about victimization, it
is about empowerment. I believe these
Navajo allottees deserve their rights to
make sure that the government honors
their promise. I want cultural sites to
be honored. But I wonder what the dif-
ference is when this site is held in this
parameter and why we are going about
the business to expand it even further.
Once again, enough is enough.
Mr. LUJÁN. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. GOSAR. I yield to the gentleman
from New Mexico.
Mr. LUJÁN. Mr. Chairman, I appre-
ciate the gentleman yielding, because
one of the resolutions from the two
chapters was raised, and think it was
raised by the gentleman as well, so I
just wanted to make sure we had a
chance to review that.
So if that resolution is reviewed, if
the gentleman would look at paragraph
4, which is where the concern that was
brought up by the allottees to the very
distinguished and honorable chapter
leaders was raised, what it says is this:
‘‘Navajo allotment landowners ex-
pressed their concerns that the ‘Chaco
Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act
of 2018:’ might infringe on their royalty
payments they are presently benefit-
ting from oil and gas development on
their allotment lands. Navajo commu-
nities, including the Navajo Reserva-
tion, has always been in a very de-
pressed economic state for many years
and such development of natural re-
sources gives Navajo families benefits
to their daily lives.’’
The Bureau of Land Management did
provide assurance that there would be
no impact to those royalty payments.
So to answer the question of might
infringe, the Department of the Inte-
rior and the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment have said absolutely not would
there be any infringement. So I appre-
ciate the gentleman’s time, and I ap-
preciate the clarification.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, reclaim-
ing my time, I thank the gentleman for
that. But, once again, trust is a series
of promises kept.
When has the Federal Government
held their trust up to the Tribal men or
even allottees?
It doesn’t matter if they are Native
American. We have had a number of
mining claims that have been stymied
because the Forest Service or the BLM
will not give them access, even though
they have allowed and stated that they
would have access to that claim.
So, once again, it is a hollow prom-
ise; and, once again, I beseech individ-
uals until the government starts hon-
oring promises, they are not entitled to
the hierarchy of trust. That is just it.
I trust people more than I do the gov-
ernment. A government that can give
all can take all. I’m not for that. I’m
for empowerment. I’m not for victim-
ization.
What I have seen, I don’t like. I have
seen that the promise to the Navajo
people and to the Hopi people is lame.
We are going to take these good-pay-
ing jobs in northern Arizona, and we
are going to give them welfare?
How discouraging is that?
Does that lift a person’s spirit?
No, it doesn’t.
It doesn’t give them upward mobil-
ity. I thought that was the American
experience. It is sad that we are at this
point in time. I think we need to have

good politics. None of that exists right
now. None of that exists.

Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to

Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, H.R. 2181 is a broadly sup-
ported proposal to protect the cultural
resources of Chaco Canyon. This bill
has the support of the All Pueblo Coun-
cil of Governors, the Navajo Nation,
the entire New Mexico delegation, and
the New Mexico Governor, not to men-
tion any number of elected officials
across our beautiful State.
This proposal has been worked on for
a very long time. Over many hours,
weeks, and years, many voices have
been heard. If we are serious about lift-
ing up Tribal voices and responding to
the priorities of Native American com-
munities, we need to listen to the Trib-
al leaders who are asking us to protect
Chaco Canyon. The people of New Mex-
ico know the impacts oil and gas devel-
opment can have on clean air, clean
water, and the health of our children.
Mr. Chair, 90 percent of the San Juan
Basin is already available for oil and
gas leasing. We can protect this sacred
land because gas and oil doesn’t need
to take up every single inch of our
State. This proposal is about pro-
tecting a small sacred area for Tribal
communities that have a connection to
this special place and still use this area
for ceremonies to pray and to worship.
There may be dissenting voices, as
there always are when we make
changes to land management policy,
but we must listen to the elected lead-
ers who represent these places. Quite
frankly, the majority of New Mexicans
support this legislation on this issue.
The delegation, the Governor, and
the elected Tribal leaders have spoken
in a unified voice and asked us to pro-
tect Chaco Canyon. I thank Represent-
ative LUJÁN for his hard work.
I encourage my colleagues to vote
‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 2181, and I invite anyone
to come to New Mexico and visit this
beautiful place and know for certain
why it is that we are fighting so hard
to protect it.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I include the fol-
lowing letters in the RECORD.

Hon. RAÚL GRIJALVA,
Chairman, House Committee on Natural Re-
sources, Washington, DC.
Hon. ROB BISHOP,
Ranking Member, House Committee on Natural
Resources, Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN GRIJALVA AND RANKING
MEMBER BISHOP: I write to you today to ex-
press my strong opposition to H.R. 2181, the
‘‘Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection
Act of 2019’’. This bill permanently bans oil,
natural gas, coal and other minerals from
federal leasing and future development on
316,000 acres in New Mexico while also per-
manently terminating leases in the area that
have yet to go into production.
H.R. 2181 places our economic and energy
security at risk by putting an area rich in oil
and gas resources permanently off limits to
production. This bill will harm tribal mem-
bers, reduce general fund and education reve-
nues infringe on private property rights and
negatively impact local economies.
The area in question has proven to hold
large reserves of oil and gas resources. BLM
recognized the potential in this area and pro-
posed to include several parcels near Chaco
Canyon in its oil and gas lease sale on March
28, 2019.
The so-called ‘‘buffer zone’’ imposed by
this bill is completely unnecessary, as oil
and gas production has taken place in this
area for decades, with no damage to the na-
tional park. In fact, the expressed purpose of
the park was to protect the culturally sig-
nificant ruins and great houses of the Chaco
people, and the boundaries of the park were
drawn for that very goal.
H.R. 2181 will harm education. In fiscal
year 2018, oil and natural gas production gen-
erated $2.2 billion for New Mexico’s general
fund and accounted for one-third of all rev-
enue in the fund. More than $820 million of
these funds flowed to k–12 schools, providing
enough revenues enough to cover the salaries
of nearly 11,500 teachers.
It was clear from the manner in which the
committee treated this bill that the voices
of tribal members were not adequately con-
sidered. In fact, no allottees were invited to
speak at the site visit or at the sub-
committee hearing in New Mexico discussing
this legislation.
Delora Hesuse, a Navajo with private min-
eral rights in New Mexico, claims the con-
cerns of Indian allottees have not been heard
and that the proposed 316,000-acre ‘‘buffer’’ is
a solution in search of a problem. According
to Western Wire, Hesuse stated, ‘‘How come
we don’t have a voice in this? . . . Environ-
mentalists and others claiming to speak on
their behalf have ‘not even consulted us or
asked our permission . . . Her fellow
allottees were passed over for [opponents]
and environmental activists and not in-
cluded in the panel discussions at the field
hearings. We oppose the buffer zone because
it’s never been an issue. Everyone knew their
boundaries. She said residents near Chaco
have been receiving royalties since the 1970s
and they don’t want that critical income to
go away.’’
H.R. 2181 imposes an assault on Indian
allottees that hold private mineral rights in
the withdrawal area and tramples on prop-
erty rights. This bill makes their assets
worthless, taking away valuable royalty
payments from these impoverished commu-
nities. To put this in perspective, in 2015
alone, the Federal Indian Minerals Office dis-
tributed $96 million to 20,835 allottees
throughout the country.
Allottees in the Chaco region have consist-
ently expressed opposition to this proposed
withdrawal. Instead of listening to all local
voices, the proponents of this bill have pan-
dered to environmental groups who claim to
represent all the relevant stakeholders on
this matter, but clearly do not.
There are already numerous federal and
state laws and regulations on the books that
adequately protect the Chaco National Park.
The oil and gas industry has both a legal and
moral obligation to protect the artifacts of
the Chaco people, as well as avoiding im-
pacts on newly discovered artifacts, which it
has always done. American energy produc-
tion and protecting the environment are not
mutually exclusive goals. Chaco will con-
tinue to be protected while responsible oil
and gas production occurs, benefitting edu-
cation and reducing carbon emissions in the
process.
Again, I oppose H.R. 2181 and urge its rejec-
tion.
Sincerely,
BUSTER D. JOHNSON,
Mohave County Supervisor, District III.

Hon. RAUL GRIJALVA,
Chairman, House Committee on Natural Re-
sources,
Washington, DC.
Hon. ROB BISHOP,
Ranking Member, House Committee on Natural
Resources,
Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN GRIJALVA AND RANKING
MEMBER BISHOP: The Independent Petroleum
Association of America (IPAA) strongly op-
poses H.R. 2181, the Chaco Cultural Heritage
Area Protection Act. IPAA did not object
when Interior Secretary Bernhardt issued a
one-year freeze on leasing in order to com-
plete the ongoing Resource Management
Plan (RMP) in the area. We believe it is im-
portant to have all the facts before making
any land management decision involving
public lands. However, despite the fact that
the RMP has not yet been released, House
Democratic leadership plans to bring H.R.
2181 to the floor for a vote in the coming
weeks. This legislation is premature and
locks-up land in the region before we have
all the facts from the RMP. This bill would
permanently ban federal oil and natural gas
leasing on roughly 316,000 acres of land in
New Mexico and terminate existing leases. It
is bad policy to act before we know the facts.
While the sponsors of this legislation claim
it will not affect Native American allottee
mineral rights, the reality is far different.
H.R. 2181 will create significant access and
extraction complications for the Tribal
allottees along with any companies they
partner with and will lead to a de facto min-
eral extraction ban on their lands.
At a June 5, 2019 hearing in the Natural
Resources Committee on the legislation, a
witness with allottee land from the Navajo
Nation, Nageezi chapter testified against the
bill stating that H.R. 2181 would ‘‘put many
of our mineral rights off limits and stop a
much-needed source of income to feed, shel-
ter, clothe and protect our families.’’ The
witness also submitted for the record a peti-
tion signed by 131 Navajo allottees opposing
this legislation, as well as two resolutions

from the Huerfano and Nageezi Navajo chap-
ters, which are closest to this area, express-
ing support for the Navajo allotment land-
owners and recognizing their opposition to
this bill.
IPAA has been content to let the Chaco
Canyon RMP process proceed to its conclu-
sion. However, we cannot support any efforts
to increase the area’s boundary before all the
RMP is completed. The main purpose of es-
tablishing the Chaco Culture National His-
torical Area was to protect every area of his-
torical significance. That goal has been ac-
complished. Extending the boundaries and
adding acreage to the Heritage Area will not
enhance protection of areas of historical sig-
nificance. There are no areas outside the cur-
rently designated boundaries that qualify for
protections. However, the park expansion
would have economically devastating im-
pacts on those who live closest to the area.
For these reasons, IPAA urges you to vote
‘‘NO’’ on H.R. 2181.

Hon. RAUL GRIJALVA,
Chairman, House Committee on Natural Re-
sources,
Washington, DC.
Hon. ROB BISHOP,
Ranking Member, House Committee on Natural
Resources,
Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN GRIJALVA AND RANKING
MEMBER BISHOP: Western Energy Alliance
strongly opposes H.R. 2181, the Chaco Cul-
tural Heritage Area Protection Act. This bill
permanently bans new federal oil and nat-
ural gas leasing and development on 316,000
acres in New Mexico while also terminating
existing leases.
H.R. 2181 puts at risk the local economy
and the livelihoods of thousands of Indian
allottees in the area by making it very dif-
ficult if not impossible for them to develop
the energy resources they own. While the bill
purports to leave Indian allottees unaffected,
the reality is that the interlocking nature of
the federal and allottee estates means that
companies will avoid developing in the area.
With today’s horizontal drilling of two-mile
laterals it is not possible to avoid the federal
mineral estate while still producing on pock-
ets of allottee minerals. If the bill passes,
companies will have no recourse but to avoid
developing Indian allottee energy resources.
For this reason, Indian allottees oppose
this bill. When Indian allottee Delora Hesuse
testified before the committee in June, she
attached to her testimony petitions with sig-
natures of other allottees who also oppose
the threat to their families’ oil and natural
gas income. As she testified, the money she
and 20,835 other Indian allottees earn from
their energy property is about $96 million
annually. That huge source of income in an
area otherwise plagued by unemployment
and poverty is threatened by this bill.
The area containing the highly productive
Mancos Shale that would be excluded from
federal development has been proven to hold
large reserves of oil and natural gas. But the
exclusionary zone imposed by this bill is
completely unnecessary, as oil and natural
gas production has taken place in this area
for decades, with no damage to the national
park. In fact, the expressed purpose of the
park boundaries is to protect the culturally
significant ruins and great houses of the
Chaco people.
We urge the committee not to pass this
bill. Thank you for considering our input.
Sincerely,
KATHLEEN M. SGAMMA,
President.
The CHAIR. All time for general de-
bate has expired.
Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be
considered for amendment under the 5-
minute rule. The amendment printed
in part D of House Report 116–264 shall
be considered as adopted, and the bill,
as amended, shall be considered as

H.R. 2181
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Chaco Cul-
tural Heritage Area Protection Act of 2019’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(1) there are archeological, sacred, and his-
toric resources located throughout the
Greater Chaco region, which spans the
States of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and
Colorado;
(2) the Chaco Culture National Historical
Park, a unit of the National Park System
and a United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization World Heritage
Site, is known around the world—
(A) for multi-story buildings constructed
by the Chacoan people that are still stand-
ing; and
(B) as the nerve center of a culture that
spread throughout and dominated the Four
Corners area during the 9th, 10th, and 11th
centuries;
(3) the Chacoan people built hundreds of
miles of roads and a network of villages,
shrines, and communications sites, many of
which are still visible;
(4) many Pueblos and Indian Tribes in the
Four Corners area claim cultural affiliation
with, and are descended from, the Chacoan
people;
(5) the landscape around the Chaco Culture
National Historical Park includes hundreds
of internationally and nationally significant
cultural resources, including prehistoric
roads, communities, and shrines—
(A) many of which are related to the re-
sources found in the Chaco Culture National
Historical Park, including the resources rec-
ognized by the amendment made by section
3 of the Chacoan Outliers Protection Act of
1995 (16 U.S.C. 410ii note; Public Law 104–11)
providing for additional Chaco Culture Ar-
cheological Protection Sites;
(B) a significant number of which are con-
centrated within the immediate area sur-
rounding the Chaco Culture National Histor-
ical Park; and
(C) that are commonly recognized by ar-
cheologists;
(6) long considered one of the best places
for stargazing in the world, Chaco Culture
National Historical Park—
(A) in 1991, established a night skies pro-
tection initiative and interpretive program
to protect the night sky in the area of the
Chaco Culture National Historical Park; and
(B) in 2013, was certified as an Inter-
national Dark Sky Park;
(7) the Greater Chaco landscape in the
State of New Mexico extends beyond Chaco
Culture National Historical Park and encom-
passes—
(A) local communities, including Pueblos
and Indian Tribes; and
(B) public land, which includes additional
cultural resources and sacred sites;
(8) for over 110 years, the Federal Govern-
ment has recognized the importance of the
area in which the Chacoan people lived and
has acted to protect historic and sacred sites
in the area, including—
(A) Chaco Canyon, which was designated as
a National Monument in 1907 and as the
Chaco Culture National Historical Park in
1980;
(B) the Aztec Ruins, which was designated
as a National Monument in 1923 and ex-
panded in each of 1928, 1930, 1948, and 1988;
and
(C) the 39 Chaco Culture Archeological
Protection Sites designated in 1995;
(9) recognizes that the standard for Tribal
consultation is outlined in Executive Order
13175 (25 U.S.C. 5301 note; relating to con-
sultation and coordination with Indian Trib-
al governments);
(10) extensive natural gas development has
occurred in the Greater Chaco region that af-
fect the health, safety, economies, and qual-
ity of life of local communities;
(11) renewed interest in oil exploration and
production within the Mancos/Gallup Shale
play has increased the potential for—
(A) significant impacts on resources and
visitor experiences at the Chaco Culture Na-
tional Historical Park; and
(B) additional impacts on local commu-
nities in the Greater Chaco region, including
Pueblos and Indian Tribes;
(12) a mineral withdrawal in the landscape
around the Chaco Culture National Histor-
ical Park would prevent leasing and develop-
ment in the immediate area surrounding the
Chaco Culture National Historical Park,
which would protect resources and visitor
experiences at the Chaco Culture National
Historical Park; and
(13) additional studies and protective
measures should be undertaken to address
health, safety, and environmental impacts
on communities and interests of Pueblos and
Indian Tribes in the Greater Chaco land-
scape.

AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR. LUJÁN
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 1 printed in part
E of House Report 116–264.
Mr. LUJÁN. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate
the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 6, line 25, insert ‘‘on Federal lands
and of Federal minerals’’ after ‘‘develop-
ment’’.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 656, the gentleman from New
Mexico (Mr. LUJÁN) and a Member op-
posed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New Mexico.
Mr. LUJÁN. Mr. Chairman, I am op-
timistic that this amendment may
even pass on a voice vote because I
have been listening closely to my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle
about the importance of providing
clarifying language to ensure that we
are able to make sure that we are
meeting the goals that we have laid
out.
So I am hopeful, Mr. Chairman, that
this may be a short debate, but one
that will definitely pass and make sure
that we are embracing both sides of the
aisle.
Mr. Chairman, this simple amend-
ment would further clarify that this
proposal only withdraws Federal re-
sources. The withdrawal in H.R. 2181
would not impact nor remove valid ex-
isting rights. This includes any lands
and minerals owned by a Tribe or a
member of a Tribe, including allotment
land, and it will include any valid
rights to lands or minerals held by the
State of New Mexico.
I introduced this bill to prevent fur-
ther encroachment of Federal oil and
gas development on the sacred sites of
the greater Chaco Canyon region.
These sites have withstood the test of
time, 800 A.D. They have stood for
thousands of years and give us a win-
dow into the past.
Yet, every year, oil and gas develop-
ment on Federal lands inch closer and
closer, threatening these sites and
thousands of ancient artifacts within
the region. The Chaco Culture National
Historical Park has significant reli-
gious, cultural, and archaeological
value to the original peoples of the
Southwest.
Under this administration, Chaco
does continue to face greater threats.
Under the Trump administration, the
BLM has proposed to sell leases near
Chaco Canyon three times since March
2018. But I will also give some credit to
the administration. Each time, under
the Trump administration, the sales
were withdrawn by the BLM under the
Department of the Interior after
pushback from the Native American
communities. And each time, the ad-
ministration promised meaningful con-
sultation, which is living up to our
trust responsibility, something that I
shared with my colleague on the other
side of the aisle. Sadly, the meaningful
consultation never took place, yet the
leases were up again for sale only
months later.
It is time for Congress to heed the in-
terest of the communities across New
Mexico that want to see the site pro-
tected and withdraw the Federal lands
and minerals across Chaco Canyon.
As you have seen and heard, 90 per-
cent of the San Juan Basin is already
open to drilling. Oil and gas rights are
not under threat here.
I understand that concerns have been
raised by allottees who worry this bill
will impact their ability to develop
their rights. But as I said earlier, the
bill clearly protects them.
If my colleagues have any concerns,
this amendment provides further clari-
fying language to ensure that those
protections are very clear.
This proposal will not impact any-
one’s ability to develop their valid
rights, including Navajo allottees. This
amendment makes it clear that the
legislation only affects Federal Gov-
ernment land and minerals owned.
Let’s be clear: My legislation sup-
ports the interests of Tribes and their
sovereignty. H.R. 2181 is well-supported
by Native American communities. The
proposal has received the support of
the All Pueblo Council of Governors
representing 20 Pueblos and the Navajo
Nation.
Leaders were at the table for every
step of this process, helping to decide
how these resources should be pro-
tected. I will forever remember the
conversations I had with Navajo elders
and children who continue to share
their concerns associated with pro-
tecting the sacred site.
I will just close, Mr. Chairman, by re-
minding us once again that when we
lay our loved ones to rest, we will do
everything we can to protect those sa-
cred sites. This weekend, I found my-
self next to the Nambe Church in the
community where I live, half a mile
away from where I rest my head, re-
membering those who have fallen,
cleaning those sites, pulling up the
weeds, raking the ground, paying my
respects. I can’t imagine how my mom
or I would feel if those places would be
desecrated.
That is all that we are asking. Let’s
come together. Let’s protect these sa-
cred sites. Let’s do it together.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I rise in oppo-
sition, although I am not opposed to
the amendment.
The CHAIR. Without objection, the
gentleman from Arizona is recognized
for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, when I look
at this, I see the aptitude to try to
amend this to give access. I have to tell
the gentleman, though, it doesn’t go
far enough.
Mr. Chair, I think what we have to do
is guarantee access so that Congress is
specifically and intentionally demand-
ing that they have that access because
you know as well as I know that, once
again, government problems exist. I
will give the gentleman an example.
In the last land package, we have a
land package that included the La Paz

land exchange by BLM. Do you know
what the big problem now has been? It
was signed into law. It has been about
access. Our legislation actually said
that it did not impugn any of the min-
eral estates, but then the BLM came
back and said, listen, that doesn’t
guarantee you access to it.
That is why I think it doesn’t go far
enough.
I would love to see it say that it re-
quires the allottees access to those
lands. But I am not opposed to it. I
think it slightly makes it better.
Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Utah (Mr. BISHOP), the
ranking member of the Committee on
Natural Resources.
Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I,
too, am actually in support of the
amendment. I think it is an improve-
ment on the bill, but it doesn’t go far
enough because it is still only amend-
ing the findings.
If you really want teeth with it, you
have to amend the statutes whatso-
ever. So for that, it is an improvement,
but it still does not solve the base
problem that even if you are taking
away rights on Federal property and
you have private rights that abut it,
that has an impact on those private
rights at the same time.
Those are the types of things that
need to be guaranteed because those
are the people that could be losing tens
of thousands of dollars because the ac-
tion on the Federal land has an impact
on the private land that abuts it at the
same time. And that cannot be solved
in a finding.
However, the language that you put
in here is a good effort to try and at
least clarify what Congress hopes to be
accomplishing. For that, I commend
the gentleman for actually presenting
this particular amendment. I am happy
to be able to vote for it.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I think we
need to devolve this back to the people
of interest, the Native peoples, the peo-
ple of the State, the private owners.
Mr. Chair, I lay no opposition to this
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. LUJÁN. Mr. Chairman, just to
close, I very much appreciate the at-
tention that was brought to section 6
of the amendment, which very clearly
states that nothing in this act, number
one, affects the mineral rights of an In-
dian Tribe or member of an Indian
Tribe to trust land or allotment land;
or, number two, precludes improve-
ments to or rights-of-way for water,
power, or road development under Fed-
eral lands to assist communities adja-
cent to or in the vicinity of the Federal
land.
I very much respect my colleague
and the former chair of the committee,
Mr. BISHOP, and Mr. GOSAR, and I look
forward to continuing to work with
them.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The CHAIR. The question is on the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from New Mexico (Mr. LUJÁN).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MR. GOSAR
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 2 printed in part
E of House Report 116–264.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate
the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 9, beginning on line 8, strike ‘‘TO IN-
DIAN TRIBES’’.
Page 9, line 11, insert ‘‘or a State trust
land entity’’ after ‘‘Indian Tribe’’.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 656, the gentleman from Arizona
(Mr. GOSAR) and a Member opposed
each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Arizona.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, this
amendment would allow Federal lands
included in the withdrawal area to be
conveyed or exchanged with State
trust entities, as well as Native Amer-
ican Tribes.
Currently, over one-third of the land
in New Mexico is owned by the Federal
Government. The 316,000-acre with-
drawal this bill creates includes sub-
stantial parcels of Native American-
owned private land and State trust
lands.
State trust lands are an essential
part of funding public services in the
West, especially education. However,
Federal overreach, such as this legisla-
tion, puts that funding at risk. Allow-
ing the conveyance of certain lands in
the withdrawal to State trust agencies
and private businesses will help to
mitigate the effects of this withdrawal
on essential public services and local
infrastructure.
Allowing the conveyance of federally
held land will also go a long way to ad-
dressing one of the critical problems
with this legislation, which is access.
Denying access to these lands to pri-
vate landowners and Native American
allottees is simply wrong. The growing
Federal estate is not a good thing for
the long-term future of the West.
Instead of locking up more land, like
the majority is trying to do today, we
should be focused on increasing mul-
tiple use on public lands. We can have
our cake, and we can eat it, too.
To put it simply, instead of need-
lessly locking up more land, we should
be focused on unlocking the potential
of the West, empowering people to
enjoy it.
Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to
support this amendment, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. LUJÁN. Mr. Chairman, I claim
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
New Mexico is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
b 1545
Mr. LUJÁN. Mr. Chairman, there is a
little bit of irony on this amendment
that, again, I can’t overlook, and we
raised it a little bit earlier.
The previous debate, which was
around protecting the Grand Canyon,
included an argument from my col-
league that there should be some sup-
port for the Member whose district
that we were debating.
Earlier, the gentleman from Arizona
offered an amendment to an Arizona
public lands bill that would have re-
moved the lands in his district from
the bill. Yet here we have a bill in New
Mexico, in the Third Congressional Dis-
trict that I so proudly represent, which
is supported by the Governor of the
State of New Mexico and by the entire
New Mexico delegation, and the gen-
tleman from Arizona is still trying to
make those changes—changes, I would
offer, that don’t make a bit of dif-
ference when it comes to the sub-
stantive side of the bill.
This amendment would not improve
the bill. In fact, it would make it hard-
er for Tribal communities to protect
the lands this bill was intended to pre-
serve.
The gentleman claims that he wants
to ensure the State has access to the
lands in the withdrawal zone so that
they can potentially earn revenue on
these lands.
Well, there is something that has
happened in the State of New Mexico
over the last many years. In New Mex-
ico, the State Land Office, which has
jurisdiction over these lands, has
placed a moratorium on these lands
within the buffer zone because the
State recognizes the importance of pro-
tecting Chaco Canyon.
It is important that Congress do the
same. We need to recognize that the
importance of these sacred homelands
does not end at the boundaries of the
Chaco Culture National Historical
Park, a claim that was falsely made by
my colleagues earlier today.
The entire greater Chaco region con-
tains discovered and undiscovered cul-
tural resources important to Pueblo
communities, to Tribal communities,
to our brothers and sisters who have a
connection to this region. We need to
create this protection zone to ensure
that these resources are not disturbed
or destroyed by future oil and gas ex-
ploration on Federal lands.
As my colleagues have noted, even
Secretary Bernhardt agrees with this
sentiment. That is the Secretary of the
Interior under the Trump administra-
tion. That is why he and the adminis-
tration worked with U.S. Senator of
New Mexico MARTIN HEINRICH to agree
to a 1-year withdrawal around the
Chaco region to allow Congress to act
on these protections for these sites.
So I want to thank my colleagues for
taking the initiative to act within the
allotted time that was given to us by
the Secretary of the Interior.
This amendment ignores the impor-
tance of these resources, ignores the
desires of the State, and would make it
harder for Native communities to pro-
tect their lands.
Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleagues
for the time today. I encourage my col-
leagues to oppose this amendment, but

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8634 October 30, 2019
I hope to continue to work with my
colleagues in the Congress so we can
get to adoption of this important legis-
lation with as strong a bipartisan vote
as possible.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I am not
from New Mexico, but I do have an in-
terest in education because that was
one of the standard operating proce-
dures that we were promised on public
land.
If I am not mistaken, the Tribes are
beneficiaries, as well, of that edu-
cational fund. And so, when you start
looking at this, depriving that fund of
its due resources—I don’t know about
New Mexico, but Arizona has got a
problem paying for its educational sys-
tem. It is not because we don’t have
enough money; it is because we don’t
have enough land. That is a problem.
I am here on behalf of the bene-
ficiaries that the government prom-
ised. So, from that standpoint, I don’t
see a dichotomy in the argument until
we can understand, until we have a bet-
ter facilitation of that exchange, once
again, doing something expediently, as
we had the discussion earlier about ac-
cess to those allottees.
Once again, government hasn’t been
the solution that it had claimed to be.
We almost have to guide them hand
and foot, pushing them to the right de-
cision.
Mr. Chair, I still rise in favor of this
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The CHAIR. The question is on the

The question was taken; and the

E of House Report 116–264.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate
the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of the bill, insert the following:
SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act shall take effect on the date that
the Secretary of the Interior finds that the
withdrawal under section 4 shall not impact
the ability to develop or the economic value
of the mineral rights held by Native Ameri-
cans in the Chaco Cultural Heritage With-
drawal Area or the greater Chaco region.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 656, the gentleman from Arizona
(Mr. GOSAR) and a Member opposed
each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Arizona.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, this
amendment would ensure this bill
would not take effect if the withdrawal
in question is proven to affect develop-
ment or economic value of Native
American mineral rights on allot-
ments.
Private property rights are a funda-
mental American ideal. The 316,000-
acre withdrawal this bill creates in-
cludes substantial parcels of privately
held land, much of which is owned by
Native American allottees.
The benefits of owning mineral rights
are obvious for Native communities. In
2015 alone, the Federal Indian Mineral
Office distributed $96 million to more
than 20,000 allottees around the coun-
try.
At the June 5, 2019, hearing on H.R.
2181, the Committee on Natural Re-
sources heard testimony from Delora
Hesuse, a citizen of the Navajo Nation,
Nageezi chapter, and a Navajo allottee,
who owns mineral resources in the pro-
posed area.
Ms. Hesuse testified that H.R. 2181
would ‘‘put many of our mineral rights
off limits and stop a much-needed
source of income to feed, shelter,
clothe, and protect our families.’’
Apparently, the voices of Ms. Hesuse
and other allottees who have spoken to
the committee have not been heard.
This amendment is an effort to ac-
knowledge that their livelihoods could
be drastically diminished by this legis-
lation.
I ask the Members of this body to put
themselves in the shoes of the Native
American allottees who have staked
their livelihood on the mineral rights
on their properties that are rightfully
theirs, only to have the Federal Gov-
ernment strip them of their rights. I
believe that is an injustice.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Chair, I rise in
opposition to this amendment.
The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from
New Mexico is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Chair, I strongly
oppose this amendment because it
would allow Secretary Bernhardt to
kill this bill, preventing protections
for the important cultural sites at
Chaco Canyon.
In response to this amendment, I
would point you to the text of H.R.
2181. The bill text states: ‘‘Nothing in
this act affects the mineral rights of an
Indian Tribe or member of an Indian
Tribe or trust land or allotment land.’’
It could not be any clearer than that;
yet we have had this debate in hear-
ings, in markups, and even moments
ago during debate and in amendments.
I understand and appreciate the con-
cerns of the Navajo allottees, and I ap-
preciated when Ms. Hesuse came before
our committee to share her concerns
with us. It is important that we take
these perspectives into consideration,
which is why I appreciate Representa-
tive LUJÁN’s effort to make explicitly
clear that this bill will have no impact
on the rights of allotted owners.
But, at the same time, we need to lis-
ten to the voices of Native commu-
nities and their elected leaders, who
are calling on us to protect Chaco Can-
yon.
We have heard it already today, but
this bill receives the complete support
of the Navajo Nation and the All Pueb-
lo Council of Governors, which rep-
resents 19 pueblos in New Mexico and 1
in Texas.
These Tribal leaders want to see the
Chaco landscape protected from oil and
gas drilling. They don’t want to see
cultural sites damaged by pump jacks
or to have the pollution of extraction
intrude on these sacred sites.
The restrictions in this proposal are
not new. They have been informally in
place for years under the Obama ad-
ministration without any clear impact
on any allottees.
We need to act now to formalize
these protections because the Trump
administration and their energy domi-
nance agenda threaten these important
resources. Lease sales have been of-
fered around Chaco Canyon three times
since March of 2018.
We must listen to the voices of Tribal
communities and protect Chaco Can-
yon.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
vote against this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I would
have loved to hear that argument in
the discussion on ANWR. That would
have been interesting to have.
When I look at this, it has become
very evident, in my time here in Con-
gress, to find programs that had no au-
thorization by Congress that were en-
acted. Interesting. Interesting, once
again, in a government that is not
trusted.
Trust is a series of promises kept.
Once again, this reiterates the private
property ownership of these allottees
to make sure that it is not impugned.
I do not see the definition of that caus-
ing a quandary.
Once again, these are allottees who
are deserving for us to require to make
sure that they are held whole.
So, once again, I find it shortsighted
in the application that the other side
doesn’t want to accept this amend-
ment.
Mr. Chair, I wish everyone would
vote for this amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Chair, we have
heard this argument. We have hashed
and rehashed it over and over again.
Not only that, but my colleague, Mr.
LUJÁN, said it very plainly: The
allottees will not be hampered by H.R.
2181.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
vote against this amendment, and I
yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Chairman, I

The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of the bill, add the following:
SEC. 7. CONTINUING OPERATIONS.
Operators may continue new oil and gas
developments in the exclusionary zone pro-
posed by this Act if those operators have pre-
viously been in accordance with the provi-
sions of law formerly known as the ‘‘Na-
tional Historic Preservation Act’’ and have
not violated the existing rules and regula-
tions for the archeological sites and areas of
sensitivity in the Chaco Canyon Historical
Park.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 656, the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. ARRINGTON) and a Member opposed
each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Texas.
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Chairman,
there is a Navajo saying that a rocky
vineyard does not need a prayer but a
pickax.
We don’t need protectionist prayers
from elites in Washington who think
they have all the answers; we need a
pickax for prosperity and opportunity
for folks living in rural America and
the Navajo people in New Mexico.
Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an
amendment to H.R. 2181, the Chaco
Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act.
My amendment would prevent the
proposed ban on future oil and gas de-
velopment from going into effect in an
area that already has adequate protec-
tions, protections that are there to en-
sure that these operations won’t have
any adverse impact on historic and sa-
cred lands in the Chaco Canyon His-
toric Park.
The reality is there are already a lit-
any of State and Federal laws in place
to ensure environmental protection
and to prevent mineral development
from affecting sensitive infrastructure
and sacred artifacts within this exclu-
sion zone.
Energy companies have had a posi-
tive track record when it comes to
working with the Federal Government
to comply with these laws for nec-
essary permits and approvals. And,
since producers already meet the
standards set in several comprehensive
environmental laws, this proposed ban
on new oil and gas development in this
area, in my opinion, is unnecessary, is
misguided, and is overreaching.
In fact, drilling for minerals already
prohibited within the Chaco Canyon
Historic Park, keeping the culturally
sensitive artifacts safe from any sort of
potential disturbance caused by oil and
gas development, this bill is nothing
more than a buffer zone on top of an al-
ready existing buffer zone that has pro-
tected cultural artifacts effectively for
100 years, Mr. Chairman.
b 1600
Unfortunately, if enacted, this bill
would create significant access and ex-
traction complications for the Navajos.
This adverse impact would be a result
of the checkerboard nature of the min-
eral rights and how Federal, State,
Tribal, and private lands are inter-
secting.
Even though the area is proven to
house abundant oil and gas reserves,
the restrictions on accessing Federal
land would make doing business in that
area almost impossible, leading to a de
facto extraction ban on the Navajo’s
privately-owned mineral rights. The
so-called buffer zone imposed by the
bill is arbitrary and completely unnec-
essary, again, in my opinion.
The whole purpose of establishing the
Chaco Culture National Historical
Park was to protect every area of his-
toric significance and, again, it has
worked for a century now. That goal
has already been achieved. The protec-
tion is already ensured. Extending the
boundaries and adding acreage to the
heritage area will not enhance protec-
tion of areas of historical significance,
but instead, will limit the potential of
private landowners to steward and reap
the rewards of their privately held land
passed down to them from their ances-
tors.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.

Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I strongly oppose this amendment be-
cause it would negate the withdrawal.
It would prevent us from protecting
Chaco Canyon. The gentleman’s
amendment would allow for new drill-
ing to occur on lands within the with-
drawal area, so long as certain stand-
ards are met. Essentially, this amend-
ment would protect the status quo, a
status quo opposed by the All Pueblo
Council of Governors, the Navajo Na-
tion, the entire New Mexico delegation,
the governor, and even the administra-
tion.
When Secretary Bernhardt visited
Chaco last spring, he agreed to a 1-year
moratorium because he knew that new
drilling posed a threat to these sacred
resources. Now this amendment seeks
to overturn those temporary protec-
tions offered by the Trump administra-
tion and to prevent permanent protec-
tions from being enacted. That cannot
stand.
Furthermore, this amendment con-
tains numerous drafting edits that
would make it impossible to enact. It
names the park site incorrectly. It re-
fers to undefined terms. And its un-
clear wording would essentially allow
anyone to drill in the withdrawal area.
This is clearly not a good faith
amendment, and it is clearly not an
amendment intended to improve this
proposal. It is simply an attempt to
open these sacred lands with resources
that extend beyond the park to extrac-
tion, because some of our colleagues
cannot be satisfied until every acre of
land in this country has an oil rig or an
open pit mine.
Ninety percent of this region is al-
ready open to leasing. Oil and gas are
not under attack in New Mexico. This
bill simply attempts to protect an area
important to the Tribal communities
who have connections to this land that
go back thousands of years before this
country even existed.
We have to believe, as a House, that
some places have value beyond what
can be drilled from a hole in the
ground. And believe it or not, some
things in this world are more impor-
tant than money. Is there nothing that
matters more than industry profits?
These are sacred lands, lands that con-
nect us to the past and lands that na-
tive communities are asking us to pro-
tect. The bones of my ancestors are
buried there in its hallowed ground.
We need to listen to the voices of the
people whose land it belongs to and
who have had it since time immemo-
rial. We need to lift up those voices and
we need to protect Chaco Canyon.
I encourage my colleagues to oppose
this amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Private property rights are a corner-
stone of our democracy and our free so-
ciety. That doesn’t just extend to folks
in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma. It
extends to all Americans and our Trib-
al brothers and sisters. One of them
who testified at one of the hearings,
who is a member of the Navajo Nation,
said that this is a steadfast personal
property right that sustains our liveli-
hoods and our way of life. This is a
much-needed source of income to feed,
shelter, clothe, and protect our fami-
lies.
Mr. Chairman, this is unnecessary.
This is one of those times where Wash-
ington thinks it has the solution,
where we sit in our ivory tower and
dictate the terms to folks living in
rural communities in New Mexico and
throughout the country, folks that de-
pend on these energy jobs for their
livelihoods, and I just trust that the
local community and the great State of
New Mexico knows best how to manage
their resources.
This is not disturbing any sacred
land or historic artifacts. That is not
what this is about. This is about a pro-
tectionist, activist view to ban drilling,
in my opinion. And the State of New

Mexico is incredibly dependent on the
oil and gas revenues, Mr. Chairman. A
third of their budget, Mr. Chairman, is
reliant on oil and gas royalties.
I encourage my colleagues to support
this amendment. I think it is critical
to make sure that our colleagues know
that Washington doesn’t have the solu-
tions.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Chairman, I
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from
New Mexico (Mr. LUJÁN).
Mr. LUJÁN. Mr. Chairman, I listened
closely to the words of my colleague on
the other side of the aisle and, Mr.
Chairman, he said something that mat-
ters very much to me as well: That
New Mexico knows best. New Mexico
knows best.
The governor of the State of New
Mexico, the State land commissioner,
the entire delegation supports this leg-
islation. So I am hoping we will earn
the vote of my colleague from the
other side of the aisle on final adop-
tion, so he can join with the good peo-
ple of New Mexico and support the bill.
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Chairman, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
This legislation, H.R. 2181, is abso-
lutely necessary to protect the land of
my ancestors and the land of New Mex-
ico. We oppose this amendment.
I encourage my colleagues to oppose
this amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The CHAIR. The question is on the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON).
The question was taken; and the
Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Chairman, I
demand a recorded vote.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of
rule XVIII, further proceedings on the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from Texas will be postponed.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE ACTING CHAIR
The Acting CHAIR (during the vote).
There is 1 minute remaining.
b 1651
So the amendment was rejected.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. BEYER).
There being no further amendments
under the rule, the Committee rises.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. KIL-
DEE) having assumed the chair, Mr.
BEYER, Acting Chair of the Committee
of the Whole House on the state of the
Union, reported that that Committee,
having had under consideration the bill
(H.R. 2181) to provide for the with-
drawal and protection of certain Fed-
eral land in the State of New Mexico,
and, pursuant to House Resolution 656,
reported the bill, as amended by that
resolution, back to the House with a
further amendment adopted in the
Committee of the Whole.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the rule, the previous question is or-
dered.
The question is on the amendment.
The amendment was agreed to.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the engrossment and
third reading of the bill.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed
and read a third time, and was read the
third time.
MOTION TO RECOMMIT
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I
have a motion to recommit at the
desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the
gentleman opposed to the bill?
Mr. ARRINGTON. Yes, in its current
form.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit.
The Clerk read as follows:
Mr. Arrington moves to recommit the bill
H.R. 2181 to the Committee on Natural Re-
sources with instructions to report the same
back to the House forthwith with the fol-
lowing amendment:
At the end of the bill, add the following:
SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act shall not go into effect if the Sec-
retary of the Interior, in consultation with
the Governor of New Mexico, determines
that the State of New Mexico will suffer a
loss of revenue, including revenues used to
fund schools, roads, fire and police protec-
tion and other public services, attributed to
the permanent withdrawal under section 4 of
this Act.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
Texas is recognized for 5 minutes in
support of his motion.
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, at
the heart of America’s economic pros-
perity and unrivaled security is an
abundant, affordable, and reliable sup-
ply of domestic energy. American en-
ergy independence is, undoubtedly, a
matter of national security, but it is
also a question of life and death to
many rural economies.
In west Texas, and for my neighbors
in eastern New Mexico, energy pro-
ducers are as crucial to our commu-
nities as educators, healthcare pro-
viders, and agricultural producers. Tra-
ditional sources of energy make up 90
percent of our Nation’s energy supply
and support over 10 million jobs in this
great country.
In New Mexico alone, Mr. Speaker,
more than 100,000 jobs are oil and gas
related. A whopping one-third of the
State’s budget comes from oil and gas
revenues. That is over $2 billion, half of
which supports funding public edu-
cation.
Thousands of Navajo landowners re-
ceive millions of dollars every year
from oil and gas royalties. Putting a
permanent ban on any future mineral
development outside the National Park
would be devastating for local econo-
mies, the Navajo people, and the entire
State of New Mexico.
Therefore, my motion to recommit
will prevent this legislation from tak-
ing effect until it is confirmed that
New Mexico will not suffer this severe
economic harm resulting in a loss of
revenue. That is revenue used to fund
schools, roads, hospitals, and other im-
portant public services.
Mr. Speaker, while this bill claims
not to infringe on the private property
rights of the Navajo people, the reality
is that many of their lands are sur-
rounded by Federal lands, making it
virtually impossible to develop if this
legislation were to pass.
H.R. 2181, let’s be clear, would elimi-
nate key revenue sources used for pub-
lic services. It would destroy jobs and
economic activity there in New Mexico
and, ultimately, threaten the liveli-
hood of the Navajo people.
This, Mr. Speaker, in my opinion,
would be an absolute travesty for the
Navajo people because the poverty rate
in the Navajo Nation is more than
three times the national average,
about 38 percent. The unemployment
rate is more than five times the na-
tional average, 20-plus percent. Almost
half of all Navajo children live in pov-
erty.
Oil- and gas-related employment is
critical to jobs and income in these iso-
lated areas where the Navajo people
live. It is unconscionable, Mr. Speaker,
that a handful of activists should be
able to deprive the Navajo Nation of
opportunities to find work, opportuni-
ties to lease their own mineral rights,
and opportunities to lift themselves up
out of poverty by reaping the benefits
of their own land.
Mr. Speaker, there is an old Navajo
saying: ‘‘A rocky vineyard does not
need a prayer, but a pickax.’’
The Navajo people don’t need more
protectionists’ prayers from Wash-
ington elite and environmental activ-
ists. They need the pickax of pros-
perity and opportunity that comes
from freedom, and the ability to man-
age their own private property rights
and their own private mineral rights.
The Navajo people are a proud peo-
ple, just like all Americans, and they
just want an opportunity for a better
life for themselves and their families.
Mr. Speaker, this is a classic case of
a solution looking for a problem. I ask
my colleagues to support this motion
to recommit and vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R.
2181.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Speaker, I claim
the time in opposition to this motion
to recommit.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from New Mexico is recog-
nized for 5 minutes.
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Speaker, this
amendment is just another attempt to
distract from the importance of this
proposal, which is listening to Tribal
voices by protecting the sacred sites of
Chaco Canyon from oil and gas extrac-
tion.
The bill would not impact New Mex-
ico revenue streams in the slightest.
The State has already withdrawn State
lands in Chaco and opted to protect our
indigenous lands, because they also
recognize the value of our outdoor
economy which requires a clean envi-
ronment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8639
October 30, 2019
The bill would not impact the New
Mexico revenue streams in the slight-
est. This country is the largest pro-
ducer of oil and gas in the world. We
produce over 12 million barrels of crude
oil a day, sending 3 million of those to
other countries.
Lack of access to oil and gas is not
an issue in New Mexico, and this bill
will in no way hinder the tremendous
amount of energy extraction in the
State. Between 2010 and 2018, oil pro-
duction in New Mexico increased by
nearly 400 percent, and the State is
now the third largest producer in the
Nation after Texas and North Dakota.
In the San Juan Basin where Chaco
Canyon is located, 90 percent of public
land is already open to development.
Must every inch of land be swallowed
by oil and gas-sucking machinery?
Thousands of sacred ancestral sites
to the Pueblo people are sites where In-
dians are under threat unless we act.
Tribes across New Mexico and this
country have asked this body to pro-
tect Chaco Canyon. We shouldn’t put
the sacred sites of Chaco Canyon and
our environment at risk on the impos-
sible theory that we can become energy
dominant or that we need to open
every single acre to oil and gas devel-
opment regardless of how special that
land is.
If we really want to lead in energy,
we should take a larger role in renew-
able energy and low-carbon energy
sources, and New Mexico can lead the
way with our 300 days of sun per year
and our abundance of wind.
Unfortunately, the Trump adminis-
tration prioritizes fossil fuels and be-
lieves the future lies in coal, oil, and
gas. But the President is wrong, and
Republicans are wrong. The world’s
power sources are changing, and no one
stands to benefit more from U.S. lead-
ership during this transition than
American consumers.
The only question that remains is
whether this body will help lead our
Nation in implementing a modern,
clean energy agenda or whether we will
remain stuck in the past, holding on to
the 1950s like there is no future to be-
lieve in.
Now is not the time to open our pro-
tected public lands up to unnecessary
oil and gas extraction. Now is the time
to protect these important places and
to lift up the voices of communities on
the ground.
Some things are more important
than money, and my ancestral home-
land most definitely is.
I urge my colleagues to oppose this
motion to recommit and support this
bill that would protect the sacred lands
in New Mexico and that is Chaco Can-
yon.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit.
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion to recommit.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the noes appeared to have it.
RECORDED VOTE
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I de-
mand a recorded vote.
A recorded vote was ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair
will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum
time for any electronic vote on the
question of passage.
This is a 5-minute vote.

vice, and there were—ayes 199, noes 222,

PERSONAL EXPLANATION
Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chair, I was unavoidably de-
tained in a meeting discussing the lack of di-
versity in media. Had I been present, I would
have voted ‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 599 and
‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 600.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. BEYER). The
question is on the committee amend-
ment in the nature of a substitute.
The amendment was agreed to.
The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule,
the Committee rises.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. KIL-
DEE) having assumed the chair, Mr.
BEYER, Acting Chair of the Committee
of the Whole House on the state of the
Union, reported that that Committee,
having had under consideration the bill
(H.R. 1373) to protect, for current and
future generations, the watershed, eco-
system, and cultural heritage of the
Grand Canyon region in the State of
Arizona, and for other purposes, and,
pursuant to House Resolution 656, he
reported the bill back to the House
with an amendment adopted in the
Committee of the Whole.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the rule, the previous question is or-
dered.
The question is on the committee
amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute.
The amendment was agreed to.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the engrossment and
third reading of the bill.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed

third time.
MOTION TO RECOMMIT
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have a
motion to recommit at the desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the
gentleman opposed to the bill?
Mr. WITTMAN. Yes, in its current
form.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8643
October 30, 2019
At the end of the bill, add the following:
SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act shall not be effective until the
Secretary of the Interior, in consultation
with appropriate entities, issues a report
concluding that the withdrawal under sec-
tion 2 will not result in increased mineral
imports from Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbek-
istan, and Namibia.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes in
support of his motion.
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, ura-
nium is essential to both our national
security and energy security. It sup-
plies many critical military tech-
nologies and fuels our domestic nuclear
reactors, which provide 20 percent of
our Nation’s electricity.
Early this summer, Secretary of
Commerce Wilbur Ross issued findings
that concluded ‘‘uranium is being im-
ported into the United States in such
quantities and under such cir-
cumstances as to threaten to impair
the national security of the United
States.’’
Most recently, President Trump
agreed, saying ‘‘that the United States
uranium industry faces significant
challenges in producing uranium do-
mestically and that this is an issue of
national security.’’
This bill would have a negative im-
pact on our national security and en-
ergy security, as it aims to perma-
nently prohibit the mining of rare
earths and critical minerals on over 1
million acres of public land, increasing
our dependence on imported foreign
sources of uranium.
My motion to recommit would delay
the implementation of this legislation
until the Secretary of the Interior
issues a report concluding that this
permanent, million-acre withdrawal of
lands from mineral development will
not increase U.S. imports of critical
minerals like uranium from countries
hostile to the United States’ inter-
ests—countries like former Soviet
Union bloc countries or Namibia,
where the Chinese have taken control
of uranium mines.
Increasingly, our adversaries like
China and Russia are competing for
natural resources and using them as
proxies to extend their political and
strategic aims.
The U.S. is losing our domestic ura-
nium production capacity and becom-
ing more reliant on uranium imports
from countries that do not have our
best interests in mind, and this bill
would only exacerbate the problem.
In 2018, 97 percent of U.S. demand for
uranium was met by foreign imports.
At least 51 percent of those uranium
imports were sourced from countries
that are unfriendly to the United
States, including Russia, Kazakhstan,
Uzbekistan, and Chinese-owned mines
in Namibia.
In the past, we have been able to rely
on friendly countries for these re-
sources. Unfortunately, uranium im-
ports from Australia and Canada have
been declining in recent years. Cur-
rently, only one Canadian mine re-
mains operational, creating an increas-
ingly fragile supply chain. As a result,
we are becoming more dependent on
China and Russia for critical natural
resources.
I have dedicated my time on the
Armed Services Committee to main-
taining a strong defense industrial base
in the face of increased near-peer com-
petition from China and Russia. These
adversaries are weaponizing natural re-
sources like uranium to implement a
dedicated strategy that advances their
geopolitical aims while undermining
our own.
We should not allow our adversaries
to dominate the mining, production,
and markets of these critical resources.
If we do, we weaken our position and
are subject to increased economic and
military pressure from Beijing and
Moscow.
It would be shortsighted to perma-
nently lock away the highest grade and
largest deposit of uranium in this
country. Instead of rushing headlong
into permanently restricting 1 million
acres of uranium-rich land, we abso-
lutely must understand the true im-
pacts of this legislation and the long-
term, true impacts on the national se-
curity of our country.
Mr. Speaker, we can do both. We can
conserve our natural resources and
make sure we protect our national se-
curity. To do anything less is an aban-
donment of our responsibilities.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support our national security, support
this motion to recommit, and vote
against H.R. 1373.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise
in opposition to the motion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Arizona is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I un-
derstand the gentleman’s concerns, I
really do. Hostile nations like Russia
have shown their true face by inter-
fering in our elections and continuing
to attempt to influence the results of
an American election.
Although it is hard to take my col-
league seriously on this concern when
members of his own party and the
President refuse to acknowledge what
the intelligence community and mil-
lions upon millions of Americans al-
ready know, Russia interfered in the
2016 election.
But let’s be clear about the true in-
tent of this motion. What the gen-
tleman has put forward will kill this
bill, opening a pathway for uranium
mining in the Grand Canyon. Instead,
they seem to think that the real threat
to our national security is that Demo-
crats aren’t willing to mine uranium in
the Grand Canyon. And make no mis-
take, this is what they are supporting
when they vote against this bill or this
procedural motion. This is not theo-
retical.
The Grand Canyon, and I will say it
again, the Grand Canyon is under
threat from uranium mining, and my
colleagues across the aisle are per-
fectly willing to let it happen. We don’t
need to open up the Grand Canyon to
uranium mining to meet our national
security or energy needs. The region
that is being designated for permanent
withdrawal holds less than 1 percent of
known U.S. reserves of uranium.
Meanwhile, we get the majority of
our uranium from domestic mining or
from our closest allies, Australia and
Canada. The Department of Defense
has testified that we have enough ura-
nium stockpiled to meet national secu-
rity needs for decades to come. And we
stockpile enough uranium to run reac-
tors for years without importing a sin-
gle pound.
I could rattle off the facts all day
about how nonsensical this motion is
and how ridiculous an argument our
colleagues are making. I can share let-
ters from national security experts
breaking down their concerns about
the need to protect the Grand Canyon
from further uranium mining. I could
even show you data from the Heritage
Foundation, a known friend of our col-
leagues, showing the Republican argu-
ments about uranium security are,
here in Heritage’s words, ‘‘a hollow
Russian doll.’’
But at the end of the day, we can’t
lose sight of what this is really about.
Our colleagues want to see the Grand
Canyon, one of the most American of
American landscapes open to uranium
mining. They want to block this bill.
They want to stop this place from
being permanently protected, so that a
very few wealthy companies can open
up mine shafts and pull uranium out of
the Grand Canyon and leave the mess
to the taxpayers to clean up.
We don’t need this uranium in the
designated area. It is expensive to ex-
tract. It risks our clean water and
threatens our Tribal communities.
On that point, the threat to Tribal
communities is based in a legacy of
antihistory, a legacy of illness, a leg-
acy of high levels of contamination
among Navajo people in the area in the
Navajo Nation. It is based on lost land
and soil-contaminated land, and it is
based upon contaminated water. That
is the legacy around the Grand Canyon
to the people and the environment
around there. It is a legacy that has
united Indian Country in support of
permanent protection for the Grand
Canyon, and we should respect that
voice. It is a voice that has been clear
about the importance, not only of the
Grand Canyon as a cultural resource,
but the Grand Canyon as a resource of
water for 40 million people in this
country.
We don’t need this uranium. As I
said, it is, frankly, hard for me to
imagine a more cynical move than to
continue to mine in the Grand Canyon.
They are willing to use misinformation
to ignore the people of Arizona and the
United States and to threaten one of
the most iconic landmarks just to open
up a few acres for extraction.

H8644 October 30, 2019
So I ask my colleagues here today, if
the Grand Canyon isn’t worth pro-
tecting, what is? What are we doing
here if we are willing to let public
lands owned and cherished by all Amer-
icans get sold to the highest bidder?
This really shouldn’t be up for debate.
After all, my friends and colleagues, it
is the Grand Canyon. We owe it to our-
selves, we owe it to generations to
come to do our part to permanently
protect the Grand Canyon, and in pro-
tecting the Grand Canyon respect Na-
tive communities that came to us and
said we need this, we need it for our
lives, and we need it for the genera-
tions to come.
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the motion to
recommit, and I yield back the balance
of my time.

dered on the motion to recommit.

ant to House Resolution 656 and rule
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in

b 1805
IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
consideration of the bill (H.R. 823) to
provide for the designation of certain
wilderness areas, recreation manage-
ment areas, and conservation areas in
the State of Colorado, and for other
purposes, with Mrs. MURPHY of Florida
in the chair.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the
bill is considered read the first time.
General debate shall be confined to
the bill and amendments specified in
the first section of House Resolution
656 and shall not exceed 1 hour equally
divided and controlled by the chair and
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources.
The gentleman from Colorado (Mr.
NEGUSE) and the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. LAMBORN) each will control
30 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE).
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, I would first like to
thank Chairman GRIJALVA and Chair-
woman HAALAND for their support and
advocacy of this bill.
I stand today in support of my bill,
H.R. 823, the Colorado Outdoor Recre-
ation and Economy Act, or the CORE
Act.
As Representatives for the people, as
legislators here in the Halls of Con-
gress, our job is to fight for common-
sense solutions that come directly
from our communities.
When our constituents raise their
voices on issues that impact them, and
when we are able to respond with legis-
lation that benefits our districts and
our State, that is when our work is
most effective.
I am proud that the CORE Act was
crafted by Coloradans over the last
decade. It is a product of collaboration,
careful consultation, and negotiation.
Local elected officials, community
members, businesses, outdoor recre-
ation and conservation groups, ranch-
ers, sportsmen, they have all contrib-
uted their input and their passion for
the outdoor areas that they love.
Each title in this bill has been care-
fully vetted by a thoughtful group of
local elected leaders and community
members, and each title is well deserv-
ing of consideration on the House floor
today.
I will just give a brief overview of the
bill.
The CORE Act would conserve over
400,000 acres of public land, and it con-
sists of four titles that Coloradans
have been asking Congress to pass, as I
said, for well over a decade.
Title 1 is the Continental Divide
Recreation, Wilderness and Camp Hale
Legacy Act. It establishes permanent
protections for nearly 100,000 acres of
wilderness, recreation, and conserva-
tion areas in the White River National
Forest along Colorado’s Continental
Divide.
The title creates two new wildlife
conservation areas, totaling approxi-
mately 12,000 acres. The Porcupine
Gulch Wildlife Conservation Area
would protect Colorado’s only migra-
tion corridor over Interstate 70 for elk,
bear, mule, deer, and other wildlife.
The Williams Fork Wildlife Conserva-
tion Area would also enhance wildlife
habitat for the greater sage grouse and
other species.
Title 1 also designates the first-ever
national historic landscape at Camp
Hale. This unprecedented designation
speaks to the storied legacy of the
Army’s 10th Mountain Division in Col-
orado and around the world. As my col-
leagues may know, the soldiers that
trained at Camp Hale led our Nation to
victory in World War II and then went
on to create the outdoor recreation in-
dustry as we know it today.
The second title is the San Juan
Mountains Wilderness Act. This title,
which has previously received bipar-
tisan support in both the House and the
Senate, provides permanent protec-
tions for nearly 61,000 acres of land lo-
cated in the heart of the San Juan
Mountains in southwest Colorado. It
designates some of the State’s most
iconic peaks as wilderness, including

two fourteeners, Mount Sneffels and
Wilson Peak.
The third title is the Thompson Di-
vide Withdrawal and Protection Act,
which prevents new oil and gas devel-
opment in one of Colorado’s most
treasured landscapes while also pro-
tecting private property rights. The
Thompson Divide, through ranching
and outdoor recreation, contributes $30
million a year to the statewide econ-
omy. It is an area that is simply too
valuable to drill for oil and gas.
This title also includes a pilot pro-
gram to allow the capture of fugitive
methane from both active and inactive
coal mines in portions of Pitkin, Delta,
Gunnison, and Garfield Counties.
Madam Chair, this is a point that is
worth underscoring. This provision
that I mentioned was developed at the
request of local elected leaders. Ulti-
mately, I am thankful for their
thoughtful input to improve the bill.
The fourth and final title formally
establishes the boundary for the
Curecanti National Recreation Area,
currently one of only a handful of Na-
tional Park Service units without a
formal designation by an act of Con-
gress. This special place consists of
three reservoirs that are a designation
for boating, fishing, hiking, and camp-
ing. It is a long-overdue formal des-
ignation that will allow the National
Park Service to more effectively man-
age the area, and it also will help en-
sure that the Federal Government lives
up to a longstanding commitment it
made to the State of Colorado to pro-
vide new fishing access for sportsmen
in the Gunnison River basin.
Finally, I would like to call out an
important addition to this bill that
was included in the manager’s amend-
ment to honor the life of an out-
standing individual who was truly
loved by his family and friends, and he
served as a pillar of his community.
Sanford Morris Treat, Jr., who went by
the name ‘‘Sandy,’’ was a World War II
veteran who served in the 10th Moun-
tain Division and trained at Camp
Hale.
I had the honor of meeting Sandy be-
fore his passing earlier this year, and it
is due to his and his fellow veterans’
unwavering advocacy that Camp Hale
would be forever maintained as a Na-
tional Historic Landscape under the
CORE Act. Therefore, the manager’s
amendment includes language to des-
ignate the Sandy Treat Overlook as an
interpretive site overlooking Camp
Hale.
It is my hope that those who visit it
will be reminded of his service to our
country, his zest for life, and his pas-
sion for protecting the legacy of Camp
Hale.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues,
respectfully, to support the CORE Act,
not only to honor those who came be-
fore us, but also to protect our treas-
ured places for generations to come.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Chairman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to
H.R. 823, a bill that creates land re-
strictions for approximately 400,000
acres of land in Colorado in the form of
new wilderness, permanent mineral
withdrawals, as well as recreation and
conservation areas.
While the goals of the public lands
legislation in this bill are certainly ad-
mirable and well-intended, and I have
great respect for the bill’s sponsor, my
friend and fellow Coloradan, Congress-
man NEGUSE, it is clear that this pro-
posal lacks the type of local consensus
required for a bill of this scale.
I am proud to call Colorado home,
and I am honored to represent the
Fifth District of Colorado. I truly be-
lieve our State is the most beautiful in
the Union, and myself and the bill’s
sponsor and other Representatives
from Colorado that you will hear from
during our debate would agree with me
on that. We love our State, and we are
very proud of it.
As is the case for most Western
States, Colorado has a large amount of
public lands, with roughly one-third of
the State under Federal management.
These rich and diverse public lands pro-
vide countless outdoor recreation op-
portunities, habitat for wildlife, and
significant economic benefits for our
rural communities and our State as a
whole.
Because of these diverse uses of our
public lands, it is vital that the land
management decisions we make find
balance and common ground. I regret
to say today that this bill before us
falls short on both counts.
To put the enormity of this bill into
perspective, Madam Chairman, this bill
affects a total acreage that is nine
times the size of Washington, D.C. A
bill of this magnitude should not be
forced through along partisan party
lines, yet that is what we are facing
today.
Public lands decisions should be
made with local collaboration and
input. They have real consequences for
communities on the ground who live
near these public lands.
It is troubling to note that 65 percent
of the lands affected by the bill before
us are located in Congressman TIPTON’s
district. Not only was Mr. TIPTON not
meaningfully consulted on this legisla-
tion, but he was not even made aware
of it until the day that it was publicly
announced.
It is not against the law to write bills
affecting other people’s districts, but I
think that consensus and collaboration
require that they should be brought
into the loop and be part of the proc-
ess.
Subsequent efforts to engage on this
legislation and find compromise have
been largely ignored. That lack of en-
gagement sadly continues today.
b 1815
Mr. TIPTON, for instance, offered 10
good faith amendments that raised spe-
cific concerns that his constituents
have brought to him concerning this
bill. Only three of these were made in
order by the Democrat-controlled
Rules Committee.
Substantial stakeholder concerns
about this bill have been raised by im-
pacted counties, recreation groups, for-
estry health advocates, as well as the
relevant Federal agencies.
One particularly worrying concern
has been raised by the National Guard
Bureau—not the State, but the na-
tional National Guard Bureau—about
this bill’s impact on the Colorado
Army National Guard’s High Altitude
Aviation Training Site, or HAATS,
that has yet to be resolved.
Proposed wilderness expansions in
Colorado around the Colorado Army
National Guard’s HAATS, or High Alti-
tude Aviation Training Site, are cre-
ating concerns about the future of the
site’s ability to ensure military readi-
ness for the men and women who may
be deployed to combat zones in the
Middle East.
This HAATS site is a treasure. It is
the only place in the country where
high-altitude rotary-wing aircraft can
get the training in real-life conditions
that they will encounter overseas in
places like Afghanistan or training for
search and rescue in mountainous
areas around the country or around the
world.
So this is a treasure. It is a unique
site that must be protected. And it is a
collection of sites. It is not just one
landing zone. It is a multitude of land-
ing zones.
While the sponsors of the CORE Act
have indicated that their goal is to pro-
tect HAATS, the only way to provide
certainty for HAATS is to codify the
existing Department of Defense guid-
ance for aircraft flying over Colorado
wilderness areas.
As with any compromise, balance is
key. There is no room for winner-take-
all mentalities if you want to achieve
lasting public land management agree-
ments. This bill, unfortunately, has
chosen a winner-take-all path that
may deliver some great press releases
momentarily but will ultimately fall
short of becoming law. I believe this
bill will not be supported in the other
body and is certainly not supported by
the administration.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, with great respect for
my colleague from Colorado Springs,
whom I certainly enjoy serving with, I
would just say that local community
support is so critical on public lands
bills of this nature. That is why I am so
proud that this bill has overwhelming
support from the local communities
that are impacted by it.
One thing, I suspect, that you will
not hear from my distinguished col-
leagues on this side of the aisle is a ref-
erence to any counties, cities, or towns
directly impacted by this bill that ulti-
mately don’t support it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8647
October 30, 2019
Just to give you a sense of some of
those communities, the town of
Crested Butte, the town of Carbondale,
the city of Glenwood Springs, the town
of Telluride, the town of Basalt, the
town of Breckenridge, the town of
Ophir, the town of Ridgway, the town
of Mountain Village, the town of
Snowmass Village, the town of Frisco,
and the town of Dillon, they have all
supported this bill.
Garfield County supports a provision
of the bill which impacts its county.
San Miguel County does the same.
Gunnison County, Eagle County, San
Juan County, Summit County, Ouray
County, and Pitkin County—I am, in
some respects, left at a loss of words in
terms of trying to understand what
local community support my distin-
guished colleague is referencing in
terms of it being lacking.
And, of course, it makes perfect sense
that these communities would so over-
whelmingly support this bill because
they have been engaged in important
stakeholder input on this bill for 10
years, long before I came to Congress.
This bill has been the product of a
very robust community-driven stake-
holder process, which is why it has
overwhelming support of not just the
local communities that are impacted
by it, but, ultimately, by the people
shown by just a recent empirical study
that over 70 percent of the people on
the western side of Colorado and writ
at large in the State support the provi-
sions of the CORE Act. That is why it
has also earned the support of my dis-
tinguished colleague from Colorado,
the dean of our delegation.
Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to
the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms.
DEGETTE).
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Chair, I want
to thank my colleague from Colorado
and laud him for taking on the mantle
of supporting the Colorado Outdoor
Recreation and Economy Act.
Our State has some of the most re-
markable outdoor landscapes in the
country. As a fourth-generation Colo-
radan, I understand how important our
public lands are to our livelihoods, our
health, and, yes, our identity.
Like many Coloradans, I have per-
sonal memories of camping and hiking
with my family and using our public
lands to teach my daughters about the
importance of environmental steward-
ship and conservation.
But preserving our public lands is not
important just to those of us who enjoy
exploring the outdoors; it is important
to our State’s economy.
We can’t allow ourselves to sit back
and assume that the places we cherish
today will be there for future genera-
tions to experience as well. Every 30
seconds, our Nation loses the equiva-
lent of a football field of natural area
due to human activity.
Let me say that again. Every 30 sec-
onds, our Nation loses a football field
of natural area due to human activity.
We are seeing this right now in our
home State with the pressures of popu-
lation growth.
That is why, for more than 20 years,
I have been working with my col-
leagues in Congress, with local elected
officials, and with citizens across the
State to protect the very few remain-
ing special areas that we have left.
That is why I am so honored that we
are now beginning to see the fruits of
all of this action.
The legislation that we will vote on
today will protect an additional 400,000
acres of public lands in our State, in-
cluding 70,000 acres of wilderness. It is
part of our overall effort to preserve 1
million acres of public lands in our
State, not just for wilderness, but also
for multiple use, which is so critical for
our State.
Together, the CORE Act and the Col-
orado Wilderness Act, which I am the
prime sponsor of, will help boost Colo-
rado’s multibillion-dollar outdoor
recreation industry, which supports
more than 220,000 jobs in our State.
They will also help increase our Na-
tion’s tourism industry, lift nearby
property values, and improve residents’
overall quality of life.
Our constituents have been clear on
this issue: they want to protect our
public lands. As Congressman NEGUSE
noted, one recent poll found that as
many as 90 percent of Colorado’s resi-
dents believe that protecting our out-
door recreation economy is important
to the future of our State.
Our State has changed. Our economy
is dependent on the preservation of our
special remaining wild places. I know
many of us in the congressional delega-
tion would agree. That is why we are so
united in this effort. That is why we
are eager to take on this fight.
Madam Chair, I urge all of my col-
leagues to give the people of our State
what they want and to vote for this im-
portant legislation.
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, I do agree with my col-
league from Denver that the outdoor
recreation industry in Colorado is a
thriving and vital part of our State’s
economy. We have such good material,
such a good environment to work with
that it is no wonder.
I would have to point out that, fortu-
nately, the lands that are under consid-
eration in this bill already have one
form of protection or another due to
being wilderness study areas or other
types of Federal lands. The develop-
ment that was being mentioned—one
football field every 30 seconds—doesn’t
apply to these lands. These lands are
not in that category.
Ms. DEGETTE. Will the gentleman
yield?
Mr. LAMBORN. I yield to the gentle-
woman from Colorado.
Ms. DEGETTE. I would just note—
and the gentleman and I have actually
discussed this—as we have been pre-
paring the maps for my bill, which we
are going to be seeing in the Natural
Resources Committee in the next few
weeks, we have seen, even in areas that
are protected as wilderness study areas
or other BLM Federal lands, we have
seen a steady erosion by people who are
over loving these lands, and that is
why we need these protections.
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Chair, re-
claiming my time, I understand where
the gentlewoman is coming from.
Without getting into the philo-
sophical area for time constraints over
restricting lands that very few people
can enter into as opposed to having
lands as open as possible for as many
people and many uses as possible,
which I think is a balance we have to
strike—there has got to be a place for
both—I think we need to keep our dis-
cussion for the next part of our debate
on the local collaboration, or lack
thereof.
Madam Chair, for that reason, I yield
10 minutes to the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. TIPTON).
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Chair, when it comes to pub-
lic lands management, Colorado has a
long history of balancing the interests
of a broad range of stakeholders, in-
cluding the needs and interests of citi-
zens who may not be the most vocal on
the issues. This is accomplished
through proactive outreach to commu-
nities and engagement with citizens
and local leaders who know their areas
best.
This type of local engagement has
proven to be effective on previous pub-
lic lands efforts, such as Hermosa
Creek and Chimney Rock in southwest
Colorado. In both cases, there was an
extensive and inclusive community
outreach process with many months of
bipartisan support, negotiations, and
conversations with stakeholders from
all sides of the debate.
The result was the House passing bi-
partisan measures to be able to protect
these individual and valuable open
spaces, both of which have become law.
Behind these efforts was a recognition
of historic multiple uses of the land as
well as for the communities who live
there.
For many decades, Colorado has re-
sponsibly developed natural resources
on public lands, which has provided
critical funding for emergency serv-
ices, education, and infrastructure for
rural communities that would other-
wise be unable to have these services.
While doing this, Colorado has also em-
braced a thriving outdoor economy and
protected access to the public lands for
historical uses, as well as for sports-
men and other recreational access.
We have prioritized conservation of
delicate ecosystems and habitats, pro-
tected cultural and historic sites, and
defended private property and water
rights. There are certainly disagree-
ments on the most effective ways to be
able to carry out these ideas, but most
of us agree that the most effective ap-
proach to be able to work through
these disagreements is by being able to
listen to the local communities and
those most affected by Federal deci-
sions and finding a way to be able to

incorporate those ideas into balanced
legislation.
Unfortunately, we have not seen this
same type of outreach negotiation and
local engagement with the CORE Act
as a whole. Some stakeholders and
communities in the Third Congres-
sional District were not included. It is
important that we do not discount the
Third District voices who feel like they
were excluded or that their concerns
were disregarded.
Madam Chair, I have heard from nu-
merous county commissioners who
have not been involved in the legisla-
tive process for the CORE Act and have
simply asked to have their concerns
addressed by the House before a vote
takes place. This is the same feedback
I have repeatedly heard from stake-
holders and local elected officials in
the Third District following public
meetings on these issues over the past
few months.
I am not saying that there is not sup-
port for the CORE Act in the Third
District, because there is. Many of our
resort and mountain communities are
strongly behind the bill, and it is just
as important to listen to their input as
those in the rest of western Colorado.
I am optimistic that we can find a
balanced public lands bill that reflects
all of these communities, but it can’t
happen if one side is left out of the con-
versation from the beginning. More
outreach needs to happen, negotiations
need to take place, and compromise
needs to be made.
The commissioners, other local elect-
ed officials, and stakeholders in the
counties that have not yet been in-
cluded in the experiences have knowl-
edge and opinions that should be given
due consideration when crafting public
policy land bills that directly impact
many of them and indirectly impacts
all of them. We firmly are committed
to giving all counties in the Third Dis-
trict the opportunity to be able to have
their voices heard and their ideas in-
cluded in any public lands legislation
that impacts their region.
During a House Natural Resources
Committee on the CORE Act and be-
fore the House Rules Committee this
week, I introduced amendments that
included reasonable and necessary ad-
ditions to the bill based on direct feed-
back from Third District stakeholders
and officials.
b 1830
I provided my colleagues from Colo-
rado who sponsored this legislation in
both the House and the Senate with a
similar list of items for inclusion be-
forehand.
These suggestions include protec-
tions for existing water and grazing
rights; codification of the U.S. Army
High-Altitude Aviation Training Site’s
flight guidelines over wilderness areas;
allowing for current public land man-
agement activities to continue in
recreation areas, and language to en-
sure that leaseholders in the Thompson
Divide are fairly compensated for the
value of their leases.
These amendments are not con-
troversial. They are not partisan. They
do not disrupt or alter the outcomes of
the bill. What these amendments do is
ensure that there is no ambiguity in
the intent of the legislation, as stated
by the bill’s sponsors and supporters.
There is great harm in ambiguity,
which is what will result if these
amendments are not accepted.
I have also offered two amendments
to release wilderness study areas, at
the request of counties in which they
are located. Most of these areas have
been deemed unsuitable for wilderness
designation. That does not mean that
they will not be protected public lands
because they all have some measure of
protection.
Madam Chairwoman, responsible
management is not always the result of
more restrictive designations. Instead,
it can also mean giving local commu-
nities greater flexibility to be able to
address local land challenges.
In recent testimony given before the
House Natural Resources Committee,
Montezuma County Commissioner
Keenan Ertel made the argument for
releasing wilderness study areas when
they have been deemed unsuitable by
the Federal land management agencies
for wilderness protections. Seven years
ago, the Menefee Mountain Wilderness
Study Area was ravaged by fire. Years
after the fire, noxious weeds consumed
much of the landscape due to the strin-
gent protections given in the area. The
weed concerns continue to progress, as
projected in this photo.
Local agencies are limited in their
ability to be able to proactively man-
age these invasive species because of
the stringent wilderness protections
that remain in place.
If the Colorado delegation is truly
vested in passing a statewide public
lands bill that has broad local con-
sensus, why aren’t we including the re-
moval of these areas that rely on Fed-
eral action to be able to allow for bet-
ter management of these lands?
I have suggested to my bicameral
Colorado colleagues, and even sub-
mitted an amendment, but it was not
adopted. I continue to hear that local
concerns have been addressed, yet we
cannot assure Montezuma County resi-
dents that theirs have even been con-
sidered.
Along with allowing local commu-
nities greater access to be able to pro-
tect their cherished open spaces from
potential wildfires, it also includes
buffer zones between wilderness and
nonwilderness areas.
A look at the devastating wildfires in
Colorado over the years shows us just
how important this is. In 2013, the West
Fork Complex fire, which burned over
100,000 acres in southwest Colorado, is
a prime example of how forest fires
have no regard for arbitrary lines, as
shown on the map.
We have, unfortunately, seen the
aftermath of this fire and other fires,
and they threaten the stability of
roads and water quality and are great-
er erosion threats for many years to
come.
I raised this concern with the spon-
sors of the bill, suggesting that we in-
crease the offsets for the trails running
on the borders of the wilderness area
from 50 to 150 feet. With this reason-
able ask, I believe we can eliminate un-
necessary risks to our forests and pro-
tect them from future forest fires that
have the potential to jump across
boundary lines onto other public and
private lands. Yet, this amendment
was not allowed to move to the floor
for consideration, nor were 8 out of the
10 amendments that I introduced.
Had there been greater outreach
across the Third District, the CORE
Act’s sponsors could have heard more
examples just like these that need to
be addressed. This week alone, we re-
ceived letters from Montezuma County,
Dolores County, Rio Blanco County,
Montrose County, Mesa County, all of
which have various concerns about the
CORE Act today. That is also accom-
panied by letters from individuals.
Madam Chairwoman, I applaud the
CORE Act sponsor, my Colorado col-
league, Mr. NEGUSE. He has a passion
for being able to protect public lands in
Colorado. It happens to be a passion we
share.
However, Colorado’s Third District,
where most of this bill will have an im-
pact, not Mr. NEGUSE’s district—I
would be remiss if I did not speak out
on behalf of my constituents—have yet
to have their voices heard in this proc-
ess or their issues addressed.
I am optimistic that we could even-
tually get broad community consensus
through the Third District on the
CORE Act, but first, there is outreach
that needs to be done, issues to be
worked out, and compromises to be
made.
There is no doubt that the CORE Act
will pass the House tomorrow, that the
bill will head to the Senate. However,
in good conscience, given the concerns
that we have heard out of the district
that have not been addressed, I will
have to reluctantly vote ‘‘no’’ on this
current version of the bill.
It is my hope that the Senate will
consider my amendments, that they
will be included, that continued out-
reach occurs, and that we include the
ideas of all western Colorado.
I stand willing and ready to be able
to work with them.
Madam Chairwoman, I thank the
gentleman for yielding me the time.
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chairwoman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Just a few points before I yield some
time to my distinguished colleague
from the Sixth Congressional District.
I would first say, this reference to
wilderness study areas and the notion
that because, as my distinguished col-
league from Colorado Springs men-
tioned, there are some wilderness study
areas in certain areas, that, therefore,
no further protections are needed, of
course, as the gentleman from the

Third Congressional District just men-
tioned, in his effort to eliminate some
of those wilderness study areas, the
case in point that permanent protec-
tions are, in fact, needed. There is a
reason why we pursue these permanent
protections, and that is, ultimately, to
ensure that the lands are protected for
future generations, like my daughter,
so that she can enjoy the same treas-
ured public lands that I have had ac-
cess to.
I would also say, with respect to my
colleague from the Third Congressional
District, what I failed to hear during
his remarks or, for that matter, the
gentleman from Colorado Springs’ re-
marks is, again, any reference to a sin-
gle county that is directly impacted by
this bill that opposes this bill.
I understand the gentleman ref-
erenced Montezuma County, and I
found the letter from Montezuma
County a bit perplexing given that
none of the CORE Act designations are
in their county or even bordering their
county.
As I mentioned earlier, the San
Miguel Board of County Commis-
sioners, which is in the Third Congres-
sional District, supports this bill. The
Gunnison Board of County Commis-
sioners, the Eagle Board of County
Commissioners, the San Juan Board of
County Commissioners, the Ouray
Board of County Commissioners, the
Pitkin Board of County Commis-
sioners, and a variety of other counties
have expressed support for the provi-
sions of the bill that impact their par-
ticular county, including the Garfield
Board of County Commissioners, which
is in the Third Congressional District.
So, make no mistake, I respect philo-
sophical disagreements that may exist
about the need to protect public lands,
and there may be—in fact, there clear-
ly is a disagreement there, and we are
going to land on different sides of that
debate.
But facts matter. And, ultimately,
the local communities across the State
that are impacted by this bill directly
have made clear that they support the
CORE Act. As I said, it is no surprise
that they do because they have been
engaged in the debate around the
CORE Act for a decade.
I have each title of the CORE Act
that has been introduced since 2011 by
Mr. UDALL when he served in this
Chamber, by Mr. Salazar, and, of
course, by Senator BENNET in the upper
Chamber. This bill is the product of a
decade of collaboration.
Ultimately, what I have heard from
these county commissioners and so
many others is that they are tired of
waiting, Madam Chair.
I recognize that I am new to Wash-
ington, but ultimately, I think our job
here is to deliver results for the people
who elect us to serve.
I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman
from Colorado (Mr. CROW), who has
served in our armed services so brave-
ly, to discuss the HAATS issue, in par-
ticular. Then, I am happy to yield to
Mr. TIPTON so that we can engage in a
colloquy.
Mr. CROW. Madam Chairwoman, I
rise today in support of the Colorado
Outdoor Recreation and Economy Act.
I would first like to thank my col-
leagues and friends from the Colorado
delegation, Congressman JOE NEGUSE,
and Senator MICHAEL BENNET, for their
dedicated, hard work on this important
bill.
Colorado is home to 4 national parks,
41 State parks, 960 wildlife species, and
6,000 miles of rivers. From hiking, to
camping and skiing with my family, in-
cluding my two children, who I am
proud to say are fifth-generation Colo-
radans, I know that among the most
important aspects of the Colorado way
of life are the beautiful places where
we live, work, and play.
But we must act quickly to ensure
that Colorado’s many national treas-
ures are protected for our children, our
grandchildren, and the generations to
come.
The CORE Act will help us accom-
plish this by providing permanent pro-
tections for over 400,000 acres of Colo-
rado’s public lands. It unites and builds
on many prior efforts by protecting
four iconic landscapes in one single,
all-encompassing conservation bill for
all of Colorado.
As an Army veteran, I am also
thrilled to highlight the U.S. Army’s
10th Mountain Division, whose mem-
bers trained at historic Camp Hale and
fought valiantly in World War II. At
the peak of the war, Camp Hale housed
as many as 14,000 soldiers. They were
trained in skiing, snowshoeing, moun-
tain climbing, cold-weather survival
skills, and winter combat to prepare
themselves for the Alpine warfare that
awaited them in northern Italy.
In 1945, they broke through German
mountain defenses, drawing forces
away from other theaters and playing a
critical role in winning World War II.
Many of them came back afterward
to help build Colorado’s outdoor recre-
ation industry that we now know, love,
and cherish today.
By passing this bill, we honor the
10th Mountain Division’s legacy and
the sacrifices of those soldiers by des-
ignating over 28,000 acres of land that
constitutes Camp Hale as the Nation’s
first-ever National Historic Landscape.
This measure ensures that people of
all ages can recreate on the Camp Hale
lands, walk in the footsteps of those
soldiers who trained there, and protect
the site for future generations so that
history and legacy will live on.
I am honored to work with my dele-
gation colleagues on this effort. The
CORE Act is a once-in-a-generation
protection of lands to hand to our kids
and grandkids so that they can con-
tinue to love Colorado as much as we
do.
I urge all Members to vote in favor of
this bill.
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chairwoman, I
am happy to yield to the gentleman
from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON) to give him
a moment to respond. It seemed like he
had something to say.
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Chair, I think
the gentleman mentioned Montrose
County. Is it going to be impacted by
Curecanti?
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I appre-
ciate Representative TIPTON, my dis-
tinguished colleague, for mentioning
that. I would say a few things.
First, of the nine counties that are
impacted, as I mentioned, eight of
them have expressed support for the
provisions of the bill that impact them.
While I don’t have the letter from
Montrose County that apparently came
in today—and I am happy to visit with
the gentleman further about that let-
ter—my understanding is that they ex-
pressed support still for the Curecanti
title of the bill in their district.
I also would just say this: If the gen-
tleman is willing to make a commit-
ment that he will vote for this bill if
the Montrose Board of County Commis-
sioners supports the bill—is that the
gentleman’s intent?
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Chair, I have all
the other issues that I have outlined,
and I need those amendments to be
able to do that. That does not make
the bill bad, but it does make it an im-
perfect bill.
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, reclaim-
ing my time, the gentleman will have
an opportunity to talk. I would just
say this: We had this similar debate in
the Rules Committee on Monday.
Again, I am new to Washington, so per-
haps this is just the way the process
works, but this notion that amend-
ments are offered and then a represen-
tation is made by the gentleman that
even if every amendment passed, they
would not support the bill, fundamen-
tally, for me, this process is about good
faith, negotiation, and discussion to
get to a consensus.
I believe there are a number of
amendments that the Representative,
along with several others that have
been proposed, that we are going to de-
bate tonight. Some of those may, in
fact, be amendments that we can agree
to. But I would hope that my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle
would approach the discussion on those
amendments with that same good
faith, with understanding that they
would hope to get to yes, because a
similar discussion happened earlier
this year with respect to the Garfield
Board of County Commissioners.
Their nonsupport of the bill was jus-
tified and rationalized as a reason to
oppose it. Of course, eventually, by
working with those county commis-
sioners, Senator BENNET’s office and
myself were able to negotiate a com-
promise so that they could be in a posi-
tion to support the title of the bill that
impacts that county, so that we could
protect the treasured public lands in
the Thompson Divide.
Again, I believe it is important to un-
derscore that point, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Chairwoman,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8650 October 30, 2019
Madam Chair, I would point out that
Mr. TIPTON offered 10 amendments in
the Rules Committee, only three of
which were adopted. There were seven
amendments right there that were not
even brought to the floor for debate. I
think that that is unfortunate.
Madam Chairman, I yield 5 minutes
to the gentleman from California (Mr.
MCCLINTOCK) who is the ranking mem-
ber on the Subcommittee on Water,
Oceans, and Wildlife on the Natural Re-
sources Committee.
b 1845
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Chairwoman, when I chaired
the Public Lands Subcommittee, we set
three overarching principles for the
management of our public lands: to re-
store public access to the public lands,
to restore good management to the
public lands, and to restore the Federal
Government as a good neighbor to
those communities directly impacted
by the public lands.
This bill appears to me to be the op-
posite of all of these principles. It
closes off public use and access, it con-
signs our lands to a policy of neglect,
and it thumbs our nose at the wishes of
many of the people in the affected re-
gion.
H.R. 823 is a lopsided bill that offers
a comparatively small, 28,000 acres, for
motorized access versus roughly 400,000
acres of new wilderness enclosures. So
7 percent of the land is provided for
motorized access and 93 percent of the
land is closed to that access. That
means, Madam Chair, you can’t drive
in to enjoy a family camping trip, and
you can’t even bring bicycles.
It withdraws all these lands from any
kind of resource development, which
means that taxpayers will not have the
benefit of revenues that these lands
could produce. Much of the acreage
designated for wilderness restrictions
does not even meet the legal require-
ments under the Wilderness Act, and
yet they are imposed in disregard of
that law. So, so much for the public’s
right to use the public lands.
As the growing menace of wildfires
attests, 45 years of neglect of sound
forest management due to the so-called
environmental laws of the 1970s has
abandoned our forests to themselves,
and like any untended garden, an aban-
doned forest will grow and grow and
grow until it chokes itself to death,
and it is then consumed by cata-
strophic wildfire. Modern forest man-
agement broke this cycle of morbid
overgrowth followed by catastrophic
wildfire. I can tell you, in a State with
a significant wildfire risk, this bill
would further reduce the acres that
have been identified as suitable for ac-
tive forest management by approxi-
mately 8,000 acres. So, so much for
good management of the public lands.
This bill flies in the face of signifi-
cant local opposition, as expressed by
many of the locally elected representa-
tives of the communities affected by
this legislation, as we have heard from
Mr. TIPTON. Rural county commis-
sioners have warned that this bill will
harm the economies of their local com-
munities by removing multiple-use
designations from these lands. In fact,
when Republicans offered an amend-
ment calling for consultation with the
local communities that have been ig-
nored by this legislation, that amend-
ment was rejected on a party-line vote.
So, so much for being a good neighbor
to communities most affected by the
Federal lands.
Now, in the past, the Natural Re-
sources Committee has prided itself on
attempting to forge bipartisan con-
sensus on its bills. Those days appear
to be over. In fact, 65 percent of the
lands affected by H.R. 823 aren’t even
in the author’s district. They are in the
district of Mr. TIPTON, who has just ex-
pressed his significant concerns over
this legislation, who was never con-
sulted before the bill was introduced,
and who was barred from engaging the
bill’s sponsor during the committee’s
consideration of the bill on April 2. In
this kangaroo proceeding, the bill’s au-
thor acted as a witness, an advocate,
and the chairman of the proceeding all
at the same time.
Every Republican Member from Colo-
rado opposes this bill, and the bill is re-
ported to us on a straight party-line
vote. It is obvious that the majority
has no interest in balancing the con-
cerns of local residents, taxpayers, rec-
reational user groups, and conservation
groups, but instead feels entitled to im-
pose its will over the pleas of the peo-
ple most directly impacted. Fortu-
nately, our system of government
assures that such legislation, while it
might pass one House, as I am sure it
will tomorrow, but it will have no
chance of becoming law—and rightly
so.
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, again, I
think it is important to underscore the
facts. While I appreciate the gentleman
from California making his case, his
characterization of local support or
lack thereof on this bill is simply not
consistent with the facts, because,
again, I have yet to hear of a single
community that is directly impacted
by the CORE Act that opposes the title
of the CORE Act that impacts that
community—not one, Madam Chair. I
have been waiting. Coloradans are
waiting.
Again, it is completely permissible to
have a philosophical debate about
whether or not to protect public lands.
I happen to believe that these incred-
ibly iconic places across our State
ought to be protected. They ought to
be preserved. My colleagues may dis-
agree. That is their right. But it is im-
portant to stress the facts.
To that point, the last point I will
make, and just yet another area that
apparently needs to be clarified, is
around motorized recreation. Any
characterization that the CORE Act
mandates widespread closures of trails
or roads is false. This bill does not
close any existing roads, jeep trails,
off-highway vehicle trails, motorcycle
trails, or groomed snowmobile trails,
not one.
Facts matter, Madam Chair.
I would ask the Chair how much time
do I have remaining.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from Col-
orado has 10 minutes remaining.
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Chair, I yield
5 minutes to the gentleman from Ar-
kansas (Mr. WESTERMAN), who has a
master’s degree in forestry from Yale
University.
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair, as
much as I appreciate my colleagues’
desire to do something good, I must
rise in opposition today to H.R. 823.
As we all know, wilderness designa-
tions in theory implement natural
management, meaning that man is to
have a hands-off approach on the man-
agement of the forest. But this is a
farce, because when catastrophic
wildfires ignite, as they will under nat-
ural management, we often rush to put
the fires out, which is just as much
human management as thinning or
other more recognized forestry man-
agement processes.
We need wilderness areas in our
country, and we need to manage them
as such if we want to be intellectually
honest in claiming them as wilderness
areas. This works in areas like Yellow-
stone National Park where the pre-
dominant species is lodgepole pine that
naturally burns to the ground approxi-
mately every century, like we saw
when one-third of the park burned in
the 1980s.
The idea that we can preserve a for-
est is misguided. Forests are living or-
ganisms, and there is only one way to
preserve a living organism: first you
have to kill it. Take, for instance, a cu-
cumber. If you want to make a pickle,
the first thing you do to preserve a cu-
cumber into a pickle is you boil it, you
put it in vinegar, you put it in a jar,
and you preserve it. If you want to pre-
serve human tissue, you put the tissue
in formaldehyde. There is a misnomer
that we can preserve our forests be-
cause forests are living organisms.
We should be discussing instead con-
servation. We should want to conserve
our forests, like Teddy Roosevelt and
Gifford Pinchot proposed.
Colorado’s forests are currently in an
unhealthy state. They are overstocked
and infested with insects like the bark
and pine beetle. I say that based on a
report from the Colorado State Forest
Service 2018 Forest Health Report.
It says that, for the seventh consecu-
tive year, Colorado’s most widespread
and destructive insect pest was the
spruce beetle. This insect has now af-
fected more than 1.8 million cumu-
lative acres since 2000, with a total of
178,000 acres of active infestations oc-
curring in high-level Engelmann spruce
forests in 2018. A 4-year trend of tens of
thousands of new acres infested annu-
ally indicates a continuing spread of

spruce beetle into previously
uninfested forests.
Moreover, more and more Coloradans
are living closer to their forests and
closer to the risk of wildfire.
Again, from the report:
A recent update to the CSFS-administered
Colorado Wildfire Risk Assessment Portal
indicated that the population living in areas
at risk to wildland fire in Colorado increased
to approximately 50 percent from 2012 to
2017, surpassing 2.9 million people.
Madam Chair, Colorado has some
great places, some of which are incor-
porated into this bill. However, as my
colleague from Colorado, Mr. TIPTON,
and others have alluded to, what the
State needs is not an attempt at pres-
ervation. What they need is the appli-
cation of science to the forests. They
need conservation.
Colorado needs the utilization and
management of their forests to restore
their health and well-being. These for-
ests need thinning, prescribed fire, and
selective timber harvest to restore the
appropriate stand density and reduce
the beetle epidemic.
What these acres do not need is inac-
tion.
Wilderness prevents any action,
which threatens not just the sur-
rounding acreage and the communities
that lie within those boundaries. Our
congressional responsibility is to be
good stewards of our lands and ensure
that they are there for future genera-
tions.
I have no doubt that was the spon-
sor’s intent when writing this bill.
However, we cannot just claim vast
swaths of land and call our work done.
Instead, we must be precise as to what
we are designing and why.
Wilderness, in this case, is not the
answer. Natural management will not
be followed because when life and prop-
erty are at risk, we will spend vast re-
sources to extinguish nature’s manage-
ment tools.
Authorizing this action over the ob-
jections of State and Federal represen-
tation is not wise. The future will be
our judge if this land is designated wil-
derness, and nature will deliver its ver-
dict in time. None of us may even be
alive when the verdict is delivered, but
I desire for the RECORD to indicate that
I argued on the side of sound science,
that I argued to be responsible and use
science and management to restore our
forest resiliency, and that I argued to
make our forest carbon sinks instead of
carbon emitters.
The CHAIR. The time of the gen-
tleman has expired.
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Chair, I yield
the gentleman from Arkansas an addi-
tional 30 seconds.
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Chair-
woman, I argue for wildlife, for water,
and for a better environment, and it is
because of these reasons that I encour-
age my colleagues to vote against H.R.
823.
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chairman, I
have great respect for my colleague
from Arkansas. I know he has a deep
experience in his field, I appreciate him
on the Natural Resources Committee,
and I enjoy serving with him on that
committee.
I would ask my distinguished col-
league whether he would support the
bill if we were to, say, amend the bill
to give the Secretary unilateral power
to do what the Secretary determines to
be necessary for the control of fire and
insects.
Would the gentleman be amenable to
that?
Mr. WESTERMAN. Will the gen-
tleman yield?
Mr. NEGUSE. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Arkansas.
Mr. WESTERMAN. I would be ame-
nable if we did that, but then it
wouldn’t be wilderness area.
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I thank
my distinguished colleague from Ar-
kansas; and I will tell the gentleman
that we don’t need to amend the bill
because that language is in the bill, re-
peatedly in the bill because I share
your concerns regarding wildfire, as do
my distinguished colleagues from Colo-
rado.
So we put great care to put into the
bill language that reiterates ‘‘the Sec-
retary may carry out any activity that
the Secretary determines to be nec-
essary for the control of fire, insects,
and diseases.’’
So since we have that provision in
the bill, I am hoping that the gen-
tleman will join the bill, and I cer-
tainly hope that my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle will do the same,
because I think this bill strikes the
right balance in terms of protecting
these incredible public lands and doing
so in a way that ensures that we are
not at risk of a wildfire and mitigating
as best as we can.
I would also tell the gentleman, of
the 400,000 acres in the bill—and I look
forward to bringing my colleague from
Arkansas to Colorado to see these pub-
lic lands—only 73,000 of them would be
designated as wilderness in this bill,
and many of those acres are actually
above the tree line or otherwise
unforested.
So, I think the language of the bill
addresses the gentleman’s concerns,
and I appreciate his raising them. I
also very much appreciate his quoting
a personal hero of mine, and I suspect
a hero of many of the Members in this
Chamber, and that is Teddy Roosevelt,
who, of course, was an esteemed con-
servationist in his time.
I will share a quote that I have found
to be very compelling: ‘‘Here is your
country. Cherish these natural won-
ders, cherish the natural resources,
cherish the history and romance as a
sacred heritage, for your children and
your children’s children.
‘‘Do not let selfish men or greedy in-
terests skin your country of its beauty,
its riches or its romance.
Madam Chair, it is important that we
not lose sight of the bigger picture,
which is that this bill is protecting
iconic places like the Thompson Divide
in Colorado from oil and gas develop-
ment.
The ranchers, the citizens of that
community, they have been waiting an
awfully long time for the protections
in this bill, which is why I am so proud
to be able to carry the baton for them
in the CORE Act.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
b 1900
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Chair, I am
ready to close, if that is where the gen-
tleman from Colorado stands, also.
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I am
ready to close as well.
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, let me say that I am
informed that Garfield and Montrose
Counties, although they are com-
fortable with certain portions of the
bill, are not willing to endorse the bill
as a whole.
Also, I want to say that Colorado
Springs Utilities in my district, rep-
resenting about half a million people,
and the Aurora Water District have
raised concerns that the Camp Hale
National Historic Landscape designa-
tion will negatively impact their exist-
ing and future water rights. These con-
cerns have gone unaddressed.
I finish by stating what the adminis-
tration, the Office of Management and
Budget, says about this bill, which
means, basically, that they have con-
cerns that, if not addressed, will result
in a veto of this bill, and it will not be-
come law.
‘‘The administration opposes H.R.
823, the Colorado Outdoor Recreation
and Economy Act. This bill would im-
pose land restrictions on nearly 400,000
acres of land in Colorado and would re-
duce areas open for motorized recre-
ation. The administration has pledged
to expand access to America’s public
lands; increase hunting, fishing, and
recreational opportunities nationwide;
and enhance conservation stewardship.
H.R. 823, however, would not achieve
these goals in a balanced way, and the
administration opposes it as it is cur-
rently drafted.’’
It goes on to say, among other
things, ‘‘Rural communities have
raised concerns that the land-use re-
strictions included in H.R. 823 would
have negative effects on local econo-
mies, and, as evidenced by the com-
mittee process, it appears that local
sentiment has not been adequately
taken into account when developing
this bill. The administration, there-
fore, opposes H.R. 823 in its current
form, but it is willing to work with the
Congress to improve it if the bill is
considered further.’’
So if it were presented to the Presi-
dent in its current form, his advisers
would recommend he veto it.
I also have the understanding that
the Senate will not take up this bill ei-
ther.
Maybe it is an interesting exercise
that we are doing here, but it is not

anything that is going to result in a
law.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to oppose this bill, and let’s move on
from here. I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, it is important that we
not divorce ourselves from the fate of
this legislation. Whether it will be-
come law or not is dependent on each
and every one of us and where we stand
on the bill.
While I have great respect for my col-
league from Colorado Springs, I think
it is fitting that the closing that he of-
fered cited President Trump and his
threatened veto letter.
For me, and for the people I rep-
resent, for the citizens of my State,
this bill is not about the President. It
is not about any of us in this Chamber.
It is about them and the public lands
that they are so blessed to have in
their respective communities.
I said this earlier—I will say it
again—as a freshman lawmaker, I un-
derstand that I have not been in Con-
gress long, but these pieces of legisla-
tion have been.
Public lands are at the heart of who
we are as Coloradans. You heard the
dean of our delegation talk about our
recent poll where 73 percent of Colo-
radans consider themselves outdoor
recreation enthusiasts. Whether they
live in Gunnison, Glenwood Springs,
Boulder, Fort Collins, Eagle County,
Summit County, and everywhere in be-
tween, 73 percent say the ability to live
near, recreate on, and enjoy public
lands, like national forests, parks, and
trails, is a significant reason why they
live in the West.
Ninety percent believe that the out-
door recreation economy is important
to the future of Colorado. It is why so
many have labored on various compo-
nents of this bill for so long—my prede-
cessor, then-Congressman, now-Gov-
ernor Jared Polis; former Senator
Mark Udall; former Congressman John
Salazar; and, of course, Senator BEN-
NET today leading this companion leg-
islation in the Senate; and the count-
less county commissioners, mayors,
city councilors, town trustees, con-
servationists, and ranchers who have
worked to build consensus on this bill,
literally for a decade.
Many of them traveled here just a
few months ago when we had a robust
debate in the Committee on Natural
Resources, and we were able to mark
up this bill and send it here to the
floor. They deserve to have their voices
heard.
My colleagues can say as often as
they would like that there are local
voices missing or ignored, but that
does not make it true. We know that
the communities impacted by this bill
support it. That is a fact. There can be
no dispute about that.
We know that strong policy requires
compromise, years of input, and, yes,
vigorous debate. I am happy to partici-
pate in that debate, but the people of
Colorado have made their voices clear
on protecting these public lands.
I mentioned the stakeholder process
that we have been engaged in, that the
communities have been engaged in,
that this State has been engaged in for
a decade, regardless of what party was
in power or what election year. It was
local communities and stakeholders
coming to the table to craft the des-
ignations that you see on the map to
protect these wonderful iconic places
that you see to my right. They have
been advocating for far too long not to
see action from their elected officials.
Madam Chair, it is time that Con-
gress listen to the people of Colorado
and vote to protect the places that my
home State hold so dear. It is time to
hold ourselves accountable. It is time
we pass the CORE Act.
Madam Chair, I urge swift adoption
of H.R. 823, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

bate has expired.

AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR. CURTIS
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 1 printed in part
B of House Report 116–264.
Mr. CURTIS. Madam Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate
the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of the bill, insert the following:
TITLE V—APPLICATION
SEC. 501. APPLICATION.
Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Act, this Act shall not apply to any
lands or waters in the Third Congressional
District of Colorado as in existence on the
date of enactment of this Act.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 656, the gentleman from Utah
(Mr. CURTIS) and a Member opposed
each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Utah.
Mr. CURTIS. Madam Chair, before I
begin, I would like to list the number
of areas where I likely agree with my
good friend from Colorado (Mr.
NEGUSE).
We share a State, a boundary, and
our States are beautiful and full of
public lands and recreational opportu-
nities and areas that are majestic and
are great treasures in our wonderful
country.
I believe personally that strong,
pragmatic legislation to solve these
local land managements is very impor-
tant and far superior to efforts like the
Antiquities Act. I thank my colleague
for the years that have gone into this
bill and his personal time to build con-
sensus in the area.
I found myself in his position just
several months ago, offering a bill in
my State. I believe the Congressman
supported that bill, and I thank him
for that support. It was a million acres
of public land designation in my State.
While not everybody got what they
wanted, we were able to approach it
from a prospect where I was able to get
ranchers, environmentalists, outdoor
enthusiasts to support that bill.
The major difference between our
two bills and why I stand today is that,
on my bill, I was able to claim support
from my local county commissioners.
Every elected official in the State, my
Governor, the State legislature, and
the entire delegation of Utah were able
to support that.
While I want my friend from Colo-
rado to succeed in his endeavor, I feel
moving this bill without the support of
the entire delegation and its members
who represent the impacted land is a
mistake.
I am told that half of the Colorado
delegation opposes this bill, including
a Member who represents 65 percent of
the land covered by the bill. While I ap-
plaud the consensus that has been put
into this, I don’t believe there is
enough consensus to get this bill across
the finish line and into law.
With that said, in anticipation of the
gentleman from Colorado’s question, if
this amendment passes, yes, I will sup-
port his bill. However, that is my sec-
ond choice, and I think a poor, distant
second choice to my first choice, which
is that we would be able to find con-
sensus with the other members of the
delegation and move forward.
I can’t support a bill that lacks the
consensus needed to continue through

that Mr. NEGUSE and Mr. TIPTON can
work together to work out their re-
maining concerns.
I have had other Members of Con-
gress make proposals in my district,
especially in San Juan and Emery
Counties. I know firsthand that pro-
posals made in another Member’s dis-
trict sometimes can cause problems. In
fact, in my case, it has made it more
difficult to resolve those public land
issues.
Similarly, on a practical level, any
proposal that is not supported by all
Members of Congress who represent
that area doesn’t have the consensus to
get signed into the law. We all have a

duty to represent these local commu-
nities in Congress, and that consensus
is vital for success in any public lands
bill.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I claim
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from Col-
orado is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Chair, I have
great respect for my colleague from
the State of Utah. I enjoy working
with him on the Committee on Natural
Resources and have enjoyed being able
to partner with him on a number of ef-
forts surrounding regenerative agri-
culture and many other subjects.
I would say that I oppose this amend-
ment. The distinguished gentleman, I
believe, mentioned—I hope I am
quoting him right—that when his bill
passed the Chamber, and I believe the
bill earlier this year that passed our
committee, that I was proud to vote
for, he had the support of conservation-
ists in his State, county commis-
sioners, local elected officials, the Gov-
ernor, and his congressional delega-
tion.
I would tell the distinguished gen-
tleman that he may not be aware that,
in our case, we have the support of con-
servationists, county commissioners,
local elected officials, and our Gov-
ernor.
The gentleman is correct that the
only support that seems to be missing
is from Republican colleagues in the
State’s delegation, and that is a shame.
I would hope that a bill that has this
volume of support from local commu-
nities, as has been well established dur-
ing the course of this very vigorous and
robust debate, would earn the support
of my friends on the other side of the
aisle who also have the great privilege
of representing the State that we love
so much.
With respect to the more esoteric
point on legislating in areas that an in-
dividual may not specifically rep-
resent, my understanding—again, I
have been in Congress here for only 10
months. But my sense of it thus far is
that we take votes literally every day
on bills that impact our respective dis-
tricts and, of course, areas far outside
of our districts.
During the 114th Congress, just by
way of example—I was not here. I be-
lieve my friends on the other side of
the aisle who are gathered here today
were. They voted to pass H.R. 8, which
was the North American Energy Secu-
rity Infrastructure Act of 2015, out of
the House.
This was a bill widely opposed by
many Democrats who were concerned
that the bill would lead to increased
opportunities for constructing natural
gas pipelines across Federal lands in
their home districts. That, of course,
did not stop my colleagues from voting
for that bill. They searched their con-
science. They made the conclusion that
they reached. And that is their right.
I would only say that it is the right
of every Member on this particular bill
to, again, search their conscience as to
whether or not they believe areas like
the Thompson Divide ought to be pro-
tected. If they believe that those areas
should be protected, then they ought to
vote ‘‘yes.’’
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.

Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Chair, I would like
to reemphasize my praise for the Con-
gressman from Colorado. The con-
sensus that he mentioned is not a sim-
ple thing and should be applauded.
I simply make a plea and request
that the gentleman will continue to
seek for that consensus, and particu-
larly that of my colleagues and par-
ticularly his colleagues from Colorado,
to see if he can get that final consensus
needed to push this across the finish
line.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time, and I am prepared to yield.
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chair, we will con-
tinue to do that important work, and I
appreciate the gentleman’s statement
in that regard. And I concur with it.
It is worth mentioning—I don’t know
that it has been mentioned yet during
this debate: We have worked very hard.
I have a stack of emails. This is lit-
erally 35, 40 pages of emails, exchanges
between my staff who work on public
lands with the Representative from the
Third Congressional District over the
last 8 months, working, trying to get
that consensus.
I will certainly pledge to the gen-
tleman that we are going to keep doing
it.
Mr. Chair, with that, I am ready to
close as well, but I will reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Chair, I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chair, I yield back
the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. CROW). The
question is on the amendment offered
by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. CUR-

The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.

ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Utah will be post-
poned.
AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MR. BROWN OF
MARYLAND
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 2 printed in
part B of House Report 116–264.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair,
I have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 27, line 2, insert ‘‘and veteran out-
reach and engagement’’ before ‘‘activities’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 656, the gentleman
from Maryland (Mr. BROWN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Maryland.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I want to start by recognizing the
hard work of Chairman GRIJALVA, and
perhaps even more important, Con-
gressman NEGUSE, my good friend, for
his work on the underlying bill and the
amount of time, energy, passion, and
commitment that he devotes to the
conservation and, yes, the preservation
of Colorado’s public lands. They are, in
fact, iconic features of our American
landscape and crucial engines for its
recreational industry and State econ-
omy.
It is our duty to protect these treas-
ured lands and to be responsible stew-
ards so that future generations can
enjoy them as much as we do today. We
recognize how irreplaceable and rich
these lands are, not simply for the
value they bring to our country’s vast
ecological diversity but, also, for their
contribution to our Nation’s history.
One such area is Camp Hale. Decades
ago, Camp Hale served as a base for our
servicemembers to train in mountain
warfare.
I am sure the Chair is excited to
know that the training campground
gave us the 10th Mountain Division,
the famed and heroic mountain fight-
ers, who, through their dedication,
service, and sacrifice, helped our coun-
try achieve victory in World War II.
And, upon returning home, it was these
veterans who drew upon their training
and experiences to help build Colo-
rado’s flourishing outdoor industry.
The legislation recognizes the signifi-
cance of Camp Hale and, as such, des-
ignated it as a National Historic Land-
scape, the first such designation of its
kind.
Yet, to fully honor Camp Hale’s leg-
acy, we should take every measure to
ensure today’s veterans are provided
the opportunity to actively participate
in the stewardship of this unique land-
scape.
As I sit here today in the Chamber, I
hear a call, a loud call, for a bipartisan
amendment that everybody can get
their arms around, so, Mr. Chair, I
offer mine.
My amendment strengthens the un-
derlying legislation by including vet-
eran outreach and engagement activi-
ties as part of the management plan for
Camp Hale.
Public lands are important vehicles
to connect veterans to our national
heritage and history. Many initiatives
and programs have demonstrated the
unique opportunities that the outdoors
offer veterans to reconnect, recover,
and heal after they return from the
battlefield.
We should ensure today’s veterans
are a part of the management of Camp

Hale. By doing so, we honor not only
the legacy of Camp Hale and the serv-
icemembers who trained there but,
also, those who continue to serve this
country today.
While I am not from Colorado, I rec-
ognize that veterans across the coun-
try will flock to this wonderful, his-
toric-designated area and engage in the
activities and the outreach for vet-
erans.
Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues
to support this amendment and the un-
derlying bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chair, I ask
unanimous consent to claim time in
opposition, although I am not opposed
to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection
to the request of the gentleman from
Colorado?
There was no objection.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Colorado is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chair, I will
agree there is a good amendment here
that we can all support.
The underlying bill designated 28,000-
some-odd acres surrounding Camp Hale
as the first-ever National Historic
Landscape.
Now, Camp Hale was a U.S. Army
training facility for what became the
10th Mountain Division, and it was es-
tablished in 1942 in Colorado to provide
winter and mountain warfare training
during World War II. It was also used
during the Cold War as well.
This amendment would add veteran
outreach and engagement activities to
the proposed management plan. It is a
good amendment. It would rightfully
prioritize outreach and involvement of
our Nation’s veterans, so I would agree
with the amendment and ask that my
colleagues vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amend-
ment.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tleman from Maryland (Mr. BROWN).
The amendment was agreed to.

with respect to the National Recreation

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 656, the gentleman
from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Colorado.
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chair, I rise today
to speak in support of my amendment
addressing water rights in the
Curecanti National Recreation Area.
For years, my staff and I have en-
gaged in numerous conversations re-
garding the Curecanti National Recre-
ation Area, and there has been bipar-
tisan agreement in these discussions
that water rights in the region should
remain intact.
This area brings in millions of visi-
tors each year and provides recreation
opportunities that include fishing, hik-
ing, camping, and more. While it might
be an outdoor enthusiast’s paradise, it
is also a source of Colorado’s most pre-
cious resource: water.
This amendment ensures that there
are no unintended consequences in this
legislation for longstanding water
rights in the impacted area.
Mr. Chair, I would like to encourage
my colleagues to be able to support
this, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chair, I ask unani-
mous consent to claim the time in op-
position, though I am not opposed.
The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection
to the request of the gentleman from
Colorado?
There was no objection.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Colorado is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chair, the section
of the bill that the Representative ref-
erenced, in my reading of the bill and
in my understanding of the bill, al-
ready includes some language that is
nearly identical regarding Federal
water rights.
But, that being said, I made a pledge
to the distinguished gentleman from
Utah just a few moments ago in the de-
bate that we would continue working
to try to get to consensus. So I will
support this amendment, and I will en-
courage my colleagues on this side of
the aisle in good faith to support this
amendment as well, and I hope the
sponsor of this amendment would take
that good faith and recognize the same.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentleman for his support for the
amendment.
One of the important points of it, as
with some of the subsequent amend-
ments that we have, is to make sure
that we are codifying the language so
that it is understood.
Mr. Chair, I appreciate the support,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chair, I yield back
the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-

AMENDMENT NO. 4 OFFERED BY MR. TIPTON
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 4 printed in
part B of House Report 116–264.
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 53, after line 15, insert the following:
(c) GRAZING.—The grazing of livestock on
covered land, if established before the date of
enactment of this Act, shall be allowed to
continue subject to such reasonable regula-
tions as are considered to be necessary by
the Secretary with jurisdiction over the cov-
ered land.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 656, the gentleman
from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Colorado.
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chair, I rise today
to support my amendment to be able to
protect longstanding grazing rights in
the Thompson Divide.
Since the days of Colorado’s pioneers,
grazing rights have always played an
essential role in the economy and the
way of life. Generations of Coloradans
have followed suit and continued to
build a robust ranching community, in-
cluding around the Thompson Divide.
In my roundtable discussions with
local communities affected by Federal
public lands, I routinely hear how im-
portant ranching is and the importance
of protecting grazing rights, and this is
true of the Thompson Divide. The per-
manent withdrawal of mineral and en-
ergy development in the region should
not suppress any existing grazing
rights.
Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to
support this amendment, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chair, I would like
to claim time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Colorado is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, this amendment would add
language regarding existing grazing to
a public land withdrawal that protects
a sensitive landscape and its ranchers
from mining.
As a reminder, the CORE Act is sup-
ported by many ranchers who have
been involved with the Thompson Di-
vide Coalition over the years and by
the North Thompson and Coal Basin
Cattlemen’s Association because the
bill would protect their ranching herit-
age on these lands for future genera-
tions.
So, ultimately, I don’t think that
this amendment is necessary, and I do
worry about the potential for unin-
tended consequences. For example, I
hope that adding it does not somehow
imply that the many withdrawals that
Congress routinely enacts without such
language would somehow restrict graz-
ing; although, I know that that is not
my colleague’s intent.
Mr. Chair, I would ask the gen-
tleman—I mean, if the gentleman is

willing to support the underlying bill if
his amendment is adopted, then I
would be happy to support it.
Mr. Chair, with that, I will reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chair, I appreciate
the gentleman’s comments.
I think what is actually important is
precisely the words that the gentleman
used: unintended consequences that
can come.
This is a perfecting amendment to be
able to make sure that we are codi-
fying the importance of those grazing
rights within those communities,
something that is important to not
only the Thompson Divide area but
many of our ranchers who happen to
have some grazing leases on public
lands throughout the western slope of
Colorado, something that is going to be
important, but specifically to this bill,
to make sure that we are codifying the
right to have grazing within the
Thompson Divide area with the min-
eral rights withdrawal that the gen-
tleman is proposing.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chair, while I ap-
preciate my colleague’s statement—
and I don’t know that I heard a par-
ticular answer to the fundamental
question as to whether or not he would
be supportive of this bill were his
amendment to pass—again, I think we
are trying to approach this in a good
faith way. We want to find consensus.
So, if the Representative from the
Third Congressional District believes
that this amendment is necessary to
protect the ranching heritage on these
lands for future generations, which is
obviously a goal that he and I both
share, I will support the amendment.
Mr. Chair, I am no longer in opposi-
tion and will encourage my colleagues
to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the amendment, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chair, I appreciate
the gentleman’s comments and appre-
ciate his support, actually, for this.
This actually shows how we can make
progress when we do have communica-
tion.
In terms of what was going on, some-
thing was lacking on some of these
issues going into the CORE Act. Unfor-
tunately, another eight amendments
which I had proposed were not allowed
to be discussed on this floor tonight.
We have other concerns that have been
expressed through our counties,
through our communities, through in-
dividuals to be able to address as well.
But I am appreciative of the gentle-
man’s support on this amendment and
for recognizing the importance of graz-
ing rights in not only Garfield County
but throughout the West.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.

The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 5 OFFERED BY MR. TIPTON
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 5 printed in
part B of House Report 116–264.
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will

The text of the amendment is as fol-

Page 82, line 3, strike ‘‘2,560’’ and all that
follows through line 8, and insert ‘‘915 acres
of land identified on the map titled
‘Curecanti National Recreation Area U.S.
Forest Service/National Park Service Inter-
agency Agreement Exhibit Map, Soap Creek
Area’ dated June 2017 is transferred to the
Secretary, to be administered by the Direc-
tor of the National Park Service as Part of
the National Recreation Area.’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 656, the gentleman
from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Colorado.
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I appreciate the opportunity to ad-
dress the Colorado Outdoor Recreation
and Economy Act on the floor. We
want to be able to ensure that the land
being transferred from the Forest Serv-
ice to the National Park Service man-
agement comply with the current
memorandum of understanding.
During testimony before the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources com-
mittee hearing on the CORE Act on
April 2, 2019, Acting Deputy Chief of
the U.S. Forest Service, Chris French,
identified the Soap Creek area within
the Curecanti National Recreation
Area as appropriate for continued ac-
tive forest management, including fuel
treatments, under the existing memo-
randa of understanding between the
Forest Service and the National Parks
Service.
This is a good amendment to be able
to support. I would encourage my col-
leagues to get behind this and hope we
can continue to have the continued co-
operation that we are finally starting
to be able to see on the floor.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chairman, I claim
the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Colorado is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chairman, I oppose
this amendment. It does not reflect
agency recommendations or on-the-
ground support of title IV of this bill.
Veiled behind the claim of compliance
with existing management, this
amendment is contrary to a long-
standing agreement to transfer 2,560
acres of Forest Service land to the Na-
tional Park Service, which is reflected
in the CORE Act as written.
Both agencies have agreed that the
transfer would benefit both the na-
tional recreation area and the national
forest, and the proposal has long en-
joyed broad public support. This
amendment is an attempt to both re-
duce the acreage included in the na-
tional recreation area and to prevent
the most effective management of
these lands.
And I think it is important, Mr.
Chair, because we have talked a lot
about stakeholder involvement, com-
munity-driven processes, and we have
yet to receive any letter opposing a
provision of the bill impacting a coun-
ty in which that county ultimately has
acreage involved; any letter of opposi-
tion. The only letter, in fact, that we
have received of communication is
from Gunnison County. Gunnison
County strongly opposes this amend-
ment. They were never consulted by
the sponsor on this amendment, de-
spite the area in question being in
their county.
So ultimately, I would oppose this
amendment, and I would encourage all
members, respectfully, to vote against
it.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, this is a
current memorandum of under-
standing, something that the Forest
Service itself, Chief Deputy Chris
French, identified as an appropriate
area for continued activities.
You know, one of the big challenges
that we have in the Third Congres-
sional District of Colorado happens to
be forest management. We have seen
forests literally burn to the ground.
Simply to be able to have active, good
forest management, to make sure that
we are standing up, being able to pro-
tect our communities seems to me to
be a sensible approach to be able to ad-
dress something within something as
expansive as the CORE Act.
The gentleman mentioned conversa-
tions with, I assume, a county commis-
sioner out of Gunnison County. We did
have some contact with him today. We
are going to be citing back to him con-
versations he had with our legislative
director on this issue. So there was
communication that had taken place
on this. I would invite the gentleman
to actually come to Montrose County
to be able to visit with people who deal
in the forest products areas, to be able
to see how they are going to respon-
sibly be able to deal with some of the
treatment areas, to be able to protect
our communities, to be able to protect
our watersheds, to be able to protect
endangered species.
I think this is an appropriate amend-
ment to the CORE Act, and I will en-
courage its adoption.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chairman, with
much respect to my colleague from the
Third Congressional District, I have
been to Montrose many times. It is a
beautiful part of our State and there
are wonderful people who call that
community home. What I would say,
again, I find it a bit ironic, with all of

the discussion around local support and
whether or not local communities sup-
port provisions of the bill or do not, on
the one hand, we don’t have a single
communication that I am aware of
from a county that is impacted by a
provision of this bill opposing the title
that impacts that county. We do not
have one.
The only letter of opposition, or the
only communication that we have from
a county opposing any of the matters
that we are discussing today happens
to be a communication from a county
that opposes the amendment offered by
the gentleman. And so, again, I strug-
gle to understand the consistency
there, but nonetheless, contextually I
just want to make sure we fully ex-
plain the rationale behind the 2017
interagency agreement that my distin-
guished friend mentioned, because
ironically enough, the agreement that
the sponsor mentioned that ultimately
the amendment is grounded in for the
purposes of, ‘‘managing recreational fa-
cilities while congressional action is
expected to legislatively establish the
Curecanti National Recreation Area.’’
So in 2008 and 2009 these agencies all
agreed that the transfer of the full
acreage, 2,560 acres, that that was
something they supported, and they
were hoping that Congress would do
something about it. Ten years later, it
is 2019, and we have done nothing. Ulti-
mately, the agencies came together on
an interagency agreement in 2017 to at
least do something in the interim with
the hopes that Congress would step up
and fill the void and codify those pro-
tections, which is precisely the oppor-
tunity that we have now before us.
That is why I oppose this amendment
and would encourage others to do the
same.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, once
again, I appreciate my colleague’s com-
ments, his passion. I am glad he has
been to Montrose to be able to be
there. I hope he spent a lot of money
while he was there. We would appre-
ciate that.
But it is interesting, going back to a
comment that the gentleman made
earlier, that just saying it doesn’t
make it so. We are hearing comments
that there is broad-based support,
there is no opposition. However,
Montrose County, which the gentleman
just cited, they may support a provi-
sion, but they oppose the CORE Act. So
to be able to say there is broad, unani-
mous support is probably something
that I think is not taking into consid-
eration some of the concerns that we
have heard.
I have just held round tables
throughout our district, and there were
concerns. And as I noted in my floor
speech earlier, to be able to see some
support, there is—because there is a lot
of common ground in Colorado. It is
just that we have not gone through all
of the elements to be able to get this
bill to the point where we will have
what I think we would all like to be
able to have, and that is unanimous
consent to be able to move forward.
When we are looking at this specific
amendment—again, this is something
that is being recommended, not by me
but by the Forest Service, when we are
talking about those management pro-
visions to be able to maintain that cur-
rent memorandum of understanding.
This is, I think, something that is
probably important for our area, an
area where I travel, happen to live, and
something that I hope that you will
consider, and you will support.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chair, how much
time do I have remaining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Colorado has 11⁄2 minutes remain-
ing.
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chairman, I would
say, with respect to the technicalities
in terms of active forest management
and the interagency agreement, I sup-
pose we will have to agree to disagree.
And I appreciate the gentleman’s point
and, ultimately, we have clearly landed
on different sides of that issue.
But, again, and I hate to belabor the
point, it is important for those, you
know, who may be watching these pro-
ceedings thousands of miles away back
home in our home State for them to
just appreciate the facts.
So we are clear, there are nine coun-
ties directly impacted by this legisla-
tion. There is one county, in my under-
standing, that my friend from the
Third Congressional District is citing
when he mentions potential opposition
to the bill. But what he is not clari-
fying, or rather what has not been
clarified, is there is no county of those
nine that oppose the provision of the
bill that impacts their community; not
one. We have been here for an hour,
and I have yet to hear of a single coun-
ty, or a town, or a city council for that
matter.
Facts matter. This bill has local sup-
port, and that local support extends to
this title of the bill. The Gunnison
County commissioners and the commu-
nity in Gunnison have made that clear,
which is why I would urge a ‘‘no’’ vote
on this amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, we often
hear the comment on this floor on pub-
lic lands bills: These lands belong to all
Americans. I appreciate and I do re-
spect the support for the CORE Act in
terms of the individual communities,
but I think it belies the lifestyle on the
western slope of Colorado, in par-
ticular. The people that traverse, work
within different counties, feel the im-
pacts on their businesses, have the im-
pact of water flowing through those
communities coming from another
county, those are the issues that I
think, unfortunately, are not taken
into consideration by this bill.
I urge support of this amendment. It
is a good piece of work to be able to
make sure that we are dealing with
good forest management.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, I de-
mand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Colorado will be
postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 6 OFFERED BY MR. CROW
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 6 printed in
part B of House Report 116–264.
Mr. CROW. Mr. Chairman, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 37, after line 19, insert the following:
(g) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that military aviation training on
Federal public lands in Colorado, including
the training conducted at the High-Altitude
Army National Guard Aviation Training
Site, is critical to the national security of
the United States and the readiness of the
Armed Forces.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 656, the gentleman
from Colorado (Mr. CROW) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Colorado.
Mr. CROW. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I rise today to highlight the Colorado
Army National Guard’s High-Altitude
Aviation Training Site, or HAATS, a
program that all members of the Colo-
rado delegation value deeply and sup-
port.
HAATS offers a hands-on experience
for helicopter pilots in the science of
flying at high altitudes where air pres-
sure is significantly lower, and engines
run hotter. Learning these skills is
critical to successfully execute mili-
tary operations and rescue missions in
mountain terrain.
Each year HAATS trains over 400 air
crews from all branches and compo-
nents, including the National Guard,
the Army, Army Reserves, and allies
around the globe.
As a combat veteran, I served three
tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, two of
which were in Afghanistan where the
terrain is rugged, unforgiving, and high
altitude. The pilots with whom I served
received HAATS training. Their skill,
composure under pressure, and dedica-
tion is worthy of our praise.
With this amendment we honor the
HAATS mission and recognize how cru-
cial that mission is to our national se-
curity and the readiness of our Armed
Forces.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8665
October 30, 2019
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, I ask
unanimous consent to claim the time
in opposition, although I am not op-
posed to this amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection
to the request of the gentleman from
Colorado?
There was no objection.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Colorado is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
b 1945
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chair, I genuinely
appreciate my colleague’s position on
this. In fact, he will probably recall,
and I believe he voted for—and our col-
league from Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE) did
as well—my amendment, to be able to
recognize the importance of this issue
to the national defense of the United
States. We passed that through. 417–6,
as I recall, was the vote total that was
on there.
So I applaud the recognition of the
importance of high-altitude training
facilities.
Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague, Mr.
CROW, for his service to this country.
That is the importance of people being
able and willing to put their lives on
the line for this Nation, but we do
need, I think, ultimately, to be able to
go one step further.
While this recognizes the importance
of it, it does not codify it. That is
something that I think is really essen-
tial to making sure that the men and
women in the United States military
have the safest opportunities to be able
to do the training that they need to be
able to carry out the missions of this
country.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. CROW. Mr. Chair, I appreciate
the comments of my friend from Colo-
rado. This is certainly an example of
the Colorado delegation working to-
gether, talking and collaborating, try-
ing to figure out the best path forward
for our State and the interests of all of
our districts.
This is an issue, as I talked about
earlier, that is very personal to me. I
served in Afghanistan, and like I men-
tioned earlier, the pilots with whom I
served received this critical training.
My life and the life of my soldiers re-
lied on this training being conducted
and the important mission that
HAATS performs every year for all of
our services.
But I also learned something else in
the Army that—and you don’t have to
take my word for it—one of the best
ways to get information, the best way
to figure out what the soldiers and the
troops need, is you talk to the folks on
the ground, you talk to the folks on
the front line.
Mr. Chair, I applaud the work of Sen-
ator BENNET and my very good friend
and colleague Congressman JOE
NEGUSE for doing just that, reaching
out to our military commanders.
I want to read, very briefly, a letter
that was sent to them by Major Gen-
eral Michael Loh, who not only is a
pilot but is the commander of the Colo-
rado National Guard. He said:
I am writing to express the support of the
Colorado Department of Military and Vet-
erans Affairs for the Colorado Outdoor
Recreation and Economy Act through the
diligent efforts of staff within the depart-
ment, the offices of the bill’s sponsors, and
the Department of Defense, who have miti-
gated prior concerns related to military
overflight of the potential wilderness areas
identified in the bill.
That is our commander. That is our
top commander of the Colorado Na-
tional Guard that manages this facil-
ity, the pilots, and the training that
occurs, saying: Thank you. You did
your work. The delegation reached out.
You have mitigated our concerns. Move
forward.
What else do we need other than that
word of our commanders? JOE NEGUSE
and MICHAEL BENNET worked very hard
to make sure they were addressing the
concerns, and we should take their
word for it, not ours.
Mr. Chair, I yield as much time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE), my friend.
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chair, I want to
say a deep note of gratitude to my dis-
tinguished colleague and my good
friend from Colorado (Mr. CROW), who
served our country so bravely and so
honorably. We are all deeply grateful
for his service in the Armed Forces
and, of course, his service today in this
Chamber.
I don’t know that I could say it any
better than he did. I believe that this
amendment reaffirms the support that
we have for HAATS across our Colo-
rado delegation and for the reasons he
already so eloquently stated.
I think, ultimately, any further codi-
fication, as my colleague from the
Third Congressional District had ref-
erenced, would be a solution in search
of a problem.
Mr. Chair, I encourage every Member
of this Chamber to support Mr. CROW’s
important amendment.
Mr. CROW. Mr. Chair, in closing, I
would like to stress again the impor-
tance of honoring HAATS and its crit-
ical mission.
In July, I was pleased to join 416 of
my colleagues, including Mr. TIPTON,
in voting for an amendment that has
language that we can all get behind.
Again, I reiterate the fact that you
don’t have to take anyone’s word for it
sitting here having this debate tonight.
The commanders on the ground, the
people managing this facility, man-
aging the pilots, in fact, the pilot him-
self with the responsibility to make
sure that this mission has to go for-
ward, have blessed this effort and said
that their concerns are mitigated and
that they are happy to support this ef-
fort.
So we, I think, owe it to our generals,
to our soldiers, and to our troops to
defer to their better judgment on this
because they know this better than we
do.
Mr. Chair, I am very happy to sup-
port this amendment, and I urge all
others to support it.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. CROW).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chair, I demand a
recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Colorado will be
postponed.
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Chair, I move that
the Committee do now rise.
The motion was agreed to.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.
CROW) having assumed the chair, Mr.
PAPPAS, Acting Chair of the Com-
mittee of the Whole House on the state
of the Union, reported that that Com-
mittee, having had under consideration
the bill (H.R. 823) to provide for the
designation of certain wilderness areas,
recreation management areas, and con-
servation areas in the State of Colo-
rado, and for other purposes, had come
to no resolution thereon.

RECOGNIZING DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, Octo-
ber is Domestic Violence Awareness
Month, and I rise today in support of
those who have experienced domestic
abuse.
Over 73,000 Tennesseans were victims
of domestic violence last year. Sadly,
many victims struggle for support
after experiencing violence.
In Tennessee, and across America,
victims of domestic violence are often-
times afraid to speak up about their
abuse. Even worse, sometimes victims
are not able to receive the help they
need. This is unacceptable.
Communities across America must
create safe environments for victims of
domestic violence and encourage them
to seek assistance.
Local organizations and shelters are
always ready to help. As elected offi-
cials, we have a responsibility to make
sure our constituents are aware of
these resources.
I am proud to partner with the
YWCA, which employs a good friend of
mine, Maggie McNally, whose father I
worked with for over 15 years in Nash-
ville and who now is the speaker of the
Tennessee State Senate, to raise
awareness for Domestic Violence
Awareness Month.
The YWCA and organizations like it
are committed to ending domestic vio-
lence in our communities, and I fully
support them in their mission.

SUPPORT THOSE WITH DOWN
SYNDROME
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to bring attention to Down Syn-
drome Awareness Month.
Down Syndrome occurs when abnor-
mal cell division results in a duplicate
of chromosome 21. However, those suf-
fering from this disease are anything
but abnormal, and it is time that they
be viewed as valued members of our
communities.
Although there is no cure or preven-
tion for Downs, there are still nations
working to eradicate the disease using
the only means available to them,
through the willful abortion of babies
identified as having Down Syndrome
during prenatal screenings.
Iceland is an example of a country
where almost all women who receive a
positive test result for Down Syndrome
terminate their pregnancies at the rec-
ommendation of their medical practi-
tioners.
Those with Down Syndrome can and
should be given the opportunity to live
full lives. They can be educated and
employed. They exude joy and grace,
with the most lovable personalities.
Just ask their family and friends.
It is time for the world to stop being
complicit in the genocide of those with
Down Syndrome and to support our
friends born with an extra chro-
mosome. All life has value.

HONORING MARINE CORPS RE-
SERVE PFC KENNETH W. LIKENS
(Mr. LEVIN of Michigan asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,
last week, I experienced one of the true
honors of my time in Congress. I par-
ticipated in the burial of Marine Corps
Reserve Private First Class Kenneth W.
Likens of Mount Clemens, Michigan.
Private Likens died fighting to pro-
tect the freedoms of all of us on the
third day of the Battle of Tarawa Atoll
in the Gilbert Islands in the Pacific
theater during World War II.
Incredibly, his remains, which have
been missing for 75 years, were identi-
fied in May, thanks to the tireless and
underappreciated efforts of Hero
Flight, which refuses to give up the
fight to bring democracy’s heroes
home.
I was so moved to attend this dig-
nified and solemn ceremony at Great
Lakes National Cemetery in Holly,
Michigan, and to meet PFC Likens’
nearest surviving relative, Kenneth
Dolan, who was named for his uncle,
the lost soldier.
PFC Likens is lost no more. He now
rests in peace where he belongs, in the
land of the free and the home of the
brave.
STATE OF OUR MANUFACTURING
ECONOMY
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
PAPPAS). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the
gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. STE-
VENS) is recognized for 60 minutes as
the designee of the majority leader.
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
within this Chamber this evening to
give an address on the state of our
manufacturing economy. It is certainly
very significant to do so this evening
in the well of our House of Representa-
tives, one of the more sacred and dis-
tinct places of our democracy, where
we deliberate, exchange, and make our
Nation’s laws.
Certainly, the weight of a great his-
tory is also upon us, and some profound
and oftentimes troubling questions are
asked of us. How do we make govern-
ment work for the people we represent?
How do we restore trust, faith, and ac-
countability in our Federal Govern-
ment?
Henry Clay once said that govern-
ment is a trust, and those elected into
office, into Federal Government, are
its trustees, and they work together for
the benefit of the people.
We hear and see the aching headlines
of dysfunction, of inability, of stagna-
tion, questions around progress and
where we seek and look to go. Trust in
government is at its lowest levels, ac-
cording to Pew.
We are waiting for an infrastructure
deal. We are waiting for tenets of social
justice, of economic justice, of equal
opportunity for education.
This House of Representatives in this
116th Congress has passed some re-
markable bills, over 200, in fact, bills
that colleagues who preceded me
worked for years to get to the House
floor. Now, the American public waits
for those bills to become law, to be
passed through our Senate, to be
signed into law. That is why we are
here today.
It is very intentional this evening
that I speak from the well of this Con-
gress to whoever may be listening.
The facts are also upon us. Today,
the Federal Reserve cut interest rates
for the third time this year as the U.S.
economy continues to slow down amid
‘‘ongoing trade disputes and weak glob-
al growth.’’
b 2000
For is it such a fact that 98 percent of
the world’s consumer base exists out-
side of the United States that we are in
a race to sell our best-in-class product
from our best-in-class workforce to the
international markets before us.
We are closing out this decade in just
a few short weeks. It feels like months.
We are entering into a new decade, and
we are asking ourselves what our com-
petitiveness agenda will be.
Tariffs, the tariff war that we are in
so far has cost U.S. businesses $34 bil-
lion since January 2018. Individual
households are now at risk to pay hun-
dreds more for consumer goods as they
are increasingly impacted by this trade
war: individual households, our Amer-
ican middle class, bearing the burden
of this fallacious trade war.
Yes, we need to be tough on China.
Yes, we need accountability. Yes, we
need to take on illegal dumping and
currency manipulation and strong-
arming and the taking of our IP, but
we need to do so in a way that posi-
tions us for success, that positions the
American middle class on a trajectory
for growth and reclaims what we have
lost since the mid-1990s. That income,
median income, has not increased since
the mid-1990s. That rests upon us as an
economic charge.
Today, industrial activity is at its
lowest point since June 2009—an Earth-
shattering year, by the way, in the
middle of a Great Recession—today,
with productivity inventories and new
orders falling.
I represent these manufacturers in
southeastern Michigan. I represent a
shining, incredible asset, the most ro-
bust supply chain of auto manufactur-
ers in the country. I have devoted this
first year in my first term in Congress
hand in hand with these small busi-
nesses, with these midsize companies
who employ countless people who live
in the neighborhoods, who send their
children to the schools I represent.
To the other service businesses who
benefit from this strong economy, why
get in the way of growth?
So far, Michigan has lost 6,200 fac-
tory jobs. And we are not the only
State with this type of industry as its
lifeblood that is showing signs of a
slowdown: States like Ohio, which has
also shed 2,400 manufacturing jobs;
Pennsylvania has 9,100 fewer manufac-
turing workers.
I hear from these individuals, these
small firms, and they are wondering
what it is going to take to reignite in-
vestment in our workforce and invest-
ment in them. A trade war that we
have now spent more in agricultural
subsidies than we have on the entire
U.S. auto rescue.
The auto rescue was not a man-made
crisis. It was part of a larger economic
conundrum, a set of economic policies
that set us on a trajectory of near im-
plosion, of implosion of our financial
banking, insurance, housing.
And the lifeblood of our industrial
base and good, bipartisan policy-
making, of which I was a part of, came
together to save the auto industry—
200,000 Michigan jobs, millions more
across the country—an auto industry
that is humming on incredible and re-
markable innovation today. I know
this. I see it.
Some more facts: 2 to 1 patents in au-
tonomous vehicle technology coming
out of my district; 75 percent of the
R&D; rampant proliferation of electric
vehicle technology going into indus-
trial parks and seeing what is akin to,
and nothing short of, an innovation
renaissance.
We are waiting for the electric vehi-
cle tax credit bill. We are waiting for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8667
October 30, 2019
an economic policy not of resistance,
not of fighting, but of positioning us
for success.
The statistics and the facts and the
headlines are real, and they mean
something in Michigan’s 11th District
to the manufacturer in Livonia, to the
small business in Novi, to the hub of
automobile manufacturing taking
place in Auburn Hills, that I–75 cor-
ridor. And yet we want to compete; we
want to sell; we want the investment
in our American workforce.
Who and how are we paying for it?
This is a referendum on our economic
policy that is coming from agencies
and administrators whom the body
that I serve in has oversight appro-
priating and authorizing authority
over.
Our Federal deficit has swelled to
nearly $1 trillion. It is basically at $1
trillion in this year. It happened quiet-
ly. It was maybe a peep of a headline.
We can’t even fathom what a $1 trillion
deficit in this country means.
This isn’t to shame any individual
about their spending habits, because, I
guarantee you, any of my colleagues
engaging in such personal egregious be-
havior would be declared bankrupt and
unfit for office.
Our Nation cannot function with a $1
trillion deficit for the long-term. It
comes at the expense of every Amer-
ican, and particularly an undue and
saddled burden to the next generation,
to those under the age of 18 who cannot
even place a vote yet and are counting
on us to enact policies.
So when the headlines start to rum-
ble, of which they have, about a manu-
facturing slowdown, about an acute
manufacturing recession, how can that
be when we have such incredible inno-
vations proliferating? It is because we
have not reconciled our economic pol-
icy. It is because we have not embraced
an economic policy for the middle class
as a whole of government.
Our Democratic Caucus has, our
Democratic Caucus reverberating the
mantra of ‘‘for the people.’’ That
mantra has a value for the people be-
cause, you see, this tax cut that we
passed last Congress, that was passed
last Congress without a Democratic
vote, 80 percent of it going to the larg-
est corporations, not doing anything
for our middle class, not doing any-
thing for our small and midsize manu-
facturers.
Remember that headline, ‘‘Cuts to
Research Funding,’’ sending us a gen-
eration back on scientific research. It
is one of the reasons, as a sub-
committee chair for the Research and
Technology Subcommittee, we have
had over a dozen hearings around how
to manifest our country’s research and
technology agenda for inclusive
growth.
Productivity. Erik Brynjolfsson, MIT
professor and author of a great book on
the future of work in the digital age of
manufacturing, recently testified in
front of my committee, declaring sev-
eral things which are of note to this
body. He declared, his research, the re-
search, the primary facts that drive
these headlines, our research tells us
that we face two urgent economic chal-
lenges: a lack of productivity growth
and too much inequality.
What do we do next? How do we re-
claim this agenda of economic rights,
of economic growth for everybody?
As Mr. Brynjolfsson went on to say in
his testimony, for two centuries since
1776, since ‘‘The Wealth of Nations’’
was written, Americans benefited as we
created an economic system that gen-
erated shared prosperity. But, over the
past several decades, the benefits of
economic growth have been much more
unequal.
Not only has median income barely
grown since the 1990s, as I previously
stated, but other social indicators,
have worsened. Deaths from despair,
namely, suicide, drug addiction are
skyrocketing. We also know that life
expectancy has declined in this coun-
try for the third year in a row.
He goes on to say that these chal-
lenges, this schism of inequality and
lack of productivity can be solved.
I have taken up that challenge and
believe that a middle-class economic
agenda can reverse course for us, rein-
vesting in public education, making
higher education affordable, on-ramps
and pathways to opportunities for the
skilled workforce, tax credits for com-
panies that want to do on-the-job
training.
For is it not the case that our work-
force spectrum, our future, those stu-
dents being educated for the jobs that
they are in demand to fill and those in
the existing workplace who are swing-
ing through the jungle gym of opportu-
nities, making their way at their place
of employment, they represent who we
should be investing in.
They represent a phenomenal oppor-
tunity for us to support not the house-
hold name businesses, but the busi-
nesses that want to train those work-
ers and deserve credit for doing so, the
businesses that want to sell—I have a
lot of them in Michigan who want to
sell their products internationally—
giving them the opportunity to do so
through good policy that invests in
global citizenry, invests in global out-
look, and allows us to bring American
innovation to the world.
The plight of American greatness in
the post-9/11 era has been the plight of
innovation that we, as Americans, pro-
liferated the internet, the use of infor-
mation technology that is captured on
the internet. It started in the late
nineties with less than 10 percent of in-
formation technology on the internet.
By the year 2007, 98 percent, and then
today, an entirely different internet.
b 2015
We now talk about the Internet of
Things, the interconnectedness of de-
vices through the technology and the
wireless networks, which have a great
and profound benefit to our manufac-
turers in Michigan. We are leaders in
this industrial Internet of Things
space. We are designing, producing,
making, and shipping in ways that we
never have before, and it needs to be
shared, the prosperity. That is, what
we know, we all want.
So we look to revive some of the suc-
cessful economic policies of 10 years
ago, of pieces of legislation like the
States’ small business JOBS Act that
spurred investment of American prod-
ucts into international markets.
We also raised the question of supply-
chain security. This is particularly im-
portant to those of us in Michigan, in
Metro Detroit, recognizing how impor-
tant that supply chain was in World
War II. We manufactured our way to a
new world order, to the ringing notions
of freedom that we helped to usher in
throughout the West, creating a sys-
tem of government that was admired
and bestowed and that grew our middle
class.
We recognize the troubling dilemma
that we have with our rare earth min-
erals. In May, China, frustrated,
threatened to cut off supply to the U.S.
as part of the U.S. trade war, supply of
these rare earth minerals that go into
our devices that secure the production
of some of our incredible innovations,

America depends on China for 80 per-
cent of its rare earth imports, and that
is not a desirable position to be in. We
must reclaim our supply chain. We
have to reclaim or categorize an agen-
da for rare earth minerals.
The global rare earth market is pro-
jected to grow in value from $8.1 billion
to $14.4 billion by 2025, as driven by the
demand for electric vehicles, cell
phones, and other products.
Here is a story of a manufacturer in
Michigan, a company in Northville
called soulbrain MI, that develops and
delivers quality lithium-ion electro-
lytes in steel cases—which they are
paying tens and tens of thousands more
for, not realizing a profit—which is a
core component of the lithium-ion bat-
teries that go into our electric vehi-
cles.
It is just one of two producers that
we have in the United States, and yet
they pay the price because of the poli-
cies, the overregulation, and the fail-
ure to support the small businesses and
the manufacturers. The subsidies have
gone to agriculture. And there was not
one investment or change for our man-
ufacturers, albeit, the several great
pieces of legislation that we have
passed out of the Science, Space, and
Technology Committee.
Many of my colleagues are paying at-
tention to this. Many of them are
working on this, but we need the legis-
lation to come to the floor. We need it
to be voted on in the Senate, and we
need to usher in a new manufacturing
agenda.
The world is demanding our electric
vehicles. It is demanding our tech-
nology. It is demanding our manufac-
turing.
Let’s revive the great ability to sell
our products.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8668 October 30, 2019
Let’s revive the great ability to advo-
cate on behalf of our labor force, our
21st century labor movement.
Let’s reconcile the reality of today’s
economy and policies that have been
19th or 20th century proposed solutions
to 21st century problems, and let’s get
smart about how to win and compete
again. It is a new era that begets a new
trade orientation for us.
Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss in
this Special Order hour, of which I am
reeling with passion for our manufac-
turing economy and have profound ex-
citement and only want to see it suc-
ceed through an economic agenda that
I believe this House majority can usher
in, that I believe that this Congress-
woman from Michigan’s 11th Congres-
sional District can champion the great
requests, but I would be remiss to leave
out, in these remarks, another moment
and marker in time as we will close out
session tomorrow and resume our in-
district work activity, recognizing that
we will be hitting 1 year since this
116th Congress was elected—and how
magnificent this year has been.
With so much energy and gusto, we
made our way to freshman orientation
shortly after that election—less than a
week after—meeting our colleagues,
meeting our deliberators, meeting
those, the small, collective composite
of us, the 435 of us in this House Cham-
ber who are charged with making this
Federal Government work for the
American people.
Let me say, by the way, that this
manufacturing agenda has tremendous
return on investment should we so
choose to embrace it as a nation. We
know our House majority is ushering it
in. We know we are balancing the equi-
ties and advocating for all components
of a good trade deal, inspired by the
Buy American content, pushing for the
enforcement standards, embracing the
need for certainty to come to our small
and midsized manufacturers, the manu-
facturers in Michigan’s 11th Congres-
sional District, the people who are
wondering: How will my taxpayer dol-
lars work for me?
It has been an incredible moment in
time to be a part of this 116th Con-
gress. And while we will not be to-
gether as a body on both sides of the
aisle to look at each other and to rec-
ognize what has happened in a year
since what sometimes feels like dra-
matic action with elections, we can re-
flect on some of the moments that of-
tentimes don’t even make it into news
headlines or Twitter feeds or proclama-
tions from Members of Congress, but
ways in which we have embraced this
new orientation of government in the
Democratic House majority of our For
the People agenda: bringing up issues
for the labor movement, whether you
belong to a union or not, for our middle
class; the long overdue passage of
Butch Lewis, the Butch Lewis Act,
bringing the pensions of many to sol-
vency, a classic example of doing noth-
ing is greater than the cost of doing
something; solving people’s problems,
making their taxpayer dollars work,
not forcing small businesses to feel a
pinch, not looking job layoffs in the
face but saying, ‘‘We are investing in
you.’’
We are championing legislation and
policy that embraces and puts people
at the forefront, those who are not
armed with the biggest lobbyists or the
fanciest offices but who are counting
on those who hold the stewardship of
trust to deliver for them.
We will also recognize, in this 1-year
anniversary mark—without being in
one another’s presence—that we still
have a lot of work to do.
The bipartisan elixir, in my humble
opinion, is our manufacturing econ-
omy. It is our ability to make things.
It is our ability to help the people
whom I have spoken to directly, whose
factory floors I have walked on, whose
office rooms I have sat in looking at
that pathway to growth, not disinvest-
ment.
Too many have told me: We have had
to invest elsewhere, we have had to re-
move ourselves from deals. We need to
be competing effectively as a continent
with the rest of the world. We need to
take Asia by storm because we know
they want our goods. We know they
want our innovations. And it is that
ability to do original research, the ‘‘if
not but for the Federal Government’’
approach to basic research investment
that catalyzes and proliferates new
technologies of scale.
I am looking forward, Mr. Speaker,
to continuing to learn and to grow and
to advocate fiercely on behalf of my
economy in Michigan’s 11th Congres-
sional District for the betterment and
the semblance of our future.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
f
FULL-SCALE IMPEACHMENT
HISTORY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Iowa
(Mr. KING) is recognized for 60 minutes
as the designee of the minority leader.
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is
an honor to be recognized as I address
you here on the floor of the House of
Representatives, and I appreciate all
the eyes and ears that are paying at-
tention here this evening as we take up
this most serious business that this
Congress has only addressed three pre-
vious times in the history of the
United States of America.
As we go back through American an-
tiquity, we will see that there was an
impeachment process that was ad-
vanced shortly after the Civil War with
Andrew Johnson as President.
Then we sat back for over a century
before there was another issue that
arose, and that was in 1974 with the im-
peachment effort of Richard Nixon,
who resigned before he faced the judg-
ment of this United States Congress.
Then, in 1998, I happen to have been
here in this city, not an elected Mem-
ber of Congress, Mr. Speaker, but I
came here into this city as a State sen-
ator from Iowa to an allied conference.
As I opened up the newspaper, I saw in
there that it said that there are im-
peachment hearings taking place in
room 2141 of the Rayburn House Office
Building for the dates of December 7, 8,
and 9 of 1998.
I concluded that whatever was going
on in that conference wasn’t as impor-
tant as me being seated there in that
Judiciary Committee as a spectator to
be able to witness the unfolding acts of
history as the House of Representa-
tives passed judgment upon then-Presi-
dent Bill Clinton.
As I listened to the testimony, and,
of course, Mr. Speaker, I had been
watching on television many of the
other open public hearings that had
taken place before the House Judiciary
Committee, I was pretty well informed
as to the charges that were being
brought against Bill Clinton.
b 2400
As I listened to that debate in those
3 days, December 7, 8, and 9 of 1998, I
watched some other things go on
around me that I would not have
picked up if I had just been watching
the committee hearings on C–SPAN. I
remember Representative Barney
Frank coming into the room. He want-
ed to ask questions of the witness and
make his statement. They advised him
that he had to have a tie on before he
could be recognized. Then he went out
and borrowed a tie from someone and
made a big show out of tying that tie
before he was recognized to speak be-
fore the Judiciary Committee.
I recall also that Democrats, in par-
ticular—in fact exclusively—didn’t ap-
pear to be taking it seriously. When
they were off the sight of the camera,
they were joking, laughing, and cut-
ting up outside the scenes. I thought
that that was not the decorum that we
should have when we have the most se-
rious of constitutional issues before us,
the very impeachment of a President of
the United States and the prospect
that that impeached President—rel-
atively soon to be impeached Presi-
dent—would be standing trial before
the United States Senate to determine
whether the acts that he had been ac-
cused of, not convicted of, but accused
of in the form of an indictment out of
the House of Representatives, whether
he was guilty of those violations,
which by my recollection were perjury,
subornation of perjury, and obstruction
of justice.
It seems to me those were the three
charges that made their way out the
center aisle here in the House of Rep-
resentatives and over to the United
States Senate where Chief Justice
Rehnquist presided over a trial in the
United States Senate.
The question was: Was President
Clinton guilty of the charges that were
brought against him right here in this
House of Representatives?
And if he was guilty, did those viola-
tions that he was found guilty of rise

to the level that he should be removed
from office and put Al Gore in as Presi-
dent of the United States?
That was the question before the
United States Senate. It was profound.
I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, it broke
my heart to see how this country was
torn apart over the disrespect in the
Oval Office, the disrespect for the
United States, and the disrespect for
the Constitution and the decorum of
the Presidency. I had a difficult time
retaining my composure when I went
back to Iowa to talk about what I had
seen.
I recall going out to Arlington Ceme-
tery during that time and making my
way up the hill and walking around
over to the eternal flame at the grave
of President John F. Kennedy. Very
close to him now, of course, is the
grave of Bobby Kennedy, and not very
far away is the grave of Teddy Ken-
nedy, the three brothers who served
this country so well. I remember stand-
ing with my back to that eternal flame
and looking down across Arlington
Cemetery and all the crosses that were
there, around 285,000 of them at the
time, and looking at the bridge that
goes over the Potomac and on down the
Mall. If you know where to look, Mr.
Speaker, it is a little bit out of center,
but you can tell where the White House
is from President Kennedy’s grave.
I thought about the caisson with
President Kennedy’s casket winding its
way down Pennsylvania Avenue, wind-
ing its way out across the Potomac
River, winding its way out to Arling-
ton, and winding its way up to that
place on the hill where I was standing
where President John F. Kennedy was
buried with the eternal flame still
burning and still blazing there on that
location never having been snuffed out.
I thought about a country that was
full of grief for losing a President to
the atrocity of the assassination of
John F. Kennedy and what that meant,
the blow to our Republic, the blow to
the history of America, and the blow to
the heart and soul of our country that
took place when Lee Harvey Oswald
pulled that trigger down in Dallas that
day.
I thought about what our country
had gone through from 1963 until that
year in 1998, when we had gone from
grieving for a President lost and aspi-
rations not achieved because of a Presi-
dent lost, to a place where we have a
President elected who, I believe, so
disrespected the office that he con-
ducted himself in it and next to it in a
way that was never imagined by our
Founding Fathers and in a way that I
won’t describe here on the floor of the
House of Representatives.
It washed over me on that day, Mr.
Speaker, what had taken place and
what had been taking place in the Oval
Office of the President of the United
States and the rooms adjoining the
Oval Office, the disrespect and in a way
the desecration of that respect for the
office that we so embrace and hold so
dear.
It was so difficult for us to say good-
bye to President Kennedy and not that
many years later put our Nation
through this impeachment hearing of a
President who, I believe, did lie under
oath, did direct others to lie under
oath, and did obstruct justice along the
way.
There were four charges brought to
him here on the floor of the House of
Representatives. I believe three of
them were presented over in the United
States Senate. I haven’t looked that up
in a long time. It is not a place I like
to go revisit very often, Mr. Speaker.
I recall also that the decision was
made here in the House of Representa-
tives that said that we are impeaching
the President of the United States for
his activities with an intern and his re-
fusal to tell the truth about them when
he is under oath, that the trial took
place over in the United States Senate.
I think of my junior Senator at the
time, Tom Harkin, whom I have had a
good personal relationship with him,
watching him on C–SPAN—as every
Senator had to do, Mr. Speaker—walk
down the center aisle of the United
States Senate, as if walking down here
to this table right beside me with a
large book there. On that large book it
said:
I do hereby pledge to do impartial justice
under the law and the Constitution of the
United States of America, so help me God.
Each Senator was required to sign
that book that they would do impartial
justice. That meant they took the posi-
tion of jurors to determine whether
Bill Clinton was guilty of perjury, of
obstruction of justice, of subornation
of perjury, to listen to the evidence
that was presented before the United
States Senate and come to an objective
conclusion as to whether they believed
that President Clinton had violated the
law in those areas. And the second
question was, and if so, does it rise to
the level that he should be removed
from office?
He was already impeached, Mr.
Speaker, but does it rise to the level
that he should be removed from office?
Our Founding Fathers in the Con-
stitution gave us those standards to in-
terpret in our time. The wisdom of our
Founding Fathers just amazes me time
after time, how they left the language
in such a way that we got to decide, in
the context of contemporary values,
whether or not the violations that I be-
lieve were committed by President Bill
Clinton rose to the level that he should
be removed from office.
As I said, my junior Senator walked
down that aisle—as did 99 other Sen-
ators—and signed the book to do im-
partial justice under the law and under
the Constitution. He walked back up
that center aisle, he stepped out those
double doors outside the Senate Cham-
ber straight down through the rotunda
where we are today, stepped up to the
microphones, and he said: I will never
vote to remove Bill Clinton from office.
No matter what, I will not vote to re-
move Bill Clinton from office.
The ink wasn’t dry on his pledge to
do impartial justice under the law and
the Constitution, and he already took a
pledge not to do impartial justice
under the law and the Constitution. He
had already drawn his conclusions.
Here is what happened with many of
the Democrats that would refuse to
vote to remove Bill Clinton from office:
they stepped out before those same
microphones over and over again and
said—because the question was such as:
Is he guilty and should be removed
from office, all what wrapped up in one.
Then the question was, Mr. Speaker,
for them, they said: Well, I didn’t have
to decide whether he had actually com-
mitted perjury or obstruction of justice
or subornation of perjury, because even
if he had, I didn’t think it rose to the
level that he should be removed from
office.
Time after time the Democrats who
voted to protect President Bill Clinton
from being removed from office made
the same statement: No matter wheth-
er he is guilty or not of perjury, ob-
struction of justice, or subornation of
perjury, so what? It didn’t rise to the
level that he should be removed from
office.
So they voted to protect his position
in office, even though we had a Vice
President whom they liked and re-
spected, and I think would have made a
reasonably decent President during
that period of time.
But they held that ground, I believe,
for partisan reasons, Mr. Speaker. Now,
the legacy of that history echoes back
over here to the House of Representa-
tives and may echo back to the United
States Senate again, if whatever a
President is charged with, no matter
whether he is guilty or not, doesn’t rise
to the level that he should be removed
from office, then I guess the Senate is
not going to remove him from office by
a two-thirds vote margin which is re-
quired by the Constitution.
So let’s apply those values today.
Let’s apply the Bill Clinton values
today, and they come back to be this:
that if the charges that actually don’t
exist yet against Donald Trump are
some charges that are lesser than the
charges that were leveled against
President Bill Clinton, then how do
these Senators—some of whom are still
there from 1998—how could they vote
to remove Donald Trump from office in
the United States Senate if they can’t
even find a charge in the House of Rep-
resentatives—and they have been
churning around here for nearly 3 years
looking for charges they can impeach
him with—if they can’t come up with a
charge that is perjury, obstruction of
justice, or subornation of perjury?
The biggest thing they have charged
him with is collusion, and that is a
laugher. The definition of collusion is
pretty vague. If you and I team up to-
gether, Mr. Speaker, and we go out and
set up a business enterprise, somebody
will say we are colluding. If I say: I am
going to sell lemonade at a stand on
the corner of Fourth and Vine; and you

say: I am going to sell lemonade on the
corner of Fifth and Vine, that is collu-
sion.
It is no crime, and it is no violation
of our moral standards either, Mr.
Speaker.
Whatever charges at this point have
been speculated against President
Trump are nowhere near that which I
believe Bill Clinton was guilty of but
not convicted and removed from office.
But we never found out. The jury in the
Senate never gave us a verdict on the
violations of President Bill Clinton.
They wrapped him up in the same ques-
tion: Did he commit perjury?
Democrats said: Well, who knows? It
doesn’t matter. I didn’t have to answer
that question, because I didn’t think he
should be removed from office even if
he had.
Time after time Senators signed the
document, walked back, and decided,
as Tom Harkin did, I will never vote to
remove Bill Clinton from office, even
though I just signed a document that
said that I will do impartial justice
under the law.
I am saying this, Mr. Speaker, be-
cause this impeachment process that
we are in the middle of now is a very
politicized operation and organization.
Look at the votes that will come
down here to the floor of the House of
Representatives tomorrow. The Rules
Committee met tonight, and they had
their dialogue going on there. They are
going to bring an impeachment resolu-
tion down here. We are going to have a
debate on the rule, we are going to
vote, and it is likely going to be a clear
partisan vote—Republicans on one side
voting ‘‘no,’’ Democrats on the other
side voting ‘‘yes.’’
They don’t have to believe it, they
just know which jersey they have on.
I am not asserting that Republicans
don’t conduct themselves in a similar
way. Instead, I am asserting this, this
is a partisan operation, and they cal-
culate that they could bring these
charges against the President of the
United States, and in the effort to im-
peach the President find a way to tie
his hands so he can’t be as effective as
the people who elected Donald Trump
want, pray, and expect him to be.
I would take us back to this election
that took place and the many hearings
wherein I have questioned the wit-
nesses before the House Judiciary Com-
mittee. Some of the witnesses whom I
have questioned under oath go back to
be, let’s see, Janet Napolitano, Loretta
Lynch, Rod Rosenstein, Christopher
Wray, and James Comey. The list goes
on. Peter Strzok would be one of those
people. Another one I listened to would
be Lisa Page. I don’t believe I ever
asked her a question, but I have lis-
tened to her testify. They put this
whole scenario together. The texts that
went back and forth between Peter
Strzok and Lisa Page told us what was
going on.
They had weaponized the FBI,
weaponized the Department of Justice,
weaponized the State Department, and
weaponized the CIA, the branches of
government that were mobilized to at-
tack not only Conservatives and Re-
publicans, but to attack the candidate
for President, Donald Trump, who said
during that period of time he believed
that he had been wiretapped in Trump
Towers in New York.
That turns out to be true. The only
way the left can argue with that, Mr.
Speaker, is that they say that the defi-
nition of wiretap really doesn’t apply
anymore because we have so much
wireless that we are not actually wire-
tapping we are just doing surveillance.
An archaic term, though most re-
cently archaic, doesn’t mean President
Trump wasn’t right. He understood he
was being bugged in the Trump Towers.
Once he was advised of that by an ad-
miral, Admiral Rogers, he moved his
operations as President-elect out of
Trump Towers in New York out to the
golf course in New Jersey, where he
could operate with a level of confidence
that he wasn’t being bugged in every
conversation that he had.
But there was a concerted effort, and
it is a matter of fact today proven and
not reasonably disputed that there was
a sincere effort on the part of a good
number of people at the highest levels
of the Department of Justice, the FBI,
the CIA, and the State Department to
neuter this President by any means
possible.
b 2045
They tried to do so with their under-
cutting of his campaign prior to the
election in November 2016, and they
continued to undercut this President
as President-elect and as President of
the United States.
So I am going to give a little piece of
factual history here, Mr. Speaker. And
that would be this: President Trump
was elected, became President-elect, on
the Tuesday prior to November 12, 2016.
Then those 5 days or so later—and No-
vember 12 was a Sunday—Sunday noon,
early Sunday afternoon, all the highest
ranking Democrats—except Hillary
Clinton, who was still in mourning and
hadn’t gone out in public yet. All the
highest ranking Democrats in the
country found their way to the Man-
darin Hotel here in Washington, D.C.
There, they were to convene a week-
end, or the early part of that week,
planning how they were going to—I am
going to use the word ‘‘utilize’’ and
perhaps ‘‘exploit’’ the Hillary Clinton
presidency that they expected to be a
done deal with the stamp of approval of
the voters on it by that date of Novem-
ber 12, 5 days later, after the election.
But, of course, we all know the real
history of it, and that was that Donald
Trump was elected President instead.
He was President-elect on the morning
after the votes were counted on that
Tuesday in November.
So the Democrats had the Mandarin
Hotel reserved. They descended into
and upon the Mandarin Hotel, Novem-
ber 12, Sunday afternoon, of 2016. They
had to change their agenda. Their
agenda was how to exploit the presi-
dency of Hillary Clinton, and it now be-
came: How are we going to deal with
President Donald Trump?
The political article that first an-
nounces this was published the evening
of November 12, 2016, and the picture in
the center of that is a picture of
George Soros. George Soros, one of
the—I want to say the top funder for
the Democratic Party in the United
States of America, involved in some 60
countries, I believe, undermining the
God-given freedom and liberty that we
are trying to restore, protect, or ad-
vance, wherever it might be. George
Soros was the headliner.
Everybody that was there, except
Hillary Clinton, they changed their
agenda, Mr. Speaker. Their agenda was
to be how to exploit the Hillary presi-
dency, and it became: How do we resist
Donald Trump?
In fact, that word ‘‘resist’’ and the
movement of resistance that was
launched with demonstrations across
the major cities in America, weekend
after weekend, all the way up to, in-
cluding, and beyond the inauguration
of President Trump was a brainchild
that emerged there at the Mandarin
Hotel in Washington, D.C.
Not only the idea of the resistance
movement, Mr. Speaker, but other
ideas on what they were going to do.
By any means necessary, we have an
‘‘insurance policy,’’ as Peter Strzok
wrote, to make sure that Donald
Trump is never President, or if he is
President, that he can’t conduct the
operations of a President. We are going
to tie his hands one way or the other.
So there they sat in the Mandarin
Hotel from November 12 to November
15. They came in on Sunday afternoon,
and Wednesday, noon, they are check-
ing out of the Mandarin Hotel having
had this conference, this seance, about
what they are going to do with Donald
Trump.
One is, they are not going to let him
govern. They are going to resist. The
resistance movement and that lan-
guage flowed from there.
They also, I believe, designed certain
pieces of language that they were going
to weaponize so that they could attack
Trump supporters. The Make America
Great Again, MAGA, people, were
going to be targeted by all kinds of pej-
orative statements and labels. They
understood—they, in the Mandarin
Hotel—that they had worn out that
tired, old term called ‘‘racist,’’ the
most dog-eared, worn-out card in the
lexicon deck of the Democrats. They
were going to continue to use ‘‘racist’’
because it still was effective, even
though it was the most-utilized word
that they had.
I will say, also, that I learned this
from a former Member of Congress,
Tom Tancredo, who made it very clear.
He said, when they start calling you
names, that is when you know you
have won the argument. They can’t
keep up with the debate or they
wouldn’t fall to name-calling.

But ‘‘racism,’’ ‘‘racist’’ was worn out.
They needed some other words to
apply. So they began to generate some
of them in the Mandarin Hotel. From
that day, we started to see increased
use in terms like ‘‘Nazi,’’ ‘‘fascist,’’
‘‘white nationalist,’’ ‘‘white suprema-
cist.’’
Those terms flowed out of the Man-
darin Hotel and were kicked into gear
and utilized across this country
against people who were vulnerable to
those kinds of labels. They knew what
they were doing when they weaponized
those terms.
As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, I
happened to have gotten a little curi-
ous and did a little search through
LexisNexis for the term ‘‘white nation-
alist.’’ I chased it back to the year 2000,
and put the search terms in, and I
asked it how many times the term
‘‘white nationalist’’ was used between
the year 2000 and 2016. It came back
virtually none. To be precise, ‘‘vir-
tually none’’ really means 100 to 200
times a year by all the publications out
there. All the scholarship work that is
being done, all the blogs, all the com-
ments on all the articles written, and
the articles themselves added up to 100
to 200 times a year from 2000 to 2016
that the term ‘‘white nationalist’’ had
been used.
That is virtually none in a great
country like we are, with over 300 mil-
lion people and all the publications
that we have.
My name shows up a lot more than
that, just to give you an example, Mr.
Speaker, and I am not always happy
about that. But virtually not used,
‘‘white nationalists.’’
Then, when you get to 2016, this is
the year at the Mandarin Hotel when
they gathered together and decided
what they are going to do to try to
deny an effective Presidency for Don-
ald Trump and to deny the will of the
people. The LexisNexis search showed
that that virtually never-used term of
‘‘white nationalist’’ jumped up to 10,000
times in 2016. In 2017, Mr. Speaker, it
jumped to 30,000 times. In 2018, it was
still there at 20,000 times.
A word that was virtually unused
now had become weaponized. You can
look at the charts and the graphs on
this, Mr. Speaker, and you will see that
‘‘white supremacy,’’ ‘‘fascist,’’ and
‘‘Nazi’’ all also took jumps. But the
most stark jump is ‘‘white nation-
alist,’’ and that is the term that is
most weaponized. All the rest of these
are weaponized also.
So when you weaponize the term, it
changes the meaning of it, and they
know that. They turn it into a pejo-
rative term. I asked a couple of more
senior Members who have served in
this House of Representatives just last
weekend: What do those terms mean?
They said: They don’t belong in our
language. I never heard that language.
I sat down here this morning with a
gray-haired Member of the House of
Representatives who grew up in a simi-
lar era that I did, from the South, and
he said: We never used those terms. We
don’t know what they mean in common
language.
Well, they were weaponized, and the
definitions that the people wanted
them to have in that Mandarin Hotel
November 12 through 15 of 2016 are the
definitions that have been applied to
those terms, and they are using them
against people.
That is just one thing. But they also
determined that there were going to be
demonstrations across America. These
demonstrations ensued in city after
city, all over the country. They had to
be funded. People didn’t have anything
to be aggrieved about until they were
told that they weren’t going to be
happy with President-elect Trump. So
they began to demonstrate.
It culminated here in this city, June
20, 2017, Mr. Speaker. That is when we
came together to celebrate the inau-
guration of President Donald Trump.
I traveled around this city. I was
here for the inauguration, and I trav-
eled to the events that it was impor-
tant that I attend. Everywhere I went,
the city was jam-packed full of these
ladies in their silly pink hats. I won’t
describe for the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD
what they called them, Mr. Speaker,
but they were everywhere. They had
posters and signs just replete with all
the obscenities that one could imagine.
I believe there were more people here
protesting the inauguration of Donald
Trump than were here celebrating the
Presidency and the inauguration of
Donald Trump. They jammed the
streets. They stood in front of our car,
and they blocked our traffic. They de-
scended upon me in a McDonald’s over
there in a part of town.
I thought I actually ought to have
something to eat that day, and I ended
up with about 200 of them in pink hats
surrounding me. I thought, I will just
debate them down to the last one. I
kept asking them, ‘‘Why are you
here?’’
‘‘We are here to demonstrate for
women’s rights.’’
So I just kept asking them, ‘‘What
rights do men have that women don’t
have?’’
That stumped every one of them.
They didn’t have a single answer to
that question, out of 200 or so that ap-
proached me in that McDonald’s that
day. But I saw what they did in this
city, and I asked them.
They complained they didn’t have
enough money to pay for their health
insurance, the Affordable Care Act.
The un-Affordable Care Act is the more
accurate way to describe it. But they
had been able to buy a plane ticket
from Phoenix to Washington, D.C., and
a couple of hotel rooms so they could
be there to demonstrate in their pink
hats.
Who funded that? It wasn’t out of
their pocket, Mr. Speaker. I would sus-
pect it was out of the pockets of
George Soros and his subordinates. But
that bill is the foundation for what is
going on here. It gets us into this new
year. That was January 20, 2017.
Shortly after Donald Trump was in-
augurated President of the United
States, he had a meeting with James
Comey. James Comey was interviewing
for the job as Director of the FBI.
There was also an interview with Rob-
ert Mueller, who I believe did not tell
the truth, even though he was under
oath. But the record showed that he
was interviewing for the job of Director
of the FBI as well.
James Comey went outside his meet-
ing in the Oval Office with President
Trump, sat down, and typed up from
his memory what he believed was the
exchange between Donald Trump and
James Comey. In short order, he took
it up to Columbia University and hand-
ed it over to a law professor, who was
a friend of his, with either the direct or
the implied, explicit or implied direc-
tions: Leak this information in the pri-
vate meeting with Donald Trump to
The New York Times.
The objective is to upset this country
in such a way that they will have to
name a special counsel to investigate
the Russia collusion that we heard
about for 2 years, and that special
counsel needs to be Robert Mueller.
Well, see how this unfolded? Our At-
torney General Jeff Sessions, who is a
personal friend and someone whose in-
telligence and integrity I admire and
respect, found himself in a place where
he accepted some advice that I think,
to this day, he would tell you he
wished he hadn’t accepted that advice,
but the advice was to recuse himself
from anything that has to do with the
Russian investigation.
Our Attorney General was essentially
unable to address the circumstances of
this Russia investigation. The special
counsel is named—Robert Mueller. The
special counsel is named by Rod Rosen-
stein, the Deputy Attorney General,
the number two in the Department of
Justice, and his position has been fall-
ing under significant question since
that time as well.
But, Mr. Speaker, we ended up with
Robert Mueller. We ended up with
about 17 or so investigators/prosecutors
handpicked. Handpicked by whom? Was
it Robert Mueller? It sure didn’t sound
like it 2 years later when he is under
oath trying to explain the Mueller re-
port before the United States Congress.
It sounded more like he wasn’t in
charge, or if he was in charge, he didn’t
remember what was going on.
That is a good example of why when
you have witnesses to testify, espe-
cially in these times, when the destiny
of America is on the bubble and can
turn, you have to have those witnesses
open in the public where people can
watch them, watch their body lan-
guage, watch their facial expressions,
listen for the pauses before they an-
swer the questions, and listen to the
voice inflection to determine whether
you believe that witness or don’t be-
lieve that witness.
If you just end up with a transcript
that one day we are able to extract
from ADAM SCHIFF, you are not able to

evaluate the demeanor of the wit-
nesses. What you have to do, then, is
you just accept what he has served up.
But the Mueller investigation went
on for nearly 2 years with roughly 17
investigators. At least 13 of them clear-
ly had a history of partisanship, Mr.
Speaker. Some of them were ruthless,
undercutting, partisan prosecutors.
Weissmann would be one of those who
comes to mind for me.
One of the people on that panel was
Peter Strzok, and it looks like Peter
Strzok was the individual who was in
the center of most everything that was
going on and the weaponization of the
Department of Justice and the FBI.
Was he the individual who named all
the folks that were part of the Mueller
team? And when the text with his
lover, Lisa Page, came out, and we saw
the partisan, nasty, bitter, undercut-
ting, on-the-verge-of-treason texts that
came back and forth between Peter
Strzok and his lover, Lisa Page, it be-
came obvious even to Robert Mueller
that he needed to remove Peter Strzok
from the investigative team, the
Mueller team that was seeking to find
something that they could impeach
Donald Trump for. That was Peter
Strzok.
But we went through nearly 2 years
of that, $25 million to $30 million.
When the Mueller report came out,
they asked Robert Mueller to come to
testify before Congress. Throughout all
of that, the Democrats were licking
their chops, Mr. Speaker, as: Surely,
we have this Mueller report. He is such
a smart guy. James Comey handpicked
him, and James Comey despises the
President, and he will move to New
Zealand if Donald Trump is reelected.
b 2100
So, surely, James Comey gave us
good advice that Robert Mueller will
be the man who can pull this informa-
tion out and document the trans-
gressions of Donald Trump so that we
can impeach him and remove him from
office because of that animosity that
exists when a person steps up and tells
the truth and tells America first and
says we are going to restore the respect
for the rule of law and we are going to
restore our border security and we are
going to restore our American
strengths.
All of these points that come for-
ward—America first—all of that was
apparently anathema to the people in
the Department of Justice and the FBI
and other departments—the CIA, for
example.
So we saw, as this unfolded, this
great anticipation that the Mueller re-
port was going to bring forth these
items, multiple items, that would be
just cause to impeach Donald Trump.
And it landed with a big thud because
we had open hearings, and the testi-
mony of Robert Mueller fell flat for a
number of reasons.
Some said that he wasn’t astute
enough to be able to deliver the
Mueller report effectively. That may or
may not be true.
But I will make the argument that
the real reason was lack of substance.
If there had been substance there,
someone on the Democrat side of the
Judiciary Committee—maybe several,
and most likely several—would have
pulled that substance out and brought
that forward so that we would know
what it was in the Mueller report that
they thought should be worthy of im-
peaching the President of the United
States.
Well, if you remember, Mr. Speaker,
when the Mueller report landed and
Robert Mueller testified before the
committee and his testimony came out
to be very empty and vacant and vacu-
ous, there was a silence out of the
Democrats for, oh, a couple of weeks
like: What are we going to do? We are
still determined that there must be
something in the Mueller report that
we can use to impeach the President,
but we don’t know what. We don’t
know what we can make stick with the
American people.
Because, in the end, this judgment on
the impeachment is up to the Amer-
ican people. That is how it transfers
through the system eventually—not
right away, not directly, but eventu-
ally.
Well, they finally figured out, after 2
weeks or 3 weeks or so, that they
weren’t going to be able to utilize the
Mueller report to impeach the Presi-
dent.
So, what do they do? Well, we are
going to have to tool up another kind
of an argument. What shall we use to
get rid of this President? Two years
burned up on the Mueller report, all
the weaponization of the Department
of Justice and the FBI.
I want to make sure, Mr. Speaker,
that people understand. I lived through
Watergate. I watched it closely.
I lived through the impeachment of
Bill Clinton. I watched it closely, even
more closely than Watergate.
But, as far as Bill Clinton’s impeach-
ment was concerned—and he was im-
peached—it wasn’t so much a matter of
corruption within government as it
was the matter of the corruption of the
President himself. Be that as it may, it
threatened our Republic, our constitu-
tional Republic.
But, if I take you back to 1974 and we
talk about the Nixon impending im-
peachment—not the actual, but the im-
pending impeachment—and we think
about what actually took place then
and Watergate, this, I will say, horrible
event within American history that
tore this country apart, what happened
was a few of the campaign operatives
for Nixon’s reelect team broke into Wa-
tergate to see what they could gather
up in information from the Democrats.
That was really stupid, and it was
really against the law, yet it wasn’t
within the knowledge base of President
Nixon that they were about to or had
invaded that space and committed that
burglary. But, when Nixon found out
that they had committed the burglary,
he set about trying to cover it up.
We were involved in the Vietnam war
at the time. We had Vietnamization.
Peace with honor was the message that
President Nixon was involved in. And
we were having success; I would say,
from my memory, significant success.
But President Nixon decided that the
violations of the law that took place in
the Watergate break-in, he made a de-
cision to try to cover it up. Rather
than stepping forward and saying these
people need to be frog-marked into jus-
tice and we are going to clean this up
and it never was anything that was
commanded from on high out of Nix-
on’s office, instead, he set about trying
to cover it up, which was a dramatic
mistake in judgment by the President
of the United States.
Had he been successful and we had
never heard about this, the Vietnam
war may have had an entirely different
result, Mr. Speaker.
So, President Nixon had a number of
things, a number of responsibilities to
weigh when he made that decision to
try to cover it up.
But, nonetheless, we are at this place
in history where we look back in the
rearview mirror and we say that was a
mistake to try to cover it up because
he got caught.
He would have been removed from of-
fice because Republicans had integrity
and Democrats had partisanship and, I
believe, integrity, so they decided that
a President who was that dishonest,
who would go to that level, needed to
be removed from office. That was the
judgment at the time of the people who
were elected here in the House and in
the Senate. And I do not quibble with
those decisions or those positions that
were taken.
That was Richard Nixon, 1974; Bill
Clinton, 1998.
These things that I have talked
about—covering up the crime of a bur-
glary for political-motivated purposes,
covering up the sexual activities by
committing felonies of perjury, ob-
struction of justice, and subornation of
perjury—those truly are at least, if
they are not high crimes, serious mis-
demeanors.
But they came up with nothing in the
Russia investigation with Robert
Mueller, nothing that could stick, even
though they had rigged this game
against the President of the United
States, President Trump, with the dos-
sier.
And who colluded with the Russians
to produce the dossier? The DNC. I
mean, it started out with a check writ-
ten by Paul Singer to do opposition re-
search, because he is a never Trumper.
He got what he could get out of the
dossier effort in the beginning as it got
handed over through Fusion GPS, fund-
ed by the DNC, and checks written
through the attorney’s office in order
to try to defuse the trail, following the
money trail on how this was put to-
gether.
But we know the dossier was
unverified and it was full of manufac-
tured narratives, much of it plugged in

there by the Russians to upset the elec-
tion results of the United States. And,
if you look at their efforts, yes, they
did try to affect the results of the elec-
tion here in the United States. I be-
lieve that is true. But I don’t know
that they had a choice on who they
wanted to be President of the United
States so much as they just wanted to
create chaos within our system.
So they spent something like $100,000
on internet ads. That is a piece of it.
They did other things to try to hack
into messages going out. There is no
evidence that they affected any vote
tally. There is always a speculation
that, perhaps, they did affect the way
some people voted.
But we also know that there were, I
will say, I am going to say, hundreds of
millions of dollars—it runs into the bil-
lions—spent on advertisement in this
country to also affect the election.
So, I recall sitting there with a group
of Russians at a conference that we
had, and, after having excoriated them
for their effort to upset our elections
here, their response was: So 13 of our
Russian hackers were in a building in
Russia and they created this much
chaos in the United States of America
for $100,000 worth of ads and 13 of them
working in there trying to be hackers.
Think how bad it would have been for
you all if there had been 26.
That was their answer to me.
Mr. Speaker, I reflect on that, and I
have to give them a little nod, kind of
a little silent smile of he had enough
audacity to make the statement. What
it amounts to, really, is it says that 13
Russians didn’t affect the election here
in the United States.
What they did was wrong. They have
been indicted by the Mueller people.
We will never see them again. They are
never going to be brought to justice.
Thirteen Russians, and we were all tied
in knots for 2 years, $25 million to
maybe as high as $30 million of the
Muller report that comes back to be
nothing.
So what is the next play? It is kind of
like you call a big play in a football
game and you drop back to throw this
pass and you get sacked for a 25- or 30-
yard loss. You go back to the huddle.
What are you going to do now? Well,
we are not going to run a dive play
that is going to get 3 yards. We are
going to have to come up with another
trick play.
Well, what is that going to be? Let’s
see. We are going to get the President
for a phone call to Ukraine.
And we know the story on that. It is
contemporary, Mr. Speaker. I don’t
have to refresh the body on this very
much except that, when you read the
transcript of that phone call, that
transcript that has been vetted by at
least six different people who are pro-
fessionals to make sure that the con-
text of that call and the language of
that call is reflected within the tran-
script that they type up for that call, I
read it with this peace, or I thought: I
am going to get to a place where I get
this little peace in my gut that kind of
flips and says, ‘‘Oh, he actually said
that?’’ And I read it with that in mind,
carefully.
I found no place that troubled me in
any way whatsoever. When the Presi-
dent said—and I have heard him in his
own voice and person say this—it was a
perfect phone call, he has got a strong
argument. It is pretty close to a per-
fect phone call; although, I don’t think
much of anything is ever perfect in this
society.
And the request to go in and do the
investigation of Burisma and any board
member, as I looked at that request
that was there, this country has been
full of questions about what was going
on in Ukraine. And if Joe Biden’s son is
on the board for $50,000 a month with
no energy expertise whatsoever, isn’t
that worth looking into?
And we also have the videotape of
then-Vice President Joe Biden saying:
Yeah, I held a billion-dollar check out
and dangled it in front of the Ukrain-
ians, and I told them that, ‘‘If you
don’t fire that prosecutor that is inves-
tigating the oil company whose board
my son is on, if you don’t fire him, I
am leaving in 6 hours with the check,
and I am not coming back.’’ And he
said—and I can’t say these words here
on the floor, but it was son of a blank.
They fired him, within a very short pe-
riod of time.
That leveraged the investigator out
who was on the trail, at least he be-
lieved, of corruption in Ukraine, and
that corruption pulled into question at
least Hunter Biden, if not Joe Biden
himself.
So, why was Joe Biden so determined
to extort the firing of the investigator
in Ukraine by dangling a billion-dollar
check in front of him—which was a
loan guaranty, to make the record cor-
rect. Why was Joe Biden doing that,
and why is it moral for Joe Biden to
enforce a shutdown of an investigation
that would be cleaning up corruption
in Ukraine before U.S. dollars would be
put into that system?
He is enhancing corruption. He is not
cleaning up corruption. And Donald
Trump’s statement, if it is to be read
at all, was an encouragement to go in
and do the investigation to clean up
the corruption, not to enhance the cor-
ruption.
A billion-dollar equivalent of a bribe
by Joe Biden—I will give you this bil-
lion-dollar loan guaranty if you fire
the investigator that is investigating
the corruption—versus Donald Trump
implying, but not saying: Can you help
us out here? Can you help us with the
investigation? Can you reopen this in-
vestigation into Burisma, because I am
hearing a lot of problems over here in
the United States about what has been
going on in Ukraine.
Now, is it happenstance that Joe
Biden is a potential political rival? He
is not a political rival right now, Mr.
Speaker. He is a candidate in a Demo-
cratic primary for President of the
United States that started out with, I
don’t know, 24 or so Democrats alto-
gether.
And he may still be the marginal
frontrunner, although I think ELIZA-
BETH WARREN—I am confident she has
passed him up in Iowa, and it looks
like the momentum of his campaign
has flattened out. But why would
President Trump be so concerned about
this that he would ask that they would
go in to do this investigation?
And I will say, instead, a President of
the United States has a duty to inves-
tigate for corruption, and he has an ob-
ligation by law not to advance those
funds until there are assurances that
corruption is cleaned up.
That is a statute that has been
served up to him, and it exists out
there. And I have read the language. I
just don’t have it in front of me to
quote it to you exactly here tonight,
Mr. Speaker.
So President Trump, I believe, was
following not only his conscience and
good judgment and leadership, but fol-
lowing the law that compelled him to
ensure that corruption was being
cleaned up in Ukraine before U.S. aid
could go into Ukraine.
b 2115
And they found a way to turn this
around and say, well, no, we are going
to assign the President a motive, and
then we are going make the motive
stick, and that motive will be—they
will rise to the level that we are going
to impeach him in the United States
House of Representatives for seeking to
use U.S. dollars as an incentive for an
investigation into his political oppo-
nent. How about an investigation into
corruption?
The corruption was being inves-
tigated until Joe Biden stepped in and
extorted the firing of the investigator
in Ukraine. And all Donald Trump said
was, can you light this back up again,
and let’s find out what the truth is.
Why is anybody on the other side of
the aisle, Joe Biden or Hunter Biden or
anyone else included, why are they
worried about an investigation if they
are clean? The investigation must be
shut down by Democrats for some rea-
son. I mean, from where I stand, I am
clean. And so, if somebody says I am
going to investigate STEVE KING, I say,
fine, go ahead. You know, if that is all
you have to do with your life, go ahead.
They said the other day what hap-
pens if they bring ethics charges
against those of us who went down to
the SCIF and said we are going to bring
sunlight into this basement room here
that ADAM SCHIFF is holding his secret
impeachment hearings in, and some of
the Members said, well, gee, it is going
to cost us millions of dollars to defend
ourselves if they bring ethics charges
against us. And I said, it is not going to
cost me a dime. Lock me up if that is
the case, because we have a Constitu-
tion to protect and preserve. We have a
country to protect and preserve. We
have a legacy that is handed to us from
our Founding Fathers that requires us

to step up and defend our Constitution
and the rule of law and the principles
of truth, justice, and the American
way, no matter how heavy the partisan
politics get. And they are heavy. They
are so heavy that the history of im-
peachment is kicked aside by ADAM
SCHIFF and NANCY PELOSI.
And I picked up the impeachment
resolutions from 1974, Resolution of In-
quiry. ‘‘Following is the text of House
Resolution 803, as approved by the
House February 6, 1974.’’ This is the
Nixon impeachment resolution.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD
the 1974 resolution for the impeach-
ment of Richard Nixon.
1974 RESOLUTION OF INQUIRY
Following is the text of House Resolution
803, as approved by the House Feb. 6, 1974:
Resolved, That the Committee on the Judi-
ciary, acting as a whole or by any sub-
committee thereof appointed by the chair-
man for the purposes hereof and in accord-
ance with the rules of the committee, is au-
thorized and directed to investigate fully and
completely whether sufficient grounds exist
for the House of Representatives to exercise
its constitutional power to impeach Richard
M. Nixon, President of the United States of
America. The committee shall report to the
House of Representatives such resolutions,
articles of impeachment, or other rec-
ommendations as it deems proper.
Sec. 2:

by counsel for the committee); and
(B) the production of such things; and
(2) by interrogatory, the furnishing of such
information; as it deems necessary to such
investigation.
(b) Such authority of the committee may
be exercised—
(1) by the chairman and the ranking mi-
nority member acting jointly, or, if either
declines to act, by the other acting alone, ex-

ther of them (or, with respect to any deposi-
tion, answer to interrogatory, or affidavit,
any person authorized by law to administer
oaths) may administer oaths to any witness.
For the purpose of this section, ‘‘things’’ in-
cludes, without limitation, books, records,
correspondence, logs, journals, memoran-

Sec. 3. For the purpose of making such in-

Sec. 4. Any funds made available to the
Committee on the Judiciary under House
Resolution 702 of the Ninety-third Congress,
adopted November 15, 1973, or made available
for the purpose hereafter, may be expended
for the purpose of carrying out the investiga-
tion authorized and directed by this resolu-
tion.
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD the October 7, 1998,
resolution for the impeachment of Bill
Clinton.
Resolved, That the Committee on the Judi-
ciary, acting as a whole or by any sub-
committee thereof appointed by the chair-
man for the purposes hereof and in accord-
ance with the rules of the committee, is au-
thorized and directed to investigate fully and
completely whether sufficient grounds exist
for the House of Representatives to exercise
its constitutional power to impeach William
Jefferson Clinton, President of the United
States of America. The committee shall re-
port to the House of Representatives such
resolutions, articles of impeachment, or
other recommendations as it deems proper.
Sec. 2. (a) For the purpose of making such
investigation, the committee is authorized
to require—
( 1) by subpoena or otherwise—
(A) the attendance and testimony of any
person (including at a taking of a deposition
by counsel for the committee); and
(B) the production of such things; and
(2) by interrogatory, the furnishing of such
information; as it deems necessary to such
investigation.
(b) Such authority of the committee may
be exercised—
(1) by the chairman and the ranking mi-
nority member acting jointly, or, if either
declines to act, by the other acting alone, ex-
cept that in the event either so declines, ei-
ther shall have the right to refer to the com-
mittee for decision the question whether
such authority shall be so exercised and the
committee shall be convened promptly to
render that decision; or
(2) by the committee acting as a whole or
by subcommittee,
Subpoenas and interrogatories so author-
ized may be issued over the signature of the
chairman, or ranking minority member, or
any member designated by either of them,
and may be served by any person designated
by the chairman, or ranking minority mem-
ber, or any member designated by either of
them. The chairman, or ranking minority
member, or any member designated by ei-
ther of them ( or, with respect to any deposi-
tion, answer to interrogatory, or affidavit,
any person authorized by law to administer
oaths) may administer oaths to any witness.
For the purposes of this section, ‘‘things’’ in-
cludes, without limitation, books, records,
correspondence, logs, journals, memoran-
dums, papers, documents, writings, draw-
ings, graphs, charts, photographs, reproduc-
tions, recordings, tapes, transcripts, print-
outs, data compilations from which informa-
tion can be obtained (translated if necessary,
through detection devices into reasonably
usable form), tangible objects, and other
things of any kind.
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, when
you lay them down side-by-side and
you read them, they come out and say,
‘‘Authorizing and directing the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary to investigate
whether sufficient grounds exist for the
impeachment of William Jefferson
Clinton, President of the United
States.’’ The committee—this says,
‘‘Resolved, that the Committee on the
Judiciary’’—this is Nixon—‘‘acting as a
whole or by any subcommittee thereof
appointed by the chairman for the pur-
poses hereof and in accordance with
the rules of the committee, is author-
ized and directed to investigate fully
and completely whether sufficient
grounds exist for the House of Rep-
resentatives to exercise its constitu-
tional power to impeach Richard M.
Nixon, President of the United States
of America. The committee shall re-
port to the House of Representatives
such resolutions, Articles of Impeach-
ment, and other recommendations as it
deems proper.’’
This is substantively the same. The
provisions in here, the language varies
a little bit in the preambles, but the
provisions in here are identical, be-
cause they had an understanding that
they needed to be in conformance with
the constitution, Mr. Speaker, with
history, with the sense of fairness and
trust and knowing that antiquity
would look back on this and see how
did they conduct themselves in the
House of Representatives when they
were faced with this question of wheth-
er or not to impeach a President of the
United States.
Well, I have this other resolution
here, Mr. Speaker. This is H. Res—it’s
before the Rules Committee tonight, it
doesn’t have a number on it now as I
have it, it is not at all like the resolu-
tions, the identical resolutions of Rich-
ard Nixon and Bill Clinton.
And it is also curious that in modern
times we have gone back to this im-
peachment over and over again where
the only other impeachment up until
Richard Nixon was Andrew Johnson
shortly after the Civil War.
But here is what we have. This is I
think the ADAM SCHIFF resolution. It
says: ‘‘The chair . . . shall designate an
open hearing or hearings pursuant to
this section.’’
Well great, we went down to the
SCIF and shined sunlight on that, and
now they have capitulated to the pres-
sure that was brought to bear that day,
and they are going to have an open
hearing or hearings.
Well, I wrote a little note on there
that says, yes, they are going to have
an open hearing, one. It is a minimum
of one. They might have more if they
decide to, but not all. They are still de-
termined. This resolution says that
they can go back down into the base-
ment room of the Capitol, the secret
room and conduct their secret hearings
with their secret rules and the public
can’t see in, the public can’t hear the
audio, the public can’t see the video,
the public nor other Members of Con-
gress can watch the facial expressions,
listen to the voice inflections, watch
the body language and determine the
demeanor and veracity of the wit-
nesses. That is not going to happen

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8675
October 30, 2019
under this resolution that comes to us
tomorrow just as they are going to do
one open hearing. And it might be a
gavel in and gavel out. That will com-
ply with this resolution. And they can
move on.
It says also, The chair and ranking
minority member of the committee—
that is the secret committee, the Per-
manent Select Committee—‘‘shall be
permitted to question witnesses for
equal specified periods of longer than 5
minutes, as determined by the chair.’’
So ADAM SCHIFF can decide if he
wants to question a witness for beyond
5 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30
minutes, even 45 minutes because they
have a 90-minute cap on this, as deter-
mined by the chair. But if ADAM SCHIFF
wants to question a witness for 6 min-
utes only, that means that DEVIN
NUNES can only question that witness
for 6 minutes only. Well, that is a pret-
ty tight rule, isn’t it?
So if they like what the witness is
saying, they are going to continue to
ask questions. If they don’t like what
he is saying, he is going to shut that
questioning off, and that shuts off
DEVIN NUNES, and he is the only one
that can ask questions of that witness.
It says but the time, ‘‘shall be equal
for the chair and the ranking minority
member.’’ Sure. But the chair deter-
mines how long that time will be.
And then it says it, ‘‘shall not exceed
90 minutes,’’ which I mentioned ‘‘in the
aggregate. Only the chair and ranking
member or a Permanent Select Com-
mittee employee,’’ meaning staff, ‘‘if
yielded to by the chair or ranking mi-
nority member may question witnesses
during such periods of questioning.’’
So the rest of the committee that is
allowed access into that secret base-
ment room, there in the dark, in the
confines of the most secret room in the
entire Capitol complex, they are con-
structing a method to try to impeach
the President of the United States.
Banana republics do that. Soviet-
style justice does that. It is not justice
in the Soviet, it is not justice here.
Also it says, ‘‘At the conclusion of
questioning pursuant to this para-
graph, the committee shall proceed
with questioning under the 5-minute
rule pursuant to clause. . . . ’’ Does
that allow all Members? That is not de-
termined.
‘‘ . . . minority witness requests, the
ranking minority member may submit
to the chair, in writing, any requests
for witness testimony . . . ’’ But ‘‘any
such request shall be accompanied by a
detailed written justification of the
relevance of the testimony of each re-
quested witness to the investigation
described in the first section of the res-
olution.’’ Then it says, ‘‘The ranking
minority member of the Permanent Se-
lect Committee is authorized, with the
concurrence of the chair, to require, as
deemed necessary to the investigation
. . . subpoena. . . . ’’
Let me boil this down for you, Mr.
Speaker. What it really says is, the
chair has subpoena power, and the
ranking member has subpoena power, if
the chair allows the ranking member
to have subpoena power, which means
the majority runs this whole show. The
ranking member, the minority, if he
does not like it that he is denied sub-
poena power, oh, he is free to appeal it
to the full committee. The full com-
mittee, which is dominated by Demo-
crats and commanded by ADAM SCHIFF
and will never—and I will put this
point down—will never roll their
speaker on a question of a subpoena for
a witness that might defend the Presi-
dent of the United States, as called by
the ranking member, DEVIN NUNES.
That is what we are dealing with.
‘‘In the case that the chair declines
to concur in a proposed action of the
ranking minority member . . . the
ranking minority member shall have
the right to refer to the committee for
decision. . . .’’ That is just what I said.
He can go to the committee, but the
votes aren’t going to be there in an ob-
jective fashion. The votes are only
going to be those that follow down the
partisan line. That is what it is set up
to do.
It says, ‘‘The chair is authorized to
make publicly available . . . the tran-
scripts of depositions.’’ And they may
be ‘‘with appropriate redactions for
classified and other sensitive informa-
tion.’’ Other sensitive information
means whatever ADAM SCHIFF decides
the public shouldn’t know if it runs
contrary to his agenda will be redacted
before any report comes out of there.
And remember, we are not going to see
the video, we are not going to hear the
audio, we are not going to read the
transcript. We are going to get the
edited version that ADAM SCHIFF would
deliver to us.
It says, ‘‘The Permanent Select Com-
mittee is directed to issue a report set-
ting forth its findings and rec-
ommendations. . . . The chair shall
transmit such report . . . to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary. . . .’’ Well, so
the report would go to the Judiciary
Committee. The Judiciary Committee
then would have the responsibility pre-
sumably of taking up an impeachment
motion and debating it up or down and
voting on it in the Judiciary Com-
mittee. It takes a lot of authority out
of the hands of JERRY NADLER, the
chair of the committee. And it says to
me that the Speaker and ADAM SCHIFF
and others in leadership over on this
side of the aisle don’t have the con-
fidence that JERRY NADLER will handle
this the way they would like to see him
handle it.
‘‘The report required by this para-
graph shall be prepared in consultation
with the chairs of the Committee on
Foreign Affairs and the Committee on
Oversight and Reform.’’ Prepared with
their counsel with the chairs. Seems
like they left out the ranking mem-
bers. There will be no minority input
in this. They are just going to sit down
with the chairs of some other commit-
tees that they claim to be relevant and
have them weigh in on this before this
report comes out, Mr. Speaker.
‘‘The chair of the Permanent Select
Committee . . . in consultation with
the ranking minority member, to
transfer such records or materials to
the Committee on the Judiciary.’’ The
chair in consultation. What does ‘‘con-
sultation’’ mean? That means ADAM
SCHIFF can say, hey, DEVIN NUNES, I
am going to introduce this report and
send it over to the Judiciary Com-
mittee. What do you think? And rank-
ing member NUNES can say, ‘‘I don’t
like it. I think it is dishonest.’’ Well,
too bad, we consulted, now I am send-
ing it to judiciary. That is all this lan-
guage requires. This is a phony resolu-
tion, Mr. Speaker.
‘‘Committee on the Judiciary.’’ It
says, ‘‘The House authorizes the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary to conduct
proceedings relating to the impeach-
ment inquiry . . . including such proce-
dures as to allow for the participation
of the President and his counsel.’’ Oh,
that is good. I would be happy to have
the President’s counsel there, but it
doesn’t say the judiciary, it says, au-
thorizes the committee to conduct
those proceedings. It doesn’t say shall
allow the President’s counsel. So that
is all missing.
‘‘ . . . Judiciary is authorized to pro-
mulgate additional procedures as it
deems necessary. . . .’’ Well, that will
be the majority deeming necessary
that which they think will best im-
peach the President, not an impartial
hearing.
In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I want to
see a balanced and a fair process, one
that is consistent with the history of
the United States of America.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

REPORTS OF COMMITTEES ON

committees were delivered to the Clerk

PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray. Eternal master, You sit
on the throne of the Universe. We offer
You today a sacrifice of Thanksgiving,
for we borrow our heartbeats from You.
Inspire our lawmakers to love dis-
cipline and to cherish Your word, seek-
ing always to glorify You. May they
trust Your power and wisdom to supply
what is needed to keep our Nation

We pray in Your merciful Name.

WOMEN’S SMALL BUSINESS
MONTH
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, be-
fore I read, I want to apologize to the
Small Business Women of America be-
cause October is National Women’s
Small Business Month, and my apolo-
gies because this speech should have
been given on October 1 rather than at
the end of the month.
October is National Women’s Small
Business Month, and I want to recog-
nize the many women-owned busi-
nesses. They really help make our
economy stronger. In Iowa, we work
hard to inspire women to start busi-
nesses and support them in their entre-
preneurial journeys.
According to American Express, Iowa
ranks eighth out of 50 States for
growth in the number of women-owned
businesses, as well as in their own
growth in employment and revenues.
The network growth for women en-
trepreneurs and access to resources
have helped make the difference in
these women’s lives and our commu-
nities. I hope that this growth will con-
tinue and that we will continue to have
a massive increase in the number of
women’s small businesses in America.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to speak for 1 further minute as in
morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.

IMPEACHMENT
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I
know you aren’t going to believe this—
what happened in addition to President
Trump being sworn in—but on January
20, 2017, President Trump was sworn
into office and became our Nation’s
45th President. Most Presidents enjoy
what political scientists refer to as a
‘‘honeymoon’’ period. During that hon-
eymoon period, these new Presidents
are given a chance to push their agen-
da, and partisan politics usually takes
a back seat—but not for this President.
On his Inauguration Day, January 20,
2017, a Washington Post headline
read—so it had to be coming out even
before he was sworn in—‘‘The cam-
paign to impeach President Trump has
begun.’’ That campaign has been in full
swing ever since. Let’s make no mis-
take: This process about concerns over
alleged high crimes and misdemeanors,
as the Constitution speaks about the
reasons for impeachment, doesn’t real-
ly mean much compared to an effort to
impeach this President that started be-
fore he ever was sworn in. No, instead,
this is about the Democratic Party,
still bitter years later, trying to undo
the 2016 election.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD
that article in the Washington Post,
dated January 20, 2017.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
[From the Washington Post, Jan. 20, 2017]
THE CAMPAIGN TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT TRUMP
HAS BEGUN
(By Matea Gold)
The effort to impeach President Donald
John Trump is already underway.
At the moment the new commander in
chief was sworn in, a campaign to build pub-
lic support for his impeachment went live at
ImpeachDonaldTrumpNow.org, spearheaded
by two liberal advocacy groups aiming to lay
the groundwork for his eventual ejection
from the White House.
The organizers behind the campaign, Free
Speech for People and RootsAction, are hing-
ing their case on Trump’s insistence on
maintaining ownership of his luxury hotel
and golf course business while in office. Eth-
ics experts have warned that his financial
holdings could potentially lead to constitu-
tional violations and undermine public faith
in his decision-making.
Their effort is early, strategists admit. But
they insist it is not premature—even if it
triggers an angry backlash from those who
will argue that they are not giving the new
president a chance.
‘‘If we were to wait for all the ill effects
that could come from this, too much damage
to our democracy would occur,’’ said Ron
Fein, legal director at Free Speech for Peo-
ple. ‘‘It will undermine faith in basic institu-
tions. If nothing else, it’s important for
Americans to trust that the president is
doing what he thinks is the right thing . . .
not that it would help jump-start a stalled
casino project in another country.’’
The impeachment drive comes as Demo-
crats and liberal activists are mounting
broad opposition to stymie Trump’s agenda.
Among the groups organizing challenges to
the Trump administration is the American

Civil Liberties Union, which plans to wield
public-records requests and lawsuits as part
of an aggressive action plan aimed at pro-
tecting immigrants and pushing for govern-
ment transparency, among other issues.
‘‘We think that President Trump will be in
violation of the Constitution and federal
statutes on day one, and we plan a vigorous
offense to ensure the worst of the constitu-
tional violations do not occur,’’ said An-
thony D. Romero, the ACLU’s executive di-
rector.
‘‘We may have a new president, but we
have the same old system of checks and bal-
ances,’’ he added.
Strategists behind the campaign for im-
peachment said they are confident that
other groups will soon join their cause. They
argue that Trump will immediately be in
violation of the U.S. Constitution’s Foreign
Emoluments Clause, which prohibits a presi-
dent from accepting a gift or benefit from a
foreign leader or government.
Fein cited several examples, including rent
paid by the Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China for its space in Trump Tower in New
York and potential ongoing spending by for-
eign diplomats at the Trump International
Hotel in Washington and other Trump prop-
erties. In addition, he said, royalties col-
lected by the Trump organization from the
president’s business partner in the Phil-
ippines, who was recently named special
envoy to the United States, could violate the
clause.
Trump said this month that he would do-
nate ‘‘profits’’ from foreign business clients
to the U.S. Treasury. However, neither
Trump nor representatives of the Trump Or-
ganization have provided details on how such
payments would be tracked, collected and
disbursed.
The foreign emoluments clause has never
been tested in the courts, and some scholars
argue that violating it would not qualify as
‘‘treason, bribery or other high crimes and
misdemeanors,’’ the grounds for impeach-
ment of a federal official.
But Fein noted that former Virginia gov-
ernor Edmund Jennings Randolph, a delegate
to the Constitutional Convention and later
the first U.S. attorney general, argued dur-
ing Virginia’s debate over ratifying the con-
stitution that a president who was found to
have taken a foreign emolument ‘‘may be
impeached.’’
His group has mapped out a long-shot po-
litical strategy to build support for a vote in
the House on articles of impeachment.
The first step is fairly simple: getting a
resolution introduced that calls for the
House Judiciary Committee to investigate
whether there are grounds to impeach
Trump—a move that Fein said a number of
members of Congress are interested in tak-
ing. ‘‘Getting it introduced is not going to be
a problem,’’ he said.
Still, the idea that a majority of the GOP-
controlled House members would ultimately
vote to launch an investigation of the new
president seems highly improbable. Fein said
he is confident the political climate will
change and lawmakers will eventually sup-
port the effort.
‘‘I think that at a certain point, the com-
bination of new revelations coming out and,
importantly, calls and pressure from con-
stituents in their own districts will be a de-
ciding factor,’’ he said. ‘‘And at some point,
they will decide it is in their own interests
to support this.’’
While half a dozen federal judges in Amer-
ican history have been impeached by the
House and successfully convicted in the Sen-
ate, no U.S. president has ever been removed
from office through such a process. The clos-
est was Andrew Johnson, who narrowly
avoided conviction in the Senate in 1868 after
the House charged him with removing the
secretary of war in violation of the Tenure of
Office Act.
In 1974, the House Judiciary Committee ap-
proved articles of impeachment against
then-President Richard Nixon, but he re-
signed before they could be voted on by the
full House. President Bill Clinton was im-
peached by the House on charges of perjury
and obstruction of justice, but the articles of
impeachment were defeated in the Senate in
1999.
Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.

LEADER

f
APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, to-
morrow the Senate will vote on fund-
ing for the national defense. It will
offer a test for our Democratic col-
leagues: Will their party’s impeach-
ment obsession crowd out even the
most basic governing responsibilities?
Unfortunately, it seems we may al-
ready have our answer. The Demo-
cratic leader said at a press conference
yesterday that his party intends to fili-
buster funding for our Armed Forces.
Democrats have plenty of time and en-
ergy for their 3-year-old journey to im-
peach the President, but they can’t get
to yes on funding our servicemembers.
That is about as clear a statement of
priorities as you could get around here.
Just a few days ago, U.S. Special
Forces executed a daring mission and
took out the founder of ISIS. It was the
clearest possible reminder that the na-
tional security of the United States
and the missions of our servicemem-
bers do not pause for partisan politics.
But less than a week later, for political
purposes, Senate Democrats say that
they will refuse to secure funding for
those very same missions.
Washington Democrats have talked
up a storm in recent days, criticizing
the administration’s approach to Syria
and the Middle East. Lots of talk—but,
apparently, they are not concerned
enough about the Middle East and
fighting ISIS to actually vote for the
funding that keeps the missions going.
Consider this. If Democrats filibuster
this defense funding, as they threat-
ened to, they will literally be filibus-
tering the exact kind of military as-
sistance for Ukraine over which they
are trying to impeach the President.
Let me say that again. This legisla-
tion is what appropriates the money
for the Ukraine Security Assistance
Initiative, which is precisely the pro-
gram that Democrats are trying to im-
peach President Trump for supposedly
slow-walking. Yet, tomorrow, right
here in the Senate, they say that they
are going to filibuster funding for the
exact same program.
Only in Washington—only in Wash-
ington will you see a show like that.
They want to impeach the President
for delaying assistance to Ukraine
while they block funding for the pro-
gram themselves. I would say it is un-
believable, except that is exactly what
is happening.
Look, I think it is pretty clear that
our Democratic colleagues do not have
a great affinity for President Trump.
But the country cannot afford for
Democrats in Congress to take a 1-year
vacation from any productive legisla-
tion just because they would rather ob-
sess over impeachment.
ISIS and other radical terrorists are
not going to hit the pause button be-
cause Democrats will not fund the U.S.
military. Strategic competitors like
Russia and China are not going to hit
pause because Democrats would rather
hurt the White House than fund our
military commanders.
Look, Congress needs to do its work.
We need to fund our Armed Forces. To-
morrow’s vote will tell us which Sen-
ators are actually ready to do it.
f
IMPEACHMENT
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President,
speaking of impeachment, yesterday,
House Democrats released their much-
hyped resolution, which was advertised
as bringing fairness and due process
into Speaker PELOSI’s and Chairman
SCHIFF’s closed-door, partisan inquiry.
Unfortunately, the draft resolution
that has been released does nothing of
the sort. It falls way short—way short.
As I have said repeatedly, an im-
peachment inquiry is about the most
solemn and serious process the House
of Representatives can embark upon. It
seeks to effectively nullify Democratic
elections and cancel out the American
people’s choice of a Commander in
Chief.
For that reason, any such inquiry
must be conducted by the highest
standards of fairness and due process.
But thus far, this time around, instead
of setting a high bar, House Democrats
seem determined to set a new low.
Speaker PELOSI has initiated a bi-
zarre process, starting with the fact
that she began it with a press con-
ference instead of a proper vote of the
House. The process seems to be treat-
ing Chairman SCHIFF as though he were
a de facto special prosecutor, notwith-
standing the fact that he is a partisan
Member of Congress whose strange be-
havior has already included fabricating
a lengthy quotation and attributing it
to President Trump during an official
hearing, which he was chairing.
House Democrats’ inquiry thus far
has been conducted behind closed
doors. They have denied their Repub-
lican counterparts privileges that
Democrats received during the Clinton
impeachment when they were in the
minority. Unlike during the inquiries
around both President Clinton and
President Nixon, they have denied
President Trump basic due process
rights and are cutting his counsel out
of the process in an unprecedented
way.
House Democrats’ new resolution
does not change any of that. It does not

confer on President Trump the most
basic rights of due process or, seem-
ingly, alter Chairman SCHIFF’s unfair
process in the House Intelligence Com-
mittee in any way whatsoever.
Chairman SCHIFF can continue doing
this behind closed doors without the
President’s participation, so long as he
holds at least one public hearing at
some point. He is not even required to
make all the evidence he obtains pub-
lic. He alone gets to decide what evi-
dence goes in his report. And the reso-
lution doesn’t even give the President
any rights in the public hearing that it
requires Chairman SCHIFF to hold.
The resolution merely seems to con-
template that maybe—maybe—some-
day in the future, at some other phase
of this, due process might—might—fi-
nally kick in, but only if the House Ju-
diciary Committee feels like holding
hearings and calling its own wit-
nesses—in other words, no due process
now, maybe some later, but only if we
feel like it.
‘‘No due process now, maybe some
later, but only if we feel like it’’ is not
even close to fair. ‘‘No due process now,
maybe some later, but only if we feel
like it’’ is not a standard that should
ever be applied to any American, and it
should not be applied here to the Presi-
dent of the United States.
I understand that many House Demo-
crats made up their minds on impeach-
ment years ago, but our basic norms of
justice do not evaporate just because
Washington Democrats have already
made up their minds.

HEALTHCARE
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on
one final matter, our Democratic col-
leagues do apparently have time to
push for show votes on messaging reso-
lutions with no chance of becoming
law. This week’s installment is a
Democratic effort to limit the flexi-
bility that Governors of both parties
have utilized to lighten the burdens of
ObamaCare. States have jumped at the
opportunity to use waivers to reduce
the costs associated with ObamaCare’s
mandate. In the States that have taken
advantage, premiums decreased signifi-
cantly.
In 2018, the Trump administration ex-
panded this policy with an even more
flexible interpretation of this part of
ObamaCare. The goal was to give
States even more of what they had
been asking for, even more latitude to
preserve consumer choice and lower
premiums. But notwithstanding all the
evidence that says this is the right di-
rection for the American people, our
Democratic colleagues want to roll
back the Trump administration guid-
ance and limit States’ flexibility.
Since this position is virtually im-
possible to explain on its merits, our
Democratic colleagues have instead
turned to a familiar talking point: the
false claim that Republicans are trying
to undercut protections for Americans
with preexisting conditions. Sound fa-
miliar? But, of course, that is not true.
As Senate Republicans have said over
and over and over again, we support
protections for Americans with pre-
existing conditions. And the adminis-
tration has made it very clear that this
waiver program poses no threat—no
threat—to those protections. The Ad-
ministrator of the Centers for Medicare
& Medicaid Services has stated that ‘‘a
section 1332 waiver cannot’’—cannot—
‘‘undermine coverage with people with
pre-existing conditions.’’
What is more, as the White House has
already made clear, Democrats’ resolu-
tion has zero chance of becoming law.
This is just another political mes-
saging exercise with no path to making
an impact.
I urge my colleagues to reject this
resolution, keep fighting to lower pre-
miums for the American people, and
protect those with preexisting condi-
tions.

APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, even
as we consider the package of appro-
priations on the floor this week, we
must also think about how both parties
can reach an agreement on all 12 bills
we need to pass before Thanksgiving. It
is way past time for Democratic and
Republican appropriators to sit down
and hammer out bipartisan agreement
on allocations to the various agencies,
known as 302(b)s. That is how we got
this done in the past. Democrats and
Republicans in Congress have success-
fully negotiated two budget deals. The
key to those agreements was that the
President allowed Congress to do its
work and stayed off to the side. I be-
lieve that, again, if left to our own de-
vices, Congress could work out an
agreement to fund the government.
As everyone remembers, the Presi-
dent’s meddling and erratic behavior
caused the last government shutdown—
the longest in our Nation’s history.
The best way to avoid another shut-
down would be for the President to
keep out of the appropriations process
and for Republicans to stop the games
and get serious about negotiating in a
bipartisan way forward.
I believe there was a meeting yester-
day, and there may be some progress. I
think some progress was made. Let’s
continue moving in that direction, the
four corners of the Appropriations
Committee—House and Senate, Demo-
crats and Republicans—and put to-
gether an agreement we can all sup-
port.
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
Mr. President, on the whistleblower,
as the House of Representatives con-
tinues its impeachment inquiry as to
whether the President jeopardized na-
tional security by pressuring Ukraine
to interfere with our 2020 locations, the
White House, their allies in Congress,
and the media have resorted to des-
picable tactics to falsely discredit indi-
viduals who have provided the House
testimony.
Yesterday, LTC Alexander Vindman,
an Active-Duty Army officer serving
on a detail in the White House, testi-
fied before Congress. Since Lieutenant
Colonel Vindman’s testimony was an-
nounced and especially in the past 24

hours, he has been vilified by individ-
uals in the media and elsewhere. Al-
though he has served our country for
more than 20 years, although he is a re-
cipient of the Purple Heart after being
wounded while serving in Iraq, he has
been called derogatory terms, and some
have even gone so far as to call him a
spy and question his loyalty to the
United States.
These attacks are outrageous. They
are unacceptable, and they are not un-
like the attacks the President and his
allies have levied against the whistle-
blower whose account first alerted Con-
gress to the President’s misconduct
with Ukraine. The President has pub-
licly suggested the whistleblower is
treasonous and a spy.
Separately, recent public reports sug-
gest that a Republican member of the
House Intelligence Committee is ac-
tively trying to expose and leak the
whistleblower’s identity. This is so, so
wrong. Disclosing or causing to be dis-
closed the identity of a whistleblower
is such a breach of faith of our whistle-
blower laws, which are designed to see
that the truth gets out. Anyone seek-
ing the release of the whistleblower’s
identity is frustrating the truth and is
potentially in violation of Federal law.
Not only that, the disclosure of the
whistleblower’s identity may result in
reprisals and threats to their personal
safety and the safety of their families.
Today, I am sending a letter to the
Secretary and Chief of Staff of the
Army asking them to provide us with
what actions the Army is taking to en-
sure that Lieutenant Colonel Vindman
is afforded appropriate protections.
Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and whis-
tleblowers like him are standing up for
the Constitution they swore an oath to
defend. Their lives and families must
not be put in jeopardy by an out-
rageous attack or disclosure.
HEALTHCARE
Mr. President, now on healthcare,
today the Senate will hold a vote on a
resolution to repeal a Trump adminis-
tration rule promoting junk health in-
surance plans, which offer a way
around protections for Americans with
preexisting conditions. The adminis-
tration has worked to make it easier
for States to use taxpayer dollars to
subsidize these junk insurance plans,
many of which don’t cover essential
benefits, like maternity care, preven-
tive screening, and mental healthcare.
These junk plans leave families vulner-
able and are nothing but a boon to
health insurance companies.
For nearly 3 years, Republicans in
Congress and the Trump administra-
tion have sabotaged Americans’
healthcare. Funding to sign up Ameri-
cans for health insurance has been
eliminated. Programs to help low-in-
come Americans afford insurance has
been canceled. President Trump’s
budgets have threatened deep cuts to
Medicare and Medicaid. Now, the
Trump administration is suing to re-
peal the entirety of the healthcare law.
Yesterday—just yesterday—new data
showed that 400,000 fewer kids have
health insurance now, most of whom
are under 6—innocents. When they
have bad health, they need help. That
breaks your heart. The effect of all this
sabotage is very, very real.
Now, think about this issue, about
protections for Americans with pre-
existing conditions. Think of a mom or
dad who has a son or daughter and they
discover that he or she has cancer.
They go to the doctor, and the doctor
says: Look, I have this very expensive
medication or this expensive treatment
that will help cure your child, but the
insurance policy doesn’t cover it.
The family doesn’t have enough
money to pay for it, and they watch
their child suffer. That should not hap-
pen in America. We want to prevent it
from happening.
That is why we hope our colleagues
will join us in this CRA to overturn
what the administration has done that
would allow that terrible example to go
forward.
Let me continue on healthcare for a
minute. Despite making explicit prom-
ises to defend protections for Ameri-
cans with preexisting conditions in
campaign ads—I even heard some speak
about it as recently as yesterday—Re-
publicans have voted to undermine
these protections in Congress on sev-
eral occasions. There is no getting
around the fact that junk insurance
plans offer a way around these impor-
tant protections and drive costs up for
everyone else.
Do Republicans want to use taxpayer
dollars to fund these junk plans and
add to insurance company profits?
I hope not, but we will see today.
Today, my Republican colleagues face
a test. They can vote to defend
healthcare protections for Americans
who need it most or they can stand
with President Trump and vote to
allow these junk health insurance
plans with so many devastating effects
on so many families flood the market.
SYRIA
Mr. President, finally, on Syria, we
were informed yesterday that after
multiple requests, the Senate will fi-
nally receive an all-Member briefing by
the administration on the situation in
northern Syria this afternoon. I am
glad the briefing is taking place, but it
is regrettable that it has even taken
this long.
Secretary Pompeo also will not par-
ticipate, which is profoundly dis-
appointing, given that we must hear
from the Secretary of State at times
and on issues such as this.
Nevertheless, those members of the
administration who will be there today
must answer several important ques-
tions. What is our strategy moving for-
ward on northern Syria? How are we
going to protect troops and our na-
tional interest? And, most impor-
tantly, exactly what is our plan to en-
sure the enduring defeat of ISIS and to
make sure that those who are still im-
prisoned don’t escape and those who
have already escaped don’t hurt us?
These urgent questions go to the
heart of America’s national security,
and we need them answered today.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

DEATH OF ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, ISIS took
a big hit over the weekend when U.S.
forces raided ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-
Baghdadi’s compound in Syria. Al-
Baghdadi died in the raid after he deto-
nated a suicide vest in a final act of
cowardice, killing three children with
him. The second in command was con-
firmed killed in a second military
strike hours later, leaving the organi-
zation temporarily leaderless.
Over the past few years, ISIS has
spilled a river of blood across the Mid-
dle East. Its brutality has set it apart
even among other terrorist organiza-
tions. Torture, rape, enslavement, cru-
cifixions, beheadings, and the delib-
erate targeting of whole populations
based on their religious beliefs—the
list of crimes is long and often nearly
unspeakable.
The world is a safer place today be-
cause of al-Baghdadi’s death. This im-
pact will only be temporary unless we
dedicate ourselves to ensuring that
ISIS is permanently defeated.
The successful raid on al-Baghdadi’s
compound is a reminder of the fact
that our military may be called on at
a moment’s notice to head halfway
around the world to fight evil. The men
and women of the U.S. military stand
on guard 24 hours a day, 365 days a
year, ready to put themselves between
us and danger.
This past weekend, I had the honor of
helping to welcome home 112 South Da-
kota Army National Guard soldiers of
the 147th Forward Support Company
and Bravo Battery of the 147th Field
Artillery Battalion. These citizen sol-
diers were in Europe for nearly a year
working with our NATO allies and in-
creasing unit readiness.
As Members of Congress, we have no
more fundamental responsibility than
ensuring that our men and women in
uniform are prepared to meet any
threat. We do that by providing timely
and adequate funding for the current
and future needs of our Armed Forces.
That means funding the military
through regular order appropriation
bills—not through temporary funding
measures that leave the military in
doubt about funding levels and unable
to start essential new projects.
Unfortunately, our efforts to fund
the military in a timely fashion have
been stymied by Democrats who
blocked the Senate from passing the
Defense appropriations bill in Sep-
tember before the end of the fiscal

year. We are now a month into the new
fiscal year, and Democrats are still in-
dicating that they intend to block this
year’s Defense appropriations bill.
Let me briefly review what Demo-
crats are blocking. They are blocking
funding to support a pay increase for
our military men and women. They are
blocking funding for weapons and
equipment that our troops need right
now. They are blocking investment in
the equipment and technology that our
military will need to defeat the threats
of the future. They are blocking fund-
ing for missile defense, for research
and development, for ships, planes, and
combat vehicles to update our aging
fleets, and they are blocking funding
for our allies, including $250 million in
military assistance for Ukraine.
Let me just repeat that last point.
Democrats, who are currently trying to
impeach the President for allegedly de-
laying Ukraine funding, are currently
blocking $250 million in assistance for
Ukraine. Now, I am pretty sure that is
the definition, if you look it up, of both
irony and hypocrisy.
Toward the end of the summer, it
looked like Democrats might actually
be willing to work with Republicans to
pass this year’s appropriations bills.
Both Democrats and Republicans
agreed to a bipartisan deal laying out
funding levels for both defense and
nondefense spending, but, apparently,
that was as far as Senate Democrats
were prepared to go. Now that it has
come time to honor the spirit of that
agreement and get this year’s Defense
appropriations bill done, Senate Demo-
crats are balking.
Democrats would like us to believe
they are serious about legislating; that
their yearslong obsession with im-
peaching the President isn’t dis-
tracting them from doing their job.
Well, they are going to have a chance
to prove that in the very near future.
If Democrats are actually serious
about legislating, if they are serious
about meeting their responsibilities,
then they will work with Republicans
to move forward on the Defense appro-
priations bill and to get this legislation
to the President as soon as possible. I
hope that is what they will choose to
do.
As Chairman SHELBY noted on the
floor last week, Congress’s failure to do
its job and fund our military is making
the military’s job more difficult, and
that, as Chairman SHELBY noted, is un-
acceptable. It should be unacceptable
to all of us. It is time to get our men
and women in uniform the funding
they need and the pay increase they de-
serve. It is time to get this year’s De-
fense appropriations bill done. It is
time for the Democrats to stop stalling
and foot-dragging and blocking, and for
them to work with us to make sure our
men and women in uniform have what
they need to protect Americans and
keep us safe.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, at
12:15 p.m., the Senate will vote on a
Democratic proposal to overturn a
Trump administration guidance from
the Department of Health and Human
Services that would lower insurance
rates all across America. Seems like a
strange thing to do, but to justify that,
the Democrats have come up with a
scary fairytale that has no basis in
truth, that suggests that somehow this
effort to lower insurance rates would
jeopardize the protection for pre-
existing conditions that all Americans
have according to the law. Of course,
that can’t happen because the law
doesn’t permit it. So I want to talk
about that a little bit today.
What the Senate Democrats want to
overturn is a Trump administration
guidance regarding what is called a
section 1332 waiver. Now, a 1332 waiver
was part of the Affordable Care Act of
2010 that Democrats passed. No Repub-
lican voted for it. So you had the Af-
fordable Care Act, which says, among
other things, that every American who
has a preexisting health condition is
protected. That means that if I have a
preexisting health condition, and I
want to buy insurance, I have a right
to buy it. I can’t be charged any more
for it because of my preexisting health
condition, and I am covered if I get
sick. That is what we mean by protec-
tion for preexisting conditions. That is
in the Federal law. No American can be
denied that protection.
In the very same law, the Affordable
Care Act, Democrats wrote another
provision to give States more flexi-
bility in how they spend ObamaCare
money with the hope that they might
be able to lower rates for Americans
who have health insurance. That would
be a good thing because in Tennessee,
and across the country, really, since
ObamaCare passed, rates have gone up
163 percent. Those rate increases espe-
cially hurt people who make a little bit
more than $50,000—say a songwriter in
Nashville or a farmer like Marty,
whom I ran into in the Chick-fil-A out-
side Nashville, who said: I can’t afford
health insurance. I have to pay $15,000
or $20,000 because I don’t get any
ObamaCare subsidy.
States are trying to take advantage
of this provision of the Affordable Care
Act—ObamaCare—that says States
may have some flexibility in how they
spend Obamacare money. The law also
says states cannot jeopardize pre-
existing conditions protections for any-
body.
Now, the best evidence that what we
are talking about is a scary fairytale is
that 12 States already have used a 1332
waiver. Remember, this is the provi-
sion in the Federal law that was de-
signed to give States more flexibility
in how they spend Federal dollars.
Twelve States have already used that
provision in law to lower rates. There
are 12 waivers from States that have
been approved by the Trump adminis-
tration, and premiums have gone down
in all 12 States as a result of this ac-
tion. This is what the Democrats want
to stop. They want to stop States from
using this provision which the Demo-
crats invented in 2010 to lower insur-
ance rates. That is why it is a scary
fairytale that only on Halloween any-
body could imagine could come up
with.
Now, 7 of the 12 waivers that were ap-
proved by the Trump administration
were under an Obama definition of Sec-
tion 1332, and 5 have been approved
since the new guidance that is the sub-
ject of the vote today. For any State to
get a 1332 waiver, the Centers for Medi-
care and Medicaid Services has to ap-
prove it. Seema Verma is the Adminis-
trator of that agency. She has made it
very clear, No. 1, that none of the 12
waivers that have been approved jeop-
ardize preexisting health condition
protections for anybody. In other
words, the waivers did lower rates for
some people, but they didn’t hurt any-
one’s ability to buy insurance who had
a preexisting condition. Just because it
helped some people didn’t mean it hurt
other people.
Seema Verma went on to say very
clearly:
To be very clear, the 2018 guidance—
The one we are talking about today—
does nothing to erode ObamaCare’s pre-
existing condition provisions, which cannot
be waived under Section 1332.
In other words, the law the Demo-
crats wrote in 2010 does not allow
States to waive the preexisting condi-
tion. Seema Verma goes on to say:
‘‘Section 1332 does not permit States to
waive Public Health Services Act require-
ments such as guaranteed availability and
renewability of health insurance, the prohi-
bition on using health status to vary pre-
miums, and the prohibition on preexisting
conditions exclusions. Furthermore, a sec-
tion 1332 waiver cannot be approved that
might otherwise undermine these require-
ments. This administration stands com-
mitted to protecting people with preexisting
conditions.’’
The bottom line is, 12 States have al-
ready used section 1332 waivers to re-
duce premiums. More States want to
come up with other ideas to do the
same. In none of the 12 States were pre-
existing condition protections jeopard-
ized for one single person. Seema
Verma says it cannot be, under the
law, and if any of the other States have
some sort of new proposal—she
wouldn’t approve it.
There is no doubt there is a good rea-
son why so many Governors may want
1332 waivers. In fact, many of the
States that have already been granted
waivers have Democratic Senators as
well as Democratic Governors. Many
States are trying to reduce health in-
surance rates because ObamaCare has
driven those rates so high. In the four

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6266 October 30, 2019
bipartisan Health Committee hearings
I chaired in September of 2017, vir-
tually, every witness told our com-
mittee that the process of applying for
a 1332 waiver was too cumbersome, too
inflexible, and expensive for States to
use.
In the fall of 2017, provisions to im-
prove that waiver application process
were included in bipartisan legislation
that was proposed by 12 Republican
Senators and 12 Democratic Senators.
At one point, the distinguished Senator
from New York, the minority leader,
Senator SCHUMER, said it was such
good policy that every Democrat ought
to vote for it.
In 2018, Senate Democrats blocked
that bipartisan legislation, which
would have, by the way, lowered insur-
ance premiums by 40 percent over 3
years, and it became clear Democrats
were refusing to change even a word of
ObamaCare.
I encouraged Secretary Azar and the
administration to take a look at the
section 1332 waiver and, within the cur-
rent law, do whatever they could to
give States more flexibility. Fourteen
Governors wrote the Secretary seeking
help to make 1332 waivers work so they
could start lowering premiums in their
State.
In October of 2018, the Trump admin-
istration issued new guidance with
much needed flexibility so States can
use 1332 waivers. Democrats who vote
at 12:15 to overturn this guidance are
taking a tool away from their States, a
tool that many States want, to lower
health insurance rates and, in every
single case, without jeopardizing pro-
tection for preexisting conditions.
That was the whole purpose of the
1332 waiver. That is why Democrats put
it in the Affordable Care Act. That is
why 13 States have approved those
waivers and 12 have been approved just
for one type of solution called reinsur-
ance. That is when States take some
money and put it in a reinsurance pool.
A State can take the sickest people in
that State and put them there. When
the sickest people are out of the other
pool, it lowers rates for the people who
are left. States can do reinsurance with
Obamacare money. States lower health
insurance rates for these people in the
pool. You make sure the people who
are sickest have insurance, and you
don’t take away anyone’s right to buy
insurance who has a preexisting condi-
tion.
In each of the States, health insur-
ance premiums have gone down as
much as 43 percent in some cases.
North Dakota has seen the average
ObamaCare premium decrease 20 per-
cent; Colorado, 16 percent; Delaware, 13
percent; Montana, 8 percent; Rhode Is-
land, 6 percent. You want to overturn a
guidance that attempts to give States
more of that same kind of flexibility to
lower insurance premiums without af-
fecting the ability of any American to
buy insurance with preexisting condi-
tion protections? There is no reason
States shouldn’t be able to have that
flexibility.
Let me give you an example of what
this guidance that we are talking
about today would mean. In 2017, Iowa
submitted a waiver application that
would have restructured the premium
subsidies. That is the money Iowa gets
from Washington under ObamaCare.
According to Iowa Governor Kim Rey-
nolds, Iowa’s waiver would have given
18,000 to 22,000 Iowans access to more
affordable insurance. These were
Iowans who made too much to qualify
for Federal subsidies and were left be-
hind by ObamaCare’s skyrocketing
profits. This might be a farmer in Iowa
making $55,000 a year and, with no sub-
sidy, paying $15,000 or $20,000 for an in-
surance policy. The rates would be
lower under Iowa’s proposal.
Under the old guidance, Iowa’s inno-
vative waiver couldn’t be approved.
Now, with the new guidance—the one
you seek to overturn today—Iowa can
work with Administrator Verma to get
the kind of creative waiver so 18,000–
22,000 more Iowans can afford health
insurance. To be clear—to emphasize—
just as with the other 12 examples that
have been approved, no new waiver can
be approved that would take away the
right of any Iowan who has a pre-
existing health condition to buy insur-
ance at the same price as if that person
didn’t have a preexisting health condi-
tion and to keep insurance coverage
when that Iowan gets sick.
It is simply a scary Halloween fairy-
tale drummed up by the other side—for
reasons I can’t imagine since so many
of their States are benefiting from 1332
waivers—to take away from States the
ability to reduce health insurance
costs. As I said earlier, any waiver that
is approved—as 12 already have been—
to help some people get lower cost
health insurance cannot hurt another
person in that State by taking away
their right to buy insurance at the
same price that covers their pre-
existing condition. States with 1332
waivers include these States with
Democratic Senators who will be vot-
ing today: Hawaii, Maryland, Min-
nesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Wisconsin.
Do they really want to take away from
their State the ability to lower health
insurance premiums in a way that
doesn’t jeopardize preexisting condi-
tions? That is pretty strange. Then
there is Colorado, Montana, Delaware,
Rhode Island, Alaska, North Dakota—
the same.
I think this just gets back to the
point that Democrats have elevated
ObamaCare to the 67th book of the
Bible, and they can’t change a word of
it, even though they wrote the 1332
waiver in the Affordable Care Act to
give States the flexibility to reduce
healthcare premiums, which 12 States
now have done. Democrats also wrote,
in the Affordable Care Act, that you
cannot take away from any American
the right to buy insurance at the same
price if you have a preexisting health
condition. That has been reaffirmed by
the Trump administration. It is in the
law. To suggest otherwise, as I said
earlier, is a scary fairytale dreamed up
for Halloween.
I hope that all Senators—especially
from those States who have seen the
1332 waiver work so well—will vote not
to overturn the guidance that gives
more Americans a chance to pay lower
healthcare premiums.
I yield the floor.

SASSE). The Senator from Wisconsin.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1556
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise
to join my colleague Senator MARK
WARNER and the entire Senate Demo-
cratic caucus to force a vote on his res-
olution to protect Americans with pre-
existing health conditions and stop the
Trump administration from using
American taxpayer dollars to promote
junk insurance plans that don’t even
have to cover people who have pre-
existing health conditions.
The difference between the two sides
of the aisle here is really clear. The
Senate Republicans have worked with
President Trump to pass repeal plans
that would take people’s healthcare
away and allow insurance companies to
charge more for people with pre-
existing health conditions.
When their effort failed legislatively,
instead of working in a bipartisan way
to lower healthcare costs for working
families, President Trump and his ad-
ministration spent 2 years working to
sabotage our healthcare system. The
Trump administration’s sabotage has
made it harder for people to sign up for
quality, affordable coverage, and there
are more Americans who are uninsured
today than when President Trump took
office.
The Trump administration is even in
court to support a lawsuit to overturn
the Affordable Care Act completely,
which will take away guaranteed
health protections and raise costs for
Americans with preexisting health con-
ditions. If they succeed, insurance com-
panies will again be able to deny cov-
erage or charge higher premiums for
nearly 130 million Americans who have
preexisting health conditions.
Meanwhile, this administration has
expanded what we call junk insurance
plans. These are plans that can deny
coverage to people with preexisting
health conditions and don’t have to
cover essential services like prescrip-
tion drugs, emergency room visits, and
maternity care.
I ask my friends on the other side of
the aisle to think about this for a mo-
ment. President Trump supports over-
turning the law that provides protec-
tions for people with preexisting health
conditions while he expands these junk
plans that don’t provide those protec-
tions. This is what the Senate Repub-
licans support. This is their plan.
Last year, we forced a vote on my
legislation to block President Trump’s
expansion of junk insurance plans that
don’t have to cover people with pre-
existing health conditions. The final
vote tally was 50 to 50, with the entire
Senate Democratic Caucus and one

Senate Republican voting in support of
my legislation. Those who say they
support healthcare coverage for people
with preexisting health conditions
should support the No Junk Plans Act.
Today, I want to take another vote.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committee on Health,
Education, Labor, and Pensions be dis-
charged from further consideration of
S. 1556 and that the Senate proceed to
its immediate consideration; that the
bill be considered read a third time and
passed; and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon
the table with no intervening action or
debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Tennessee.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in
reserving the right to object, the Sen-
ator from Wisconsin is exactly correct.
Every Senate Democrat has voted to
take away a low-cost insurance option
from what the Urban Institute says is
1.7 million Americans. These people
can’t afford other kinds of insurance.
That is what they want to take away,
and she is attempting to do that once
again. I have plenty of constituents
who have a right to get their insurance
but who can’t afford it. This is the only
kind of insurance they can buy.
This kind of insurance was good
enough for the George W. Bush admin-
istration. It was good enough for the
Clinton administration. It was good
enough for the Obama administration
right up until the last few days, and it
should be good enough under the
Trump administration.
According to the Urban Institute, all
the Trump short term plan rule does is
give 1.7 million Americans an oppor-
tunity to buy short-term insurance
while they move from one job to an-
other or while they look for a different
situation. According to the Urban In-
stitute, those 1.7 million Americans
would otherwise go uninsured, and that
is what the Democrats are for.
I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Wisconsin.
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, obvi-
ously, I am disappointed with the ob-
jection.
I would point out that these junk
plans are often called short-term plans,
but the change that was made by this
administration was to go from a 3-
month sort of transition plan that, as
my colleague indicates, could be used
when one changes employment or other
short-term use, and now they are avail-
able and renewable for up to 3 years.
These plans do not preserve the protec-
tions under the Affordable Care Act to
cover people with preexisting health
conditions and essential health bene-
fits.
You don’t have to take my word for
it. We can read directly from the fine
print on the actual plans that are being
debated.
One of these junk plans from Com-
panion Life, which is currently avail-
able in my home State of Wisconsin,
reads: ‘‘This plan has a pre-existing
limitation provision that may prevent
coverage from applying to medical con-
ditions that existed prior to this plan
effective date.’’
Another junk plan from Golden Rule
says that the plan doesn’t comply with
the guaranteed essential benefits pro-
vided by the Affordable Care Act.
To quote directly from the plan, the
description reads: ‘‘Even if you have
had prior Golden Rule coverage and
your preexisting conditions were cov-
ered under that plan, they will not be
covered under this plan.’’
It is abundantly clear that these
plans don’t cover protections for people
with preexisting conditions.
The people of Wisconsin did not send
me to Washington to take away peo-
ple’s healthcare. I want to protect the
guaranteed healthcare coverage that
millions of Americans depend on. I
want to help more families get the
quality, affordable healthcare they
need.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1905
Despite the sabotage that I have de-
scribed from this administration
against the Affordable Care Act, in
Wisconsin this year, things are getting
better with the new Governor. Thanks
to strong leadership from Governor
Evers and the investments his adminis-
tration is making, Wisconsinites will
have more choices and more affordable
rates for quality health insurance
plans this year. Wisconsinites in every
corner of the State will be able to find
healthcare plans this year that include
essential benefits like prescription
drug coverage, maternity care, emer-
gency room visits, and mental
healthcare at more affordable prices.
Governor Evers is providing funding
for more health insurance navigators
and is conducting awareness campaigns
in the State so that families in Wis-
consin will have the information they
need to sign up for quality and com-
prehensive healthcare plans. That is
why enrollment navigators are so im-
portant. We need to keep up the fund-
ing for navigator programs so that
more people can find affordable
healthcare plans that meet their needs.
Navigators help millions of Americans,
including those in rural communities,
sign up for quality healthcare cov-
erage.
The Governor of Wisconsin under-
stands the importance of navigators,
but Washington has failed to step up.
Unfortunately, since President Trump
took office, his administration has
slashed Federal funding for the navi-
gator program by 84 percent. Trusted
navigator programs, like those in Wis-
consin, have had their funding cut by
nearly 75 percent since 2017, meaning
fewer people in Wisconsin have re-
ceived the support they need to obtain
affordable coverage.
That is why I introduced the EN-
ROLL Act this year with my good
friend from Pennsylvania, Senator
CASEY. This bill restores funding for
the navigator program and helps to en-
sure that Americans have better access
to the affordable healthcare coverage
that they need and want. The ENROLL
Act passed the House of Representa-
tives earlier this year. We should also
pass it in the Senate so that Americans
can more easily enroll in quality
healthcare coverage.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committee on Health,
Education, Labor, and Pensions be dis-
charged from further consideration of
S. 1905 and that the Senate proceed to
its immediate consideration; that the
bill be considered read a third time and
passed; and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon
the table with no intervening action or
debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Tennessee.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in
reserving the right to object, in 2017,
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services found that navigators were
not cost-effective in enrolling people in
health insurance.
During the 2017 open enrollment pe-
riod, navigators received over $62.5 mil-
lion in Federal grants while enrolling
81,426 individuals. That is less than 1
percent of those enrolled in the Federal
exchanges, which comes out to a cost
of $767 per enrollee. In other words, the
taxpayer is paying $767 per enrollee for
each person enrolled. The CMS also
found that nearly 80 percent of the
navigators failed to reach their enroll-
ment goals.
I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Wisconsin.
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I am
disappointed to see my Republican col-
league again object to the legislation
that will help more Americans access
quality, private health insurance, Med-
icaid, or the Children’s Health Insur-
ance Program. This is especially harm-
ful to families in rural communities
who already lack access to in-person
assistance for shopping and enrolling
in quality, affordable health insurance
coverage.
So let me lay plain for everyone what
we are seeing here from the Repub-
licans and this administration.
Today, the Republicans objected to
passing my ENROLL Act, which would
provide funding for healthcare enroll-
ment assistance to help people find
high-quality, affordable plans that
would actually meet their healthcare
needs.
Today, the Republicans objected to
passing my legislation to stop the ex-
pansion of junk insurance plans that
don’t even have to cover people with
preexisting health conditions.
The Republicans are working to
make it harder for one to sign up for
high-quality, affordable healthcare.
This administration is encouraging
Americans to buy junk insurance plans
that don’t provide the health coverage

that they need and that can deny cov-
erage to people who have preexisting
health conditions.
Finally, the Republicans and the
Trump administration are supporting a
lawsuit that would overturn the entire
Affordable Care Act and take
healthcare away from literally mil-
lions of American families.
The choice for the American people
could not be clearer. I am working with
my Democratic colleagues to help
make things better for the American
people. Sadly, the Senate Republicans
are helping the Trump administration
make things worse. I will not give up
this fight.

S.J. RES. 52
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, we are
going to vote on a CRA later this after-
noon, and this has been the issue domi-
nating D.C. and did in my campaign:
the cost of healthcare.
I am going to vote against the CRA,
and I am not going to go into the par-
ticularities of it. I just want to tell you
how it works on Main Street USA and
kind of my perspective of how we real-
ly solve healthcare in a way that is
going to be affordable and last for a
long time.
I just finished visiting all 92 counties
in Indiana talking to Hoosiers, young
and old, small businesses to farms. Ev-
eryone is concerned about where is
healthcare cost going in the future.
We don’t seem to, here, have a real
good plan for it. As a Main Street en-
trepreneur that took it on myself a few
years ago to create a sustainable, af-
fordable plan, most people think it ab-
solutely can’t happen using free mar-
ket principles. I will go into a few de-
tails of how that works in my own
business.
ObamaCare was addressing an issue
that has been boiling up for a long
time. I took on the insurance compa-
nies to fix it in my own company back
in 2008—covered preexisting conditions,
no caps on coverage.
But ObamaCare was a solution that
was never going to work. It was Big
Healthcare in cahoots with Big Govern-
ment. Never have I seen that result in
something less expensive and more ef-
fective.
I believe in free markets driving the
solutions, and the healthcare industry
is who I blame for being in this pickle.
That sounds unusual coming from a
free market guy that doesn’t believe in
government.
But not all markets are free. One of
the most disappointing things is when
my own Republican colleagues mistake
the healthcare industry for being one
that is free and transparent. It has
evolved over the years to where it has
become as bloated and dysfunctional as
the Federal Government that runs tril-
lion-dollar deficits.
ObamaCare decisions are made by
healthcare industry executives and
Federal Government bureaucrats, in-
stead of by patients, employees, and
mostly employers who are the only
ones that really have skin in the game
when it comes to our healthcare sys-
tem.
I believe the underlying principles of
ObamaCare were right on. No one
should go broke because they get sick
or have a bad accident.
I believe that you cover preexisting
conditions with no caps on coverage.
Kids staying on the plan until they are
26? Fine. But it didn’t work from the
beginning, and it won’t be an afford-
able—it was the Affordable Care Act. It
turned into the un-Affordable Care Act,
and it is not a solution in the long run.
The solution will be to get the indus-
try out of the doldrums and to realize
that when 80 Senators weigh in with an
idea of how to fix your business, the
cat is out of the bag. You have a prob-
lem. Sadly, in a place like this, which
you can see can get sidetracked in so
many different ways and then never
really craft solutions that last in the
long run, that is kind of what we are up
against now.
The bills that have come through
from three different committees—pri-
marily Finance and the one I am on,
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions—do some good things. Senator
GRASSLEY and I did an op-ed this week
about negotiating drug prices in a way
that is going to bring them down.
These bills have real things that will
work. I am disappointed that they are
not aggressive enough, but we need to
start somewhere.
The drug companies have been noto-
riously involved in—after they do such
a good job coming up with a solution,
a remedy, then hand it over to a bro-
ken distribution system that ends up—
and I will tell a little story.
When I was uninsured, after I had to
get off my great company’s insurance
that was based upon wellness, not re-
mediation, and my employees and pa-
tients were encouraged on dollar one to
shop around and find solutions—that
worked. Here, the industry does every-
thing it can to not make it work. This
should have been a simple thing to do.
Luckily, I don’t have many prescrip-
tions. I knew it was a generic that
should cost 15 to 20 bucks. I had six or
seven places to choose from in my
hometown. I went to the first one that
would have been the most convenient
and fumbled around for 2, 3, 4 minutes.
They kept asking me what my insur-
ance plan number was. I said: I have
none. I am uninsured. I want your best
deal.
It came back $34.50.
I made another call to a place that I
know has been on the leading edge. It
took them 10 seconds, $10, and they
said: By the way, we can have it ready
in 10 minutes.
That is the way things worked in the
real world.
Any of us that run businesses where
you have transparency, competition—
take LASIK surgery for instance. It is
the only part of healthcare that actu-
ally works. Do you know why? Insur-
ance companies aren’t involved. Pro-
viders deal with patients, consumers.
Ten, 12 years ago, $2,000 to $2,500 an
eye, done with a scalpel. Now the tech-
nology is better, and you can get it
done for $250 to $500 an eye. That is the
way things should work.
The solution is not more of what we
tried that has failed. It certainly isn’t
Medicaid for All. How can that work
when, if you are honest about how
much it is going to cost, it would near-
ly double the size of our Federal Gov-
ernment. Plus, why would you turn
something like that over when we can’t
even get it right in the Veterans’ Ad-
ministration, where about 10 million
patients are covered, not 330 million?
That would be jumping from the frying
pan into the fire. It would be a dis-
aster. We can’t afford it. Of course, no
one around here ever asks the question
about how you pay for anything.
We are going to completely exhaust
the Medicare trust fund in 6 to 7 years.
Employers and employees have been
paying into that since the 1960s. That
will probably be the first reality check
this place has—maybe along with the
fact that foreign countries and every-
one else are not going to keep lending
us money to finance trillion-dollar
deficits—which, by the way, will hit
$1.5 trillion in 6 to 7 years, when the in-
terest on the debt is going to be more
than we are paying for defense.
In conclusion, our healthcare system
needs radical change, but it needs to be
changed in a way that takes the power
from the industry and government and
gives it back to the patient/consumer,
like it works in the real world.
I will use this example: I know that
in my hometown, if you are buying a
big-screen TV—which, by the way,
costs about one-fourth to one-third of
what it did 10 years ago, kind of like
LASIK surgery—I know people in my
hometown would probably drive 50, 60
miles to save 50 bucks on a thousand-
dollar purchase. We don’t do that. The
healthcare consumer has atrophied.
They talk about they love employer-
provided insurance. Well, that is be-
cause the consumer pays for very little
of it.
I will give a few details of what can
happen when you are innovative, when
you incorporate the concepts of skin-
in-the-game, doing more than asking
others to pay for it. In our own plan,
people enter their deductible less than
they did 11 years ago because the in-
centives were put in place. But I found
a way to do it uniquely, where most
CEOs didn’t want to take the risk.
I believe in insurance for everyone. I
believe in access. You heard me earlier.
In this day and age, preexisting condi-
tions—that ship has sailed. I backed

that up with actions in my own busi-
ness. But I don’t believe that you can
take more of what is proven never to
work and try to get it to be where it is
twice the size of our current govern-
ment.
Republicans can lead on healthcare
but only if we stop acting as apologists
for a healthcare industry that is dys-
functional and broken to the core, and
then you set yourself up, for politicians
here—and a public that generally falls
for it—that that is going to be the so-
lution.
On our first foray into surrendering
that right to the government through
ObamaCare, it yielded what it was pre-
dicted to—higher costs and fewer op-
tions.
The only prescription for our ailing
healthcare system is consumer-driven,
transparent competition. I look for-
ward to unveiling more of those ideas,
and that is why I will vote against the
CRA this afternoon.
I put the challenge and the onus on
the back of the healthcare industry to
get with it before you have a business
partner that you are not going to
like—the Federal Government.
I yield the floor.

ator from Washington.
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak as in
morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
REMEMBERING KAY HAGAN
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, while
I am so sad to be here, I am always
glad to have the opportunity to recog-
nize Senator Kay Hagan.
There are certain people who carry
with them a warmth and kindness that
lift up others, even in places that are
not always warm or kind and even
when the going gets tough. Kay was ex-
actly that kind of person and one of
the best examples I can think of. She
wasn’t only that—not at all. As an-
other mom in the Senate, I saw how
deeply she was dedicated to her fam-
ily—her husband, Chip, and her chil-
dren, Jeannette, Tilden, and Carrie.
Kay was smart, witty, and fierce, and
she was an unwavering champion for
North Carolina families and commu-
nities.
Nine years ago almost to this week,
Kay came to the floor to advocate for
health reform, and she did it as she al-
ways did—by putting North Caro-
linians first.
Kay came here and she shared the
story of Tim and Marilyn, a family
from Mooresville, NC. They had racked
up tens of thousands of dollars in debt
because Marilyn’s preexisting condi-
tion meant her only option was a high-
cost, high-deductible plan. Kay called
powerfully for protections for pre-
existing conditions.
Nearly a decade has now passed since
the Affordable Care Act became law, so
not everyone remembers how, in that
fight, every single Senate vote
mattered, and there were certainly
some Senators who listened to the pun-
dits and the naysayers at the time who
wanted the bill to fail. Kay tuned out
all of that and listened to people from
her home State, like Tim and Marilyn,
instead, and because she did, more than
4 million North Carolinians with pre-
existing conditions have protections in
law today. They have the peace of mind
Kay wanted so badly for Tim and
Marilyn and every one of her constitu-
ents.
Democrats are going to be talking a
lot about healthcare this week, and in
particular, we are taking a very impor-
tant vote on upholding those protec-
tions that Kay fought so hard for. So
especially throughout this week, I will
be thinking about Kay. I will be think-
ing about the difference her love for
her State has made in the lives of peo-
ple across North Carolina and our
country. I will be grateful, as so many
others are, for her amazing friendship,
her wisdom, and her willingness to
stand up for what is right.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
DAINES). Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
S.J. RES. 52
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it has
been just over 2 years since the Senate
voted down legislation that would have
repealed the Affordable Care Act. If we
had voted down the Affordable Care
Act, that would have also erased the
protections for Americans with pre-
existing medical conditions.
In the time since then, two things
have happened. One, my colleagues
from across the aisle have read the
writing on the wall. They recognized
that the American people support the
protections for preexisting conditions
on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis;
and, two, the Trump administration re-
leased the rule that we are discussing
today—a rule that would allow tax-
payer dollars to subsidize these short-
term junk plans that actively under-
mine the insurance market and jeop-
ardize the one very popular part of the
ACA, protecting folks with preexisting
conditions.
I know that my colleague, Senator
BALDWIN, was here earlier, and Senator
BROWN, Senator WYDEN, and Senator
MURRAY. They have outlined in some
detail the challenges around these junk
plans, or some refer to them as short-
term plans. The truth is, these plans
don’t have to cover things such as
emergency room visits, maternity care,
or other essential benefits, and they
once again allow insurance companies
to discriminate against Americans
based on their medical history.
With all due respect to my Repub-
lican colleagues, you can’t have it both
ways. If you support protections for
preexisting conditions, you can’t sit by
and let this administration dismantle
them. You have to stand up and defend
these protections because, as you
know, folks in Virginia are depending
on them and constituents in your
States are as well.
Very shortly, each Member of this
body will have a chance to go on the
record with this resolution of dis-
approval.
I fear some Members of this body
have forgotten what it was like before
the ACA, when an unexpected surgery
or a diagnosis of a chronic illness could
mean a one-way ticket out of the mid-
dle class.
Unfortunately, this is not a hypo-
thetical. Earlier today, a group of us
had a press conference where a young
woman from my State came forward,
and not only did her child have an
enormous medical condition, but her
husband was then diagnosed with
lymphoma, and she was diagnosed with
brain cancer.
Without the protections of the ACA,
she testified she would not be able to
afford healthcare coverage.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time is expired.
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent for an additional 3
minutes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. WARNER. I will speed this up.
Let me also point out that, recently,
one of my constituents, a man named
Jesse, received a $230,000 medical bill
for his back surgery. Unbeknownst to
him, he purchased one of these so-
called short-term junk plans only to
discover that he now fell into the cat-
egory of having a preexisting condi-
tion, and this plan didn’t cover his
challenge.
Jesse is 1 of the more than 3 million
Virginians with a preexisting medical
condition. Nationwide, more than 130
million Americans have preexisting
medical conditions like diabetes, asth-
ma, or cancer.
Before the Affordable Care Act, an
insurance company had every right to
deny these individuals coverage,
charge them unaffordable premiums, or
terminate their plans. We cannot go
back to those days.
Unfortunately, this administration
has used every tool at its disposal to
destabilize the market in the hopes
that it will come crashing down so
they can finally repeal the ACA.
The rule we are talking about here
today is a perfect example, among
many others, of what this administra-
tion has done. They have defunded
cost-sharing payments that reduce pre-
miums in the marketplace. They have
shortened the enrollment period and
cut the budget for outreach naviga-
tors—all folks who have helped Ameri-
cans find a plan that works best for
them.

strike down the health insurance sys-
tem as we know it, with no replace-
ment plan in place.
The truth is, if these protections for
people with preexisting conditions are
going to survive, we have to have a sta-
ble insurance market.
We can and should have legitimate
debates about 1332 waivers. Certain
States have used those in a very pro-
ductive way, but that is not what we
are talking about today.
The Trump administration’s rule is
not a good-faith effort to bring down
costs or drive innovation. It is a direct
effort to undermine the stability of the
insurance market and is an attack on
the viability of protections for Ameri-
cans with preexisting conditions.
Again, I know we are going to vote
on this CRA action very shortly. I urge
my Republican colleagues to support it
so folks with preexisting conditions
can go about their daily lives knowing
they will be protected.
Thank you. I appreciate the courtesy
of my colleagues giving me those extra
couple of minutes.
With that, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I
know it is Halloween, and it is time for
trick or treat, but I urge my colleagues
not to be tricked by this scary fairy-
tale dreamed up by the Democrats that
would suggest that the section 1332
waiver that give States more flexi-
bility, which they wrote, somehow
jeopardizes protections for people with
preexisting health conditions, which
they also wrote. Both are in the 2010
ObamaCare law.
Preexisting health conditions are
protected. The law says so. The law
does not allow any 1332 waiver, which
is the subject of what we are voting on
in a few minutes, to change that.
Twelve States have had their 1332
waivers approved by the Trump admin-
istration, and in no case did it affect
preexisting conditions.
Seema Verma, who has to approve all
of these waiver applications from the
Department of Health and Human
Services, says the law doesn’t permit
any change in preexisting condition
protections, and if somehow a waiver
asked for it, she would not approve it.
What my Democratic friends are vot-
ing for today is to take away a tool
from States that has been used to re-
duce rates by 43 percent in Maryland,
20 percent in Minnesota, and 15 percent
in New Jersey. It has been used in Ha-
waii, Wisconsin, Colorado, Minnesota,
Delaware, Rhode Island, Alaska, and
North Dakota.
Why would you take away a flexi-
bility option that you wrote to give
your own voters lower health insurance
rates?
I know it is Halloween, but don’t be
tricked. Don’t believe this scary fairy-
tale. Protection for preexisting condi-
tions when you buy health insurance is
the law. Nothing in the 1332 waiver
guidance changes that.
I urge my colleagues to vote no.
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we
will vote to reject yet another attempt
by the Trump administration to sabo-
tage the Affordable Care Act, ACA. The
President has tried to do everything
within his power to dismantle the law.
He has tried to repeal it through Con-
gress twice and failed both times. When
that did not work, his administration
joined Republican State attorneys gen-
eral in a lawsuit that would strike
down the ACA with no plan to replace
it, one of the reasons Congress rejected
his initial repeal efforts. Now, this
President has decided to unravel the
ACA through other means.
We have seen efforts to destabilize
the health insurance market by not
making cost-sharing payments, reduc-
ing funding to help enroll individuals
in plans, or by allowing insurers to sell
less comprehensive plans through
short-term coverage or association
health plans. This administration has
also welcomed waivers from States
that want to restrict Medicaid cov-
erage by conditioning benefits on
whether or not someone has a job.
Throughout its ongoing efforts to
sabotage the ACA, the Trump adminis-
tration issued its rule to allow States
to discriminate against Americans
with preexisting conditions. This rule
gives States new options for pursuing a
section 1332 ‘‘state innovation waiver’’
under the ACA. Section 1332 of the law
gives states additional flexibility to
implement State-specific improve-
ments that expand coverage, reduce
costs, and provide more comprehensive
benefits. I am proud that Vermont was
the first State to apply for a waiver
when the application process first
started in 2016.
Now this administration wants to
significantly change the enforcement
of the four important guardrails en-
acted by Congress that waiver pro-
posals must meet in order to be ap-
proved. These guardrails ensure that
the waivers must offer comprehensive
plans at an affordable rate that protect
patients with preexisting conditions
and do not increase the Federal deficit.
Under this rule, States can increase
costs for vulnerable populations and re-
duce their quality of coverage. That is
unacceptable, especially for this Presi-
dent who promised on the campaign
trail that ‘‘everybody is going to be
taken care of.’’ The intent of the 1332
provision was to let States innovate, so
long as they continue to cover the
same number of people and maintain
the consumer protections set forth in
the law. Vermont’s waiver is consistent
with the ACA and seeks to expand cov-
erage to improve healthcare outcomes
for all Vermonters.
By allowing States to permit the sale
of health insurance plans that do not
cover essential health benefits such as
maternity care, emergency room visits,
or mental healthcare, those that need
comprehensive health insurance cov-
erage will be forced into a high cost
plan, or stuck with an insurance plan
that can deny benefits for whatever
reason. These consumer protections
were at the heart of the ACA and are
why Vermont and a number of other
States have enacted State laws to
maintain these critical protections for
those with preexisting conditions.
Throughout their numerous attempts
to sabotage the ACA, this administra-
tion has made dubious claims that they
support protections for Americans with
preexisting conditions. Certainly, their
well-established record clearly and un-
equivocally refutes this claim. Today,
Senate Republicans can show the
American people that they do genu-
inely want to protect Americans with
cancer, diabetes, arthritis, substance
use disorders, behavioral health dis-
orders, or any of the other preexisting
conditions that States would not have
to cover under this rule.
This vote is about the more than 130
million Americans with a preexisting
condition who need strong protections.
It is about who we are as a nation and
how we care for our people. Congress
must ensure that all Americans have
access to comprehensive, high-quality
health insurance plans that meet their
needs at an affordable rate. The pas-
sage of Senator WARNER’s the Protect
Pre-Existing Conditions Congressional
Review Act resolution would be a step
in the right direction. We must not
send our country back to the days
when insurance companies could dis-
criminate against people with pre-
existing conditions. We must not go
backward.

HEALTHCARE
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, so far,
the 116th Congress has been full of a
number of dubious measures, as I
might characterize them, by our
friends across the aisle as it relates to
our healthcare system.
For starters, our Democratic col-
leagues in the Senate and the House
and on the Presidential campaign trail
are hailing Medicare for All as the gold
standard for healthcare in America.
I was here during the debates over
the Affordable Care Act, and I remem-
ber President Obama’s saying, if you
like your policy, you can keep it and
that if you like your doctor, you can
keep your doctor. Neither one of those
proved to be correct and true. Yet,
here, our Democratic colleagues have
simply given up all pretense and have
embraced a Medicare for All Program
that would outlaw some 180 million
Americans’ private health insurance
policies. In other words, the policy you
get through your employer as part of
the fringe benefits of your employment
would no longer be available under
Medicare for All. This is, of course, so-
cialized medicine, which ensures long
waits for substandard care.
Yes, it is true that I have heard some
say: ‘‘Well, it is Medicare for All. Who
would want it?’’ and others say: ‘‘No. I
am for the public option.’’ Both of
these are slippery slopes into a single-
payer, socialized medicine healthcare
system that will deny consumers the
choices they might prefer to make for
themselves rather than to leave the
government to make those choices for
them. Not only would this trigger a lot
of disruption, it would also lead to
sharp increases in taxes to fund this,
roughly, $30 trillion pipedream.
Last month, Speaker PELOSI man-
aged to take this debate on healthcare
to the next level. It seems like control-
ling people’s healthcare alone isn’t
enough. Now they want to run the drug
industry too. Forget about choice. For-
get about competition. Forget about
innovation. One of the things that has
characterized the American healthcare
system is the lifesaving innovation of
drugs. The Democrats want to now
have the Federal Government deter-
mine what the formulary is, what
drugs are available to you. They want
to set the prices and ensure the bureau-
crats rather than families are at the
center of our healthcare system. They
are churning out partisan healthcare
bills, one after another, and taking
their party further and further to the
left with every move.
I would like to think, ultimately,
cooler heads will prevail in the Senate,
where we have been working on bipar-
tisan bills to bring down healthcare
costs. For example, the Senate’s Judi-
ciary, Finance, and HELP Committees
have each passed bipartisan packages
of bills to end surprise billing so as to

S6272 October 30, 2019
create more transparency when it
comes to pharmaceuticals and in-
creased competition, but that doesn’t
mean this side of the Capitol is im-
mune from some of the politics when it
comes to our healthcare system.
Rather than following the Speaker’s
lead in introducing partisan bills, the
Democratic leader in the Senate has
taken a different tack, that of blocking
bipartisan consensus bills. For exam-
ple, there is a bill I introduced earlier
this year with our colleague from Con-
necticut, Senator BLUMENTHAL, to
bring down skyrocketing drug prices.
Senator BLUMENTHAL is a Democrat,
and I am a Republican, but contrary to
what you may see in the media, that
doesn’t mean we can’t talk to each
other or work together in the best in-
terests of our constituents.
Because Senator BLUMENTHAL and I
both sit on the Committee on the Judi-
ciary, we have been looking at the
price hikes that have been caused by
people who game the patent system,
specifically something called patent
thicketing. Some drugmakers build a
web of patents that is so intricate it is
virtually impossible for competition to
go to market even when the patent on
the underlying drug has expired or will
expire soon. They use these so-called
patent thickets to hold competitors at
bay and keep prices high for as long as
possible.
This is something Senator
BLUMENTHAL and I are trying to stop
through our bill, the Affordable Pre-
scriptions for Patients Act. This legis-
lation would disarm those patent
thickets and streamline litigation by
limiting the number of patents compa-
nies can use so competition can go to
market sooner.
This legislation passed the Senate’s
Judiciary Committee in June without
having a single member on either side
of the aisle vote against it. It was
unanimous, which is something that
doesn’t happen all that often in the
Committee on the Judiciary. In the
past, something with this level of sup-
port would have quickly sailed through
the full Senate but not today, not on
the minority leader’s watch. According
to a report in POLITICO, the minority
leader is blocking this bipartisan bill.
With the House Democrats’ obsession
of impeaching the President and, ap-
parently, their interest in accom-
plishing nothing else, the odds of bipar-
tisan legislation getting done around
here are getting slimmer and slimmer
each day. Rather than seizing the op-
portunity to pass a bill that will pro-
vide relief to the folks we represent
who struggle with the high costs of
prescriptions, it is politics 24/7. I am
disappointed in our colleagues’ single-
minded obsession with undoing the 2016
election and removing the President
from office. One of the casualties of
that, though, is the prevention of our
being able to pass even bipartisan bills
to help the American people, the peo-
ple we represent.
I ask here, publicly today, for the mi-
nority leader to reconsider his decision
of blocking this bipartisan piece of leg-
islation.
I am afraid the vote our Democratic
colleagues have just forced us to take
this afternoon shows just how far they
are willing to go to prove a point, even
when the point is not well made, which
leaves me with little optimism that the
minority leader will have a change of
heart.
As we have heard, the Affordable
Care Act has what is known as State
innovation waivers. That is part of
what we voted on just a moment ago.
It is important to reiterate that these
innovation waivers, which were a part
of the Affordable Care Act, enable
States to waive some of the law’s bur-
densome requirements in pursuit of
finding alternative means of coverage.
States can apply for these waivers to
change how insurance subsidies are
used, for example, and select a com-
bination that better fits their States’
and their citizens’ needs. What works
in a State as big as mine, with 28 mil-
lion citizens, isn’t, maybe, going to
work in the same way as in a smaller
State—North Dakota or Delaware.
Washington bureaucrats shouldn’t be
able to decide what best suits the needs
of my constituents in Texas. That is
why these waivers, which are part of
the Affordable Care Act, are so impor-
tant and why, last year, the adminis-
tration gave the States more flexi-
bility to tailor their insurance plans to
suit their constituents’ needs. This
does not mean, as we have heard, that
the States have an entirely free hand.
It just gives them more flexibility to
use Federal dollars where they are
needed most. Unfortunately, our Demo-
cratic colleagues are opposed to these
expanded innovation options.
They claim they forced this vote to
repeal the rule because it puts pa-
tients’ coverage for preexisting condi-
tions at risk, but that is not true. Sec-
tion No. 1332 does not allow States to
waive ObamaCare’s preexisting condi-
tions’ coverage. In fact, these waivers
give States the ability to provide en-
hanced support for those with pre-
existing conditions and high healthcare
costs. So far, 13 States have been ap-
proved for these waivers.
It is worth noting on this chart the
1332 waivers that have been issued this
year. Colorado has seen a reduction in
premiums by 16 percent; Delaware by
13 percent; Montana by 8 percent;
North Dakota by a whopping 20 per-
cent; and Rhode Island by 6 percent.
So with preexisting conditions cov-
ered, and with premiums actually
going down, what is there to object to?
Well, our Democratic colleagues are
simply waging a war against a problem
that does not exist, but I guess if you
say it often enough and loudly enough,
some people, somewhere, may just be-
lieve that coverage of preexisting con-
ditions is somehow a partisan issue. It
is not. They are grasping at straws as
their party unfortunately has gone fur-
ther and further to the left on
healthcare.
Well, 10 of the 13 States that received
waivers are represented by at least one
Democrat in the Senate. Why would
you vote for a repeal of a rule con-
sistent with existing law that would
lower premiums for your constituents
which would require coverage for pre-
existing conditions unless it is your
good sense overcome by perhaps poli-
tics?
Our Democratic friends make it seem
like coverage of preexisting conditions
is a partisan issue when it is not. We
all agree that patients with preexisting
conditions should receive health cov-
erage, period.
Earlier this year, I cosponsored a bill
introduced by our friend, the Senator
from North Carolina, Mr. TILLIS, called
the PROTECT Act, which would reaf-
firm our commitment that no Amer-
ican will ever be denied health cov-
erage due to a preexisting condition.
We believe that coverage for pre-
existing conditions shouldn’t hang in
the balance of a court decision. It
would finally codify what every Mem-
ber of this body says they agree with:
That all Americans deserve access to
health coverage, specifically to cover
preexisting conditions.
All this rule by the Trump adminis-
tration does is provide the States with
the flexibility to cater to their citi-
zens’ healthcare needs, and there sim-
ply was no reason to overturn it, and
we did not.
So I would encourage our colleagues
to stop daydreaming about pie in the
sky ideas like Medicare for All—simply
unaffordable, absolutely unworkable—
or a government-run pharmaceutical
industry where the government sets
the prices and says what drugs you or
your family can get access to.
Quit trying to fight the President at
every turn and every step he wants to
make. Try to find places where we can
work together, and let’s do that by
moving bipartisan legislation that will
lower out-of-pocket costs for drugs and
improve people’s quality of life and
standard of living.
Mr. President, I yield the floor.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I lis-
tened carefully to the Senator from
Texas, my colleague—and we have
worked together and will continue to.
For the record, there is something that
I think needs to be mentioned.
It was a year ago, maybe even longer,
that the attorney general from his
State of Texas initiated a lawsuit with
more than a dozen Republican attor-
neys general to eliminate the Afford-
able Care Act—all of it, the protection
when it came to preexisting conditions,
lifetime limits, allowing members of
the family to keep their children on
their policy until they reach the age of
26.
These States attorneys general,
starting with his State of Texas, said:
Get rid of all of it. Eliminate it. And
then President Trump said: We will
join in the lawsuit. Let’s eliminate it
completely.
So when I hear these pleas on the
floor that we are all for the principles

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6273
October 30, 2019
in the Affordable Care Act, not a single
Republican Senator voted for it, and
now there is an effort by the attorneys
general and the Trump administration
to do away with it.
Is it because they have a better idea?
No. I am sure you remember that mo-
ment not long ago when our departed
colleague, John McCain, came to the
well of the Senate and was the deciding
vote to save the Affordable Care Act.
The point he made is still valid. The
Republicans have no alternative. I
want to make sure the Affordable Care
Act is better. There are some parts of
it that need to be improved, but to
eliminate it as this lawsuit would from
the Trump administration? That is a
step backwards.
There are two other points that I
would like to make. When it comes to
our current healthcare system, it has
many positive things: wonderful doc-
tors and hospitals, amazing technology
and medicine.
But there are also some built-in flaws
in the system. Let me give an example,
one simple story. I met a woman the
other day. Her sister is an OB/GYN.
She got married, pregnant, about to
have twins, couldn’t be happier, but
the babies came early. And so this doc-
tor went to the hospital to deliver her
babies, her twins, and they needed to
be put in the neonatal intensive care
unit of the hospital, which of course
she did.
Good news. Three or four weeks
later, they were ready to come home.
They came home, and of course, every-
one was happy to receive them. But
they weren’t happy to receive the bill
for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
What was it for? It turns out that, at
the hospital, the doctor was in network
for the woman who was delivering the
baby. The hospital was in the network
for delivering the baby. But the NICU
was a separate entity that even this
doctor didn’t know it wasn’t in net-
work.
Her babies went to this lifesaving in-
tensive care unit in the hospital, and
she received a bill for hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars—a surprise bill. Is that
right? Of course, it is not. And here is
a professional, a medical professional,
who frankly could not ask all the right
questions, obviously, and became a vic-
tim of the system.
Let me tell you one other story,
when we talk about the current state
of the cost of medicine. I go to Rock-
ford, IL, and I meet a young woman,
and she introduces me to her mother.
Her mother is a waitress, a hard-work-
ing lady, never took a day off in her
life. But she did have some health in-
surance, and her health insurance cov-
ered her daughter until her daughter
reached the age of 26, and then her
daughter was on her own.
The problem was her daughter is dia-
betic, and her mother understood that
now the cost of insulin, which had been
covered by the family health insur-
ance, was an individual personal bur-
den for her daughter to pay, and the
cost of insulin had gone up dramati-
cally during the girl’s young life.
In the last dozen years or so, the cost
of insulin has gone from $39 for a vial—
one of the most commonly used types
of insulin called Humalog made by Eli
Lilly—from $39 a vial to $329. The
mother was in a panic. Her daughter
was working part-time and just getting
started, still suffering from diabetes.
Her mother was afraid she would not be
able to afford the insulin, so her moth-
er, a waitress, was taking her money
and putting it aside to buy vials of in-
sulin, so if her daughter started to run
short, she would be able to provide her
with the insulin.
What is the cost of that same product
in Canada? $39—$329 in the United
States; $39 in Canada. What is the dif-
ference? It is the same drug made by
the same company in the United
States. The difference is the govern-
ment of Canada stepped up and said:
We are not going to let you do this. We
are not going to let you run the cost of
insulin to the high heavens at the ex-
pense of people who live in Canada.
And Eli Lilly said: We will play by
your rules, if that is what the Canadian
Government says.
So when I hear Senators, like my
friend from Texas, get up and talk
about this terrible invasion of govern-
ment into our rights, that lady, that
mother in Rockford would certainly
like to have her government—our gov-
ernment—step up and give her a chance
to have affordable insulin so she could
have peace of mind for her daughter. It
is not too much to ask.
THE RELIEF ACT
Mr. President, the reason I came to
the floor is because I wanted to respond
to my friend—because it is a critical
topic—but the reason I came to the
floor is to discuss an issue which is not
uniquely American, but is truly Amer-
ican.
For 528 years now in this place called
America, we have immigrants coming
to the shores of our Nation. Starting
and following Christopher Columbus—
if you buy that side of the story, and I
do—we have had millions come to our
shores and they have become part of
America. With the exception of Native
Americans and indigenous people, they
have come from every corner of this
earth to be part of what we call the
United States.
You would think, with that history,
that we would have a pretty clear idea
of what our policy should be when it
comes to immigration. Sadly, you are
wrong. We have the most broken immi-
gration system imaginable. I have
studied it for years and continue to. It
is almost impossible to understand all
of the twists and turns in our immigra-
tion system.
Seven years ago, there were eight of
us—four Democrats and four Repub-
licans in the Senate—with the leader-
ship of Senator McCain, Senator SCHU-
MER, and many others, who came to-
gether and rewrote the entire immigra-
tion code, the entire immigration body
of law. It took us months of meeting
every single night, hammering out
compromises, agreeing to provisions.
Then we went to the Judiciary Com-
mittee, and hundreds of amendments
were offered. Senator Sessions of Ala-
bama, I think he offered dozens by him-
self. He wasn’t too happy with the bill.
But we went through that lengthy
process, came to the floor of the Sen-
ate, and faced even more amendments.
At the end of the day, though, it
passed. I believe it was 68 votes on the
floor of the Senate. We passed com-
prehensive immigration reform, sent it
to the House of Representatives, and
unfortunately, the Republican leader-
ship would not even consider it. They
didn’t even bring it up for a debate or
for an amendment.
So we are stuck today with a broken
system, and we are also stuck with a
system that is rife with politics. I
would say, and I think no one would
contradict us, no President before Don-
ald Trump has really made such an
issue of immigration—no one.
It has been an issue in the past, but
this President, from the beginning of
his campaign until the current time,
has hammered away at immigration
constantly, calling those that came
from Mexico murders and rapists and
so many other things that he has
done—I can go through the long litany
of things that have happened. It is
pretty clear that, when it comes to the
policy of immigration, that this ad-
ministration has fallen down and falls
short when it comes to immigration.
Today, I want to address one aspect
of this. I am the ranking Democrat on
the Immigration Subcommittee. Coin-
cidentally, the chairman of that Sub-
committee in Judiciary is the gen-
tleman from Texas, Mr. CORNYN, who
just left the floor.
So far this year, 10 months into this
year, our Subcommittee on Immigra-
tion, despite all the problems, all of the
challenges, has had one hearing—one
hearing. It is a good thing that we are
not paid for the work that we do be-
cause, frankly, we have done little or
nothing.
The Senate Judiciary Committee in
the same period of time has only voted
on one immigration bill. The Repub-
lican majority limited debate to only 1
hour and didn’t allow a single amend-
ment to be offered. It is hardly an am-
bitious effort to make a body of law
better.
It is time for the Immigration Sub-
committee to go back to work. Today,
I sent a letter—joined by every Demo-
crat on the Judiciary Committee—ask-
ing the Republican Chairman of the
Immigration Subcommittee, the gen-
tleman from Texas, to hold a hearing
on one serious problem in our immigra-
tion system: the green-card backlog.
In our broken immigration system,
there are not nearly enough immigrant
visas—legal visas known as green
cards—available each year. As a result,
many of the immigrants to this coun-
try are stuck in crippling backlogs for
years, sometimes decades.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6274 October 30, 2019
Close to 5 million future Americans
are in line waiting for green cards.
Many are living and working in the
United States on temporary visas,
while many are waiting abroad, sepa-
rated from their families who are liv-
ing in the United States.
Under current law, only 226,000 fam-
ily green cards and 140,000 employment
green cards are available each year.
Children and spouses of lawful perma-
nent residents count against these
caps, which further limits the avail-
ability of green cards.
The backlogs are really hard on fami-
lies who are caught in immigration
limbo. For example, children in many
of these families ‘‘age out’’ because
they are no longer under the age of 21
by the time the green cards are avail-
able.
That is why I have asked the Senator
from Texas, Mr. CORNYN, to hold a
hearing on this issue to consider sev-
eral pending bills dealing with this
green card backlog. I have asked him
repeatedly. I have asked Senator GRA-
HAM, and I have asked Senator LEE,
who is engaged in this debate. This will
help the Senate to understand the im-
pact of each of these proposals before
us, to try to reach an agreement.
That is how the Senate, incidentally,
is supposed to work, where the com-
mittees gather, bring in witnesses,
have an open debate, agree on a bill,
move it forward to the floor, open it to
debate on the floor. In 2013, as I men-
tioned, I was part of a bipartisan group
that showed it can work. We need to
show it again. Then, our bill went
through extensive hearings and debate.
Unfortunately, the senior Senator
from Utah, my friend, Mr. LEE, has
tried to avoid regular order on this
question. He does not want it to go to
committee. I hope he will reconsider.
He has come to the floor several times
to attempt to pass his legislation, S.
386, without any debate or chance to
offer any amendments. Because he has
chosen this approach, I have come to
the floor today to speak about his leg-
islation and mine.
My concern with Senator LEE’s bill is
simple. The solution to the green-card
backlog is obvious: Increase the num-
ber of green cards. But S. 386, Senator
LEE’s bill, includes no additional green
cards. In fact, it has carve-outs for spe-
cial interests—which are not in the
original version of the bill that passed
by the House—and that will cut the
number of green cards that are avail-
able to reduce the backlog. Without
any additional green cards, S. 386 will
not eliminate the backlogs for the im-
migrants, particularly those from
India—and there is a large number,
over half a million, the nationality
with the most people in the employ-
ment backlog. It will dramatically in-
crease backlogs for the rest of the
world if we go by Senator LEE’s bill.
Ira Kurzban is one of the Nation’s ex-
perts on immigration law. He took a
look at Senator LEE’s bill, and he said
the backlogs will be longer and larger
because of it. In fact, over 165,000 In-
dian immigrants currently in line for
these visas will still be waiting 10 years
from now.
Mr. Kurzban has also made it clear
that the Lee bill puts some Indian im-
migrants to the front of the line—be-
cause they have been waiting the long-
est—at the expense of every other
country.
From 2023 until well into 2030, there will be
zero EB–22 visas for the rest of the world.
None for China, South Korea, Philippines,
Britain, Canada, Mexico, every country in
the EU and all of Africa. Zero. It would
choke off green cards for every profession
that isn’t IT—healthcare, medical research,
basic science, all kinds of engineering; chem-
ists, physicists.
That is why dozens of national orga-
nizations representing many immi-
grant communities oppose the bill in-
troduced by Senator LEE. Groups rep-
resenting Arabs, Africans, Asians, Ca-
nadians, Chinese, Greeks, the Irish,
Italians, Koreans, South Asians, and
many, many more have come out in op-
position to the Lee bill. More than 20 of
these groups sent a letter in opposi-
tion.
In light of this attempt to pass the
Lee bill and the problems it has run
into, I am offering an alternative to
this legislation. My alternative is basic
and straightforward. It would elimi-
nate the green card backlog and treat
all immigrants fairly.
The RELIEF Act, which I introduced
with Senator PAT LEAHY and Senator
MAZIE HIRONO, will treat all immi-
grants fairly by eliminating immigra-
tion visa backlogs. The RELIEF bill is
based on the same comprehensive im-
migration bill I described earlier. It
would lift green card country caps, but,
unlike S. 386, the RELIEF Act would
increase the number of green cards to
clear the backlogs for all immigrants
waiting in line for green cards within 5
years. Compare that to S. 386, the Lee
bill, where more than 165,000 Indian im-
migrants currently in line will still be
waiting 10 years from now.
The RELIEF Act will also keep
American families together by treating
children and spouses of legal perma-
nent residents as immediate relatives,
just as the children and spouses of citi-
zens are, so they won’t count against
the green card cap. My bill would pro-
tect aging-out children who qualify for
legal permanent resident status based
on a parent’s immigration status.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2603
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Judiciary Committee be
discharged of S. 2603, the RELIEF Act,
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration; further, that the
bill be considered read a third time and
passed and the motion to reconsider be
considered made and laid upon the
time with no intervening action or de-
bate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from South Dakota.
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the legis-
lation to which the Senator from Illi-
nois has referred, Senator LEE’s bill—
Senator LEE is not able to be here to
object, so on his behalf, I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Illinois.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am
sorry for this objection. I thank the
Senator from South Dakota for coming
to the floor on behalf of the Senator
from Utah. I have been in communica-
tion with the Senator from Utah. I
hope he will join me in asking for a
hearing. This is an issue which lit-
erally affects hundreds of thousands of
people living in this country, many of
whom have been here for years and dec-
ades. Practicing physicians in my
hometown of Springfield are affected
by this debate. They want to know
what their future will be and the future
of their children.
I am trying to find a reasonable way
to work out a compromise on this, and
I stand ready to do so. I hope Senator
LEE will join me in asking Senators
GRAHAM and CORNYN to have a hearing
before the Judiciary Committee. I want
to extend this invitation to Senator
LEE to join the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee Democrats who signed a letter
with me today requesting this hearing.
I am happy to sit down and discuss
this issue with the senior Senator from
Utah or any other Senator. If we work
together in good faith, I believe we can
reach a bipartisan agreement on legis-
lation that can pass both Chambers
and be signed into law.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
OPIOID EPIDEMIC
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, just over
a year ago, President Trump signed
into law the most comprehensive and
sweeping opioid response package in
the Nation’s history, a piece of legisla-
tion that passed this body with over-
whelming bipartisan support—a rarity
in gridlocked Washington. The reason
we came together was simple: Opioid
abuse is tearing apart families, strain-
ing our law enforcement and emer-
gency services, and engulfing our com-
munities. Young mothers with precious
babies and young people in the prime of
their lives are focused on fentanyl
rather than finding their path toward
success.
This crippling epidemic has touched
the lives of Iowans from all walks of
life and from all areas of our State. We
have seen the harrowing statistics and
the ongoing struggles that many of our
loved ones face. In Iowa, we also strug-
gle with an ongoing meth epidemic
that further threatens our commu-
nities. In just one of many statistics,
the number of children put into foster

care in the United States due to paren-
tal drug use nearly doubled from 2000
to 2017.
I have heard so many heartbreaking
stories from families who have a loved
one battling addiction.
A mom from Polk County shared
with me her son’s 7-year battle with
addiction and how the vicious disease
affects all levels of society, including
our friends, our neighbors, and in her
case, her family. She concluded by
pleading with Congress to act to end,
in her words, ‘‘this horrific situation
and serious threat to our nation’s fu-
ture.’’ Families like this are desperate
for their loved ones to reach recovery
and good health before their story ends
in tragedy. As is sometimes quoted,
‘‘Addiction is a family disease. One
person may use, but the whole family
suffers.’’
It is these heartbreaking stories that
propelled me and my colleagues to
take action. This bipartisan package
named the ‘‘SUPPORT Act’’ expanded
treatment and recovery options for
opioid addiction, created new tools for
prevention and enforcement, supported
safe disposal of opioids, strengthened
first responders’ training, and provided
for the safe disposal of unused drugs. It
has produced real results for Iowans
and for folks all across the country.
Just last week, I had the chance to
join the First Lady of the United
States, Melania Trump, Secretary of
Health and Human Services Alex Azar,
and a number of other administration
officials to discuss the progress made
on opioid abuse, including efforts to re-
duce the number of women using
opioids during pregnancy.
This President and this Republican-
led Senate are tackling the opioid cri-
sis in a meaningful and thoughtful
way, and I couldn’t be prouder to be as-
sociated with this work. In Iowa alone,
for instance, we have seen the number
of deaths from opioids decrease by 19
percent. In September, the administra-
tion announced $932 million in awards
for State opioid response grant fund-
ing, including over $11 million for Iowa.
This past Saturday, Iowans from
across the State participated in an-
other National Take Back Day to raise
awareness and encourage the safe dis-
posal of unused prescription drugs.
Earlier this year, in April, when we had
another Take Back Day, in my home
State of Iowa, 88 law enforcement offi-
cers worked at 135 collection sites
throughout the State and collected
11,680 pounds of unused prescription
drugs. More than 135,255 pounds of un-
used drugs have been collected in Iowa
since the beginning of the drug take
back program.
I am humbled to say that my bipar-
tisan Access to Increased Drug Dis-
posal Act, which was part of the pack-
age we passed last year, led directly to
resources being awarded in Iowa for
events like these.
We should be encouraged by the im-
pact the SUPPORT Act, combined with
the Trump administration’s efforts,
have made in the lives of Iowans in just
1 year.
As we continue in our fight, I feel
hopeful and determined—hopeful that
we can help Americans rise above the
chains of addiction and determined all
the more to keep making progress on
behalf of families across this country.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
PERDUE). The Senator from Ohio.
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I wish
to thank my colleague from Iowa for
her comments and also for her orga-
nizing this event this afternoon. This is
an opportunity for us to talk not only
about some of the things we have done
in the U.S. Congress that are positive
in terms of addressing the largest drug
crisis we have ever faced in our coun-
try but also about what we need to do
going forward and how we need to keep
our eye on the ball to be sure that we
don’t see more addiction coming, that
we don’t see some of these new dan-
gers—like crystal meth and other
drugs—coming up.
Again, I thank my colleague from
Iowa. Iowa has been hard-hit; so has
Ohio. In fact, in 2017, our opioid over-
dose rate was about three times the na-
tional average. We have, unfortu-
nately, been in the top five in terms of
overdose deaths for most of the last 10
years. We have had nearly a dozen
Ohioans dying from these dangerous
drugs every single day. This has now
surpassed car accidents as the No. 1
cause of death in my home State of
Ohio.
What has happened is, since 2017,
with a lot of work from a lot of people
on the ground, with some help from
Washington—about $4 billion in new
funding that this body has approved
and taken the lead on—we have begun
to make progress.
Last year, in 2018, Ohio had a 22-per-
cent reduction in overdose deaths. This
leads the country in reductions, and we
are proud of that because of the lives
that have been saved. But we also real-
ize that we came from such a high
mark, high watermark, that it is im-
portant for us to keep the pressure on
to continue to make progress.
What has happened in Ohio is what is
happening around the country, which
is the SUPPORT Act, which was signed
into law by the President just about 1
year ago, and other legislation, like
the Comprehensive Addiction and Re-
covery Act—the CARA legislation—and
also the State Opioid Response grants,
have started to work.
I see the Senator from Missouri is on
the floor today. What they have done
in the Appropriations Committee to
fund these projects is making a huge
difference back home. I have spent a
lot of my time working with the com-
munity organizations, talking to ad-
dicts and recovering addicts. I have
talked to a couple thousand in the last
couple of years alone. I will tell you, it
is working. What is working are more
innovative programs back home to
close some of these gaps.
Recently, I had the opportunity to go
out with the RREACT team in Colum-
bus, OH. They are being funded with a
grant of about $800,000 from the Com-
prehensive Addiction and Recovery
Act, the CARA legislation. Again, this
has been funded by the Appropriations
Committee, actually, at above its au-
thorized level.
It is working. They are closing an ob-
vious gap, which was that people were
overdosing, getting Narcan. Our brave
first responders were saving their lives,
and then those people were going back
to the community they were from—
back to the same family or the same
group of friends—and, unfortunately,
with the addiction not having been ad-
dressed, they were overdosing again
and, sometimes, again and again and
again.
Often, these first responders—the
firefighters back home—will tell you:
We were saving the same person time
and again. Some of that is still hap-
pening, but what the RREACT team
does when there is an overdose and
when Narcan is supplied—this miracle
drug to reverse the effects of the over-
dose—then there is followup. Of course,
we should have done it years ago, but
we are now doing it. I am proud to say,
in my home town of Cincinnati, OH,
Colerain Township, much of this was
started, but now it is spreading around
the country.
The Columbus RREACT team is one
of the best. They go out with fire-
fighters, EMS personnel, with law en-
forcement, plainclothes, with social
workers, with treatment providers, to
the family, to the home—and I have
gone out with them; I have gone to the
homes and met with these addicts—and
they say: Look, we are here to help. We
are not here to arrest you, but we are
here to say that you need to get into
treatment.
Unbelievably—and a lot of people are
skeptical of this. Here is an addict;
why would they come forward? But in
about 80 percent of the cases, in terms
of the RREACT team, these individuals
say: Do you know what? OK, I will try
it.
That is the first step. That is the
critical first step—to get into treat-
ment and then longer term recovery
and begin to turn that person’s life
around, as well as that person’s family
and that person’s community because
it has devastated all of the above.
This is what is happening with the
Federal legislation funding innovative
projects back home to close these gaps
and to make a difference. I am very ap-
preciative of what our team has done
here—Republicans and Democrats
alike.
In the more recent legislation that
was just passed, the SUPPORT Act, we
also included something that focuses
exclusively on fentanyl. This is really
important. It is called the STOP Act.
In my subcommittee, we did an 18-
month investigation of this. We spent a
lot of time on it. We worked hard to
make it bipartisan but also to be sure

S6276 October 30, 2019
it was something that would actually
work. We found out that fentanyl,
which is the worst of the drugs and the
most dangerous, is killing more people
than any other drug. Even today, with
our success on opioids, this synthetic
opioid is coming almost exclusively
from China, and at the time we passed
the legislation a couple of years ago, it
was almost exclusively coming through
our U.S. mail system—our U.S. mail
system. This deadly drug was coming
into post office boxes and to people’s
homes.
What we said to the post office was:
You have to put some screening in
place, much like FedEx does or DHS
does or DHL or other private sector en-
tities. Guess what. They are starting to
do that, and it is making a big dif-
ference. They are now requiring ad-
vance electronic data from these pack-
ages, showing where they are from,
where they are going, what is in them.
This allows law enforcement to target
those packages and to stop some of this
fentanyl coming in.
Unfortunately, the post office is not
doing all it should do. Under the legis-
lation, they are supposed to have 100
percent of packages from China, as an
example, being flagged, being screened,
and they are not.
Right now, we think they are identi-
fying from China about 88 percent of
the packages. It is not 100 percent yet.
Let’s get to 100 percent.
We have also found that the Postal
Service, based on a 2019 audit this year
by the inspector general, identified and
pulled about 88 percent of the packages
from China that were flagged. That
leaves, of course, many packages that
are not being flagged. So over 10 per-
cent of these packages, the post office
can’t even find.
Let’s do better. We can do better. It
is critical that we continue to hold the
post office accountable because this is
poison coming into our communities.
That is in this legislation.
One kilogram of this fentanyl is pow-
erful enough to kill about one-half mil-
lion people. That is how powerful this
is. It is a true life-and-death issue.
We have introduced new legislation
in Congress called the FIGHT Fentanyl
Act in the last week. Why? Because,
otherwise, fentanyl, which is currently
listed as a substance on schedule I—a
schedule I drug and therefore illegal—
is going to come off that list in Feb-
ruary of next year. We can’t let that
happen, of course. Let’s not do a short-
term extension. Let’s put fentanyl on
as a scheduled drug permanently.
I see more of my colleagues have
come to talk about this issue.
My point, I guess, is very simple. We
have done some great things in this
body to help our governments back
home at our State and local levels and
the nonprofits and people in the
trenches who are doing the hard work.
Let’s keep it up. Let’s be a better part-
ner. Let’s continue to provide support
through the Comprehensive Addiction
and Recovery Act, through the Opioid
Response grants, through the STOP
Act, and through other things to be
able to give folks back home the tools
they need to push back against this
scourge, against this addiction that is
devastating our families, our commu-
nities. Now we see, with the opioid
progress having been made, other drugs
coming in—particularly, crystal
meth—directly from Mexico. So it is
not just about this; it is about being
flexible enough to be able to approach
that as well. We have new legislation
on meth that we should also be work-
ing on to provide that flexibility.
In the meantime, again, the Appro-
priations Committee is doing its work,
sending the funding that is making a
difference to save lives in our commu-
nities.
I yield back my time.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri.
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to
thank Senator PORTMAN for his com-
ments about what we have tried to do
to provide the money, but let me tell
you, having been involved in that part
of it, really, before we began to pass
legislation, nobody was more vigor-
ously active than Senator PORTMAN to
try to continue to point out the size of
this problem and that something had
to be done. He was out there talking
about how big a problem this was for
the country before other people were.
Thanks to Senator ERNST for bring-
ing this group together today to talk
about this critical issue as we figure
out better ways to deal with this ter-
rible scourge of addiction and activity
that preys on people who have become
addicted.
More than 47,000 lives were lost due
to opioids in the United States in
2017—47,000 people. More people died of
opioid overdoses than died in car acci-
dents. The No. 1 cause of accidental
deaths changed dramatically in the
last handful of years. For everybody
who died, there were hundreds of oth-
ers who were risking their lives by mis-
using prescription drugs or illegal
drugs or, even worse, illegal drugs that
they had no idea what was in them.
The fentanyl challenge is so big and
so dangerous. It seems to me it would
be a pretty poor business model to try
to have a drug so powerful, a product
so powerful, that there is a good
chance the person you are selling it to
will never be a customer again because
they are going to die from taking this
drug, often knowing it is an incredibly
dangerous moment to try to get on a
drug-induced high that defies anything
that has happened to them before. Of
course, once you cross that line, there
is no other line to cross because you
are no longer a customer. Your life is
gone. Your dependency on these drugs,
no matter how it began, whether it was
a high school cheerleading accident or
a car accident or a running accident or
a dental appointment—all kinds of
ways—and in past decades, people be-
lieved prescribing these opioids had no
danger of addiction and, boy, did we
find out that was wrong.
Now, 3.4 percent of our entire gross
domestic product—almost $700 billion—
was impacted and lost by the ongoing
opioid crisis in 2018. Every State has a
problem. Our State, Missouri, has a
problem. We have seen a steady in-
crease in synthetic opioid use over the
last several years. This seemed to be
moving from east to west, and I was
hoping that by the time it got to us we
would have more information, more
thinking about it. I think that actually
may have happened, but it is still bad.
We had a 40-percent increase in
fentanyl-related overdoses from 2016 to
2017.
Health and Human Services Sec-
retary Azar and I were in Kansas City
together at the Truman Medical Center
to talk about this epidemic—Truman
Medical, the No. 1 provider of uncom-
pensated care in our State. We went to
the neonatal area and saw babies who
had neonatal abstinence syndrome,
which is affecting a number newborns
now, and looked at how they were deal-
ing with newborns who were born ad-
dicted.
Truman doctors and leaders there, as
well as leaders in other area health
centers in Kansas City, talked to us
about how they were dealing with this.
We have learned, even in the context of
one urban area, that there is not nec-
essarily a one-size-fits-all way to deal
with this, which is why we have tried
to focus our money at the Federal level
on giving States the maximum flexi-
bility they could have, within their
State and in their State, to come up
with what worked in the communities
they were trying to work with.
We have provided the money. We
haven’t found every solution yet, but
we are on the way, I think, to doing
that. We have included flexibility for
the States to use in funding for treat-
ment, funding for prevention, funding
for recovery from opioids, and other
stimulants.
In Missouri, Federal funding in the
last year has treated 4,000 people who
wouldn’t have been treated otherwise.
Narcan is more and more available at
workplaces and other places.
There is simply more work to do. We
need to continue our focus on targeting
resources toward opioid addiction but
also toward behavioral health issues. I
have said a number of times as we have
dealt with this that if you don’t have a
behavioral health problem before you
are addicted, you absolutely will have
one after you are addicted.
One of the things we have found to be
a big advantage in our State is that we
had the good fortune to be part of this
eight-State pilot program in which, in
a number of locations in our State, re-
garding excellence in mental health,
we are treating behavioral health,
mental health, as we would treat any
other health problem. That means you
would treat it as long as it needs to be
treated. There is no 14-day limit or 28-
day limit. You can be treated just as
you would for a kidney problem or an-
other cancer problem or any other

problem, as long as you need it. We are
finding great success in combining not
only the medicated assisted therapy
with getting off opioids but also the
ability to have that mental health
component as long as it needs to be
there.
We are hoping to continue to work on
the facts we have put together to de-
termine what happens when you treat
behavioral health issues like all other
health issues, to determine other
healthcare costs that people have. We
are hoping to extend that pilot another
2 years, not to make it a permanent
Federal responsibility but to be sure
that States and communities in the fu-
ture will have the level of evidence
they need to look at, that there will be
enough evidence compiled to show
what really happens because everybody
understands that treating mental
health like all other health is the right
thing to do.
I think these pilot projects are com-
piling the evidence to show you that
not only is it the right thing to do, but
actually it is the financially respon-
sible thing to do as well.
Attacking this problem from all lev-
els is critical. We are way beyond
where we were 5 years ago. We are not
where we need to be yet. States are
trying things, sharing things that work
and sharing things that don’t work and
why they didn’t work in the commu-
nities that tried them. So we are going
to continue to move forward with this.
I know Senator CAPITO is going to
speak after me. She is also one of the
early advocates for doing something
about what she saw were significant
problems that had developed in her
State. I was grateful to have her advice
and her driving this discussion in the
way she did.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia.
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I think
it is very impactful for us to be dis-
cussing today a problem that has hit
all of our States.
Senator BLUNT, in his great work not
just on the Appropriations Committee
but in his State of Missouri, has been
very active. I think we all have. It is a
problem that knows no political bound-
aries.
Certainly, my State of West Virginia
has one of the deepest, strongest, and
toughest problem. We have the highest
rate of opioid-related deaths per cap-
ita. It is not something we wear proud-
ly, but it is something that has really
forced us to try many innovative
things and to try to be the leader in
the solutions.
That is a lot of what I am going to
talk about today because a lot of what
we have seen in the SUPPORT Act,
from all of our individual States, has
been incorporated into a national re-
sponse to what is an epidemic around
our country that is frightening, scary,
and, in my view, could almost lead us
to losing a generation. This powerful
reaction we have had to the three
pieces of legislation is absolutely crit-
ical.
We passed the SUPPORT Act. It was
signed into law a little bit over a year
ago. That was really as an add-on to
the Comprehensive Addiction and Re-
covery Act that we passed several
years before that, but as my part of
this discussion today, I want to share
the successes that have worked in our
State and how I think they have been
able to be incorporated around the
country.
After CARA, we realized that while
we did great with money for rehab fa-
cilities and helping our first responders
with Narcan and other more immediate
problems, there were other things we
didn’t focus on that we really needed to
focus on in order to have a comprehen-
sive solution, and that is the children—
the children who are impacted in a
home of addiction or exposure to addic-
tion and also the jobs that are being
lost because of it. So we went back to
the drawing board, and we came up
with the SUPPORT Act, which is land-
mark legislation where we are seeing
real results.
For instance, in my State of West
Virginia, the State opioid response
grants are the grants that really go to
every State in a formula fashion, where
you are supporting treatment centers,
drug courts, and other responses to the
addiction issue, but under the old rule,
the money was divided up according to
your population size. So I started talk-
ing with Senator SHAHEEN from New
Hampshire—a small State impacted
more critically, like our State of West
Virginia—and saying: Wait a minute.
Our smaller States are really not get-
ting enough in the State opioid re-
sponse grants to make an impact and
to be part of the solution. So we pushed
hard to change this funding so States
that are more acutely affected, that
have smaller populations, like Mon-
tana, West Virginia, and New Hamp-
shire, are able to get more funding so
we can attack the problem where it is
the deepest and the most acute.
It helps with our WVU Comprehen-
sive Opioid Addiction Treatment, the
COAT, Program, the model they have
put together at WVU for medication-
assisted treatment made. It helps with
our peer recovery coaches, and it has
also had a lot of impact on our children
and our families.
What we have also found, like every
State here, I am sure—in the State of
Arkansas, you probably have more kids
in foster care than you have had in the
past because of this issue. According to
our West Virginia Bureau of Children
and Families, approximately 82 percent
of the children who are in foster care
are there because of parents with sub-
stance abuse-related issues. That is 82
percent of our children, and we have
thousands more in foster care. It is di-
rectly attributable to this issue. It
doesn’t even mention all the grand-
parents and great-grandparents, in
some cases, who are raising children.
How do we tackle the ripple effects of
this issue? Well, you can create some-
thing that was also created in West
Virginia called the Martinsburg Initia-
tive. It is spearheaded by the Martins-
burg Police Department—a small city
very close to DC, the West Virginia
part that is close to DC—the Berkeley
County Schools, and Shepherd Univer-
sity. It is a partnership with the Boys
& Girls Club of the Eastern Panhandle.
This is based on a CDC study that
shows that when children have adverse
childhood experiences—called ACES—if
you can categorize children who have
adverse childhood experiences, if you
can identify those children and pay
special attention to them through
things like the Martinsburg Initiative,
you can maybe head off issues that
could come into their future.
So police officers come to the
schools. They mentor the children. I
met them at the Boys & Girls Club of
the Eastern Panhandle and talked
about the positive influence a police of-
ficer, combined with the schools, com-
bined with a college student, can have
on a young person’s life—and, in some
cases, the most trusted person in their
life—if they are subject to a home that
is filled with drug and opioid addiction.
We saw the success of this.
I joined with Senator DURBIN—again,
across the aisle—to ensure that the
SUPPORT Act created some of this. We
are now taking it the next step forward
to address these issues in the RISE
from Trauma Act, which would help us
to build the trauma-informed work-
force—we don’t have enough people
working in this area—and increase
those resources in our communities.
Senator BLUNT talked about how im-
portant it is to work with babies who
are born with exposure to drugs. This is
also a part of the solution that has
come from West Virginia, where the
baby is taken out of the hospital set-
ting to try to address the issues of that
first trauma in the first days of their
life, to try to wean them off of not just
the exposure to drugs but also to incor-
porate the family into this so they can
see what kind of pediatric recovery is
needed and what the long-term effects
might be.
Senator PORTMAN has been an incred-
ible leader, trying to get rid of the
fentanyl that comes in that is killing
people. Over half of the people who die,
die of a fentanyl overdose. He is trying
to work with China and to work with
the post office to get the tools to pre-
vent illegal fentanyl from entering this
country. We have had some success,
but it is still frustrating. There is too
much getting in.
I chair the Homeland Security Sub-
committee on Appropriations. This is a
big issue for our Border Patrol and our
ICE agents to be able to make sure we
are giving our post office the tools.
Another thing we did was we passed
the INTERDICT Act, which the Presi-
dent signed, which will help the CBP
and also the post office be able to de-
tect fentanyl. It comes in these little
packages because it is so very lethal.
A lot of what we have done is Federal
funding, but a lot of what we have done

is listen to what our local communities
are doing and listen to how they are
solving problem in States that are
highly affected.
One of our communities of Hun-
tington has really been a leader in this.
One of the most effective strategies
that Huntington has had—and Hun-
tington had the highest overdose rate
in our State—was to create these quick
response teams. This is when a person
comes into the emergency room with
an overdose and is discharged, they are
then contacted within 72 hours by a
quick response team from the commu-
nity. A plainclothes police officer, with
a health officer or a social worker, and,
in some cases, a faith-based respondent
comes in and says: Are you ready for
recovery? When you are ready for re-
covery, this is where you go. We are
your community. We want to help you.
We understand where you are. We un-
derstand your issues. We are your
neighbors, and we want to help you.
This has really already had a very
good effect in the city of Huntington,
in Cabell County, because the overdose
rate in that area has gone down 26 per-
cent since they instituted the quick re-
sponse team concept. So it is going
across the country, and part of that is
because it is in the SUPPORT Act.
I have hope for what we have done in
West Virginia, but there are way too
many people and families who are af-
fected by this. There are too many lost
lives, too much lost time, and too
much lost love, quite frankly. There
are parents of children who can’t sleep
at night. The only night they sleep is
when they know their child is incarcer-
ated because they don’t know if they
are going to wake up the next morning.
There is story after story of just trage-
dies.
We are all working together. I think
we have a long way to go. I think we
have hit on some good solutions. We
need to keep the ones that are work-
ing, and the ones that don’t work, send
them on down the road because we
know there is no one solution to this
very difficult problem.
I am going to continue to fight with
my colleagues here today for every sin-
gle person and all those folks whose
lives are touched by this crisis.
Do you know what? We are all
touched by it. If I ask for a show of
hands in a townhall meeting and say:
Who knows somebody who has been
touched by this crisis, it is almost
unanimous. Everybody raises their
hands.
We are going to emerge stronger. I
am optimistic, but this is a long fight.
I am really pleased to join with so
many of my colleagues in this fight.
I think my colleague from Arkansas,
who has worked hard on this as well, is
the next one up.
Thank you.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas.
Mr. BOOZMAN. Thank you, Mr.
President.
I say a special thanks to Senator
CAPITO and all she has done, not only
in this area but in so many things that
affect rural America, certainly, being
the cochair of the Rural Broadband
Caucus. The list goes on and on. We do
appreciate her leadership.
Our Nation’s opioid epidemic is, un-
fortunately, a subject we have spoken
about all too often here and in so many
other places. It does feel, however, that
the tone and tenor of our remarks re-
flect a much more hopeful outlook
than many of our previous discussions
have had. That is because we are mak-
ing progress in the fight.
Around this time last year, we came
together to overwhelmingly pass a
comprehensive legislative package that
was signed into law by President
Trump, Democrats and Republicans
working together.
There has been a noticeable dif-
ference as a result of this comprehen-
sive reform. Law enforcement is now
better equipped to stop illegal opioids
from reaching our communities, and
efforts are being stepped up at the bor-
der to cut off the influx of fentanyl
from China. More first responders have
been trained to administer naloxone,
which has prevented opioid overdoses
from claiming more lives in our com-
munities.
Most importantly, we have saved
lives by increasing access to mental
health and addiction treatment serv-
ices for those struggling to overcome
opioid dependence.
The treatment and recovery aspect of
our strategy is the key. Federal re-
sources are being deployed nationwide
to break the cycle of addiction.
These grants are invaluable for the
facilities that give those struggling
with addiction and their families new
hope in the fight against opioid abuse.
From what I have seen firsthand at
treatment facilities in Arkansas, these
efforts are indeed making a difference.
They are helping tremendously.
The impact of this national epidemic
has been felt acutely in the Natural
State. According to the CDC, Arkansas
had the second-highest prescribing rate
over recent years, enough for each Ar-
kansan to have one opioid prescription
in his or her name.
It has taken a conscious effort by the
State’s medical community to drive
those numbers down by 12 percent over
a 4-year period. Limiting the amount
of dangerous pain pills in circulation is
a very positive and much needed step,
but what about all the expired, unused,
and unnecessary medications already
in circulation?
That is where Arkansas Take Back
comes in. Arkansas Prescription Drug
Take Back Day events happen twice a
year at locations across the State.
These events are an opportunity for
Arkansans to safely dispose of unused
or expired medications with no ques-
tions asked. They also serve as an op-
portunity to further educate the public
on the opioid epidemic and the impor-
tance of proper disposal of medica-
tions.
The 18th Arkansas Take Back this
past weekend was another in a long
line of successful events. According to
Arkansas drug director Kirk Lane, over
27,000 pounds of pills were collected at
the nearly 200 event day locations and
the 200-plus permanent drop boxes
across the State.
These events are a heavy lift on the
part of many Arkansans. We greatly
appreciate the efforts of law enforce-
ment agencies across the State, as well
as their partners—Rotary clubs, pre-
vention resource centers, Arkansas De-
partment of Health, and so many oth-
ers that carry out Take Back Day
events.
The hard work to organize these op-
portunities to properly dispose of pre-
scription medications is certainly
worthwhile. Research has found that
the majority of opioid abusers get their
drugs from friends and family, often
lifting pills from a familiar medicine
cabinet. When you tally the results
from the previous events in the State,
Arkansas ranks third nationally in
pounds collected per capita through
Take Back. That means there are fewer
homes in Arkansas where unsecured
medications can get in the wrong
hands.
I thank my colleagues for sharing
similar success stories from events in
their States. It is important that we
highlight these programs. Anything we
can do to get these dangerous drugs out
of circulation certainly can help save
lives. It is also a valuable reminder
that we will all have a role to play in
the fight to end the opioid crisis. Pre-
scription Drug Take Back Day is an
easy way each one of us can certainly
do our part.
I yield the floor to my good friend
Senator HOEVEN, whose leadership is
also very important.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota.
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank
the Senator from Arkansas for his
work and also my other colleagues,
those who have already spoken and the
good Senator from Montana, who is
going to speak right after. This really
has been a bipartisan effort to make a
difference, and I appreciate all my col-
leagues who are here today and who
have done so much to advance this
work, as well as the Senator from Kan-
sas, who I believe will be speaking here
in just a minute.
I join my colleagues today to discuss
our Nation’s effort to battle the opioid
abuse epidemic that has taken far too
many lives and has affected commu-
nities both large and small. Our first
responders, law enforcement officers,
healthcare professionals, and medical
facilities are fighting this crisis on the
frontlines. That is why we worked to
advance a comprehensive approach
that assists these key players and em-
powers States and localities to combat
this public health emergency.
Last year, Congress passed and the
President signed into law bipartisan
legislation—the SUPPORT Act—to
help families and communities im-
pacted by addiction. This law supports

prevention, treatment, recovery, and
law enforcement efforts.
Additionally, the SUPPORT Act con-
tains language that I was able to co-
sponsor to prevent the sale and ship-
ment of illicit and dangerous drugs.
This aligns with the goals of my Illegal
Synthetic Drug Safety Act, which
closes a loophole that has enabled bad
actors to circumvent the law to dis-
tribute synthetic variations of drugs,
like the powerful drug fentanyl, by la-
beling the products as ‘‘not for human
consumption.’’ While these variations
are technically different, they hold the
same dangerous risks as the original
drug.
The law also includes the Synthetic
Tracking and Overdose Prevention Act,
or STOP Act—another measure I co-
sponsored that requires shipments
from foreign countries sent through
the U.S. Postal Service to provide elec-
tronic data. This enables CBP to better
target illegal substances like fentanyl
and prevent them from being shipped
into our country from places like
China and other countries.
These measures are important steps
in keeping deadly drugs like fentanyl
out of our communities; nevertheless,
there is more to do, and we continue
working to combat the opioid abuse
epidemic from all sides. Just this week,
I co-led a letter with Senator SHAHEEN
encouraging the FAA to work with air-
lines to get opioid overdose reversal
drugs like Naloxone included in the
airlines’ emergency medical kits.
As chairman of the Senate Ag-FDA
Appropriations Subcommittee, I
worked to secure $20 million in our fis-
cal 2020 funding legislation to support
telemedicine grants that will help
rural communities to combat opioid
abuse as well.
Additionally, as a member of the
Senate Appropriations Committee, I
have supported the good work of Sen-
ator BLUNT, the chair of the Labor-
HHS-Education Appropriations Sub-
committee, to provide strong support
for opioid abuse prevention, treatment,
and recovery initiatives through the
Department of Health and Human
Services. The Labor-HHS-Education
bill provides $3.9 billion for such ef-
forts, including $800 million for the Na-
tional Institutes of Health to develop
pain management alternatives to
opioids, as well as to study opioid ad-
diction, and $200 million to support the
great work done by our community
health centers, to enable them to ex-
pand prevention and treatment serv-
ices and provide access to opioid over-
dose-reversal drugs.
Also, these bills include language I
helped author that places a focus on
addressing the challenges facing rural
communities struggling with this on-
going crisis. The bill gives States
greater flexibility in how they can use
opioid abuse funds, including allowing
some resources to be used to address
stimulants like meth, which remains a
substance of high concern in many of
our rural States, including my own.
We need to move forward with the
Labor-HHS appropriations bill and the
other full-year funding bills, including
the Defense appropriations bill, which I
believe we will be voting on this week,
because they are vital to our national
security and provide certainty for our
military and our servicemembers.
Passing these full-year appropria-
tions bills will ensure that we fund im-
portant priorities, from national secu-
rity to vital support for our ag pro-
ducers, to combatting the opioid abuse
epidemic we are talking about here
today.
We worked hard to pass the SUP-
PORT Act to provide our healthcare
providers, first responders, and law en-
forcement with the tools to prevent
drug abuse, treat those suffering from
addiction, and assist those in recovery.
While progress is being made, we
need to continue working together to
advance full-year funding bills to keep
moving the ball forward in the fight
against opioid abuse. We can combat
the epidemic, stem its tide, and save
lives.
I again want to commend my col-
leagues and will defer to my colleagues
from Montana and Kansas.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana.
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, just over
a year ago, President Trump signed
into law a major bipartisan bill, the
SUPPORT Act, to help combat the
opioid and drug epidemic that is dev-
astating this country. I call that a very
good first step in this long fight, and
now we must continue working to do
even more.
Drug overdoses are now the leading
cause of death for those under age 50 in
the United States. Our country is in
the middle of a major opioid and meth
crisis, and the sad reality is, this epi-
demic isn’t slowing down anytime
soon. It has been said that meth is the
next wave of the opioid crisis.
Sadly, in my home State of Montana,
that wave is already reality. Meth is
destroying Montana families and com-
munities. As I travel across Montana, I
hear far too many heartbreaking sto-
ries of addiction and tragedy. From
Great Falls to Wibaux, to the Flathead
and across Indian Country, the stories
are all too real.
We need to do more to put an end to
the tragic stories we are seeing in the
news—no more stories of babies being
born addicted to meth; no more stories
of meth breaking up families; no more
stories of babies being left in the for-
est—literally left in the forest—be-
cause their parents were high on meth.
These stories are real, and their im-
pacts are real.
Montana’s meth crisis is claiming
lives, breaking up families, and leaving
our foster care systems overcrowded
and sometimes overloaded. It is leading
to a significant rise in violent crime. In
fact, from 2011 to 2017, there was a 415-
percent increase in meth cases in Mon-
tana, with meth-related deaths rising
375 percent during those same years.
In Montana, the meth crisis is dis-
proportionately impacting Native
American Tribes. Enough is enough.
That is why I fought to include my leg-
islation, the Mitigating METH Act,
which strengthens Indian Tribes’ abil-
ity to combat drug use, in the SUP-
PORT Act that was signed into law
just last year.
That historic and comprehensive leg-
islation was a great first step, but
there is a lot more work that needs to
be done, and tangible things can be
done.
In Montana—we are a northern bor-
der State, but we have a southern bor-
der crisis. I say that for a very clear
reason. There is no denying the fact
that the meth that is invading Mon-
tana and that is devastating Montana
is Mexican cartel meth. It is not home-
grown meth anymore; it is Mexican
cartel meth that is smuggled across
the southern border.
Mexican meth is cheaper and more
potent. In fact, several years ago, the
meth we saw in Montana was home-
grown meth. It had potency levels
around 25 percent. Today, the Mexican
cartel meth has a potency level of over
90 percent. That results in a much
more dangerous form of meth. It is
much more widespread, and the price
has dropped.
I have met with Montanans across
our State—whether it is law enforce-
ment, doctors, nurses, treatment facil-
ity professionals—to come together, to
work together, and to help combat the
meth crisis we see in Montana. I am
committed to fighting for more re-
sources that give law enforcement and
Border Patrol the tools they need to
fight this epidemic. I will also continue
to advocate for stronger support for
treatment and care for our most vul-
nerable. Those who are addicted to
meth need help, and they need compas-
sion.
One thing we absolutely must do to
help combat the drug epidemic is to se-
cure our southern border because with-
out secure borders, these illegal drugs
and meth will continue to come across
that southern border and have easy ac-
cess into our country and into States
like Montana. I won’t stand by and let
this be the norm.
Earlier this summer, I was honored
to welcome Vice President PENCE and
Karen Pence to Billings. They got to
see this crisis firsthand. They got to
hear directly from law enforcement
and Montana families impacted by the
crisis. I saw Vice President PENCE and
Mrs. Pence sitting around a table in-
side a facility that is helping moms
who are addicted to meth and who are
working with moms and their children
to get better. They were telling their
stories about how they have gotten
better through treatment at the Rim-
rock Foundation facility there in Bil-
lings and starting out a much brighter
chapter in their lives because of the
help provided from Rimrock.

work together to secure our borders
and protect our communities from ille-
gal drugs and to end this crisis.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas.
Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I
thank all of my colleagues and espe-
cially Senator DAINES for pointing out
what is happening in rural and
smalltown America. As a matter of
fact, most of my colleagues—Senator
HOEVEN, Senator CAPITO, Senator
DAINES, Senator BOOZMAN, Senator
BLACKBURN—all represent large States,
and we represent cities, of course, but
also rural and smalltown America. I
thank them for their concerted efforts.
We have all been working together.
I thank Senator HOEVEN more par-
ticularly for his work on funding, as he
is the distinguished chairman of the
Senate Agriculture Appropriations
Subcommittee, and I echo his support
for getting these appropriations bills
done.
I just want to talk and add to their
comments about this national issue of
immediate concern, substance abuse
and opioid addiction. I think it is time-
ly because just 1 year ago, the Presi-
dent of the United States signed the
SUPPORT for Patients and Commu-
nities Act into law. This was the legis-
lation that was the culmination of
months of bipartisan work. I emphasize
the word ‘‘bipartisan.’’ We talk about
it a lot but seldom see it. This is one
effort that we got done. This moved
across several committees and both
Chambers of Congress. So I think it is
something we can take great pride in,
showing folks back home that we can
actually do something together.
I am proud to be part of this effort on
behalf of both the Finance and HELP
Committees in the Senate. The legisla-
tion included a bill I introduced to en-
courage the use of electronic prior au-
thorization in Medicare Part D, which
would help overcome one of the pri-
mary challenges to patients receiving
their medications, including treat-
ments for substance abuse disorders
and non-opiate alternatives to treating
pain.
The SUPPORT Act also included our
language that would help shed light on
the best practices and the barriers to
using telehealth for treating substance
abuse disorders in children who are
covered under Medicaid. It will also
focus on how we can utilize telehealth
to help children in rural and under-
served areas, including how treatment
can be offered in school-based settings.
All of us who have spoken on this issue
have the same problem.
In last year’s farm bill, the Senate
Agriculture Committee, of which I am
proud to be chairman, also included
provisions to help those suffering from
substance abuse disorders, primarily in
our rural areas. We prioritized funding
in the community facilities and dis-
tance learning telemedicine programs
for projects focused on treating addic-
tion, including opiates.
I am proud of these efforts, but there
is so much work left to do to combat
addiction. This is a real epidemic as
has been stressed by my colleagues.
Real progress starts at the local
level. In my home State of Kansas, we
continue to need assistance in pre-
venting meth use, as was so eloquently
discussed by my colleague from Mon-
tana, Senator DAINES.
We still have use and abuse taking a
heavy toll on many communities
throughout the State. Patients suf-
fering from addiction in rural parts of
the country face many challenges in
accessing the clinical services they
really need. We have heard from many
Kansans who have to travel long dis-
tances, sometimes across State lines,
in order to access substance abuse
treatments.
I recently spoke with many Kansas
district attorneys for a second year in
a row. Last year they came in, and I
thought they were going to talk about
the criminal justice act that we had
just passed. No, they wanted to talk
about meth. I said: Well, wait a
minute, I thought we made some real
progress in eliminating the meth labs
in Kansas.
That is the case, but for a second
year in a row, they pointed out again
the meth coming in from Mexico,
which was demonstrated by Senator
DAINES. There was a tremendous con-
cern over this kind of meth, which is so
much more powerful. Their No. 1 con-
cern was individuals in many parts of
the State who were suffering from ad-
diction and constantly cycling through
the court system and clogging up the
courts. These individuals often do not
have access to substance abuse treat-
ments that can help control their ad-
diction and keep them out of the crimi-
nal justice system.
That is why I introduced this year
the Meth Addiction Act. All of us have
individual acts, and we also hope that
we can meld them together. This is a
bill to extend the reach of these treat-
ments to more people who so des-
perately need them. Our bill would
allow our community mental health
and addiction treatment facilities to
connect patients via telehealth to phy-
sicians who are authorized to prescribe
the controlled substances that treat
addiction. This would help to empower
local and rural providers to use every
tool necessary to combat this epi-
demic.
In addition, last year, I had the privi-
lege of attending a drug take-back
event in Kansas, hosted by Walgreens
and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kan-
sas. This is the kind of local initiative
that is especially important, as we
have consistently heard about the im-
portance of preventing diversion as one
way of combating this epidemic.
At the same time, we must be careful
and make sure that efforts to address
the problem do not deny patients the
controlled substances if they have a le-
gitimate and clinical need for these
treatments. That is why safe disposal
of these medications is such an impor-
tant tool in solving this very complex
issue. This initiative offers people
year-round options to help to prevent
diversion of addictive medications to
their friends and loved ones, without
limiting access to treatment.
Finally, I would like to recognize
that 2 weeks from now, the city of To-
peka, KS, the capital of Kansas, is
hosting the Kansas Opioid Conference.
The people who are truly on the
frontlines of the opioid crisis in Kansas
will be in attendance to address these
issues through all sorts of collabo-
rative efforts at the State level and the
local level. They are the ones who will
help us find the solution that will help
us make real and lasting progress
against this epidemic.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT
Mr. President, I have this important
message from a very important staff
member.
I ask unanimous consent that the
Senate now recess from 3 until 4 p.m.
today for a briefing.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
The Senator from Oregon.
REMEMBERING KAY HAGAN
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I am
deeply saddened to hear the news on
Monday of the death of our former col-
league, Kay Hagan.
She is the sister, the wife, and the
aunt of Navy veterans; daughter-in-law
to a two-star Marine Corps general;
daughter of a former Florida mayor;
and niece to a former U.S. Senator and
Governor. Service was in Kay Hagan’s
veins.
She spent an early career in financial
services, but it was only a matter of
time until she decided to get directly
engaged in public policy.
In office, she was a fierce and unwav-
ering advocate for our men and women
in uniform, a staunch fighter for the
right of every American to have
healthcare, and a warrior for women
and children. The people of North Caro-
lina and the people of the United
States are far better off because of her
years of service in the North Carolina
Senate and the 6 years in the U.S. Sen-
ate.
When she was here she worked on so
many different issues. She immersed
herself in trying to assist our military
personnel. She was the founding mem-
ber of the Military Family Caucus. She
championed the program that offers
education support for military spouses.
She cosponsored the repeal of don’t
ask, don’t tell, and she drove the inves-
tigation of the contamination of water
at Camp Lejeune and legislation to rec-
tify that.
She introduced the Hire a Hero Act
to try to enable our veterans to get
jobs and make that transition from
military service to civilian life. She led
the effort for overdue recognition of
African-American marines who were
forced to train at a separate camp out-
side Camp Lejeune, and that led them
to being awarded the Congressional
Gold Medal.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6281
October 30, 2019
When it came to women and children,
she was there every day in that fight—
the fight for a stronger Violence
Against Women Act and the fight for
the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, so
women can be paid commensurate with
their male colleagues. She authored
the Newborn Screening Saves Lives
Act to maintain and continue the sup-
port for mandatory screening for
newborns.
She fought for workers and middle-
class America and manufacturing jobs
for Americans and for equal oppor-
tunity by sponsoring the Employment
Nondiscrimination Act, which passed
on the Senate floor 6 years ago.
She proceeded to work on banking
and financial issues. She was the lead
on the SAFE Act Confidentiality and
Privilege Enhancement Act, which had
to do with some of the nitty-gritty of
mortgage licensing. She worked to en-
sure that groups like Habitat for Hu-
manity could lend money on a zero-in-
terest loan to their homeowners and be
able to do so without violating the
legal precepts of American law. It was
issue after issue.
When I think of her journey, I think
about the parallel structure between
her life and mine, in that she ran for
the legislature in North Carolina the
same year that I ran for the legislature
in Oregon. I won a seat in the Oregon
House and she won a seat in the North
Carolina Senate. We both spent 10
years there. We both then decided that
we should attempt to take our philos-
ophy of fighting for the people to the
U.S. Senate. We threw our hats into
the ring at the same moment, running
campaigns against incumbent Sen-
ators, and we both won.
I recall how every time I checked on
how she was doing, she was always
doing 5 to 10 points better than I was,
and I just kept thinking: I just have to
follow Kay Hagan’s example. Then, be-
fore the campaign was over, she called
me up one day, and we hadn’t actually
met much or talked much, and she
said: I just want to check in on how
you are doing.
We connected and bonded over our
parallel paths and the fight we were in,
which was such an intense effort of
campaigning with the desire and deter-
mination to make this country a better
place.
Of course, as I have noted, when she
got here, she threw herself into so
many aspects of our national life and
our legal structure. I was pleased that
we were both assigned by Senator KEN-
NEDY to the Health, Education, Labor,
and Pensions Committee. We were able
to work on the ACA, or the Affordable
Care Act, to try to greatly increase
health coverage and make it more af-
fordable and available throughout
America—really important for the peo-
ple of North Carolina, the citizens of
my State, and citizens across this
country.
Then, we were both assigned to the
Banking Committee, and it was Dodd-
Frank. We worked on questions such as
how do we end some of the predatory
lending practices? Both of us worked
on payday-loan predatory actions,
where interest rates could be 500 per-
cent. We knew the damage done to our
families across the country. We didn’t
succeed on that particular piece of leg-
islation—the payday loan piece—but
we were stemming in this fight from
the same place. I so applaud her deter-
mination to end predatory practices
and lending.
Many of the things that we were
fighting for did get into Dodd-Frank in
terms of fairness and mortgages so
that homeownership would be a dream
of homeownership that would result in
equity for middle-class Americans
rather than a nightmare of homeown-
ership, in which interest rates would
double after 2 years, and the family
would go bankrupt, and they would be
foreclosed on and could lose their
house.
Apart from all of that, Kay was such
a beautiful voice and spirit in this
Chamber—cheerful, determined,
thoughtful, gracious. She just made
you enjoy being here.
I also think about her, as when she
served, she was the healthiest Member
of this Chamber. She paid a lot of at-
tention to the diet she ate, the food she
ate, how she exercised, how she
brought balance to her life. That, too,
was an inspiration to us.
Here we find that our journeys on
this planet are pretty precarious. We
never know what is going to happen on
the next day or the next week. I think
it is a reminder to all of us to use our
moments wisely, to treat each other
with the sort of graciousness she exem-
plified—this sort of spirited fighting
for ‘‘we the people,’’ the people of the
United States for whom she was deter-
mined to deploy and champion on the
floor of the Senate.
Her illness and her death are a real
loss to all of us. It is important that we
carry her in our hearts. She certainly
has a place solidly secured in my heart
and, I think, the hearts of everyone
who served with her.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 949
Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I am
very happy to be joined on the floor
with Senator MERKLEY, who has
worked with me for a long time on the
For the People Act, and we will both be
speaking here in that order.
The American people sent us here to
do the people’s business, but under Re-
publican leadership, the Senate is not
responding to what the American peo-
ple need and want. We are not solving
the kitchen table issues the American
people elected us to face every day.
For example, we are not making sure
every American has access to afford-
able, quality healthcare. We need to
lower costs and take on Big Pharma,
and we are not doing that. We are not
passing commonsense gun safety legis-
lation that 90 percent of the voters sup-
port in order to stop shootings in the
schools, on our streets, and in our com-
munities. If we can’t pass bills that
save children’s lives, our democracy is
not working. We are not even taking
on the most pressing issue that faces
our planet—climate change. Younger
generations are urging us to act, but
this body is running away from taking
any action.
The number of gravestones in the
majority leader’s legislative grave-
yard—where urgent bills are stalled
and buried—steadily mounts. Bills
keep going into the majority leader’s
graveyard, but Congress will not and
cannot do the people’s business when
the bills to fix our democracy also rest
in that graveyard.
The House of Representatives over-
whelmingly passed the For the People
Act, H.R. 1. It passed it in March. At
the same time, I introduced the Senate
companion to the For the People Act,
which has the support of all 47 Demo-
crats and Independents in the Senate.
Yet, along with a pile of other good and
necessary bills, Leader MCCONNELL has
buried the For the People Act.
The For the People Act repairs our
broken campaign finance system, opens
up the ballot box to all Americans, and
lays waste to the corruption in Wash-
ington. These are all reforms that the
American people support. Why will the
Senate majority leader not let us vote
on them?
There is hardly a day that goes by
that we don’t see evidence of why it is
so important that we pass the For the
People Act. Foreign influence in our
elections is only growing, and 2016 was
just the start. Associates of the Presi-
dent’s personal lawyer have been in-
dicted for laundering foreign money
into our elections. The President’s law-
yer is under investigation for the same.
Political ads from foreign sources are
flooding social media.
Our bill fights foreign tampering in
our democracy. It prohibits domestic
corporations with foreign control from
spending money in U.S. elections. It
cracks down on shell companies that
are used in order to launder foreign
money into our elections. Our bill
makes sure that American elections

are decided by American voters with-
out there being foreign interference. It
protects our democratic institutions,
increases oversight over election ven-
dors, requires paper ballots, and sup-
ports security upgrades for States’ vot-
ing systems.
This body should have gotten serious
about election security immediately
after the 2016 election, but under the
majority leader’s direction, we have
not done that.
At a time of increased foreign inter-
ference, the President has invited for-
eign assistance in any way it might
benefit him personally, politically, or
financially. Day in and day out, we see
this President taking full advantage of
his position to benefit himself, his fam-
ily, and his political prospects.
The President never divested. He
never formed a blind trust for his as-
sets. Every day, we see foreign officials
and foreign nationals currying favor
with the President and padding his
pocketbook, wining and dining at the
Trump properties. Indeed, Mr. Giuliani
and his two close associates lunched at
the Trump International Hotel, right
here in Washington, just before these
two individuals were picked up at the
Washington Dulles International Air-
port with their one-way tickets abroad.
The same individuals have been
charged with illegally funneling for-
eign money into our democracy. In ad-
dition, the President only relented
from hosting the next G7 summit at his
Doral resort in Miami after the Repub-
licans told him that even they couldn’t
defend that.
All the while, the President calls the
emoluments clause—intended to stop
these very abuses—phony.
The For the People Act requires the
President to fully disclose his or her fi-
nancial interests and disclose the last
10 years of his or her tax returns, which
is something this President has never
done. It requires the President to fully
divest and transfer all of his or her as-
sets to a blind trust. The American
people deserve to know their President
is acting in the national interest, not
in his or her own self-interest, and not
being subjected to leverage by foreign
interests that seek to corrupt our elec-
toral process.
The intelligence community has been
very clear with its disturbing warn-
ings. Adverse foreign interests are ac-
tively trying to manipulate our democ-
racy. They did so in 2016 as the Mueller
report and prosecutions from that in-
vestigation confirmed. They will try to
do so again in 2020. We are watching it
happen in realtime before our eyes.
These foreign interests are not red or
blue—not Democratic or Republican.
They will use whomever they can to
pursue their interests—interests that
are often opposed to ours or are simply
corrupt. We must unite in the defense
of our electoral system and in the de-
fense of the sanctity of our democracy.
Like the other bills the Democrats are
seeking to pass this week, the For the
People Act would provide that protec-
tion. The House’s version, H.R. 1, would
do so as well.
We want to partner with the Repub-
licans in these efforts, and we are open
to negotiation. Yet, while the Amer-
ican people demand that we fix our
out-of-control campaign finance sys-
tem, make sure elections are secure,
and root out the corruption in Wash-
ington, bills to address these issues
gather dust on the leader’s desk.
I, for one, will not stop fighting for
the comprehensive democratic reforms
that we need and for bringing power
back to the people—where the Found-
ers intended it to be. Our democracy
will always be worth the fight.
Once again, Senator MERKLEY has
been a great partner to work with on
the For the People Act.
I yield to the Senator from Oregon.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon.
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I
am honored to join my colleague who
has led this battle for the vision of the
For the People Act that will restore
the ‘‘we the people’’ democratic repub-
lic.
Here we are on the floor of the Sen-
ate. It is an institution that once re-
verberated with great debates on the
great issues our Nation faced—issues of
war and peace, of civil rights, of
healthcare and housing, of education
and infrastructure, and of living-wage
jobs; issues of equal opportunity and of
environmental pollution; issues that
affect the fundamental success of each
family in America and our collective
success as a nation.
Yet, if you are sitting here today and
are observing the Senate from the
benches up above, you will be hard-
pressed to see any of that because
those debates are not happening in the
U.S. Senate. This Chamber is silent on
the great issues that face America.
Before he was the majority leader,
the majority leader promised that
things would be different under his
leadership.
He said:
A Senate majority under my leadership
would break sharply from the practices of
the Reid era in favor of a far more free-
wheeling approach to problem solving. I
would work to restore its traditional role as
a place where good ideas are generated, de-
bated and voted upon.
Now, one of the fundamental prin-
ciples is that every Senator should be
able to raise any issue and have the
chance to defend it, to present it, to
see it attacked, to respond to those at-
tacks, and to have the American people
see where we stand. But, today, the
Senate is not operating in that manner
today. The reality is reflected in a dif-
ferent quote by the majority leader
from this past year.
He said:
Donald Trump is still in the White House,
and as long as I am Majority Leader of the
Senate, I get to set the agenda. That’s why
I call myself the Grim Reaper.
The majority leader is taking great
pride in preventing this Chamber from
being the legislative body that was en-
visioned in the Constitution, one in
which we examine the issues that the
citizens of our States present to us
with great concern and ask us to re-
solve so as to take this Nation forward.
Instead, we are deeply mired in the leg-
islative graveyard that the majority
leader has been so proud to create.
How about the Bipartisan Back-
ground Checks Act? It is now engraved
on a tombstone. The Paycheck Fair-
ness Act? Engraved on a tombstone.
Violence Against Women? On a tomb-
stone—or how about Save the Internet?
Or the Climate Action Now Act?
How about healthcare? Across my
State, in rural areas and urban areas,
everybody wants the same fair price,
even if they have preexisting condi-
tions. That is the fundamental nature
of an effective insurance strategy for
healthcare, but the Protecting Ameri-
cans With Preexisting Conditions Act
has never been debated on this floor.
The American Dream and Promise
Act, the Securing America’s Federal
Elections Act? How about the Raise
the Wage Act? How about the Equality
Act that grants every member of our
society, LGBTQ Americans, the full op-
portunity to have the doors of oppor-
tunity opened, rather than slammed
shut—debated and passed just down the
hall, each and every one of these bills,
but here, they haven’t been debated.
The Senate is failing its constitutional
responsibility.
In fact, during the last 2 years, there
has only been three priorities that
have seemed to have arisen in this
Chamber. One was the goal of stripping
healthcare from 30 million Americans.
It failed by the slimmest of margins. A
second is to pack the courts with
judges who believe in a supercharged
amendment to give power to the power-
ful, rather than power to the people.
The third is a $2 trillion tax cut to
enrich the richest Americans. In any
chamber that truly represents the peo-
ple, you don’t see the goal of destroy-
ing healthcare for 30 million Ameri-
cans and giving $2 trillion to the rich-
est Americans. But that is what we
have seen here, while we fail to see the
bills on healthcare, on housing, on edu-
cation, on infrastructure, on living
wage jobs—the fundamentals by which
the American families prosper.
Why is it that this Chamber is now a
completely owned subsidiary of the
most powerful people in this country?
It is because of the fundamental cor-
ruption of our constitutional system,
starting with gerrymandering.
Many of us hear that phrase, ‘‘equal
representation,’’ and understand we are
talking about fundamental fairness of
distributed power, but gerrymandering
is the opposite of that. The Supreme
Court has given complete license to ex-
treme partisan gerrymandering, in-
stead of defending the constitutional
vision of equal representation. It is
principle in a democracy and in a re-
public that the citizens choose their
legislators, the legislators don’t choose

their citizens. But that legislation to
address that, to create nonpartisan
commissions to prevent that gerry-
mandering, hasn’t been debated on the
floor of this Chamber.
A second piece of corruption is voter
suppression. The Supreme Court
opened the doors by gutting the Voting
Rights Act, again failing to defend the
vision of the Constitution. But have we
remedied that here on this floor? Have
we addressed that fundamental corrup-
tion in which all kinds of tactics are
created to prevent people from voting
across this country—all kinds of clever
ID laws to disempower communities
that are minority communities or col-
lege communities or poor communities
or Native American communities? We
have not.
There is perhaps the most vicious
form of corruption, the dark money
flowing through our campaign systems.
Jefferson was very clear that if you
have government by the powerful, you
end up with laws for the powerful. So
you have to have distributed power so
that the power of the people results in
laws that reflect the will of the people.
That is the difference between the vi-
sion of our constitutional system here
in the United States of America and
the system of kingships that domi-
nated Europe.
But because of the corruption of dark
money in our campaign system, it has
created the concentration of power, the
exact opposite of what Jefferson laid
out and our Founders laid out in our
Constitution. We start our Constitu-
tion with those powerful first three
words, ‘‘We the people,’’ because that is
the vision of our Constitution—not
‘‘We the powerful,’’ not ‘‘We the privi-
leged.’’
So a bill has been crafted, H.R. 1, the
For the People Act. My colleague from
New Mexico has led this charge to ad-
dress this fundamental corruption in
order to restore the vision our Nation
was founded on because, if we restore
that foundation, then we would be ad-
dressing healthcare on the floor of the
Senate, making it more affordable,
stopping the price gouging of Ameri-
cans, the challenges of access in com-
munities across this country.
We would be addressing the shortage
of housing that is driving a homeless
epidemic in this country, partly be-
cause of the economics, the structure
of our economy, and partly because of
unaddressed mental illness and drug
addiction.
We would be addressing education be-
cause education is the path to full par-
ticipation; yet today, we have seen a
shrinkage of the opportunities through
apprenticeships for working people and
through college—affordable college for
the dreams taking you in that direc-
tion if you weren’t previously burdened
by a debt the size of a home mortgage.
We would be addressing infrastructure
and jobs. We would be addressing the
environmental challenges our planet
faces if we restore the vision of our
Constitution.
This For the People Act is the most
important piece of legislation because
everything else we care about as Amer-
icans is going to fail if we let this
Chamber be controlled by powerful spe-
cial interests through this corrupted
system. So let’s take it on. Let’s take
on the gerrymandering and the voter
suppression and the dark money. Let’s
have the courage to debate it on this
floor because that is what we were
elected to do, was to work on the big
challenges facing our Nation, and there
is perhaps no bigger challenge than
this.
Madam President, I yield back to my
colleague from New Mexico.
Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent that the Finance
Committee be discharged from further
consideration of S. 949, the Senate pro-
ceed to its immediate consideration;
that the bill be considered read a third
time and passed; and the motion to re-
consider be made and laid upon the
table with no intervening action or de-
bate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Missouri.
Mr. BLUNT. Reserving the right to
object, I would like to object. I would
like to talk about this bill for a
minute.
In March, the House passed a bill
that would give the Federal Govern-
ment unprecedented control over elec-
tions in this country, despite the fact
that, for more than 200 years, we have
had a history of State-run elections.
That diversity is part of the strength
of our system. I objected to the request
at that time to pass that bill.
S. 949 appears to be almost exactly
the same bill. Apparently, the powerful
special interests that my friend, Mr.
MERKLEY, talked about are the State
governments because that is where we
are taking authority from here. We are
taking authority from the State gov-
ernments.
The For the People Act is really the
For the Federal Government Act. It
represents a one-size-fits-all Federal
power grab that would take control of
election administration away from the
States, at the great expense to the
American people. It requires all the
States to fit into, frankly, what House
Democrats saw as a narrow view of
what elections should look like and,
just as frankly, what House Democrats
for 20 years have had in mind that
would in every case, in their view, give
them an advantage in the election
process. The security of our elections
comes, in large part, from the very di-
versity of the way they are set up and
the way they are administered. This
bill would really undermine that de-
centralized system.
I spent 20 years as an election offi-
cial, part of it as the chief election au-
thority in what was then the third
largest county in our State, and the
rest of it was as the secretary of state,
the chief election official. I know for a
fact that people who conduct these
elections are unbelievably focused on a
fair process before an election day and
on election day.
I also know for a fact that the very
fact that they can’t blame some far-
away regulator on their inability to do
what needs to be done makes a dif-
ference. I have seen that happen at 6
o’clock in the morning. I have seen it
happen at 12 midnight as the last pre-
cinct comes in. I have seen it happen as
people were doing everything they can
to be sure that people that are trying
to vote are able to vote. I have seen the
development of the provisional ballot
system that the States all use now if
someone for some reason believes they
should vote and the records aren’t
there to allow that.
So there are a lot of things that Sen-
ator MERKLEY understands better than
I do. I am sure there are a lot of things
that Senator UDALL understands better
than I do. I look forward to the times
when I have and will continue to seek
advice for them on those issues. I am
pretty sure that this is an issue that,
at least from the point of view of the
strength of the local election system
and the State election system, I have
reason to have confidence.
In fact, former President Obama ex-
pressed the same view when he said:
‘‘There is no serious person out there
who would suggest somehow that you
could even rig America’s elections, in
part, because they are so decentralized
and the numbers of votes involved.’’ He
said that late summer, early fall 2016.
I think that was true when he said it;
I think it is true now. This bill tells
States how to run every aspect of their
elections. It takes away the authority
of the States to determine their own
process for voter registration. In fact,
it requires online voter registration. If
you are trying to focus on election se-
curity, online voter registration would
not be at the top of that list.
It requires automatic voter registra-
tion. It requires same-day registration.
It requires States to accept voter reg-
istrations from people who are not old
enough to vote yet. It dictates the cri-
teria that people can be removed from
the voter rolls or can’t be. It tells the
States what kind of election equipment
they must use, how their ballots must
be counted, how the ballot counts must
be audited. It even goes so far as to tell
the States as to what kinds of marks
must be made on ballot-marking de-
vices and what kind of paper their bal-
lots must be printed on. It tells States
they must offer early voting sites. It
tells them those early voting sites
where they must be and what hours
they must operate.
The bill doesn’t stop at election ad-
ministration. It tells States how they
redistrict, how they establish redis-
tricting commissions, who can be ap-
pointed to that commission, how the
lines are drawn. This would be a major
Federal takeover of a system that
would not benefit from that takeover.
It also creates a program for public fi-
nancing for elections, tax dollars to
politicians to run elections with.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6284 October 30, 2019
And so, Madam President, I do object
to the unanimous consent request, and
I think for good reason.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
Mr. UDALL. Madam President, this
bill does just the opposite. It supports
States. It doesn’t take over from
States. The States have asked us for
help when it comes to actions like cy-
bersecurity and other things that are
happening out there. It roots out for-
eign interference in our elections
which happens in Federal elections and
happens in State elections and, I think,
can only be done at the Federal level.
The distinguished Senator from Mis-
souri says that these things that are
being required, States are adopting all
of these. States are moving very ag-
gressively forward with things like
automatic registration and moving to
make it easier to vote, and we are try-
ing to lay a consistent basis so the
States know how to operate. So this is
a good bill. It is a solid bill. It puts the
American people back in charge.
I yield the floor.
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I
might just respond by saying that, if
States are adopting these things be-
cause they think they are a good idea,
that is one thing. For Washington, DC,
to tell them they have to do it because
we think it is a good idea, that is an-
other thing. If my friend from New
Mexico is right and States are adopting
many of these changes, I guess there
would be no particular reason to have
the bill. I am pleased that this is a bill
that is going to take further study be-
fore it is ready to come to the Senate
Floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire.
H.R. 3055
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President,
the substitute amendment to H.R. 3055
contains the Appropriations Com-
mittee-reported versions of four bills:
Agriculture; Interior; Transportation,
Housing and Urban Development, one
bill; and Commerce, Justice, Science
and Related Agencies.
I was very excited to see today’s ear-
lier cloture vote, which passed 88 to 5,
which means that we can see those four
bills to help fund government move
forward.
The Commerce-Justice-Science por-
tion of this minibus, or CJS, was re-
ported out of the Appropriations Com-
mittee on a unanimous 31-to-0 vote. I
particularly care about this bill as
ranking member on that sub-
committee.
The CJS bill provides $70.8 billion to
protect the Nation from criminals and
terrorists, warn us about violent
storms and climate change, enable fair
trade, promote manufacturing and sus-
tainable fisheries, partner with State
and local law enforcement, and provide
resources for the census to count every
person in the United States fairly and
accurately.
CJS Subcommittee Chairman MORAN
and I took a collaborative approach to
drafting this important bill. The CJS
Subcommittee held substantive hear-
ings, considered 1,564 individual and
group requests from 75 Senators, and
worked in a bipartisan way to meet the
needs of the Nation and our individual
States.
Under the Constitution, since 1790,
every 10 years the United States has
conducted the census, and we only get
one chance every 10 years to get it
right. In addition to determining the
number of Representatives each State
will have, Federal programs rely on
census data to distribute more than
$900 billion annually, nearly $4 billion
of which goes to my home State of New
Hampshire.
Chairman MORAN and I have worked
together to make sure the census has
the resources it needs. The bill pro-
vides $7.6 billion for the Bureau of the
Census—nearly double the amount pro-
vided in fiscal year 2019. This fully
funds the life-cycle estimate for the
2020 census, along with contingencies
that have been recommended by Sec-
retary Ross but were not requested in
the budget.
The bill also directs the Census Bu-
reau to invest in partnership and com-
munication efforts in hard-to-count
areas in order to increase self-response
rates and offset the need for expensive
door-to-door followup.
Once again, the subcommittee has
provided increases to law enforcement
and grant programs that fight gun vio-
lence and violent crime. The bill in-
cludes at least a 3-percent increase for
Justice Department law enforcement
agencies—more than $476 million high-
er than the fiscal year 2019 level for the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms
and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement
Administration, the FBI, and the Mar-
shals Service.
Especially important, we have pro-
vided $131 million for the FBI’s Na-
tional Instant Criminal Background
Check System, NICS—$24 million more
than last year. This system is the key
to making sure firearms are purchased
legally and helping keep weapons out
of the hands of those who wish to do
harm. The bill includes increases for
States to improve record submission to
NICS and for mental health courts.
We continue to provide the full $100
million authorized for STOP School Vi-
olence Act grants. But as we know, gun
violence isn’t just happening in
schools, so we have included funding
for other grant programs, like $8 mil-
lion for community-based violence pre-
vention and nearly 10 percent more for
the Office of Juvenile Justice and De-
linquency Prevention to help keep chil-
dren and their families safe in their
neighborhoods.
We are also addressing another form
of violence facing our law enforcement
officers, and that is police suicide. I
would really like to provide more sta-
tistics regarding this important issue
of police suicide, but unfortunately I
can’t, and neither can anybody in this
body because no Federal agencies col-
lect data on the subject. That is why in
the CJS bill, we direct the Justice De-
partment to begin a national data col-
lection to report on police suicide so
we can all better understand the scope
of the problem. We also direct the De-
partment to report on best practices
for officer mental health and wellness
programs, including peer mentoring.
One thing we do know about police
suicides, though, is that we lose more
police officers to suicide each year
than we do to officers killed in the line
of duty. Our police officers need help
now, so we have been able to add $3
million for grants to allow State and
local law enforcement to provide im-
proved mental health services, training
to reduce the stigma of officers seeking
help, and programs to address resil-
iency for departments and officers to
handle repeated exposure to stress and
trauma.
This is an issue, sadly, we know all
too well in New Hampshire, where in
the last couple of months, in the city
of Nashua—our second-largest city—we
lost a very much appreciated, well-re-
spected, and loved police officer to sui-
cide. We were lucky because the chief
of the Nashua Police Department and
the family of that officer were willing
to talk about that suicide to raise con-
cern about this issue so that we can
know and try to address it.
Another area of funding in this bill
that will help our first responders, in
addition to the support to our State
and local governments and community
organizations, is the $505 million in
dedicated grant programs to fight sub-
stance abuse, including opioids, and to
fight drug trafficking. This amount is
$37 million higher than the fiscal year
2019 level and $127.5 million higher than
the budget request.
In part because of the resources we
have brought to bear on the opioid cri-
sis in New Hampshire and throughout
New England, the substance use dis-
order epidemic is developing and
changing, and we are now seeing a
rapid rise in the use and trafficking of
meth amphetamines. When efforts are
focused on preventing and stopping one
drug, sadly, we see others gain trac-
tion, and that is what is happening.
After hearing from local law enforce-
ment and community organizations,
this bill provides more flexibility to
allow communities to respond to a va-
riety of substance abuse issues in addi-
tion to opioids in the Comprehensive
Opioid, Stimulant, and Substance
Abuse Program. Communities should
not be turning away individuals who
have substance use disorders because
we have a narrow definition of the pro-
grams that can help.
Another way this bill seeks to keep
Granite State communities vibrant—
and this helps other communities that
depend on coastal economies—is we re-
ject the elimination of grants that help
our coastal communities and their
economies. The bill keeps key weather
satellites on track and provides an in-
crease for job-supporting coastal pro-
grams like Sea Grant, Coastal Zone

Management Grants, the National
Oceans and Coastal Security Fund, and
the National Estuarine Research Re-
serve System.
The bill includes continued funding
to prevent a burdensome and costly at-
sea monitoring fee from being imposed
on New Hampshire and other New Eng-
land fishermen. I have heard directly
from our fishermen in New Hampshire
that without this support, they would
have to stop fishing and declare bank-
ruptcy. So many seacoast communities
rely on a strong fishing industry. That
is why the bill also includes $2.5 mil-
lion for New England groundfish re-
search, including looking at measures
to improve stock assessments.
Beyond the National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration, NOAA, the
bill also supports strong investments
in research and development at the Na-
tional Science Foundation; the Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration, NASA; and the National Insti-
tute of Standards and Technology,
NIST. The bill includes a 5-percent in-
crease for NIST, which is an agency
that promotes U.S. innovation and
competitiveness through scientific and
technological standards and measure-
ment.
I am pleased that the bill provides $2
million for NIST to study whether fire-
fighters are subject to PFAS exposure,
a chemical that has been linked to seri-
ous adverse health implications.
What we have seen is that—we think
the actual equipment that is used by so
many firefighters has PFAS chemicals
in that equipment, so that while risk-
ing their lives fighting fires, fire-
fighters also may be exposed to a dan-
gerous chemical that can affect their
health. The last thing our firefighters
need when they are on duty is to be
concerned about the safety of their
own firefighting gear.
Within NASA, we have provided bal-
anced funding that enables science sup-
ported by decadal surveys, supports the
International Space Station, continues
developing and flying new transpor-
tation systems, and allows for an even-
tual return to the Moon by humans.
We have also provided more than $900
million to restore widely supported
programs that the administration pro-
posed to eliminate—programs like
Space Grant; EPSCoR; the Wide Field
Infrared Telescope or W-FIRST; the
Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud ocean Eco-
system mission, PACE; and Restore-L.
What is important about these pro-
grams is that they allow young peo-
ple—students in every State—to be in-
volved with NASA and implement
high-priority science objectives and to
get excited about space and the oppor-
tunities space investment offers us.
These are some of the highlights of
just the Commerce-Justice-Science
portion of this minibus. I believe it is a
strong, comprehensive bill. I am proud
it is on the floor. I hope it is going to
pass with as strong a margin as we saw
this morning’s vote give us, and I hope
we will be able to enact this bill into
law before the current continuing fund-
ing resolution expires on November 21.
I want to give credit to all of the
members of both the majority and the
minority on the Appropriations sub-
committee that helped negotiate our
CJS bill and all of the bills that are on
the floor. They do tremendous work,
and they deserve our credit for all of
their effort.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah.
GOVERNMENT FUNDING
Mr. ROMNEY. Madam President, I
rise today to talk about two problems
that are related. These two problems
have been spoken about for I think vir-
tually decades here in this Chamber
and across the political spectrum.
One relates to preserving our ex-
traordinary entitlement programs—So-
cial Security, Medicare, our highway
trust fund, and the like. These pro-
grams are very much under threat be-
cause within 13 years, each of these
trust funds, each of these programs
will face insolvency.
The other problem I want to talk
about is the massive overspending, the
deficit and the debt we have. That is
something which Republicans and
Democrats have been speaking about
for a long time, although speaking
about it less frequently as of late.
These two problems are related be-
cause two-thirds of our spending at the
Federal level is automatic. It is associ-
ated with our entitlement programs.
So let me start with the debt.
When I was running for President and
when I had the chance also to run for
the Senate, the No. 1 issue among the
people in my State was the issue of
whether we would stop spending more
money than we take in. We took in
about $3 trillion last year in tax rev-
enue, but we spent about $4 trillion.
There are some people who have de-
cided to stop thinking about the def-
icit, to stop worrying about the debt,
but as the debt reaches almost $23 tril-
lion, it is beginning to be a real issue.
I don’t think we are about to face a
failed auction where people won’t be
willing to buy our debt. We are, after
all, the reserve currency of the world,
and people want to have American dol-
lars. But I am concerned that the in-
terest is beginning to have an enor-
mous impact on our capacity to meet
our priorities.
Last year we spent almost $300 bil-
lion on interest on the Federal debt,
and over time, this debt, as we add to
it year after year after year, is going to
mean that the burden of interest pay-
ments on the American people will get
larger and larger.
There is a small group of people who
say: Well, this isn’t a problem because
interest rates are so low.
Well, it is not a problem until it be-
comes a problem, because if interest
rates start creeping up at some point,
it can become an extraordinary burden
on the American people.
If we are sending hundreds of billions
of dollars to people like the Chinese,
when they use those dollars to confront
our military, we have a real problem
leading the free world.
The issue is, how come we can’t deal
with the debt and the deficits, and why
haven’t we been able to do so? There
has been effort to talk about that, even
though more recently it has been kind
of quiet. It relates, of course, to what I
started to speak about, which are our
trust funds, with Medicare, with Social
Security, our retirement programs. So-
cial Security, the disability program,
as well as the highway trust funds—
these are scheduled to run out of
money within 13 years.
To deal with this issue, Senator JOE
MANCHIN, Senator TODD YOUNG, Sen-
ator DOUG JONES, Senator KYRSTEN
SINEMA, and I have proposed something
called the TRUST Act. It is designed to
save the trust funds associated with
these major programs. It is designed to
make sure we have a process for finally
getting balance in Social Security—
both trust funds in Social Security, as
well as Medicare, as well as the high-
way trust fund.
This is an effort that has been under-
taken in the past unsuccessfully, and a
lot of people say that it can’t be done
now. But it has to be done now. If it is
not done now, the burden that will fall
on our seniors eventually will become
extraordinary. And the burden that
will fall on the next generation, as
they don’t know whether Social Secu-
rity and Medicare be can be depended
upon, is unthinkable.
The approach that Senator MANCHIN
and these other Senators and I have
taken is pretty straightforward. We are
not laying out a specific plan to change
these programs. Instead, we have laid
out a process for modernizing these
programs.
For each one of these trust funds, our
bill proposes that the leaders—Repub-
licans and Democrats—in both Cham-
bers, House and Senate, put together a
rescue committee. For each trust fund,
there will be a rescue committee that
goes to work to see if, on a bipartisan,
bicameral basis, we can come up with a
solution to get these trust funds on a
solvent basis for at least 75 years.
That is an effort that will be success-
ful only if both parties agree. If we do
get that agreement in any one or each
one of these different rescue commit-
tees, on a privileged basis, their rec-
ommendation, their proposal, their bill
will be brought to the floor of the
House and Senate and voted upon.
On that basis, we have a process for
actually resolving the insolvency issue
that faces Social Security, Medicare,
and the highway trust fund. We also
have a pathway to finally get our budg-
et balanced and end the extraordinary
growth in our debt and the burden the
interest payments are having on the
American people today and in the fu-
ture.
I look forward to hearing from my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I
hope we get great support from people
who are willing to sponsor this effort

to be part of these rescue committees,
to go to work to resolve the impending
challenges that we have in these trust
funds and in our overall financial sta-
tus.
I mentioned the names of the Sen-
ators I have been working with to put
together this TRUST Act. I also want
to mention a number of Congresspeople
who are helping out and our cospon-
sors, original cosponsors: MIKE GALLA-
GHER, ED CASE, and BEN MCADAMS.
Again, Republicans and Democrats,
House and Senate—together, I think
we can finally save these essential pro-
grams.
With that, I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia.
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I want
to thank my good friend Senator ROM-
NEY for taking this initiative and, basi-
cally, all of us working together.
Let me say this. We were Governors
together—the Governor from Massa-
chusetts and the Governor from West
Virginia. The bottom line is, we had
the same balanced budget amendment
we had to work with. We had to work
on a daily basis, a weekly basis—what-
ever it took—to balance our States’
budgets. We had to stay within our
means. We couldn’t spend more than
what we had coming in, and we
couldn’t put our people in debt.
That was something I thought was
pretty simple because it is the same
thing you do in your personal life, the
same thing you do in your small busi-
ness or large corporation: You live
within your means. If you are going to
grow, then you grow, basically, in a
balanced way.
As Senator ROMNEY has said, our
debt is almost $23 trillion. You can
look back through history when we
have hit these numbers, but then if you
look back, during the war, we weren’t
worried about balancing the budget
during the war. We were worrying
about whether we would survive as na-
tion, and we did.
Coming out of that war, we had over
100 percent debt to GDP. We were able
to bring that back down and work in a
prudent manner. Then it ballooned up.
Let me tell you how I signed on to
Bowles-Simpson. If you look at recent
history, the last time—and the only
time for 40 years—we balanced the
budget was in 1997, up to 2001. That was
with Erskine Bowles and John Casey
working together—a Democrat work-
ing for President Bill Clinton and a Re-
publican Congressman from Ohio. They
sat down and worked out a plan and a
tax system that worked for America. It
worked so well that we were spinning
out, basically, surpluses.
We were told that by 2006 we would
be debt-free on the path we were going.
We had 9/11 come up. We had two wars
we never paid for—the first time. I tell
people, if you are a Democrat and you
want to blame Republicans, go ahead.
They are guilty. If you are a Repub-
lican and you want to blame Demo-
crats, go ahead. They are just as
guilty. There is basically blame for
both sides. But sooner or later, you
have to do something.
When Erskine Bowles and Alan Simp-
son came together, Democrats and Re-
publicans said: We have to get our fi-
nancial house in order.
It made sense to me. I had just been
elected. It was in early 2011. I was
elected in November 2010. I started
looking, and it made sense. We came so
close that it would have been forced to
a vote, as Senator ROMNEY has just ex-
plained the TRUST Act.
We think that someone has to have
their eye on the ball here because when
these interest rates balloon—and they
will—and when people lose confidence
and faith and will not put their money
in and buy our paper, basically, for the
low return we are giving them—or no
return at times—and demand more,
then we are going to have to outbid,
and it is going to cost a lot more to do
business in our country.
Sooner or later, we are basically
writing checks our kids can’t cash.
That is about it in a nutshell. If we are
responsible to leave our children and
the next generation in better shape
than how we received it, we have done
a very poor job. We truly have.
Again, I thank the good Senator from
Utah for basically bringing this fiscal
plan we have worked together on and
looking at where we are. The roadmap
is pretty clear. If you haven’t learned
from history, you will make history.
And it is not going to be a good kind of
history you are going to make.
Let me tell you who these recessions
hit the most. In my State, I have a
very hard-working State, a very rural
State, and a State that is not of the
highest per capita income in the coun-
try by any means. With that, they are
the first ones who get hurt. If we don’t
really care about Social Security, if we
don’t care about the highway trust
fund, infrastructure, if we don’t care
about Medicare—this is a life-sus-
taining influx of money they have be-
cause very few people who work from
paycheck to paycheck are able to put
money aside so that they don’t need
Social Security and they can pay their
own medical bills.
I have seen the effect of this. I can
tell you, it is not pleasant. I have peo-
ple on my side of the aisle who talk
about Medicare for All. That is aspira-
tional. We can’t even pay for Medicare
for Some—the ‘‘some’’ who have al-
ready earned it and paid into it.
By 2026, we are going to be in default.
We are going to be out of funds. By
2032, Social Security could be out of
funds. These are things that are fixable
now. They will not be fixable in 2026 for
Medicare. It will be too late. For Social
Security, in 2030, 2032, it will be too
late, and that is just around the corner.
For the highway trust fund, look at the
infrastructure. Everyone who has run
for President within the last decade or
so basically has talked about a big in-
frastructure package. It will be the
first thing they have done. They get
elected, and guess what happens. Noth-
ing. We don’t see an infrastructure
package.
It is the most politically right thing
you can do. A pothole doesn’t have an
R’s or a D’s name on it. It is not par-
tisan. It will bust your tire, and it will
break your rim. It doesn’t care who
you are.
These are things we can fix, and they
are things we can do to gain the trust
of the public. Yet we fail to do them.
We continue to divide this country and
push us apart. This TRUST Act is what
will bring us back together. It will put
our priorities where they should be.
All of us have run for public office.
We have put our names out there. We
can go out there and explain: We are
protecting your Social Security.
If you want to protect Social Secu-
rity, then do something. The TRUST
Act does that.
We are going to take care of your
Medicare. Do you want to take care of
Medicare? Support the TRUST Act. It
will do that.
These are things we can do, and we
can do them now. We shouldn’t wait.
We should bring this back to the floor,
and you should go on record to vote.
Are you really going to support Social
Security? Are you really going to sup-
port Medicare? Then vote.
If you don’t have the guts to vote,
that means you don’t support Social
Security, and you don’t support Medi-
care, and quit being a hypocrite going
out there campaigning and saying you
do. That is really what it comes down
to.
We are just trying to fix something
in an orderly fashion, where everybody
has it—bipartisan, bicameral. If we
can’t do this bipartisan, bicameral, we
can’t do anything in a bipartisan, bi-
cameral way. This is where we are
today.
I thank my dear friend. I really do. I
thank my friend Senator ROMNEY for
saying: Let’s do this, Joe.
I said: Absolutely, MITT, I am on-
board. Count me in.
We have other Senators. Not surpris-
ingly, we have former Governors. This
is how we had to operate. These were
our day-to-day operations. During the
crisis of 2007, 2008, I used to meet once
a week in West Virginia with my fi-
nance people. They would give me the
projections, and we had to make ad-
justments. In 2007 and 2008, with the re-
cession coming on as hard it was, we
were meeting twice a day, trying to
stay ahead of it and figure out how we
could keep from getting in the hole.
But we made it. I have never seen that
type of attention here. I have not seen
one Presidential candidate—right now
with all of them out there—talking
about the finances of our country,
talking about what the children of the
next generation will inherit, how they
are going to be able to manage, how
their mothers and their fathers and all
of them are going to have Social Secu-
rity secured and Medicare taken care
of. I haven’t heard that at all. Maybe
we can get the dialogue started now.

With that, I yield floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming.
APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I
come to the floor today to support the
funding bill for the defense of our Na-
tion. This funding package provides a
well-earned, well-deserved pay raise for
our troops—the men and women in uni-
form, the men and women I had the
privilege of visiting earlier this month,
part of the Wyoming National Guard
deployments in multiple places around
the world.
Yet Democrats have blocked a key
vote. They did it last month. I want to
make sure they don’t do it again. It
seems they are doing it for purely po-
litical reasons. It is a partisan block-
ade of our Nation’s troops’ pay raise. It
is hard to believe they are doing it, but
they did it, and it seems they want to
do it again.
Both parties agreed to support our
military, and they support our mili-
tary families as well. They made that
promise 3 months ago. Then they went
back on the promise. It was part of
that bipartisan budget deal that was
signed in August.
By moving this defense funding
measure, Republicans are keeping our
promises; the Democrats are breaking
theirs. Now it is time once again to
vote. It is time for Democrats to stop
blocking the bill. It is time to stop
playing politics, especially with our
troops’ paychecks.
We need to pass this bill to fully fund
the Defense Department. It honors our
commitment to our troops. It delivers
critical resources our military needs to
keep us safe, to keep us strong, to keep
us prosperous. The bill protects Amer-
ica’s standing among our allies and our
adversaries.
We need to get this done. It also
funds Health and Human Services.
That is what we are looking at as well.
It includes our Nation’s medical re-
search.
It is time for the Democrats to get to
yes. It is time to keep our promises to
the military; it is time to honor our
commitment to our troops; and it is
time to get on with the business of our
Nation. It is time to pass the bill.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRAMER). The clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRAMER). The Senator from Tennessee.
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
BOEING 737 MAX
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Thank you, Mr.
President.
We just heard Senators ROMNEY and
MANCHIN talking about our Nation’s
economic woes and legislation they are
handling on a bipartisan basis. I think
it is always a good and positive thing
when we can approach our work in a bi-
partisan way. It is what the American
people are expecting us to do.
Yesterday, in our Commerce,
Science, and Transportation Com-
mittee, we had bipartisanship at work
again. We were carrying out one of the
duties we have in Congress, which is to
conduct oversight and to make certain
that not only the processes of govern-
ment and the fiscal health of our gov-
ernment are on a firm footing but also
to look at things like consumer protec-
tion and public safety.
Our hearing yesterday dealt with
these deadly and disastrous crashes
that happened with the Boeing 737
MAX. We know that those crashes oc-
curred and remember that one occurred
in Indonesia and one in Ethiopia.
I will tell you that, in my opinion,
the executives from the Boeing Com-
pany tried—and they failed—to explain
to members of the Senate Commerce
Committee why they allowed the 737
MAX aircraft to reach the commercial
market.
We discovered that the company’s
highest echelon neglected a responsi-
bility to ensure that the aircraft met
their highest safety standards. It was
of concern to us. I don’t know, and I
think many of us were left trying to
figure out, whether this was something
that was a corporate culture problem,
whether it was a communication prob-
lem, or whether it was a negligence
issue.
Until a few weeks ago, executives, in-
cluding president and CEO Dennis
Muilenburg, had not read emails re-
vealing how Boeing officials convinced
the FAA to approve training materials
and delete troublesome flight systems
data and had not read text messages
showing that employees lied to regu-
lators about safety problems with the
plane’s MCAS system. That is the Ma-
neuvering Characteristics Augmenta-
tion System. They had not read the
text messages that spelled out there
was a problem.
When asked at the hearing for tech-
nical details on the science and sys-
tems behind the MAX’s approval,
Muilenburg and his cohort were unable
to even give a straight answer. We did
not get the answers we needed on ques-
tions about their process, test pilots,
or simulators.
Yesterday’s hearing made it clear
that Boeing leadership cannot provide
the answers we are looking for, not for
ourselves but on behalf of the victims
and their families and on behalf of the
flying public who, yes, safety is their
priority.
The Senate really needs to look at
this issue again. Our Commerce Com-
mittee should schedule another hearing
on the people and the procedures and
hear from the engineers and the test
pilots behind Boeing’s MAX program.
Perhaps these engineers and pilots
will be able to do a better job than the
executives did yesterday, and perhaps
they can explain to the families of
these 346 crash victims how so many
people ended up dead after choosing
one the world’s safest modes of trans-
portation.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
BLACKBURN). The Senator from North
Dakota.
Mr. CRAMER. Madam President,
first of all, thank you for your flexi-
bility at the chair today.
APPROPRIATIONS
Madam President, the purpose for
rising today is to advocate on behalf of
our military, the men and women who
are the bravest in the world. I feel com-
pelled to do so because I can imagine
that in these days of hyperpartisan pol-
itics, some of them may feel like some
of us are abandoning them, and I want
them to know for sure that we are not.
We all took an oath to the Constitu-
tion, and the highest priority in the
Constitution for the Federal Govern-
ment is, of course, to provide for the
Nation’s defense against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.
Unfortunately, my Democratic col-
leagues seem to be shirking from this
responsibility lately. They are willing
to settle for, seemingly, mediocrity,
and right now we have excellence, the
best. First of all, they are planning to
come to this Chamber tomorrow to
block the all-important Defense appro-
priations bill; that is to say, to block
the funding for our military; that is to
say, to block the largest pay increase
for the men and women of our military
in over a decade—just to name one
topic that is being funded, or would be
funded, by this appropriations bill that
they are going to block.
Back in July, the House and Senate,
on a bipartisan basis—I say to the Pre-
siding Officer, you just gave a wonder-
ful speech about the importance of
working together. On a bipartisan
basis, we passed a major budget bill. It
was a win for our military and a win
for our country because it was sup-
posed to provide them with certainty
and an important path forward as they
chart that path—that strategic path—
for America’s superiority.
To echo the House Speaker and the
Democratic leader at the time: ‘‘A bi-
partisan agreement has been reached
that will enhance our national secu-
rity.’’ These aren’t my words—al-
though I agree with them—these are
the words of the Democratic leadership
of Congress.
After passage, the Democratic leader
went on to say: This deal would
‘‘strengthen our national security and
provide our troops with the resources
they need.’’ I agree with the Demo-
cratic leader. Please—please—change
course while you still can and support
this important funding bill tomorrow.
I agreed with my colleague from New
York then, and I supported that legis-
lation for the exact reason to
‘‘strengthen our national security and
provide our troops with the resources
they need.’’
This deal passed with strong bipar-
tisan support. It was widely applauded.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6288 October 30, 2019
Yet here we are today, this week, with
our colleagues preparing to block the
funding for our troops for which they
were just a couple of months ago pat-
ting themselves on the back.
This whole process shouldn’t even be
this complicated. In fact, I am con-
vinced that the American people are
tired of us complicating simple things.
We agreed to this 2-year budget agree-
ment just a few months ago. I voted for
it. Party leadership pushed for it. The
President signed it. Then we voted for
a short-term continuing resolution to
get in order before getting to the final
appropriations deal.
I reluctantly voted for the short-
term CR, but the only thing worse than
a CR, of course, is a government shut-
down. So that was what we were con-
fronted with.
If one asked the military community
how they feel about continuing resolu-
tions, they would be quick to tell you
they don’t work. They don’t work at
all. They do not provide certainty be-
yond certainty. They don’t allow new
programs to be launched. They don’t
allow the pay increases that our appro-
priations bill does. So evidently it has
not been a priority for our Democratic
colleagues, but they do have priorities,
as we know.
This impeachment craziness, this ob-
session with eliminating, getting rid of
our Commander in Chief a year before
the election of the Commander in Chief
is what their priorities are, clearly, not
the priorities stated in the Constitu-
tion or that they were bragging about
a couple of months ago.
Of course, in addition, they are now
standing in the way of us passing the
reconciled National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act—the authorization that pro-
vides the guidance for these priorities
that are also part of our appropriations
bill.
We went through all of that, and for
what? I didn’t agree to the deals we
made or take these tough votes just so
the Democrats could block Defense ap-
propriations and leave our military
stuck with political gridlock that they
have imposed on us now.
By failing to pass this appropriations
bill, by standing in the way now of rec-
onciling in the conference committee
the National Defense Authorization
Act, they really are standing in the
way of our military. Now there is talk
of a ‘‘skinny NDAA’’—that is to say, a
watered-down skinny version.
For 58 years in a row, we have done
what you just talked about and what
the previous speakers talked about. We
have worked in a bipartisan way to
pass an NDAA 58 years in a row.
As the first North Dakotan ever to
sit on the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee, I treated this NDAA with the
utmost importance and still do. We
made some significant progress, from
nuclear deterrence to UAS develop-
ment, establishing a Space Force, and
honoring the sailors of the USS Frank
E. Evans—a provision the Democratic
leader and his colleague from New
York supported, I will add. Both the
House and Senate versions of the
NDAA advanced important policies for
my State, for our country, and really
for the world.
We should be working collaboratively
to combine these versions and pass the
best plan possible for our military. In-
stead, our work is being sacrificed at
the altar of partisan politics, caught up
in a partisan impeachment process
that makes no sense.
Let’s make something clear about
this skinny NDAA.
Our chairman is not introducing it
with haste or without great consider-
ation. He first warned that this could
happen well over a month ago. He said
it would happen if our Democratic col-
leagues proved to be so incapable of
setting aside their problems with
President Trump that they could not
advance the interests of our Nation’s
military. Ever the optimist, I thought
they would. I thought they would.
Now, my Democratic colleagues are
balking at any and all forward progress
on the NDAA because of their opposi-
tion to President Trump and his prior-
ities for border security. They want to
limit his authority to transfer any-
more funds in order to build physical
barriers at our southern border.
So I want to be clear. The President
would not need to use that authority to
use any military construction funds to
build a wall if our Democratic col-
leagues would simply provide the nec-
essary funding through the normal ap-
propriations process, as they always
have and as we always have. I, for one,
will not be so unreasonable in negoti-
ating with them. For example, if—and
I mean only if—my Democratic col-
leagues would fund the administra-
tion’s border security request through
the appropriations process, then count
me in for limiting the President’s
transfer authority. I am willing to
compromise, but you can’t have it both
ways. You can’t say we are going to
take away the President’s constitu-
tional authority on the one hand, and
then, on the other hand, make sure you
don’t fund the priorities that he needs
to fund, which is, again, the highest
priority of our government.
To reiterate my earlier point, I ap-
plaud the chairman for his handling of
this process. He has been vigilant and
focused on completing the NDAA, and I
don’t blame him for where we are
today. No, House Democrats have not
been willing partners and have forced
the chairman to devise a backup plan
for their intransigence.
That is what I find so disappointing.
Surely, our Democratic colleagues
know the threat that our foreign ad-
versaries pose. For crying out loud, we
just came from a classified briefing. If
it is not clear enough, I don’t know
when it will be.
Whether it is the crisis at the south-
ern border or the critical missions that
bring terrorists like al-Baghdadi to jus-
tice, I am sure my colleagues want to
do whatever it takes to keep our coun-
try safe. Surely, they are capable of
putting partisan politics aside in order
to pass the 59th straight National De-
fense Authority Act. Anything to the
contrary would be unprecedented.
Yet here we are. I find it astonishing
that with all the wannabe Commanders
in Chief right here in the Senate, they
are playing politics with the funding
and authorities of the troops they hope
to lead.
Can you imagine one of these Presi-
dential candidates becoming the Com-
mander in Chief and the first talk they
have with the troops is, ‘‘Yeah, I held
up your funding and your pay raises.’’
It is not a great way to start.
If it were up to our committee, this
bill would have already passed. If it
were up to our conference, this NDAA
would be on its way to the President’s
desk. But unfortunately, it is not. That
is the unfortunate reality we face
today.
The Democratic Party is continuing
to put their hatred of President Trump
and his agenda above the needs of our
Nation’s military, and, thus, our Na-
tion’s defense. It is a dereliction of
duty. I find it sickening, and I find it
embarrassing. We are better than this.
This institution deserves better than
this. The American people expect and
deserve better than this.
I want to make one last plea before
they block tomorrow’s vote. Please put
our military men and women, our high-
est priority, ahead of partisan politics.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRAMER). Without objection, it is so or-
dered.
SOUTH SUDAN
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will
talk just for a very few minutes today
about something that has been on my
mind and on my heart. We so easily
forget how fortunate we are to live in
a country like America. I wish all of
our world’s neighbors were as fortunate
as we are, but they are not. We can’t
lose sight of that fact. I don’t know
why bad things happen to good people,
and I am not suggesting that I have a
complete solution to it, but trying to
understand it is at least a good first
step.
I am talking about the ongoing crisis
in South Sudan. As you know, South
Sudan is a landlocked country in East-
Central Africa, and it is a fairly new
country. In the 7 years since South
Sudan was plunged into a very bloody
civil war, not only have millions of
people been displaced from their
homes, but over 400,000—think about
that—men, women, and children have
been killed in the crossfire—400,000.
I would like nothing more than for
the recent negotiated ceasefire be-
tween the government and the rebels

to hold. We all would. But if we are
being honest, we have to express our
sincere doubts. I don’t have any doubt
that the people of South Sudan yearn
for peace.
Unfortunately, there are some who
are taking advantage of the sad situa-
tion in South Sudan. They are taking
advantage of South Sudan’s conflicts
and widespread corruption within its
government in order to steal the na-
tion’s and the people’s natural re-
sources. I am talking about
kleptocrats. I am talking about war
criminals. I am talking about corrupt
multinational corporations that are
pilfering South Sudan’s natural re-
sources, regardless of the chaos that
they are causing and the extraordinary
human cost.
Until good people in this world take
a stand and say enough is enough, the
people in South Sudan will continue to
be at the mercy of the corrupt. The
predatory extraction of South Sudan’s
resources not only directs vital capital
outside of the war-torn nation, where
it is desperately needed inside, but it
makes meaningful investment in sus-
tained peace simply impossible.
That is why I am respectfully calling
on the U.S. Senate to stand with peace,
to stand with right—not with might,
with right—and to stand with the peo-
ple of South Sudan. The people of
South Sudan are a proud people. They
are a resilient people. They are tired of
being ruled by a government that is
ripe with corruption. They are tired of
seeing their nation torn apart by war.
The U.S. Senate ought to condemn the
marauding, the stealing of resources,
and the widespread corruption within
the South Sudanese Government. Fur-
thermore, I also call on the United
States to support sanctions against
those companies and those individuals
outside of South Sudan that continue
to profit off of the ongoing conflicts
and instability in the region.
Now, we are a powerful nation. I just
listened to your very eloquent talk
about the men and women in our mili-
tary who protect our country. Not only
do we have the world’s most powerful
military, but let me put it another
way. We have the most powerful mili-
tary in all of human history. We also
have the strongest economy the world
has ever seen, and for that, we were
blessed.
It is the latter that we have to wield
against the internal and the external
bad actors taking advantage of the peo-
ple of South Sudan. Much like our
sanctions against the largest state
sponsor of terrorism in the world—I
am, of course, talking about Iran—and
much like those sanctions have re-
sulted in a successful economic pres-
sure campaign, I hope the same can be
done, targeting crooked government
officials and the unethical multi-
national corporations that target vul-
nerable nations like South Sudan.
It has been well documented that
there are a number of multinational
corporations with ties to nations like
China and nations like Malaysia that
have taken advantage of widespread
corruption in the region, in South
Sudan and the surrounding region, to
spur their own economic and political
gain. It has been reported and it has
been independently verified that one of
South Sudan’s largest multinational
petroleum consortiums from outside
the country operating in the country, a
company called Dar Petroleum Oper-
ating Company, has actively funded
militia and paramilitary groups within
the region.
In fact, when Dar Petroleum isn’t
funding militia or brokering weapons
deals, it keeps busy polluting local
communities in South Sudan and water
supplies with its industrial waste. The
petroleum company has dumped ‘‘high
levels of heavy metals and dangerous
chemical compounds’’ into the sur-
rounding countryside with no regard—
none, zero, no regard—for local popu-
lations.
In fact, the contamination from the
joint Chinese-Malaysian-owned cor-
poration has extended well beyond
merely the soil surrounding Dar Petro-
leum’s production and processing
plants. The soil contamination is found
to be so widespread and so extensive
that over 600,000 of the good people in
South Sudan are expected to be af-
fected by it.
From bribery to pollution and even
murder, these unsavory actors have
found a home in South Sudan, ruining
the environment and raping the nat-
ural resources of the country, and they
are going to continue to find a safe
haven and continue business unless we
act.
Unless sanctions against countries
and individuals that are known to have
long taken advantage of South Sudan’s
weak or almost nonexistent rule of law
are implemented, stability in the re-
gion is going to be nothing but a dream
and nothing but happy talk.
The United States should not remain
silent as untold billions are stolen. The
monies are being stolen, and the nat-
ural resources are being stolen from
the people in South Sudan. The people
of South Sudan are also being mur-
dered in the process.
We should not stand by. By empow-
ering the U.S. Government to target
the illicit financial activity that serves
as the root cause for many of the
atrocities that I have talked about, the
South Sudanese can begin rebuilding
their nation without fear of violence
and without fear of corruption. The
United States is far from the only gov-
ernment on the world stage that has
the ability to do this. Now, we both
know that, but as is so often the case,
we might be the only government with
the will and the moral conviction to do
what is right.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask

APPROPRIATIONS
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise
today to speak about the importance of
the Senate providing the resources
needed by our soldiers, sailors, airmen,
and marines.
We are seeing increasing threats to
the homeland from around the world.
We need look no further than the re-
cent elimination of Abu Bakr al-
Baghdadi by U.S. Special Operations
forces to show us that there are evil
people out there who continue to de-
vote their lives to killing American
citizens and glorifying the fall of our
Nation. The rise of ISIS proved that
radical terrorist ideologies remain dan-
gerous. Despite the elimination of its
leader, groups like ISIS will continue
to remain a serious challenge across
the globe.
We have also seen the emergence of a
great power competition with China
and Russia. They are investing massive
amounts of resources to erode the
international order that the United
States and our allies have worked so
hard to create and protect. Leaders of
these nations don’t want societies
based on liberty and free enterprise; in-
stead, they are focused on promoting
the iron precepts of authoritarianism
and autocracy. Without American en-
gagement and a strong investment in
the Nation’s military, our children
could live in a world transformed by
these malign forces. We cannot allow
that to happen.
Clearly, the threats we face abroad
are increasing. On that fact, we have
bipartisan support. These past few
weeks, many of my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle have spoken
about the situation in Syria and the
danger that an expansionist Russia
poses to nations like Ukraine. We agree
about the need for the United States to
address these challenges, but I am not
convinced that my Democratic col-
leagues are truly serious about sus-
taining American leadership and re-
taining our position in the world. If
they are, it is time to show it by ad-
vancing the defense funding legisla-
tion.
Funding the military in a timely,
predictable fashion is one of the most
important things we can do in Con-
gress. A failure to do so awards China
and Russia with an advantage at a
time when we can least afford it. We
need to work together to pass our De-
fense appropriations bill for the com-
ing fiscal year and to focus on imple-
menting the National Defense Strategy
to effectively confront these threats.
It is also worth highlighting how
many provisions contained in this bill
are absolutely critical to our military.
This legislation provides significant in-
vestments in both basic research and
future technologies to allow for contin-
ued innovation within DOD. It includes

areas pivotal to implementing the
goals of the NDS, including
hypersonics, 5G, artificial intelligence,
missile defense, and cyber security.
Importantly, it provides robust fund-
ing for all three legs of the triad and
appropriates funding to enable the
modernization of our Nation’s nuclear
deterrent. There is no question that
this is a top priority of mine as chair-
man of the Strategic Forces Sub-
committee of the Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee.
In addition, we cannot forget that
the Department of Defense still has not
recovered from the impacts of several
natural disasters that affected multiple
installations across the country. This
includes Offutt Air Force Base and
Camp Ashland in my own State of Ne-
braska, as well as several others. With-
out the relief funding in the Defense
appropriations bill, these bases and
their tenant units will not be able to
fully recover from these disasters. That
poses a major threat not just to the
bases themselves but to all of the mis-
sions we rely upon them to support.
For that reason, it is critical that we
move forward with the defense funding
process to allow full recovery to take
place at these bases.
All of us here also recognize that our
military is about more than hardware;
it is our men and women in uniform
and their families who make our
Armed Forces strong. That is why it is
so essential that we provide the pay
and benefits that are critical for our
servicemembers and their families. The
Defense appropriations bill delivers a
military pay increase of 3.1 percent.
That is the largest in a decade.
If we are truly serious about sup-
porting our warfighters, if we mean
what we say when we talk about sup-
porting the troops, then step up. We
must move forward with the Defense
appropriations bill. Now is the not the
time to put political grandstanding
ahead of serious legislating.
I hope we can look back at the Sen-
ate’s bipartisan tradition of uniting be-
hind the common defense as inspira-
tion. Let’s take up and pass the De-
fense appropriations bill. In doing so,
we honor our commitment to Amer-
ica’s warfighters.
We have seen over the past week how
the bravery and commitment of our
servicemembers can deliver the world’s
most-wanted terrorist to justice. We
must honor their service and the serv-
ice of all our men and women in uni-
form by moving this process forward.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to
sound the alarm on the Trump admin-
istration’s expected announcement of
its withdrawal of the United States
from the Paris Agreement within the
United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change to reduce global
greenhouse gas emissions in an effort
to limit global temperature increase in
this century to 2 degrees Celsius above
preindustrial levels, while pursuing
means to limit it even further to 1.5 de-
grees.
Article 28 of the Paris Agreement
that was entered into in COP 21 2015
specifies that after joining, no country
can withdraw for 3 years, after which a
1-year waiting period must occur be-
fore the withdrawal takes effect. The
United States entered into this historic
agreement on November 4, 2016; thus,
the earliest date the United States can
initiate withdrawal is November 4,
2019. After the U.S. files withdrawal
documents, the 1-year waiting period
begins, making November 4, 2020, the
earliest possible date the United States
can fully—and I might add, reck-
lessly—get out of this agreement.
I urge my colleagues to support a
Senate resolution that I certainly will
be filing expressing our need for U.S.
climate diplomacy. Withdrawal is ter-
rible. The cost of inaction is high.
For example, in my State of Mary-
land, by the year 2100, climate change
could force the Navy to relocate the
U.S. Naval Academy from where it has
made its home in Annapolis, MD, since
1845.
Surrounded by water on three sides,
the Naval Academy is especially vul-
nerable to sea rise. The Severn River
runs along the east, Spa Creek extends
to the south, and College Creek runs
along the north. Parts of the academy
adjacent to the water stand 3 feet
above the waterline. Sea levels around
Annapolis have risen about 1 foot over
the past 100 years. The Naval Academy
is only one of scores of U.S. military
bases that may be inundated by rising
seas.
Unlike this administration, the acad-
emy is taking action. In 2015, the Sea
Level Rise Advisory Council formed to
create an adaptation plan and make de-
cisions about flood-related matters.
Staff are installing door dams and
flood barriers on doorways, repairing
seawalls, and installing backflow pre-
venters in storm drain systems to re-
duce funding. Newly constructed build-
ings will have elevated entrances and
limited first-floor openings to keep ris-
ing water out. But these actions have
high costs that are compounded by in-
action.
On October 12 of this year, a com-
bination of seasonal high tides, a full
Moon, and a tropical storm stalled off
the eastern seaboard caused a ‘‘nui-
sance flood’’ in downtown Annapolis,
disrupting the festivities at the annual
Annapolis Boat Show, flooding booths
at the city dock and closing streets.
One week later, the Chesapeake Bay
Foundation—the key nonprofit partner
in the restoration effort—announced
that it will close the Fox Island Edu-
cation Center due to subsidence and
rising sea levels—a casualty of our fail-
ure to address climate change. For the
past 40 years, the Fox Center has
helped educate students on the impor-
tance of a healthy Chesapeake Bay wa-
tershed. Environmental literacy is an
essential goal of the Chesapeake Bay
Watershed Agreement, and institutions
like the Fox Island Center serve a key
role.
The marshes and wetlands the foun-
dation is dedicated to protecting are
among Maryland’s best natural de-
fenses in mitigating the effects of cli-
mate-related impacts like more fre-
quent storms and rising sea levels. The
untimely closure is a reminder of the
very real presence of changes to the
bay in our communities and the urgent
need to prepare.
On October 17, the Federal Reserve
Bank of San Francisco released a re-
port. The collection of 18 papers by
outside experts amounts to one of the
most specific and dire accountings of
the dangers posed to businesses and
communities in the United States—a
threat so significant that the Nation’s
central banks are increasingly com-
pelled to act.
Climate change has begun to affect
the real estate market, according to a
paper by Asaf Bernstein, an economist
at the University of Colorado in Boul-
der. His research shows that properties
likely to be underwater if the seas rise
1 foot now sell for 15 percent less than
comparable properties with no flood
threat.
Our failure to act on climate change
has a real economic impact on Amer-
ican families. Coastal cities are al-
ready unable to pay for the types of
projects that could prevent them from
the growing effects of climate change.
On October 23, in a briefing for the
Maryland Senate Education, Health,
and Environmental Affairs Committee,
NOAA oceanographer Will Sweet said
that Annapolis is on pace for another
record-breaking year in 2019, with 10
high-tide flood days so far.
By 2030, there could be between 15
and 25 high-tide flood days a year. By
2050, that number could rise to between
50 and 170. That compares to how it was
at the turn of the century when we
only had two such events in a year.
This is not only a coastal issue. In
addition to an update from NOAA, the
committee heard from officials in How-
ard County—Howard County, I would
state, is a landlocked county in Mary-
land—about their plan to mitigate
flooding in Ellicott City, 35 miles in-
land from Annapolis, where flash-flood-
ing has claimed the lives of three peo-
ple since 2016. Officials discussed their
$140 million plan, which includes de-
molishing some buildings and con-
structing a tunnel 15 feet in diameter,
80 to 100 feet deep, and 1,600 feet long
on the north side of the city’s Main
Street. The tunnel would divert about
two-thirds of the floodwaters.
It is an expensive project. Will it
keep Ellicott City safe? It will keep it
safer, but the threat will still be there
because of our inaction as far as deal-
ing with climate change. That is $140
million we would not need to find as
fast if we were slowing the rate of sea
level rise; that is, if we were reducing
the use of carbon emissions in accord-
ance with the Paris Agreement.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6291
October 30, 2019
Many small business owners took out
loans in 2016 and 2018 from the Depart-
ment of Housing and Community De-
velopment and are struggling to repay
them. These are not international com-
petitors with an agenda being hurt by
inaction on climate change; these are
local residents, constituents, Ameri-
cans.
We need to act.
I am proud to lead bipartisan legisla-
tion to help critical water infrastruc-
ture adapt to natural hazards. We need
to do adaptation. I am for that, and it
is bipartisan in this Chamber, but ad-
aptation mitigation must go hand in
hand, from the local to the inter-
national level.
I led the congressional delegation to
COP 21 with nine of our colleagues in
the U.S. Senate. We had a delegation
10-strong in Paris at COP 21 in 2015
when the United States agreed to lower
its gas emissions 26 to 28 percent below
the 2005 levels by 2025. Entering the
25th conference of the parties, U.S. car-
bon dioxide emissions rose an esti-
mated 3.4 percent in 2018—a spike that
comes as reports like the Fourth Na-
tional Climate Assessment and the
IPCC special report tell us the world
needs to be aggressively cutting its
emissions to avoid the most dev-
astating effects of climate change. The
findings, published by the independent
economic research firm Rhodium
Group, mean that our Nation now has a
diminishing chance of meeting the
pledge it made in Paris. This is a hor-
rible embarrassment for our country,
which was once a global leader on cli-
mate change. When the United States
doesn’t lead, other countries are going
to step in and take over that leader-
ship, as we have seen with regard to
China stepping forward in regard to cli-
mate issues. China should be the
United States.
I urge this administration to reassert
strong leadership in implementing the
Paris Agreement. I urge the Senate to
act to return America’s leadership to
this critical global challenge.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent to speak for up
to 20 minutes as in morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I
am thrilled and delighted to follow my
outstanding colleague from Maryland
coming here to talk about climate
change. That is the topic that brings
me to the floor today as well. Those of
us who are from coastal States not
only have the experience of worse
flooding in our coastal communities
and those coastal communities getting
new conversations with their munic-
ipal bond folks about what the flooding
risk means for their bond ratings, but
we are also looking at projections like
Maryland is of what happens if we
don’t act, and the very maps of our
State will change.
When historians look back at why
the United States failed so badly to
take on climate change, they will, of
course, focus on the political efforts of
the world’s largest oil companies:
Exxon, Chevron, BP, and Shell. They
will note the obstructive role of lead-
ing trade associations like the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, the National
Association of Manufacturers, and the
American Petroleum Institute. They
will chronicle the network of phony
front groups set up by Big Oil, Big
Coal, and the Koch brothers to sow
doubt of the science and fear of climate
action. Big Oil, the Kochs, the trade as-
sociations, the front groups all will de-
serve plenty of blame. Their climate
denial apparatus and their capture of
the modern Republican Party is a di-
rect and deliberate cause of America’s
failure.
There are other less heralded but
equally bad actors. I come to the floor
today to discuss one of them. Future
historians of ‘‘anii Trumpi,’’ take note
of Marathon Petroleum. Marathon Pe-
troleum is the largest oil refiner in the
United States. It refines oil into gaso-
line, other fuels, and lubricants. It
owns pipelines and gas stations. Its
4,000 Speedway locations and almost
8,000 independent gas stations selling
Marathon-branded fuels reach across
the country. It is No. 31 on the Fortune
500 list of U.S. companies, and it has
almost $100 billion in annual revenue.
This is a big company with a big stake
in blocking climate action.
What does Marathon want? Well, its
annual report filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission makes one
thing very clear: Marathon sees laws
and regulations that reduce carbon pol-
lution as a threat. One threat Mara-
thon specifically cites in its annual re-
port is fuel economy or CAFE stand-
ards. Why? Marathon’s 2018 annual re-
port reads: ‘‘Higher CAFE standards
for cars and light trucks have the po-
tential to reduce demand for our trans-
portation fuels.’’ It is as simple as
that. Fuel-efficient cars burn less gas,
and that is bad for a big refiner.
Well, in 2012, automakers and the
State of California and the previous ad-
ministration got together, and they
agreed to significantly better fuel
economy standards. That was a good
deal for almost everyone. Consumers
were estimated to save more than $1.7
trillion in reduced fuel costs—up to
$8,000 per vehicle for vehicles purchased
in 2025. The air would be cleaner. Car-
bon emissions from cars and light
trucks would be cut in half by 2025, and
automakers would have a competitive
spur to keep pace with new vehicle
technologies being developed in Europe
and China—win, win, win, win.
Well, in 2017, these automakers came
back into the Trump administration
and asked the Trump administration to
revisit the fuel economy standards. It
looks, from everything I have seen,
like the auto industry primarily want-
ed technical changes to make the
standards easier to meet. I have found
no evidence that the auto industry
asked the administration to totally
freeze the standards or that they asked
the administration then to revoke Cali-
fornia’s authority to set its own stand-
ards under the Clean Air Act.
When automakers asked the adminis-
tration for these changes, someone else
was watching. The oil industry sensed
opportunity. The standards may have
been good for consumers, the auto in-
dustry, States, our global climate, but
that $1.7 trillion in reduced fuel costs
that consumers would save would come
directly out of oil industry revenues.
So the oil industry sprang into action
to hijack the rulemaking process.
The oil industry demanded weak-
ening of the standards to the max; i.e.,
a freeze, and it even demanded revoca-
tion of California’s longstanding au-
thority to set its own standards, lead-
ing more than a dozen other States, in-
cluding my home State of Rhode Is-
land. We follow the California stand-
ard. An administration marbled
through with fossil fuel lobbyists and
attorneys heard the oil industry call. It
must have been a strange experience
for the automakers. One minute they
are asking for technical changes to a
regulation they had agreed to; the next
minute the whole process has been run
off with by a completely other indus-
try.
Marathon was the ring leader. I ob-
tained an electronic draft of a letter to
the Deputy Administrator of the Na-
tional Highway Traffic Safety Admin-
istration urging her to weaken the fuel
economy standards. The metadata of
the letter was still in the letter be-
cause I got it electronically. According
to the metadata in this document, it
was written by a Marathon Petroleum
inhouse lobbyist. Marathon then
shopped this letter around to Members
of the House of Representatives to con-
vince them to send letters backing the
weakened standards that they wanted.
We got those House letters, and we
ran them through plagiarism software
against the Marathon lobbyists’ draft.
Here is what we got. When we com-
pared the Marathon letter with the let-
ter sent by Members of Pennsylvania’s
congressional delegation, it was an 80-
percent match. The red here is all the
language that is identical. Members
from Indiana and West Virginia sent
similar letters also with text lifted di-
rectly from the Marathon lobbyists’
draft. If you want to give this political
stunt a name, you could call it a Pru-
itt, after Scott Pruitt, who distin-
guished himself for the Trump EPA Ad-
ministrator’s position by copying a
Devon Energy text onto his own offi-
cial letterhead as attorney general of
his State and sending it on as if it were
his letter.
Back to Marathon. Pulling a Pruitt
with these Congressmen was not
enough. We know from Marathon’s own
reports that it directly lobbied on the
standards, and we know that its trade
association, the American Fuel and Pe-
trochemical Manufacturers, AFPM,

S6292 October 30, 2019
also lobbied on the standards. We know
AFPM also launched a campaign on so-
cial media urging people to support a
freeze.
Marathon is a member of a front
group that is called the American Leg-
islative Exchange Council, also known
as ALEC. This front group pushes the
agenda of the Koch brothers’ apparatus
in State legislatures. It is the tool for
the Koch brothers to try to work their
will in State legislatures. ALEC passed
a resolution in favor of weakening the
standards and revoking California’s
State authority. We know that senior
executives from Marathon met person-
ally with EPA leadership and with sen-
ior officials in the White House to push
for weakening the standards and revok-
ing California’s authority.
There is a lot we don’t know. We
don’t know which front groups Mara-
thon and other oil companies fund be-
cause neither of them disclose their do-
nations or their donors. We don’t know
how many other groups were deployed
in this effort. We don’t know the ex-
tent to which Marathon coordinated its
campaign with the trade association
and the front groups, so we can’t assess
whether this lobbying effort violated
the front groups’ 501(c)(3) tax-exempt
status. We don’t know what role Mara-
thon or its front groups had in the
mysterious antitrust letter that came
popping out of DOJ shortly after the
automakers negotiated separately with
California.
When the automakers realized that
their negotiations—the process they
were involved with—had been hijacked
by Marathon and that they were just
passengers on the Marathon train at
this point, they bailed. When they
knew the conversation was bogus, they
bailed. They negotiated directly with
California, and they came up with their
own deal with California. That, obvi-
ously, really ticked off the oil guys
who thought they had this thing all
scoped. Apparently, it even ticked off
the President—all the way up to Presi-
dent Trump.
The next thing you know comes this
truly bizarre letter out of DOJ that ap-
pears to ignore basic tenets of anti-
trust law, like when you are negoti-
ating with a State government, it is
not an antitrust violation. It appears
also to violate DOJ’s own very elabo-
rate antitrust investigation proce-
dures.
So who pulled those strings? We
don’t know. More broadly, if Marathon
and other fossil fuel companies are pur-
posefully paying a web of phony front
groups and trade associations to spread
deliberate, known disinformation
about climate change in order to ob-
struct climate action in Congress, does
that not warrant congressional inves-
tigation? Might it not, in fact, be
fraud? It was fraud when the tobacco
industry did it.
Over the past 2 weeks, two different
subcommittees of the House Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform held
hearings that examined how the fossil
fuel industry deploys front groups and
trade associations to spread
disinformation about climate change
and block legislative action.
Yesterday the Senate Democrats’
Special Committee on the Climate Cri-
sis held our hearing on how dark
money front groups hide the industry’s
role in climate denial and legislative
obstruction. Fat chance we will have
Senate committees investigate this
masquerade in a Chamber under Repub-
lican control, but for our friends in the
House, the time is ripe for congres-
sional oversight. Follow the money and
the facts wherever they lead. Let the
subpoenas fly.
Congressmen Henry Waxman led a
successful investigation of lies and de-
ceit from a corrupting industry, Big
Tobacco, and that precedent served our
country well. It served the American
public well. It ended up likely saving
lives.
So we go back to Marathon again.
Marathon’s shareholders are inter-
esting, too, in all of this.
Last month, 200 major investors who
had $6.5 trillion in assets under man-
agement, sent a letter to 47 U.S. com-
panies, including Marathon, urging
that the companies’ lobbying align
with the Paris Agreement’s goal of
global average temperature increase
below 2 degrees Celsius and warning
the companies that lobbying against
that goal is an investment risk.
The letter went to Marathon, but, in-
terestingly, none of Marathon’s biggest
investors—BlackRock, Vanguard,
State Street, and J.P. Morgan Asset
Management—signed the letter. Collec-
tively, these four investors own, rough-
ly, 25 percent of Marathon. BlackRock
lists climate risk as one of its engage-
ment priorities in 2019, so it says.
BlackRock published a report this year
that by 2060, 58 percent of U.S. metro
areas will see annual average climate-
related losses of at least 1 percent of
GDP, with some projected to lose a
staggering 15 percent of GDP.
JPMorgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, has
said: ‘‘Business must play a leadership
role in creating solutions that protect
the environment and grow the econ-
omy.’’
So it was interesting yesterday, in
our Senate select committee hearing,
to have a witness put up this slide.
This slide shows the positions on cli-
mate change, regulation, and the legis-
lation of a number of companies. It is
a spectrum. Green is supporting cli-
mate regulation and legislation. Oppo-
sition is red.
We were talking about the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, which has been
identified as one of the two worst cli-
mate obstructors in America as a trade
association. The U.S. Chamber and the
National Association of Manufacturers
take the prize. We were looking at how
strange that is because their member-
ships don’t have the positions they
take. So we are going to continue to
explore why it is that the board mem-
bers of the National Association of
Manufacturers and the board members
of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ap-
pear to have let their organizations be
run away with by the fossil fuel indus-
try as well.
Here is what was notable. On this
graph, this is where the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce is—one of the worst cli-
mate obstructors. Yet look who is
worse. In fact, look at who is the worst
of all of them—Marathon. What do you
know? You have these four investors
who own 25 percent of this company
that is on the worst side of this spec-
trum. They claim to care about solving
the climate problem. Yet they are 25-
percent owners in the most opposed of
all of these entities to the solution to
the climate crisis they claim to seek.
They have to get their act together.
It is not fair to be JPMorgan CEO
Jamie Dimon and say that business
must play a leadership role in creating
solutions that protect the environment
and grow the economy and then to be
part of the 25-percent largest share-
holders of the company that is the
worst of this.
You have to line this up, guys. You
can’t say one thing to the public and
then do the opposite through the com-
panies you own.
The stakes here are high. There are
credible warnings of a carbon asset
bubble and of crashes in coastal prop-
erty values, but BlackRock hasn’t in-
troduced a single climate-related
shareholder resolution since 2001. In
2018, BlackRock and Vanguard—two of
these big Marathon owners—voted in
favor of only 10 and 12 percent of cli-
mate-related shareholder resolutions.
They say they are good at this—
BlackRock 10 percent, Vanguard 12 per-
cent. The other ones, they didn’t sup-
port. In 2017, at Marathon—the worst—
BlackRock voted against a shareholder
proposal for Marathon to test its busi-
ness operations against the 2-degree
Celsius threshold that BlackRock
claimed to target and support. By the
way, if BlackRock had voted its shares
for this proposal, it would have passed.
Just this month, Marathon finally
published a report that examines its
own prospects in a carbon-contained
world. In one scenario, demand for pe-
troleum-based liquids plummets 26 per-
cent by 2040. With the demand for vehi-
cle fuels—Marathon’s primary mar-
ket—it falls even more steeply. If Mar-
athon estimates the market for its
main product could shrink by one-third
or more, first, you can understand why
it got in there to manipulate the auto
fuel efficiency standard process. You
can also understand why it is that
economists and sovereign banks are
issuing these warnings about a carbon
bubble.
We will get serious about climate
change. We must. We have no choice.
The costs of inaction are, as Donald
Trump once said, catastrophic.
Eventually, all of the fossil fuel
money and bullying in the world will
not stave off action in the face of
mounting climate calamities. This

should be obvious to everyone and cer-
tainly to sophisticated investors with
supposedly good climate policies like
BlackRock and JPMorgan. So why
aren’t they pushing Marathon to adapt
to a low-carbon economy? Why are
they happy to own 25 percent of that—
of the worst? That is what they want
to own?
It doesn’t have to be this way. Look
at DSM, a Dutch multinational, with
roughly $10 billion in revenues and over
23,000 employees around the world, in-
cluding many here in the United
States. DSM began as a coal mining
company over a century ago. Its lead-
ers realized coal mining in the Nether-
lands would someday end, so they re-
invented the company. When the last
mine closed in the 1970s, DSM had di-
versified. It is, today, a vibrant pro-
ducer of nutritional additives for food,
of pharmaceuticals, and of high-tech
materials for electronics, automobiles,
and construction. By contrast, Murray
Coal, which is an American coal min-
ing company that did not diversify,
filed for bankruptcy this week.
To the fossil fuel industry, I say that
you ought to begin adapting now. You
can’t ignore what is coming at you.
You owe it to your shareholders, and
you owe it to your employees. By God,
you owe it to your children.
To BlackRock and the other big in-
vestors, this means you have to pay at-
tention too. You say you are for cli-
mate action. Show that you mean it.
Demand change at Marathon and at
other fossil fuel companies that you
own. Start with mandating that these
companies disclose their climate ob-
struction funding. There is no excuse
for that to be secret.
If they will not do it, Congress, let’s
investigate. We have slept through this
mess long enough—in a state of in-
duced narcolepsy. We have sleepwalked
for far too long. It is time we woke up.
I yield the floor.

The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

REMEMBERING KAY HAGAN
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the
passing of former Senator Kay Hagan
was sad news to all of us who were priv-
ileged to serve with her and counted
her as a friend.
In her final address to the Senate 5
years ago, Senator Kay Hagan re-
minded us of our obligation to work to-
gether on behalf of the American peo-
ple with these words: ‘‘To whom much
is given, much is expected.’’
Kay Hagan was given much. She had
the energy, intelligence, dedication,
and compassion, and she gave back to
her home State over many years of
public service. As a person of deep
faith, she fully understood the New
Testament ‘‘Parable of the Talents.’’
Its message that gifts must be put to
use in service of others guided her life.
In this time of sorrow, I offer my
deep condolences to Kay’s family. I
hope that they will find comfort in
knowing that Kay left an inspiring leg-
acy. She left the world a better place
for her service. The loss felt by the peo-
ple of North Carolina and by her fam-
ily, in particular, is felt by people
throughout America.
I was privileged to serve with Kay for
6 years. We served together on the Sen-
ate Armed Services Committee, and I
always appreciated her focus on solu-
tions rather than partisan advantage.
She was passionate about many issues,
particularly those affecting children.
In 2011, Kay and I introduced legisla-
tion to commemorate the work at the
March of Dimes by minting a coin to
celebrate the 75th anniversary of this
organization and directing the proceeds
to the March of Dimes Prematurity
Campaign. As the author of the New-
born Screening Saves Lives Reauthor-
ization Act, Kay reaffirmed her belief
that we in Congress must always re-
member whom we are advocating for.
When Kay took office in 2009, she was
very proud to be one of 17 Senators who
were female. It is significant that her
very first speech on the Senate floor
that January was in support of the
Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to
strengthen protections for women
against wage discrimination.
It was so refreshing to hear her as-
sert that neither party had a monopoly
on good ideas. Throughout her time in
this Chamber, she proved the truth of
that maxim.
In the ‘‘Parable of the Talents,’’ the
master leaves on a journey and en-
trusts a servant with a portion of his
treasure. Upon his return, the master
is delighted to find that his wealth has
been wisely invested and multiplied.
Kay Hagan was entrusted with the
great treasure of principles, determina-
tion, and spirit. She invested that
treasure wisely and multiplied its ben-
efits for all. Like the master in the
Parable, to Kay Hagan we say: ‘‘Well
done, good and faithful servant.’’
May God bless her and her family and
may we all keep her memory in our
hearts.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am
about to offer the managers’ package
for the four appropriations bills cur-
rently before us: Commerce, Justice,
Science, Agriculture, Interior and the
Transportation, Housing, and Urban
Development bill. This managers’
package includes 45 amendments, many
of which—indeed, most of which—have
been offered on a bipartisan basis. They
have been cleared by both sides.
The Appropriations Committee has
worked very hard with Members to ac-
commodate as many amendments as
possible. For the T-HUD appropriations
bill, for example, both Senator JACK
REED and I worked to review, approve,
and clear managers’ amendments in
our part of the bill.
This package reflects a positive step
forward as we move toward final pas-
sage of this appropriations bill. It is
imperative that we move these bills
and go to conference with the House.
Therefore, I urge all Members to sup-
port this managers’ package.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that it be in order to offer the fol-
lowing amendments: Lee amendment
No. 1209 and Jones amendment No. 1141,
as modified. I further ask unanimous
consent that no second-degree amend-
ments be in order to these amendments
prior to the votes, and that at 11:30
a.m. on Thursday, October 31, the Sen-
ate vote in relation to these amend-
ments in the order listed.
Finally, I ask unanimous consent
that upon resumption of the bill on
Thursday, October 31, the following
amendments be called up and agreed to
en bloc, and the motions to reconsider
be considered made and laid upon the
table: Tester amendment No. 953;
Smith amendment No. 1023; Hirono

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF MOUNT
SINAI HOSPITAL
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Mount
Sinai Hospital opened its doors in 1919
as a place where Jewish physicians
could train and treat the immigrant
community of Chicago’s West Side.
Founded by Lithuanian Jewish immi-
grant Morris Kurtzon, Mount Sinai
kept its mission as a community hos-
pital even as it evolved into a regional
medical trauma center. This month,
Sinai celebrates a century of helping
everyone who come through its doors.
In the late 19th and early 20th cen-
turies, German and Eastern European
Jews immigrated to Chicago by the
thousands, fleeing religious persecu-
tion. Chicago lacked quality
healthcare for these immigrants, espe-
cially in Chicago’s South and West
Sides.
Maimonides Kosher Hospital of Chi-
cago opened in 1912 to fill the
healthcare gap, particularly the lack of
kosher hospitals, and to serve this im-
migrant community. However,
Maimonides struggled financially and
closed after only four years.
Morris Kurtzon, a board member of
Maimonides, was determined to keep
the dream alive. Kurtzon was born in
Lithuania in the 1870s and came to Chi-
cago as a child. Before the end of the
century, he established the Garden
City Plating and Manufacturing Com-
pany. He was a pillar of the commu-
nity, and with his $50,000 contribution,
Maimonides Kosher Hospital reopened
as Mount Sinai in 1919.
Within 5 years under Kurtzon’s lead-
ership, Mount Sinai had five floors, a
nursing school, and had grown from 60
to 220 beds.
Kurtzon retired in 1950, but the hos-
pital continued its growth. Mount
Sinai established what is now the old-
est home healthcare program in the
State of Illinois in 1953. It became a
major community anchor as the larg-
est employer in Lawndale.
Mount Sinai established the Mid-
west’s first in-vitro fertilization clinic
in 1983. The following year, the Mid-
west’s first rehabilitation hospital,
Schwab Rehabilitation Hospital, be-
came part of Mount Sinai. Today, it is
among the Nation’s top programs for
physical medicine and rehabilitation.
In 2012, Mount Sinai found an un-
likely partner in Holy Cross Hospital.
When Mount Sinai merged with Holy
Cross, they found a way to preserve
their different faith traditions while
committing to the same goal of serving
the community.
In 1990, Mount Sinai was designated
as a Level 1 Trauma Center, the high-
est level of surgical care for trauma pa-
tients. Today, Sinai is one of the un-
sung heroes in treating and working to
prevent the gun violence epidemic
plaguing Chicago. From supporting the
Gun Violence Research Collaborative
and community engagement programs
to providing world-class emergency
treatment and trauma care, Sinai is
working tirelessly to treat both the
physical and emotional wounds that vi-
olence causes, and survivors are put-
ting their lives back together at the
Schwab Rehabilitation Hospital.
I am proud to work with Mount Sinai
on the Chicago HEAL Initiative, which
is another example of Sinai’s continued
commitment to serving the commu-
nity. Under the HEAL Initiative, 10
major hospitals that are normally com-
petitors are collaborating to use their
economic footprint and community en-
gagement to reduce violence and im-
prove health in their neighborhoods.
Mount Sinai has embodied the Jew-
ish values of ‘‘tikkun olam,’’ meaning
repairing the world, and ‘‘hachnasat
orchim,’’ meaning the welcoming and
caring for a stranger, for a century
now. The names and the community
have changed, but the values have
never changed. Mount Sinai is still re-
pairing the world and caring for
strangers every day.
Congratulations on a century of help-
ing people, and here is to another cen-
tury.
(At the request of Mr. SCHUMER, the
following statement was ordered to be
printed in the RECORD.)

POLICY JUSTIFICATION
Japan—F–15J Modernization
The Government of Japan has requested
the upgrade of up to ninety-eight (98) F–15J
aircraft to a Japanese Super Interceptor
(JSI) configuration consisting of up to one
hundred three (103) APG–82(v)l Active Elec-
tronically Scanned Array (AESA) Radar (in-
cludes 5 spares); one hundred sixteen (116)
Advanced Display Core Processor II (ADCP
II) Mission System Computer (includes 18
spares); and one hundred one (101) ALQ–239
Digital Electronic Warfare System (DEWS)
(includes 3 spares). Also included are Joint
Mission Planning System (JMPS) with soft-
ware, training and support; Selective Avail-
ability Anti-spoofing Module (SAASM);
ARC–210 radio, aircraft and munition inte-
gration and test support; ground training de-
vices (including flight and maintenance sim-
ulators); support and test equipment; soft-
ware delivery and support; spare and repair
parts; communications equipment; facilities
and construction support; publications and
technical documentation; personnel training
and training equipment; U.S. Government
and contractor engineering; technical and lo-
gistics support services; studies and surveys;
and other related elements of logistical and
program support. The estimated total pro-
gram cost is $4.5 billion.
This proposed sale will support the foreign
policy goals and national security objectives
of the United States by improving the secu-
rity of a major ally that is a force for polit-
ical stability, and economic progress in the
Asia-Pacific region. It is vital to U.S. na-
tional interest to assist Japan in developing
and maintaining a strong and effective self-
defense capability.
This proposed sale will provide Japan a
critical air defense capability to assist in de-
fending the Japanese homeland and U.S. per-
sonnel stationed there. Modernized F–15J as-
sets will better enable Japan to respond to
airborne threats and defend its airspace.
Japan will have no difficulty absorbing this
equipment and support into its armed forces.
The proposed sale of this equipment and
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.
The prime contractor for the FMS portion
will be Boeing Aircraft Company, Everett,
WA. The prime contractor for the DCS por-
tion will be Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
(MHI) with Boeing being a sub-contractor in
supporting integration of the FMS and DCS
elements. There are no known offset agree-
ments proposed in connection with this po-
tential sale.
Implementation of this sale will require
the assignment of one U.S. Government rep-
resentative in Japan.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.
TRANSMITTAL NO. 19–65
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(l) of the
Arms Export Control Act
Annex Item No. vii
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
1. The proposed sale will be a hybrid For-
eign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct Com-
mercial Sales (DCS) case involving the re-
lease of sensitive technology to the Govern-
ment of Japan related to modernizing its F–
15J fleet. The F–15J aircraft is a twin-engine
all-weather air superiority fighter aircraft in
service since 1980 and built under license in
Japan by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Pre-
vious upgrades were carried out under the
Multi-Stage Improvement Program (MSIP).
The first phase of this program will consist
of upgrade design, development, modifica-
tion, training, support, and testing of the
first two (2) F–15J test aircraft resulting in
an upgraded Japanese Super Interceptor
(JSI) configuration. The follow-on produc-
tion phase will incorporate JSI upgrade kits
to modernize up to ninety-six (96) additional
F–15J aircraft.
2. The AN/APG–82(V)I is an Active Elec-
tronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar up-
grade for the F–15. It includes higher proc-
essor power, higher transmission power,
more sensitive receiver electronics, and Syn-
thetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which creates
higher-resolution ground maps from a great-
er distance than existing mechanically
scanned array radars. The upgrade features
an increase in detection range of air targets,
increases in processing speed and memory, as
well as significant improvements in all
modes.
3. The AN/ALQ–239 Digital Electronic War-
fare Suite (DEWS) provides passive radar
warning, wide spectrum RF jamming, and
control and management of the entire DEWS
system. This system is designed as an inter-
nal suite largely comprised of commercial-
off-the-shelf (COTS) technology.
4. Advanced Display Core Processor II
(ADCP II) is the mission processor for the F–
15 managing the overall mission functions
for the aircraft. The ADCP II controls the
aircraft’s avionics and provides data for the
cockpit displays. It contains multiple core
processors enabling rapid processing of data
and is connected to aircraft systems by re-
dundant MIL-STD–1553 buses and Ethernet
interfaces.
5. If a technologically advanced adversary
were to obtain knowledge of the specific
hardware or software in the proposed sale,
the information could be used to develop
counter-measures, which might reduce weap-
ons system effectiveness or be used in the de-
velopment of a system with similar or ad-
vanced capabilities.
6. The sensitive technology being released
under this notification is subject to the secu-
rity criteria established in National Disclo-
sure Policy (NDP–1) for the Government of
Japan. This sale is necessary in furtherance
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification.
7. All defense articles and services listed in
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to Japan.

REMEMBERING JOHN CONYERS
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I
rise today to pay tribute to Congress-
man John Conyers, Jr., a civil rights
icon, lifelong public servant, lover of
jazz, and champion for his beloved
hometown of Detroit.
Congressman Conyers was born in
Detroit on May 16, 1929, and spent the
next 90 years fighting for his city, our
State, our Nation, and the equality of
all people. He deeply understood the
challenges Detroit families face. In the
words of Kary Moss, executive director
of ACLU of Michigan: ‘‘He was of De-
troit and for Detroit.’’
He knew what it was like to wake up
and head to the factory; after grad-
uating from Northwestern High School,
he worked as a welder at a Lincoln
plant before earning bachelor’s and law
degrees from Wayne State University.
He knew what it was like to serve
this Nation in uniform; he enlisted in
the Army and served a tour of duty
during the Korean war.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6296 October 30, 2019
He knew what it was like to fight for
equality; he marched alongside Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in Selma,
AL; cofounded the Congressional Black
Caucus; and even hired civil rights icon
Rosa Parks as a secretary and recep-
tionist in his office.
He knew what it was like to devote
his life to public service, spending 53
years in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives and rising to lead the Judiciary
Committee. He fought to make Dr.
King’s birthday a national holiday,
protect the Voting Rights Act, change
mandatory sentences for nonviolent
drug offenders, and create death bene-
fits for police officers and firefighters
who died in the line of duty.
Public service was his calling, and
jazz was his passion. He had an ency-
clopedic knowledge of this most Amer-
ican form of music, gained through
hosting a jazz radio show in the 1970s
and spending as much time as possible
in Detroit’s jazz clubs. He introduced a
congressional resolution in 1987 desig-
nating jazz as ‘‘a rare and valuable na-
tional American treasure’’ and helped
establish the Smithsonian Jazz
Masterworks Orchestra.
Only five people in history have
served longer in the House of Rep-
resentatives than Congressman Con-
yers, and the people of Detroit always
knew that Congressman Conyers,
sporting a crisp shirt and dapper suit,
was in their corner.
My deepest condolences go to his
wife, Monica; his sons, John and Carl;
his family and many friends; and the
city of Detroit.

REMEMBERING SEN. KAY HAGAN
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I
rise today to remember our colleague
and friend, Kay Hagan.
The daughter of a World War II vet-
eran, with many other members of our
Armed Forces in her family, Kay made
service to others a cornerstone of her
life. Indeed, she wove that commit-
ment through her extraordinary career
in business and public office.
There was Kay’s devotion to her com-
munity and family. She served as a
church elder and Sunday school teach-
er at her Presbyterian congregation.
Even while rising through the ranks to
become an executive at the North
Carolina National Bank, she was active
in local politics, running county oper-
ations for two Gubernatorial cam-
paigns. And, in the midst of it all, she
and her husband Chip made it to the
Girl Scout meetings and school events
for their three children.
There was Kay’s outstanding career
in North Carolina State politics. For a
decade, she served in the North Caro-
lina Senate. She earned the gavel on
the senate budget committee. She
championed financial literacy in ele-
mentary and secondary education. Her
success landed her on North Carolina’s
most effective lawmakers list three
times.
Then there was Kay’s service in this
body. She championed fair pay for
women, expanding access to
healthcare, improving public edu-
cation, and nurturing small businesses,
which she recognized as the lifeblood of
North Carolina’s economy.
In the Senate, she honored her fam-
ily’s long record of military service as
a member of the Armed Services Com-
mittee. She chaired the vitally impor-
tant Emerging Threats and Capabili-
ties Subcommittee, which confronts
issues such as terrorism, weapons of
mass destruction, and drug trafficking.
She fought to ensure that funding bat-
tles in Washington never impede vet-
erans’ access to healthcare. She trav-

To Chip, Jeanette, Tilden, and
Carrie, I am sorry for your loss. Kay
left us too soon. She was a kind and
gracious colleague and a good friend.
She was a servant for good.
In the words of John Ellerton’s
Hymn, read at President Franklin D.

Now the laborer’s task is o’er;
Now the battle day is past . . .
Father, in Thy gracious keeping
Leave we now thy servant sleeping.
Rest in peace, Senator Hagan.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO THE 2019 ARKANSAS
BLACK HALL OF FAME INDUCTEES
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise
today to recognize the Arkansas Black
Hall of Fame Class 2019 and the con-
tributions made by the inductees to
the African-American community and
the State of Arkansas.
The 2019 inductees are former legislators,
business leaders, entertainers, artists, and
mentors. Their accomplishments and acco-
lades demonstrate how much of an impact
each has made in their fields, as well as on
our culture. Their historical significance is
widely acknowledged and bears out how de-
serving each honoree is of this recognition.
Irma Hunter Brown served in the Arkansas
House of Representatives for 22 years and
also went on to serve as a State senator. She
was the first African-American woman to
serve in either body of the Arkansas General
Assembly.
Brown is also the president of the Friends
of Haven of Rest Cemetery, Inc., an organiza-
tion dedicated to improving the condition
and appearances of the burial ground which
serves as a final resting place for several no-
table Black Arkansans, including Daisy
Gatson Bates, and contains a site commemo-
rating the 21 boys perished in the 1959 fire at
the Arkansas Negro Boys Industrial School
in Wrightsville. In 2008, Brown and a group of
Haven of Rest supporters started a project to
clean up and restore the cemetery as it is a
significant part of Arkansas history. The
group is now the Friends of Haven of Rest
Cemetery, Inc., which is continuing the fund-
raising and care for the cemetery grounds.
Wallace ‘‘Wali’’ Caradine was born in 1949
and grew up in West Memphis. He was the
first African American ever to graduate from
the Fay Jones School of Architecture and
Design at the University of Arkansas in 1974.
Four years later, with his partner Sam
Young, he established his first business, De-
sign and Construction Associates. The busi-
ness venture eventually became one of Ar-
kansas’ largest minority-owned contracting
firms.
Architecture and design weren’t only his
profession; they were his passion. In the mid-
1990s, Caradine and Ron Bene Woods formed
Woods Caradine Architects. In 2007, he estab-
lished Caradine & Company, where he
worked until his retirement in early 2017. As
an architect, Caradine left his footprints in
many places across Arkansas, designing sev-
eral notable facilities still in use today.
Wali Caradine was also dedicated to his
community. He was a mentor to many mi-
nority building contractors in central Ar-
kansas. In 1986, he founded the Arkansas
Chapter of the National Association of Mi-
nority Contractors. Between 2009 and 2013,
Caradine was a member of central Arkansas
advisory committee for the University of Ar-
kansas.
John Donley was born in Gould, AR, but
has left his mark on our country’s entertain-
ment industry. He is a producer, executive,
and an award-winning television writer.
Donley wrote for many of the most beloved
comedies of the 1970s and ‘80s, including
‘‘Diff’rent Strokes,’’ ‘‘Good Times,’’ and
‘‘The Jeffersons.’’ He won an NAACP Image
Award for his writing in an episode of
‘‘Diff’rent Strokes.’’ In addition to writing
for hit shows, Donley has also worked with
Hollywood stars such as Sinbad and Curtis
Mayfield and found a home at the big-name
networks ABC and CBS. While he clearly has
the ability to make people laugh, John
Donley also uses his talent to unite audi-
ences all over the country.
Ed Johnson has coached 27 players who
went on to play in the National Football
League; however, his impact on the Little
Rock community and the United States goes
beyond the field. Coach Johnson is a Viet-
nam war veteran whose service is marked by
two Purple Heart Awards, a Bronze Star
Award, and Presidential Citations.
Upon returning home in 1971, Coach John-
son helped organize the Sunset Youth Sports
Program in Little Rock and by the next year
had formed the Sunset Tigers Football
Team. While he is passionate about his role
as a football coach, Johnson uses this posi-
tion to change kids’ lives off of the field.
Coach Ed Johnson has served the Little
Rock community for 48 years and is believed
to be the longest serving active community
youth football coach in Arkansas.
Kristin Lewis is a native of Little Rock
and a globally recognized lyrico-spinto so-
prano. She graduated from the University of
Central Arkansas in 1999 with a bachelor’s
degree in vocal performance and also re-
ceived a master’s degree from the University
of Knoxville in 2002. Since then, she has per-
formed in many prestigious venues, includ-
ing the Vienna State Opera, the Berlin State
Opera, and the Teatro San Carlo in Naples.
She made her debut at the Metropolitan
Opera in New York in January 2019. Lewis
has been widely praised for her perform-
ances. Her talents have also been recognized
with several awards, including the Orazio
Tosi Prize from Parma Lirica in 2012,
Savonlinna Opera Festival’s Artist of the
Year in 2010, and the Ferrucio Tagliavini
International Singing Competition in 2005.
Lewis’s first musical environment was
within her family. Having this insight into
the role of environment to enhance and de-
velop one’s talents, she established the Kris-
tin Lewis Foundation, Inc., a nonprofit cor-
poration that fosters the development of
young singers through competition and
scholarships. Foundation activities, includ-
ing fundraising events and vocal competi-
tions, are hosted in central Arkansas. Lewis
is also very active in humanitarian work

Roscoe Robinson is an acclaimed artist
across both the gospel and R&B genres. He
has performed with popular gospel groups
such as the Highway Q.C.’s, the Fairfield
Four, Five Blind Boys of Mississippi, the
Blind Boys of Alabama, and the Five Trum-
pets. Though he was successful in the gospel
community, his talents did not stop there.
Through the 1980s, Roscoe also recorded a
number of popular rhythm and blues songs.
Roscoe is originally from Dermott, AR, but
his talents have touched the souls of fans
across Arkansas and America.
Each of these inductees has earned a place
of honor as a result of the lives they have
lived and the work they have done over
many years. The Arkansas Black Hall of
Fame Class of 2019 is clearly an exemplary
group, and I congratulate each member and
their loved ones, who have also been on their
journeys, on this tremendous recognition.∑
f
TRIBUTE TO DOTTIE WILSON
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this
week I have the honor of recognizing
Dottie Wilson of Hill County for her
tremendous impact on the north cen-
tral Montana community of Havre.
Dottie, a former baker at Grateful
Bread, took a tremendous leap of faith
and made the decision to open her own
bakery, Infinity Bake Shoppe LLC in
April of 2017.
Dottie’s bakery offers a variety of
baked goods including cookies, pas-
tries, scones, and cinnamon rolls, as
well as three different varieties of
baked donuts, soups, and lunch items.
Since Infinity Bake Shoppe opened,
it has been a great addition to the
Havre community. Dottie did not an-
ticipate her new business would take
off so quickly, but folks from all across
the HiLine are lining up for her baked
goods.
Dottie said she was inspired to start
her own business in order to provide
her daughter Keeley with a more pur-
poseful future. Keeley, who has Wil-
liams syndrome, followed in her moth-
er’s entrepreneurial spirit and opened
up, Lady Bug Bites LLC, making and
selling treats for dogs and cats.
It is my honor to recognize Dottie
Wilson for her hard work and talent in
opening up Infinity Bake Shoppe LLC.
She is a fine example of the type of en-
trepreneurship coming from Montana
Main Street businesses.∑
f
TRIBUTE TO JENNIFER EVANS
∑ Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today,
I rise to pay tribute to Jennifer Evans,
the president of Leadership Georgia for
2019. Leadership Georgia is one of the
Nation’s oldest and most successful
State leadership training programs.
Leadership Georgia serves primarily
young business, civic, community lead-
ers who have the desire and potential
to work together for a better Georgia.
The idea for a statewide leadership
development program was first pro-
posed in 1971 during an informal con-
versation between several key business
leaders at a Georgia Chamber of Com-
merce meeting. This inspired group in-
cluded Pat Patillo, then-president of
the Georgia Chamber; business leader
Jim Lientz, Sr.; Rogers Wade of the
Georgia Public Policy Foundation; and
community visionary J.W. Fanning,
who would eventually serve as the pro-
gram’s longtime advisor and guiding
hand.
The first class of Leadership Georgia
started in 1972 and included aspiring
leaders from across the State. Future
U.S. Senator Sam Nunn was a member
of the inaugural class who, at the time,
was a young lawyer from Perry, GA.
The story goes that Nunn was inspired
to run for the Senate shortly after at-
tending his first Leadership Georgia
Program. I am also a proud alumnus of
the organization, as is my former col-
league, Saxby Chambliss.
Beyond its founding, Leadership
Georgia leads the way in many areas.
Thanks to J.W. Fanning’s active wife
Cora Lee, Leadership Georgia has al-
ways stressed partner and spousal par-
ticipation. Another key focus of Lead-
ership Georgia is diversity among its
members. The highly competitive se-
lection process includes participants
from every comer of the State and
seeks out those from different occupa-
tions, genders, cultures, and races. The
philosophy behind this diversity goal is
that each Leadership Georgia class of
120-plus participants connects on a
deeply personal level that highlights
different perspectives while learning
how to work together as one united
force for Georgia’s best future.
As president of Leadership Georgia
for 2019, Jennifer Evans was responsible
for selecting the five locations where
the Leadership Georgia class have
spent their time together. To showcase
the ‘‘Georgia United’’ theme she chose,
Jennifer selected the Georgia commu-
nities of Young Harris and its
Brasstown Resort in the North Georgia
mountains; Albany, which has been re-
silient in the face of recent natural dis-
asters; Gainesville, the poultry capital
of the world; and Perry, home to the
Georgia National Fairgrounds.
This year, Jennifer also set aside one
of these programs to visit us here in
Washington, DC, to allow these emerg-
ing leaders to interact with their elect-
ed and appointed officials to deliver
the message of ‘‘United We Can’’ and
encourage us to find common ground
for the betterment of our State and Na-
tion. That is a message I think all of us
need to hear on a regular basis.
Both members of Leadership Geor-
gia’s Class of 2011, Jennifer and her
husband Lee, have dedicated countless
hours of time to Leadership Georgia to
ensure the organization maintains its
sterling reputation in our State. They
served as program chairs for the Lead-
ership Georgia Class of 2012 and
planned and executed a successful pro-
gram weekend in Savannah, GA. Jen-
nifer then served on the board of trust-
ees from 2013 through 2015, where she
helped select class members for those
years, and she was asked to rejoin the
board of trustees and serve as the vice
president of the organization in 2018.
She is currently serving as president
and next year will assume the role of
chair of the board of trustees.
In addition to their volunteer work
for Leadership Georgia, Jennifer and
Lee both have busy lives and full-time
jobs in Vidalia, GA. Jennifer is director
of transportation for Dot Foods, and
Lee just opened his first Barbaritos
franchise. Their children, Rebecca, who
is 14 years old, and Cham, who is 12,
have practically grown up with Leader-
ship Georgia and have been able to
build lifelong friendships with kids
from across our great State through
the extended Leadership Georgia fam-
ily.
It gives me hope for the future that
folks like Jennifer and Lee Evans are
in each of our States and communities
focused on nurturing and developing
future leaders, working to overcome
differences, and focusing on bettering
communities for so many.
I want to congratulate Jennifer, cur-
rent board chair Matt Bishop, the en-
tire volunteer Leadership Georgia
Board of Trustees, and the program
chair team assembled by Jennifer and
Lee on delivering a fantastic year for
the 2019 class of Leadership Georgia.∑

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS
SENATE RESOLUTION 386—SUP-
PORTING INTERNATIONAL CO-
OPERATION AND CONTINUED
UNITED STATES LEADERSHIP TO
MAINTAIN ACCESS TO SPACE
AND ACHIEVE ADVANCES IN
SPACE TECHNOLOGY
Mr. UDALL (for himself and Mr.
KAINE) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation:
S. RES. 386
Whereas there are approximately 2,062 ac-
tive satellites in Earth orbit, 24,000 objects
tracked by the Air Force that are debris or
inactive satellites, and many more objects
that are currently too small to track;
Whereas the United States has a leading
role in the management of space traffic;
Whereas space is an increasingly impor-
tant environment for economic growth due
to the development of small satellite tech-
nologies and the reduced cost of space launch
resulting from innovations by private enti-
ties;
Whereas, on a daily basis, multiple coun-
tries, businesses, and billions of individuals
rely on the information and communications
capabilities provided by satellites in space;
Whereas maintaining access to space is
vital for the national security and economic
interests of the United States;
Whereas increased space traffic at different
orbits presents a new challenge for govern-
ments, private entities, researchers, and the
Armed Forces;
Whereas the goal of the United States is to
support development of space by private en-
tities, including the development of space
tourism;
Whereas, in 2019, the United States com-
memorated the 50th anniversary of the Apol-
lo 11 moon landing;
Whereas the United States completed 6
crewed lunar landing missions, multiple or-
bital missions, and numerous other robotic
missions to the Moon and each of the planets
in the solar system and beyond;
Whereas the United States aims to return
to the Moon by 2024 and subsequently send
the first crewed mission to Mars;
Whereas destructive anti-satellite tests
threaten international access to space;
Whereas a collision or other preventable
disaster in space would reduce access to
space and threaten future military, civil, and
commercial missions in space for all coun-
tries;
Whereas the United States and 108 other
countries are parties to the Treaty on Prin-
ciples Governing the Activities of States in
the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, In-
cluding the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies,
done at Washington, London, and Moscow
January 27, 1967 (18 UST 2410) (in this pre-
amble referred to as the ‘‘Outer Space Trea-
ty’’);
Whereas access to space and the manage-
ment of space traffic are international prob-
lems that require creative technical and
legal solutions;
Whereas Article I of the Outer Space Trea-
ty states that—
(1) the exploration and use of outer space,
including the Moon and other celestial bod-
ies, shall be carried out for the benefit and in
the interests of all countries, irrespective of
their degree of economic or scientific devel-
opment, and shall be the province of all man-
kind;
(2) outer space, including the Moon and
other celestial bodies, shall be free for explo-
ration and use by all states without dis-
crimination of any kind, on a basis of equal-
ity and in accordance with international
law, and there shall be free access to all
areas of celestial bodies; and
(3) there shall be freedom of scientific in-
vestigation in outer space, including the
Moon and other celestial bodies, and states
shall facilitate and encourage international
cooperation in such investigation;
Whereas realization of Article I of the
Outer Space Treaty requires sustainable ac-
cess to space;
Whereas actions that could threaten access
to space, such as an inadvertent or inten-
tional creation of persistent debris, threaten
the potential to explore and use space for all
countries;
Whereas if agreements on the sustainable
use of space are not made, the potential for
a future trillion-dollar economy in space will
be threatened;
Whereas the United States has been a lead-
er in developing the rules, regulations, and
best practices for successful operation in
space;
Whereas the United Nations Committee on
the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space—
(1) furthers the exploration and use of
space for the benefit of all humanity;
(2) works on a consensus basis with 92
member states; and
(3) in 2011, was charged with developing
guidelines for space sustainability;
Whereas the United States has been instru-
mental in the development of those guide-
lines; and
Whereas the United Nations Committee on
the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space has agreed
on 21 such guidelines for implementation:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) supports improvements in space situa-
tional awareness and advances in technology
and international cooperation;
(2) recognizes that the use of space by gov-
ernments and private entities requires a sys-
tem for deconfliction of space traffic and
prevention of collisions to ensure the use of
space for current and future users;
(3) supports the efforts of the international
community and the United States to imple-
ment the 21 guidelines for space sustain-
ability agreed on by the United Nations
Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer
Space;
(4) encourages the Secretary of State to
continue to support those efforts;
(5) supports continued interagency ef-
forts—
(A) to streamline regulations relating to
access to space; and
(B) to support the continued sustainable
use of space by government and private enti-
ties in Earth orbit and deep space; and
(6) requests that the Secretary of State no-
tify Congress of any legislative requirements
for implementation of the 21 guidelines for
space sustainability agreed on by the United
Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of
Outer Space.

(2) approximately 1 in 5 women in the
United States and up to 1 in 7 men in the
United States have experienced severe phys-
ical violence by an intimate partner at some
point in their lifetimes;
Whereas, on average, 3 women in the
United States are killed each day by a cur-
rent or former intimate partner, according
to the Bureau of Justice Statistics;
Whereas domestic violence can affect any-

partner violence have been victimized by the
same offender previously;
Whereas domestic violence is cited as a
significant factor in homelessness among
families;
Whereas millions of children are exposed
to domestic violence each year;
Whereas research shows that boys who are
exposed to domestic violence in their house-
holds are more likely to become perpetrators
of intimate partner violence;
Whereas victims of domestic violence expe-
rience immediate and long-term negative
outcomes, including detrimental effects on
mental and physical health;
Whereas victims of domestic violence may
lose several days of paid work each year and

Whereas crisis hotlines serving domestic
violence victims operate 24 hours per day, 365
days per year, and offer important crisis
intervention services, support services, in-
formation, and referrals for victims;
Whereas staff and volunteers of domestic
violence shelters and programs in the United
States, in cooperation with 56 State and ter-
ritorial coalitions against domestic violence,
serve—
(1) thousands of adults and children each
day; and
(2) 1,000,000 adults and children each year;
Whereas, according to a 2016 survey con-

SENATE RESOLUTION 388—CALL-
ING FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF
THE UNITED STATES FROM THE
OPEN SKIES TREATY, AND FOR
OTHER PURPOSES
Mr. CRUZ (for himself and Mr. COT-
TON) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations:
S. RES. 388
Whereas the Department of State has re-
peatedly assessed and documented in its an-
nual report on Adherence to and Compliance
with Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and
Disarmament Agreements and Commit-
ments, that Russia is violating the Treaty
on Open Skies, done at Helsinki March 24,
1992, and entered into force January 1, 2002
(commonly known as the ‘‘Open Skies Trea-
ty’’);
Whereas, in 2015, Director of the Defense
Intelligence Agency, Lieutenant General
Vincent R. Stewart, testified to Congress
that ‘‘[t]he Open Skies construct was de-
signed for a different era,’’ and in 2016, that
the treaty allows Russia ‘‘to get incredible
foundational intelligence on critical infra-
structure, bases, ports, all of our facilities’’
and provides Russia with ‘‘a significant ad-
vantage’’;
Whereas, in 2016, the Commander of the
United States Strategic Command, Admiral
Cecil Haney, testified to Congress that the
Open Skies Treaty gives Russia ‘‘a capability
to be able to reconnoiter parts of our coun-
try and other nations’’;
Whereas, in 2017, the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford, tes-
tified to Congress that ‘‘we don’t believe the
treaty should be in place if the Russians
aren’t complying’’;
Whereas the Government of the Russian
Federation has recently used the Open Skies
Treaty for surveillance of major American
cities and infrastructure, including Wash-
ington D.C. and New York City;
Whereas the Government of the Russian
Federation has installed advanced digital
technology for use in Open Skies flights, en-
hancing its surveillance and espionage capa-
bilities;
Whereas Government of the Russian Fed-
eration has limited and at times outright de-
nied access for surveillance flights by the
United States and other countries;
Whereas Congress has repeatedly sought to
limit implementation of the Open Skies
Treaty in response to Russian treaty viola-
tions, including in the John S. McCain Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232);
Whereas the United States Government
has developed and deployed technology so
that it does not gain significant additional
intelligence from participating in the Open
Skies Treaty; and
Whereas participating in the Open Skies
Treaty costs the United States hundreds of
millions of dollars in unnecessary spending:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That—
(1) the United States Government should
declassify to the maximum extent possible,
without materially or immediately threat-
ening the security of the United States, its
intelligence and assessments regarding Rus-
sian exploitation of the Open Skies Treaty to
undermine United States national security;
and
(2) the United States should withdraw from
the Open Skies Treaty.
SENATE RESOLUTION 389—CALL-
ING ON CONGRESS, SCHOOLS,
AND STATE AND LOCAL EDU-
CATIONAL AGENCIES TO RECOG-
NIZE THE SIGNIFICANT EDU-
CATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF
DYSLEXIA THAT MUST BE AD-
DRESSED, AND DESIGNATING OC-
TOBER 2019 AS ‘‘NATIONAL DYS-
LEXIA AWARENESS MONTH’’
Mr. CASSIDY (for himself, Mr. BOOZ-
MAN, Mr. GRAHAM, Mrs. CAPITO, Mr.
MURPHY, Ms. WARREN, and Mr. KING)
submitted the following resolution;
which was considered and agreed to:
S. RES. 389
Whereas dyslexia is—
(1) defined as an unexpected difficulty in
reading for an individual who has the intel-
ligence to be a much better reader; and
(2) most commonly caused by a difficulty
in phonological processing (the appreciation
of the individual sounds of spoken language),
which affects the ability of an individual to
speak, read, spell, and, often, the ability to
learn a second language;
Whereas, the First Step Act of 2018 (Public
Law 115–391; 132 Stat. 5194) included a defini-
tion of dyslexia as part of the requirement of
the Act to screen inmates for dyslexia upon
intake in Federal prisons;
Whereas the definition of dyslexia in sec-
tion 3635 of title 18, United States Code, as
added by section 101(a) of the First Step Act
of 2018 (Public Law 115–391; 132 Stat. 5195), is
the first and only definition of dyslexia in a
Federal statute;
Whereas dyslexia is the most common
learning disability and affects 80 to 90 per-
cent of all individuals with a learning dis-
ability;
Whereas dyslexia is persistent and highly
prevalent, affecting as many as 1 out of
every 5 individuals;
Whereas dyslexia is a paradox, in that an
individual with dyslexia may have both—
(1) weaknesses in decoding that result in
difficulties in accurate or fluent word rec-
ognition; and
(2) strengths in higher-level cognitive func-
tions, such as reasoning, critical thinking,
concept formation, and problem solving;
Whereas great progress has been made in
understanding dyslexia on a scientific level,
including the epidemiology and cognitive
and neurobiological bases of dyslexia;
Whereas the achievement gap between typ-
ical readers and dyslexic readers occurs as
early as first grade; and
Whereas early screening for, and early di-
agnosis of, dyslexia are critical for ensuring
that individuals with dyslexia receive fo-
cused, evidence-based intervention that
leads to fluent reading, the promotion of
self-awareness and self-empowerment, and
the provision of necessary accommodations
that ensure success in school and in life:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) calls on Congress, schools, and State
and local educational agencies to recognize
that dyslexia has significant educational im-
plications that must be addressed; and
(2) designates October 2019 as ‘‘National
Dyslexia Awareness Month’’.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF
JEFFERY SCOTT BOREN
HON. TRENT KELLY
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to celebrate the life of Jeffery
Scott Boren, who passed away on Wednes-
day, September 11th, at the age of 46.
Jeff, a lifelong Mississippi resident, lived
with his family in Itawamba County, Mis-
sissippi, and was a dedicated employee for
the Mississippi Department of Transportation.
Throughout his life, Jeff set an example for his
family to follow. He was an active member of
Ozark Baptist Church, where he was chosen
to serve as a Deacon of the church.
Left to cherish his memory is his wife,
Candace Boren; his daughter, Alisha Boren;
his brother Gary Boren; and his mother, Diane
Knight of Mantachie, Mississippi, as well as
many more extended family members and
friends.
Jeff’s life was one of service, grace, love for
his family, and community. He will be greatly
missed by all whom he encountered.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF PAUL
STANLEY WEBSTER
HON. DEREK KILMER
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, on Novem-
ber 11, 2019, our nation will observe Veterans
Day, a federally recognized holiday wherein
we honor our military veterans and all those
who have served in the United States Armed
Forces. Today, I rise to honor Paul Stanley
Webster, who served with distinction as a Ma-
chinist’s Mate Second Class in the United
States Navy.
Paul Webster was born on February 13,
1925 in Port Angeles, Washington. He be-
came an enlisted servicemember of the United
States Navy and entered into active service on
August 16, 1943. According to service
records, Paul was a member of the United
States Naval Construction Battalions, other-
wise known as the ‘‘Seabees″. This group of
naval personnel was a revered battalion of
construction tradesmen that were capable of
any type of construction, anywhere needed,
under any conditions or circumstances pre-
sented.
Paul served with the Ninth Naval Construc-
tion Battalion and would go on to earn the Asi-
atic Pacific Arena Campaign Medal, American
Area Campaign Medal, and the World War II
Victory Medal. His tours of duty included Ice-
land, Pearl Harbor, Tinian, and Okinawa. Dur-
ing his service, Paul was involved in a number
of vitally important naval construction projects,
including the development of bomber airstrips,
fuel and salvage depots, highways, and air-
craft repair shops.
Madam Speaker, I am so proud to honor
and share Paul Stanley Webster’s legacy of
service to our great nation. As Congress
spends time observing Veterans Day this year,
let us remember the many sacrifices that so
many servicemembers have made to preserve
our values and freedoms. We cannot take
them for granted and we must fight vigilantly
to protect them.

HONORING DR. WILLIAM CHUN-
HOON
HON. JUDY CHU
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Dr.
William Chun-Hoon, who passed away on Oc-
tober 1, 2019 at the age of 91. Dr. Chun-Hoon
was a lifelong leader in his community, uti-
lizing his role as the first Chinese-American
principal in Los Angeles Unified School District
to bring people of diverse backgrounds to-
gether.
Dr. Chun-Hoon was born in Honolulu on
September 8, 1928 and grew up working in
his parents’ grocery stores before moving to
Los Angeles to become a teacher. Initially, he
served as a history and English teacher in
East Los Angeles, before becoming an Assist-
ant Principal for Counseling for two middle
schools in the San Fernando Valley.
In 1973, Dr. Chun-Hoon was appointed as
principal of Castelar Elementary School, a po-
sition he held for the next 19 years. As the
first Chinese-American principal in Los Ange-
les Unified School District, he implemented a
variety of initiatives to ensure that the school
would be a center for community and engage-
ment. At Castelar, Dr. Chun-Hoon spear-
headed a pilot program that allowed students
to study either a Chinese or Spanish bilingual
curriculum, fostering an environment where
students of diverse backgrounds could flourish
and learn. At the same time, he provided adult
classes for the parents and grandparents of
these children, giving them an opportunity to
improve their language skills. He allowed com-
munity organizations like the Chinese Histor-
ical Society and the Friends of the Chinese
American Museum to use Castelar as a space
where people living both inside and outside of
Chinatown could meet, organize, and provide
services to the community. Dr. Chun-Hoon
also coordinated with other Chinatown leaders
to establish the first public library in the com-
munity.
Dr. Chun-Hoon is survived by his beloved
wife of 62 years, Marjorie; their children, Craig
and Kristina; and their grandchildren, Sarah,
Carly, James, and Scott. He leaves behind an
enduring legacy of dedication, inclusion, and
service to Los Angeles and the San Gabriel
Valley. Dr. Chun-Hoon is an inspiration to all
who knew him, and it is my distinct honor to
commemorate his life.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DONALD
J. WINN
HON. JOHN KATKO
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life of Donald J. Winn, who passed
away on October 17, 2019, at the age of 90.
A veteran, loving husband, father, and grand-
father, Donald Winn will be dearly missed by
his family and community.
A graduate of Searles High School in Mas-
sachusetts, Donald Winn enlisted in the U.S.
Army following his graduation and proudly
served his county in the Korean War. After the
war, Donald Winn returned home and worked
for the Friendly’s Corporation for 32 years,
eventually retiring as a District Manager.
Donald Winn was married to his wife
Maurita for 60 years, and together, they have
5 children and 12 grandchildren. He was
known for his commitment to his family and
his love for family-time. An avid University of
Connecticut Women’s Basketball fan, Donald
Winn would often take his grandchildren to
games, even attending several NCAA Final
Four contests. Additionally, Donald Winn
treasured the beach, especially enjoying family
vacations to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues
in the House join me in honoring the life of
Donald J. Winn. A devoted family-man and
veteran, Donald Winn’s legacy will always be
remembered and cherished. I encourage my
colleagues to keep his family in their prayers
during this truly difficult time.

OUTRAGEOUS LOCK AND DAM
DECISION
HON. JOE WILSON
OF SOUTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Yesterday,
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced
their outrageous decision to continue with the
removal of the New Savannah Bluff Lock and
Dam and move forward with Alternative 2–6D,
which was partially simulated in February of
this year with catastrophic results.
Since the day the Corps announced their
disastrous plans to remove the Lock and Dam,
I have worked to fight for a positive decision.
Senators LINDSEY GRAHAM, TIM SCOTT, JOHN-
NY ISAKSON, and DAVID PERDUE with Con-
gressman RICK ALLEN representing the Central
Savannah River Area have consistently ar-
gued that the clear legislative intent of Con-
gress was to maintain the physical pool level
at the date of enactment being 114.5 feet.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1370 October 30, 2019
Lowering the pool level would negatively de-
stroy jobs, recreation, and economic develop-
ment up and down the river undermining hun-
dreds of millions of dollars of investment. The
Corps has chosen to ignore the will of the
American people and the intent of Congress
and move forward in complete disregard of the
law. I am grateful to work with North Augusta
Mayor Bob Pettit, Representative Bill Hixon,
Senator Tom Young, South Carolina Attorney
General Alan Wilson, and many other local
leaders on this issue from South Carolina and
Georgia.
In conclusion, God Bless Our Troops and
we will never forget September 11th in the
Global War on Terrorism. Just as next week
we cherish the thirtieth anniversary of Ronald
Reagan’s liberation of Europe from Com-
munist socialism.

HONORING ST. LUKE’S LUTHERAN
CHURCH 150TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I want to rec-
ognize a beloved place of worship in my dis-
trict that is celebrating its remarkable 150th
Anniversary this year, St. Luke’s Lutheran
Church in New Rochelle.
The mission of St. Luke’s Lutheran Church
is one of hope and service to the community.
St. Luke’s exists in order to communicate the
Lutheran understanding of the gospel of Jesus
Christ to everyone through a community that
seeks warmth and meaning in everyday life.
St. Luke’s mission is to address the commu-
nity with respect through teaching, hospitality,
Word and Sacrament in a fellowship faithful to
Jesus Christ and committed to growth in re-
sponse to our Lord’s Great Commission: ‘‘Go
therefore and make disciples.’’
In the words of church Reverend Dr. William
J. Damrow, ‘‘We have been marked as a peo-
ple called to reach out and welcome all. We
are a people who enjoy diverse backgrounds,
yet, in common we share our struggles while
affirming the gifts of faith, hope, love, and for-
giveness. Come visit, worship, and grow with
us.’’
It is in this spirit of inclusivity that St. Luke’s
Lutheran Church has blossomed, with a loving
and dedicated congregation.
As Representative for New York’s 16th Con-
gressional District, I want to congratulate Rev-
erend Damrow, the staff, leadership, and con-
gregation of St. Luke’s Lutheran Church on
reaching this blessed milestone. Here is to
150 more years of serving the people of New
Rochelle and the surrounding community in
Westchester.

CELEBRATING ANTHONY AND
KAREN REED OF THE PURPLE
CHURCH
HON. DONNA E. SHALALA
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I rise in
celebration of pastors Rev. Dr. Anthony Reed
and Rev. Karen Reed of South Miami-Dade’s
Martin Memorial African Methodist Episcopal
Church, commonly known as the Purple
Church.
The Reeds have been with the Purple
Church for 14 years, providing constant sup-
port and inspiration for the Richmond Heights
community. The Purple Church maintains ac-
tive community outreach initiatives, including a
food program, support for the homeless and
juvenile offenders, and toy giveaways. The
Reeds’ leadership has brought their commu-
nity together to participate in and benefit from
these community service activities.
The Reeds are committed to helping anyone
who comes to them looking for support, re-
gardless of culture or background. This spirit
of acceptance led them to found the Unity
Gathering, through which members of multiple
churches come together in worship. The Unity
Gathering also serves to raise scholarship
funds to help attend college.
I’m deeply grateful to Anthony and Karen
Reed and for their dedication to the South
Dade community.

NEW DEAL FOR NEW AMERICANS
ACT
HON. GRACE MENG
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, the United
States is the nation that it is today, because
of immigrant contributions. In fact, I am proud
to represent one of the most diverse congres-
sional districts in the country—Queens, New
York; it is a place where immigrant commu-
nities thrive.
I also know our nation can only get stronger
if we assist new Americans in their efforts to
contribute to the growth of our economy and
be civically engaged.
Madam Speaker, I am a daughter of immi-
grants. I saw firsthand the difficulties my par-
ents and grandparents encountered when they
immigrated to the United States for a better
life for their children. This is not an uncommon
story. While the levels of hardships of new im-
migrants vary, there are common challenges—
from language barriers to finding work.
That is why, I am so proud to introduce the
‘‘New Deal for New Americans Act,’’ legislation
which would ensure a more inclusive and wel-
coming system for all those who arrive on our
shores.
Specifically, the ‘‘New Deal for New Ameri-
cans Act’’ would:
Establish a National Office of New Ameri-
cans in the Executive Office of the White
House to promote and support immigrant and
refugee integration and inclusion and coordi-
nate efforts of federal, state, and local govern-
ments to support social, economic, and civic
integration of immigrants and refugees.
Establish a Federal Initiative on New Ameri-
cans to coordinate federal response to ad-
dress issues that affect the lives of new immi-
grants and refugees and communities with
growing immigrant and refugee populations.
Create a Legal Services and Immigration
Assistance Grant Program to support organi-
zations that provide direct immigration assist-
ance to those in need of immigration screen-
ing; know-your-rights education; assistance in
applying for citizenship, lawful permanent resi-
dent status or other immigration status; or
seeking relief from a removal order.
Create an English as a Gateway to Integra-
tion Program for organizations that teach
English or help individuals prepare for natu-
ralization or earn a GED.
Create a Workforce Development Grant
Program to ensure that immigrant and refugee
adults have equitable access to education and
workforce programs that help equip them with
occupational skills needed to secure or ad-
vance in employment.
Reduce barriers for individuals to naturalize
by establishing a flat application fee for natu-
ralization, amending the English and civics
exam requirements for older individuals, and
exempting eligible U.S. high school graduates
from taking the naturalization exams.
Limit USCIS’s ability to raise fees without
Congress’ approval, plus require authorization
of appropriations to cover USCIS’ need to op-
erate and adjudicate cases.
Promote civic engagement through auto-
matic voter registration of newly naturalized in-
dividuals.
Expand family integration by reducing the
age of citizens who are able to petition eligible
family members from 21 years old to 18 years
old.
Increase Refugee Admissions level to
110,000 per fiscal year.
Provide social, economic, and civic support
to refugees and rebuild the capacity and infra-
structure of local communities to welcome ref-
ugees.
Amend the Immigration and Nationality Act
to no longer allow deportation of an individual
deemed to have become a public charge.
Madam Speaker, the United States is a na-
tion of immigrants. The rich tapestry of our na-
tion that is comprised of diverse cultures, lan-
guages, and lives experiences have always
been America’s strength. Immigrants and refu-
gees have always been America’s strength—
which is why improving our system to wel-
come new Americans will ensure our nation
continues to thrive. I urge my colleagues to
support this legislation and join me in moving
our diverse nation forward by helping immi-
grants and refugees.

Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize World War II Veteran Edward H.
Morrissette of Omaha who will be awarded
with France’s highest distinction—the Legion
of Honor—on October 30, 2019 for his her-
oism and courage in the liberation of France.
Mr. Morrissette enlisted in the U.S. Army in
1940, at the age of 17. He served with the
16th Regiment, First Infantry Division, also
known as ‘‘The Big Red One,’’ as a machine
gun squad leader and military policeman.
From August 1942 until September 1945, he
participated in the campaigns of North Africa,
Sicily, Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland,
Ardennes and Central Europe.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1371
October 30, 2019
On June 6, 1944 Edward landed at Omaha
Beach as part of the second wave. He then
went on to fight in the Battle of the Hedgerows
and participated in the capture of St. Lô and
many other cities in Normandy. During the fall
and winter of 1944–45, he fought in the
Hürtgen Forest and the Battle of the Bulge be-
fore entering Germany and later Czecho-
slovakia.
After the war, Mr. Morrissette obtained a
civil engineering degree from Indiana Tech
University and spent most of his career with
the U.S. Air Force including time at Langley
Air Force Base at Norfolk, Virginia and March
Air Force Base in Southern California. In
1972, he moved to Nebraska and was em-
ployed by Offutt Air Force Base, where he re-
tired in 1981 as the Deputy Director of Oper-
ations and Maintenance for Strategic Air Com-
mand.
For his actions during World War II, he was
awarded the Bronze Star Medal, the Euro-
pean-African-Middle Eastern Ribbon, the Good
Conduct Medal, the American Defense Serv-
ice Medal, and the Distinguished Unit Badge.
The Legion of Honor is the highest distinc-
tion that France can bestow upon those who
have achieved remarkable deeds for France.
Founded by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802, the
National Order of the Legion of Honor recog-
nizes eminent service to the French Republic.
Recipients of this honor are named by a de-
cree signed by the President of the Republic.
The Consul General will present the medal on
behalf President Macron of France on October
29, 2019.
I personally thank Mr. Morrissette for his
many years of sacrificial service to our coun-
try, and the liberation of so many in France.
Without courageous men like him, World War
II might have had a completely different end-
ing. Congratulations to Edward on receiving
this prestigious honor. It is well deserved.

MOUNT VERNON SEVENTH-DAY
ADVENTIST CHURCH 80TH ANNI-
VERSARY
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, today I recog-
nize one of the great religious institutions in
New York’s 16th Congressional District, the
Mount Vernon Seventh-day Adventist Church,
which this year is celebrating its 80th year of
ministry in the community.
The Mount Vernon Church’s journey began
in the Fall of 1932 when Thaddeus Wilson,
Sr., a layman and local elder of the New Ro-
chelle S.D.A. Church, purchased two thousand
Present Truth tracts in hope of starting a bible
study. A weekly Bible study class began in a
private home at the corner of East Third Street
and South Seventh Avenue. In less than a
month the interest and attendance had grown
so much that two adjoining rooms had to be
used to accommodate the people. From there,
the gatherings grew, to tented meetings
whose patrons later formed the nucleus of the
Mount Vernon Mission. The Mission’s first
home was in a loft at 3 West Third Street, at
the comer of West Third Street and South
Fourth Avenue.
In 1939, the mission was organized into a
church. This was a milestone in the history of
the Mount Vernon Church. In 1942, a drive
was started to raise funds to purchase a lot on
South Fifth Avenue and by the 1950’s the
church building was complete. Over the years
it became apparent that the building had be-
come too small for its growing membership,
and a new place was sought. The present edi-
fice located at 230 South Columbus Avenue
was purchased and a grand reopening came
in 1975.
As the church grew it continued to welcome
many new individuals into the church. It also
expanded its youth programming and commu-
nity outreach. The Mount Vernon Church is
also responsible for starting two daughter
churches.
The Mount Vernon Church has a remark-
able history and an equally wonderful legacy
in this community and beyond. I want to con-
gratulate the entire congregation and church
leadership for 80 incredible years.

RECOGNIZING TORNADO
RECOVERY VOLUNTEERS
HON. VAN TAYLOR
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the efforts of countless volunteers
and public servants across North Texas who
help ease the burden of last week’s torna-
does. When natural disaster strikes families
suffer. It takes a strong community to bring
hope out of the wreckage.
Communities with solid foundations do more
than just rebuild homes, businesses, and
schools, but also help relieve heartache that
follows catastrophic loss.
Countless faith-based and non-profit organi-
zations, including the Network of Community
Ministries, American Red Cross of North
Texas, and Texas Baptist Men have risen to
meet the needs of our community. Alongside
partners such as Atmos Energy and Oncor
Electric, they have started the arduous proc-
ess of helping rebuild our communities.
Likewise, city leaders including those in
Richardson and Dallas have banded together
to show support and provide valuable re-
sources proving once more, we are always
stronger together.
I ask my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in thanking volunteers
and leaders throughout our region, not only for
helping to bring relief to those who have been
displaced from their homes and schools, but
also for providing hope.

HONORING TINA INGRAM
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and
self-driven community servant, Tina Ingram.
Tina Ingram is a Yazoo City native. Tina
started her career as a young mother after
graduating from Yazoo City High School in
1986. She attended Phillips College where
she obtained a certification in Word Proc-
essing, which led to her first job in word proc-
essing at Deposit Guaranty Bank in Jackson
in 1987.
For eight years Tina commuted to Jackson
while she worked at Deposit Guaranty, and
also spent another two years in Jackson work-
ing for Allstate Insurance, but she missed
spending time at home with her children.
It was in January of 1999 that Tina was
given an opportunity to start working with
Bank of Yazoo as a part-time teller. By April
of the same year, she was working full-time
and has been with the Bank ever since.
During her tenure at Bank of Yazoo she has
worked in the loan department before becom-
ing a Vault Teller and a Customer Service
Representative at the Jerry Clower location.
Most recently Tina has been promoted to Tell-
er Manager of the Yazoo City and Flora
Branches.
While continuing her work at Bank of Yazoo,
Tina graduated from the Mississippi School of
Banking and earned her bachelor’s degree in
Business management from Belhaven Univer-
sity in 2016.
Tina has been married to Louis Ingram for
28 years. She is the mother of three. With
Proverbs 3:5–6 as her guiding light, Tina gives
all honor and glory to God for each success
that has blessed her life thus far.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in recognizing Tina Ingram for her hard
work, dedication and tenacity to serving oth-
ers.

HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Dr. David Schoem on
his retirement and recognize his twenty years
of distinguished service with the Michigan
Community Scholars Program at the Univer-
sity of Michigan. Dr. Schoem’s contributions to
the Michigan community are worthy of com-
mendation.
Dr. Schoem has dedicated his life to improv-
ing the lives of others. While attending high
school in a racially-divided Philadelphia, Dr.
Schoem developed an interest in intergroup
relations, aspiring to bring people together to
resolve conflicts and build a more just society.
Dr. Schoem brought his passion for conflict
resolution and unification to the University of
Michigan, where he received his under-
graduate degree. Upon completing his mas-
ter’s degree in education at Harvard University
and Ph.D. at University of California, Berkeley,
Dr. Schoem returned to the University of
Michigan, beginning his professional career
with the College of Literature, Science, and
the Arts in 1979.
Since joining the U-M faculty, Dr. Schoem
has become a pillar of the university. Through-
out his tenure, Dr. Schoem has impacted the
lives of thousands of students, serving as a
beloved professor in the Sociology Depart-
ment, LSA Assistant Dean for Undergraduate
Education, and U–M Assistance Vice Presi-
dent for Academic and Student Affairs. In ad-
dition, Dr. Schoem’s leadership as Director of

the Michigan Community Scholars Program
(MCSP)—a role he has held since 1999—has
been paramount to the learning community’s
continued success. For twenty years, Dr.
Schoem has worked tirelessly to unite stu-
dents and faculty who have a commitment to
community service, diversity, and academic
excellence. Dr. Schoem’s guidance and exper-
tise have inspired MCSP students not only to
strive for excellence in their studies, but in all
their future life pursuits. He truly has made a
difference in their lives.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring Dr. Schoem for his twenty
years of service to the Michigan Community
Scholars Program. We thank him for his out-
standing work and wish him the best of luck
in his future endeavors.

HONORING FAMILY CHRISTIAN
CENTER 25TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor a religious institution in my district that
has helped the community now for 25 years,
the Family Christian Center in New Rochelle.
FCC traces its roots to another part of my
district, Mount Vernon. Twenty-five years ago,
Bishop Mott and his wife Sherrie-Ann made a
decision to answer the call of God on their
lives. They had recently left the church where
they met and started their family. On a warm
Sunday in October 1994, they held their first
meeting in the basement of their Mt. Vernon
home with less than twenty people in attend-
ance. This was the birth of Spirit and Truth
International Ministries.
In April 1995, they moved their services
from their home to 38 East First St. in Mt.
Vernon, NY and seven months later, Reford
O. Mott was ordained as Pastor. The church
achieved growth after the move, however, it
seemed to reach its maximum number of 70,
as families rotated in and out of membership.
In December 1998, exactly three years after
the start of his ministry, Pastor Mott made his
first momentous decision to transition from a
part-time pastor to full-time pastor, giving up
his career as an MTA bus driver. This change
resulted in the church growing significantly,
from 70 members to 150 members in one
year. As a family man, Pastor Mott attracted
family-oriented people to the church. Spirit and
Truth International Ministries became a place
for families to be restored. The culture shift in-
spired Pastor Mott and his team to change the
name of the ministry to Family Christian Cen-
ter. The church continued to grow in the years
following. In 2016, Family Christian Center
moved into their very own property at 592
Main Street in New Rochelle. Today, Family
Christian Center is committed to partnering
with organizations in New Rochelle making it
a better place to live, work and conduct busi-
ness for all. Its congregation has grown to
over 550 members and represents a cross
section of the Greater New York area attract-
ing members from all over the tristate area.
Madam Speaker, on this special 25th Anni-
versary occasion, I want to congratulate
Bishop Reford, Pastor Sherrie-Ann Mott, and
the entire FCC congregation and family on a
wonderful 25 years of service to our commu-
nity.

RECOGNIZING ATLANTIC TECH-
NICAL HIGH SCHOOL AS A 2019
EXEMPLARY HIGH PERFORMING
SCHOOL
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Atlantic Technical High School of Co-
conut Creek, Florida as a 2019 National Blue
Ribbon School. Atlantic Technical was recog-
nized as an exemplary high performing school
by the Department of Education.
At Atlantic Technical, the use of technology
is incorporated into every aspect of education.
Small class sizes and encouraging teachers
embrace personalization among students. As
upperclassmen, students can also select from
a wide array of technical programs and even
receive college credits.
Atlantic Technical has been rated an ‘‘A’’
school for the past eight years. It also had the
honor of being recognized by The Washington
Post as one of ‘‘America’s Most Challenging
High Schools.’’ The school’s credentials sur-
pass Florida’s state academic requirements
and its unique design enables students to im-
merse themselves in a rigorous learning envi-
ronment that encourages them to pursue their
interests.
I ask that my colleagues today join me in
thanking Director Robert Crawford and the
staff at Atlantic Technical High School for the
amazing work they have done over the years
to educate, as well as the student body for
striving to be next generation of movers and
shakers in the community.

HONORING JUSTICE EUGENE
PREMO
HON. ZOE LOFGREN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize Justice Eugene Premo and com-
mend him on his 50th anniversary on the
bench.
Gene started his judicial career in 1969 in
San Jose, beginning 50 years of service,
when he was appointed to the Municipal Court
in Santa Clara Judicial District. He served in
that court for five years.
In December of 1974 he was elevated to
the Superior Court of Santa Clara County
where he served until October 1988. Elevated
to the 6th appellate district in September of
1988, he has served his community through
his dedicated service on the Court of Appeal.
I have known Gene for many years as a fel-
low alum from the University of Santa Clara
School of Law and from my years on the
Board of Supervisors of Santa Clara County.
Gene is someone who cares deeply about his
community, his family and the law. Unfailingly
fair, he is a person of the highest integrity. I
have fond memories of our many professional
and personal interactions while he served in
the Superior Court. His exemplary life makes
his family, his community and Santa Clara
Law School very proud.
Madam Speaker, the Congress joins Gene
in celebrating 50 years of service to justice,
the rule of law and the people of California.
The Santa Clara Bar Association will be hav-
ing their annual judges’ night on November
21st and plan to honor Gene for his achieve-
ments.

IN RECOGNITION OF JEFFREY
KNAUS’ CAREER WITH THE
PLUMBERS AND STEAMFITTERS
UNITED ASSOCIATION LOCAL 400
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Jeffrey Knaus of De Pere,
Wisconsin on celebrating his retirement from
the Plumbers and Steamfitters United Associa-
tion Local 400. His leadership in Wisconsin’s
trade industry is an excellent example of dedi-
cation to a craft and service to one’s commu-
nity.
Jeff began his career with Tweet-Garot Me-
chanical as a steamfitter in 1984 and joined
the Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 298 in
Green Bay. After completing his apprentice-
ship, Jeff served on the Steamfitter JAC and
as a night school instructor for UA Heritage
and Steward Training.
Jeff’s commitment to bettering his skills and
the industry led him to advance in leadership.
In 2001, he became full-time Business Rep-
resentative for the NorthEast WI Building and
Construction Trades Council and served until
January 2005 when he was elected Business
Agent for UA Local 400. When Locals 206,
298, 458 and 786 merged in 1998 to become
UA Local 400, Jeff was elected local union
president from 2002 to 2004. Jeff was then
appointed Assistant Business Manager in
2008 and elected Business Manager/Financial
Secretary-Treasurer in 2012.
As Business Manager for UA Local 400, Jeff
served as chairman of the Education and
Health Funds, President of the Fox River Val-
ley Pipe Trades Education Foundation and as
a trustee on UA Local 400’s DB pension plan
and profit sharing/401(k) plan. He has also
been assigned by the UA to serve on the Pipe
Fabrication Institute and to represent the UA
at the last five Metal Trades Department Con-
ferences.
Throughout his career, Jeff has committed
his time and energy to serving his community.
He has championed opportunities for veterans
within Local 400, and has been a strong pro-
ponent of the UA’s Veterans In Piping Pro-
gram. This program provides veterans with 18
weeks of accelerated training in the pipe
trades, including 6 weeks of classroom in-
struction combined with 12 weeks of on-the-
job training. Local 400, under Jeff’s leadership,
has also demonstrated a strong commitment
to youth education in our community, most re-
cently being recognized with the Heart of the
Valley Chamber of Commerce’s 2019 Busi-
ness Partner in Education Award.
Jeff has been a tireless advocate on behalf
of UA Local 400. He believed that the devel-
opment and success of Local 400 went hand

the community that have not only advanced
the interests of the members of Local 400, but
also strengthened the community it serves.

and dedication to Wisconsin’s 8th District and
its trades industry. I wish Jeff well as he
marks the conclusion of his proud career.

RICHARD STEIN & HILARY BAUM
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, it is my honor
to recognize two pillars of the Riverdale com-
munity, Hilary Baum and Richard Stein, who
this year are also being honored by the River-
dale Neighborhood House at their 2019 An-
nual Benefit.
Richard and Hilary are no strangers to Riv-
erdale Neighborhood House. In fact, the River-
dale Press was founded by Richie’s father,
Dave, in part to help raise funds for the RNH
pool. Richie’s first paid job was as a coun-
selor-in-training at the RNH camp. After get-
ting his degree in architecture in 1971, Rich-
ard began working on a geodesic dome teen
center for RNH and Hilary—whom Richie met
at Cornell—was enlisted as construction su-
perintendent. The couple recalls the project as
one of the most fulfilling experiences of their
lives.
After the dome, Richard and Hilary estab-
lished a design office in upstate Delhi, NY, but
in 1976 their country life was cut short when
Dave Stein’s worsening heart condition made
it difficult for him to continue at The Press. De-
spite vowing not to enter the family business,
Richie became General Manager of The
Press. Immersing himself in community affairs,
he soon joined the board of RNH where he is
still a member today. Over the years, he has
served as assistant treasurer, treasurer, sec-
retary and president.
Returning to New York City also gave Hilary
the opportunity to redefine her own career
path. After taking courses with famed land-
scape architect M. Paul Friedberg at City Col-
lege, she joined the staff of the Central Park
Administrator during the early years of the
park’s restoration and the launching of the
Central Park Conservancy, helping to estab-
lish the National Association of Olmsted
Parks. Later, she took a job with the New York
State Department of Agriculture and Markets
where she began to develop expertise that
eventually resulted in her forming Public Mar-
ket Partners and crisscrossing the continent,
consulting with towns and cities about creating
or revitalizing their markets. In 1995, she co-
authored her second book, Public Markets and
Community Revitalization. Her passion for
food and food equity also led to her working
to bring healthy, locally sourced food to lower
income neighborhoods commonly called ‘‘food
deserts.’’ In Riverdale, Hilary became a driving
force in the creation of the Hawthorne Valley
Farm community supported agriculture (CSA)
project at RNH and a board member at
Friends of Van Cortlandt Park.
Now that the couple has settled near their
grandchildren—Luca and Anaia—in Philadel-
phia, their professional lives have come full
circle. They are once again involved with ar-
chitecture and development, aided by their
daughter Annie, son Alex and son-in-law
Mauro Daigle.
Madam Speaker, Richie Stein and Hilary
Baum have done a great deal for our commu-
nity over the years. On this special occasion,
I want to congratulate and thank them for all
of their work.

HONORING DICK BOYSEN
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor the retirement
of Dick Boysen and his contributions to many
children and families.
Dick retired in June, after serving 41 years
at the helm of the Spokane Guild School, now
known as Joya Child and Family Develop-
ment. This organization provides valuable
early intervention services to children from
birth to age three who have developmental
delays and disabilities.
Dick’s commitment to the families in the
Spokane region is not limited to the 41 years
spent at Joya. Prior to starting in his role, he
was the education director for the Spokane
County Head Start Program. In 1977, a friend
encouraged him to apply for the Executive Di-
rector position. From there Dick went on to
spend his career making a daily difference in
the lives of children and their families.
His dedication to these families speaks for
itself. In the last year, 51 percent of the kids
attending Joya met developmental milestones
on or before their third birthday and graduated
from the program. Dick said ‘‘early intervention
is key because it is before age three when
children’s brains are better able to recover
from injuries or learn to rewire themselves.’’
My son Cole graduated from the Guild
school. It helped him tremendously and set
him on a strong path. We will always be grate-
ful for the start they gave him.
Dick is an inspiration to many, and we will
seek to continue on his legacy for many years
to come. We are all grateful for his example
and commitment to meeting the needs of
some of the most vulnerable in our commu-
nity.
I want to thank you to Dick for your years
of service to the Spokane community, our chil-
dren, and our families. His leadership will be
missed by those who had the opportunity to
work with him. His dedication is inspiring. I
wish him all of the best in his retirement.

HONORING U.S. ARMY COLONEL
(RETIRED) ELLIS WAYNE GOLSON
HON. MARTHA ROBY
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mrs. ROBY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor and provide tribute to the honorable
service to our Nation by a great Alabamian
and American. U.S. Army Colonel (Retired)
Ellis Wayne Golson of Dothan, Alabama will
retire from Department of Defense civilian
service on December 31, 2019 after 47 years
of continuous service to our nation.
Colonel Golson, originally from Evergreen,
Alabama entered the U.S. Military Academy at
West Point, New York in 1972. And since that
summer day long ago, Colonel Golson has
selflessly defended our country, culminating in
a second career of significant contribution as
a senior Director of future U.S. Army Aviation
capabilities at Fort Rucker, Alabama.
Colonel Golson served at home and abroad
in many demanding areas of command and
leadership. As an Army civilian, Colonel
Golson continued his leadership of our de-
fense as the Director of all Army Aviation
Combat Developments, a critical and essential
position developing future Army helicopters.
Colonel Golson has been joined in his life’s
work by his life’s partner, Rachel. Rachel has
always supported Ellis as she lent her experi-
ence, compassion and precious time in the
volunteer support of Soldiers, civilians and
military family members through victories as
well as unit losses and other very personal
tragedies.
I am honored to pay tribute and post to the
record a lifetime of honorable service, commit-
ment and great contribution to our Nation’s de-
fense provided by Colonel and Mrs. Ellis
Golson. Together they faithfully served and set
the conditions for both military and personal
success for those that will follow. May God
continue to bless Ellis and Rachel Golson in
retirement as well as all of our military mem-
bers who continue to protect the United States
of America.

HONORING HARRIET SMITH
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor a resourceful
and ambitious woman, Ms. Harriet Smith. Har-
riet has shown what can be done through hard
work, dedication and a desire to serve others.
Ms. Harriet Smith, a Yazoo City native, is
the daughter of Derrick and Beverly Young
and great granddaughter of the late Harry
Young, who she was named after.
Smith grew up in Yazoo City but moved to
Jackson during her third-grade year. After
graduating from Ridgeland High School, she
joined the Air Force Reserves and trained on
the weekends while attending Hinds Commu-
nity College. She later attended Jackson State
University, where she earned a bachelor’s de-
gree in English with a concentration in Edu-
cation in 2015.
As a teacher, Smith trained at Murrah High
School, learning from the teachers who edu-
cated her while she was a student there. She
also taught in Memphis before realizing that
there was another calling in her life; to pro-
mote community literacy with library programs.
She became the children’s librarian at Ricks
Memorial Library in Yazoo City on March 14,
2019.
While this is Smith’s first year working in a
library setting, she plans to use her knowledge
and techniques from the classroom to pursue
her dream. Her goals during her first year are
to make reading a priority at home for children

in the community, to enable more students to

rate with class room teachers on how to im-
prove literacy among their students.
She has already established new reading
programs at Ricks Library such as preschool
reading times in the morning, and story times
and other children’s activities in the afternoon.
She is also planning to make visits to many
child care centers and schools to promote lit-
eracy.

passion and dedication to serving our great
Country, desiring to make a difference in the

HONORING THE REMARKABLE
LIFE AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF
MS. SHIRLEY CAYLOR
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with
great admiration and respect that I stand be-
fore you today to honor Ms. Shirley Caylor
and to wish her well upon her retirement. For
her lifetime of inspiring service to those most
in need, she is worthy of the highest praise.
Throughout her noteworthy and important ca-
reer, Shirley’s compassionate work has been
a beacon of hope for the community of North-
west Indiana and beyond.
In 1971, Shirley Caylor and her late hus-
band, Reverend Capp, founded the Youth Cri-
sis Center, which later became ‘‘Crisis Center,
Inc., a Youth Service Bureau.’’ The organiza-
tion began as a youth-based crisis and suicide
hotline and remains active today, operating as
part of the National Suicide Prevention Life-
line. This hotline has helped thousands of
people during its forty-five years of operation
and was where Shirley began her lifetime of
service.
Under the outstanding leadership of Shirley
and Reverend Capp, the Crisis Center contin-
ued to grow and expand its services and pro-
grams. In 1974, they added a community
counseling center, and in 1976, Alternative
House, a short-term shelter for homeless,
abused, or neglected youth was established.
The Crisis Center also added the Teen Court
program to its growing list of services in 1989.
This innovative intervention program works to
assist teenagers who have been brought into
the juvenile detention system by allowing them
to serve as jurors. Later, in 2016, Ms. Caylor
opened Promises, the Crisis Center’s first
long-term care residential program for teen-
agers. Additionally, Ms. Caylor and Reverend
Capp worked tirelessly to ensure that the Na-
tional Safe Place program was available to
Lake and Porter County residents through the
Crisis Center, as well as to the Hoosiers state-
wide through the Indiana Youth Services As-
sociation. This program provides easy access
to emergency shelter, counseling, and other
types of assistance. Today, the Crisis Center’s
Safe Place program includes three hundred
and seventy-six safe place locations.
I respect Shirley Caylor with all my heart. In
the truest sense of the word, she is a servant
of all, but especially of the most vulnerable.
When one reads Isaiah 58:10, one is com-
pelled to think of Shirley Caylor: ‘‘And if you
spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry and
satisfy the needs of the oppressed, then your
light will rise in the darkness, and your night
will become like the noonday.’’ Her light has il-
luminated our way. Her life is one we should
emulate.
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my
other colleagues join me in honoring Shirley
Caylor for her extraordinary career and service
to the youth of Northwest Indiana and to wish
her well upon her retirement. Shirley’s impact
on the region will be witnessed by generations
to come, and for her many contributions, she
is worthy of our utmost gratitude and apprecia-
tion.

HONORING BRONX BETHANY
CHURCH OF THE NAZARENE 55TH
ANNIVERSARY
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I want to take
the opportunity to recognize a special religious
institution in my district which is celebrating its
55th Anniversary this year, the Bronx Bethany
Church of the Nazarene.
Bronx Bethany Church has a storied history.
In the early 1960’s, a small group of Jamaican
nationals migrated to the United States and
settled in the Bronx. They searched for a
church where they could worship and have a
sense of belonging. They attempted to be-
come members of a church in York City but
were rejected because of their ethnicity. De-
spite their disappointments, and instead of
cursing the dark, they lit a candle deciding to
gather together for worship in their homes.
The decision was made within the group to
start a church. Rev. V. Seymour Cole was in-
troduced to the group by a mutual friend. The
small group subsequently asked Rev. Cole to
shepherd them. Having studied in the Mid-
west, he was familiar with the Church of the
Nazarene and recommended affiliation with
the denomination.
In 1964, with 21 charter members, Bronx
Bethany Church was formally organized and
became affiliated with the Church of the Naza-
rene. In the first 13 years of the church, Rev.
Cole commuted from Connecticut—approxi-
mately 60 miles each way—in order to ensure
the establishment of the fledgling church. Rev.
Cole tirelessly and effectively pastored this
congregation for 36 years before retiring and
turning over the pulpit in 2000 to Rev. Dr.
Samuel Vassel. Dr. Vassel was installed as
Pastor in September 2000 and has continued
the legacy of rich Bible preaching. The Church
continues to grow spiritually and numerically,
and God has gifted our community with an
abundance of gifts.
Madam Speaker, on this special occasion, I
want to congratulate Dr. Vassel and the entire
congregation of Bronx Bethany Church on 55
amazing years in the Bronx.
RECOGNIZING DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
today, I rise in recognition of Domestic Vio-
lence Awareness Month. In my home state of
Texas, we are unfortunately deeply familiar
with the tragedies involved in domestic vio-
lence. Families have been broken apart, and
people have lost their lives to the scourge of
domestic violence. We have the duty to do
more to protect the most vulnerable members
of our communities.
According to the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention, nearly 1 in 5 adult women
and about 1 in 7 adult men are reported to
have experienced severe physical violence
from an intimate partner. In the state of Texas,
one in three adult Texans have experienced
intimate partner violence in their lifetime, ac-
cording to a study by the Institute of Domestic
and Sexual Assault at the University of Texas
at Austin.
As representatives of Americans from all
corners of our country, we know that domestic
violence is not unique to any one part of our
nation. It is widespread and engrossing, and
our response to it must also measure up to
the significance of the challenge. Americans
today need protections and assistance to re-
cover from domestic violence, so that they
may achieve full and prosperous lives.
Congress must uphold our sacred obligation
to protect the millions of victims and survivors
who need and deserve our whole-hearted and
full support. Therefore, I am proud to support
Domestic Violence Awareness Month.

Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, it is
my great honor to rise today in celebration of
Filipino American History Month. During this
month of October, we take the time to recog-
nize and commend the innumerable contribu-
tions of our Filipino-Americans. As Filipino
American History Month comes to an end, it is
important that we reflect on the historical
events that that have enriched our island and
our country into prosperity.
The island of Guam and the Philippine na-
tion share a mirrored colonial history, having
both been under Spanish rule for hundreds of
years and later governed by the United States.
At the end of World War II seventy-five years
ago, many Filipinos left their families and their
homes to help rebuild Guam from the destruc-
tion left by the Imperial Japanese’s three-year
occupation of the island. Filipinos continue to
bring their expertise in construction and labor
to the island in the wake of man-made and
natural disasters, for this we are grateful.
Today, Filipinos on Guam remain a true pil-
lar of our community. They continue to play

vital roles by providing professional and eco-
nomic support in the fields of healthcare, edu-
cation, and infrastructure. With Filipinos proud-
ly being the second largest ethnic demo-
graphic on Guam, one can easily discover
unique Filipino hubs filled with Filipino cuisine,
fashion, and pop culture throughout Guam.
Furthermore, their significant contributions are
evidenced through the many community orga-

The peoples of the Philippines and Guam’s

striving to do good for all, (inafa’maolek) has
been easily achieved and manifested in the
melting pot of Guam due to the strong rela-
tionship fostered by the Filipino Community in
Guam and the people of Guam.
Madam Speaker, I am honored to reflect
upon the rich history & contributions of Fili-
pino-Americans. Throughout America’s history,
present, and future, the Filipino community
has played and will continue to play a major
role in enriching the quality of life for the peo-
ple of the United States, and for their out-
standing contributions they are worthy of our
respect and gratitude. On behalf of the People
of Guam, I extend our great thanks (un

in Guam and across our nation.

RECOGNIZING NATTY ELIAS
HON. DONNA E. SHALALA
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of the accomplishments of
Ms. Natty Elias, the founder and President of
Healthtex Distributors.
Over 30 years ago, Ms. Elias, took special
interest in the large influx of Hispanics arriving
to South Florida from Latin America. Having
immigrated herself in the early 1960’s from her
native Cuba, Ms. Elias understood immigrant
desire and nostalgia for products from their
homeland. It was with this understanding and
with the goal to fill that need that she
launched Healthtex Distributors.
Despite initial push back from American re-
tailers, Ms. Elias eventually grew her business
from one product line into nearly 2,000 prod-
ucts imported from over a dozen countries
around the world. Today, Healthtex Distribu-
tors is the largest distributor of Hispanic prod-
ucts in the state of Florida and her products
are sold at over 4,000 stores across the coun-
try.
Through years of hard work and dedication,
Ms. Elias has distinguished herself as one of
the leading business women in our South Flor-
ida community.

HONORING CPL. MORRIS D. LINK
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, it is my privi-
lege to honor the life of an American hero,
Corporal Morris D. Link, who is buried at the
historic cemetery at St. Paul’s Church in
Mount Vernon, New York.
A Mount Vernon native, Cpl. Link served in
World War I with the legendary 369th Infantry,
an all-black regiment known as the Harlem
Hellfighters, and was killed in action, receiving
the French War Cross. Early on the morning
of July 15, 1918, the 369th came under heavy
artillery bombardment, part of the Second Bat-
tle of the Marne, as the French struggled to
hold off a German offensive. The shells fell
with particular ferocity on the front-line trench-
es, which were held by Link and soldiers of
the regiment’s Company K. Cpl. Link was
among four soldiers killed in the action. Link
was one of 85 Mt. Vernon soldiers killed dur-
ing World War I. The city planted trees in
honor of each of the fallen, and the sapling
commemorating Link was based on Wallace
Avenue at the intersection with Westchester
Avenue.
Cpl. Link was one of the unit’s earliest vol-
unteers. He was born in North Carolina in
1883 and moved to Mount Vernon in the early
20th century where he lived with his wife
Lizzie. Following his death in combat, Cpl.
Link was interred in a French military ceme-
tery, though three years later his remains were
brought back to Mount Vernon for final burial.
Cpl. Link’s final resting place is memorialized
with a veteran’s stone.
October 12th of this year marks the 100th
Anniversary of Cpl. Link’s reinternment into
the Mount Vernon Saint Paul Cemetery.
Madam Speaker, on this solemn occasion, I
am privileged to honor the memory of Cpl.
Morris Link and all of the veterans who served
and lost their lives from Mount Vernon and
throughout my district. We owe them an eter-
nal debt.

PREVENTING ONLINE SALES OF E-
CIGARETTES TO CHILDREN ACT
SPEECH OF
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR.
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, October 28, 2019
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak
on H.R. 3942, the Preventing Online Sales of
E-Cigarettes to Children Act. As the Chairman
of the Energy and Commerce Committee,
which has jurisdiction over the Food and Drug
Administration’s regulation of tobacco prod-
ucts, I ardently support efforts to protect Amer-
ica’s youth from a life of tobacco use, nicotine
addiction, and its negative consequences.
It is an unfortunate reality that nearly all to-
bacco use begins during youth and young
adulthood. Research shows that 95 percent of
adult smokers begin smoking before age 21
and 80 percent start before age 18. This is
alarming to me, and should be alarming to ev-
eryone, because this is a crucial period for
brain development. More worrisome is the fact
that adolescent brains are more sensitive to
nicotine, therefore young people may be more
likely to develop a dependence on nicotine
than adults.
In recent years, online sales for e-cigarette
products, including flavored e-cigarette prod-
ucts that are appealing to kids, are putting a
new generation at risk of a lifetime of chronic
health conditions and disease associated with
nicotine addiction. Further, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention warns that e-
cigarette products can contain other harmful
substances besides nicotine. Other than a few
clicks of the mouse, we have few meaningful
barriers to stop young Americans from pur-
chasing these tobacco products online.
That is why I support efforts to stop the flow
of online tobacco sales. And while H.R. 3942
would require online age verification for the
purchase and delivery of certain tobacco prod-
ucts, among other things, I believe this bill
does not go far enough. If our aim is to pre-
vent youth from purchasing these products on-
line, then I firmly believe we should enact a
complete ban against remote retail sales of all
tobacco products, including e-cigarettes and e-
cigarette accessories. This would mean that
individuals wishing to purchase tobacco prod-
ucts would have to do so in a face to face set-
ting, providing a stronger barrier to youth pur-
chase.
We should not focus alone on online sales
though if our goal is to help reduce youth ac-
cess and attraction to tobacco. I also believe
we should take the following additional steps;
raising the purchasing age to 21, enacting an
across the board ban on all flavored tobacco
products, including mint and menthol, and re-
stricting the ability of tobacco and e-cigarette
manufacturers to utilize deceptive marketing
tactics to hook a new generation. That is why,
this fall, I intend to move legislation I have au-
thored—H.R. 2339, the Reversing the Youth
Tobacco Epidemic of 2019—that contains
these provisions among others. Taken to-
gether I believe these provisions would be the
most meaningful step forward in working to re-
verse the damaging youth tobacco epidemic
that is underway.
We are in a complicated epidemic of youth
e-cigarette use, and this complex problem
calls for a comprehensive, multifaceted solu-
tion. I thank my colleagues for offering up
tools to fix the abundance of youth tobacco
use, but believe we must take every step pos-
sible, including prohibiting all non-face-to-face
sales in order to address this public health cri-
sis.

authorities onto buses and charged with ‘‘pa-

IN RECOGNITION OF LAWRENCE
UNIVERSITY’S 150TH ANNIVER-
SARY WITH THE FEDERAL DE-
POSITORY LIBRARY PROGRAM
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the 150th anniversary of
Lawrence University’s partnership with the
Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP)
administered by the U.S. Government Pub-
lishing Office (GPO).
In 1860, Congress established the GPO to
provide and preserve information about the
federal government to Congress. The GPO’s
authority was later expanded through legisla-
tion in 1895, making the agency responsible
for not only printing for all three branches of
government, but also distributing government
publications to designated libraries to provide
information about the federal government to
the public. Thus, the Federal Depository Li-
brary Program began. Today, the FDLP dis-
tributes government documents to nearly
1,159 libraries.
The Seeley G. Mudd Library is the oldest
FDLP library among all universities and col-
leges in Wisconsin. Its collections of Congres-
sional records and government documents in-
clude historical treasures unique among all
FDLP libraries in the state. The Fox Valley
and students of Lawrence University are fortu-
nate to have a resource like the Seeley G.
Mudd Library in our community. I am grateful
to Lawrence University for pioneering Wiscon-
sin’s partnership with the FLDP, and to the
Seeley G. Mudd Library for preserving treas-
ured government documents for the commu-
nity.
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to congratu-
late Lawrence University as the Seeley G.
Mudd Library celebrates this impressive mile-
stone.

COMMEMORATING TREE PLANTING
IN HONOR OF PRESIDENT THEO-
DORE ROOSEVELT
HON. J. FRENCH HILL
OF ARKANSAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to commemorate the tree I was able
to plant this morning on U.S. Capitol grounds
in honor of President Theodore Roosevelt and
his important influence on conservation.
Republicans quote him. Democrats quote
him. He’s on Mount Rushmore. He left a leg-
acy of having written more than thirty-five
books, 150,000 letters and countless articles.
As president, he used his authority to estab-
lish 150 national forests, 51 federal bird re-
serves, four national game preserves, five na-
tional parks, 18 national monuments, and des-
ignated over 200 million acres as national for-
ests, yet no tree here on the U.S. Capitol
grounds honors our transformational 26th
president.
In 1907, Roosevelt penned a letter to school
children in honor of Arbor Day, saying ‘‘a peo-
ple without children would face a hopeless fu-
ture; a country without trees is almost as help-
less.’’
A Greek proverb tells us that ‘‘a society
grows great when old men plant trees whose
shade they know they shall never sit in.’’
It is my hope that our future youth and Cap-
itol visitors will now enjoy the beauty and
shade of this tree and that the important influ-
ence of President Roosevelt will continue well
into the 22nd century and beyond.

HONORING PASTOR MARVIN
HENK’S 45TH ANNIVERSARY AS
PASTOR
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
mark a special anniversary in the community,
as St. John’s Evangelical Lutheran Church in
Mamaroneck is celebrating Pastor Marvin
Henk’s 45th year as a pastor.
Pastor Henk was born in Salisbury, Mary-
land and grew up in both Des Plaines, Illinois
and Freemont, California. He is a graduate of
Valparaiso University, the Lutheran School of
Theology of Chicago, Union Theological Semi-
nary in New York, and Princeton Theological
Seminary.
Pastor Henk was ordained at Trinity Lu-
theran Church, Staten Island in 1974, and
served there as associate pastor and religion
instructor until 1978. In 1978, he became pas-
tor of St. John’s Lutheran Church in Mamaro-
neck. For 40 years in Mamaroneck, Pastor
Henk has served as a spiritual leader in the
community. But his involvement goes beyond
the church. He volunteers on the Board of
Greenwood Union Cemetery Board in Rye and
as a Chaplain to the Mamaroneck Fire and
Police Departments. He has also served on
the Board of Directors of the Rye YMCA and
the Samaritan Counseling Center in Rye. In
addition, Pastor Henk has volunteered on the
Ethics Committee for the Village of Mamaro-
neck, the Committee for Immigration and His-
panic Relations in Mamaroneck, and on var-
ious ELCA committees.
When not serving his congregants and
neighbors, Pastor Henk enjoys sailing, watch-
ing baseball, running the New York City Mara-
thon—which he’s done three times—and play-
ing racquetball. He also loves to travel, some-
thing I as Chair of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee can appreciate.
But Pastor Henk’s greatest love in family.
He is married to his lovely wife, Kathleen, who
is a teacher at Rye Presbyterian Nursery
School. Together they have two daughters,
Erin and Allison.
Madam Speaker, as Representative for New
York’s 16th District, it is my honor to recognize
Pastor Henk on this special occasion. Con-
gratulations to him on 45 years as pastor.
HONORING EVA JONES
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable
public servant, Mrs. Eva Jones who has been
a servant leader for most of her adult life. She
began in her church organizing health fairs,
women empowerment sessions, teen summits,
and domestic abuse conferences that focused
on raising awareness and ending dating and
sexual assault violence in the Metro Jackson
community. After raising her three sons, Mrs.
Jones returned to college as an adult learner
and earned a B.S. in Criminal Justice and So-
ciology from Mississippi College to enhance
her knowledge in order to help women, men,
and children who are victims and survivors of
abuse and violence.
In 2010, Mrs. Jones founded Butterflies by
Grace Defined by Faith, an organization that
strives to educate, empower, and advocate
awareness to change the hearts of people and
propose policy and legislation to protect vic-
tims and survivors of sexual assault, human
trafficking, and domestic violence. Butterflies
by Grace Defined by Faith also strives to em-
power individuals and educate the community
to create social change within the community.
Butterflies by Grace Defined by Faith is a true
ministry which has changed hundreds of lives.
Mrs. Jones has had the privilege to serve
and volunteer on various boards and organiza-
tions such as the American Medical Tech-
nologist, Sickle Cell Foundation, SIDS, Diabe-
tes Foundation, Mississippi Coalition Against
Sexual Assault, the Susan Komen Breast
Cancer and many more. She has been hon-
ored by many civic organizations and most re-
cently Black Girls Rock, AMT Distinguished
Achievement Award, National Visionary Award
and Hero of the Year Award recipient. Mrs.
Jones is an active member of her church and
has worked as a registered medical assistant

the state of Michigan.
James was born on June 30, 1992. The
youngest of his siblings, James excelled as an
athlete and obtained the rank of Eagle Scout
before graduating from Forest Hills Central
High School. Upon graduation, James enlisted
in the United States Army. He completed his
basic training at Fort Knox and was assigned
to the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg,

North Carolina. James served in Afghanistan
in 2012, where he was deployed to the
Kandahar Valley. Throughout his service
abroad, James was invaluable to his brothers
in uniform, and he took great joy in the work
he did for nearby villages. Following his return
home, James married his wife Emalyn in
2013, and joined the Army Reserve, serving
with the 321st Psychological Operations Bat-
talion in Grand Rapids. Seeking to further
serve his fellow Michiganders, James entered
the State Police Training Academy and grad-
uated in July 2018 as Trooper No. 1615.
Despite his unforgettable sense of humor
and unique ability to bring joy to others,
James hid his struggle with Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder. On October 22, 2019, James
took his own life. Even after his death, James
was dedicated to the public good as his or-
gans and tissue were used to save the lives
of six fellow Americans. As we look for solace
after this tragedy, I want to express my heart-
felt condolences to his family and friends.
James’ tireless devotion to the public good
has touched the lives of countless
Michiganders, and the impact of his work can-
not be overstated.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Michigan’s
First Congressional District, I ask you to join
me in honoring the life of James Oliver Twist.
His legacy will forever live on in his family and
through the countless lives he bettered
through his service.

HONORING SAINT PETER’S
BAPTIST CHURCH
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Saint Peter’s Baptist Church in
Pascagoula, MS which will be celebrating its
200th anniversary. The founding of this church
tells the story of Mr. Dudley Brooks, who was
a former slave that gained his freedom by sav-
ing the life of his master’s wife. Mr. Brooks
then went on to work as a ship caulker so he
could save up money, eventually buying his
wife’s freedom in Louisiana. Together, they
traveled back to Scranton, presently known as
Pascagoula, where they built their home on
Market Street.
Mr. Brooks started by gathering a small
group of community members to worship in
his home which eventually transformed into
the First Free Mission Baptist Church, later in-
stalling Reverend George Washington as the
first pastor. The congregation soon outgrew
the Brooks’ home as worshippers traveled
from Gautier by boat to attend the church, re-
quiring the church to move the service under-
neath a huge oak tree on Market Street, pres-
ently known as Canal Street. With the oak
tree’s roots serving as pews for family mem-
bers, and a small ship’s bell fastened to the
tree churchgoers would summon worshippers
to join their service by ringing the bell. While
times were tough and money was limited,
members of the congregation were able to
raise $250 to purchase a 200 ft. by 60 ft. lot.
While Mr. Brooks and the congregation were
unable to write at the time the church was es-
tablished, the story of the church’s beginnings
have been passed down through generations.
The new church purchased a larger bell and
placed it in the tree where the old ship’s bell
hung. While the church has since moved loca-
tions, the larger bell still hangs from an oak
tree on Canal Street. Mr. Dudley Brooks’ hard-
ships are a real test of the human spirit, and
through his determination, he created some-
thing that would continue to touch lives on the
Mississippi Gulf Coast for centuries. His story
is a true miracle and inspiration to us all. I
want to congratulate the members of Saint
Peter’s Baptist Church for continuing to build
on the foundation laid by Mr. Brooks and
Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior.

TRIBUTE TO MILDRED L.
HARPOLE
HON. GWEN MOORE
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay
tribute to the life and legacy of Mildred L.
Harpole a highly esteemed change agent and
civil rights leader. A Native of Cleveland, Ohio,
Mildred came to Milwaukee to earn her bach-
elor’s degree from Marquette University, and
later her juris doctorate from now Case West-
ern Reserve University in Ohio. During her
brief time away, she married Reuben Harpole
the love of her life and returned to Milwaukee
to raise their family.
Upon her return in the early 1960s, Mildred
would become an educator for Milwaukee
Public Schools (MPS). With very few cur-
riculum materials, and children lacking reading
skills, she unlocked their desire to learn by en-
gaging them in everyday media. By using
newspapers, popular music, and television
shows, she helped students read and inform
themselves on current events, and literature
styles. Mildred simultaneously became en-
gaged in the fight to end segregation in MPS
with the Milwaukee United School Integration
Committee (MUSIC). Like other demonstra-
tions during the Civil Rights era, Mildred
helped organize several ‘‘Freedom Schools’’
that ran parallel to the boycott. These grass-
roots schools were designed to be a sup-
portive environment for her students with inno-
vative teaching, learning, and liberated think-
ing for African American children. ‘‘I don’t feel
that it was productive for children to sit home
or be on the street during the boycott.’’ Mil-
dred often recalled. She would go on to ad-
minister and establish the foundation for the
Harambee Community School that cultivated
generations of students for more than forty
years.
Mildred understood that there was a direct
link between educational opportunity and
housing policy and became the Director of
Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity in the Mil-
waukee office of the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development. Her work
updating national fair housing standards and
providing access to shelter for the underprivi-
leged and homeless received extensive rec-
ognition from policy makers, developers and
community groups. Mildred also served as
chair of the health committee for the
Harambee Health Center and was awarded a
$5 million grant from the Robert Woods John-
son Foundation and members of Fisk Univer-
sity for the City of Milwaukee to expand their
operations.
Mildred’s deep commitment to supporting
our community was done consistently with hu-
mility and persistence. She was the National
President of Eta Phi Beta an affiliate of the
National Council of Negro Women, co-founder
of the Community Brainstorming Conference,
Family Service of Milwaukee, the women’s
leadership forum TEMPO Milwaukee, as well
as the founding President of the North Central
Service Club. Mildred was also a member of
Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, the City of Mil-
waukee Arts Board, the Milwaukee County
Cultural Artistic and Musical Programming Ad-
visory Council and a charter member of the
Cream City Links, Inc.
She was also the recipient of the Vatican II
Award from the Milwaukee Archdiocese for
service in society, the Southeastern Wisconsin
Chapter of the Association of Fundraising Pro-
fessionals National Philanthropy Day—Todd
Wehr Volunteer Award and the City of Milwau-
kee’s Frank P. Zeidler Public Service Award
with her husband.
Mildred never did anything for a title or rec-
ognition, but because it was the right thing to
do. She understood that though this world is
imperfect, what we do with our lives can cre-
ate a better one. Her career as an educator
and housing advocate was done intentionally
to lift future generations of African Americans
and underserved communities, so that they
may reach for the sky. Till the end of her days
she never stopped lifting and her legacy will
have lasting impacts. I am proud to say Mil-
dred was my friend and she and Reuben were
a part of my support network. I will cherish the
memories of working with her over the years.
She leaves behind her husband Reuben, chil-
dren Anette and John, and grandchildren to
cherish her memory.
Madam Speaker, for these reasons I rise to
salute Mildred Harpole, a fierce woman whose
actions made the 4th Congressional District,
the State of Wisconsin and the world a better
place.

Wednesday, October 30, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, it is my honor
to recognize a good friend and community
leader in my district who this year is turning 75
years old, Bishop Angelo Rosario of the
Bronx. Bishop Rosario and his wife, Bishop
Nancy Rosario, have served as Pastors of
Church of God’s Children in Co-op City since
1990. He has been in Pastoral Ministry for
over 50 years. Bishop Rosario is the President
and Founder of the United Clergy Coalition
and CEO of the Bronx Clergy Task Force from
the Bronx Borough President’s Office of Faith
Based Initiatives. He is also a former chairman
of Community Board 10 in the Bronx. Bishop
Rosario completed his studies in Theology
and Pastoral Counseling at the Inter-American
Theological University.
Bishop Rosario’s ministries have a well-
earned reputation for helping those in the
community through spiritual and education
programming. This includes classes, after-
school programs, spiritual counseling, job
placement services and health services. He
has also been instrumental in developing
many community wide events and activities in
Co-op City, including Youth Day, the United
Day of Prayer, and several different inter-
national relief funds. Joining Bishop Rosario
every step of the way has been Nancy, their
10 children—four of whom are pastors them-
selves—and many grandchildren.
Madam Speaker, Co-op City and the Bronx
is fortunate to have Bishop Rosario as a lead-
er in the community. As he celebrates his 75th
birthday, I want to wish him and his family all
of the best. I thank him for his years of dedi-
