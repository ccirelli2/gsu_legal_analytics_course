PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Mighty God, hear our prayer. Be-
cause of Your mercies, give us the wis-
dom to strive to please You.
Continue to effectually work through
our lawmakers to accomplish Your
purposes. Lord, strengthen them to
catapult the hurdles that threaten true
freedom.
Grant that in all our perplexities, we
will seek Your truth. Lord, may we
hear the thunder of Your justice min-
gled with the showers of Your grace.
Preserve our lawmakers even during
turbulent seasons.
We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The President pro tempore led the
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
HAWLEY). The Senator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to address the Sen-
ate for 1 minute as in morning busi-
ness.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
RENEWABLE FUELS
Mr. GRASSLEY. Last week,
Siouxland Energy, an ethanol plant in
Sioux Center, IA, announced that they
are halting production due to the un-
fair small refinery exemptions.
This farmer-owned plant was annu-
ally buying 23.4 million bushels of corn
from farmers in the area, and it also
employed 42,000 people who, today, do
not know when they will be able to go
back to work. This kind of economic
impact is a big deal in rural commu-
nities. If it spreads, it is going to cre-
ate a lot of unemployment and closed
ethanol plants in other places around
the country. I have heard of production
halts announced in other States as
well.
In fact, the ethanol industry supports
more than 365,000 total jobs, and the
biodiesel industry supports more than
65,000 total jobs. We have made great
progress through the Renewable Fuel
Standard in diversifying our Nation’s
fuel supply while creating jobs and
strengthening local economies.
We have to get this issue settled. I
hope we can get an announcement from
the EPA very soon about that so we
can get these plants open and get these
people back to work.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY
LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader is recognized.
f
UKRAINE
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, over
the weekend, details emerged about
President Trump’s conduct with
Ukrainian President Zelensky. Specifi-
cally, the President’s phone calls with
the Ukrainian leader were subject of an
official whistleblower complaint by a
member of the intelligence commu-
nity. The intelligence community’s in-
spector general, a Trump appointee,
has determined that this whistle-
blower’s complaint is credible and a
matter of urgent concern, whose sub-
ject matter ‘‘not only falls within the
DNI’s jurisdiction, but relates to one of
the most significant and important of
the DNI’s responsibilities to the Amer-
ican people.’’
By law, a whistleblower complaint
labeled in this way must be trans-
mitted to Congress—not shall be trans-
mitted to Congress, must be. The
Trump administration has not allowed
that to happen. So far, in the face of
this dire warning and the Trump ad-
ministration’s effort to cover it up, the
Republican-led Senate has remained si-
lent and submissive, shying away from
this institution’s constitutional duty
to conduct oversight.
That is an obligation we have. It is
not a yes or no. That is our job. The
Republicans are in the majority in the
Senate. With that majority comes the
power to call hearings, issue sub-
poenas, and decide what legislation

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5618 September 23, 2019
comes to the floor. The majority in the
Senate, therefore, has an obligation to
consider and act on the Senate’s be-
half, particularly when it comes to
matters of oversight and matters of
separation of powers. Yet, so far, we
have no indication that Senate Repub-
licans are planning to act. Most have
yet to speak out.
The Republican Senate’s ‘‘see no evil,
hear no evil’’ attitude is unacceptable
and must change. Again, this is an
issue of solemn obligation. There is no
wiggle room here—none. The obliga-
tion of the inspector general is to turn
over the whistleblower information
now that he has found it credible and
urgent. And here, typically, our Senate
Republicans and the Senate leader sit
supinely in obeisance to Donald
Trump’s reckless lawbreaking.
This is a democracy, and we have
heard nothing from our Republican col-
leagues about what the President has
done, as abhorrent as that is, and the
stonewalling of information. What is
the President afraid of in this whistle-
blower report? We don’t know; we can
only speculate. But we do know there
is an obligation for it to come to Con-
gress.
So today I sent the Republican lead-
er, Senator MITCH MCCONNELL, a letter
calling on him and the Republican
chairs of the Senate relevant commit-
tees to fulfill their constitutional du-
ties and immediately take the fol-
lowing actions:
One, convene hearings to determine
exactly what prompted the whistle-
blower to file this urgent complaint. At
a minimum, these hearings should in-
clude testimony from Acting Director
of National Intelligence Joseph
Maguire, Acting Office of Management
and Budget Director Russell Vought,
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and
President Trump’s private attorney,
Rudy Giuliani, among others.
Two, issue a subpoena to compel the
delivery of the whistleblower com-
plaint to Congress as required—re-
quired—by law.
Three, request the White House to re-
lease the transcript of President
Trump’s conversation with Ukrainian
President Zelensky during which Presi-
dent Trump reportedly pressured the
Government of Ukraine to investigate
Vice President Biden and his family.
Four, identify the administration of-
ficials who directed that $341 million of
security assistance to Ukraine be de-
layed, and request that all records re-
lated to this decision be turned over to
Congress.
Five, insist that the Department of
Justice provide any legal opinion or
other guidance it has given regarding
the administration’s obligation to
transmit the whistleblower complaint
to Congress.
It is the Senate’s duty to take this
national security matter seriously and
investigate now. Senate Republicans
have the sole power and the over-
whelming responsibility to see that it
does. How long must we wait for our
Republican colleagues to rise up to
their responsibilities to the Constitu-
tion, to separation of powers, and to
rule of law when President Trump bra-
zenly violates that law? When are we
going to hear the voices? It is unbeliev-
able.
As President Trump erodes the very
fabric of this democracy, our Repub-
lican colleagues—I believe out of fear—
do nothing. That is not a profile in
courage. That is not even what Senator
after Senator, for generation after gen-
eration, regardless of party, has done.
But we are obviously in a new era here
where, on the Republican side, any-
thing Donald Trump wants to do, he
can get away with, whether or not it
violates the law, violates our prin-
ciples, violates the grand traditions of
this democratic Republic.
f
DECLARATION OF NATIONAL
EMERGENCY
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on a
somewhat related matter, again about
President Trump’s overreach and lack
of respect for any rule of law, Senate
Republicans will be forced to vote later
this week on the President’s emer-
gency declaration, which he is using to
steal money from our military to fund
a border wall that he promised Mexico
would pay for. Again, my Republican
colleagues face a choice about whether
to have the Senate enforce its role as a
check on the executive branch.
By declaring a national emergency,
the President has tried to go around
the constraints of his office to spend
taxpayer dollars the way he wants in-
stead of the way the Congress appro-
priates. Remember, Congress has ex-
plicitly and repeatedly rejected the
President’s request for border wall
funding. Now he is trying to improp-
erly take it from funds elsewhere—in
this case, the military.
The Constitution dictates that Con-
gress alone has the power of the purse.
Will my Republican colleagues vote to
reassert those constitutional powers,
or will they buckle to the pressure of
partisan loyalty to the President?
And I say to some of my very con-
servative friends, conservatism says:
Let’s not have large agglomerations of
power. Let the individual have the
most freedom to exercise his or her
will.
When the President overreaches,
what has happened to the true conserv-
atives? They are quiet. They almost
hide under their desks. History will not
look at it kindly.
Many of my Republican colleagues
have military installations, schools,
and major projects in their States that
would suffer as a result of the Presi-
dent’s emergency. The Pentagon last
week warned of dire outcomes if this
funding is not restored, even warning
that lives might be at risk.
Will Senate Republicans vote to de-
fend our troops, their families, their
children? Will they vote to defend mil-
lions of dollars of important projects in
their States, including medical facili-
ties in North Carolina, a hurricane re-
covery project in Florida, and a middle
school in Kentucky? Well, these ques-
tions will be answered this week.
I have seen reports that the Repub-
licans are searching for other ways to
restore military funding other than by
ending the President’s emergency dec-
laration. Make no mistake—Democrats
will not assent to backfilling accounts
or other backhanded ways of approving
taxpayer dollars for the President’s
border wall. The President said Mexico
would pay for it. That is the only thing
he said during the campaign. When
people yelled ‘‘build the wall,’’ it was
Mexico that was going to pay for it,
not American taxpayers and certainly
not our military—not the brave men
and women who risk their lives for us
and whose families go through such
hardship.
The simplest, quickest, and only way
of protecting military funding is for
my Republican friends to join us in ter-
minating the emergency declaration
later this week.
I urge—urge—my Republican col-
leagues to think about their States and
the important military projects that
hang in the balance, to think about the
precedent it would set for this Presi-
dent and for future Presidents, and
above all, to think about the constitu-
tional questions, to just read the Con-
stitution and defend the Article I pow-
ers of Congress given to us by the
Founders.
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY
LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
f
NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, this
week the Senate will consider more of
the President’s choices to fill impor-
tant positions in the Federal Govern-
ment. Too many important seats have
continued to gather dust 2.5 years into
this Presidency due to systematic
Democratic obstruction.
The President deserves his team, and
the American people deserve to be gov-
erned by the government they actually
elected back in 2016. So as long as there
continues to be resistance to proc-
essing uncontroversial nominees in the
typical fashion by voice vote, we will
just continue to vote on these impres-
sive men and women.
Leading off this week are nominees
to be Deputy Under Secretary of the
Treasury, Ambassador to the Republic
of Fiji, Solicitor of the Department of
the Interior, and Deputy Commissioner
of Social Security. I hope our col-
leagues will join in supporting each of
them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5619
September 23, 2019
our important job of funding the Fed-
eral Government.
Last week brought an unfortunate
spectacle: The vast majority of our
Democratic colleagues actually filibus-
tered legislation to fund our national
defense—at a dollar figure they had
previously agreed to—for the sake of a
political fight with the President.
The funding our commanders need to
keep pace with China and Russia, the
funding our men and women in uniform
need for their tools and training, even
a pay raise for our servicemembers—all
of it was blocked by our Democratic
colleagues, blocked by Democrats in
order to pick a partisan fight with the
White House. That is an interesting
statement of priorities, but I remain
hopeful that we can get this process
back on track.
Back in July, both parties in both
Houses of Congress and the White
House all agreed to a bipartisan, bi-
cameral roadmap to guide appropria-
tions. We all agreed to rule out poison
pill policy riders and not to seek
changes in Presidential authorities rel-
ative to current law. So I hope we can
rediscover that roadmap and make
some progress. In the meantime, before
the end of the week, we will vote on a
continuing resolution to prevent a
lapse in funding while the work con-
tinues.
f
SOCIALISM
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on
a related matter, while Senate Repub-
licans continue to seek bipartisan solu-
tions, the story on the other side of the
Capitol has been a little bit different.
Speaker PELOSI and the Democratic
House continue to neglect opportuni-
ties to find compromises that might
actually become law and instead churn
out one leftwing messaging bill after
another.
Two weeks ago, just days before
Iran’s coordinated attack on the
world’s largest oil processing facility
in Saudi Arabia, House Democrats took
it upon themselves to send us several
pieces of legislation that would have
reduced—reduced—American energy
independence.
Domestic energy is a driver of Amer-
ican prosperity and one of the big suc-
cess stories of recent years, but the
House Democrats want us to retreat.
They send us go-nowhere legislation
the Senate will not pass and the Presi-
dent will not sign.
And then, lest a whole week go by
without one of these exercises, here is
what happened last week: House Demo-
crats began unveiling Speaker PELOSI’s
handmade plan to have Washington,
DC, bureaucrats start micromanaging
America’s prescription drugs. It is the
same old one-size-fits-all, government-
controlled philosophy we continue to
see from our Democratic colleagues.
Forget about choice. Forget about
competition. Forget about free enter-
prise and finding ways to unleash more
market forces to help consumers. Just
give Washington bureaucrats more
power to clumsily call the shots and
manipulate markets from the top
down.
Predictably, what this plan amounts
to is not an efficient, effective way to
help American families but an effi-
cient, effective way to bring even more
of the economy under the bureauc-
racy’s thumb and potentially set us on
a track toward nationalizing a major
industry.
There are millions of Americans who
benefit from our Nation’s incredible in-
novations and the R&D breakthroughs
on new drug treatments and cures. We
really ought not to jeopardize that.
American families deserve more
choice, more competition, more afford-
ability. The last thing we need is for
the socialist delusions of the Green
New Deal and Medicare for All to be
copied and pasted into innovations and
cures, putting them at risk.
Fortunately, this Republican Senate
won’t let the Speaker’s dangerous pro-
posal hurt the country. We will stay fo-
cused on the American people’s busi-
ness, and we will keep hoping our
friends across the building put aside
the political performances and join us
to work on real solutions with a real
chance of becoming real laws.
f
UKRAINE
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on
one final matter, the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence has long
worked on a bipartisan basis in secure
settings out of the public spotlight to
conduct critically important oversight
of classified and sensitive matters. So I
have been disappointed to see our col-
league, the Democratic leader, choose
to politicize the committee’s ongoing
efforts with respect to a recent whistle-
blower allegation—the special subject
of which is still unknown.
As my friend Senator SCHUMER is
aware, Chairman BURR and Vice Chair-
man WARNER have been working to-
gether to get the Acting Director of In-
telligence and the intelligence commu-
nity’s inspector general before the
committee this week to discuss the
matter. As with most matters before
the committee, I believe it is ex-
tremely important that their work be
handled in a secure setting with ade-
quate protections, in a bipartisan fash-
ion, and based on facts rather than
leaks to the press.
It is regrettable House Intelligence
Committee Chairman SCHIFF and Sen-
ator SCHUMER have chosen to politicize
the issue, circumventing the estab-
lished procedures and protocols that
exist so the committees can pursue
sensitive matters in the appropriate,
deliberate, bipartisan manner.
Although we don’t know the sub-
stance of the allegations, there is spec-
ulation that it relates to our relation-
ship with Ukraine. For my part, as I
stated earlier this month, I was very
glad to see the White House release se-
curity assistance funds for Ukraine.
I championed U.S. security assist-
ance to Ukraine over the objections of
the Obama administration in 2014 and
have consistently believed in the im-
portance of helping our Ukrainian
partners defend their territory against
Russian aggression. In fact, I had been
personally pressing them to release se-
curity assistance funding for several
months to ensure the United States did
not walk back our important commit-
ments to Ukraine.
On two occasions I raised the need to
keep our commitment to Ukraine with
the Secretary of Defense, expressing
my interest in seeing this money be re-
leased to help our Ukrainian partners.
I raised it with the Secretary of State.
My staff also engaged senior officials
at the Pentagon, at the State Depart-
ment, at the National Security Coun-
cil, and at the Office of Management
and Budget. I also worked closely with
Senator GRAHAM on the State and For-
eign Operations Appropriations Sub-
committee and Chairman SHELBY.
Throughout July, August, and early
September, I worked hard to ensure
that Ukraine received this much-need-
ed assistance. That is because, going
back years, I have urged administra-
tions of both parties to be completely
clear-eyed about the dangerous inten-
tions of Putin’s Russia and the impor-
tance of standing with Ukraine.
I sounded the alarm early and often
when President Obama went soft on
Putin and missed opportunities to send
arms to Ukraine, and during the
Trump administration, I have been a
strong supporter of its efforts to pro-
vide defensive lethal weapons to
Ukraine and to Georgia.
As I have said repeatedly, Russia
poses a significant threat to U.S. inter-
ests. The best way to contest Putin and
his hegemonic aspirations is to rebuild
our defenses, work closely with our al-
lies and partners, and improve the ca-
pacity of those threatened by Moscow
to defend themselves.
I am grateful that security assist-
ance has finally been released to help
our friends in Ukraine defend them-
selves. Now the task falls on us to pass
a Defense bill and make the necessary
investment in modernizing our own
military to ensure America’s pre-
eminent position in the world and to
deter challenge from adversaries like
Russia and China.

UKRAINE
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I just
listened to the majority leader come to
the floor and tell Members of the Sen-
ate that they should close their eyes
and box their ears to the current scan-
dal that is engulfing the White House
and the Trump administration. I heard
the majority leader accuse Democrats
of ‘‘politicizing’’ President Trump’s de-
mand that the Government of Ukraine
interfere in the 2020 election. That is a
laughable charge, and it is not going to
silence us on this matter of grave im-
portance.
First of all, I have no idea what it
means to politicize something these
days. News flash: We are politicians.
We practice politics. That is our job. I
get told very often that I am politi-
cizing gun violence when I suggest that
maybe we should pass laws in order to
change the daily trajectory of violence
in this country. Yet the very reason we
are here is to protect the safety of our
constituents and to protect the sanc-
tity of our democracy.
What we are standing up for right
now is the rule of law, and I hope, over
the course of this week, my Republican
colleagues will join us in that basic re-
sponsibility that Members of the Sen-
ate and House of Representatives have.
We see the rule of law slipping away
from us right now. We see our Nation
being turned into a banana republic
where the President can do anything
he wants and turn the organs of state
into his permanent political machine—
his means of crushing his opponents.
Today we see that many of my Repub-
lican colleagues are not just letting it
happen but facilitating it.
There has to be a line that the Presi-
dent cannot cross. There has to be a
moment when we all stand up and say:
This has gone too far.
The President has admitted this
weekend to asking a foreign leader to
open an investigation into one of his
political opponents as a means of ad-
vancing himself politically. That is not
allowed in a democracy. That fun-
damentally corrupts the foreign policy
of our Nation. It makes us all less safe
when foreign governments now wonder
whether they are going to be enlisted
into the political operation of the
President of the United States. This
has always been a no-go area for Demo-
cratic and Republican administrations
because we understand the vast power
the Presidency has. If the President
chooses to use that power and the le-
verage he has over people in this coun-
try and in other countries to do his po-
litical bidding, then there is nothing to
protect any of us from the executive
branch.
The idea that the President can open-
ly admit that he is asking a foreign
government to get involved in his po-
litical reelection campaign—and be-
lieve that he will get away with it—
suggests a belief in the impunity sur-
rounding his office. We should all be
concerned about that.
At the very least, if my Republican
colleagues don’t share my grave alarm
at the disclosures of the last 48 hours,
then we should at least agree that the
whistleblower complaint needs to come
before the Congress unredacted. There
is no fuzzy penumbra around this law.
It is clear as day. If a whistleblower
makes a complaint that is deemed ur-
gent in nature, it must be presented to
the Congress. The President cannot
hold it back; the executive branch can-
not make it a secret.
What makes it worse is that the
President seems to be playing a game
with this whistleblower complaint. He
seems to be teasing out little bits of in-
formation that are contained in it here
and there in order to play to his polit-
ical advantage. It is even worse than
holding back the complaint from us. He
is now using pieces of it to try to gain
advantage over his political opponents.
At the very least, over the next 24
hours, we need to come to a conclusion
that the law needs to be followed. If
the President can withhold from us
whistleblower complaints that are not
flattering to him—that potentially im-
plicate him—then what is the point of
having a whistleblower law? What is
the point of having a process to protect
people who are uncovering corruption
in the administration if the adminis-
tration can keep those complaints se-
cret?
Let’s just be honest. If this President
gets away with it, the next Democratic
President can get away with it, and the
next Republican President can get
away with it. We will have lost all of
our power to see into the wrongdoing
of an administration. There will be a
day when Republicans want to see into
potential wrongdoing of an administra-
tion of the opposite party, but that will
be all gone if we don’t, at the very
least, come to the conclusion that we
need to see it as the law states.
That is just the beginning because I
think—as the President has adver-
tised—that complaint is going to show
he did, indeed, try to pressure a foreign
government to conduct investigations
into one of his political opponents. I
think this is a really serious moment
for the country. I think it is a really
serious moment for the prerogatives of
the article I branch.
I understand that my Republican col-
leagues may not be ready to talk about
consequences for the administration
for their wrongdoing, but, at the very
least, we need to come together and
make sure we have all of the informa-
tion necessary.
By the way, it doesn’t end with the
whistleblower complaint because the
whistleblower complaint is likely
going to raise even more questions that
we are going to have to answer. We
have a duty to then go out and find ad-
ditional information.
For many, the President’s admission
of guilt may be enough to make a de-
termination about what the next steps
are. But for those who aren’t persuaded
that there have to be consequences for
the President’s admission of corrup-
tion, then we should use the organs at
our disposal to try to figure out the
rest of the details surrounding this in-
cident or series of incidents. What
kinds of contacts have the President’s
representatives been having with the
Ukrainian Government? Has the State
Department been involved in trying to
do the President’s political bidding in
and around Ukraine? How many people
in the administration knew about this?
Who tried to stop it? Who has been in-
volved in keeping the whistleblower
complaint from us? There are so many
questions that need to be answered
here, and it should be our responsi-
bility to get to the bottom of all of
them.
I think this is a really serious mo-
ment for this country. I think the
minute the President is able to turn
the foreign policy of this Nation into a
vehicle for his own political advance-
ment is the day that democracy, as we
know it, slips away from us. If we
aren’t ready to have a bipartisan con-

some bipartisan consensus in the way
that this place used to have all the

the information necessary to move for-
ward.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak for up to
15 minutes.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, we
have heard some deeply disturbing rev-
elations in recent days about President
Trump’s efforts to tie congressionally
appropriated security funding for
Ukraine hostage to its government’s
willingness to investigate his political
opponents here at home. The alleged
threat by President Trump to withhold
vital security funding from Ukraine
came out last week in press reports
about a whistleblower complaint from
a U.S. intelligence official. These rev-
elations suggest a gross abuse of power
unlike anything I have ever seen dur-
ing my 27 years of working on U.S. for-
eign policy. They also show Donald
Trump once again welcoming a foreign
power to influence our elections, this
time using the power of the White
House.
As of today, the Acting Director of
National Intelligence has refused to
comply with the law that requires him
to share this whistleblower complaint
with Congress. Yet that hasn’t stopped
multiple members of the President’s
inner circle from all but confirming
that the President pushed Ukrainian
President Zelensky to open an inves-
tigation into former Vice President Joe
Biden. They have, together, engaged in
a disturbing effort to convince the
American people that this sort of be-
havior is somehow normal.
We first watched the President’s per-
sonal lawyer admit on CNN that he had
raised this issue of investigating Biden
on the President’s behalf. Then, yester-
day, we saw Secretary Pompeo sink to
a new low when he defended this behav-
ior on national TV. Then it was the
President himself who admitted it to
reporters—the President himself. I am
not sure what more evidence we need,
folks.
Where are my Republican colleagues?
Where are those supposed defenders of
democracy and freedom? Where are the
advocates for a strong relationship
with Ukraine? They are silent, shame-
fully silent.
For more than 2 months, the Presi-
dent held up $391 million in urgently
needed security assistance for
Ukraine—assistance that was appro-
priated by the Senate with broad bipar-
tisan support. Congress didn’t pass this
funding so that the President could sit
on it. We didn’t pass this funding so
that the President could use it as le-
verage to get Ukraine to investigate
his political opponents. We passed this
funding because Ukraine needs our sup-
port against relentless Russian aggres-
sion and because providing that sup-
port is in the interest of our own na-
tional security goals.
Many of us were certainly not sur-
prised to see this administration delay
assistance to Ukraine given the Presi-
dent’s repeated cowering to Moscow on
the international stage. Yet, for 2
months, we wondered exactly why this
money was being held from Ukraine.
Now we know. The President withheld
this money all in the hopes that the
Ukrainian Government would open a
bogus investigation into Vice President
Biden’s son. How is that not an abuse
of power?
I welcome efforts in the House to
fully investigate the role of the Presi-
dent’s personal lawyer in pressuring a
foreign country to investigate the fam-
ily of a potential political opponent. I
urge the Senate to follow suit because
a legitimate President would never
allow his lawyer to override bipartisan
support for Ukraine. A legitimate
President would not let his personal
lawyer compel foreign powers to inter-
fere in our political process. A legiti-
mate President would not withhold
congressionally appropriated funding
to Ukraine to advance his reelection
prospects. So I am calling for a series
of measures today to get to the bottom
of this.
First, I call upon the inspector gen-
eral of the State Department to review
the withholding of security assistance
for Ukraine. This review must include
the extent to which the Department
was aware of or was part of the deci-
sion to withhold these funds and
whether our foreign assistance laws
were broken. The inspector general
must also examine whether the State
Department knew why the administra-
tion was withholding these funds and
highlight any communications between
the White House and the State Depart-
ment on this matter.
Second, I call upon the State Depart-
ment to provide all details and records
about any support in any form pro-
vided from the Department for the
President’s personal lawyer’s efforts in
Ukraine. We, likewise, need to know
about any briefings the President’s per-
sonal lawyer provided to Department
personnel and his interactions with
Ukrainian officials.
Third, I call on the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget to tell Congress why
it sat on Ukraine’s security assistance
for more than 2 months. It typically
takes the OMB just 5 days to review
notifications from the implementing
agencies. To sit on a notification for
more than 2 months is unorthodox, un-
precedented, and unacceptable.
Fourth, I call upon the Senate Com-
mittees on Foreign Relations, Appro-
priations, Armed Services, and the Se-
lect Committee on Intelligence to im-
mediately hold hearings on the Presi-
dent’s purported use of security assist-
ance to pressure Ukraine to open an in-
vestigation into a political opponent. I
urge Chairman RISCH to fulfill his com-
mitments to hold a hearing on Russia
and a markup on Russia sanctions
soon.
If President Trump had used money
to coerce another person to perform
some corrupt action on his behalf, we
would call it out for what it was—ex-
tortion. Are we just going to let the
President of the United States extort
foreign leaders? Are we going to let
him reshape American foreign policy
to advance his own personal and polit-
ical goals? Is this not a gross abuse of
Presidential power? If not, then what
is? These committees have a responsi-
bility to ask these questions, and they
have a constitutional responsibility to
do their jobs.
The Senate, as a whole, has an obli-
gation to get to the bottom of this. Do
my Republican colleagues really think
it is OK to ask a foreign power to pur-
sue unfounded allegations against a po-
litical opponent? Is this the new nor-
mal? I hope not. This is behavior that
we have never seen from an American
President. Unfortunately, it is behav-
ior that fits into President Trump’s
broader pattern of surrendering to his
patrons in Moscow.
I wish I could say that extorting
Ukraine were the only way Donald
Trump corrupted our national security
over the course of the summer, but
that is just not the case. Last month,
President Trump also redirected fund-
ing for the European Deterrence Initia-
tive to his ridiculous border wall.
Funding for the European Deterrence
Initiative helps our allies counter the
kind of Russian malign influence that
was deployed by Putin against our de-
mocracy in 2016.
It is well known by now that Presi-
dent Trump was lying when he said
that Mexico would pay for the wall. To
this day, he refuses to own up to this
lie, so much so that he is willing to si-
phon dollars away from our military
and abandon our most vital democratic
allies in Europe to pursue a medieval
vanity project. It is yet another exam-
ple of his selling out our national secu-
rity to curry favor with his political
base.
Over the past few weeks, my office
has heard from several European Em-
bassies that are now stuck holding the
bill for Trump’s wall. While you won’t
hear it from them publicly because
they, too, fear a backlash from this
President, they are offended and angry
about this decision. It is simply as-
tounding. We are talking about the al-
lies that Americans fought and died for
in order to defend democracy, worked
so hard to rebuild after World War II,
and continued to protect during the
Cold War.
I am sure the Kremlin couldn’t be
happier. To Putin, this must be a

stroke of genius. Trump is killing two
birds with one stone by redirecting
these funds. He is dividing us from our
European allies in the face of Russian
aggression and dividing the American
people with his politics of hate. I have
said it before, and I will say it again:
Investing in Donald Trump’s candidacy
was the best decision Putin ever made.
His patron at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave-
nue will stop at nothing to repay the
debt. It might indeed be the only debt
businessman Donald Trump has ever
worked so hard to repay.
My friends, we have witnessed a real
summer of love between Trump and
Putin. Consider the G7 meeting in
France last month. So clearly was the
United States not the leading voice at
the table. So tragically have we lost
the confidence of our closest allies, and
so predictably did our President once
again make an appeal on behalf of his
patron in Moscow by repeatedly calling
for the expansion of the G7 to include
Russia.
Sometimes I wonder: Does President
Trump actually think that Russia is a
democracy? Does he think that the
Russian people live in freedom? Does
he see Russia as an advanced economy?
Does he believe Russia shares Amer-
ica’s interests?
I have to say that little surprises me
these days, but even I was taken aback
to see him blame President Obama for
Russia’s behavior—on foreign soil, no
less.
There is only one country responsible
for Russia’s removal from the G8 in
2014, and that is Russia. The Russian
Federation was suspended from the G8
by its fellow countries because of its
invasion and illegal occupation of Cri-
mea, which is the territory of the sov-
ereign nation Ukraine. Five years
later, more than 10,000 Ukrainian patri-
ots are dead. That is why Russia does
not belong in the G8.
What has the Kremlin done since 2014
that could possibly justify an expan-
sion of the G7? Has it suspended its il-
legal occupation? Has it behaved like a
responsible member of the inter-
national community? Has it respected
the sovereignty of other nations? The
answers are no, no, and no.
Let’s review Russia’s behavior since
2014.
First—and on the top of mind for
many of us—was Russia’s sweeping and
systematic interference in our 2016
Presidential election on behalf of then-
Candidate Donald Trump, as is docu-
mented in the special counsel’s sober-
ing report. Spreading propaganda, ma-
nipulating social media, and spying on
American election infrastructure is not
the behavior of a G7 country.
Second was the Kremlin’s chemical
weapons attack on British soil—a bla-
tant assassination attempt against a
Putin opponent and his daughter. One
British citizen was killed, and others
required medical attention. This is not
an isolated case. Just last month, a
Russian citizen was gunned down in a
park in Berlin at the suspected hand of
the Russian authorities.
This is not the behavior of a G7 coun-
try.
Third is the Kremlin’s complicity in
Bashar al-Assad’s war crimes in Syria.
An untold number of Syrian civilians
have been killed by Russian airstrikes
launched in support of Assad. Those re-
sponsible should be tried in The Hague
on war crimes charges. This is not the
behavior of a G7 country.
Fourth, in recent weeks, Russian
forces have ramped up their pressure
on the country of Georgia. More than
11 years after Russia’s invasion, the
Georgian people suffer under its ongo-
ing aggression. That is not the behav-
ior of a G7 country.
Fifth is the recent Russian crack-
down on demonstrators exercising
their basic political rights. Throughout
the summer, Putin oversaw the brutal
beatings of children, women, and men
and subjected everyday Russian citi-
zens to arbitrary arrest and detention.
What was their ask? What was their
plea? That they be able to register
their own local candidates for their
own local elections.
The Kremlin’s ongoing and too often
violent oppression of the Russian peo-
ple is not the behavior of a G7 country.
No country in the G7 acts this way.
This behavior is destabilizing, it is ag-
gressive, it is authoritarian, and it
does not belong at the table of democ-
racies.
It is truly a disgrace that any Amer-
ican President would so easily discount
all of what I have just described to win
favor with his patron and pal.
Of course, these aren’t the only gifts
bestowed by President Trump during
this summer of love.
Let’s not forget how the President
has delayed sanctions on Turkey over
its purchase of the Russian S–400 sys-
tem. Congress passed these sanctions
under the Countering America’s Adver-
saries Through Sanctions Act, or
CAATSA, in response to Russia’s at-
tack on our elections in 2016. We have
these sanctions for a reason. They ad-
vance America’s national security in-
terests. They starve the Russian de-
fense sector of much needed inter-
national business. By not imposing
them, this President is both failing to
hold Russia accountable and sending a
dangerous message to other countries
that they can buy Russian weapon sys-
tems without consequence. From the
moment we passed CAATSA, this ad-
ministration has resisted every step of
the way.
So let’s imagine, for a moment, what
a legitimate American President, a
President who is not a Putin puppet,
would do in this situation. How would
that person protect our country?
First, a legitimate President would
not endanger the relationship with a
key ally in order to gain political ad-
vantage at home. They would show sol-
idarity with our democratic allies by
providing all appropriated security as-
sistance to Ukraine and funding for Eu-
ropean efforts to counter Russian ag-
gression.
Second, I am sure they would not
welcome Russia back into the G7.
Third, they would impose CAATSA
sanctions on Turkey and send a clear
message to the world that the United
States is serious about imposing pres-
sure on the Russian defense industry.
So let me close. The United States of
America must always stand on the side
of democracy, human rights, freedom,
and the rule of law. That is why we
must secure our elections from the
threat of foreign interference at home
and defend democracies in the face of
Russian aggression abroad.
That is why we must demand that se-
curity funding appropriated by Con-
gress is actually delivered and that the
sanctions we craft to counter our ad-
versaries are imposed.
That is why we cannot be silent when
an American President extorts foreign
countries into influencing our elec-
tions or welcomes an authoritarian
strongman’s return to the G7.
I implore my colleagues to use the
powers of Article I of the Constitution.
We have to get to the bottom of these
very issues and preserve the critical
checks and balances we have in our Na-
tion.
I yield the floor.

KEN BURNS’ ‘‘COUNTRY MUSIC’’
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President,
Ken Burns told me last year that his 8-
part, 16-hour ‘‘Country Music’’ film,
which concludes on PBS this week,
could be more popular than his Civil
War film. After watching the first epi-
sodes, I suspect he might be right. His
new film plumbs the depths of the
American soul, using the one tool—
music—that is the most likely to touch
the largest number of us.
As a U.S. Senator from Tennessee, I
will confess my bias. The first 2 hours
of ‘‘Country Music’’ a week ago Sunday
were about the recordings of hillbilly
music in 1927 at the birthplace of coun-
try music in Bristol, where the Ten-
nessee-Virginia State line runs down
the middle of Main Street. Two years
ago, the Senator from Virginia, Mr.
KAINE, and I, played a little concert—I
on the keyboard and he on the har-
monica—at the end of that Main
Street, at a fiddler’s festival that they
had. The rest of the Ken Burns episode
winds through a community called
Boogertown in Eastern Tennessee, in
the Smoky Mountains, where Dolly
Parton was born, to the Grand Ole
Opry in Nashville and to Beale Street
in Memphis.
We like to say that the whole world
sings with Tennessee, but country
music is more than Tennessee music. It
is more than Appalachian music. It is
more than the music of poor white
Americans. It comes from the heart.
As Burns’ and Duncan’s storytelling
reminds us, every one of us has a heart.
There is no better evidence of this than
paying less than $20 to sit at a table at
the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville. There
you listen to three songwriters tell the
stories behind their songs and play
them for a small audience who doesn’t
even whisper during their perform-
ances.
I sat at the Bluebird on a Saturday in
2013, listening to a young songwriter,
Jessi Alexander, sing her song, ‘‘I Drive
Your Truck.’’ One of her cowriters,
Connie Harrington, had heard the story
on NPR. It was the story of Jared
Monti, an American soldier killed in
Afghanistan trying to save another sol-
dier. He won a Congressional Medal of
Honor for that. To remember his son,
his father, Paul, drives Jared’s Dodge
Ram truck because, the father says, ‘‘I
am alone, in the truck, with him.’’
When Jessi Alexander finished singing,
everyone in the Bluebird was weeping.
I said to the person next to me, ‘‘That
has to be the song of the year,’’ and it
was.
Last week, I attended the Annual
Nashville Songwriter Awards show. I
looked through the program listing all
of the previous songs of the year. In
2012, it was Dolly Parton’s farewell
song to Porter Wagoner, ‘‘I Will Al-
ways Love You.’’ Dolly Parton is a
great songwriter too. In 2003, it was
‘‘Three Wooden Crosses.’’ In 1972, it was
‘‘Old Dogs, Children, and Watermelon
Wine,’’ by Tom T. Hall. Then, in 1969, it
was ‘‘Okie from Muskogee,’’ by Merle
Haggard. ‘‘Three chords and the truth’’
is how songwriter Harlan Howard de-
fines country music.
Ken Burns has become America’s sto-
ryteller, a skill much more difficult
than it would seem. He tackles the sub-
jects that divide us, like the Civil War
and Vietnam, and he presents them in
a form that allows us to travel through
those wrenching experiences, gathering
the information we need to form our
own opinions.
One could argue that Ken Burns is
our most effective teacher of U.S. his-
tory, a subject woefully undertaught in
our schools. The lowest scores on high
school Advanced Placement tests are
not in math and science. They are in
American history. So I am glad to
know that there is more of Ken Burns’
work to come.
According to a New Yorker article in
2017, during the next decade Burns
plans to produce films about the Mayo
Clinic, Muhammad Ali, Ernest Heming-
way, the American Revolution, Lyndon
B. Johnson, Barack Obama, Winston
Churchill, the American criminal jus-
tice system, and African-American his-
tory from the Civil War to the Great
Migration.
Producing these films must cost a lot
of money, but, in my view, every penny
that the Public Broadcasting System
and private contributors have spent
has been worth it. If I had the money,
I would ask Burns how much time he
will spend raising funds to pay for
these next films and I would give him
the amount of money that it would
take so that he could spend that time
producing an extra three or four more
films before he hangs it up. Since I
don’t have the money, maybe someone
else will do that.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to be printed in the RECORD an op-
ed that was in the New York Times,
‘‘Country Music Is More Diverse Than
You Think,’’ by Ken Burns and Dayton
Duncan.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
[From the New York Times, Sept. 13, 2019]
COUNTRY MUSIC IS MORE DIVERSE THAN YOU
THINK
COMMON STEREOTYPES OVERLOOK THE ROLES
THAT BLACKS AND WOMEN HAVE PLAYED IN
SHAPING A UNIQUELY AMERICAN GENRE
(By Ken Burns and Dayton Duncan)
This spring the rapper Lil Nas X, who is
black, released ‘‘Old Town Road,’’ a twang-
inflected song that rocketed to the top of the
country music charts—even though Bill-
board temporarily removed it from the list,
saying it wasn’t sufficiently ‘‘country.’’
A few months later, when the Country
Music Association announced that three
women—Dolly Parton, Reba McEntire and
Carrie Underwood—would host its annual
awards show, some people criticized the
choice as political correctness, as if ‘‘real’’
country music was restricted to good old
boys.
Both controversies reflect the stereotypes
that chronically surround country music.
They overlook its diverse roots, its porous
boundaries and the central role that women
and people of color have played in its his-
tory.
Such narrow views would astonish the two
foundational acts of the genre—Jimmie Rod-
gers and the Carter Family—who contrib-
uted to country music’s early commercial
success in the 1920s. They knew firsthand
that what has made American music so
uniquely American has been its constant
mixing of styles and influences.
It all began when the fiddle, which came
from Europe, met the banjo, which came
from Africa—bringing together ballads and
hymns from the British Isles with the synco-
pations and sensibilities of enslaved blacks.
That mix, that ‘‘rub,’’ which occurred prin-
cipally in the South, set off a chain reaction
that has reverberated in our music ever
since.
The earliest country recordings were
known as ‘‘hillbilly’’ music, just as African-
American recordings were categorized as
‘‘race’’ music. The names echoed a prevailing
prejudice that each genre (and its artists and
its fans) was somehow beneath consideration
from society’s upper rungs—and that each
one was unrelated to the other.
In truth, as the two of us learned during
the eight years we spent exploring the music
and its history, they were always inter-
twined. The music constantly crossed the ra-
cial divide that a segregated nation tried to
enforce.

S5624 September 23, 2019
Before his career took off, Rodgers worked
as a water boy in Mississippi for the mostly
black crews laying railroad track. The men
he met, and their music, shaped his own
emerging style—the songs he made popular
as an adult were essentially the blues, to
which he added a distinctive yodel. In 1930,
at the height of his popularity, he recorded
with Louis Armstrong, the protean jazz art-
ist.
When A.P. Carter collected songs for the
Carter Family, he brought along Lesley Rid-
dle, a black slide guitar player, to help him
remember the melodies. Riddle also taught
the Carters a hymn from his church, ‘‘When
the World’s on Fire,’’ which they recorded.
They then used the same melody for another
song, ‘‘Little Darling, Pal of Mine.’’ Years
later Woody Guthrie, a fan of the Carters,
borrowed the melody for his classic ‘‘This
Land Is Your Land.’’ That one song’s journey
encapsulates the real, interconnected story
of American music.
Bill Monroe, the father of bluegrass, was
mentored by an African-American fiddle
player. Hank Williams, the great honky-tonk
singer, credited Tee-Tot Payne, a black
street musician in Alabama, for ‘‘all the
music training I ever had.’’ Bob Wills created
Western swing by adapting jazz’s big-band
sound to fiddles and steel guitars.
In Memphis in the 1950s, when rhythm and
blues and gospel and hillbilly music began
swirling together in the eddies of the Mis-
sissippi, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Johnny
Cash and others pioneered rockabilly, a pre-
cursor to rock ’n’ roll.
The cross-fertilization went in both direc-
tions. Charley Pride—the first postwar black
artist to have a No. 1 country hit, and the
first artist of any color to win the Country
Music Association’s male vocalist award two
years in a row—was discovered in a bar in
Montana, singing Hank Williams’s ‘‘Love-
sick Blues.’’ He had grown up listening to
the ‘‘Grand Ole Opry’’ show on the radio.
When the rhythm and blues star Ray
Charles was given creative control of an
album for the first time, he chose to record
a selection of country songs. ‘‘You take
country music, you take black music,’’
Charles said, and ‘‘you got the same
goddamn thing exactly.’’ The album was a
sales sensation.
‘‘There’s a truth in the music,’’ the jazz
musician and composer Wynton Marsalis
told us, that ‘‘the musicians accepted at a
time when the culture did not accept. And
it’s too bad that we, as a culture, have not
been able to address that truth. The art tells
more of the tale of us coming together.’’
Likewise, the history of country music is
filled with strong and talented women in
ways the common stereotype seems (or
chooses) to overlook. From Patsy Montana
to Patsy Cline, Kitty Wells to Dolly Parton,
Emmylou Harris to Rosanne Cash to Reba
McEntire, women have created some of coun-
try music’s most enduring art.
In 1926, A.P. Carter and his wife, Sara, had
been turned down by a record label on the
theory that a woman singing lead could
never be popular. Instead, the Carters added
Sara’s cousin Maybelle to the group and
went on to make history, centered on Sara’s
remarkable voice and Maybelle’s innovative
guitar playing, ‘‘the Carter scratch,’’ which
has influenced generations of guitarists.
Jimmie Rodgers relied on his sister-in-law,
Elsie McWilliams, as the writer of more than
a third of his songs. (He couldn’t read musi-
cal notations, so she came to his recording
sessions to teach her new compositions to
him in person.)
In 1966, the same year that the National
Organization for Women was founded and the
phrase ‘‘women’s liberation’’ was first used,
Loretta Lynn wrote and recorded ‘‘Don’t
Come Home A Drinkin’ (With Lovin’ on Your
Mind),’’ a statement that dealt with spousal
abuse and alcoholism and a woman’s right to
her own body, with a bluntness no other mu-
sical genre dared make at the time. Her label
later held back her song ‘‘The Pill’’ because
it seemed too controversial; when it was re-
leased, some stations refused to play it—
until her fans made it a Top-5 country hit
and crossed it over to the pop charts.
‘‘If you write the truth and you’re writing
about your life,’’ Ms. Lynn told us, ‘‘it’s
going to be country.’’
At its best, country music has never been
confined to one simple category or conven-
ient stereotype. It sprang from many roots
and then sprouted many new branches
through the 20th century, creating a com-
plicated chorus of American voices joining
together to tell a complicated American
story, one song at a time.
Country deals with the most basic, uni-
versal human emotions and experiences—
love and loss, hardship and dreams, failure
and the hope of redemption—and turns them
into songs. The songwriter Harlan Howard
once defined country music as ‘‘three chords
and the truth.’’ Three chords imply sim-
plicity. But the truth part is always much
more complex. And more profound.
Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana.
HONORING CAPTAIN VINCENT LIBERTO, JR.
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise
today with a heavy heart to honor the
life of Mandeville police officer Captain
Vincent ‘‘Vinnie’’ Liberto, Jr., who was
killed in the line of duty last week.
Captain Liberto will be remembered for
his life of service to the community
and country.
After graduating from Brother Mar-
tin High School in New Orleans, he
joined the U.S. Marine Corps, where he
ultimately served 10 years as sergeant.
Captain Liberto had a combined 30
years of law enforcement service, 5
with the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s De-
partment and 25 years with the
Mandeville Police Department, where
he was recognized as officer of the
year.
The captain had a brilliant mind for
law enforcement. He graduated from
the FBI National Academy and ran the
Mandeville Police Department’s Crimi-
nal Investigations Division, where he
worked as a polygraphist and was re-
sponsible for the Department’s enforce-
ment functions.
Those who knew him best describe
him as a gentle giant, polite, upbeat,
reasonable, and fairminded—all quali-
ties that make a great police officer.
In his yard flies the Marine Corps
flag, and mounted on the front door are
twin wreaths, one for the marines and
one for the police.
Captain Liberto is survived by his
wife, Tracey, and seven children. He
was 58 years old.
His passion for service was so strong
that he inspired several of his children
to follow in their dad’s footsteps by en-
tering the military and law enforce-
ment. That is the definition of setting
a great example for children.
Captain Liberto’s death is a painful
reminder that our law enforcement of-
ficers put their lives on the line to
keep our community safe. He died dur-
ing a gunfire exchange when a routine
traffic stop turned into a tragedy. The
other officer, Ben Cato, was also in-
jured but thankfully has returned to
work.
Like Captain Liberto and Officer
Cato, our law enforcement officers re-
port to work every day knowing that
they might not come home at night.
They do it for us all, and for that we
should always be grateful.
I ask those who are listening to say a
prayer for Tracey, their kids, and the
officers of the Mandeville Police De-
partment, and for their entire commu-
nity that is grieving the loss of one of
their own.
Vincent Liberto made Louisiana a
better place and our country a better
place, and he will be sorely missed.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
CHINA
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I don’t
know of any topic that is more impor-
tant for our country than the relation-
ship between the United States and
China.
I am a big fan of history. I love to
read about history. I think one of the
best ways to understand the future is
to understand the past. It strikes me
that, at some point in the future,
someone will write a book about the
21st century, and I think that book will
have mention of a number of the things
that consumed our time in political de-
bate. I believe the central issue glob-
ally that will define the 21st century is
the relationship between the United
States and China, in which direction it
heads.
Let me say at the outset that China
is destined to be what it already is be-
coming: a rich, important, and power-
ful nation. That in and of itself should
not be threatening. It is a reality. It is
one that I think holds promise, to the
extent that a rich and powerful China
is a responsible stakeholder in the af-
fairs of the world.
I think there is another truth, and
that is, what is developing today is an
incredibly serious imbalance between
the United States and China on trade
and commerce, increasingly on diplo-
macy, and potentially—eventually—
militarily and geopolitical.
So when I come today to speak about
China, it is not simply in the context
of our current trade tensions, which is
a part of a much broader issue. The
fact of the matter is that this is the
way we should view it because this is
the way the Communist Party of China
views it. The truth is that they view
our trade tensions as an inevitable blip
in their long-term plan to supplant the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5625
September 23, 2019
United States of America as the
world’s dominant political, military,
and economic power.
Now, it is understandable why many
Americans would feel uneasy at the
prospect of being supplanted by China.
First of all, they have seen so many of
our industries that once thrived in our
towns and cities weakened or leave al-
together, and they have read about the
grotesque violation of human rights
and dignity of people and China’s Com-
munist Party’s persecution of Chris-
tians, Muslims, and other religious mi-
norities.
The sad fact is that we have come to
this realization far too late in this
city. For many years, many of the pol-
icy elites across the political spectrum
turned a blind eye to this growing
threat. There was this notion that,
once China became rich and pros-
perous, they would become like us. It is
as if somehow economic prosperity, in
the sense and in the way China is
achieving it, automatically leads to
supporting values such as the ones that
we hold dear. But the fact is that we
can no longer ignore the reality that
this is not the direction that China is
headed, and it has implications for our
country and the world.
Our country, our workers, and fami-
lies can no longer afford elected offi-
cials in this city who turn a blind eye
to the seriousness of this challenge. At
this point, given all the information
before us and the trends that have
clearly emerged, ignorance on this
matter is no longer an excuse, and,
frankly, the Communist Party of China
is no longer hiding its ambition about
what this is all about.
I am not asking you to believe my
words on this. I just ask that you be-
lieve them, that you take their words
seriously. That is why I come here to
point to a speech last week by Huang
Qifan, who is a former Central Com-
mittee member and recently retired as
the vice chair of the National People’s
Congress Financial and Economic Af-
fairs Committee. He showed us, by the
way, what passes as modernization
within the Chinese Communist Party.
In the speech he gave, he didn’t speak
in the typical Communist jargon. He
doesn’t invoke abstract theories or
laws of history or in any way hold
back. He speaks with a frankness that
we should actually be grateful for be-
cause it enlightens us and hopefully
propels us to take action. To Huang, as
he makes very clear, the trade war
that is ongoing is a fight to the death,
an inevitable outcome in a fight be-
tween two systems.
Paraphrasing Mao Zedong, he urged
Chinese businesspeople to shed their il-
lusions and prepare for struggle. China
is the rising power. The United States
is the aging hegemon, and China’s rise
will be sustained.
Huang declared, ‘‘At this time, the
socialist road with Chinese character-
istics is obviously more competitive.
. . . than the U.S. economic system.’’
Such confident words are not just his;
they emanate from the very top. Just
after gaining power, their current
President, apparently for life, Xi
Jinping, told the party it is ‘‘inevitable
that the superiority of our socialist
system will be increasingly apparent.’’
The United States, according to
Huang in his speech, cannot make part-
ners and cannot make space for others
in the world. Rather, we are stuck. We
are stuck in a situation in which China
must fight the United States either
economically or militarily to find its
place in the world.
Throughout his speech, by the way,
he points to various events in the U.S.
and the Western world that is evidence
of the claims that he makes. He points
to the financial crisis, to the bal-
looning deficits, and to what he terms
political instability. In very clear lan-
guage, he says that these are problems
that ‘‘capitalism can’t avoid’’—that is
his quote—but the Chinese system can
through central guidance. ‘‘This is our
institutional advantage,’’ he argues.
Embedded in his speech, there are
two themes. The first is a confidence in
the inevitability of China’s rise and its
conflict with the United States. Close-
ly related to it is a second theme, and
that is an appeal to the rest of the
world to follow in the Chinese authori-
tarian model, or, as they call it, social-
ism with Chinese characteristics. In
their telling, it is clearly a superior
model to ours.
The time has come for America and
our allies, who value freedom and lib-
erty and free enterprise, democracy,
human rights, and the dignity of all
people—the time has come for us to ea-
gerly confront this assertion. Unfortu-
nately, there are too many in the West-
ern world and in the free world that
refuse to see the challenges, indeed, the
threat that is posed by the Communist
Party and China’s vision of the world
in the future.
Rather than discuss the technical
threat posed by an entity like Huawei,
I want to articulate the threat in Chi-
na’s Communist Party’s words, the
threat in their own words, as Qifan said
last week: ‘‘Our currency will become
the world currency.’’
Understand the implications of this
stated goal. China’s aim is to use eco-
nomic power to displace the United
States of America and the role it has
played in the world since the end of the
Second World War. China’s message to
the world is that its industries, its
workers, and its politics will be more
productive than ours. The Chinese
Communist Party says to foreign coun-
tries, to investors, and to businesses
that the long-term play to keep their
economies growing is by partnering
with them, not partnering with us.
Some may say, What is the big deal
about that? Let’s just take care of our
own problems. Here is the big deal.
Here is what it would mean for Ameri-
cans in real terms. If the world heads
in the direction they advocate, it
would mean lower wages for you, it
would mean homes and mortgages that
are unaffordable, and it would mean a
world where what you can say and do
abroad but also at home is increasingly
dictated by the Chinese Communist
Party and its benefactors in the United
States and elsewhere.
If you don’t believe me, just realize
that already major motion pictures
produced in Hollywood are censored—
censored, even as they are played in
the United States because those movies
will not have access to Chinese movie
theaters. We have already seen mul-
tiple American companies have to
apologize, take content off the inter-
net, and change T-shirts that they sell
at stores because they offend the Com-
munist Party of China and are going to
be cut off from selling to that market.
It is already happening. It will happen
at a much more accelerated pace.
By the way, we have also seen news
outlets in some places have to cut back
and censor what they say. We have had
a television program in a major Amer-
ican network take out content from a
program for fear of being censored in
the vast Chinese market. Beyond that,
the new companies, the new tech-
nologies, the improved standards of liv-
ing, which the United States has al-
ways relied on to prove the superiority
of our way of life, will also no longer
exist.
Indeed, some of these predictions are
already happening. The economic
growth, the prosperity, and the sta-
bility that marks Americans’ shared
memory of the last century appear to
be increasingly absent from this one.
Simply put, the Chinese Communist
Party believes that the 20th century,
which was termed the American Cen-
tury, was an anomaly, and they believe
that they alone have mastered the sci-
entific laws of history, so democracy
must stand aside and give way.
We should clearly understand that
the Communist Party of China’s mis-
sion, a mission they term ‘‘national re-
juvenation’’ of Chinese power and Chi-
na’s prominent place on the world
stage, means supplanting our values
and our way of life. As Xi Jinping ex-
plained 2 years ago, this goal is the
original aspiration and mission of the
party.
What is our model? Well, it is incum-
bent upon us as Americans and as lead-
ers and our democratic allies around
the world to make the case that our
model is the superior. It is incumbent
upon us to make the case on behalf of
our model just as aggressively as an
authoritarian China is making their
case for socialism with Chinese charac-
teristics. Our leadership must also be
one that respects human dignity, that
defends our interests and religious lib-
erty, democracy and human rights, and
the rule of law, which means consist-
ently sticking up for nations com-
mitted to these same ideals and stand-
ing with people who are fighting for
these and being crushed by totali-
tarianism anywhere in the world.
By the way, in the 20th century and
the 21st century, American leadership

brought peace. After the carnage of the
first half of the last century, the
United States has led the world to
avoid open great power conflict, and it
meant historically little bloodshed and
deep international stability compared
to previous eras.
The international system that Amer-
ica helped craft and lead comes with a
promise of multilateral security, and
that is why we must remain wholly
committed to protecting our allies. We
spared no cost to help them rebuild to
defend themselves and to protect the
dignity of their citizens. The Chinese
Communist Party, on the other hand,
cannot conceive of a world that is not
driven by status and hierarchy. They
are not partners, and they view no one
as partners. They view them as vassal
states. So this progress, even to some-
one like Huang Qifan, is a hidden plot
to suppress others.
Such cynicism, by the way, reveals
more about the Chinese Communist
Party than it does about us or the fail-
ure of American efforts to offer a help-
ing hand to China in exchange for mod-
ernization. To the Chinese Communist
Party, power serves no purpose but to
strengthen the party’s rule and to
spread its influence around the world.
And for them, those who deviate
from the party’s expectations deserve
to be sent to forced labor camps where
they toil on the party’s behalf and
where mass surveillance is a necessary
safeguard against deviants whose only
crime is to want a private civic life.
As part of making the case for our
model, we must continue to make the
case as to why China is an
untrustworthy partner in any endeav-
or, whether it is a nation-state project,
in an industrial capacity, or financial
integration. They have a neocolonial
project, the Belt and Road Initiative,
which follows a very consistent play-
book: Approach nations with promises
of lucrative state projects, exploit cor-
ruption, bleed those nations dry, and
then hijack their domestic infrastruc-
ture. In Sri Lanka, what it meant was
the de facto takeover of wide swathes
of their political system after a project
sputtered and Beijing seized the port.
Beijing is ultimately an
untrustworthy partner in international
commitments. We have seen this re-
peatedly in the Asia-Pacific where they
have flagrantly violated international
agreements and obligations in Hong
Kong and Taiwan. We see it right off
the coast of Vietnam and the Phil-
ippines, where Beijing is literally
building artificial islands to substan-
tiate ludicrous territorial claims.
Chinese leaders have long claimed to
never seek hegemony, and yet the bul-
lying of their neighbors, they justify it,
and they justify it on the grounds that
China deserves respect because of its
power and position. Doing business in
China is not just like here or anywhere
else. It is not business between two pri-
vate companies. It means doing busi-
ness with companies backed by, spon-
sored by, and protected by the Chinese
Communist Party.
Their economy is purposely opaque,
and Chinese companies, many of which
are state-owned or state-directed, are
tools used by the Chinese Communist
Party to further their mercantilist
goals.
The telecommunications company
that we have heard of so often, Huawei,
is just one example. Nations that have
naively partnered with Huawei on 5G
have exposed vital technological infra-
structure to Beijing’s surveillance
state, a partnership that Beijing has
shown it will readily exploit.
The bottom line is that China, no
matter what, will continue to play a
prominent role in the future of our
world; and frankly, we should welcome
a growing, thriving China, but one that
plays by the rules.
Today’s China, governed by the Chi-
nese Communist Party, is not playing
by any rules. It is a predatory state in
nature, and it actively seeks to sup-
plant not just the United States but a
world order committed to democracy,
human rights, and the dignity of all.
Since their induction into the World
Trade Organization in 2001, China has
shown itself to be anything but a re-
sponsible global partner. This is a dan-
gerous recipe for conflict, and that is
what China’s leaders are preparing for.
Xi put the party on notice in 2013, say-
ing that China ‘‘must diligently pre-
pare for a long period of cooperation
and of conflict’’ with capitalist democ-
racies.
If anything, the intervening years
have strengthened this conviction.
Huang told business leaders that Amer-
icans ‘‘want your life.’’ He calls it an
illusion that ‘‘some small amount of
money’’ would resolve the trade war.
‘‘We do not want to fight but are not
afraid to fight,’’ Huang concluded, once
again quoting Mao.
China clearly sees this moment—
these decades, really—as their oppor-
tunity to supplant America from its
global leadership role. Conflict, armed
or otherwise, is an inevitable byprod-
uct of that progression.
America, as Huang noted, has been
the ‘‘world’s leader for decades,’’ and
we have used that power to build an
international system that prioritizes
fundamental human rights, open demo-
cratic governance, and liberal econo-
mies, all the things that the Com-
munist Party of China believes rep-
resents weakness.
So we must be absolutely clear as to
what that means. If China becomes the
world’s dominant economic power,
they will become the world’s dominant
military power; they will become the
world’s dominant financial power; and
they will become the world’s dominant
cultural power. Given their critique—
and I would say disdain—of our system,
we can expect that a future such as
that will look much different than the
reality we live in now.
If China supplants America in the
West, the world that our children will
inherit will be nothing like the one we
grew up in and know. Instead of ex-
ploiting China’s brand of
authoritarianism country by country,
as they do now, China will be posi-
tioned to reorient the entire globe, the
application of the party’s governance
at home applied on a global scale to
the way countries interact with one
another.
Let me close with the prophetic
words of a Chinese dissident, Wei
Jingsheng. In his testimony before
Congress in the year 2000, against and
in opposition to China’s ascension to
the WTO, he said:
If the United States will not fight the
world’s largest tyranny politically, then in-
evitably it will have to fight it economi-
cally, and eventually, militarily. Therefore,
the only way to preserve peace and freedom
begins by comprehending democracy’s great-
est enemy, and countering it effectively.
Blissful ignorance is no longer an op-
tion. We cannot overlook the obvious
signs in favor of near-term economic
gains. The world has reached a cross-
roads, one in which our inability to act
will usher in a Chinese century, and
that will have disastrous consequences.

September 23, 2019
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
60TH ANNIVERSARY OF MOTOWN
∑ Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, today I
wish to recognize the 60th anniversary
of Motown and remarkable life of Berry
Gordy, Jr., a man who achieved one of
the most significant musical accom-
plishments of the 20th century.
Motown is the sound that changed
America; it broke barriers between
people and united fans of every race
and creed.
Mr. Gordy was born in 1929 to a mid-
dle-class family on the east side of De-
troit. At first, Mr. Gordy pursued his
dreams to become a professional boxer
and boxed until 1950 when he was draft-
ed to serve his country in the Korean
war. After returning from Korea in
1953, Mr. Gordy began to pursue his
passion for music by opening a record
store, and then went on to work at the
Ford Lincoln-Mercury Plant.
In 1959, Gordy founded Tamla
Records that would go on to become
Motown after he received an $800 loan
and moved to 2648 W. Grand Blvd, also
known as Hitsville U.S.A. Due to De-
troit being known as the Motor City,
Mr. Gordy, in tribute to what he felt
was a city of warm, soulful people and
Detroit being his hometown, decided
the perfect name for his company and
new label would be ‘‘Motown.’’
Smokey Robinson and Berry Gordy
formed an early partnership and co-
wrote Motown Records’ first smash-hit
‘‘Shop Around,’’ recorded by The Mir-
acles, who would go on to be Motown’s
first million-record selling record.
Soon, other acts would follow, includ-
ing legendary artists such as the
Supremes, the Four Tops, Marvin
Gaye, Stevie Wonder, and the Tempta-
tions, all discovered by Mr. Gordy.
In the 1960s alone, Motown Records
had over 75 records in the top 10 of the
Billboard Hot 100. In the 1970s, Motown
moved to California and continued to
create hits with a Detroit sound by
groups such as the Jackson 5 and the
Commodores. With so many music leg-
ends, Motown has often been consid-
ered one of the greatest labels of all
time.
In 1998, Mr. Gordy was inducted into
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as
founder and helmsman of the Motown
music empire.
In addition to music, Mr. Gordy pro-
duced films such as the Oscar-nomi-
nated, ‘‘Lady Day Sings the Blues’’ and
‘‘Mahogany.’’ both starring Motown
icon Diana Ross. In 2013, Mr. Gordy
went on to write and produce ‘‘Motown:
the Musical,’’ to tell his story and the
story of Motown Records. ‘‘Motown:
the Musical’’ went on to play 738
Broadway performances, and have mas-
sively successful national tours and
international productions.
Mr. Gordy founded an American
music institution that exemplifies the
unity that must exist in our country
and created a sound that still moves
the Motor City today. Motown’s music
has become a genre all its own and has
grown to be beloved all over the world.
Motown music helped break barriers,
and it is my hope that the legacy of
Barry Gordy, Jr., and Motown will in-
spire the next generation of leaders to
follow their passion and change the
world.∑

RECOGNIZING MELAO BAKERY
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as chair-
man of the Senate Committee on Small
Business and Entrepreneurship, each
week I highlight a small business that
displays the unique entrepreneurial
spirit found throughout our country. It
is my privilege to recognize a Florida
small business that demonstrates con-
sistent hard work, a commitment to
excellent customer service, and a de-
sire to give back to the Florida com-
munity. Today, it is my honor to name
Melao Bakery as the Senate Small
Business of the Week.
Founded in 2009, Melao Bakery is a
family-owned and operated restaurant
run by Eduardo Colon and Denisse
Torres. Originally from Puerto Rico,
Eduardo and Denisse have created a
place where families can enjoy tradi-
tional Puerto Rican cuisine in Kis-
simmee, FL, a city many Puerto
Ricans call home. Melao has grown
from a small bakery in central Florida
with seven employees into a full-menu
restaurant employing more than 150
people at its two locations in Kis-
simmee and Orlando. Melao Bakery is
known for its commitment to exem-
plary customer service and for pro-
viding an authentic, traditional experi-
ence for its customers.
Eduardo and Denisse arrived in Flor-
ida 17 years ago from Vega Baja, PR. In
Vega Baja, the couple owned a bakery
but made the decision to move to Flor-
ida, with their 1-year-old son, in search
of new opportunities. When Eduardo
and Denisse settled in Kissimmee, they
did not move to open the bakery imme-
diately; Eduardo studied to pass truck
driving exams, and through hard work,
he was able to establish his own heavy
transport company.
Melao Bakery not only provides deli-
cious pastries and cuisine, but it also
serves as a meeting place for local His-
panics. They have since expanded their
vision through the acquisition of the
shopping center where Melao Bakery is
located. Eduardo and Denisse’s busi-
ness has been honored for maintaining
a strong sense of Hispanic heritage by
the grassroots organization, the Libre
Initiative. In 2012, Melao Bakery was
also recognized by the Kissimmee
Chamber of Commerce as the first His-
panic business to win its annual Small
Business of the Year award. In 2014,
Melao Bakery was presented with the
Governor’s Business Ambassador
Award for its leadership in creating
employment opportunities in central
Florida. Additionally, Melao Bakery
has won awards for the quality of its
food, such as Best Latin Restaurant in
the Osceola community.
Eduardo and Denisse have made sig-
nificant efforts to better the lives of
those in their community, both in
Florida and in Puerto Rico. After Hur-
ricane Irma hit Puerto Rico in 2017,
Eduardo and Denisse donated dozens of
generators to help survivors get their
businesses back up and running. Their
dedication to preserving the culture
and heritage of Puerto Rico in central
Florida has created a loyal customer
base and has made Melao Bakery a
community staple. Melao Bakery is a
shining example of how dignified work
can lead to grassroots engagement and
successful business expansion. As we
celebrate Hispanic Heritage month, I
am proud to highlight Melao Bakery
for their dedication to Florida’s His-
panic community.∑

GOALS AND IDEALS OF RAIL

RELATED ACCIDENTS, FATALI-
TIES, AND INJURIES
Mr. WICKER (for himself, Ms. CANT-
WELL, Mrs. FISCHER, and Ms.
DUCKWORTH) submitted the following
resolution; which was referred to the
Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation:
S. RES. 322
Whereas the first Rail Safety Week was
held from September 24 through September
30, 2017, by the national education safety
nonprofit Operation Lifesaver, the Depart-
ment of Transportation, and other organiza-
tions;
Whereas Rail Safety Week was launched to
raise awareness about the need for increased
education on how to be safe around highway-
rail grade crossings and railroad tracks, and
to highlight efforts to further reduce colli-
sions, injuries, and fatalities;
Whereas highway-rail grade crossing and
trespassing accidents constituted approxi-
mately 96 percent of all rail related fatalities
during 2018;
Whereas since 2005, the number of public
crossings has declined by 8 percent, while the
number of gates at such crossings has in-
creased by 26 percent;
Whereas, in 2018, 51 percent of all grade
crossing collisions and 64 percent of all fatal
grade crossing collisions occurred at gated
crossings;
Whereas, in 2018, there were a total of 841
rail-related fatalities and 8,177 rail-related
injuries in the United States;
Whereas preliminary Federal statistics
show that 2,216 highway-grade crossing
crashes occurred during 2018, resulting in 263
persons killed and another 840 persons in-
jured throughout the United States;
Whereas trespassing incidents on railroad
property resulted in 571 persons killed and
another 479 injured across the Nation in 2018;
Whereas many collisions between trains
and motor vehicles or pedestrians could have
been prevented by increased education, engi-
neering, and enforcement;
Whereas Operation Lifesaver, the foremost
public information and education program
on rail safety, administers a public edu-
cation program about grade-crossing safety
and prevention of trespassing;
Whereas during Rail Safety Week, from
September 22 through 28, 2019, and through-
out the year, everyone is encouraged to ob-
serve added caution as motorists or pedes-
trians approach tracks or trains;
Whereas, the United States and Canada
will observe Rail Safety Week concurrently;
and
Whereas this important observance should
lead to greater safety awareness and a reduc-
tion in highway-rail grade crossing crashes
and pedestrian and railroad incidents: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) supports the designation of Rail Safety
Week;
(2) expresses strong support for—

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5632 September 23, 2019
Whereas the percentage of children who
are in kinship foster care has increased by
almost 10 percent since 2006;
Whereas the number of children placed in
foster care continues to increase due in part
to the opioid crisis and child welfare agen-
cies are increasingly reliant on families who
take in kin;
Whereas while kinship care is the most
common term for relative caregivers of chil-
dren, they are sometimes also referred to as
kincaregivers or grandfamilies;
Whereas kinship caregivers residing in
urban, rural, and suburban households in
every State and territory of the United
States have stepped forward out of love and
loyalty to care for children during times in
which parents are unable to do so;
Whereas kinship caregivers provide safety,
promote well-being, and establish stable
households for vulnerable children;
Whereas kinship care homes offer a refuge
for traumatized children;
Whereas kinship care enables a child to
maintain family relationships and cultural
heritage and remain in the community of the
child;
Whereas the wisdom and compassion of
kinship caregivers is a source of self-reliance
and strength for countless children and for
the entire United States;
Whereas children in kinship care experi-
ence improved placement stability, higher
levels of permanency, and decreased behav-
ioral problems relative to other children in
foster care;
Whereas kinship caregivers face daunting
challenges to keep children from entering
foster care;
Whereas because of parental substance use
disorders and other adverse childhood experi-
ences, children in kinship care frequently
have trauma-related conditions;
Whereas many kinship caregivers give up
their retirement years to assume parenting
duties for children;
Whereas the Senate wishes to honor the
many kinship caregivers who throughout the
history of the United States have provided
loving homes for children;
Whereas the first President of the United
States, George Washington, and his wife
Martha were themselves kinship caregivers,
as were many other great people of the
United States;
Whereas the Senate is proud to recognize
the many kinship care families in which a
child is raised by grandparents, other rel-
atives, and family friends;
Whereas National Kinship Care Month pro-
vides an opportunity to urge people in every
State to join in recognizing and celebrating
kinship caregiving families and the tradition
of families in the United States helping kin;
Whereas in 2018, Congress provided for kin-
ship navigator programs and services in the
Family First Prevention Services Act en-
acted under title VII of division E of the Bi-
partisan Budget Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–
123; 132 Stat. 64) and the Consolidated Appro-
priations Act, 2018 (Public Law 115–141; 132
Stat. 348);
Whereas in 2018, Congress provided for the
formation of the Advisory Council to Sup-
port Grandparents Raising Grandchildren to
examine supports for grandparents and other
kinship caregivers in the Supporting Grand-
parents Raising Grandchildren Act (Public
Law 115–196; 132 Stat. 1511); and
Whereas more remains to be done to sup-
port kinship caregiving and to ensure that
all children have a safe, loving, nurturing,
and permanent family, regardless of age or
special needs: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) designates September 2019 as ‘‘National
Kinship Care Month’’;
(2) encourages Congress, States, local gov-
ernments, and community organizations to
continue to work to improve the lives of vul-
nerable children and families and to support
the communities working together to lift
them up; and
(3) honors the commitment and dedication
of kinship caregivers and the advocates and
allies who work tirelessly to provide assist-
ance and services to kinship caregiving fami-
lies.
