DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO
TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker:
WASHINGTON, DC,

I hereby appoint the Honorable HENRY
CUELLAR to act as Speaker pro tempore on
this day.
NANCY PELOSI,
Speaker of the House of Representatives.

ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 3, 2019, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by
the majority and minority leaders for
morning-hour debate.
The Chair will alternate recognition
between the parties. All time shall be
equally allocated between the parties,
and in no event shall debate continue

AND STILL I RISE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
and still I rise, with my mnemonic
notes.
And still I rise, Mr. Speaker. I rise
because I love my country. And be-
cause I love my country, I do not rise
with any degree of schadenfreude. I
take no pleasure in what this House is
about to do. I am not gleeful.
I rise because I believe that we must
do what Dr. King called to our atten-
tion when he said that, on some issues,
you must do that which is neither safe
nor politic nor popular. You do it be-
cause conscience tells you it is the
right thing to do.
I rise to announce that I believe that
we are about to do the right thing. And
I know that we are doing the right
thing for a multiplicity of reasons, one
of which is you cannot allow the Chief
Executive Officer to send a letter of ab-
solute, intractable defiance indicating
that there will be no level of coopera-
tion with the lawful constitutional
body that is investigating actions—ac-
tions taken by the President.
You cannot allow this kind of recal-
citrance to exist, because, if you do,
there are no guardrails. We cannot
allow a President to move through the
land without guardrails. He has to
know that there are boundaries.
So I rise to say, today, that this
House is moving in a historic direction,
that, when it is written across the
pages of time that this House took the
action that I believe it will take, I
think we will all find that it was the
right thing to do.
I rise also to say this: The Constitu-
tion allows a President to be im-
peached more than once. If we impeach
now or at some time in the near future
for one issue that we dearly should,
then we find later that the President
has other issues that merit impeach-
ment, we can impeach again. There is
no limit on the number of times.
I don’t think you do it needlessly.
Every time I have called it to the at-
tention of this House, there was pur-
pose and reason behind it, and I believe
that we can do it more than once if it
becomes necessary.
I think the Senate ought to act. I
think the Senate ought to convict. But
if the Senate does not convict, it does
not mean that the House is now ham-
strung and cannot move forward again
with impeachment.
So I rise with no degree of
schadenfreude. I rise with love of coun-
try and heart, and I rise understanding
that Dr. King was eminently correct:
There are times when we must do that
which is neither safe nor politic nor
popular. We do it because it is the right
thing to do.
I rise because I believe we are em-
barking upon the right course for this
House and for our history.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.

STEMMING THE TIDE OF OPIOID
OVERDOSES
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, while still more work needs
to be done to confront our Nation’s
challenges with opioids, I am pleased
to report that my home State of North
Carolina is working to stem the tide
and has witnessed a drop in opioid
overdoses.
In my district, Surry County and its
healthcare professionals, first respond-
ers, and addiction counselors deserve
recognition as contributing to the
county witnessing a drop of over 75 per-
cent in opioid-related emergency room
visits within the last year.
This comes as we implement one of
the most significant bills that Congress
passed last year, the comprehensive
SUPPORT for Patients and Commu-
nities Act.
I helped introduce that legislation
with bipartisan colleagues, and I am
glad to report that the bill is achieving
its goal in stemming the tide of addic-
tion by improving prevention and pub-
lic health efforts, enhancing treatment
and recovery programs, and providing
communities more tools in their fight.
Again, Mr. Speaker, more work needs
to be done to confront our Nation’s

A HISTORIC FIGHT FOR FREEDOM
AND AUTONOMY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) for 5
minutes.
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I want
to spend my 5 minutes to tell a story,
a history story from the Virgin Islands.
This month and for the next 6
months in the Virgin Islands, we com-
memorate a historic fight for freedom
and autonomy. On the small, 20-square-
mile island of St. John, one of the ear-
liest and longest lasting slave rebel-
lions began on November 23, 1733. This
rebellion was preceded by
uncomparable conditions that slaves
were living in on the island of St. John
in the Virgin Islands.
Conditions were devastating. The life
expectancy of slaves in the Virgin Is-
lands never went above the age of 30
years old, and this rebellion was caused
by a drought and a plague of insects
that placed 1,000 enslaved people of St.
John at risk of starvation.
This caused an unprecedented
amount of slaves to run away, what we
call on the island ‘‘marooning,’’ living
in the bush. This led to the vicious and
inhumane Slave Code of 1733. The new
rules threatened amputation, breaking
on the wheel, burning alive, and other
brutal punishment for those who ran
away.
This, then, led to 150 slaves, all of
whom were part of the Akwamu tribe
from Ghana, to begin an uprising. The
Akwamu hoped to turn St. John into
an Akwamu-controlled state.
On the evening of November 23, the
slaves entered the fort on Coral Bay
with cane knives concealed in bundles
of wood. They proceeded to kill all of
the soldiers at the fort. Others across
the island, many who were able to es-
cape, escaped to the island of St.
Thomas, where they took word to the
governor. The governor then, under
pressure, sent troops, sent soldiers to
St. John, who were then also de-
stroyed.
The next 10 weeks saw guerilla-style
warfare between the troops and the
Akwamu rebels. Afraid that the rebel-
lion would spread to the nearby island
of Tortola, the British sent reinforce-
ments. They were quickly dispatched
and quickly rode back to Tortola.
Again, John Maddox, a privateer
from the island of St. Kitts, made a
deal with the Danish officials to aid
the quelling of St. John. He, too, was
not successful.
William Vessup, an owner of a plan-
tation, who was in disrepute with the
Danes, attempted to lure slaves onto a
ship, the organizers of the rebellion,
and told them that they would give
them food and support if they would
come on the ship. They did not fall for
the trickery, and he also was dis-
patched.
It wasn’t until the Spanish Armada
and the French came that this rebel-
lion was able to be quelled in 1734, al-
most 6 months later; and with it, many
were jailed. Some were sent to St.
Croix to work to death, which was
what they decided to give to them, and
many also decided not to go back into
slavery and jumped off of a cliff on the
island to their death—but to freedom.
These 150 Akwamu on the island of
St. John were some of the first African
people in the Americas to have a sense
of freedom, as volatile and short-lived
as it might have been.
It is important to acknowledge, how-
ever, that, for the majority of enslaved
people on the islands of St. John, St.
Thomas, and St. Croix, neither out-
come would lead to freedom. The
enslaved people on the island of St.
John and the rest of the Danish West
Indies would ultimately wait another
114 years for the next rebellion for
their freedom to come.
f
CELEBRATING THE CAREERS OF
THREE CENTRE COUNTY PUBLIC
SERVANTS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, recently, I had the pleas-
ure of traveling back to Pennsylvania’s
15th Congressional District to cele-
brate the careers of three dedicated
public servants in Centre County.
Last month, Centre County Treas-
urer Richard Fornicola and Centre
County Controller Chuck Witmer
served their last day at the Centre
County Courthouse and began their
much-deserved retirements.
Rich Fornicola began his term as
Centre County treasurer in January
2000 and has worked diligently over the
past two decades overseeing every
penny that was received and disbursed
by Centre County, including hunting
permits and fishing licenses, as well as
overseeing bids for county contracts.
Chuck Witmer has spent 15 years in
public service in Centre County, having
worked as the deputy controller for
just under 4 years before being elected
to serve as county controller. Over the
years, Chuck has exhibited fantastic
leadership that includes overseeing the
county ledger, seeing the budget is ad-
hered to, completing the county audit,
and more.
This week, Prothonotary and Clerk
of Courts Debra Immel will be serving
her last day at the courthouse as well.
Debra began her career in Centre Coun-
ty in 1976 as a department clerk and
quickly rose through the ranks of dep-
uty prothonotary and acting prothono-
tary. In 1999, Debra was elected to her
current position and has served in
county government ever since.
Mr. Speaker, together, these individ-
uals have given more than 90 years of
service to Centre County, and they
have worked hard to make Centre
County a better place to live. I would
like to congratulate Rich and Chuck
and Debra on their retirements and
wish them all the best in their new life
chapter.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE
OF COACH JOHN MCKISSICK
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
South Carolina (Mr. CUNNINGHAM) for 5
minutes.
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to honor the life of longtime
Summerville High School football
coach, Hall of Famer, John McKissick,
who passed away on Thanksgiving Day.
Coach McKissick was the greatest
high school football coach our country
has ever seen. In fact, he held the
record for the most wins of any foot-
ball coach anywhere at any single
level. Over the course of his 62-year ca-
reer, he led the Green Wave to 10 State
championships and 621 wins.
Coach McKissick was a mentor and a
father figure to thousands of student
athletes. In total, he coached over 5,000
young men throughout his career.
I had the honor of attending his fu-
neral earlier this week, and I got to
meet several of his former players,
many in their fifties, sixties, seventies,
and even eighties, who all told me
about the incredible impact he had on
their lives.
He famously told his players that it
is not about the Xs and Os; it’s about
the Jims and the Joes. He called his
players his boys. He treated them like
family because they were, and that
feeling was mutual.
It is impossible to imagine high
school football or Summerville without
him, but his amazing legacy will live
on forever.
May God bless his family, his friends,
former players, and the entire Sum-
merville community.
Thank you for everything, Coach.

Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the heroic actions
by members of the Newberry Fire De-
partment.
On March 1, 2019, the alpha shift,
comprised of Captain Andrew Morris,
Lieutenant Brian Beck, Senior Engi-
neer Benjamin Dukes, firefighter Rich-
ard Doran, and volunteer firefighter

completely unresponsive. The fire-
fighters immediately performed CPR
on the victim and as a result of these
actions, the person gained a pulse and
began breathing. The brave actions of
these dedicated public servants re-
sulted in a life being saved, and in the
words of the late Prime Minister of
Great Britain Winston Churchill, who
said the following: There are times
when doing one’s best is not good
enough. One must do what is required.
The brave firefighters of Newberry
Fire Department’s alpha shift did what
was required, and as a result, a life was
saved.
f
CONGRATULATING SARI FELDMAN
ON HER RETIREMENT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Ohio (Ms. FUDGE) for 5 minutes.
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, today I
rise to recognize and congratulate Sari
Feldman on her recent retirement as
the executive director of the Cuyahoga
County Public Library.
Ms. Feldman began her tenure at the
Cleveland Public Library in 1997 as
head of community services, later serv-
ing as deputy director. In 2003, Ms.
Feldman was named the executive di-
rector of the Cuyahoga County Public
Library where she oversaw one of the
country’s busiest public libraries for 16
years.
Ms. Feldman’s leadership was instru-
mental to strengthening the libraries
across Cuyahoga County and ensuring
they were prepared to engage and serve
the community in the 21st century.
Throughout her time as executive di-
rector, she directed an expansive $110
million capital improvement program
for the county’s libraries and navigated
the library system through significant
cuts in State funding without reducing
hours or service.
From 2015 to 2016, Ms. Feldman also
served as the president of the American
Library Association, a testament to
her importance not only to northeast
Ohio but to the entire Nation.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Feldman
for her enduring leadership, service,
and dedication to engaging and empow-
ering the Cuyahoga County commu-
nity.
I congratulate her successor, Tracy
Strobel, the new executive director for
the Cuyahoga County Public Library.
As a northeast Ohio native with dec-
ades of experience, I trust Tracy will
continue to advance Cuyahoga County
Public Library’s mission of being at
the center of community life where
reading, lifelong learning, and civic en-
gagement thrive.
f
AMERICANS SHOULD RENEW IN
THEIR HEARTS OUR NATION’S
MOTTO
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. CONAWAY) for 5 minutes.
Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, our Na-
tion’s motto of ‘‘In God We Trust’’ is
inscribed on the wall above our heads.
The word ‘‘trust’’ is typically defined
as to have confidence, faith, or hope in
someone or something. In this case, it
is obviously trust in God.
To have confidence or faith or hope
in God requires that we know some-
thing about God. This knowledge is
gained by reading and studying the in-
spired word of God, which is, of course
the Bible. God has revealed Himself to
us in the pages of the Bible, and to
trust in God means that we also trust
His teachings as revealed in the Bible.
Among those teachings is a prescrip-
tion for the way we should lead our
lives, the way we should treat each
other, and how we should rely on God
and His teachings to, in fact, trust in
Him.
John Adams wrote that only a moral
and religious people can self-govern. In
my opinion, the morals to which he is
referring to are laid out in God’s teach-
ings in both the Old Testament and the
New Testament of the Bible.
Almost every day we hear someone
ask for God’s blessings on our Nation.
The next time you hear someone ask
for God to bless our Nation, please ask
yourself what is it about America and
our Nation that we are asking God to
bless? Just what is there about our Na-
tion that is, in fact, blessable?
Are we asking God to bless the kill-
ing of more than 61 million babies in
the last 46 years? Are we asking God to
bless the rancor and incivility that per-
meates much of our public discourse?
These and other issues cause me to fear
that we are on the verge of being an
unblessable Nation.
The Old Testament is replete with
times when God’s chosen people, the
Nation of Israel, would stray so far
from His teachings that He would sub-
ject them to awful events and terrible
circumstances to cause them to turn
their hearts back to Him. I believe that
we are on that same destructive path.
We must ask ourselves what should
we do to turn our Nation’s heart back
to God? There is no legislative fix for
this problem. The path to a blessable
Nation must start in the heart of each
one of us. To return to the moral high
ground that has allowed our Nation to
prosper under God’s blessings, we must
each have a moral code to live by.
For me that moral code is the Judeo-
Christian code found in God’s Word.
Jesus Christ is my personal savior, and
I try to live his teachings every day.
Some days I am better at it than oth-
ers, but each of us must have a moral
code that is based on truth, not on
whims or feelings. This awakening
must start now.
It can start by claiming God’s prom-
ise to the Nation of Israel that applies
to our Nation, as well. It is found in II
Chronicles 7:14, which says: ‘‘If my peo-
ple, who are called by my name will
humble themselves and pray and seek
my face and turn from their wicked
ways,’’ emphasis on wicked ways,
‘‘then I will hear them from heaven,
and I will forgive their sin, and heal
their land.’’ Each of us individually
and our Nation as a whole has never
needed that promise more than we need
it today.
Mr. Speaker, we should renew in our
hearts every day our Nation’s motto,
‘‘In God We Trust.’’
f
DEMOCRACY IS FACING A
CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE) for 5 min-
utes.
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, more
than 200 years ago, the delegates of the
Constitutional Convention gathered in
Philadelphia to help chart a path for-
ward for the newly independent United
States of America.
After deliberation, the Framers es-
tablished a system of government with
three equal branches, the legislative,
executive, and judiciary, along with a
system of checks and balances to en-
sure no single branch had too much
power. After years of control by a for-
eign power, our Framers understood
the importance of self-governance and
ensuring no monarch could once again
rule over our country.
Now, more than 200 years since the
ratification of our Constitution, our
democracy faces a constitutional crisis
that the Framers never could have
imagined. The office of the President of
the United States, the most powerful
position in the world, yields immense
influence with the expectation to use
that power in a principled manner.
However, that principled approach
has since vanished as self-interest has
consumed the Oval Office. In the pur-
suit of that self-interest, this President
has compromised our national security
by withholding critical military assist-
ance to Ukraine, military assistance
approved by the Congress, the legisla-
tive branch, to provide assistance to
preserve their sovereignty and counter
Russian aggression.
That same system of checks and bal-
ances described in the Constitution
over 200 years ago is now under attack.
The President, as well as the Members
of Congress, take an oath of office
when stepping into this amazing place
of our Republic to be leaders in our
country, to protect, to preserve, and
defend the Constitution of the United
States as long as we hold this office. As
part of that oath, it is my constitu-
tional duty to protect the Constitution
from all threats, even within our own
government.
This June, I announced my support
for the House of Representatives to
begin an impeachment inquiry. In the 6
months since then, with new details re-
vealed weekly and daily, my support
for the House impeachment inquiry has
never been stronger. This President has
jeopardized our national security to af-
fect an election; no one is above the
law, not even the President.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9262 December 5, 2019
voted to approve a comprehensive re-
port outlining actions regarding
Ukraine and the obstruction of justice.
For 2 weeks last month, the American
people heard various witnesses share
their account of the President and the
things that were happening in our gov-
ernment.
As an African American I stand here
today, Mr. Speaker, and I am very sen-
sitive to any action to oppress my
right to vote. My history as an African
American in this country causes me to
be very alert. Furthermore, the report
details a concerted effort by the White
House to defy authorized congressional
subpoenas for documents, a right the
Supreme Court has affirmed Congress
possesses.
During the Constitutional Conven-
tion, it was noted that Madison rose
and asked his colleagues two questions:
‘‘Shall any man be above justice? Shall
that man be above it who can commit
the most extensive injustice?’’
With great power comes great re-
sponsibility. That responsibility has
been ignored, and it has been dem-
onstrated in the office of our President
that his only interest is his self-inter-
est and not that which is the best in-
terest of the American people.
Mr. Speaker, Congress will be tasked
with making a decision that will likely
alter the course of history. However,
taking the evidence into account, this
is not a difficult decision. When history
looks back, I will be one of the Mem-
bers of Congress who kept my oath,
who served and voted to protect, pre-
serve, and defend the Constitution of
the United States.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.

RECOGNIZING DRS. LYNN AND
SAM COFIELD
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Kentucky (Mr. COMER) for 5 minutes.
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in special recognition of my life-
long friends, Drs. Lynn and Sam
Cofield of Trigg County, Kentucky, for
their remarkable careers and out-
standing contributions to their local
community and beyond. This year
marks their retirement, and I want to
congratulate Lynn and Sam for many
decades of success.
Lynn and Sam met while attending
veterinary school at Auburn Univer-
sity. They married in 1984 and bought
the Trigg County Veterinary Clinic lo-
cated in Cadiz, Kentucky. While prac-
ticing veterinary medicine, they also
managed a 160-acre farm they called
Riverview West. They raised a herd of
purebred Charolais cattle and quickly
rose to prominence among the cattle
industry. Producing and exhibiting
Charolais cattle became passions for
Lynn and Sam, who continued to ex-
pand their influence in the agriculture
community.
From 1986 to 1991 Lynn served as
Kentucky Junior Charolais Association
adviser where I was one of her many
students who traveled the livestock
show circuit with the Cofield family.
Lynn was also active in many organi-
zations over the years ranging from 4–
H and FFA to the Kentucky Veterinary
Medical Association.
Sam served on the Farm Bureau
Board of Directors and the Trigg Coun-
ty Health Department Board. Both
Lynn and Sam supplied the Trigg
County community with high-quality,
honest veterinary medicine until 2019.
Their clinic sold in February, and in
October they began a hard-earned and
much-deserved retirement. In the
words of those who know them best,
the Cofields are staples in Trigg Coun-
ty and the surrounding communities.
Countless families can tell stories of
how the Cofields cared for their pets
and livestock from beginning to end.
The Cofields let no obstacle prevent
them from providing top-notch medical
care. Whether in the wee hours of the
morning or in the pouring rain, the Co-
fields were there ready to lend a hand.
Once again, I want to congratulate
Drs. Lynn and Sam Cofield on their no-
table careers and recent retirement. I
thank them both for being exceptional
leaders in the First Congressional Dis-
trict of Kentucky.
HONORING THE WORK OF THE KENTUCKY MAG-
ISTRATES AND COMMISSIONERS ASSOCIATION
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, today I
rise to recognize the work of the Ken-
tucky Magistrates and Commissioners
Association headquartered in Frank-
fort, Kentucky.
On October 30, 2019, the Association
provided over 500 new pairs of shoes to
Monroe County schools. The shoes were
delivered to my hometown and my
former school Tompkinsville Elemen-
tary. I am deeply grateful to the elect-
ed magistrates and commissioners who
made this donation on behalf of the
KMCA. Their actions represent the
best of the Commonwealth and make
me proud to represent one of its six
congressional districts.
I want to particularly thank several
members of the KMCA from the Mon-
roe County Fiscal Court: Magistrates
Jamie Veach, Roger Deckard, Ricky
Bartley, Ricky Graves, and Mark Wil-
liams, in addition to county judge,
Mitchell Page. I also want to thank my
good friend, J.C. Young, executive di-
rector of the Kentucky Magistrates
and Commissioners Association for
spearheading the effort.

might leave the house without ade-
quate footwear, and because of the ac-
tions of the Kentucky Magistrates and

weeks ago.
Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank the
KMCA for choosing Monroe County and
for the time and energy they sacrificed
to improve the everyday lives of dozens
of schoolchildren. Their efforts are ap-
plauded in Kentucky’s First Congres-
sional District.

Award from the U.S. Department of
Labor.
This marks the second year in a row
that Analytical Engineering, Inc., has
earned this esteemed award. They were
1 of only 12 companies in Indiana to
win this award by hiring and retaining
veterans.
As a Beirut veteran myself, I appre-
ciate companies like Analytical Engi-
neering for taking care of those who
have served our country.
SEND NDAA TO PRESIDENT
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to urge my Democratic colleagues to
stop playing political games and send
the NDAA to President Trump’s desk.
The NDAA has been a bipartisan
piece of legislation that we, as Con-
gress, have passed for 58 straight years.
The NDAA is essential for our men and
women in uniform and for our National
Defense Strategy.
Now, in the final hour, House Demo-
crats want to wedge partisan policies
into this bill. As Democrats continue
to divide Congress over nondefense
issues, they play right into the hands
of our enemies.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to
stop indulging in this political theater
and pass the NDAA.

WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker,
climate change is an immediate and
existential threat to our national secu-
rity, economy, and the future we leave
to our children.
This is a global problem that requires
urgent international solutions, but the
Trump administration is dangerously
squandering this crucial moment.
Quite simply, we are running out of
time.
By formally beginning withdrawal
from the Paris climate agreement, the
President is ceding American leader-
ship on climate and actively under-
mining critical efforts to curb emis-
sions and transition to a clean energy
economy.
As signatory countries around the
world meet this week for a conference
in Madrid, I am introducing a resolu-
tion, joined by more than 100 of my
House colleagues as original cospon-
sors, condemning the administration’s
actions. This resolution sends a strong
message that the House opposes the
President’s reckless, irresponsible deci-
sion to abandon the climate agree-
ment, and we stand ready to fulfill the
commitments that our Nation made
under the Paris Agreement to address
the climate threat.
I urge my colleagues to join me in
this clear call for global action and
critically needed U.S. leadership.
f
WAGES ARE RISING IN SOUTH
CAROLINA
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.
Madam Speaker, yesterday, Jessica
Holdman with The Post and Courier re-
ported that wages in South Carolina
rose faster than expected this year and
will continue to rise. I was alerted to
this by Gary David and Christopher
Thompson on WVOC by iHeartRadio. I
am grateful for President Donald
Trump’s actions to increase wages by
reducing taxes and regulations.
According to Doug Woodward, econo-
mist with the University of South
Carolina’s Darla Moore School of Busi-
ness, this is the best job market we
have seen in a generation. USC econo-
mist Joey Von Nessen says, ‘‘workers
are in high demand right now, and we
are seeing strong wage growth as a re-
sult. This includes wage growth for
workers across the pay scale, with
those on the lower end benefiting the
most.’’
By creating jobs, raising wages, and
consistently working to promote op-
portunities, President Trump is con-
tinuing his record of keeping his prom-
ises. I am grateful that President
Trump is focused to work for American
families and jobs, despite the failed
Russian hoax and today the impeach-
ment hoax.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.
f
CUTS TO SNAP AFFECT EVERYONE
(Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam
Speaker, I want to talk about the ad-
ministration’s move to cut hundreds of
thousands of people from SNAP, our
Nation’s safety net for those faced with
food insecurity.
By the USDA’s own estimates, nearly
700,000 people will be hurt by this pol-
icy. 700,000, that is appalling. That is
700,000 people who will struggle to feed
themselves while they work towards
getting back on their feet. That is
700,000 people who will have to decide
whether to pay their bills or go hungry.
But this doesn’t just affect those who
will be cut from the food assistance
program, this affects everyone. SNAP
dollars are spent in local small busi-
nesses and help bring money to strug-
gling communities. Simply put, this
rule will make more people go hungry
and hurt our communities in the proc-
ess.
In Congress, we worked together on
this issue. We reached a consensus, and
we passed bipartisan legislation. So
this policy is not what we passed, and
it is not what the American people
want. I am calling on this administra-
tion to stop this cruel policy.

who contributed greatly to the arts,
education, and business community
throughout southwest Virginia.
Among the many civic leadership
roles held during his lifetime, Mr.
Porterfield served on the Virginia
Council on Higher Education, was
president of the Taubman Museum of
Art, and the Roanoke Valley Chamber
of Commerce in addition to being
chairman of both the Roanoke Valley
Business Council and the United Way
of Roanoke Valley.
Mr. Porterfield believed in Roanoke’s
potential and knew that the Star City
could play a pivotal role in cultural de-
velopment. As a veteran, a Roanoke
native, and an innate leader, Mr.
Porterfield believed that it was his
life’s purpose to serve others and his
community.
I am grateful for the commitment
and passion Bittle Porterfield had for
the Roanoke Valley and wish to extend
my deepest sympathies to his family
for their loss. May they find peace in
knowing that his legacy of service will
live on through the countless lives he
touched.

CALLING ATTENTION TO LYME
DISEASE
(Mr. DELGADO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. DELGADO. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to call attention to an ur-
gent issue in upstate New York. Lyme
and tick-borne diseases are deeply
prevalent in my district, New York 19,
and across the country.
From 2007 to 2017, Lyme disease cases
rose by 78 percent in my district. Ap-
proximately half of adult deer ticks in
the State carry the bacteria that
causes Lyme disease. We should be
doing all we can to address this and in-
vest in more effective ways to both di-
agnose and treat this disease.
That is why this week, I, along with
fellow members of the bipartisan Lyme
Disease Caucus, introduced legislation
to supplement congressionally appro-
priated funding for research with the
Stamp Out Lyme Disease Act. Our bill
would create a postage stamp to raise
awareness about the disease and di-
rectly support medical research to
treat and cure tick-borne illnesses.
I urge the House to take up this leg-
islation and move us closer to a cure.
f
RECOGNIZING THE REPEAL OF
PROHIBITION
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize the repeal of prohibition. On this
day in 1933, the 21st Amendment was
ratified, ending the prohibition of alco-
hol.
Today, throughout Pennsylvania,
breweries, wineries, and distilleries
have become one of the Common-
wealth’s fastest growing industries,
and quite frankly, agri-businesses.
Pennsylvania is home to more than 300
wineries, which produce more than 1.6
million gallons of wine each year. This
equates to roughly $1.4 billion in eco-
nomic impact.
Recently, Woody Lodge Winery, a
disabled veteran and female-owned
business from Cambria County, racked
up six awards at the Atlantic Seaboard
Wine Association competition, includ-
ing two best-in-category awards.
The craft beer industry is also boom-
ing. Each year, craft brewers pump
nearly $6 billion into Pennsylvania’s
economy and are responsible for more
than 100,000 jobs and generate $2.2 bil-
lion in wages. For the past three years,
Pennsylvania has been the number one
producer of craft beer in the Nation.
As we look back on 13 long years of
prohibition in this country, let’s raise
a glass to how far we have come in the
86 years since.

THE AMERICAN PEOPLE STAND
BEHIND THE INTERNATIONAL
FIGHT TO COMBAT CLIMATE
CHANGE
(Ms. BROWNLEY of California asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute.)
Ms. BROWNLEY of California.
Madam Speaker, this past week I had
the privilege to join Speaker PELOSI
and several of my colleagues at the 2019
United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change in Madrid, com-
monly known as COP25.
Our visit sent a message: No matter
what the current President says or
does, the American people stand behind
the international fight to combat cli-
mate change. We are still in.
Our only chance to stop the climate
crisis is for the entire world to come
together on solutions to stop pollution,
protect public health, and build a clean
energy economy. I was greatly encour-
aged and reinvigorated by the world
leaders I met in Madrid who were deep-
ly passionate and understand the ur-
gency in finding ways forward on this
global crisis.
I pledge to bring that passion back to
the House as a member of the Select
Committee on the Climate Crisis as we
continue our work to put together an
action plan for both Congress and our
country.

HONORING MAHANTONGO VALLEY
FARM FOR WHITE HOUSE
CHRISTMAS TREE
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Mahantongo Valley
Farm owners Larry and Joanne Sny-
der, who reside in Pennsylvania’s
Ninth District and whose farm is lo-
cated in Schuylkill and Northumber-
land Counties.
One of their beautiful Christmas
trees was selected by the President and
First Lady to adorn the Blue Room in
the White House during this holiday
season.
The Snyder’s magnificent 23-foot
Douglas fir was personally delivered
last week by the Snyder family to the
White House, where they were greeted
by First Lady Melania Trump.
Mahantongo Valley Farms has been
in the Snyder family for over 200 years,
but this is the first time one of their
trees has won the National Christmas
Tree Contest. There are over 13,000
Christmas tree farms across the coun-
try, making this a truly remarkable
accomplishment.
Madam Speaker, I would like to
thank the Snyder family for their con-
tribution to this wonderful Christmas
tradition and for making Pennsylvania
and particularly Pennsylvania’s Ninth
District very proud.
f
ADDRESS URGENT PRIORITIES OF
AMERICA
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, it
has been less than a year since Demo-
crats took back the majority in the
House. In that short time, we have
passed nearly 400 bills to get govern-
ment working for the people again, by
increasing access to quality, affordable
healthcare and protecting coverage for
preexisting conditions; by raising fam-
ily wages; by making bold investments
in rebuilding our Nation’s infrastruc-
ture; and by cleaning up corruption in
Washington and getting the govern-
ment to work for the people again.
We have sent more than 275 bipar-
tisan bills to the Senate, where MITCH
MCCONNELL is refusing to vote on
them. These bills include legislation to
protect and strengthen coverage for
preexisting conditions, to ensure equal
pay for equal work, and to fight back
against the debilitating effects of cli-
mate change and ban offshore drilling.
We also voted to give 33 million
Americans a long-overdue pay raise by
raising the minimum wage, provide
Gold Star families with much-needed
tax relief, and secure our Nation’s elec-
tions.
Yet, MITCH MCCONNELL has described
himself as the ‘‘grim reaper’’ and won’t
take up any of this legislation.
We are busy doing the work of the
American people. We have passed over
375 bipartisan bills that are sitting in
the Senate. It is time for the Senate to
take up these bills and address the ur-
gent priorities of the American people.

December 5, 2019
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, last
week, tragedy struck the South Lyon
community in Oakland County, Michi-
gan, as we learned of the death of
Trevon Tyler.
Just 17 years old, Trevon died from
complications following knee surgery.
Trevon was a beloved member of the
South Lyon community and a member
of the South Lyon East High School
football team.
His coach called him ‘‘the nicest,
most fun-loving, caring kid.’’ He
‘‘walked with a pretty big pep in his
step. He always said hi to everybody.
Everybody loved him. He was a little
bit of a jokester, had this big laugh, al-
ways made you smile.’’
Trevon’s incredible family, friends,
classmates, and teammates are all
heartbroken by his passing. His life
was cut tragically short, but he will al-
ways be remembered by that smile, his
laugh, his friendship, and his contribu-
tions to our community.
Today, we are called to live our lives
more like Tre, with joy and love at the
forefront.

The rule self-executes two manager’s
amendments offered by Chairman
ENGEL. The rule provides for 1 hour of
debate equally divided and controlled
by the chair and ranking member of
the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
Madam Speaker, the Voting Rights
Act of 1965 is one of the great legisla-
tive achievements of American history.
It is perhaps the greatest single statute
of the 20th century, in a century of
great statutes, including the National
Labor Relations Act and the Fair
Labor Standards Act.
But the Voting Rights Act was born
out of the blood, sweat, and tears of
the American civil rights movement;
in the wake of Freedom Summer; in
the murders of Schwerner, Chaney,
Goodman, and other civil rights heroes;
and in the after the famous March on
Washington, where Dr. King made his
‘‘I Have a Dream’’ speech.
The Voting Rights Act transformed
American politics by bringing into our
elections millions of voters who had
been disenfranchised for a century
after the Civil War ended. It changed
the nature of politics in the Deep
South and across the United States,
and it changed the politics of the
United States Congress as well.
Theoretically, the 13th, 14th, and 15th
Amendments had solved the problem of
disenfranchisement after the Civil War.
The 13th Amendment abolished slav-
ery; the 14th Amendment established
equal protection; and the 15th Amend-
ment banned discrimination in voting.
But after the dismantling of recon-
struction, African Americans were sub-
jected to a regime of disenfranchise-
ment that included violence, terror,
grandfather clauses, literacy tests, poll
taxes, and an ever-expanding panoply
of devices, tricks, and tactics to keep
Black people from being able to reg-
ister to vote and to participate in elec-
tions.
The civil rights movement and Presi-
dent Lyndon Johnson fought for the
Voting Rights Act, which passed in 1965
and which included a package of strong
remedies targeting discriminatory vot-
ing practices and devices in the areas
where discrimination was most egre-
gious and virulent.
A key component of the Voting
Rights Act was section 5, the
preclearance requirement, which com-
pelled covered States—that is, the
States to which it applied—to stop dis-
criminating and to subject all changes
in their voting practices to the Depart-
ment of Justice or to the United States
District Court for the District of Co-
lumbia.
States were covered if they had used
illegal voting discrimination devices
like literacy tests, poll taxes, and char-
acter exams, and if fewer than 50 per-
cent of the people were registered to
vote or allowed to participate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9266 December 5, 2019
The Voting Rights Act was chal-
lenged immediately in litigation called
South Carolina v. Katzenbach, but in
1966, the Supreme Court rejected argu-
ments that the Voting Rights Act vio-
lated the Constitution.
The Supreme Court said Congress
may use any rational means to effec-
tuate the constitutional prohibition on
race discrimination in voting. It upheld
the preclearance requirement against
attack.
Specifically, it was said by South
Carolina that it violated the so-called
equal footing doctrine, but the Su-
preme Court said that the equal foot-
ing doctrine applied to the admission
of States and not to the Congress’
power under section 5 of the 14th
Amendment or section 2 of the 15th
Amendment.
All of this worked for the Voting
Rights Act to usher in a new era of real
democracy in America. The
preclearance requirement meant that
the States, counties, and jurisdictions
that had been discriminating had to
submit to the Department of Justice or
to Federal court their plans for
changes. That worked to enfranchise
millions of voters across America. It
worked for the election of thousands of
African American elected officials at
the local, State, and Federal levels.
The genius of section 5 was that ju-
risdictions had to submit potentially
discriminatory changes before the
harm took place. Anybody can go
ahead and sue under section 2 after an
election is over, but then it is too late
because the harm has already been
done, the election has taken place. So
even if you win in court, the court is
not going to order a rerun of the elec-
tion. It is not going to require all the
voting to take place again, so it is too
late at that point.
Section 5 puts the burden on the po-
tentially discriminating parties to
prove that they are not discriminating
when they make changes in voting
laws.
It works all the way up until 2013,
when the Supreme Court rendered its
5–4 decision in Shelby County v. Hold-
er. The Shelby County case struck
down the section 4(b) formula for which
States were covered, declaring that
this formula was now out-of-date be-
cause it went back many, many dec-
ades to the 1960s and 1970s and that the
Congress would need to update the for-
mula to address current needs in the
field and to show that the formula re-
lates to the current problems that we
are targeting.
The Court said specifically that cov-
erage was based on decades-old data
and eradicated practices, like literacy
tests, which don’t exist anymore. So
when it got struck down, dozens of
States and counties that were pre-
viously required to preclear changes re-
lated to voting didn’t have to do it
anymore, and they began very quickly,
almost instantly, to roll back various
kinds of voter protections and to pass
strict voter identification laws, to pass
massive voter purges, to implement
cuts to early voting, to close polling
places, and so on.
I am going to read from one of the
witnesses who testified before the
House Judiciary Committee, Kristen
Clarke, the president and executive di-
rector of the Lawyers’ Committee for
Civil Rights, who said:
‘‘We have vetted complaints from
tens of thousands of voters in Shelby,
many revealing systemic voting dis-
crimination. In short, this is how
Shelby has impacted our democracy.
‘‘First, we have seen the resurgence
of discriminatory voting practices,
some motivated by intentional dis-
crimination, and this discrimination
has been most intense in the very juris-
dictions that were once covered by sec-
tion 5. They range from the consolida-
tion of polling sites to make it less
convenient for minority voters to vote
to the curtailing of early voting hours,
the purging of minority voters from
the rolls under the pretext of list main-
tenance, strict photo ID requirements,
abuse of signature match verification
requirements . . . , the threat of crimi-
nal prosecution, and more.

‘‘Second, we have seen increased lev-
els of recalcitrants in hostility among
elected officials who institute and re-
institute discriminatory voting
changes with impunity. . . .’’
‘‘Third, the loss of public notice re-
garding changes in voting practices
that could have a discriminatory effect
is significant. . . .’’
‘‘Fourth, the public no longer has the
ability to participate in the process of
reviewing practices before they take
effect. . . .’’
‘‘Fifth, the preclearance process had
an identifiable deterrent effect that is
now lost.
‘‘Sixth, the status quo is not sustain-
able. Civil rights organizations are
stepping up to fill the void created by
the Shelby decision at insurmountable
expense.
‘‘And finally, this will be the first re-
districting cycle in decades’’ in which
redistricting takes place without the
Voting Rights Act.
That is one example of testimony
that we got from all over America
about what the Shelby County v. Hold-
er decision meant by dismantling sec-
tion 5 by knocking out section 4(b) of
the Voting Rights Act.
H.R. 4 is doing precisely what the Su-
preme Court invited us to do in the
Shelby County decision: to pass a new
coverage formula for the Civil Rights
Act preclearance requirement based on
new data in a new formula designed to
address current contemporary prob-
lems.
The Judiciary Committee and the
House Administration Committee had
a combined total of 17 hearings: 9 on
the Judiciary side with its Sub-
committee on the Constitution, Civil
Rights and Civil Liberties, and 8 in the
House Administration Committee’s
Subcommittee on Elections. They
heard about restrictive and discrimina-
tory practices taking place in numer-
ous States across the country, includ-
ing Texas and Georgia, where, after the
end of preclearance, Georgia voters
faced a myriad of new voting barriers,
including the closure of more than 200
precinct polling places, spoiled voter
registration materials, purging of more
than 1 million voters in a racially dis-
criminatory way, restrictive voter ID
laws, systematic rejection of absentee
ballots, and more.
We also looked in North Carolina,
which passed a so-called monster voter
suppression law, which resulted in race
discrimination in accessing the polls,
including the closure of dozens of poll-
ing sites and long voting lines. The law
eliminated same-day voter registra-
tion, reduced early voting by a week,
curtailed satellite polling sites for el-
derly and disabled voters, and so on.
Madam Speaker, this legislation is
the product of massive legislative in-
spection of voting conditions across
the United States of America today,
and it threads the needle that was of-
fered to us by the Supreme Court in
the Shelby County decision by amend-
ing the Voting Rights Act to revise the
section 4(b) criteria and providing
other voter protections at the same
time.
Specifically, the bill creates a new
coverage formula that applies to all
States and hinges on a finding of re-
peated voting violations in the pre-
ceding 25 years.
It establishes a process for reviewing
voting changes in jurisdictions nation-
wide, focused on a limited set of meas-
ures such as voter ID laws and the re-
duction of multilingual voting mate-
rials; it requires reasonable public no-
tice for voting changes; it allows the
Attorney General authority to request
Federal observers; and it increases ac-
cessibility and protection for Native
American and Alaska Native voters.
Just turning, now, to H.R. 326, for
more than 20 years, American Presi-
dents from both political parties and
Israeli Prime Ministers have supported
reaching a two-state solution that es-
tablishes a democratic Palestinian
state to coexist peacefully and con-
structively side by side with a demo-
cratic Israel.
Middle East peace talks have favored
the two-state solution and opposed set-
tlement expansions, moves towards
unilateral annexation of territories,
and efforts to arrive at Palestinian
statehood outside the framework of ne-
gotiations with Israel.
In 2002, President Bush stated: ‘‘My
vision is two states, living side by side
in peace and security.’’
In 2013, President Obama reiterated
this exact same commitment, stating
that: ‘‘Negotiations will be necessary,
but there is little secret about where
they must lead—two states for two
peoples.’’
This resolution emphasizes the senti-
ment of the past 20 years of peace talks

by expressing the sense of this House of
Representatives that only a two-state
solution to the Israeli-Palestinian con-
flict can ensure Israel’s survival as a
secure democratic state and fulfill the
legitimate aspirations for a secure and
democratic Palestinian state. It fur-
ther expresses the sense that any U.S.
proposal that fails to endorse a two-
state solution will put a peaceful end
to the conflict only further out of
reach.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume,
and I thank Representative RASKIN for
yielding me the customary 30 minutes.
Madam Speaker, the right to vote is
of paramount importance in our Re-
public. We all agree on that. Prohibi-
tions against discriminatory barriers
to the right to vote have been grounded
in Federal law since the Civil War and,
more recently, through the Voting
Rights Act of 1965.
We all agree: Discrimination should
have no place in our voting system.
However, the majority would have us
believe that the Voting Rights Act
does not prevent any of this and would
rather pass this partisan legislation for
a Federal takeover of elections.
I anticipate that the 2013 Supreme
Court case Shelby County v. Holder
will be brought up many times today,
but I would like to point out to my
Democratic colleagues that, in that de-
cision, the Supreme Court only struck
down one outdated provision of the
Voting Rights Act.
This provision, section 4(b), was
struck down because it was outdated as
it had not been updated since 1975, and
it violated principles of equal State
sovereignty and federalism. H.R. 4 is,
quite simply, unconstitutional, as the
Supreme Court had held that Federal
control over local elections is allowed
only when there is proof of discrimina-
tory treatment in voting.
Further, I believe it is important to
point out that other very important
provisions of the Voting Rights Act re-
main in place, including section 2 and
section 3.
Section 2 applies nationwide and pro-
hibits voting practices or procedures
that discriminate on the basis of race,
color, or the ability to speak English.
Section 2 is enforced through Federal
lawsuits just like every other Federal
civil rights law, and the United States
and civil rights organizations have
brought many cases to enforce the
guarantees of section 2 in court, and
they may do so in the future, as well.
Section 3 of the Voting Rights Act
also remains in place. This section au-
thorizes Federal courts to impose
preclearance requirements on States
and political subdivisions that have en-
acted voting procedures that treat peo-
ple differently based on race in viola-
tion of the 14th and 15th Amendments.
If a Federal court finds a State or a
political subdivision to have treated
people differently based on race, then
the court has discretion now to retain
supervisory jurisdiction and impose
preclearance requirements as they see
fit until a future date at the court’s
discretion. This is all valid now with-
out this bill.
Section 3 has been utilized recently,
in fact. U.S. District Judge Lee Rosen-
thal issued an opinion in a redis-
tricting case that required that the
city of Pasadena, Texas, be monitored
by the Justice Department because it
had intentionally changed its city
council districts to decrease Hispanic
influence.
States should be allowed to imple-
ment their own laws regarding their
elections and voting security to ensure
all results are accurate on election
day. State and local governments know
more about how to handle their elec-
tions than bureaucrats in Washington,
D.C.
I applaud State and local govern-
ments that are taking the necessary
steps to modernize and secure their
elections. For example, in Arizona, my
home State, we have made continual
progress on improving voter turnout
and participation.
Mr. RASKIN said that the section that
was taken out by the courts was ge-
nius. Well, I believe the opposite is
true.
Arizona was under this outdated
preclearance formula, and I can tell
you personally that this section was
not genius. Both Arizona Democrats
and Republicans, alike, thought to
have to preclear every single decision
that elected election officials made
with the Federal bureaucrats in Wash-
ington, D.C., was a total disaster.
Arizona now has free, open, and se-
cure elections, despite not being under
this Federal control preclearance any-
more. Nearly 80 percent of Arizonans
vote by mail. We have a robust online
voter registration system, so it is easy
to register to vote. We have approxi-
mately 1 month of early voting.
While Arizona has made voting easier
and more accessible for voters, we have
also made our elections more secure by
outlining the practice of ballot har-
vesting. In Arizona, we believe it
should be easy to vote and hard to
cheat. The policies in Arizona seem to
be working, as we have seen in election
after election that voter turnout con-
tinues to grow.
A couple months ago, I had the op-
portunity to participate in a field hear-
ing in Phoenix, Arizona, to discuss the
Voting Rights Act. There, I spoke with
staff of the Maricopa County Recorder,
an elected Democrat. She relayed to
me how disappointed they were to not
have been asked to testify at this hear-
ing as they felt that they had not been
able to speak to the story of the suc-
cesses in Arizona and why they were
very concerned about H.R. 4. They did
not want the Federal Government
preclearing every single decision they
made.
Think about it: They don’t want to
have to go back to the Federal Govern-
ment every single time they change
early ballots or voting locations. They,
instead, are making great progress and
strides. Voter turnout has soared. They
don’t want bureaucrats in Washington,
D.C., slowing down important and
time-sensitive decisions.
This rule also includes H. Res. 326.
I am curious why my Democratic col-
leagues decided to bring forward this
nonbinding resolution as opposed to
bringing up H.R. 336, a bill that I am
personally a proud cosponsor of, which
is identical to the text of S. 1, the
Strengthening America’s Security in
the Middle East Act of 2019, which
passed the Senate by a vote of 77–23—
totally bipartisan—on February 5, 2019.
Instead of the nonbinding resolution
we have before us today, H.R. 336 would
take concrete steps to counter the BDS
movement against Israel.
b 1245
Instead, I am saddened the Demo-
crats brought up this resolution, a res-
olution that rebukes and ties the hands
of the Trump administration and em-
barrasses Israel. In fact, the resolution
expressly states a proposal must be put
forward that is consistent with pre-
vious administrations’ proposals, com-
pletely undercutting the Trump admin-
istration. This should not be a partisan
issue with only Democrat sponsors and
not one Republic cosponsor as this bill
has. We should not be handicapping our
President.
My Republican colleagues on the
Foreign Affairs Committee tell me
that a resolution that supports a two-
state solution, without attempting to
undermine the President, could have
been bipartisan. However, this resolu-
tion singles out settlement expansion
and annexation. These are some of the
most delicate issues in our bilateral re-
lationship with Israel, and it shines a
spotlight on them in the middle of an
ongoing and contentious time in Israel.
The resolution spells out specific
Palestinian Authority demands with-
out listing critical Israeli pre-
conditions, such as acknowledging
Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state
with an undivided Jerusalem as Israel’s
capital and providing assurances for
Israel’s safety and security through a
demilitarized zone.
As a whole, this resolution dispropor-
tionately criticizes the Israeli Govern-
ment while failing to recognize the
dangerous actions targeting innocent
Israelis that further remove the possi-
bility of peace.
We already voted to support a two-
state solution over the summer in H.
Res. 246 in a bipartisan manner.
So why do we need this partisan bill?
So, Madam Speaker, I urge opposi-
tion to this rule, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
My good friend from Arizona chides me
for having described section 5, the
preclearance requirement of the Voting
Rights Act, as genius, which is amaz-
ing to me because this has been a bi-
partisan national commitment and a

bipartisan commitment in Congress
since 1965 when it passed on a bipar-
tisan basis, since 1982 when it was reau-
thorized on a bipartisan basis, and
since 2006 when President Bush signed
it, as well, and celebrated it.
So we have had Presidents Bush,
Clinton, and Obama, a continuous
array of Presidents, supporting it, and
Congresses supporting it.
If you don’t have it, here is what hap-
pens: The NAACP Legal Defense Fund
testified to us about successful litiga-
tion they had in Texas against a re-
strictive voter ID law that had dis-
criminatory racial impact. They won
on the lawsuit under section 2, but it
was too late.
In the meantime, who was elected in
Texas?
A U.S. Senator, all 36 Members of the
House of Representatives, a Governor,
a lieutenant governor, and so on.
The reason why section 5 is genius
and why we need to restore the
precoverage formula is because it re-
quires States to submit in advance
laws that could be potentially dis-
criminatory.
I was amazed to hear again the lan-
guage of federalizing control and a
Federal takeover of elections when this
has been a bipartisan commitment for
decades grounded in the Constitution
of the United States which tells us in
Article I, Section 4 we can regulate
elections; Section 2 of the Fifteenth
Amendment saying we can regulate
elections to prevent race discrimina-
tion; Section 5 of the Fourteenth
Amendment, and the republican Guar-
antee Clause, which tells us we must
guarantee to people of the States a re-
publican form of government, which
means representative government
based on democracy.
Finally, I will allow my friend to por-
tray what is going on in her State her
way, and she paints a lovely picture. I
would just refer her to page 25 of the
Judiciary Committee report which says
that in Arizona polling places were
closed throughout the State, many
with significant populations of Latino
voters, in advance of the 2016 election.
Maricopa County, 31 percent Latino,
closed 171 polling places, Mohave Coun-
ty closed 34, and so on. So there is an-
other story to be told there which is
embodied in the work.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.
GOTTHEIMER).
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker,
I thank Mr. RASKIN for yielding me
time.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
the rule which adopts bipartisan lan-
guage which I introduced with my good
friends, Congressman TOM REED and
Congressman TED DEUTCH, reaffirming
the United States’ ironclad commit-
ment to providing security assistance
to our historic ally, Israel, which, as
ever, is key to America’s national secu-
rity in the region, especially in our
fight against terror.
This vote officially puts to rest the
splinter view of adding new conditions
on aid to Israel and reinforces our his-
toric commitment to restoring a two-
state solution.
I want to thank my good friend,
House Foreign Affairs Committee
Chairman ELIOT ENGEL, for his leader-
ship on this issue and for including our
language in his manager’s amendment.
Madam Speaker, as we have seen in
recent weeks, Israel, the democracy in
the region, faces threats like no other
country of missile and rocket attacks
from terrorist organizations, including
Hamas, Hezbollah, and Palestinian Is-
lamic Jihad, as well as the ongoing
threat of Iranian-backed forces in
Syria.
Vital security assistance to Israel,
including missile defense funding for
Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow 3,
helps our ally to defend itself and pre-
serve its qualitative military edge in
the region. That is why in 2016 under
the Obama administration, the U.S.
and Israel signed a 10-year Memo-
randum of Understanding which con-
stituted the single largest pledge of se-
curity assistance to Israel in America
history. The MOU also increased the
amount of defense dollars that go to
U.S. businesses here at home, with as
much as $1.2 billion a year invested in
the United States.
We know that this aid helps save
countless lives, and we know that the
United States is better off when Israel
is fully equipped to defend itself. That
is why I led a bipartisan amendment
with my colleagues, Congressman REED
and Congressman DEUTCH, which reaf-
firms our commitment to providing
this assistance without additional con-
ditions or exceptions.
Our amendment was cosponsored by
a total of 36 Members of Congress, Re-
publicans and Democrats, who know
that this assistance should not be sub-
ject to politics. I deeply appreciate all
of our colleagues’ support for our
amendment, for this vital, lifesaving
assistance, and for the bipartisan U.S.-
Israel relationship.
This language is absolutely necessary
because of the extreme and misguided
views of some, especially several cur-
rently running for our Nation’s highest
office, who seemingly believe that as-
sistance to Israel should be held hos-
tage until Israel makes concessions ac-
cording to their beliefs, including how
Israel treats Gaza, which is controlled
by the foreign terrorist organization
Hamas.
We must stand together in rejecting
that harmful view—as one Senator
called it, the view of having leverage
against Israel, our ally.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield
the gentleman from New Jersey 10 ad-
ditional seconds.
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker,
when our ally, Israel, faces more than
450 rockets fired by Palestinian and
Jihad terrorists in Gaza, it must have
the ability to defend itself, no matter
what.
That is why with this vote we com-
mit ourselves to strengthening the
U.S.-Israel relationship by ensuring
that we fulfill our guarantee to provide
vital security assistance to the key de-
mocracy in the region.
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
4 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS).
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois.
Madam Speaker, I thank my good
friend, Mrs. LESKO, for her participa-
tion in the Election Subcommittee
hearing in Phoenix.
Also, Madam Speaker, I want to
thank you personally for your hard
work in making sure that every person
throughout this great Nation gets that
opportunity to vote and for your work
in furthering civil discussion and civil
rights in your career.
Madam Speaker, I do rise in opposi-
tion to the rule for H.R. 4 today.
The Voting Rights Act is currently in
place. The bill that we will be debating
tomorrow is not a reauthorization of
this important and historically bipar-
tisan legislation that has prevented
discrimination at the ballot box.
It has only been since the U.S. Su-
preme Court decision in Shelby County
v. Holder that Democrats have decided
to politicize the Voting Rights Act.
This landmark decision left the vast
majority of the Voting Rights Act in
place.
What it struck down was 40-year-old
data and the formula used to determine
which States were to be placed under
the control of the Department of Jus-
tice, known as preclearance. The Su-
preme Court deemed this data and for-
mula was no longer accurate nor rel-
evant for our country’s current cli-
mate.
The 2013 opinion held that regardless
of how to look at the record, no one
can fairly say that it shows anything
approaching the pervasive, flagrant,
widespread, and rampant discrimina-
tion that faced Congress in 1965, and
that clearly distinguished the covered
jurisdictions from the rest of the Na-
tion.
So what does H.R. 4 do?
It doubles down and would attempt
to put every State and jurisdiction
under preclearance. This is a bill to
federalize elections, regardless of what
my colleagues have said in this institu-
tion today. During last night’s Rules
Committee meeting, it became clear
that the majority was unable to deter-
mine the number of States or jurisdic-
tions that would be covered by this
preclearance if H.R. 4 were to become
law tomorrow. Apparently, we have to
pass this bill before the American peo-
ple can even find out if they would be
subjected to it.
This is a proposition that the major-
ity knows is bad policy, and it is a non-
starter for myself, my colleagues in
this Chamber, and those in the other
body across this Capitol, the Supreme
Court, too, but perhaps most impor-
tantly, the thousands of local election

officials across the country who would
be crippled if this bill were to ever be-
come law.
H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act, is not a Voting Rights Act
reauthorization bill. This is only about
preclearance and the Democratic ma-
jority giving the Department of Justice
control over all election activity.
While it is not in my committee’s ju-
risdiction in the House Administration
Committee, our Subcommittee on
Elections majority held seven field
hearings and one listening session
across the U.S., encompassing eight
different States and over 13,000 miles of
air travel. Even with this gargantuan
effort, the Democrats were still unable
to produce a single voter who wanted
to vote and was unable to cast a ballot.
This is a great thing. We ought to
celebrate it. Credit should be given to
the Voting Rights Act for helping to
achieve this. The 2018 midterm election
produced the highest voting turnout in
four decades according to data from
the Census Bureau, especially among
minority voters. That, again, should be
celebrated.
Sections 2 and 3 of the Voting Rights
Act that are currently in effect are
continuing to safeguard the public
from discrimination at the ballot box.
Every eligible American who wants to
vote in our country’s elections should
be able to cast a ballot. That is why we
have the Voting Rights Act, a great ex-
ample of a bipartisan solution that is
working to help Americans today and
protecting Americans from discrimina-
tion.
Unfortunately, H.R. 4 is just a polit-
ical attempt from the Democrats to
give the Federal Government more
control over how States run their elec-
tions. I have now seen four voting bills
from the majority come to this floor.
All of them have one common theme,
and that is to federalize elections.
I urge my colleagues to vote against
this rule.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5
minutes to the gentlewoman from Ala-
bama (Ms. SEWELL), who has been such
a magnificent leader on this legisla-
tion.
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, today I proudly rise to support the
rule on H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act of 2019.
Voting rights are primal. They are
the cornerstone of our democracy. No
right is more precious to our citizen-
ship than the right of all Americans to
be able to vote. When Americans are
not able to cast their ballots, their
votes are silenced, and we, especially
as elected officials, should be alarmed
if any American who wants to cast a
ballot is unable to cast a ballot.
What H.R. 4 does is it restores the
Voting Rights Act of 1965 by giving a
new coverage formula. In fact, the Rob-
erts Court specifically said in striking
down section 4(b) that it was outdated.
So H.R. 4 is our effort, the efforts of
three committees, hours of testimony,
lots and lots of stakeholders, and lots
and lots of people who were American
citizens not able to vote; it is that ef-
fort that led to a narrowly tailored new
coverage formula. That new coverage
formula does not look back to the 1960s
or to the 1970s. It looks back 25 years,
that is 1994 and going forward.
It requires adjudicated violations of
voter discrimination. It is narrowly
tailored, and it hits the mark as to
what the Supreme Court requires us to
do in saying that Congress could feel
free to update its coverage formula.
The Supreme Court and Roberts, in
his opinion, also said that voter dis-
crimination still existed. It admitted
that it still existed. And H.R. 4 is our
effort to actually provide a modern-day
voter coverage formula that will allow
States and jurisdictions with the most
egregious forms of discrimination to be
required to preclear.
b 1300
The Shelby v. Holder decision origi-
nated out of Shelby County, Alabama.
I am honored every day to represent
Alabama’s Seventh Congressional Dis-
trict. It is a district that knows all too
well the importance of voting.
You see, my district includes not
only Birmingham and Montgomery but
my hometown of Selma, Alabama. It
was on a bridge in my hometown that
our colleague JOHN LEWIS and so many
other foot soldiers bled on that bridge
for the equal right of all Americans to
be able to vote.
This is exactly what H.R. 4 does. It
restores the full protections of the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965. In so doing, it
provides a mechanism by which the
most egregious States and localities
must preclear before the elections. It is
so hard to unring the bell once an elec-
tion has already taken place. So sec-
tion 2, while it has been used to liti-
gate and to get good results, it only
can occur after the election has taken
place.
So I say to you, Mr. Speaker, that
this is not only an important piece of
legislation for our Nation to ensure
that every American—American—who
has the ability, who is 18 years of age
or older, has the right to access a bal-
lot box.
It is clear to me that since the
Shelby v. Holder decision, so many
States have now instituted voter dis-
crimination laws. Some of them have
been in the guise of voter fraud, but
the Brennan Center and so many oth-
ers have found that voter fraud hap-
pens minisculely in any election.
It is not about voter fraud. It is
about voter suppression, suppressing
the voices of certain Americans. And
that is un-American, Mr. Speaker.
Just the 2018 midterm elections alone
highlight the voter discrimination that
occurred.
In Georgia, the Republican candidate
for Governor used his power as sec-
retary of state to put 53,000 voter reg-
istrations on hold, nearly 70 percent of
which belonged to African American
voters.
In North Dakota, Republicans estab-
lished a new requirement that voters
must show an ID that they live at a
residential street address. It was not
enough that they had a P.O. Box. That
law was a barrier to thousands of Na-
tive Americans who live on reserva-
tions and use P.O. Boxes rather than
residential street addresses.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
DOGGETT). The time of the gentle-
woman has expired.
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an
additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman.
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, as my colleague from Maryland has
shown, in Maricopa County, Arizona,
which I think is where the gentle-
woman is from, there is still voter dis-
crimination.
Mr. Speaker, this is a seminal piece
of legislation that will restore rights
for the people. All of us, Republicans
and Democrats, should be about mak-
ing sure it is easier to vote, not harder
to vote.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
vote for the rule and the underlying
legislation, H.R. 4.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5

Let’s be clear, H. Res. 326 is a one-
sided, partisan, and ill-timed resolu-
tion. This past summer, Members of
this Chamber came to the floor and
passed, almost unanimously, a very
strong statement opposing the Boy-
cott, Divestment and Sanctions move-
ment, as well as much of the language
that is in this resolution, H. Res. 326.
This is actually a watered-down
version of what we passed last summer.
There is nothing in this resolution that
we didn’t already pass almost unani-
mously last summer.
So, what happened? We woke up the
day after that resolution passed last
summer, and the Republicans wanted
to pass legislation with teeth. I know
that we have a lot of strong, bipartisan
support for passing legislation with
teeth, S.1/H.R. 336, legislation that al-
ready passed the Senate with almost 80
votes. But, unfortunately, for some of
my colleagues, they woke up the next
day and instead of wanting to pass leg-
islation with teeth that would do some-
thing about it, do something about
that strong statement that we made,
we have been seeing this resolution
passed as the main effort for the second
half of this year.
In the last 2 years, Israel has been hit
by over 2,600 rockets and mortars, and
1,500 of those rockets were fired from
the Gaza Strip into Israel in the past
year alone. Last week, every headline
in the region was about Israel being
bombarded with over 450 rockets, and
that was just one moment in time.

ognize these latest attacks but all the

persistent assaults on innocent Israelis
by Palestinian terrorists. Notice this
resolution is reprimanding Israel, but
it says nothing about Palestinian ter-
rorists.
My friend on the other side of the
aisle, when he was giving his opening
remarks, was reprimanding Israel and
didn’t say anything about Palestinian
terrorists murdering innocent Israelis;
nothing about the pay-to-slay program
where the Palestinians financially re-
ward terrorism and incite violence;
nothing about Hamas denying humani-
tarian aid, calling jihad an obligation,
and saying that they do not recognize
Israel as a Jewish state.
This reality is lost in this resolution.
This resolution completely fails to
mention that Israel has made repeated
attempts to offer peace proposals to
the Palestinian Authority. Time and
again, the Palestinian Authority has
rejected peace proposals because they
refuse publicly and privately to accept
a Jewish state in Israel.
This resolution is silent on funda-
mental facts that shape the way Israel
has dealt with this constant threat on
its border. This resolution chooses to
reference President Obama’s policy to-
ward Israel while intentionally leaving
out President Trump’s policy, ensuring
a partisan outcome for this resolution.
Support for Israel in this Chamber
has long been bipartisan. For whatever
reason, the majority is choosing to ad-
vance in the resolution tomorrow that
is going to have one of the most par-
tisan votes to ever take place regard-
ing Israel in the history of the House of
Representatives. Congratulations.
H. Res. 326 undercuts the administra-
tion’s efforts to strengthen our critical
alliance with our greatest ally, Israel,
and the timing of this vote is fooling
no one. This resolution is a clear re-
buke to the Trump administration’s re-
cent reversal of the Obama administra-
tion’s targeting of Israel with U.N. Se-
curity Council Resolution 2334.
If House Democrats want to pass bi-
partisan legislation with teeth, they
should bring S.1/H.R. 336, which has al-
ready passed the Senate, as I men-
tioned, with strong, bipartisan support
and was introduced by Congressman
MICHAEL MCCAUL in the House. There
is even a discharge petition led by Con-
gressman BRIAN MAST for this bill that
has almost 200 signatures on it. If it
came to a vote in this Chamber, it
would pass.
How about we focus on passing legis-
lation that gets through the House? It
has already been through the Senate.
It will be signed by the President. We
will be doing something about that
strong statement that we made last
summer.
I urge all of my colleagues to vote
against this rule and against this par-
tisan resolution.
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, all I
will observe is that the gentleman from
New York oddly begins by attacking a
resolution for being a recycled version
of language we have already adopted on
a massive bipartisan basis in the
House. Then he closes by attacking us
for this resolution being partisan and
divisive in some way. Obviously, those
two things don’t match up.
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOG-
GETT).
Mr. DOGGETT. Voting rights guar-
antee all of our other rights. When
Americans are obstructed from freely
participating in elections, our democ-
racy is imperiled.
This bill, six long years overdue, re-
stores a key provision of the Voting
Rights Act that was wrongfully nul-
lified by Republican-appointed justices.
How troubling that a law that Presi-
dent Lyndon Johnson long ago secured
now is being obstructed, while our
home State of Texas has become
ground zero for voter suppression.
State Republicans have aggressively,
illegally purged voting rolls. They
eliminated mobile voting to quash es-
pecially student and senior voters.
They enacted a cumbersome voter ID
law. And they horribly, illegally gerry-
mandered our State.
Republicans split 100 voting precincts
to create the district which I serve
today, creating one of the most crook-
ed districts that weaken the accessi-
bility and accountability of Congress
Members. A three-judge Federal court
with two Republican-appointed judges
unanimously condemned Texas redis-
tricting as intentional racially dis-
criminatory intent in its work.
Fortunately, the Texas Civil Rights
Project, MoveTexas, LULAC, and other
groups have challenged the suppres-
sion, but this bill is essential to offer
the protection that they, and our de-
mocracy, deserve.
We need preclearance in Texas. We
need preclearance to clear away all the
obstacles Republicans insist on impos-
ing to ensure that our State remains a
voter nonparticipation State for de-
mocracy.
Madam Speaker, let’s support H.R. 4.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
If we defeat the previous question, I
will bring to the floor H.R. 2207, the
Protect Medical Innovation Act of 2019,
which most people know as the bill
that will eliminate the medical device
tax.
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous
consent to insert the text of my
amendment in the RECORD, along with
extraneous material, immediately
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. SE-
WELL of Alabama). Is there objection to
the request of the gentlewoman from
Arizona?
There was no objection.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, H.R.
2207 was introduced by Mr. KIND from
Wisconsin, and it has 253 bipartisan co-
sponsors, including myself.
Since the medical device tax was im-
posed by the Affordable Care Act, com-
monly known as ObamaCare, folks
have known that it was detrimental to
innovation and to patient access to
necessary devices and treatments. The
2.3 percent excise tax has been sus-
pended twice because we know it is bad
policy. So what are we waiting for?
Madam Speaker, we should be bring-
ing legislation to this floor that show-
cases how we can work together. The
American people need to see us united
on issues as important as this. We need
to stand together when opportunities
like these arise to better the lives and
truly help all of our constituencies.
H.R. 2207 does just that.
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to
the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs.
WALORSKI).
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to urge my colleagues to op-
pose the previous question.
If we defeat the previous question,
Republicans will amend the rule to in-
clude the repeal of the medical device
tax.
The medical device tax takes effect
on January 1, 2020, unless Congress
acts. Time is of the essence. Yet, my
friends across the aisle continue to
waste our time and energy and, more
importantly, clock time that we need
to stop this tax from going into effect.
This is a bipartisan bill with 253 of us
cosponsoring it. All I am asking is that
the 253 cosponsors get an opportunity
before this expires to say stop this,
stop the wheels from grinding. Let’s do
something that counts for our fellow
Americans, for senior citizens who are
the recipients of a lot of these medical
device implants.
It brings quality of life. Oftentimes,
it brings the extension of very impor-
tant quality of life to seniors. It is less
time in hospitals. It has been proven—
back up on people’s feet to engage back
in the workforce and their part of the
American Dream.
Instead of having nothing happening
in a bipartisan way, as our fellow
Americans are watching what is hap-
pening in this House, if 253 of us agree
on this today, we can stop this onerous
tax. We can stop costing healthcare
and the exorbitant amount of increases
sent back down to all of our constitu-
ents.
This is a big deal in the State of Indi-
ana, where I come from. What we do in
the State of Indiana with 300 medical
device manufacturing companies sup-
porting nearly 55,000 good-paying
jobs—nationally, the industry directly
employs over half a million people.
b 1315
It is no understatement to say that
thousands of jobs are at stake if the
medical device tax comes back in 26
days. When the tax was in effect for the
3 years of 2012 to 2015, industry lost al-
most 30,000 jobs nationwide, according
to government data.
Madam Speaker, we should be focus-
ing on important, urgent, bipartisan
issues like this. We can do something
together to make our constituents and
to make our Nation better.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9271
December 5, 2019
I urge my colleagues to support this
important bill. Twenty-six days to go.
We can work together. Over 250 of us
are cosponsoring this legislation.
I ask, on behalf of every citizen, ev-
erybody working in the medical device
industry, and for the sake of our own
economy, let’s do something that
makes sense for this country.
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time to close.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, in
closing, H.R. 4 is totally partisan,
without one Republican cosponsor; and
H. Res. 326, another totally partisan
bill, ties the Trump administration’s
hands and embarrasses Israel.
Madam Speaker, I urge ‘‘no’’ on the
previous question, ‘‘no’’ on the under-
lying measure, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
I want to thank my friend from Ari-
zona, who rightfully invites us to focus
on legislation that will bring us to-
gether.
The gentlewoman from Indiana, who
I have not had the good fortune of
meeting yet, accuses me of wasting not
just time, but something called ‘‘clock
time,’’ which sounds like a really low
blow.
In any event, I think our legislation
actually will bring us together and
should bring us together. The rule is
for two pieces of legislation that I
thought ought to have and would have
complete bipartisan support.
The first is simply to update the
preclearance coverage formula, section
4(b) in the Voting Rights Act, as we
were instructed to do by the Supreme
Court in the Shelby County v. Holder
decision.
The Voting Rights Act is the product
of a massive political and social strug-
gle in the country to make America
move forward, but it had been sup-
ported by huge bipartisan majorities in
1965, in 1982, and in 2006. Yet, today,
our friends across the aisle now attack
it as a Federal takeover of State elec-
tions, which is absolutely flab-
bergasting that the Republican Party,
the party of Lincoln, is now attacking
the Voting Rights Act and the
preclearance requirement for being
some kind of assault on Federalism
when it vindicates the right of all
Americans to vote, as we are not only
authorized to do under the 14th and
15th Amendments, but we are obligated
to do under the republican Guarantee
Clause to make sure that all Ameri-
cans are in a representative relation-
ship with their government.
So I invite them to come on back
over to this side of the Voting Rights
Act.
Obviously, we are all for a two-state
solution, as American Presidents of
both parties have been for, for the last
several decades, so I invite them to
come back over for that, too.
This resolution cannot be both a
tired rehash of everything we have
done in the past, as was claimed, but
also some kind of partisan departure.
The partisan departure is on their side.
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote
on the rule and a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the
previous question.
The material previously referred to
by Mrs. LESKO is as follows:
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 741
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing:
SEC. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this
resolution, the House shall proceed to the
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R.
2207) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 to repeal the excise tax on medical de-
vices. All points of order against consider-
ation of the bill are waived. The bill shall be
considered as read. All points of order
against provisions in the bill are waived. The
previous question shall be considered as or-
dered on the bill and on any amendment
thereto to final passage without intervening
motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally
divided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on
Ways and Means; and (2) one motion to re-
commit.
SEC. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
consideration of the bill (H.R. 2534) to
amend the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 to prohibit certain securities trad-
ing and related communications by
those who possess material, nonpublic
information, with Ms. SEWELL of Ala-
bama in the chair.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the
bill is considered read the first time.
General debate shall be confined to
the bill and shall not exceed 1 hour
equally divided and controlled by the
chair and ranking minority member of
the Committee on Financial Services.
The gentlewoman from California
(Ms. WATERS) and the gentleman from
Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA) each will con-
trol 30 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Chairwoman, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Chairwoman, I rise in strong
support of H.R. 2534, the Insider Trad-
ing Prohibition Act, introduced by the
gentleman from Connecticut, Rep-
resentative JIM HIMES.
This long overdue bill creates a clear
definition of illegal insider trading
under the securities laws so that there
is a codified, consistent standard for
courts and market participants to bet-
ter protect the hard-earned savings of
millions of Americans and bring cer-
tainty to the U.S. securities market.
For nearly 80 years, the Securities
and Exchange Commission—that is, the
SEC—has sought to hold corporate in-
siders accountable for insider trading
through general statutory antifraud
provisions and rules it has promulgated
under those provisions. This has re-
sulted in a web of court decisions that
generally prohibit insiders with a duty
of trust and confidence to a corpora-
tion from secretly trading on material,
nonpublic corporate information for
their own personal gain.
These insiders are also generally pro-
hibited from tipping outsiders, known
as tippees, who then trade on the infor-
mation themselves, even though they
know it was wrongfully obtained.
But, because there isn’t a statutory
definition of ‘‘insider trading,’’ there is
uncertainty around who is subject to
insider trading prohibitions; and, with
various court decisions, liability for
this type of violation has shifted.
For example, in 2014, an appeals
court added a brand-new requirement
that the tippee must not just know
that information was wrongfully dis-
closed but must also know about the
specific personal benefit that the in-
sider received.
This decision has severely hampered
the SEC’s ability to prosecute insider
trading cases and, according to Preet
Bharara, the former U.S. attorney for
the Southern District of New York
‘‘provides a virtual roadmap for savvy
hedge fund managers to insulate them-
selves from tippee liability by know-
ingly placing themselves at the end of
a chain of insider information and
avoiding learning details about the
sources of obvious confidential and im-
properly disclosed information.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9272 December 5, 2019
So I am pleased that this bill codifies
existing case law and overturns this
new controversial requirement, cre-
ating a clear, consistent standard for
the SEC, the courts, and market par-
ticipants to follow, and does so in a
way that, as Columbia Law School pro-
fessor John Coffee testified before one
of our subcommittees, ‘‘expands liabil-
ity in ways that should not be con-
troversial.’’
I would like to commend Representa-
tive HIMES for his efforts since the bill
was marked up in May in committee to
ensure that it fairly reflects existing
law. In addition to extensive outreach
to current and former regulators and
prosecutors, investor advocates, and
institutional investors, Mr. HIMES also
repeatedly engaged with our colleagues
on the opposite side of the aisle.
As a result, Ranking Member
MCHENRY will offer an amendment
which will remove unnecessary ambi-
guities, clarify the intent of the bill to
reflect existing insider trading case
law, and ensure that the bill preserves
the SEC’s ability to bring bad actors to
justice under other related insider
trading laws.
I plan to support this amendment as
a reasonable bipartisan compromise, so
I urge all Members to support this
commonsense bill that makes the defi-
nition of illegal trading very clear for
all so that the SEC can effectively
crack down on corporate insiders who
illegally trade on inside information.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Chair, preventing fraud and
abuse within our financial system and
cracking down on bad actors for illegal
insider trading is a nonpartisan pri-
ority. This kind of fraud and illegal ac-
tivity hurts everyday investors, and it
also makes our markets less efficient,
accurate, and reliable.
Current law prohibits trading on ma-
terial insider information in breach of
a fiduciary duty under the antifraud
provisions of the Federal securities
law.
The Securities and Exchange Com-
mission and the Department of Justice
are the Federal agencies tasked with
enforcing insider trading. Both agen-
cies regularly use their authority by
bringing insider trading cases against
bad actors who violate our insider trad-
ing laws.
The SEC has not asked for this bill,
however, unlike other bills that Repub-
licans have voted for out of this House
in the past month. Moreover, Demo-
crats have not fully identified a prob-
lem within the current body of the law
that inhibits the prosecution of bad ac-
tors who illegally trade on material,
nonpublic information.
As it is written before us on the floor
at this moment, this bill could poten-
tially create more confusion and uncer-
tainty within the law of insider trad-
ing. It could even expand liability for
good faith traders, which would hurt
the efficiencies of our markets, chill
vital information gathering, and weak-
en investor confidence.
Republican and Democrat SEC chairs
alike, with vastly different approaches
to enforcement matters, have ex-
pressed concern over Congress codi-
fying a prohibition on insider trading
into one single statute. Specifically,
they voiced concerns that Congress
would write a law that could be both
overly broad and too narrow at the
same time.
I share their concerns with the bill as
drafted before us today, and I am
pleased to hear that the chair has indi-
cated that the majority will be accept-
ing the ranking member’s amendment
shortly.
I am concerned that the current
version of the bill, however, does not
include an explicit personal benefit
test, as set forth by the Supreme Court
precedents. I am troubled that an un-
clear phrasing such as ‘‘relating to the
market’’ is overbroad and will allow
judges and prosecutors to expand the
law.
I am also concerned that the bill, as
drafted, lacks an exclusivity provision
that would make this bill the exclusive
law of the land.
Finally, the rule of construction sec-
tion before us is troubling, because the
Financial Services Committee has not
even had a chance to debate this spe-
cific language. I fear that this language
could add more confusion and uncer-
tainty around insider trading laws,
with rogue judges and prosecutors
using the language to expand the
bounds of insider trading law.
I do believe that the ranking mem-
ber’s amendment goes a distance in
clarifying that, but, as I will talk
about, I will be having an amendment
later on as well that I believe further
clarifies that.
b 1330
Drafting a statute that appropriately
and accurately captures the subtleties
of insider trading case law and regula-
tions that have been shaped and
finessed over decades into one single
statute isn’t easy, to say the least.
Achieving bipartisan support also
isn’t easy, especially when it involves
nuanced and technical substance such
as the body of insider trading law.
My colleague, Ranking Member
MCHENRY, will be offering his amend-
ment momentarily that represents a
bipartisan agreement with the author
to improve the bill by including some
Republican priorities and improving
the bill to better track current insider
trading law.
As I had mentioned, I will be offering
an amendment as well in an attempt to
further clarify and improve this pro-
posal.
So, while we are unsure exactly what
the final product is going to look like
here, I do want to commend both Mr.
HIMES and Ranking Member MCHENRY
for working together to attempt to
reach a bipartisan agreement to im-
prove this bill with the amendment and
to make it clear that it is Congress’ in-
tent to codify existing law without
broadening it into new areas. I hope
that the author of the legislation will
accept my amendment as well.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Chair, I yield
such time as he may consume to the
gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.
HIMES), the chair of the Strategic
Technologies and Advanced Research
Subcommittee of the Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence, and a val-
ued member of the Financial Services
Committee.
Mr. HIMES. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding.
I rise, delighted today by our consid-
eration of H.R. 2534, the Insider Trad-
ing Prohibition Act, because, after
years of work, we are going to produce
a bipartisan product which actually
does address a significant challenge in
insider trading law, and that is, in gen-
eral, that, to date, there has existed,
remarkably, no specific statutory pro-
hibition on insider trading.
I am a believer, as I know everyone
else in this Chamber is, that, if we are
going to create criminal or civil liabil-
ity, the legislators of the Congress of
the United States should make specific
how and when and under what cir-
cumstances we do so. And that is what
we are doing today, I am delighted to
report, in bipartisan fashion.
But let me back up for a second, for
those who don’t sit on the committee
or watch this particular space all that
closely, just to explain why this is im-
portant.
Insider trading is an activity in
which somebody who has information
that they have been entrusted with, or
for which they have paid or come by in
some dishonest fashion, uses it to se-
cure a market advantage. They have
information that others don’t. They
trade on that information. That allows
them to get a material gain.
There is a problem with that, quite
apart from the notion that it is only
insiders or those people who are not
acting based on their talent or their in-
telligence or their hard work, but act-
ing based on who they know or, worse
yet, who they might have paid, that
they are the ones who benefit from our
capital markets. I think that notion
sort of strikes at the fundamental
sense of fairness that we all carry
around.
But, inasmuch as this behavior ex-
ists, it is profoundly damaging to the
capital markets that are such a hall-
mark of the United States, and it is
damaging because those capital mar-
kets rely on the confidence that mil-
lions of American families have out
there that their hard-earned savings
can be put into the market, invested,
and redeployed in a way that is fair to
them, that will create a return, and
that they are doing so on a level play-
ing field, not competing with people
who may have an inside advantage.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9273
December 5, 2019
Now, the good news here is that, in
the generations preceding us, we have,
in fact, prosecuted insider trading, but
we have done so under antifraud provi-
sions of the Securities Acts that were
passed in the early 1930s; and, as a re-
sult, there is not a particularly good fit
between the concept of fraud and the
concept of insider trading.
And to my friend Mr. HUIZENGA’s
point, as he knows, this has led to a
vast body of court-determined law,
starting with the Dirks decision in
1984, moving through Materia, Car-
penter, O’Hagan, all court decisions
which crafted the concept of liability
around insider trading, culminating in
the 2014 Newman decision by the Sec-
ond Circuit, leading then to the
Salman decision at the Supreme Court
in 2016.
All of these cases that I have men-
tioned have created uncertainty about
the nature of liability and have re-
sulted in overturned convictions of
people who behaved in ways that would
violate our intuitive sense of right and
wrong.
So, because of this uncertainty, be-
cause of the overturning of convic-
tions, now is the moment for us to fi-
nally do what we are here to do, which
is to make it very clear what the law of
the land is.
So the moment has come to pass this
legislation, and I am delighted to say it
comes after years of working with ex-
perts like the aforementioned Pro-
fessor John Coffee, past and present
Commissioners of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and consulta-
tion with prosecutors as well as with
defense attorneys.
This is a fairly fiddly and technical
area of the law, and so it was my inten-
tion, over the years, to make sure that
we crafted good law which created li-
ability for bad behavior but which did
not, in fact, create liability for behav-
ior like doing a little extra work to se-
cure an advantage in investments.
It was also very, very important to
me that this be done on a bipartisan
basis. There is really nothing partisan
about this bill. Neither party believes
in insider trading or wants to support
insider trading. This is not a question
of balancing regulation or allocating
public resources; this is a question of
clarity of law.
So I want to close, apart from just
saying that that has been the track
record of the establishment and writ-
ing of this legislation, by thanking
Ranking Member MCHENRY and Rank-
ing Member HUIZENGA.
There will be an amendment offered
by Ranking Member MCHENRY which
the Democrats support. It does improve
the bill. It is not really a compromise
in the sense that it actually makes for
a better bill.
But I am pleased to say that, after a
lot of hard work, this is, in fact, the
product of some very robust engage-
ment between the Democratic and Re-
publican Representatives in this Cham-
ber. That is not easy to achieve under
these circumstances.
So I want to start, first and foremost,
by thanking Chairwoman WATERS and
Chairwoman MALONEY for their spon-
sorship and then, again, Mr. MCHENRY
and Mr. HUIZENGA, who committed to
really understanding what is a tech-
nical corner of the law and offered, in
good faith, amendments, including
some ideas that we will shortly be tak-
ing up.
And then, finally, as every Member
in this Chamber knows, hard work hap-
pens and gets done and leads to success
only because of the commitment and
very, very hard work of the staff on
both sides of the aisle. So, before yield-
ing back my time to the chairwoman, I
do want to specifically thank Katelynn
Bradley, Ben Harney, David Fernandez,
and David Karp from the Financial
Services staff; Mark Snyder, my legis-
lative director, and Rachel Kelly, his
predecessor, from my staff.
And then, on the Republican side, big
thanks to Kimberly Betz, McArn Ben-
nett, and Jamie McGinnis.
Madam Chair, I urge passage of this
law. This will be a good thing for the
confidence in our capital markets. It
will be a good thing in reassuring the
American public that we can get things
done on a bipartisan basis. On that
basis, I urge passage of H.R. 2534, the
Insider Trading Prohibition Act.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Chair, I
yield such time as he may consume to
the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.
STEIL), the newest member of the In-
vestor Protection, Entrepreneurship,
and Capital Markets Subcommittee.
Mr. STEIL. Madam Chair, I thank
my colleague from Michigan. Our dis-
tricts touch in the middle of Lake
Michigan, so I have never been to that
part of my district, and maybe the gen-
tleman has not either, but I appreciate
him yielding.
I rise today to urge support of the In-
sider Trading Prohibition Act.
I want to thank Chairwoman
WATERS, Ranking Member MCHENRY,
as well as Mr. HUIZENGA and Mr. HIMES
for their work on this important piece
of legislation.
As we have seen far too often in this
Congress, partisanship and poison pills
can get in the way of progress and good
ideas. I think all of us, at our core,
agree on that. Although this took a lit-
tle bit of time, I am pleased that we
came here today reaching agreements
from earlier in the week.
I spent my time working for a period
of time at a publicly traded company. I
saw firsthand the importance of having
markets that operate efficiently but,
also, fairly.
Millions of Americans have retire-
ment accounts, 401(k)s, and pensions as
it relates to their retirement, and it is
critical that those individuals can rely
and trust the markets that they are re-
lying on for their end of life.
Millions of Americans are invested in
these markets and these investments,
the integrity of which is critical. They
need to know that we are fighting on
their behalf to ensure the game is not
rigged to help and favor a privileged
few.
This bill includes, in particular, im-
portant clarifications that will im-
prove our ability to police insider trad-
ing. It also incorporates changes sup-
ported by the ranking member in an
amendment that I offered that I think
provides important clarifications to
allow the government to go after the
bad guys.
This will ensure the bill is targeted
at bad behavior and does not inadvert-
ently prevent people from engaging in
legitimate trades. It strikes the bal-
ance that I think is crucial if we want
to have vibrant and trustworthy public
markets.
I, again, want to urge my colleagues
to support this nonpartisan legislation.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Chair, I
yield such time as he may consume to
the gentleman from North Carolina
(Mr. MCHENRY), the distinguished
ranking member.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I
thank the ranking member of the In-
vestor Protection, Entrepreneurship,
and Capital Markets Subcommittee,
Mr. HUIZENGA, for his good work in
committee and working on important
legislation for economic growth and for
his constituents in Michigan.
Madam Chair, preventing and pun-
ishing bad actors for illegal insider
trading is one of the top priorities of
Republicans on the House Financial
Services Committee because this ille-
gal activity hurts everyday Main
Street investors as well as the integ-
rity and the efficiency of our markets.
Trading on material insider informa-
tion in breach of a fiduciary duty is
currently prohibited by court-made law
under the antifraud provisions of the
Federal securities laws that we have.
The Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion and the Department of Justice
have the power to bring insider trading
cases, and both agencies regularly ex-
ercise this power and have done so for
decades.
Our body of insider trading laws has
been developed through those decades
of judicial precedent to protect inves-
tors and the markets by punishing bad
actors who illegally trade on insider in-
formation.
Codifying nuanced case law and regu-
lations that have been developed over
decades into a single statute is really
difficult. It is a very difficult under-
taking, and it is, really, a very delicate
piece of legislating that must occur.
Both Republicans and Democrats
who have served on the Securities and
Exchange Commission have expressed
concerns about Congress drafting a
statute that accurately captures this
extensive and expansive body of law
without expanding it into new areas,
inadvertently, perhaps, or perfectly by
design in some areas.
Moreover, bipartisanship is never
easy. It is a give-and-take. It is a dif-
ficult process. I appreciate the gen-
tleman from Connecticut (Mr. HIMES)

for his willingness to work with us in a
bipartisan manner.
The bill on the floor today is not per-
fect, and, as the gentleman from Con-
necticut knows, I have several con-
cerns with this bill.
I have concerns about the lack of an
explicit personal benefit test con-
sistent with Supreme Court precedent.
I am concerned that ambiguous lan-
guage currently in the bill, such as ‘‘re-
lating to the market,’’ is ripe for activ-
ist judges and overzealous prosecutors
and private plaintiffs to exploit, lead-
ing to greater uncertainty for anyone
involved in investing. That is not what
we want; that is not what we seek; and
that should not be this undertaking.
And I also don’t believe that that is the
intention of my colleague from Con-
necticut in the drafting of this bill.
I am also troubled that the Rules
Committee print before us does not in-
clude an exclusivity provision estab-
lishing that this bill is the insider trad-
ing law rather than just an additional
action around insider trading.
Finally, the Rules Committee print
includes a rule of construction section
that has yet to be vetted through the
Financial Services Committee; and
without a full understanding of the im-
plications of this language, the bill
could further open the door for activist
judges, overzealous prosecutors, and
trial lawyers, creating even more con-
fusion around insider trading law.
b 1345
That is not good for investors. That
is not good for our markets. It is not
good for anyone outside of a narrow
few that personally benefit through
fees around lawsuits.
My amendment, which I will offer in
a minute, addresses some of these con-
cerns, and I appreciate my colleague
from Connecticut, and I appreciate the
chair of the Financial Services Com-
mittee, Ms. WATERS, for their engage-
ment so that we can actually come to
a bipartisan agreement on this impor-
tant act.
Now, Republicans continue to sup-
port sensible bipartisan insider trading
bills, such as the one that Chairwoman
WATERS and I brought forth, or she
brought forth, as the first action of our
committee on this House floor in this
Congress, which was promoting Trans-
parent Standards for Corporate Insid-
ers Act, which we passed out of this
Chamber. And starting off with the
fact that we are going to be tough on
bad actors from the Financial Services
Committee and doing it in a bipartisan
way shows our seriousness. And this
bill before us is an addition to that se-
riousness that we take against bad ac-
tors in our area of jurisdiction.
Finally, I would say this: We cur-
rently have out of decades of lawsuits,
decades of regulatory enforcement, we
have the greatest clarity on insider
trading that we have ever had in this
Nation, and that is due to two Supreme
Court cases, in particular, giving us se-
rious rules of the road. And I think
that clarity is good. And what we want
out of this legislation is to put in stat-
ute what is confirmed and established
currently in the marketplace and cur-
rently in the courts of law.
This is not to create more confusion
or more lawsuits, but rather, codify
what is a well-regulated, bright-line
space that we currently have. And we
want to take that consistency that we
currently have and establish it in stat-
ute. And that is the reason why Repub-
licans have engaged deeply with Demo-
crats over the last 5 months to come to
some reasonable conclusion on this im-
portant matter of banning insider trad-
ing.
So Congress will have its say. I be-
lieve we will have a bipartisan vote for
final passage, if my amendment is
adopted, and I would hope that that
would take place. And we have had
good conversations along those lines,
and I think we have workable language
that could be acceptable to all in this
body.
I want to thank everyone who has
participated, but most particularly Mr.
HIMES from Connecticut. While we
don’t agree on every issue—heck, I
don’t think you would get reelected in
Connecticut if you agreed with me on
every issue, nor I in North Carolina in
my district—bipartisanship is a hard
thing, but if we are going to do big, im-
portant things, we have to try for that.
And when you are in the majority, it is
implicit you have more votes than
those in the minority.
So Democrats could pass this bill on
their own. They could. And if they
wanted to just use this as a political
issue, they could just jam the language
they have; they could, right? But it
was your willingness to reach out, so
that we could actually have a big bi-
partisan vote, rather than a narrow
victory. That is also something that is
a marker, that most in this country
don’t hear about, that we actually do
talk. We may disagree on big things,
we may, and from time to time Chair-
woman WATERS and I have had our pub-
lic disagreements, but at the same
time we have been able to come to
terms on important things in our juris-
diction and get things done.
So while that is not the everyday
case for this Congress, when it hap-
pens, I think we should actually ac-
knowledge it. Not that anybody is
going to pat us on the back for it, but
we should acknowledge it.
I thank my colleagues on the Demo-
crat side of the aisle for their work,
and I thank my colleagues on the Re-
publican side of the aisle for their
work, as well.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Chair, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
Madam Chair, I would like to take
this time to, again, congratulate the
work that has been done. I do believe
that there is additional work that is
before us.
I will be having an amendment that I
will be offering a little later on, and at
this point, I think, as it is coming to-
gether, there still is not going to be
total agreement or total unanimity.
You will see with the ranking mem-
ber’s amendment a number of Repub-
licans who will join this bill. I believe
that with the adoption of my amend-
ment you would see even further Re-
publican support of the underlying bill.
There will be some dissent. There is
dissent within the industry. There is
dissent within those prosecutors and
the regulators. As I had noted, both Re-
publican and Democrat chairs of the
SEC and commissioners of the SEC
have said that having Congress act on
this particular issue will set off a new
chain of events, a new set of legal chal-
lenges that will take years to settle in
the courts, as well, and they are com-
fortable with the options that they
have the way current law has settled.
Having said that, again, as the rank-
ing member had said, in an attempt to
codify a number of those Supreme
Court rulings is commendable. I tend
to be one who believes that Congress
has a responsibility to review and look
at and examine whether they should
codify precedent.
I find it interesting that on both
sides this happens and with the regu-
lators, and that everyone seems to pick
and choose a little bit as to what sub-
ject area they would like to codify and
what subject area they would continue
to like to have flexibility on, based on
those lawsuits.
At this time the ranking member and
his work with the gentleman from Con-
necticut has made significant progress,
and I look forward to adopting the gen-
tleman from North Carolina’s amend-
ment and the potential adoption of my
amendment, as well, as we move for-
ward.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. WATERS. Madam Chair, I yield
myself the remainder of my time.
Madam Chairwoman, H.R. 2534, the
Insider Trading Prohibition Act, is a
long overdue piece of legislation that
simply spells out the definition of ille-
gal insider trading under the securities
laws. It creates clarity for participants
in financial markets and empowers the
SEC to punish bad actors.
As we have discussed, this bill is sup-
ported by groups, including the Council
of Institutional Investors, the Cali-
fornia State Teachers’ Retirement Sys-
tem, the North American Securities
Administrators Association, Healthy
Markets, and Public Citizen.
Madam Chair, I thank the ranking
member, Mr. MCHENRY, for his very
kind comments. I thank him for his co-
operation. I thank him for recognizing
that it is possible to have bipartisan
legislation. And I thank him for recog-
nizing that Mr. HIMES has worked very
hard to ensure that he would have this
as bipartisan legislation, rather than
simply having the Democrats try to
run roughshod over the opposite side of
the aisle to get this done.
I urge all Members to vote ‘‘yes’’ on
this important bill. Madam Chair, I
yield back the balance of my time.

sonal benefit was paid or promised by or to any
person in the chain of communication, so long

AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR. MCHENRY
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 1 printed in
House Report 116–320.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate
the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 1, beginning on line 17, strike ‘‘relat-
ing to the market for’’ and insert ‘‘any non-
public information, from whatever source,
that has, or would reasonably be expected to
have, a material effect on the market price
of any’’.
Page 2, beginning on line 11, strike ‘‘relat-
ing to the market for’’ and insert ‘‘any non-
public information, from whatever source,
that has, or would reasonably be expected to
have, a material effect on the market price
of any’’.
Page 3, line 21, insert before the period the
following: ‘‘for a direct or indirect personal
benefit (including pecuniary gain,
reputational benefit, or a gift of confidential
information to a trading relative or friend)’’.
Page 5, strike lines 12 through 17 and insert
a closing quotation mark and a period.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 739, the gentleman from North
Carolina (Mr. MCHENRY) and a Member
opposed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from North Carolina.
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Chair, as I
just mentioned a few minutes ago, I
have concerns with H.R. 2534, the In-
sider Trading Prohibition Act in its
current form. And, Madam Chair, my
amendment addresses several of these
concerns and improves this bill to bet-
ter demonstrate congressional intent
of codifying current insider trading law
and not expanding it.
I thank the bill’s sponsor, the gen-
tleman from Connecticut (Mr. HIMES)
and his staff for their diligence and pa-
tience in working with us over the last
few months and over the recent
Thanksgiving holiday. I also want to
thank both of our staffs, as well as the
Waters’ staff. And I want to thank Mr.
HIMES for agreeing to support this
amendment in order to make this un-
derlying bill a bipartisan approach to
codify insider trading law and punish
bad actors.
My amendment reflects Republican
priorities discussed at our May mark-
up, such as the inclusion of an explicit
personal benefit test consistent with
Supreme Court precedent, the removal
of the novel rule of construction sec-
tion from the Rules print of this bill,
and a clarification of ambiguous words
to ensure judges and prosecutors know
that this bill is not intended to expand
or create new insider trading liability.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9276 December 5, 2019
The bill as drafted does not explicitly
include the so-called personal benefit
test, a significant element of insider
trading law that prosecutors must cur-
rently satisfy in certain insider trading
cases. In the 2016 Salman case, the Su-
preme Court noted that in order for a
violation to have occurred, the insider
or ‘‘tipper’’ providing the material,
nonpublic information must have re-
ceived a direct or indirect personal
benefit, including but not limited to,
pecuniary gain, reputational benefit, or
a gift of confidential information to a
trading relative or friend.
Including an explicit personal benefit
test, as set forth by the Supreme
Court, ensures that this important test
cannot be read more broadly by judges
than the Supreme Court has allowed,
and also, this prevents activist judges
and overzealous prosecutors from read-
ing the test out of law entirely.
My amendment also clarifies the am-
biguities within the ‘‘relating to the
market’’ phrasing in the underlying
bill. This phrase ‘‘relating to the mar-
ket’’ is not a legal term of art defined
within the existing body of insider
trading law, nor is it defined in this
bill. It is entirely plausible for an ac-
tivist judge or a rogue prosecutor to in-
terpret this phrase far more broadly
than the drafters of the bill intended.
This amendment provides a limiting
principle by applying only to nonpublic
information that has or is reasonably
expected to have a material effect on
the market price of a security. This en-
sures that the statute will still capture
cases where the receipt of material,
nonpublic information was not from
the company itself, but from another
source. This is referenced in the Su-
preme Court’s 1987 Carpenter decision.
Finally, my amendment strikes the
rule of construction section in the un-
derlying bill that was not reviewed or
debated in the House Financial Serv-
ices Committee. I believe this provi-
sion is, at best, unnecessary and at
worst, could have been read as giving a
congressional stamp of approval for a
poorly reasoned judicial set of deci-
sions.
b 1400
As such, my amendment would en-
sure that Congress’ intent is to simply
codify existing law, not expand liabil-
ity or create additional defenses for
those accused of insider trading. This
is about codifying what is already ex-
istent, period, end of statement.
That being said, my amendment does
not achieve all the Republican goals
that we have previously outlined in our
committee markup and committee
hearing. Unfortunately, the bill, even if
it is amended by this amendment, still
will not contain an exclusivity provi-
sion to make this the exclusive law of
the land for insider trading.
While my amendment does not make
this bill perfect, it does allow for Con-
gress to exercise its Article I authority
to produce a comprehensive insider
trading law for the first time and does
so in a bipartisan manner that simply
intends, we believe, to codify current
insider trading law without expanding
liability to good-faith people innocent
under the law.
Mr. Chair, I urge its adoption, and I
thank the bill’s sponsor for working
with us on it.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I claim the
time in opposition to the amendment,
even though I am not opposed to it.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. KENNEDY).
Without objection, the gentlewoman
from California is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
There was no objection.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
First, I thank Ranking Member
MCHENRY for offering this amendment
to H.R. 2534 to help further ensure that
this commonsense bill codifies the law
against insider trading in a fair man-
ner.
When we marked up the bill in com-
mittee in May, I understood that my
Republican colleagues had several con-
cerns with the bill but nevertheless
voiced their support in hopes of having
those concerns addressed before the bill
made its way to the House floor.
At the end of the day, those concerns
amounted to wanting additional clar-
ity that H.R. 2534 reflected the current
judge-made law against insider trading,
aside from the controversial 2014 ap-
peals court decision that has been sub-
ject to criticism from many sides.
After months of discussion with the
bill’s sponsor, Representative HIMES,
Ranking Member MCHENRY has crafted
this amendment to do just that. In par-
ticular, the amendment would clarify
that the existing law that requires the
SEC to establish some personal benefit
to a tipper in cases involving tipper
and tippee liability; clarify that the
material, nonpublic information that
forms the basis of liability may be re-
lated to either a specific security or to
any security if that information would
have or reasonably be expected to have
a material effect on the market price
of that security; and remove the rule of
construction to avoid confusion and
ambiguity and to ensure that this act
is not the exclusive means by which
the SEC, the Department of Justice, or
private litigants may pursue insider
trading.
If the amendment is accepted, I be-
lieve that the bill would provide the
SEC with clear additional authority to
bring to justice corporate insiders and
others who take unfair advantage of
confidential information. In addition,
because the bill uses the same terms
identified in the current case law
against insider trading, the SEC and
market participants can easily under-
stand what those terms mean.
Again, Mr. Chair, I thank Ranking
Member MCHENRY for strengthening
the bill, and I urge my colleagues to
join me in supporting this amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my
time to the gentleman from Con-
necticut (Mr. HIMES), the sponsor of
this important legislation.
Mr. HIMES. Mr. Chairman, what is
the balance of time available?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from California has 21⁄2 minutes re-
maining.
Mr. HIMES. Mr. Chairman, I thank
Ranking Member WATERS for yielding
me time.
I rise very briefly to welcome the
amendment by Mr. MCHENRY. Mr.
MCHENRY raised four substantive
points. Three of those points are incor-
porated in this amendment, which we
are very happy to accept.
I think it is, again, not a com-
promise, but an improvement of the
bill.
In my very little remaining time, we
did have discussions about exclusivity.
As the ranking member knows, the
idea here is to create a law under
which insider trading is prosecuted.
That is the objective.
As the ranking member knows, it is a
fairly complicated situation when in-
cluding specific exclusivity language.
Ultimately, that was not included in
the ranking member’s proposed amend-
ment here, but we should continue to
work together to make sure that this
is about clarifying and simplifying and
making more efficient rather than
making more complex.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I yield back
the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr.
MCHENRY).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MR. HUIZENGA
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 2 printed in
House Report 116–320.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 1, line 10, strike ‘‘AWARE OF’’ and in-
sert ‘‘USING’’.
Page 1, line 14, strike ‘‘aware of’’ and in-
sert ‘‘using’’.
Page 2, line 22, strike ‘‘aware of’’ and in-
sert ‘‘using’’.
Page 2, beginning on line 24, strike ‘‘aware
of’’ and insert ‘‘using’’.
Page 3, line 3, strike ‘‘aware of’’ and insert
‘‘using’’.
Page 3, line 23, strike ‘‘aware of’’ and in-
sert ‘‘using’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 739, the gentleman
from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Michigan.
Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, I will be brief. I am con-
cerned that the bill before us today fo-
cuses specifically on awareness of in-
formation rather than the use of
wrongful information in connection
with security trading.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9277
December 5, 2019
Specifically, this bill defines trading
while ‘‘aware’’ of material and non-
public information or communicating
material and nonpublic information as
wrongful only if the information was
obtained by way of, or its communica-
tion or use would constitute: theft,
bribery, misrepresentation, espionage;
a violation of Federal computer data
and intellectual property protection
and privacy laws; conversion, mis-
appropriation, or other deceptive
means; and any breach of a fiduciary
duty, a contractual relationship, a code
of conduct, or a personal confidence or
trust.
A person violates the bill’s prohibi-
tions on trading with and commu-
nicating material on nonpublic infor-
mation so long as this person ‘‘knew’’
the information was wrongfully ob-
tained, actively avoided gaining such
knowledge, or recklessly disregarded
the wrongful use, communication, or
obtainment of this information.
It does not matter, under the bill,
whether they know the method by
which the information was obtained or
communicated or if any benefit actu-
ally came from communication of the
information.
In short, Mr. Chair, I believe that
this would, in turn, allow activist
judges and prosecutors to go after indi-
viduals regardless of their intention or
actual profit from wrongful actions.
That is why my amendment is very
simple. It would strike all occurrences
of the phrase ‘‘aware of’’ and insert the
word ‘‘using.’’ In other words, you can
be aware of something, but if you are
not going to actually use that informa-
tion, why would you be held to a crimi-
nal standard?
My amendment would have the effect
of limiting who can be prosecuted
under this bill to people who actually
use wrongful information to gain a
profit.
As we all know, in our lives, there
are all kinds of rumors around us all
the time, whether it is about our work
life or our family or whatever might be
going on, somebody in the neighbor-
hood. It is hard to know what informa-
tion is actually true or actually accu-
rate.
What we have currently is this as-
sumption that being aware of some-
thing makes you criminally liable
versus actually using that information.
The current bill could allow prosecu-
tion of people who traded and are sim-
ply aware of information but perhaps
would have traded regardless of their
awareness of that information.
I am prepared to support this under-
lying bill with the adoption of my
amendment.
I was pleased to see the adoption of
the amendment from the gentleman
from North Carolina (Mr. MCHENRY). I
believe these are perfecting amend-
ments. I believe that these are issues
that need to be further addressed.
While I, too, have some concerns
about exclusivity and some of the
other things that the gentleman from
North Carolina (Mr. MCHENRY) dis-
cussed, I believe that this particular
issue is of significance, and it is suffi-
cient enough and significant enough to
pull my support across the finish line
as we move forward on this.
Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues
to accept this perfecting amendment,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I rise in op-
position to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from California is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I strongly
oppose Representative HUIZENGA’s
amendment that replaces the bill’s
standard of illegal insider trading
while ‘‘aware of’’ material, nonpublic
information with trading while
‘‘using’’ material, nonpublic informa-
tion.
This narrower standard is incon-
sistent with current law, would se-
verely weaken the bill, and would cre-
ate substantial enforcement hurdles to
the benefit of bad actors and to the
detriment of the SEC.
If the amendment is adopted, the
SEC would have to prove that the rea-
son the defendant traded was because
of a specific piece of information. That
means that the SEC would have a hard
time proving its case in court unless it
had an email from a defendant explain-
ing his motive for trading. Not many
bad actors engaging in illegal insider
trading are that dumb.
Moreover, such a change would ben-
efit insider traders at hedge funds or
other market intelligence firms be-
cause they would merely have to tell
the judge that they had other reasons
or data to support their trade.
The SEC’s existing rule 10b-5 clearly
states that the appropriate standard is
awareness. Changing it to ‘‘use,’’ as
Representative HUIZENGA’s amendment
would do, dramatically and substan-
tially weakens the SEC’s authority to
prosecute insider trading.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to re-
ject the amendment offered by Mr.
HUIZENGA.
Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my
time to the gentleman from Con-
necticut (Mr. HIMES), the sponsor of
this important legislation.
Mr. HIMES. Mr. Chairman, I thank
Chairwoman WATERS for yielding me
the time.
I rise in reluctant opposition to this
amendment because it has been a hall-
mark of this process that I very much
enjoyed working with Mr. MCHENRY
and Mr. HUIZENGA. The reason I rise in
opposition is really twofold or three-
fold.
Number one, as Mr. HUIZENGA may
recall, the original draft of the bill
would make it prosecutable to pros-
ecute somebody who is in possession of
material, nonpublic information. My
Republican friends correctly pointed
out that we are often in possession of
information that we may not be aware
of. Certainly, if you were to take a
look at my email inbox, you would
know that to be true. So at the sugges-
tion of the Republicans, we changed
the standard from ‘‘in possession’’ to
‘‘aware of.’’
While I know that Mr. HUIZENGA is
acting in good faith, Chairwoman
WATERS got it exactly right. If we go to
a use standard, it would require pros-
ecutors to actually get inside the moti-
vation of why somebody made a trade.
They would have to prove that you
made this trade because you had inside
information.
In support of Mr. HUIZENGA’s good
faith, I understand where he is coming
from, but let’s also face that the con-
fluence of circumstances where you
have material, nonpublic information
and you were going to do that trade at
precisely that moment is a very, very
rare event.
While I understand where Mr.
HUIZENGA is coming from, what I would
suggest is, instead of creating probably
an impossible prosecutorial burden,
let’s acknowledge that if in that very
rare event where you want to make a
trade and you happen to be in posses-
sion of material, nonpublic informa-
tion, let that trade go by. That is rare
enough that it shouldn’t in any way, I
think, speaking as somebody who has
spent time in this industry, com-
promise the effectiveness or the effi-
ciency of our capital markets.
Again, reluctantly, I stand in opposi-
tion to Mr. HUIZENGA’s amendment. I
hope he will nonetheless support the
underlying bill.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chair, I yield back
the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.

COMMEMORATING THE 75TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF PEACEFUL ZION
BAPTIST CHURCH
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate one of my dis-
trict’s most venerable churches. This
year marks the 75th anniversary of the
Peaceful Zion Baptist Church in East
Orange, New Jersey.
It has been known as a sanctuary for
those in need throughout that time. It
runs a food pantry for those in need of
a meal. It provides clothing for those
who could use a warm coat or socks.
The community of Peaceful Zion is
so strong that members have been
known to bring food to ailing families.
One of its members said: ‘‘Everyone is
there for one another.’’
Congratulations to Peaceful Zion
Baptist Church on its 75th anniversary.
They are a blessed beacon of loving
care in my 10th District in New Jersey.

YESTERDAY’S IMPEACHMENT
HOAX
(Mr. RUTHERFORD asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker,
this morning, Speaker PELOSI an-
nounced that yesterday’s hearing in
the Judiciary Committee will, with
‘‘leading American constitutional
scholars,’’ give Congress no choice—no
choice—but to impeach the President.
But let’s take a look at who exactly
testified at yesterday’s impeachment
hoax.
Professor Karlan donated over $12,000
to liberal Democrat politicians, went
after the President’s 13-year-old son,
and she can’t even walk past the
Trump Hotel without having to cross
the street.
Professor Gerhardt donated thou-
sands of dollars to former President
Obama and Hillary Clinton. He also
worked against Justice Kavanaugh
during his nomination process.
Professor Feldman called for the
President’s impeachment in 2017 based
on a tweet, just over a month into his
Presidency.
However, Professor Turley, who
voted against the President, had this
to say about the lack of evidence
against President Trump: ‘‘Impeach-
ments have to be based on proof, not
presumptions.’’
Abuse of power? Madam Speaker, an
impeachment with this fact pattern is
an abuse of power by the House of Rep-
resentatives.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9281

for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
we do have a very solemn responsi-
bility to uphold the rule of law, but it
is important to note that Democrats
and the majority in the House have
worked every day for the American
people.
Among the 400 bills that we have sup-
ported are: H.R. 986, the Protecting
Americans with Preexisting Conditions
Act of 2019, legislation that I have con-
sistently worked on for almost a dec-
ade; the Equality Act, which gives
equality to all people; the Paycheck
Fairness Act, to treat women fairly;
the Climate Action Now Act and other
legislation to recognize the crisis in
climate change; national flood insur-
ance, which my constituents in Texas
are desperate for; directing the re-
moval of United States Armed Forces
from hostilities in the Republic of
Yemen; and then, of course, a signature
bill that I have written over a 2-year
period, the Violence Against Women
Reauthorization Act, which expands
the rights of Native Americans and
provides $291 million for our law en-
forcement and prosecutors.
Finally, let me say, I was very proud
to stand for H. Res. 183, condemning
anti-Semitism as hateful expressions of
intolerance, which are contradictory to
the values and aspirations that define
the people of the United States, and
condemning anti-Muslim discrimina-
tion and bigotry against minorities as
hateful expressions of intolerance.
We have been working on behalf of
the American people. We ask the other
body to work, but we are doing our job
for the goodness and the greatness of
this Nation.
f
PENNSYLVANIA’S 12TH CONGRES-
SIONAL DISTRICT’S ENERGY
ECONOMY IS BOOMING
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, the
energy economy of Pennsylvania’s 12th
Congressional District is booming, cre-
ating good-paying jobs and providing
low-cost energy to thousands of fami-
lies across the Commonwealth and our
Nation.
As evidence of this, our district is
happy to welcome Thailand-based nat-
ural gas company BKV to Pennsylva-
nia’s 12th Congressional District. Next
week, BKV will be opening an office in
Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania. They will
join other natural gas companies in
Pennsylvania’s 12th Congressional Dis-
trict that are creating jobs, giving
back to the community, and helping
our rural district thrive with the re-
sources right under our feet.
Pennsylvania’s 12th Congressional
District plays an important role in our
national energy portfolio, producing
between one-tenth and one-twentieth
of the country’s entire natural gas sup-
ply on any given day.
Energy produced in PA–12 lowers en-
ergy costs, creates an energy-inde-
pendent United States, and allows our
allies to no longer be reliant on energy
resources from countries that do not
share our values.
Natural gas companies have helped
with community revitalization and in
creating a robust economy of down-
stream jobs. The present and future of
PA–12 is bright because of the natural
gas industry, and, for the benefit of my
community, our State, and our Nation,
I will continue to support its growth
and expansion in Congress.
f
STOP ROBOCALLS
(Mr. LIPINSKI asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker,
robocalls, just mentioning them is
enough to make anyone’s blood boil.
Robocalls interrupt our time with
family and friends, scam people out of
their hard-earned money while spoof-
ing numbers to make calls look local,
and even clog up the phone lines of hos-
pital emergency rooms. In 2018, Ameri-
cans, collectively, received 48 billion
robocalls.
I cosponsored legislation earlier this
year to stop robocalls, and the House
voted yesterday to pass the final
version, which we expect to be signed
into law.
The TRACED Act strengthens pen-
alties and extends the statute of limi-
tations on violations; it requires phone
companies to authenticate where calls
are coming from and help customers
easily block them at no extra charge;
and it requires continued work by the
Federal Government to combat emerg-
ing robocall methods.
This is a clear win for the American
people and shows what we can do here
when we work together.
f
VIRGINIA SUPPORTS THE SECOND
AMENDMENT
(Mr. RIGGLEMAN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Madam Speaker,
40 Virginia localities have declared
themselves ‘‘Second Amendment sanc-
tuaries,’’ resolving to support the Con-
stitution and stand against infringe-
ments on the Second Amendment.
Across my district, thousands of citi-
zens are rallying outside the meetings
of their local government to show their
strong support for the rights of gun
owners.
Virginia has always been a cradle of
constitutional rights. There is no di-
vide between our rural and urban popu-
lations. All of us want to defend our
rights as citizens of the United States
of America.
I represent the same district that
James Madison represented in the first
Congress. He understood America’s
rights to bear arms when he wrote it
into our Constitution.
I am a strong supporter of the Second
Amendment, and I am proud to stand
with the people who are speaking up
for their constitutional rights and for
the Commonwealth of Virginia.
James Madison would be proud. I
know I am.
f
12 DAYS OF SALT
(Ms. SHERRILL asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, on
the second day of SALT, my constitu-
ents have said to me that they send
more money to Washington and get
back less than almost any other State
in the country. The SALT cap com-
pounds the attack on New Jersey, forc-
ing our residents to send even more
money to Washington without a return
on that investment.
For every dollar New Jersey sent to
Washington in 2017, we got back only 82
cents. That puts us in 49th place, al-
most dead last in State return on Fed-
eral tax dollars. And this was before
the Federal Government stripped the
full SALT deduction.
Meanwhile, States like Kentucky got
back $2.35 for every dollar they sent to
Washington. That is nearly three times
what New Jersey gets.
The 2017 tax bill unfairly targets
States like mine that pay more than
their fair share. We fund projects in
Kentucky and do not see that same in-
vestment, say, on things like infra-
structure, for example, in our State.
We need to restore the SALT deduc-
tion cap and keep money in the pock-
ets of New Jerseyans so we can con-
tinue to power the Nation’s economy.
f
CONGRATULATING SANGAMON
COUNTY’S WILLIAMSVILLE HIGH
SCHOOL
(Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Sangamon Coun-
ty’s Williamsville High School, who,
last week, won the Class 3A Illinois
State football championship, the
school’s first ever.
On Friday night at Huskie Stadium
in DeKalb, Illinois, the Williamsville
Bullets rallied late in the fourth quar-
ter to win a thrilling 46–42 game
against Byron High School. With just 3
minutes remaining and Byron leading
42–39, the Williamsville defense
stonewalled Byron to force a turnover.
The Bullets then marched down the
field, and junior quarterback Conor
McCormick fired a game-winning
touchdown to secure the State title.
The Bullets’ offense set a 3A cham-
pionship record with 550 yards of total
offense. Wide receiver Brandon Bishop
set a record for receiving yards with

The Williamsville football team has
made all of central Illinois proud with
their accomplishments this season. The
never-give-up spirit that embodied this
team was on full display in their State
championship, and their historic sea-
son is a testament to the hard work of
these young men.
I congratulate Coach Aaron Kunz and
the Williamsville High School Bullets.

commissioned U.S. Coast Guard cutter
Angela McShan. The ship is part of a
new fleet of cutters that boasts short
response times and larger vessels,
which will help patrol the coast from
south Jersey all the way down to the
Caribbean.
This cutter was named after the late
Master Chief Angela McShan, who
served the Coast Guard for over 20
years, and she was the first Black
woman to earn the title of master chief
petty officer.
The cutter was commissioned with
the help of McShan’s seven brothers
and sisters in boarding the cutter for
the first time and raising the flag so
the ship could set sail.
I am excited to see the U.S. Coast
Guard Training Center Cape May flour-
ish with the upgrade of the new cutter,
and I am honored to have a hero like
Angela McShan watching over our offi-
cers from heaven.
Madam Speaker, we are proud of An-
gela McShan. We are proud of the
Coast Guard, both in the United States
of America and in south Jersey.

REMEMBERING PEARL HARBOR
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the lives of those who
fought and those who died so valiantly
during the attacks at Pearl Harbor. On
December 7, 78 years ago, the unthink-
able happened. Our Nation was at-
tacked in one of the most horrific
events we have ever endured on our
own soil. That day that will live in in-
famy also compelled the United States
to enter the second World War.
The bombs that destroyed the USS
Arizona, 169 aircraft, and most of our
Pacific fleet, rocked the Nation to its
core. The attack killed almost 2,500
servicemembers plus 49 civilians and
wounded 1,200 more. They were sons
and daughters, they were brothers and
sisters, and above all, they were he-
roes.
And today we stand with those who
lost family and friends, and we stand
with the heroes who have defended and
those who continue to defend our free-
doms today and our way of life. We
must never forget, and we must always
honor their sacrifice.

DEMOCRATS HAVE PLEDGED TO
TAKE ACTION
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, in
January, House Democrats pledged to
get to work for the people and take ac-
tion to uplift the lives of everyday
Americans.
I am so proud of the progress we have
made and the proposals we have ad-
vanced that would have real, meaning-
ful impacts on our communities. Unfor-
tunately, our partners in the United
States Senate have abdicated their re-
sponsibility to do the same.
We have sent over 300 bipartisan bills
to the Senate so far this year, and not
one has been taken up for a vote. This
includes legislation to keep our com-
munities safer by enacting universal
background checks on all gun sales,
legislation that would raise the min-
imum wage, safeguard our elections,
protect people with preexisting condi-
tions, and ensure equal pay for equal
work.
We were elected to serve the Amer-
ican people, and I will keep fighting
alongside my colleagues in the House
to advance legislation that improves
the lives of everyone who calls our Na-
tion home. I call upon the United
States Senate to do the very same.
f
THE RIGHT TO VOTE IS SACRED
(Mr. ENGEL asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise
in support of H.R. 4, the Voting Rights
Advancement Act.
The right to vote is sacred and must
not be infringed upon. Sadly, our Na-
tion has a long and even bloody history
of racial voter suppression, but lately
that suppression has been supercharged
by the terrible decision in Shelby
County v. Holder. This case gutted key
protections of the Voting Rights Act,
allowing for States to prevent certain
groups from accessing the ballot
through voter ID laws, closing polling
locations, and even purging voter rolls.
I will be pleased to vote in favor of
H.R. 4, as it represents a major step to-
ward ensuring every citizen has the
ability to vote. H.R. 4 will create a new
coverage formula for repeated voting
rights violations in the last 25 years
and establish practice-based
preclearance to focus administrative or
judiciary review narrowly on suspect
voting practices.
With the House approving H.R. 4, we
take a major step forward, and I urge
prompt action by the other body.
PEACE PROCESS IN UKRAINE
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, next
week, leaders from Ukraine, France,
Germany, and Russia will meet to dis-
cuss a road forward to peace in
Ukraine. President Zelensky was elect-
ed with a clear mandate to bring to an
end Russia’s illegal war on Ukraine.
The question we must ask is: Peace
at what cost to liberty?
Russia illegally invaded Ukraine, al-
ready leading to the deaths of over
14,000 Ukrainians and the displacement
of millions. The enemy of liberty seeks
to undermine democratic institutions
that have secured peace in Europe
since the second World War ended.
During these sensitive negotiations,
freedom lovers stand shoulder to shoul-
der with the Ukrainian people. Amer-
ica will not tolerate any nation that
bullies Ukraine into a sham peace that
only rewards Kremlin aggression.
We join with the Ukrainian people in
welcoming a just peace in Ukraine.
However, any peace agreement cannot
provide legal cover for Russia’s land
grab. Peace can only come to Europe
when Russia respects the integrity of
Ukraine’s borders.
Madam Speaker, liberty on the Euro-
pean Continent hangs in the balance.
Today we must do what is right and
stand with Ukraine’s people so that to-
morrow she will have a lasting peace
and Europe, as well.

CONGRATULATING THE RIVER
ROUGE FOOTBALL TEAM
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to give a hearty congratulations
to our Panthers, the River Rouge High
School football team on winning their
first ever state championship. Thir-
teenth District strong is so incredibly
proud.
In a dramatic game, our River Rouge
Panthers prevailed over setbacks early
on to defeat a formidable opponent.
This hard-earned victory is a testa-
ment to the countless hours of training
put in by this dedicated team, as well
as the support of its coaches and our
parents.
As legendary basketball coach Phil
Jackson once said, ‘‘The strength of
the team is each individual member.
The strength of each member is the
team.’’
Please join me in recognizing our
River Rouge High School football
team, the Panthers, and Coach Corey
Parker for their outstanding accom-
plishment.
Congratulations, Panthers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9283
December 5, 2019
gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms.
TLAIB) is recognized for 60 minutes as
the designee of the majority leader.
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, today, I
am representing the Congressional Pro-
gressive Caucus in our Special Order so
that we can push forward on a number
of agendas, especially on economic jus-
tice issues. I am really proud to join
many of my colleagues today as we
talk about housing for all across the
United States of America.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. OMAR).
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to discuss the basic and dire
human right that so many of us take
for granted, the right to a safe and sta-
ble home.
Last week, families across this coun-
try gathered around in their dining
rooms to give thanks and break bread,
but many families in my home district
were not sitting around for a holiday
dinner. Instead, they were facing an in-
describable tragedy. The day before
Thanksgiving, a fire broke out in a 25-
story public housing building in the
Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Min-
neapolis where I grew up. Five people
lost their lives. And more than a week
later residents are still in the hospital
recovering from their injuries.
After the brave men and women of
the local fire department cleared the
scene and controlled the blaze, we dis-
covered an almost unbelievable reality.
These homes were not equipped with
sprinklers. You see, these buildings are
so old that it is exempt from laws that
require such lifesaving equipment.
And that isn’t the only egregious
safety issue that our public housing
residents are forced to endure.
There has been a ban on building new
public housing since the 1990s. In fact,
the Cedar-Riverside building that sus-
tained the fire was built in the 1960s.
And the Federal Government has been
underfunding the repair and mainte-
nance needs of the homes for years. In
Minnesota, the backlog of repair needs
totals over $300 million. So not only
are these homes half a century old,
they are practically being held to-
gether with little more than hope and
masking tape.
Make no mistake, we, as lawmakers,
bear responsibility for the deplorable
conditions of our public housing and
for the deplorable and unsafe condi-
tions that millions of Americans are
living in today. This is our fault. The
Federal Government has all but aban-
doned public housing.
We cannot continue to pretend that
we can’t see the crumbling buildings in
our districts. We can’t continue to ig-
nore the hundreds of thousands who ex-
perience homelessness because of wait-
ing lists for housing assistance. And it
goes beyond the homeless population.
Millions of Americans are living
every single day in fear of eviction.
Twelve million Americans are paying
more than half of their income in rent,
and about 6,300 people are evicted every
single day.
How can we in Congress call our-
selves leaders if we continue to ignore
this crisis?
I, for one, refuse to continue down
that path. It is time for a bold and pro-
gressive solution.
I will be introducing legislation that
ensures every public housing unit in
this country is equipped with sprin-
klers, so that we never see another dev-
astating tragedy like the one that be-
fell the residents of my district. And
we will be demanding accountability
from HUD, requiring the agency to re-
port on exactly how many units are not
fitted with sprinklers and how much
money the agency needs to fix this
glaring hazard. But that is not enough.
Last month I introduced Homes for
All Act, which would make an historic
investment of $1 trillion in public hous-
ing and low-income housing and build a
record 12 million new homes over the
next 10 years.
My bill would also ensure that public
housing residents are guaranteed ac-
cess to important wraparound services
like employment assistance, child care,
and financial literacy courses.
And just as important, my bill would
make sure that public housing funding
is a mandatory part of our Federal
budget, meaning that the government
wouldn’t be able to abandon these new
homes or neglect their upkeep. Public
housing would now be treated like any
other important guaranteed source of
assistance, like Social Security and
Medicare.
While my legislation is bold, it is
also absolutely necessary. Every
human being has a right to a safe and
affordable home. And without an his-
toric investment in our public housing
stock and greater accountability for
the safety of our residents, we will con-
tinue to face tragedies like the ones
that claimed the lives of five people in
Cedar-Riverside last week. We cannot
let that happen, and I will not let that
happen.
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
woman RASHIDA TLAIB for allowing this
conversation to take place today.
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentleman from California (Mr.
GOMEZ).
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I
thank the Congresswoman from Michi-
gan for having this Special Order on
such an important issue.
When you look at inequality in
America, you have to start with hous-
ing, because inequality often is started
by how much a person pays to house
their family, to house their kids, to
house their family members.
In order to solve for inequality, we
have to solve the housing crisis. And in
order to solve the housing crisis, we
have to acknowledge and rectify Amer-
ica’s shameful history of discrimina-
tory housing practices.
Policies and practices like redlining,
segregation, blockbusting, and steering
that denied low-income people and
communities of color access to home-
ownership and created the housing dis-
parities that are still prevalent today.
b 1545
In America, homeownership is how
we build wealth, and it determines
your family’s likelihood of success.
In America, whether you rent or you
own, where you live determines where
your kids go to school.
In America, it often determines how
far you commute to work.
In America, it often determines how
far you are from a grocery store and
healthy options for food for your fam-
ily. It also determines what public
services are available to you.
But, unfortunately, many low-in-
come individuals and people of color
have been denied this opportunity.
We still have an opportunity to make
amends and rectify the inequalities
that have persisted in low-income
neighborhoods and communities of
color.
The Tax Code is one of the most pow-
erful tools we have. That is why I re-
introduced the Rent Relief Act.
This bill aims to reduce the rent bur-
den by creating a new refundable tax
credit for families that are paying
more than 30 percent of their income in
rent and utilities because no family
should be forced to choose between
paying rent and meeting their basic
needs. This would put more money in
the pockets of families at a time when
wages have remained stagnant and
housing costs have increased.
This bill has the potential to trans-
form lives, provide millions of the low-
est income people with a breadth of op-
portunities, and provide opportunities
to climb the economic ladder by redis-
tributing the benefits of homeowner-
ship to the lowest income earners.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to cosponsor this important
piece of legislation.
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentlewoman from New York
(Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ), my good col-
league.
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Madam
Speaker, I thank Congresswoman
TLAIB for hosting this Special Order
hour on housing and our chair for pre-
siding during this very critical con-
versation.
We are here today to talk about one
of the most core, important issues fac-
ing the American people, which is
housing.
Each and every year, it feels as
though, as our wages remain stable or
the same, rent is going up, and it be-
comes harder and harder to afford the
very things that keep ourselves afloat
and alive, whether it is healthcare,
housing, or an education.
During the financial crisis of 2008,
American households lost $16 trillion
in wealth. Many lost their homes and
saw their savings and retirement funds
depleted. More than half of all renters
in America, over 21 million households,
were rent-burdened in 2015, meaning
that they spent 30 percent or more of
their income on rent.
We are in one of the worst renter cri-
ses in a generation. At a time when our

H9284 December 5, 2019
country is at its wealthiest, in the city
of New York, we are seeing populations
of people who are homeless at the high-
est rates since the Great Depression.
But there is another way.
When we start to legislate housing as
a human right, we begin to change our
priorities and move away from looking
at housing as a for-profit commodity
for speculation and toward something
that should be guaranteed for all
Americans at an affordable rate that
can be accessible to all working people
in America.
That is one of the reasons why I have
introduced A Place to Prosper Act,
which includes provisions like uni-
versal rent control, just cause evic-
tions, a ban on income discrimination,
access to counsel, improving the qual-
ity of the housing stock, and a disclo-
sures requirement on corporate land-
lords to rein in bad actors.
Additionally, we also know that the
area of housing and construction is one
of the largest contributors to carbon
emissions, which is why we have also
introduced the Green New Deal for
Public Housing Act. What that does is
that it works and aims to decarbonize
the entire public housing stock in the
United States of America.
It is what must be done; it is in ac-
cordance with the science; and it
changes the value system through
which we approach housing away from
the volatile boom-and-bust speculative
environment and toward a secure and
stable economic environment that
treats housing as a right.
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.
BLUMENAUER), my good colleague.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker,
I appreciate the gentlewoman’s cour-
tesy in permitting me to speak on this
and for organizing what I think is one
of the most important discussions that
this Congress needs to have.
Housing is fundamental. It has been
the major source of wealth generation
for millions of middle-class Americans
and an even greater source of wealth
accumulation for upper income Ameri-
cans.
But, sadly, it has been a source of
discrimination and widening income
inequality because of decades of sys-
tematic discrimination by the Federal
Government against people of color, es-
pecially African Americans.
I am embarrassed that in my commu-
nity, returning World War II veterans
were denied opportunities to live in
neighborhoods where they could actu-
ally afford the loans. The redlining
practices denied them an opportunity
to be able to secure government-fi-
nanced lending.
We had practices in the real estate
industry that actively steered people
away from certain neighborhoods. We
had areas where people resisted allow-
ing people of color to move in. The
Federal Government did not enforce
constitutional antidiscrimination pro-
visions.
Madam Speaker, the consequences of
decades of neglect, discrimination, and
underinvestment is visible today in
most major American cities. It is obvi-
ous in my community, where we are
seeing a homeless population that is
persistent and growing.
We are seeing in communities large
and small people who are rent-bur-
dened, as my colleagues have already
referenced, with half the people paying
more than a third of their income,
many of them over half, if they can
qualify as renters at all.
The Federal Government has system-
atically reduced its modest housing
footprint, not being involved in new
housing construction for low-income
and extremely low-income people.
There is no way, despite Ben Carson’s
mumbo jumbo, that those people can
be self-sufficient, in terms of housing.
They need direct government assist-
ance.
The failure to have adequately
housed them plays out in our streets.
Inadequate housing has health con-
sequences. In fact, we are watching
now some of America’s hospital sys-
tems realizing that fact and investing
in housing opportunities and wrap-
around services because people who are
not adequately housed actually cost so-
ciety far more.
We are watching steps that are being
taken in the private sector to recognize
that this is the quickest way to close
that income inequality gap. It is the
quickest way to strengthen commu-
nities. In fact, it has profound con-
sequences for education.
Children who are housed not in con-
centrated poverty but in housing op-
portunities that integrate them into
broader communities have much better
performance in schools without in-
creasing the number of teachers, with-
out increasing the per capita spending
per pupil. Where those children live is
the most profound indicator of future
academic success.
I have been troubled with this issue
for years. This summer, I spent time
developing a report on why the Federal
Government needs to get back into the
housing game. It is entitled ‘‘Locked
Out: Reversing Federal Housing Fail-
ures and Unlocking Opportunity.’’ It is
available on my website.
Madam Speaker, I am deeply con-
cerned that we finally recognize hous-
ing is a fundamental right. The United
Nations recognized it as a fundamental
human right in 1948, and we are a long
way from that point.
We need to invest in reducing the
shortage of 7 million affordable rental
homes available to extremely low-in-
come people. No State has an adequate
supply of affordable homes.
I propose building 12 million new
public housing units and fully funding
all the maintenance need in the exist-
ing public housing stock rather than
slowly starving the authorities in their
ability to maintain an adequate hous-
ing stock.
I think it is past time to create a
renter’s tax credit to cover the dif-
ference between the rent and wages or
making Section 8 vouchers an entitle-
ment program available for all who
qualify.
Yes, it will be expensive, but we are
already spending huge amounts of
money subsidizing housing. The prob-
lem is that the subsidies go to people
who need the help the least. The mort-
gage interest deduction provides most
of the support for people at the upper
income levels, people who already have
housing. In countries around the world
that don’t even have a mortgage inter-
est deduction, there is no great vari-
ation in homeownership rates.
We can adjust that now. There is an
opportunity for us, and I have proposed
equalizing the benefit of the mortgage
interest deduction by converting it
into a credit so that it treats people at
various income levels equally.
I also think it is past time to elimi-
nate a mortgage interest deduction for
second homes and, instead, invest that
money in helping people who don’t
have housing today.
It may seem to some that these are
ambitious proposals, but I would sug-
gest that the cost of past discrimina-
tion, the cost of inaction, costs us far
more in terms of wasted human poten-
tial, increased law enforcement, in-
creased health costs, and poor aca-
demic performance.
Madam Speaker, I deeply appreciate
my colleagues coming forward with
this discussion and working together
on provisions that can make a dif-
ference.
We just had the Republicans pass the
largest transfer of wealth in America’s
history, adding $2 trillion to our na-
tional debt and doing nothing to deal
with the housing crisis. In fact, it cre-
ated housing burdens in States by wip-
ing out the deduction for State and
local income taxes, for instance.
I think it is time for us to stop pay-
ing for failure, to reassess our policies,
to reverse decades of past discrimina-
tion, and to do things that will make a
difference for American families.
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentleman from Pennsylvania
(Mr. EVANS), my good colleague.
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman, my colleague from
the great city of Detroit and from
Michigan, for showing this leadership.
‘‘None of us are home until all of us
are home.’’ This is the slogan of
Project HOME, an organization in my
district that empowers individuals to
break the cycle of poverty and home-
lessness, starting with permanent sup-
portive housing.
Safe, affordable housing is the basis
of stability and well-being. Secure
housing improves health outcomes,
helps children perform better in school,
and can break generational cycles of
poverty. But given the skyrocketing
cost of rent, which is outpacing in-
comes, secure housing is out of reach
for many low-income families.
Lacking a fixed address makes it
harder to land a job, enroll children in
school, apply for assistance and bene-
fits.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9285
December 5, 2019
b 1600
The affordable housing shortage is a
crisis in my district and in many other
cities and neighborhoods across the Na-
tion.
I represent Philadelphia, a city which
has a poverty rate of around 25 percent.
Let me repeat that, a city with a pov-
erty rate of about 25 percent. Most low-
income renters spend at least half of
their income on housing. This leaves
no room for unexpected expenses such
as medical bills, which can quickly
send vulnerable families into housing
inability, eviction, and, sometimes,
homelessness.
We must increase funding for pro-
grams that help the most vulnerable,
including children, people with disabil-
ities, and seniors, such as homeless as-
sistance grants and the housing choice
voucher program.
Those living in poverty, including
400,000 in the city of Philadelphia, are
struggling to find safe and affordable
places to live. Over 40,000 families are
on the Philadelphia Housing Authority
waiting list—40,000 are on that list.
Most low-income renters in Philadel-
phia receive no government assistance
with their housing costs, driving many
to rely on alternative arrangements to
secure shelter.
These are steps that we can take to
address this growing crisis. We must
invest in preserving existing public
housing and improving health and safe-
ty through increased funding for the
Public Housing Operating Fund and the
Public Housing Capital Fund.
In the city of Philadelphia, the Phila-
delphia City Council recently passed a
right to counsel law, providing attor-
neys for low-income families facing
evictions.
But millions of Americans in other
cities and communities face evictions
every year. This lack of access to legal
representation has led to unjust evic-
tions. I am an original cosponsor of the
Eviction Protection Act, which creates
grants to provide legal representation
to those facing eviction.
It is not an accident that two Mem-
bers who stood up here are also mem-
bers of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee, as I am. We all recognize that
we can use the Tax Code to lift our
neighborhoods and boost our stability
in housing.
Yes, we can use the Tax Code. I am
happy that my colleagues are from the
Ways and Means Committee, and we
should work together on that.
I support the expansion of the low-in-
come housing tax credit—especially
the credits for securing extremely low-
income households—to bring capital to
underserved regions.
Access to affordable housing is a
right. It is time Congress acknowledges
that fact. All Americans deserve qual-
ity homes—all Americans. None of us
are home until all of us are home.
I want to stress that message: None
of us are home until all of us are home.
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman, again, from Detroit, Michigan,
for her leadership in bringing us to-
gether to talk about a subject that is
very key to a lot of our survival. It is
extremely essential that we have that
opportunity, but it starts with leader-
ship, and it starts today. We need to be
relentless on this subject, and we need
to be no nonsense.
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.
GARCÍA), my good colleague.
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, I thank Congresswoman
TLAIB for bringing up this subject of
the affordable housing shortage across
our country. I want to speak about the
affordable housing crisis that is unfold-
ing across this country and affecting
thousands of my constituents in the
city of Chicago.
Throughout the Chicago area, there
are just over 90,000 affordable, available
rental homes, but the National Low In-
come Housing Coalition estimates that
there are over 326,000 low-income
renter households. That is right. Less
than one in three households in Chi-
cago have access to affordable housing.
The immense lack of housing is mak-
ing it impossible for low-income com-
munities to stay in our city. It is
transforming my district, driving com-
munities of color away from areas
where they have lived for many, many
decades.
According to the Chicago Community
Trust, Chicago has lost more than
100,000 African American residents in
the past 10 years alone. The Logan
Square neighborhood in my district has
lost more than 20,000 Latino residents
and nearly 10,000 African Americans
over the past 15 years.
Five years ago, Chicago’s city coun-
cil passed an ordinance encouraging
transit-oriented development. I believe
that improving transportation and mo-
bility for our neighborhoods and tying
that to affordable housing is critically
important.
However, we know that development,
when done incorrectly, can lead to
gentrification, displacement, and ra-
cially inequitable outcomes. Since Chi-
cago’s ordinance passed, only one af-
fordable housing development has been
completed; another is getting off the
ground.
I am planning to introduce legisla-
tion to incentivize equitable transit-
oriented development, legislation to
create Federal funding for affordable
housing to be built near public transit
so workers can get to and from jobs,
school, and healthcare, as well as take
advantage of the city’s fine cultural
amenities.
This bill will be a crucial step in ad-
dressing the enormous problems we are
discussing today. If we can address the
topics raised by the many speakers
who are bringing home the urgency
that Congress needs to act in this field
of needed affordable housing, we can
become a better country.
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
woman TLAIB for taking the initiative
and for hosting this discussion that can
benefit our country.
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I yield
to the gentlewoman from Massachu-
setts (Ms. PRESSLEY), my good col-
league.
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I
thank Representative TLAIB for her
leadership on this and so many social
justice issues. I really appreciate her
organizing this Special Order hour, and
I hope that, in some ways, it assures
the American people that we have not
lost sight of them and that this Con-
gress continues to lead and to legislate
on those issues of care, concern, and
consequence to the American people. I
know this is the number one con-
stituent call that my district office re-
ceives, and I am certainly not alone in
that.
Housing First is not just an approach
to ending homelessness; it is a funda-
mental truth that should guide every-
thing we do in these Chambers. When
we speak of our priorities, when we
speak of the important work we hope
to do here, housing must come first.
Housing is the foundation of every-
thing, and, therefore, must be
foundational to everything that we
seek to accomplish here as a body.
Housing is a critical determinant of
health and wealth and must be the
foundation of our fight for greater jus-
tice for all.
I also would like to reiterate some of
the points made earlier regarding our
young people learning.
Earlier today, we heard from some
young people about many of the bar-
riers and obstacles to their readiness to
learn. Housing was chief amongst
them. As we see our families desta-
bilized by growing gentrification and
displacement and more families experi-
encing homelessness, this is certainly a
contributor and a barrier to their read-
iness to learn. It is traumatic to not
have a home.
I want to thank my sister in service,
Representative ILHAN OMAR, for pro-
viding us with a vision for the future of
housing: housing as a right; housing as
a guarantee; housing for all.
In cities across the country, includ-
ing those in my district, the housing
supply lacks both in quantity and qual-
ity. According to the National Low In-
come Housing Coalition, in my district,
the Massachusetts Seventh, two-thirds
of residents and renters and those at
minimum wage must work at least 84
hours a week to afford a decent one-
bedroom at-fair-market-rent apart-
ment.
When housing is in such short and
perpetually deteriorating supply, we
must ask ourselves: Where do we ex-
pect people to go?
When housing prices continue to sky-
rocket and we are constantly rede-
fining affordability to hide that re-
ality, where can people go?
For decades, this Nation’s public and
affordable housing supply has been
chronically underfunded. Any serious
solution must match the scale of this
unprecedented crisis.
States must act; cities must act; and
the Federal Government must act. How

we choose to spend our money is a di-
rect reflection of our values.
Representative OMAR’s Homes for All
Act invests a total of $1 trillion into
our Nation’s affordable housing stock.
I was proud to be an original cosponsor
of Homes for All, just as I was proud to
cosponsor Senator WARREN’s American
Housing and Economic Mobility Act.
However, it is the work of activists
and agitators on the ground that has
pushed this issue to the forefront.
While there is still much to do, I am
heartened by the efforts of my col-
leagues, and I associate myself with all
of their thoughtful and impassioned
comments and legislative proposals
highlighted during this Special Order
hour.
We must continue to mobilize, to or-
ganize, and to legislate until Homes for
All is no longer a promise, but a guar-
antee.
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I know
from my district in Detroit and
throughout the 11 other surrounding
communities, for us, being the third
poorest congressional district in the
country, housing is critical, critical
not only for economic stability, but
also in providing a safe haven for many
of our families across the district.
Poverty is complex. A number of fac-
tors, including State and Federal pol-
icy failures and racial and gender in-
equities, have resulted in so much in-
creased poverty, especially among chil-
dren. Adjusting poverty requires that
deep public investment in housing and
other infrastructure, healthcare access,
and public school investment, coupled
with criminal justice reform policies
designed to repair a history of segrega-
tion and continued exploitation.
Less than a year, Madam Speaker,
into its enactment, the opportunity
zone program has already resulted in
millions of dollars of wasteful spending
and possible corruption.
From cities like Chicago and Balti-
more to the city of Detroit, billionaires
were able to divert public tax dollars
through a tax break called the oppor-
tunity zone that was supposed to lead
to access to housing for our most vul-
nerable in communities like mine.
Instead, Madam Speaker, what we
heard from an investigative report—
ProPublica published an article, titled:
‘‘How a Tax Break to Help the Poor
Went to NBA Owner Dan Gilbert.’’ The
article contained disturbing details
that suggest that opportunity zones
that were in the Trump tax scam had
designated census tracts that did not
meet the legal criteria and that polit-
ical donations and influence had over-
ridden the law to reward donors with
generous tax breaks supposedly in-
tended to benefit the poor.
Madam Speaker, in the article, bil-
lionaire Dan Gilbert’s Quicken Loans
company donated $750,000 to President
Trump’s inauguration fund, hosted
Ivanka Trump in 2017 for a panel dis-
cussion, and last year Dan Gilbert
watched the midterm election returns
at the White House with President
Trump, who has called Gilbert ‘‘a great
friend.’’ In return, Madam Speaker,
three census tracts in downtown De-
troit where Gilbert owns valuable prop-
erty were selected for these large tax
breaks through the opportunity zones.
According to ProPublica, multiple
studies have found that property val-
ues in those zones increased because of
this tax break. At least one of those
census tracts did not meet the poverty
requirement for being an opportunity
zone and appears to have been des-
ignated solely due to political influ-
ence.
So, if we are going to talk about
housing justice, we are going to talk
about impacting and helping ensure
that housing is a human right, we also
need to take out the corruption and
the political influence.
Email exchanges revealed Quicken
executives working in concert with the
White House to designate tracts with
Gilbert’s investments as opportunity
zones. Madam Speaker, Quicken Loans
lobbyists were directly involved in the
selection process at every level, lob-
bying the city, State, and Federal offi-
cials to include Gilbert’s investment
zones in the opportunity zone law.
b 1615
So I am asking us as we stand for
housing for all that we need to restore
public trust in our Federal Government
which has been eroded with the rules
that have been applied unevenly here
and seem to reward the wealthiest and
the best-connected among us. It ap-
pears that a tax program supposedly
designed to benefit the poorest among
us is now being used to reward political
donors and wealthy investors.
I have asked the Committee on Ways
and Means to investigate the actions
by billionaire Dan Gilbert, and I have
also asked the Treasury to respond to
some of those questions.
This is why instead of these tax
breaks for the wealthy and for billion-
aire-led development, I have proposed
the BOOST Act.
The BOOST Act would give 3 to $6,000
to families making less than $100,000. It
would instantly lift up 45 percent of
Americans living in poverty now.
Sixty-four million children would be
instantly uplifted out of poverty. The
BOOST Act would be paid for by re-
pealing the Trump tax scam. In there,
Madam Speaker, you saw not only the
opportunity zones, but a number of tax
breaks for the wealthy that only bene-
fited the folks who are corporate-led
who have actually been tainting our
process to get access to affordable
housing in this Chamber.
So I ask my colleagues, as we propose
many fixes to access affordable housing
and to repair some of the historic seg-
regation zoning laws and the continued
exploitation among many of our neigh-
bors, that we also make sure that we
are ensured that corruption within our
government is not expanding and that
we are holding those accountable who
are trying to taint that process.
So I really appreciate my colleagues,
members of the Congressional Progres-
sive Caucus, in standing strong for
housing as a human right.
Many of the proposals you see for-
ward, Madam Speaker, will only de-
pend on whether or not we can imple-
ment it in a way that is just and is
very democratic and, again, has really
clear oversight. Things like the oppor-
tunity zone are not the direction that
we need our country to go in, and I am
looking forward to introducing legisla-
tion that would not only ask for re-
pealing the opportunity zone but actu-
ally use it for land trust and commu-
nity trust funds, things that will be
rooted within communities and help
those who, again, are seeing homeown-
ership among communities of color de-
crease, seeing increases between 30 to
50 percent of their income going to-
wards rent. I think the way we have to
do it is all those goals, not only pro-
posals, but also making sure that we
are implementing it in a way that is
just and fair.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN).
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentlewoman for the op-
portunity to speak, and I commend her
for her stellar effort to bring justice to
the housing circumstance in our coun-
try.
I am honored to say that I did visit
her congressional district, and we had
a field hearing that was quite success-
ful. She truly is engaged and involved
in making a difference in her commu-
nity.
Madam Speaker, I was there in 2008
when we had the housing crisis. I re-
member when Secretary Paulson came
before the committee. He was there in
need of some funds for what were called
toxic assets. He was there because the
market was in a free fall. He was there
because there was an imminent crisis
that had to be contained.
I remember him asking for a large
sum of money with few pages, probably
less than 5 pages. He wanted us to in-
fuse capital into a process that would
allow us to purchase these toxic assets.
He was indicating to us that this was
an emergency. He did not ask for hun-
dreds of millions of dollars. He did not
ask for tens of billions of dollars. He
requested hundreds of billions of dol-
lars.
I do recall that I spoke to constitu-
ents, and being the judicious person
that I was, I did pay attention to my
constituents who encouraged me and
insisted that I not bail out the big
banks. That was the language that was
used: Do not bail out the big banks, AL.
I was judicious. I listened to my con-
stituents. When we took the vote on
the floor to accord the sum of 700-some
billions of dollars, I remember standing
over in the door and looking at the
vote. I could also see the stock market
at the same time. As the bill was fail-
ing, the stock market was crashing. It
was a day that I will never forget. I
went back home, and I visited with my
constituents.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9287
December 5, 2019
The constituents said to me: AL,
what is wrong with you? You did not
vote to save my 401(k). You let the
market fall. You could have voted to
support us.
I learned an invaluable lesson that
day. The lesson is this: there are times
when you have to do what you know to
be the best thing, even when your con-
stituents might stand in opposition to
it. That is the lesson that I carry with
me to this day. I came back. We had a
second vote, and I voted for the funds
necessary to deal with the toxic assets.
One of the reasons why I was so con-
cerned about this was because I under-
stood what was happening. There were
instruments that were in the market-
place that were not suitable for every-
one. We had something called a 327 and
a 228; 3 years, 2 years of a fixed rate,
and then 27 years or 28 years of a vari-
able rate. This was not suitable for ev-
eryone. We had no-doc loans, meaning
no documents necessary, and you could
walk in and work out some means by
which you could acquire a loan, Madam
Speaker. We had negative amortiza-
tion, a process that allowed you to at
some point continue to owe more than
you initially borrowed.
We had something called the yield
spread premium. The yield spread pre-
mium allowed the person who origi-
nated your loan to originate a loan for
you for an amount in excess of what
you qualified for. Here is how it
worked: That person would check to
see what you were eligible for as a rate.
You could qualify for a loan at 5 per-
cent, but at that time because of the
yield spread premium, the person origi-
nating could come out and say, good
news, I have a loan for you for 8 per-
cent. You qualify for 5, you get a loan
for 8 percent interest, and the person
would never have to tell you that you
qualified for the 5 percent. The money
between 5 and 8 was called the spread,
and the yield on that spread could be
shared with the person who originated
the loan and the lender, the yield
spread premium.
Poor people, well, people who are of
little means who acquired homes with
these 327s and 228s, that I mentioned
where the rate would go up and down,
they lost homes. It is said that in the
African American community a gen-
eration of wealth was lost—a genera-
tion. The community is still recovering
from the 2008 downturn.
I believe that we do have to recon-
sider how we address housing in this
country. There are some people who
are born into poverty. They are not
born into plenty. For those who are not
born into poverty, it is not easy to
work your way to plenty. So we have
to have housing as a means by which
they can acquire and accumulate
wealth.
One of the things that I tried to do—
and there are many things that can be
done—is to use something called alter-
native credit scoring. This is where you
will score a person’s light bill, gas bill,
water bill, phone bill, and cable bill
and use that information with the tra-
ditional credit to allow that person to
have maybe the little additional help
needed so as to acquire a loan. It is a
pilot program. We have passed the bill
out of committee. It is H.R. 123.
This piece of legislation will allow
many, many persons with thin files and
with little credit, because they haven’t
been in the credit market, to get a
home. Many people who are paying now
X number of dollars for rent will be
able to acquire a home for X minus
some amount, meaning less than what
they are paying for rent, they will be
able to acquire a home.
I am pleased to say that many of the
prudential agencies are in agreement
and are encouraging this. Just today
we had a hearing with the Housing,
Community Development and Insur-
ance Subcommittee, and Mr. Mont-
gomery, who is the head of FHFA, was
there. I will be visiting with him. He
and I agreed to have an appointment so
that we can talk about these things
and see what we can do to help with
homeownership for persons who were
not born in the suites of life and many
who now find themselves living in the
streets of life.
This is something that is an impera-
tive. It is a moral imperative. It is
something that we have to do because
we want to have a just society, and a
just society would afford an equal op-
portunity to all to have a place to call
home. In the richest country in the
world, every person ought to have a
fair opportunity to have a place to call
home.
I thank the gentlewoman for allow-
ing me to share, and I encourage her to
continue on her mission to bring jus-
tice to those who find themselves liv-
ing in places that, quite frankly, most
people in Congress would not live in
under any circumstances, but, unfortu-
nately, we are not doing enough to help
others to be extricated from the cir-
cumstances of which we speak.
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I yield
back the balance of my time.
f
PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICING
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT) is recognized
for 60 minutes as the designee of the
minority leader.
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker,
what we are going to do today is actu-
ally sort of a little follow-up with a
couple of other things sprinkled in
here.
I want to walk through, once again,
some of the numbers and some of the
good things that have happened. I want
to talk also about H.R. 3, which is a
reference pricing bill that has gone
through Ways and Means in regard to
pharmaceuticals that actually I don’t
think anybody understands what the
underlying mechanisms are on how Eu-
rope and those actually do set drug
pricing and to understand the ration-
ing that will be coming with that.
But, first off, what is the greatest
threat to our society?
I am going to argue it is actually the
coming mountain of debt. It is not Re-
publican or Democrat, it is called de-
mographics. There are 74 million of us
who are baby boomers. 74 million baby
boomers were born in an 18-year period,
we have our earned entitlements com-
ing, and we functionally have no cash
in the bank for them. So this board is
really, really important, and I can’t be-
lieve I don’t see it in everyone’s office
here.
This is a 30-year window. Let’s actu-
ally just pull out Social Security and
Medicare. Madam Speaker, you do real-
ize that if you look at the Social Secu-
rity and Medicare from the numbers,
we have $23 trillion in the bank. Now,
this one is not inflation adjusted, so
these are raw numbers, but $23.1 tril-
lion, if you want to be accurate, in the
bank, but when we roll Social Security
and Medicare in and their financing
costs—the money has to be borrowed to
keep the promises—we are functioning
at $103 trillion in debt.
b 1630
It is math. It is not Republican or
Democratic. It is demographics. We are
getting older as a society.
Since 1971, our birthrates have been
below replacement rates. We need to
deal with the reality of math, but as
this place now proceeds, we will make
math partisan. But the math will al-
ways win.
It breaks my heart because there are
things we can do policy-wise that make
it work, that keep us under or right
about that 95 percent debt-to-GDP, and
we survive our demographic bubble.
But we have people around here that
say crazy things that have no basis in
economics, no basis in the math, no
basis in our demographics. The cruelty
they are bringing down on our society
and my 4-year-old daughter, destroying
her future, is because of the unwilling-
ness to own a calculator.
So, one more time, if we pull Social
Security and Medicare out of our 30-
year window, we have $23 trillion in the
bank. If we put them back in, we are
$103 trillion in debt in that 30-year win-
dow. Remember, just the growth of So-
cial Security, Medicare, healthcare en-
titlements, just the growth every 5
years equals the entire Defense Depart-
ment.
When you hear some of our brothers
and sisters on the left come behind the
microphone and say, ‘‘Well, if we would
just reduce defense spending,’’ you can
wipe out all of defense spending, and in
5 years, you are back where you began.
That is the reality of our demo-
graphics. How many people have you
heard come behind these microphones
in the last year, other than myself and
maybe one or two others who work on
these things? It is silent because it is
really hard to talk about. It is really
difficult. It is scary. It is the single
thing that destroys our economic vital-
ity for the future. But once again, it
would require owning a calculator.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9288 December 5, 2019
It is lots of people’s fault, but it is
Congress’ fault, but it is decades old.
Here is where most of that comes
from. If you take some of the math for
a couple that retires today—it is not
their fault; this is just the math—they
will have put about $161,000 into Medi-
care. They are going to receive just shy
of $500,000 out. Take that, functionally,
$300,000-plus difference, multiply it by
74 million, and now you understand the
driver of our debt.
You will hear people come behind the
microphone and say, ‘‘Well, it is waste
and fraud,’’ or, ‘‘We don’t tax rich peo-
ple enough.’’ Those are all absurd. The
percentage of tax revenues as the per-
centage of GDP is within the margin.
Waste and fraud, yes, we need to deal
with it, but it would be a fraction of
these numbers.
Remember, we are about to come up
on the 2-year anniversary of tax re-
form. This last fiscal year, unlike
every economist that the left brought
to us out of the crazy—and I know that
is mean, but it is true.
Things that were being said on this
floor when we debated tax reform, re-
forming our system: ‘‘Oh, revenues are
going to crash.’’ ‘‘The world is coming
to an end.’’ ‘‘It is Armageddon.’’
We went up over 4 percent in what
they call receipts growth last year. Our
problem is that we spent dramatically
more than that. I think our spending
was approaching almost 7 percent
growth because we had so many things
added to spending. About half of that 7
percent is just, once again, demo-
graphics. But we grew revenues even
with the tax reform slightly over 4 per-
cent.
There should have been joy around
here, if you think about where we are
economically. You all saw the applica-
tions for unemployment today, 10,000
down from what the projection was.
Once again, we are demonstrating
the labor markets are a miracle. They
are remarkable. I don’t think there is
anyone living today who has lived in a
time that is this economically stable,
when you look at our labor markets,
when you look at wage growth, the
lack of inflation.
There should be joy on this floor,
talking about the miracle of our broth-
ers and sisters who were being written
off just a couple years ago because they
didn’t have a high school education,
didn’t have a certain skill, were going
to be part of the permanent underclass.
It turns out those folks who were
willing to write off those brothers and
sisters, those Americans, were wrong.
That population—and I hate this term,
but we use it—those lower quartiles of
economics—education, skill sets—who
were being written off, they have had
the fastest movement of income. You
saw the number, if anyone cares about
these things.
Last year, a single woman, no part-
ner in the house: 7.6 percent growth in
wages. These are numbers that I can
tell you from being on the Joint Eco-
nomic Committee for years that every
economist we would bring in would
look at us like we were out of our
minds if we predicted numbers like
that. Where is the joy?
The fact of the matter is there has
been more progress in the last 24
months for our brothers and sisters
who have physical issues, have had sub-
stance abuse issues, have had criminal
records, these sorts of things, coming
back into the labor force.
There is this thing called U–6 data,
U–4 data, all these things. When you
see the unemployment rate and all this
information of workers who might be—
we use the term ‘‘marginally attached’’
and haven’t been looking, who quit
looking, the number of those who are
moving into the labor force that we
barely give any credit for when we see
the top-line number because the top-
line number is those who are looking.
There is an economic miracle hap-
pening right now when you see the
robustness, the stability of our labor
markets. Shouldn’t the debate on this
floor be: It is working for our brothers
and sisters who we have always said
were poor or that we were writing off.
Something is working for them. How
do we keep doing more? How do we
keep adopting the policies that are
working and avoid the crazy policies of
just a couple years ago that didn’t
work, that punished these populations?
These are the folks who had just a
really crappy decade. They fell further
behind every single year. There is some
math out there, and it is not all put to-
gether. I am being maybe a little
pathologically optimistic here, but
there are some preliminary numbers
that last fiscal year could be the very
first year in modern times where in-
come inequality did not grow and po-
tentially shrank. It is not because
wealthy people didn’t make more
money. It is because poor people made
more money than they had before.
Where is the joy? Where is the discus-
sion of how we do more of this?
It turns out, for all those out there
who are busting their backsides, work-
ing, paying into programs like Social
Security and Medicare, why aren’t we
being honest with them that the scale
of the unfunded nature is devastating?
If you are a young person today, do
understand that when you hit your
peak earning years, your tax rate will
have to be double today’s just to main-
tain these basic earned benefits. There
is a path, but that path requires a
whole bunch of things.
It is going to be my very last board
that I am going to put up because you
have to have incredible economic
robustness, and you have to have a tax
system that maximizes economic vital-
ity, an immigration system that maxi-
mizes economic vitality, a regulatory
system that uses smart technologies to
maximize labor force incentives, fam-
ily formation incentives, technology
adoption incentives, all these things.
And there is a path to deal with this.
Then what happens this week is the
discussion of H.R. 3, which is the drug
reference pricing model. Almost no one
has read it or understood the actual
mechanisms it is offering.
Why do I bring this up as part of an
economic discussion? Part of the mir-
acle we are about to live is that we are
about to live in a time where tech-
nology, if we legalize it, is about to
crash the price of healthcare.
Technology is something that looks
like a big kazoo that you blow into
that instantly tells you that you have
the flu, instantly can update your med-
ical records on your phone. If we make
it legal, it can instantly order your
antivirals.
When I talk about healthcare tech-
nology, it is a whole string of things
that will keep us healthy. But the
other side is that we are about to live
in the time of miracles. The single-shot
care for hemophilia, it is here. It is
going to be really expensive, but hemo-
philia is also really expensive.
We should be talking about ways to
have more of these disruptive pharma-
ceuticals that take care of hemophilia,
ALS, Crohn’s, cystic fibrosis, and sick-
le cell anemia. We are on the cusp of
having the pharmaceuticals that either
stabilize or cure these.
They are incredibly expensive. These
are small populations, but remember, 5
percent of the population with chronic
diseases is the majority of our
healthcare spending.
If we go back to the slide here, the
majority of what is about to hit us
over the next 30 years is Medicare. It is
healthcare spending.
What happens if you crash the price
of healthcare? Well, one of the ways
you do that is you cure people.
The Democrats are pushing a piece of
legislation that sounds at first really
good. ‘‘Hey, we are going to lower new
drug prices by reaching out to a hand-
ful of European countries and getting
their prices. Then you can’t go more
than that, or we are going to give you
a 95 percent tax,’’ which if you reverse
it is a 1,950 percent tax.
Except, you have to understand, and
I know this board is really hard to
read, we are going to use the Great
Britain model. What is a year of you
being healthy worth? It is an honest
question because that is what is about
to be imported into the country. For
you, your family, your child, what are
you willing to believe is the value of a
year of health? If you are in Great
Britain, their model, their formula, is
$38,000.
If this breakthrough pharmaceutical
would make you healthy for 1 more
year and costs more than $38,000, it is
not purchased. It is not part of the for-
mulary. That is what the Democrats
are saying we need to import into this
country.
So understand that the Democrats
are about to say a year of you being
healthy is not worth $38,001. I don’t
think they know that. I don’t think
anyone who has read it understood how
this handful of European countries
builds their pricing mechanisms, but
they do it by scarcity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9289
December 5, 2019
They basically say, ‘‘Hey, I know this
would cure you for the next year, but
you are out of luck. It is over $38,000
here in Great Britain, so you are on
your own.’’
At a certain level, this is just incred-
ibly cruel. How could you look some-
one in the eyes and say: ‘‘I value your
life at $38,000 for a year of you being
healthy.’’ But that is the cruelty that
is being discussed.
At first, it sounds really wonderful:
‘‘Hey, we are going to lower drug prices
by using reference pricing.’’ But the
fact of the matter is, how do you tell
Americans that what this means is not
only are you not going to be able to
have these things that keep you
healthy anymore because they are
going to be outside the price window,
but the other thing is there was a
major report put together early this
week that also said a substantial num-
ber of the drugs, like 100-plus, that are
in the pipeline, that are about to cure
our brothers and sisters who are part of
that 5 percent of the chronic conditions
that is the majority of our healthcare
spending, those cures are going to stop
because they are really expensive, real-
ly risky, really hard to put together?
The vast majority of them fail, so
they sort of roll the dice and say: ‘‘If
we succeed, we get a fairly decent pay-
day, but it is going to pay for a whole
lot of failed drug trials.’’
We are about to make a policy deci-
sion as a country: ‘‘We are not going to
cure you. You get to suffer.’’
The pharmaceutical industry, for all
the frustrations, they will go back to
what they were doing a couple of dec-
ades ago, saying they are just going to
do a derivative on an existing drug, so,
therefore, they have very little re-
search costs. They already know what
their profit margin is. It is nice and
safe to do.
The things the Republicans did in
this Congress, where we did the CURES
Act a few years ago, where we created
a pipeline to cure people, that pipeline
is about to get crushed.
You have to understand the cruelty
of this. This is just math. This is what
other countries do on their formula.
If you really wanted to crash the
price of pharmaceuticals, it turns out,
yes, there is a whole list of things that
are bipartisan: the way you deal with
the capital that is used for the invest-
ments, the way you do the patents, the
way you allow competing types of bio-
logics and others come to market.
But there is another crazy thought
experiment here that almost no one
has ever talked about. Do you realize
that half the pharmaceuticals that will
be picked up today, so half the pharma-
ceuticals someone is going through a
drive-through for or walking into their
pharmacy for right now, half of them
will not be used or will not be used
properly? Just part of the thought ex-
periment.
They will not be used or will not be
used properly. That is going to cost the
country about half a trillion dollars
this year. It is 16 percent of the total
U.S. healthcare expenditures because
people don’t take their prescribed phar-
maceuticals properly, and they get sick
and die.
It turns out we have all sorts of
things we could do today, but it re-
quires being creative. Let’s face it, this
is an absolute creativity-free as well as
a math-free zone.
The little bottle that has the top
that tells you when grandma has
opened it so that you know she is tak-
ing her pharmaceuticals that keep her
alive, we have that technology. It is
not very expensive. It changes drug ef-
ficacy usage because you know when
you took it.
How many of you know someone that
has multiple pharmaceuticals they
take, and they have to take them at
certain parts of the day? We now have
little distribution devices. There are
several of them on the market that
drop the pills, tell you the time, let
you know if you don’t pick them up. It
rings your phone, rings the family’s
phone, if they are not picked up.
b 1645
It turns out there are technology
things that could actually change al-
most a half a trillion dollars of ex-
penses a year. This is dramatically big-
ger than blowing up the cures that are
coming, but it requires some creativity
to understand that half of the pharma-
ceuticals that are being picked up
today will not be taken or will not be
taken properly.
Another proposal—and do it more as
a thought experiment: For really high-
value pharmaceuticals, go look in your
own personal medicine cabinet right
now. How many of them are still sit-
ting in there? They are just getting
old. You did not take them. They are
just sitting there.
Why don’t we package those high-
value ones in a double-layer blister
pack or in a pod that keeps them ster-
ile and allow you to return them?
Maybe there are folks in our society
who those really expensive pharma-
ceuticals, if they were returned and
could be redistributed, they would still
be sterile.
There are creative ideas where you
could have this massive disruption in
the price that we as Americans put out
in our drug costs. But it requires some
creativity instead of the arrogance of
we are basically going to blow up your
future. Because that is what is being
proposed to us.
But this number is stunning, if I
came to you and said, if you could
change the way pharmaceuticals are
used and have the efficacy of proper
use, it is 16 percent of all the
healthcare expenditures of this coun-
try.
I threw this slide in as more back to:
Remember how we were just talking
about Medicare and, functionally, that
is the ultimate driver of our future
debt and, unless we have a disruption
in healthcare costs—not debates about
how we finance, but disruption in the
cost. Let me give you a single example
of what the investment in cures means.
I know this chart is almost impos-
sible to read, but the simple point is
about 30 percent of Medicare spending
is going to be diabetes. A single cure—
now, diabetes is complex. We know it is
more than the production of insulin.
There are autoimmune responses.
There is 1 and 2. It is complex, but do
the thought experiment with me.
If you cured diabetes tomorrow, al-
most 30 percent of that unfunded liabil-
ity of Medicare goes away. That is why
it is so incredibly important we are in-
vesting in these cures that H.R. 3 is
about to destroy.
We always either start or end with
this slide. We are trying to make a
simple point that, if we can get the pol-
icy correct here, we can have an amaz-
ing future. The United States can have
an amazing future.
But we have spent almost the year
here—2019, we have, functionally, done
nothing.
Do you remember all the promises of
we are going to work bipartisan be-
cause we have a Republican Senate and
then, obviously, the left, the Demo-
crats, control the House here? We are
going to work together. We are going
to do all these creative things to-
gether. And we have done none of it.
We have spent lots of time on im-
peachment. We have pushed out a
handful of bills that were just almost
crazy in their policy sets to satiate the
radicalized face of the Democrats.
I am sorry. I know that is mean, but
it is true.
So let’s take a step backwards and
pull out our calculators and under-
stand, once again, that 30-year window,
$103 trillion of debt—if you actually
normalize it to inflation adjusted.
Okay. So it is, at today’s discount
rate—I am not sure. It would probably
be somewhere in the $83 trillion of
debt, inflation adjusted.
So here is our argument: Get the
things that grow the economy right.
We have demonstrated getting the Tax
Code right has produced a miracle of
economic growth in the way of labor
participation. Our brothers and sisters,
people, are working. And it turns out
those have cascade effects in every-
thing from health to there will be falls
in substance abuse use. We see great
things happening.
But with economic growth, we have
to get immigration correct. We have to
get trade correct. We have to get the
way we regulate, using technology. In-
stead of a 1938 model of fill out lots of
paperwork and shove it in a file cabi-
net, and when you screw up, we pull
out the file cabinet so we can sue you,
using crowdsource technology where
we know, if you screw up, we catch you
instantly and we can fix it right then.
There are amazing changes right
here.

courage families? How do you build an
immigration system that actually is

more talent-based so you maximize
economic growth so we can keep our
economic promises?
How do you encourage people to be in
the labor force?
One of the very odd things we see in
the data is that December, a year ago,
suddenly we saw in the data statistics
millennial females moving into the
labor force at substantial numbers but
millennial males still substantially
underperforming. Why? Is this the
opioid crisis? Are there other factors?
We need to know those sorts of
things because, it turns out, when we
have entire quartiles of our population
who are underperforming in the labor
market, it has really bad societal cas-
cade effects.
So let’s work on policies that get as
many folks who are interested. Wheth-
er you be retirement age or that mil-
lennial male, what do we have to do as
a society to encourage, to prod, to push
for you to be in the labor force? Be-
cause that is important not only to you
as an individual, but it is really impor-
tant to the country’s economic sta-
bility.
Technology disruption: We just
talked about the curative drugs that
are coming. We also can talk about the
sensors and the other things that are
going to allow us to stay healthy. How
do we update the laws so that thing
like that flu kazoo isn’t illegal?
There is a reason you didn’t go to
Blockbuster Video last weekend. Tech-
nology changes. We need to make sure
our law sets are sympathetic to the
changes that can reduce our prices in
healthcare, to protect the environment
and so many other things.
Yet we are decades behind in the way
we write laws here and understanding
how to future-proof those laws so,
when we have disruptive technologies—
and anyone who is really interested in
this, pull out your phone. Go to a
search engine, and go look up ‘‘MIT
ambient air capture’’ and look at the
miracle they have.
If what they have published is cor-
rect on, now, their price per ton—they
believe they can pull CO2 right out of
the air or do it right over a smoke-
stack. If those numbers are correct, we
now have a major change in CO2 emis-
sions in the world because of our abil-
ity now, at amazing prices, to be able
to pull it almost right out of the air.
These technologies are here. Why
aren’t we here talking about them on
the floor, and how to encourage more
of it and how to get it rolled out in so-
ciety, not only here, but across the
world? Because, if you actually care
about global warming—or climate
change or whatever the current pop
term is—it turns out there are amazing
technology disruptions that are here.
The only problem is they don’t allow
you to control other people’s lives;
they just solve the problem. And are
we about solving the problem or just
the control freaks who are often the
Members of this body?
And then other things: The earned
entitlements. You have earned your
Social Security. You have earned your
Medicare. Are there things we can do
in those benefits to encourage you to
stay healthier; to, if you feel like it,
work; to actually, instead of taking
your benefits, say how long would you
like—if we gave you a spiff, would you
wait?
There is tinkering you can do here
that actually makes the programs
more sound. And if you do it all to-
gether, we believe we have a model
that provides an economic future
where we are not destroyed by the
growing debt.
But there is no single answer. It is
going to have to be almost a holistic
approach of lots of types of policies
woven together, and every single one of
them needs to be about the reality of
our demographics.
And now the experiment I will ask
you all to engage in: Watch the floor
this week and see how many people
will ever come behind these micro-
phones and talk about the economic
growth and survival of this country be-
cause of what is about to happen, the
debt that is about to crush us and the
fact that we are not talking about it.
Instead, we are busy, basically, doing
levels of absurdity around here.
The cruelty you have just also sub-
jected my 4-year-old daughter to—and
her economic future—you should all be
ashamed of yourselves, ourselves, my-
self, because there is a path. The prob-
lem is this path doesn’t ideologically
satiate those who have just gone so ex-
treme.
But the math is real, the math
works, and the math, Madam Speaker,
always wins.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
f
IMMIGRATION POLICY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes.
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker,
obviously, most of the newspapers, in-
sofar as people still read newspapers,
most of the TV shows in the last month
have focused on the impeachment hear-
ings. And we all know that, at the end
of the day, impeachment or no im-
peachment, President Trump is not
going to be removed in the next year.
So the question is: Why are we spend-
ing so much time on impeachment?
I have felt, in the long-term future of
America, the most significant thing
going on right now is what is going on
with immigration policy in the United
States; and as long as this impeach-
ment hearing has taken the top of the
page in the newspaper, immigration is
at the bottom of the page.
I believe one of the primary reasons
for keeping immigration from the pub-
lic is they don’t want the public to
know what is going on in immigration
or what isn’t going on in Congress with
regard to immigration.
At its worst, we allowed over 140,000
people in this country in May. Presi-
dent Trump has been asking for help in
this crisis, and he has gotten no—or
virtually no help from Congress. Never-
theless, things that President Trump
has done on his own have reduced that
figure, if only temporarily.
I mention again, 145,000 people
caught and processed in May and prob-
ably over another 10,000 people not
even processed. That number has gone
down to around 45,000 in September,
and we believe it will be even lower in
October. This is largely because of
things that President Trump has done
on his own.
He has negotiated with the Mexican
Government—to a certain extent,
under threat of tariffs—to put Mexican
troops on the southern border.
The Mexican Government is patrol-
ling the interior of its country for peo-
ple trying to work their way north, and
President Trump has reached agree-
ments with the triangle countries of
Central America, the countries of Gua-
temala, El Salvador, and Honduras,
and they are currently taking people
coming from farther south who need
asylum.
President Trump has also—we wish
he was doing more here, but he began
building a wall, and we are working our
way toward adding another 450 miles of
wall by the end of next year. This is a
significant improvement toward what
it should be, but we are still well short
of where we want to be.
What should Congress be doing, or
what should we be focusing on while
Congress is spending time debating im-
peachment?
First of all, we have a shortage of de-
tention beds. So, when ICE is trying to
remove people from this country, there
are a lack of beds to place people in.
There is no reason why, given the
amount of money we are spending here,
that should not be taken care of.
There have been requests for another
5,000 people in the Border Patrol, and
there are still, unquestionably, people
streaming across this border every
month who aren’t even counted be-
cause we are not taking care of them.
b 1700
But there are other things that can
be done as well. There is the Traf-
ficking Victims Protection Act.
Some people talk about children
being separated from their parents.
This is something that Congress can
solve on its own.
Right now, if children try to come
here, single children from Mexico and
Canada, they are returned to their par-
ents to make their families whole. In a
loophole in the law, if children come
here from countries other than Canada
and Mexico, we are bound to keep them
and separate them from their families.
Congress should act, and the same
law that applies to Mexico and Canada
should apply to Venezuela or Honduras
or Guatemala. We have no business al-
lowing the current law to continue in

which people are coming here while
their parents are in another country.
We have the Flores settlement in
which, right now, people have to be re-
leased after being detained for 20 days.
Given the slowness of our court sys-
tem, it is not unusual for people to
have to be released prior to the time
when a hearing takes place. Again,
Congress should act and spend time on
that rather than continue to spend
time on impeachment.
We continue to have a problem with
sanctuary cities in which, when we
want to remove people even from in-
carceration types of facilities or from
jails, particularly from jails, sanctuary
municipalities are not allowing us to
remove people, even criminal people.
Congress should act, and Congress
has not acted, so that we do not allow
these sanctuary cities to forbid access
to the jails for ICE to remove people
from this country.
Another thing that should be done is
something should be done about the
credible fear standard and when people
are allowed in this country and when
people are not allowed in this country.
But, again, Congress has refused to act.
I want to point out that we can do all
these things without being anti-immi-
grant.
And something that hasn’t been no-
ticed in the most recent year: Over
800,000 new people were sworn into this
country, and President Trump is doing
nothing to reduce that figure. As a
matter of fact, that 830,000 figure is
well over the 700,000 figure of the rel-
atively recent past.
President Trump is a friend of legal
immigration, but we have to stop being
a friend of illegal immigration.
In other things that encourage people
to come here, Secretary Carson is
going to bat and trying to keep our
limited, low-income housing stock
available for our own citizens and not
people who are here illegally. It would
be good if Congress stepped up to the
plate and said we are going to put our
homeless veterans ahead of people who
are in this country illegally.
President Trump is also trying to put
work requirements in the SNAP pro-
gram. And let’s be honest: If we have a
program giving away free food without
a work requirement, that is an induce-
ment for people from other countries
to come here.
Congress should, again, convene and
bring bills to the floor that put a work
requirement with the SNAP benefit. A
work requirement with a SNAP ben-
efit, making it a less advantageous
welfare program, would stop sending
the message for the rest of the world to
come into the country.
So, in summary, there are a variety
of things that have to be done and that
Congress should be acting on and that
the mainstream media and even the
conservative media should be paying
attention to because they are going to
affect the future of this country for the
next 10 or 20 or 30 years, unlike the im-
peachment inquiries which we know
are going nowhere, although the im-
peachment inquiries are keeping other
things off the page.
We need more detention beds.
We have to change the credible fear
standard so that less people are able to
come in this country without doing
something, without having a genuine
fear.
We have to change the 20 days in the
Flores settlement so we are not re-
quired to release people in the country.
And above all, we have to change the
Trafficking Victims Protection Act so
that we can remove children from this
country and send them back to their
parents in Central America.
I don’t know why, with so many peo-
ple in this institution purporting to
claim that they want families to-
gether, we do not amend our current
laws and do with other countries what
we already do with Mexico and Canada,
and that is tell an unaccompanied
minor: You belong with your parents.
We are not going to separate you from
your parents.
However, Congress is not acting. And
I think one of the reasons they are able
to get away with not acting on this is
because the papers are filled with im-
peachment, impeachment, impeach-
ment all day long.
So, in summary, I hope we pay atten-
tion to the number of people coming in
this country.
I hope we congratulate President
Trump on the things he was able to do
without Congress doing anything, con-
gratulate him on the reduction of—I
will play with my mind here a little
bit—reduction of over 70 percent, about
75 percent reduction in the number of
people who are processed in this coun-
try compared to 4 or 5 months ago.
But I also think we have to pay at-
tention to the things that we are not
finishing at this time, and I hope the
media and the American public does
not take its eye off the immigration
ball while we focus on the impeach-
ment hearing.
And I really hate to say it, but I do
believe one of the reasons why some
people want to keep impeachment in
the news is, as long as impeachment
dominates the news, we are not talking
about Congress’ neglect in doing what
they should do to secure our border and
to make sure that the people coming
here are people coming here for legal
green cards, legal work visas, and,
eventually, to be sworn in as legal citi-
zens.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Majestic God, Your name fills the
Earth. In spite of our challenges, You
continue to rule with Your love, wis-
dom, and power. Grant that our law-
makers may not forget the many dan-
gers, toils, and snares You have al-
ready brought our Nation through.
Lord, give our Senators the wisdom
to know that You continue to direct
the steps of the faithful and that we
have nothing to fear. Spirit of God,
arise within our hearts and prepare us
for the task of this day. Surprise us
again with Your ability to transform
dark yesterdays into bright tomorrows,
doing for us more than we can ask or

We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent to address my
colleagues for 11⁄2 minutes as in morn-
ing business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
f
WORLD BANK
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
believe I have developed a reputation
among my colleagues, and hopefully
among my constituents, for trans-
parency in the issue of the public’s
business should be public. That applies
to how the World Bank loans U.S. dol-
lars. The World Bank is right now try-
ing to sneak through a new policy that
offends me.
I received word that the World Bank
is planning to vote right now, as I
speak, on a new country partnership
framework with China. That frame-
work commits the World Bank to pro-
viding China with billions of dollars in
loans indefinitely. What is odd about
this is that China is now the world’s
second largest economy and its per
capita income is well above the levels
at which countries are supposed to
graduate from needing World Bank as-
sistance. In other words, China should
stand on their own two feet without
help from the American taxpayers or
even indirectly through the World
Bank.
It happens that our country is the
World Bank’s largest contributor, and
the spending bill that funds the World
Bank includes a provision for a big cap-
ital increase from the American tax-
payers to the World Bank. With this
legislation pending, we in the Congress
have an opportunity to weigh in and we
should take that opportunity to make
sure that American taxpayer dollars
don’t go to China, particularly when
China is taking their own money and
investing in the Belt and Road Initia-
tive to get influence around several
countries on the face of the Earth.
I will have more to say later on this
topic.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
I ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.

f
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
for weeks now, the Republicans have
been asking the Democrats to take off
their impeachment blinders and let
Congress legislate for the American
people. We have argued that American
families deserve better than this par-
tisan paralysis, where the Democrats
literally obsess over impeachment and
obstruct everything else.
This very morning, for example, the
Speaker gave a speech on national tele-
vision to push forward her rushed and
partisan impeachment, with not one
word on the outstanding legislation the
American people actually need—noth-
ing on the USMCA or the NDAA or
funding for our Armed Forces. It is all
impeachment, all the time. Only in
this town, only in Washington, does
anybody think it is OK for our Armed
Forces to go unfunded and for a major
trade deal to go unpassed, because the
Democrats are too busy hosting a panel
of law professors to criticize President
Trump on television instead of being
busy on the things the American peo-
ple actually need us to address.
The Kentuckians I represent cannot
believe our military commanders are
being denied certainty, our men and
women in uniform are being denied sta-
ble funding, and 176,000 new American
jobs are being held up all because the
Democratic leadership thinks there is
more political advantage in obstruc-
tion than in doing their jobs. Well, the
servicemembers and personnel in the
Kentucky National Guard and at Fort
Campbell, Fort Knox, and the Blue
Grass Army Depot aren’t going to sim-
ply stop doing their jobs. No, they are
counting on us to pass critical defense
legislation that reforms housing and
spousal employment programs, that in-
vests in construction, readiness, and

modernization, and that locks in—lis-
ten to this—the largest pay raise in a
decade.
These bills touch every single State.
Of course, there are major national and
international issues at stake, as well,
but the Democrats are still holding the
NDAA hostage for a partisan wish list
that is meant to appease trial lawyers,
public sector unions, and their own far-
left base. They are holding up the
NDAA over unrelated, nongermane,
leftwing wish-list items.
Meanwhile, the Speaker and the
Democratic leader are withholding
their assent from important bipartisan
provisions like the Caesar Syria Civil-
ian Protection Act, which has pre-
viously passed both Houses and has
been modified to resolve all concerns
by the committees of jurisdiction. Un-
like the Democratic leader’s rhetoric
on Syria in recent weeks, this bill
would actually do something to stand
up for the Syrian people and hold
Assad accountable. So I hope the
Democratic leader will allow this im-
portant demonstration of our support
for the Syrian people to go forward.
In the meantime, as if to underscore
that the Democrats’ top priority is per-
formance art for coastal elites and not
the people’s business, I understand the
Speaker of the House spent part of this
week in Madrid, talking about climate
change. She took an international
flight to discuss carbon emissions. So
the Speaker was in Spain, lamenting
President Trump’s decision to pull us
out of the Paris Agreement. Maybe she
pitched her conference’s Green New
Deal—its socialist plan to hurt our
economy for American families—while
bigger emitters like China go roaring
right by.
As an aside, over the past 15 years,
the United States’ carbon emissions
have actually fallen significantly. We
appear to be on track for another de-
cline in 2019. Meanwhile, Paris Agree-
ment signatories, like China and India,
continue to emit more and more every
year. China already emits, roughly,
twice as much as the United States,
and it is increasing every year.
Kentucky and many other States
know exactly what happens when
Washington Democrats ignore these
facts and decide America needs to take
on unilateral economic pain for no
meaningful change in global emissions.
We are still trying to recover from the
Democrats’ last ‘‘War on Coal.’’ We
certainly don’t need the Speaker of the
House to promise the Europeans that
she is going to start a new one. So
working Americans and their families
are not well served by the Democrats’
political performance art. What they
really need are results.
The only path to results is bipartisan
legislation, and, fortunately, it is a
well-trodden one. There are 58 consecu-
tive annual defense authorizations to
prove it. Always in the past we have
been able to overcome these partisan
differences and go forward. There is a
bipartisan-bicameral agreement that
the Speaker and the Democratic leader
signed just a few months ago to help
them find their way back to the table,
but the agreement needs to be honored.
I hope they do so sometime soon.
f
NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
on another matter, while we wait for
our Democratic colleagues to let this
legislation move forward, the Senate
has used the time to confirm more of
President Trump’s impressive nomi-
nees for the Federal courts.
Some of my friends across the aisle
complain that we devote too much
time to nominations. First, I would
like to remind everyone that district
judges are the kinds of nominations
that, historically, have sailed right
through the Senate in big groups by
voice votes. If our Democratic col-
leagues want to spend less time voting
on district judges, they should take it
up with the Democratic leader, who is
forcing us to take cloture vote after
cloture vote. As of this morning, we
have taken cloture votes on 81 district
judge nominees.
By this point in President Obama’s
Presidency, we had taken one cloture
vote on a district judge nominee. Let
me say that again. As of this morning,
we have taken cloture votes on 81 dis-
trict judges. By this point in President
Obama’s Presidency, we had taken one
cloture vote on a district judge nomi-
nee—just one.
At the comparable point in the five
Presidencies preceding President
Obama’s, combined, we had not taken a
single cloture vote on a district judge’s
nomination—not one. Yet, 3 years into
the Trump Presidency, there have been
81 cloture votes and counting just on
district judges. So there is your answer
on floor time.
More broadly, I want to take a mo-
ment to help clarify why I and millions
of other Americans care so much about
having Federal judges who believe in
the radical notion that words matter
and that a judge’s job is to follow the
law and the Constitution.
Take, for example, the subject of re-
ligious freedom. The liberty of con-
science and the freedom to live out our
faiths has been a foundational principle
from the Republic’s earliest days.
Many of the first Europeans who ar-
rived in the New World came here after
having fled religious persecution.
James Madison wrote that religion
‘‘must be left to the conviction and
conscience of every man; and it is the
right of every man to exercise it as
these may dictate.’’
Samuel Adams said in the summer of
1776 that America would be the ‘‘last
asylum’’ for ‘‘freedom of thought and
the right of private judgment.’’
Let me contrast the Founders’ under-
standing with a couple of current
events. Last month, New York State
convinced a district judge to throw out
the Trump administration’s conscience
protection rule for healthcare pro-
viders. This straightforward rule en-
sured that healthcare workers could
not be forced to perform or assist with
medical procedures that profoundly
violated their religious beliefs. Yet the
radical Democrats in New York could
not abide by this basic protection for
people of faith. Instead, they wanted to
force Christians and other people of
faith who work in healthcare to either
assist in procedures like abortion or
lose their jobs—so much for freedom of
conscience.
New York’s behavior is part of a dis-
turbing trend. Powerful interests on
the left want to shrink freedom of reli-
gion until it means freedom to go to
church for an hour on Sundays as long
as it doesn’t impact the rest of your
life. That shrunken interpretation is
nothing like what our Founders in-
tended, and, candidly, I am not sure
how much longer the modern Demo-
cratic Party will even believe in that.
A few months ago, a Democrat who is
running for President told CNN that
the government should take away the
tax-exempt status of churches and reli-
gious institutions that disagree with
leftwing positions. He was not some
fringe candidate. He was a guy whom
the Democrats and the mainstream
media had likened to John F. Kennedy.
He was openly suggesting the Federal
Government should punish churches if
liberals don’t like their social views—
how appalling.
These disturbing signs have not been
limited to the courts or to the Demo-
cratic campaign trail. Absurd anti-reli-
gious arguments have appeared right
here in the Senate. In the last several
years, some of our Democratic col-
leagues have tried, literally, to impose
religious tests on nominees for Federal
office. Just take the ‘‘no religious
test’’ clause and the First Amendment
and throw them right out the window.
Get rid of them.
Judge Brian Buescher, now a district
judge in Nebraska, was attacked by
two Democrats on the Committee on
the Judiciary for being a faithful
Catholic and a member of the main-
stream, worldwide Catholic group the
Knights of Columbus. He was attacked
for being a member of the Knights of
Columbus? In written questions, one
Senator called standard Catholic
teachings ‘‘extreme positions’’ and
asked if he would dial down his per-
sonal faith practice if confirmed. That
happened in the Committee on the Ju-
diciary of this Senate.
As our colleague Senator SASSE ob-
served at the time, the Democrats were
transparently implying that Brian’s re-
ligious beliefs and his affiliation with
his Catholic, religious, fraternal orga-
nization might make him unfit for
service. It was plainly unconstitu-
tional.
Judge Amy Coney Barrett, now a cir-
cuit judge on the Seventh Circuit, was
likewise subjected to a religious test
during her confirmation hearing. One
Democratic Senator literally asked: Do
you consider yourself an orthodox

Catholic? She was asked that in the
Committee on the Judiciary.
Another offered this bizarre and omi-
nous remark: ‘‘The dogma lives loudly
within you, and that’s a concern.’’
So, look, these warning signs on reli-
gious freedom are literally popping up
everywhere the modern political left
rears its head.
Religious freedom in America has
never—never—meant and will never
mean solely the freedom to worship
privately. It has never meant and will
never mean the ability to practice only
a subset of faiths acceptable to some
subset of politicians. What it means is
the right to live your life according to
the dictates of your faith and your con-
science, free from government coer-
cion.
If those statements strike anybody in
this Chamber as remotely controver-
sial, that is exactly why President
Trump, Senate Republicans, and mil-
lions of Americans are focused on con-
firming Federal judges who will apply
our Constitution as it was originally
written.

to the immediate consideration of Cal-
endar No. 212, H.R. 2486.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
The amendment (No. 1255), in the na-

Madam President, I know of no further
debate on the bill, as amended.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
further debate?
Hearing none, the bill having been
read the third time, the question is,
Shall the bill, as amended, pass?

ators from South Carolina, Tennessee,
Washington State, and Alabama be al-
lowed to speak for brief moments on
the great job they have done and that
I be given back my leadership time at
10:50.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee.
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President,
on behalf of all of us, I want to thank
the Democratic leader for his courtesy
and his support on this. He and Senator
MCCONNELL have made it possible for
us to do this.
I am going to limit my remarks to a
couple of minutes, and then Senator
MURRAY and then Senator SCOTT, Sen-
ator COONS, Senator JONES are here,
and we will finish by 10:50.
Madam President, it is hard to think
of a piece of legislation that would
have a more lasting impact upon mi-
nority students in America than the
bill that the Senate just passed.
I believe, in doing so, we have im-
proved the provision in the House bill
that was sent to us. That is what we
did; we amended a House bill that we
are now sending back to them. We have
been working with leaders in the House
to make sure that our bill is something
the House can accept and pass. We hope
that will happen in the next couple of
weeks, and here is the result of it hap-
pening: No. 1, a big step for historically
Black colleges and minority institu-
tions—permanent funding at the level
of $255 million a year for those institu-
tions that serve up to 2 million minor-
ity students. That is No. 1.
The second big step is one that Sen-
ator MURRAY and I and our committee,
Senator JONES, Senator BENNET, Sen-
ator KING, and many others have been
working on for 5 years to simplify the
form that students use to apply for
Federal aid for college. Twenty million
families fill out what is called the
FAFSA, a Federal aid form, every year;
then we have students who borrow
more than $100 billion a year. What we
have done in this bill is reduce the
complexity of filing that FAFSA form
by saying to students: You don’t have
to give your Federal tax information to
the government twice. We will take the
up to 22 questions that are a part of the
108-question FAFSA, and we will elimi-
nate them, and if the student gives his
or her express consent, the Internal
Revenue Service will answer those
questions for the student.
I can’t tell you how many times stu-
dents, parents, college presidents, Fed-
eral aid counselors have told me that
the application and the verification of
this information has discouraged low-
income students from coming to col-
lege.
Five and one-half million of the
twenty million students who fill out
these forms have the accuracy of those
forms questioned. This will eliminate
that for most of the students because
they will have to give that information
to the government only once.
I want to thank Senator MURRAY es-
pecially for her work on this. We work
together on the Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions Committee in the
Senate, but Senator COONS, Senator
SCOTT, Senator RICHARD BURR of North
Carolina—which has the largest num-
ber of historically Black colleges—and
Senator JONES of Alabama have also
been crucial with their support.
I yield the floor to Senator MURRAY.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington.
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President,
HBCUs, Tribal colleges, and other mi-
nority-serving institutions—or MSIs—
are an essential part of our entire high-
er education system, and those institu-
tions serve nearly 6 million under-
graduate students, a large majority of
whom are students of color or Native
students.
Funding for those critical institu-
tions should never be up for debate,
and now, because of this, it will not be.
I am so glad we have reached a bipar-
tisan deal that will permanently fund
HBCUs and MSIs.
I know many of our colleagues
worked very hard on this, but I espe-
cially want to thank Senator JONES for
his leadership in pushing to make sure
this got done, as well as my partner

Senator ALEXANDER, and, of course,
Senators COONS, SCOTT, and BURR.
I am also pleased that this legisla-
tion streamlines Federal student aid
for more than 20 million students ap-
plying for aid and nearly 8 million bor-
rowers.
Our Nation’s outdated and overly
complicated financial aid system is
forcing students and borrowers to jump
through too many hoops to access Fed-
eral financial aid and verify their tax
returns, which they have already filled
out, and to get help if they are strug-
gling to pay their student loans.
The FAFSA Act, which has been in-
cluded in this bill, allows data to be se-
curely shared between the IRS and the
Department of Education, making it
easier for students to fill out the
FAFSA and pay their loans.
This bill will strengthen privacy pro-
tections and how students and bor-
rowers navigate their financial aid
through a streamlined, more efficient
process.
This bill is also thanks to Jeff Appel,
an integral member of Federal Student
Aid who recently passed away. I am
grateful for his contribution, and I
know that he will be sorely missed.
There is one more way in which this
agreement we have reached is impor-
tant. This proves once again that we
can work across the aisle and get
things done when we all stay focused
squarely on what is best for students.
We have a lot of work ahead of us to
make higher education in our country
more affordable and accessible and to
hold schools accountable for student
outcomes and ensure student safety on
campus. I am hopeful that we can build
on this bipartisan progress we have
seen so far as we continue working to-
gether to reauthorize the Higher Edu-
cation Act in a comprehensive way.
Again, I want to thank all of my col-
leagues for their work on this, and I
look forward to more to come.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina.
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina.
Madam President, to avoid the risk of
being redundant, I want to put a little
skin on the bones as relates to what
this act really means to college stu-
dents, particularly those college stu-
dents entering into the process for the
very first time and their families.
What it means is simply this: Sim-
plification means more education for a
lot more students, and that is good
news. We oftentimes talk about the im-
portance of keeping the American
dream alive and keeping it well. This
will provide significant opportunities
for low-income students to get through
the process very quickly.
In South Carolina we have eight
HBCUs. The economic impact of those
graduates is around $5 billion of life-
time earnings. This bill makes that
more achievable, more attainable, and
keeps the American Dream alive and
well.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama.
Mr. JONES. Madam President, I am
rising today with just, for lack of a
better term, an incredible amount of
hope and excitement—something we
don’t always see on the Senate floor
these days. We go through so many
routine measures. We go through so
many political speeches. But today is
truly a day of hope and excitement and
optimism because we are on the verge
of a significant moment for our Na-
tion’s historically Black colleges and
universities and all minority-serving
institutions. I frankly hope that in our
partisan world we are living in and in
our partisan America, people across
this country are tuning in right now or
at least will follow what is happening
on the floor of the Senate today, where
a bipartisan coalition has come to-
gether for a significant and important
segment of our population that de-
serves the same economic and edu-
cational opportunities as everyone
else.
Fourteen months ago, I came to this
Chamber to introduce a permanent ex-
tension, an increase of funding for
these important institutions of edu-
cation. Nearly half of all the funding
they receive was set to run out on Sep-
tember 30, 2019. We secured a quarter of
the Senate as cosponsors of the bill,
and we laid out an ambitious proposal.
In the new Congress, with the clock
ticking down toward the deadline, we
offered a more modest but bipartisan
and paid-for plan to avert the looming
fiscal cliff. But our goal and the goal of
everyone here and the goal of all of
those, including my friend Senator
ALEXANDER, was to always reach the
ultimate goal of permanent funding, a
permanent solution for these impor-
tant institutions.
All told, these schools serve 6 million
students across the country. They are
often the foundation upon which fami-
lies begin to build generational
wealth—not just one person who goes
to college but generational wealth in
communities that have long faced sys-
tematic barriers to doing so. They cre-
ate good, sustainable jobs. They are
part of the very foundation of our high-
er education system in this country
and in my State in particular.
With all the due respect to my friend
Senator MURRAY from Washington,
there is a little controversy about who
has the most HBCUs. I would claim
that Alabama does with 14, but that is
for debate on another day. But we can
all agree that supporting these schools
and the students they serve is not a
partisan issue. I think we can all agree
on that. I think we have shown that we
can agree that funding should never be-
come a political football. We have all
been working toward the same goal.
To say the least, I am so deeply re-
lieved that today we forged this bipar-
tisan compromise that will allow these
schools the funding and the certainty
they need to go forward and continue
fulfilling their important mission.
I sincerely especially want to thank
my colleagues on the HELP Committee
and Chairman ALEXANDER and Ranking
Member MURRAY in particular for their
leadership and willingness to reach
across the aisle and find the common
ground for the better good of this com-
munity. I also want to thank my friend
Senator SCOTT from South Carolina for
joining me on what we have done over
the last couple of years to introduce
the FUTURE Act and to push it for-
ward.
I believe—and I have said this for so
long—that we have so much more in
common than we have that divides us.
This is just one example. It is why I
hope folks across the country are look-
ing and see that we can come together
and we can be unified.
I am grateful today because in addi-
tion to the permanent funding of
HBCUs and minority-serving institu-
tions, this agreement, as the Senator
from Tennessee said, includes a long
overdue, first big step toward simpli-
fying the FAFSA application.
Even with a law degree, I can tell you
that with my kids, trying to do that
made me pull out what little bit of hair
I have left. I didn’t need to do that. It
is not just a frustrating process; it can
be so intimidating that students or
their parents just walk away. In Ala-
bama alone, kids walked away from
millions of dollars of Federal financial
aid and grants, not just loans. The
FAFSA as it is today can be a huge
barrier for students who want to go to
college.
The proposal we have on the table
now will help save taxpayers and make
the FAFSA process less painful by cut-
ting up to 22 questions from the form.
It lays the groundwork for a broader
FAFSA reform that Senator ALEX-
ANDER and I have been working on to
cut even further to between 17 to 30
questions.
But getting across the finish line
today is not just about renewing fund-
ing or cutting redtape. At their core,
these issues are about opening doors of
opportunity for young people who have
talent and motivation to succeed in
college and in life, but they have not
necessarily had the financial means or
the family connections to do so. This is
about making sure we empower every
young person in this country to reach
their full potential and then pay it for-
ward for future generations. That is
what gives me hope standing here
today. It is what makes me excited
today.
Again, I want to thank my colleagues
for the incredible effort—Senators
ALEXANDER and MURRAY in particular.
Our hearts have always been in the
right place. We have always moved the
ball forward knowing that the long-
term goal was to help these families for
generations to come.
Thank you, Madam President.
I yield the floor.

ator from Delaware.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6867
December 5, 2019
and determined leadership of Senators
ALEXANDER of Tennessee and MURRAY
of Washington State.
I rise to join my friend and colleague,
the Senator from Alabama, who has
just given remarks following the Sen-
ator from South Carolina. At a mo-
ment when what most Americans see
on their televisions is partisan division
and dysfunction in the Senate and the
House, I just want to remind all of us
that we can get good, important, and
significant things done together, as
just happened on the floor a few mo-
ments ago.
For generations, American families
have worked and saved and strived to
send their children to college, but for a
long time, our Nation’s original sin—
the sin of slavery and racism—has left
a long shadow and a stain on access to
the critical opportunity of higher edu-
cation. In much of our Nation, for dec-
ades, African Americans were denied
entry to most of our colleges and uni-
versities and still today face unreason-
ably high barriers to higher education.
The establishment of historically
Black colleges and universities,
HBCUs, and other minority-serving in-
stitutions of higher learning has been a
critical answer to that tragic history
of discrimination.
Men and women who founded HBCUs
refused to accept a system of higher
education that denied opportunity to
African Americans, and over decades,
HBCUs have risen to become some of
our Nation’s finest academic institu-
tions. They have educated hundreds of
thousands of young men and women
who have gone on to do incredible
things and to be some of our Nation’s
greatest leaders.
That is why all of us who have come
on the floor today, Republicans and
Democrats, have acted to make a per-
manent commitment to supporting
HBCUs and minority-serving institu-
tions with Federal funding. We have
agreed to make permanent $255 million
in annual funding for HBCUs.
I am particularly excited about this
legislation because my home State of
Delaware is home to one of the finest
public HBCUs in the country, Delaware
State University. Founded in 1891, it is
one of the country’s premier land grant
universities. Over the last 125 years, it
has emerged as one of our Nation’s pre-
mier HBCUs, graduating some of my
State’s best accountants, business
leaders, researchers, scientists, teach-
ers, social workers, and much more.
My friend Dr. Wilma Mishoe, the Uni-
versity’s first female president, will
end her impressive tenure this month
and be succeeded by Provost Dr. Tony
Allen, who will continue the upwardly
rising trajectory of the Hornets of
Delaware State University.
Their research programs are impor-
tant drivers for innovation in a State
with a long history of invention. It is
home to the Delaware Center for Neu-
roscience Research, a partnership of in-
stitutions working to advance our un-
derstanding of our brains and how we
form thoughts, memories, and feelings
that may help unlock the key to addic-
tion and other challenges our country
faces. It is also home to OSCAR, the
Optical Science Center for Applied Re-
search, which is helping speed the de-
tection of disease, supporting our sol-
diers in detecting threats, and even
equipping the NASA Mars rovers with
improved sensors. Delaware State has
been the lead institution on grants
from NASA, NSF, and NIH in just the
last few years.
We are very proud of Delaware State.
The funding stream last year provided
$880,000 in critically needed funding for
STEM, faculty, research, and students.
Let me last reference something that
my colleagues have also spoken to: the
streamlining of the free application for
Federal student aid, or FAFSA, which
impacts 20 million American families.
I spent a long time—roughly 20 years
of my life—actively involved in the na-
tional ‘‘I Have a Dream’’ Foundation,
which provides college-access opportu-
nities for young people from families
with no means or experience of attend-
ing higher education. I myself sat with
dozens of young Delawareans and
struggled as we finished the FAFSA
form for them. This long-worked-for
solution that Senators Alexander and
Murray have advanced streamlining
this form from 108 questions to 22 is a
critical first step that will make a last-
ing difference for access to education
all over our Nation.
I am so grateful for the opportunity
to join this bipartisan coalition and
look forward to even more progress in
the months and years ahead.
Thank you.
With that, I yield the floor.
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader is recognized.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
first, let me thank my colleagues from
South Carolina, Tennessee, Washington
State, Alabama, and Delaware for their
hard work on this very important
issue. I appreciated their words, and I
think far more appreciated even than
their eloquent words is the fact that we
are getting this done, finally. I am so
glad for it.
Let me just add my words of support
for the FUTURE Act. A few minutes
ago, as I mentioned, we passed the FU-
TURE Act by unanimous consent. I am
so glad and grateful that the Senate
came together today to give these in-
stitutions and the students they serve
the certainty needed to continue focus-
ing on their important mission.
In America, we believe in ladders up.
People should have to climb those lad-
ders. No one is going to put them up on
a pedestal. But there should be the lad-
ders there so that if somebody wants to
work hard, they are given fair oppor-
tunity and barriers—sometimes bar-
riers based on bigotry and discrimina-
tion—do not stand in their way.
One of the best ladders-up we have in
America is our HBCUs. HBCUs make
up 3 percent of colleges and univer-
sities, but they produce 27 percent of
African-American students with bach-
elor degrees in STEM fields, 80 percent
of African-American judges, 40 percent
of African-American engineers, 50 per-
cent of African-American lawyers, and
40 percent of African-American col-
leagues here in the Congress are HBCU
graduates. So this is one fine ladder-up,
as are our other institutions that spend
much time helping Hispanic Americans
and Native Americans as well.
We need these ladders. They are part
of America. We should help them when-
ever we can. Tribal colleges and uni-
versities serving Black, Hispanic, and
Native American populations serve
more than 130,000 American Indians
and Alaska Natives, the most under-
served group in higher education. His-
panic-serving institutions have grown
by nearly 40 percent since 2009, helping
the Latino community make big in-
roads in college enrollment and com-
pletion. They now enroll 66 percent of
all Hispanic undergraduates but ac-
count for only 15 percent of nonprofit
colleges.
So all three of these types of institu-
tions—the HBCUs, the colleges and
universities serving American Indians
and Alaska Natives, and Hispanic-serv-
ing institutions—are amazing ladders
up. They are essential for making high-
er education accessible, affordable, and
attainable for all Americans; essential
for having that bright Sun—the Amer-
ican dream—actually shine on people
instead of it being some words that are
meaningless to them.
This is a very fine moment, and I
want to thank all of those who put this
all together and made it happen. We
can celebrate. Most of the things that
pass by UC around here—or many of
them—are really kind of small and nar-
row. This is not. This is very impor-
tant. And my salute to those who made
it happen, whom I mentioned earlier.
IMPEACHMENT
Madam President, now on a less
happy subject, this morning the Speak-
er of the House instructed House com-
mittee chairs to begin drafting articles
of impeachment against the President
of the United States. That is a very
solemn duty and solemn undertaking.
The Speaker’s decision comes after the
House Intelligence Committee reported
that its inquiry had ‘‘uncovered a
months-long effort by President Trump
to use the powers of his office to solicit
foreign interference on his behalf in
the 2020 election.’’
We know Russia interfered on
Trump’s behalf in 2016, and now he is
trying to make it happen again, this
time by trying to push Ukraine.
The charges against the President
are extremely serious. No belittling of
these charges will hold any water. The
charge to use foreign interference on
behalf of a candidate in the 2020 elec-
tions is dramatic and awful stuff.
These charges concern our national
security. They concern the sanctity of
our elections and the potential corrup-
tion of our Nation’s foreign policy for

personal political interests of the
President of the United States. The
gravity of those charges demands that
Senators, if Articles of Impeachment
are served to us, to put country over
party and examine the evidence with-
out prejudice or partisanship, which is
why it is so disheartening, con-
founding, and deeply disappointing
that, at this historic moment, I heard
the Republican leader criticizing in
such strident terms the process of the
impeachment inquiry in the House for
being too short and not including
enough witnesses or due process for the
President.
I respond on two counts. First, the
Republican leader is simply wrong to
suggest that the House process has
been anything but deliberate, even-
handed, and serious. Speaker PELOSI,
the House Intelligence Committee, and
the House Judiciary Committee are
proceeding exactly how the Constitu-
tion prescribes. But, second, it is the
height of hypocrisy to criticize the
House process for being too short and
not including enough witnesses when
the Trump administration is the one
blocking witnesses from testifying.
What hypocrisy? How can a leader
even say it with a straight face? Will
this febrile obeisance to President
Trump never cease? Are they so afraid
of him and his bullying that they can’t
admit the obvious truth and twist
themselves in pretzel knots to make
arguments that are so spurious? It is
the height of hypocrisy to criticize the
House for not including enough oppor-
tunities for the President to make his
defense when the President is refusing
to participate. It is the height of hy-
pocrisy to say that there are not
enough witnesses when we don’t hear a
peep out of the Republicans urging the
President to allow the witnesses that
the House wanted to come forward.
This hyperventilation about the
length of the House process and the
number of witnesses is simply ridicu-
lous. The Trump administration is re-
sponsible for those things, not House
Democrats. Everyone knows that. Ev-
eryone knows they have gone to court
to block witnesses and documents.
I remind my colleagues, if the Arti-
cles of Impeachment are indeed passed
by the House, Leader MCCONNELL and
Senate Republicans must work with
Democrats to set the parameters of a
fair and impartial trial. Every Member
of the Senate should support a fair
process. The House is running a fair
process now. We must do the same in
the Senate if it comes to that.
All week, I have been urging my Sen-
ate Republican colleagues not to
spread or even speculate about the dan-
gerous myth that Ukraine—not just
Putin—interfered in the 2016 elections.
The myth was invented by Putin’s in-
telligence services to deflect blame
away from Putin while driving a wedge
between the United States and
Ukraine, one of Putin’s top goals.
When certain Senate Republicans are
parroting Putin’s talking points, we
have a serious problem.
Hopefully, the overwhelming criti-
cisms of the Members who did that this
week have convinced them to stop and
back off in the Republicans’ absurd de-
nial of fact and total defense of Presi-
dent Trump, even when it is obvious
that he is not telling the truth. We
have reached a low moment, and
maybe the lowest of all was the mount-
ing of Putin’s conspiracy theory about
Ukraine.
Now, another insidious conspiracy
theory was doused with cold water this
morning. The truth comes out, Repub-
licans, sooner or later. Another theory
was doused with cold water when it was
reported that Attorney General Barr’s
handpicked prosecutor had reportedly
found no evidence that the FBI probe
into the Trump campaign was a setup.
Republicans in the House, conservative
media personalities, FOX News, and
other blind partisan loyalists to the
President have long conjured and ped-
dled these deep-state conspiracy theo-
ries without evidence.
The Attorney General is even using
the resources of the Justice Depart-
ment—which could be exposing Chinese
Communist Party’s spies or tracking
would-be radical terrorists or fighting
opioids or tackling ransomware at-
tacks on cities across the country—to
investigate the origins of the 2016
probe. Attorney General Barr’s actions
are presumably in the hopes of turning
up evidence to support these far-
fetched theories.
Well, too bad, Republicans. Too bad,
hard right. The Attorney General’s
handpicked prosecutor found no evi-
dence to these conspiracy theories,
that the investigation of President
Trump was started with evil and polit-
ical intent. The only evidence we have
is that the outlandish loyalist theories
peddled by President Trump and his al-
lies to defend this administration are
totally baseless.
BORDER SECURITY
Now, on another note, airport face
scans, this morning, it was reported
that the Trump administration will
propose a rule to require U.S. citizens
to have their faces scanned whenever
they enter or leave the United States.
This sounds like something out of
China. Currently, all U.S. citizens are
allowed to opt out of facial scans when
entering or exiting the country. Now,
the Trump administration is poised to
remove that option and make facial
scans mandatory for all travelers, in-
cluding U.S. citizens.
I have significant concerns about
what this policy would mean for the
privacy of every American citizen. Just
last year, a cyber attack of CBP com-
promised the personal information—in
this case, it was license plates—and fa-
cial data of just under 100,000 people.
Imagine if DHS were required to retain
the facial data of every American who
travels in and out of the country.
There are, of course, legitimate ques-
tions about whether the Federal Gov-
ernment is legally allowed to collect
and store this data. Those questions
must be answered before—not after—
the Trump administration moves for-
ward with its new rules. On something
as serious as this, Congress should de-
bate this issue.
Regardless, I see no reason why the
current opt-out policy must change,
and I will work with privacy advocates
in the Senate, like my friend Senator
MARKEY, to legislatively prevent the
administration from moving forward.
TRACED ACT
Another issue, robocalls, the House
of Representatives yesterday passed bi-
partisan legislation to crack down on
the tens of billions of robocalls that
plague Americans every year. All of us
are bothered by these darn robocalls.
They come at the worse times, and
they are on and on. You can’t even
shut them off.
Last year alone, Americans were bat-
tered by 48 billion—billion—robocalls.
That is 150 calls per person, per year.
Robocalls are annoying. They are per-
sistent, and beyond that, many of them
are dangerous to consumers. Foreign
companies can make thousands of calls
with a push of a button and can charge
Americans simply for picking up the
call. Can you believe that? Many are
designed to scam elderly Americans.
We have heard about elderly Americans
who are frightened and send their life
savings to these criminal callers. Many
of the calls target institutions like
hospitals and slow down important
businesses.
The TRACED Act passed by the Sen-
ate in May and recently amended and
passed by the House requires phone
companies to block robocalls without
charging consumers and will give the
Justice Department and the FCC better
tools to prosecute scammers who prey
on unsuspecting—many elderly—Amer-
icans. I am proud to be a cosponsor of
the original Senate bill. I pushed hard
to move it forward. The Senate should
now take action on the amended and
expanded robocall legislation from the
House and pass it before the year is
out.
As we saw with the recent legislation
to the democratic protests in Hong
Kong, when there is bipartisan con-
sensus on an issue, we can move swiftly
to enact bipartisan legislation. These
moments, unfortunately, are far too
rare under Leader MCCONNELL, who has
avoided the consideration of legislation
on the floor, even when it has bipar-
tisan support, but I hope as we enter
the final few weeks of the year, Leader
MCCONNELL will address the issue of
robocalls and send this bipartisan to
the President’s desk.
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6869
December 5, 2019
just agree with my friend, the demo-
cratic leader, on the issue of the nui-
sance of robocalls.
But as important as that is to our
quality of life and to protecting vulner-
able seniors and others who may be
misled by some of these deceptive
calls, some of the most basic functions
of the Federal Government have not
been fulfilled, like appropriating the
money that is necessary to support our
men and women in uniform. The bipar-
tisan spending caps bill that we agreed
to in August has been walked back by
our Democratic friends, and we find
ourselves with a lot of uncertainty
here at the end of the year in terms of
what the future may hold in terms of
our ability to actually get anything
done, things like pass a highway bill.
That is one thing that Republicans and
Democrats can all agree on, is our dis-
dain for traffic and congestion.
That is one thing we can work on to-
gether. We could work together to
bring down drug prices, particularly
the out-of-pocket costs for consumers
with high deductibles and high co-pays.
We could pass USMCA, the U.S.-Mex-
ico-Canada Trade Agreement. All of
these enjoy broad bipartisan support,
but unfortunately, they are now all
held captive by this impeachment
mania which has stricken the House of
Representatives, and it is scheduled to
come over here to the Senate probably
around the first of the year, depending
on the schedule that Speaker PELOSI
keeps in the House.
IMPEACHMENT
So while there are plenty of good
ideas out there about things that we
can work on together on a bipartisan
basis, we all know that the Senate and
the Congress has limited bandwidth.
We can’t do everything we want to do.
We need to prioritize. I would hope
that our priorities would be the Amer-
ican people’s priorities and not the po-
litical priorities here of partisans in
Washington, DC, but unfortunately, it
looks to me like the partisans are win-
ning and the people are losing. We need
to keep fighting against that. But that
is where we are right now, particularly
with Speaker PELOSI’s announcement
this morning that the House is now
going to proceed to draft Articles of
Impeachment, something that has only
been done four times in our Nation’s
history. This will be the fourth time.
We know what the outcome is likely
to be with the 67-vote threshold here in
the Senate, and I think all of us in
America listened or have been exposed
to anyway the various arguments on
both sides of the question, but I don’t
really, frankly, expect anything new to
come out of this. A lot of this is re-
hashed over and over again ad nauseam
in order to justify a partisan impeach-
ment process less than 1 year before
the next general election. I would
think we would be a little bit cautious
about 535 Members of Congress working
here in the Nation’s Capital reversing
the decision made by more than 60 mil-
lion Americans in the last Presidential
election. That is a very sobering and
serious matter indeed, but, unfortu-
nately, I don’t see this issue getting
the kind of sober and serious consider-
ation that the Founders contemplated
or that the American people deserve.
AMERICAN ENERGY
Mr. President, on another topic, a
number of our colleagues here in Wash-
ington have undertaken a radical ap-
proach when it comes to providing the
energy that our country needs. As a
matter of fact, if you think about it, it
is because of the energy being produced
by the oil and gas industry here in
America today that the average price
of gasoline is now probably roughly
$2.50 per gallon.
In Austin, TX, where I live, you can
drive from the airport to my home, and
you can see gas prices at $2.15 a gallon.
It is cheap relative to the historical
prices. And you think about what that
means in terms of consumers, regular,
everyday working folks and families. It
means they are able to spend money on
other things that are important to
them in their lives and not spend all of
their income on filling up their gas
tank. That is a huge, huge gift to the
American people and consumers, but
rather than focus on the benefits of
what our innovative and entrepre-
neurial industry has done, we know
that some of our friends here in Wash-
ington want to reorder the world in
their own image. They say the goal is
to completely eliminate the most af-
fordable and reliable sources of energy.
For what? Well, in pursuit of net zero
emissions. I will talk more about that
in a moment.
We remember earlier this year they
introduced the Green New Deal—argu-
ably the most extreme energy and cli-
mate proposal this country has ever
seen. The Green New Deal is chock-full
of utopian ideas but completely devoid
of any pragmatic plans to implement
any of its pie-in-the-sky proposals. It
puts a range of unrealistic environ-
mental and socialist policies under one
big green umbrella with an
unaffordably high pricetag.
The best evidence of how extreme
this proposal is, is when it came up for
a vote in the Senate. Not a single Sen-
ator voted for it—that includes all of
the cosponsors of the proposal. That is
not exactly a profile in courage, to tell
the American people this is the solu-
tion to our environmental and energy
problems, and then when it comes up
for a vote, you run and hide. Nobody
voted for it. If this proposal were not
so terrifying, it would be a terribly bad
joke.
While that may be the most extreme
proposal we have seen, it is not the
only one. We know some of our Demo-
cratic colleagues in the House have
tried to impose government mandates.
That means more regulation, more tax-
ation, more control by Washington, all
in an effort to achieve net zero emis-
sions by the year 2050. In some ways,
2050 seems like a long way off, and in
other ways it doesn’t seem a long way
off, but in pursuit of programs that
would address a problem in 2050, how
about let’s take care of the business
that is sitting here right before us
today first. We seem to have lost any
sense of urgency in our most important
priorities, like funding the government
and funding the military.
On top of that, a number of our
Democratic friends who are running for
President claim we should ban
fracking. I would really like to ask
them if they even know what that is or
how it works.
Some of them have said they also
want to ban the export of crude oil.
This month, for the first time in 70
years, America became a net exporter
of oil. I will talk more about that in a
moment.
Some are saying they even want to
go so far as to ban the use of natural
gas. Natural gas has been responsible
for taking formerly coal-fired power-
plants and putting them into a cleaner
energy source, which has actually re-
duced emissions by a substantial
amount, but, no, in pursuit of their pie-
in-the-sky utopian dreams, the
ideologues want to eliminate some-
thing that has been a very substantial
improvement in terms of the reduction
of emissions while providing affordable
energy.
I think it is safe to say that we all
agree—Republicans, Democrats, Inde-
pendents, everybody—we should do
what we can to protect our environ-
ment. In fact, we live here. We breathe
the air. We drink the water. We should
all be equally concerned about the en-
vironment.
I really think some of these proposals
are nothing more than virtue sig-
naling. They are not a solution to a
problem. All of these folks are trying
to paint the energy industry as the
enemy in the process. Every good story
needs a villain, and our friends on the
left believe the energy industry that
has provided that cheap gasoline so
people can drive to work, take their
kids to school, or go about their busi-
ness is really the enemy, not our
friend. Well, it is just not the case.
By the rhetoric you are hearing, you
would think oil and gas companies
have bankrupted the country, ruined
our international alliances, and sent
the entire globe into an energy famine.
Well, that is not true. It is just the op-
posite of truth.
When you talk about global energy
security, American oil and gas has re-
versed the tide of the energy landscape
in our favor and supported our friends
and allies around the world in impor-
tant ways.
Our colleagues proposing these un-
workable and unaffordable mandates
would be wise to look at how the global
energy landscape has changed over the
last half century and consider the
broader consequences of their proposal.
To understand the importance of
American energy on the world stage,
we need to rewind just a bit to the
1970s. At that time, the vast majority

of the world’s oil and gas came from
the Middle East, giving these nations a
great deal of power. In fact, you may
remember back in 1980 President
Jimmy Carter announced something
called the Carter Doctrine. He said if
any foreign power would block the flow
of oil through the Straits of Hormuz, it
would be an act of war. That is what
Jimmy Carter said in 1980, such was
our reliance on imported energy from
the Middle East. Our country dealt
with this situation, and we addressed it
responsibly and effectively.
We know another indication of our
dependence on imported energy is when
the United States supported our friend
and ally Israel in the Yom Kippur war
of 1973. OPEC, the organization of pe-
troleum exported countries, primarily
Middle East countries, banned the sale
of crude oil to the United States. Those
who are old enough to remember, re-
member that prices quadrupled, some
States banned neon signs to cut down
on energy use because they were wor-
ried about the energy that would be
necessary to create that electricity,
and a number of towns asked for citi-
zens not to even put up Christmas
lights. This was because our source of
oil and gas was cut off from the Middle
East, such was our dependence. Despite
strong domestic production, we were
still relying heavily on imports. Once
that supply was cut off, we were caught
flat-footed.
The Arab oil embargo brought to
light the risk of our energy independ-
ence and underscored the need for
America to do something about it.
There was a consensus—has been a con-
sensus—that we needed to grow our
supplies here at home so we were less
dependent on imports. So less than 2
years later, Congress, thinking we were
doing a good thing, put a ban on export
on American crude because we thought
we needed it here and didn’t want to
export it abroad.
Over the next four decades, a lot has
changed. Advancements in the energy
sector, including hydraulic fracturing
and horizontal drilling, have dramati-
cally increased the production of
American energy. As I said, for the
first time in 70 years, America has be-
come a net exporter of oil. That is how
dramatically this has turned around.
In the process, we have achieved our
goal of reducing our reliance on im-
ported energy from dangerous and un-
settled regions of the world, like the
Middle East, but pretty soon we found
ourselves sitting on a gold mine, and it
became clear it was time to lift the ex-
port ban. In 2015, after 40 years of no
exports, that is what Congress did. We
did so because we believed, No. 1, we
had more than we could use here in
America, but we also believed this
would be a huge boon to our economy.
That was part of the equation. Just as
we were able to reduce our reliance on
oil from unreliable and unstable re-
gions of the world, we knew that by ex-
porting the oil that America produced,
we could help other countries—our
friends and allies around the world—
that were dangerously dependent on
sources of energy from countries like
Russia that is all too ready to use en-
ergy as a weapon. They say: Do what
we say, and we will keep the energy
and gas flowing. Do something we don’t
like, and we will shut you down.
In the not-so-distant past, many of
our allies in Europe looked to Iran and
Russia for their energy needs, and the
Baltic States, all NATO allies, relied
almost exclusively on Russia for their
oil, gas, and electricity. Seven Euro-
pean countries depended on Russia for
80 percent of their gas, and on the
whole, one-third of the gas Europe con-
sumed came from Russia.
When our allies are looking to our
adversaries for basic needs like heat-
ing, electricity, and fuel, that is a real
problem. It is a strategic vulnerability
not only for those countries but also
for the United States.
Our friend John McCain had quite a
sense of humor—those of us who knew
him during his lifetime. He aptly de-
scribed Russia as a gas station
masquerading as a country. Russia’s
ability to export that energy to other
countries was the lifeline for their
country. I think Senator McCain hit
the nail on the head, especially when
Russia uses that energy as a weapon.
As I alluded, in 2009, we saw the vul-
nerability this created when Russia ef-
fectively turned the lights off in
Ukraine. For almost 3 weeks, they shut
down the energy supply. This affected
at least 10 countries in Europe whose
natural gas traveled through Ukraine.
Just as the United States realized
how dangerous our foreign oil reliance
was, our allies began to understand the
implications of their dependency as
well. Many of our friends in Europe
have been working to diversify their
energy supply, which is a good thing,
and build strategic gas interconnectors
between countries reliant on Russia for
natural gas. Getting a diversity of
sources is an insurance policy for those
countries so Russia can’t just cut off
their energy supply.
Supplying our friends around the
world with American oil and gas not
only strengthens our security but it al-
leviates the power our adversaries, like
Russia, hold in important regions of
the world, like Europe.
In addition to increasing global secu-
rity, American oil and gas has allowed
us to provide affordable, plentiful, and
reliable energy to countries struggling
to provide power for their own citizens.
If you think about it, low-cost energy
coming from America has the potential
to be the greatest poverty reduction
program in memory. For example,
when I first traveled to India in 2004—
if you drive from Delhi, the capital, to
Agra, where the Taj Mahal is, you will
drive across vast areas where the popu-
lation is very poor. Huge swaths of that
population lack access to things to
cook their food with or electricity to
light their homes. So what do they do?
Well, they burn cow dung; they burn
coal; they burn wood pellets or other
high-emission fuel sources. By America
agreeing to export the energy we have
here—the cleaner energy we have
here—we are agreeing to help one of
our closest friends and partners in the
world and, in the process, help Prime
Minister Modi and the leadership there
lift more Indians out of this grinding
poverty and relying on things like cow
dung simply to cook their food.
Last year, we doubled the amount of
LNG exported to India, and I dare say
that the sky is the limit.
I think many of our Democratic col-
leagues should reflect back on the les-
sons of history before advocating a re-
turn to the 1970s when it comes to the
way we approach American energy. I
understand the importance of innova-
tion in the energy sector to lower emis-
sions, and I am all in, but rather than
another government program, higher
taxes, more regulation, or surrendering
control of our freedom to Washington,
DC, why don’t we let the innovators,
the entrepreneurs, come up with solu-
tions? That is what has happened when
it comes to American oil and gas. They
came up with the answer, not Wash-
ington, DC, and we are all benefiting
from the results.
When it comes to innovation, I have
introduced legislation—and a number
of our other colleagues have, too—to
increase research dollars going into
ways to lower emissions by looking at
alternative ways to deal with energy
production, like electricity. For exam-
ple, there is a small natural gas-fired
powerplant in La Porte, TX—which I
visited with our friend Senator COLLINS
from Maine—that emits zero carbon di-
oxide. That is a boon to the environ-
ment, and I think it also provides a so-
lution to the oil and gas industry be-
cause what they do is pipe the CO2 off
the back end, and they use it to inject
into the ground in the oilfields, so they
produce more oil and gas. It is called
secondary recovery.
Here at home, it is easy to take de-
pendable energy for granted. We do it
all the time. We don’t worry about hav-
ing the energy to cook our dinner at
night or refill our cars’ gas tanks. We
take that all for granted. But the truth
is, in countless countries in the world
and for the majority of the world, it is
a completely different story.
For our friends who advocate these
utopian ideas like the Green New Deal,
I don’t begrudge their desire to im-
prove the environment, but I would ask
them to be more pragmatic when it
comes to trying to solve the problem. I
would ask them: Are you really trying
to solve a problem? If you are, we want
to work with you to reduce emissions,
but if your goal is to pursue some fan-
tasy that will not work and we can’t
afford, count me out. If you want to
solve the problem, count me in.
American energy is simply powering
the world. It is strengthening global se-
curity and lifting millions of people
out of poverty. We need to continue to
harness the power of one of our coun-
try’s greatest national assets.

REMEMBERING LAUREN BRUNER
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, on
September 10, just a few months ago,
Lauren Bruner, a veteran of Pearl Har-
bor, December 7, 1941, passed away. Mr.
Bruner wasn’t just any veteran. He was
a veteran who served on the USS Ari-
zona during the attack that morning.
On Saturday, December 7, millions of
Americans across the country will pay
tribute to the attack at Pearl Harbor
National Memorial to commemorate
what happened that morning, which
brought the United States fully into
the Second World War. Aboard the USS
Arizona were 1,512 officers, sailors, and
marines. The attack that day on De-
cember 7 killed 1,177 of them, and 335
brave people survived that morning.
Lauren Bruner, who passed away Sep-
tember 10, was one of four who were on
that ship that December morning in
1941 who have survived.
Lauren Bruner passed away at the
age of 98, and on this Saturday, his
ashes will be interred at the USS Ari-
zona to join his shipmates—those who
were lost that morning and others who
have joined their fellow sailors, ma-
rines, and officers since.
Three men remain that are veterans
of that war from the USS Arizona: Lou
Conter, 98 years old; Ken Potts, 98
years old; and Donald Stratton, 97
years old from Colorado Springs, CO.
Ken Potts and Don Stratton will join
together for most likely the last time
this Saturday as they will watch a live
video feed of the ceremony at Pearl
Harbor at the USS Arizona Memorial to
view the interment of their shipmate,
Lauren Bruner, at the USS Arizona.
The Senate was able to play a small
role in recognizing what brought Don
Stratton, Lauren Bruner, and the oth-
ers together. You see, on that morning,
when their ship was bombed, Lauren
Bruner had been shot in the leg and
Donald Stratton was on fire. The two
of them and four of their other ship-
mates were on a control tower as the
ship was on fire when a rope appeared.
It was a line from the USS Vestal, a
ship next to the USS Arizona. A line
was thrown from a sailor named Joe
George. They tied to the tower and
were able to shimmy across 70 feet
from the burning USS Arizona—while
they were on fire—to the USS Vestal, to
their safety.
Lauren Bruner had 70 percent of his
body burned and was shot in the leg.
Don Stratton suffered burns and spent
a year in the hospital as a result. He
went back into the service to continue
the rest of the war.
This Chamber in Congress helped
make sure that the gentleman who
threw that rope, that lifeline from the
USS Vestal to the USS Arizona, re-
ceived final recognition for his act of
heroism. Joe George went for decades
without recognition for his act of brav-
ery to save these six sailors. He was
able to receive just a couple of years
ago, on December 7, 2017, the Bronze
Star, in recognition of his acts.
December 7, 2017, also marked the
last time that Donald Stratton was
able to join the memorial service to
commemorate December 7, Pearl Har-
bor. I have this picture here that I will
show of Donald Stratton, who again
this weekend will be joining Ken Potts
as Lauren Bruner is interred to join
the other men and women who lost
their lives that morning.
This is an opportunity for us to once
again say thank you to the 2,403 people
overall at Pearl Harbor who were
killed, to the people who survived, who
went on to fight the Second World War,
and our veterans today who live and
continue to live a legacy that was
given to them that December 7 morn-
ing.
On Saturday, as we join our families
and do weekend work, I hope we will
take a little bit of time to reflect once
again on a dark chapter in American
history that led to a great American
century, to be thankful to the men and
women who served our country, to the
men and women who fight for our Na-
tion each and every day, to the people
like Ken Potts and Lou Conter and
Donald Stratton, who continue to re-
mind us each and every moment why
this Nation is worth fighting for.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington.
TAX REFORM
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I
come to the floor today to talk about
the importance of passing the expired
tax credit provisions for many small
businesses and industries that support
families and help revitalize economic,
depressed communities, and those that
are underserved.
We all know that 2 years ago, the Re-
publicans and President Trump enacted
a $2 trillion tax break for large cor-
porations, and there was a lot of lob-
bying here that went in to getting that
legislation passed. Yet, when it comes
to these provisions, which are just
about tax certainty in the Tax Code
that has been there for decades that
really needs to be reauthorized, Con-
gress is not getting the job done, and
we need to come to terms now about
why it is so important to help small
businesses have tax certainty in the
code, to help families and commu-
nities, and to get this provision done
by December 31.
We all know how important it is that
these individuals, green energy compa-
nies, economic development, and many
other aspects of the Tax Code are being
basically held hostage—since, I believe,
2017—by Congress’s inattention to this
issue. Our Tax Code is most effective
when we have certainty, predictability,
and when we have made decisions out
of Congress that we think we do want
to incent and motivate investment.
Renewables are a large source of pri-
vate sector infrastructure investment,
and the clean energy tax credits have
allowed industry to scale and invest in
technologies that have brought prices
down in wind by 68 percent and solar
prices by 88 percent. We have seen un-
believable growth in the energy sector
because of our investments in the
green energy tax credits.
Another example is the biodiesel tax
credit that I worked on with Chairman
GRASSLEY for years. That particular
tax credit and its uncertainty and
Congress’s failure to act and give pre-
dictability have led to more than 10
biodiesel plants being closed so far, and
there could be many more closed if we
fail to act before December 31.
This means a loss of jobs and a loss of
production of fuel. It means the loss of
economic benefit to regions, and it
means an impact to soybean and other
sectors that have been a part of this
growing economy. We need to act be-
fore more plants close.
I am very concerned about a par-
ticular facility in Grays Harbor, WA.
While it may employ only 37 people at
this point in time, Grays Harbor is an
important point in the Washington
State economy, located on our coast,
and has many great attributes posi-
tioned for the future of trade. Not only
do I want to see biodiesel grow, I want
to see biodiesel exports grow. I think it
is shortsighted that Congress can’t get
its act together to give people predict-
ability and certainty about the Tax
Code.
Let’s talk about some other examples
that are not just about clean energy—
for example, the medical expense de-
duction. These deductions give tax-
payers certainty on deductions for high
out-of-pocket medical costs, and these
are things that allow people to deduct
qualified expenses that exceed 71⁄2 per-
cent of their gross income through
2018. This year, the threshold increased
to 10 percent of adjusted gross income.
If we are not going to give people cer-
tainty, it is going to be more dollars
out of their pockets.
Another example is the mortgage
debt forgiveness. When you lose your
home, you should not have to pay taxes
on your mortgage debt. That is what is
going to happen if we don’t give people
certainty in the Tax Code. Without
this provision, if your house is fore-
closed on and the remaining debt for-
giveness is in bankruptcy, the amount
you would have to pay is the same
amount you would have to owe instead
of being forgiven.
So, to me, that inability to not have
that mortgage debt deduction—it is
just wrong that Congress can’t get its
act together. If you are going to get
your act together and pass a major bill

for corporations, you should at least
give small businesses and individual
taxpayers the certainty they deserve in
the Tax Code.
These provisions have been in the
Tax Code for a long, long time. This is
not like a surprise. It is not as if we
haven’t done this before. But instead of
taking care of today’s Tax Code before
December 31, people are off making
grandiose discussions.
I get it that some people on this side
of the aisle would like to change and
make corrections to the Tax Code, and
other people on our side of the aisle
would like to make a $100 billion in-
vestment in child tax credit. Look, I
am appreciative of that discussion, but
quit waging that battle, and do our day
job, and take the Tax Code and the ex-
piring provisions, and give taxpayers
certainty by the 31st of this month.
Another example is that the expired
provisions would help address the high
cost of higher education by allowing
students and families to deduct up to
$4,000 for tuition and other high edu-
cation costs. With total student loan
debt of $1.5 trillion and average student
debt of over $31,000, provisions like
these on deductibility are very impor-
tant.
On employment and economic devel-
opment, nearly 26 percent of the provi-
sions that are expiring are related to
incentivizing employment investment
in lower income communities.
The new markets tax credit. There is
probably not a Member in the Senate
who has not had a jurisdiction in their
State use the new markets tax credit
as one of the most effective economic
development and community tools.
This credit encourages private invest-
ments in low-income communities.
Since the program was enacted in 2000,
the new markets tax credit has deliv-
ered over $95 billion in project financ-
ing to more than 6,000 projects and cre-
ated over 1 million jobs.
Why can’t we have certainty on the
new markets tax credit by December 31
of this year? There is no reason.
The new markets tax credits expire,
and where are we going to be on build-
ing affordable housing, healthcare fa-
cilities, community clinics, research
and technology incubators, and mixed-
use commercial programs? I see no rea-
son why we can’t get this job done. I
have been working with Senators
CARDIN and BLUNT on a bill that would
make this program permanent, and,
hopefully, we wouldn’t have to go
through this routine every year.
But take another example. The work
opportunity tax credit has been an in-
credibly effective tool in helping indi-
viduals, including veterans, to find
gainful employment. The work oppor-
tunity tax credit provides up to $2,400
for hiring a certified person, including
veterans and people receiving SNAP
and TANF benefits. We know this pro-
gram works. In my State, for each per-
son certified to receive the tax credit,
there is a net savings of $17,700 in Fed-
eral subsidies. Where is the voice for
people who say: Let’s give a tax credit
and put people to work and actually re-
duce Federal subsidies? Oh, we are let-
ting it expire again and giving uncer-
tainty in the Tax Code.
Why? I am not sure because people
are too busy posturing in a big debate
instead of getting our basic tax ex-
tender homework done. Let’s not con-
tinue to fail. Let’s get out here and
give these work opportunity tax cred-
its the predictability people would like
to see. In 2013, Washington had over
26,000 individuals certified with the tax
credit, helping them find employment,
and that represented a total of $42 mil-
lion in savings.
All of these issues I am talking
about—investments in our commu-
nities, investments in tax credits that
give businesses certainties so that they
can continue to drive down costs, in-
vestments in low-income communities,
investments to help retrain and get
people off the subsidies—why can’t we
get this done? I hope that people will
understand that these small businesses
and these families don’t have people
running through the halls to lobby for
them as they did on the big corporate
tax break, but I guarantee you, they
deserve the tax certainty. They deserve
the predictability.
Yes, we can continue to debate the
last big tax bill all through 2020. I
guarantee you that we will spend a lot
of time talking about it, and each side
can raise their voice and wage their
battle. But do not fail to get this basic
job done that we keep failing to do—
literally, not giving these businesses
and individuals certainty, I think,
since 2017. People keep thinking you
are going to make it retroactive for 3
years. No, stop. Get this job done and
give the certainty to small businesses
and underserved communities that
they deserve. Help them to succeed just
like you helped big corporations.

ator from North Carolina.
NOMINATION OF RICHARD ERNEST MYERS II
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I rise
along with Senator BURR to urge our
colleagues to support the confirmation
of Professor Richard Myers to serve as
a district court judge for the Eastern
District of North Carolina.
President Trump has nominated an
eminently qualified and principled in-
dividual to serve in the Eastern Dis-
trict. In his career, Professor Myers
has worked as a journalist, a pros-
ecutor, and a professor. Each step Pro-
fessor Myers has taken in his profes-
sional career has prepared him for this
role. From the newsroom to the court-
room to the classroom, Professor
Myers has shown his commitment to
the principles of truth, of justice, and
of wisdom. I cannot imagine a more
solid foundation upon which to place
the responsibility of a district court
judgeship than that of Professor Myers,
which he has exhibited throughout his
career.
Professor Myers is a first generation
college graduate who has close ties to
Wilmington, where he has chosen to lo-
cate his chambers. Once confirmed,
Professor Myers will hold court in Wil-
mington, the same city where he was
raised, where he went to college, and
where he was a journalist. North Caro-
linians are lucky to have someone like
Professor Myers with his caliber and
his sense of duty to represent us in the
Eastern District of North Carolina.
I urge all of my colleagues to vote for
Judge Myers’, or soon-to-be Judge
Myers’, confirmation when it comes up
later today.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina.
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I also rise
today to voice my strong support for
the President’s nomination of Pro-
fessor Richard Myers to serve as a
judge in the Eastern District of North
Carolina. I might add for my col-
leagues that it is the longest court va-
cancy in the history of our court sys-
tem. Professor Myers was reported out
of committee on a strong bipartisan
vote on October 31. I am pleased that
the Senate will today consider his
nomination.
I want to give my colleagues some
additional insight into a man whom we
are asking them to vote on and that
goes beyond his stellar legal creden-
tials. The first thing I want my col-
leagues to know is that Professor
Myers embodies a work ethic and dili-
gence that we deserve in all of our
judges. As an immigrant of Kingston,
Jamaica, Professor Myers is a first-
generation college student in his fam-
ily. He worked his way through his un-
dergraduate degree at the University of
Wilmington, and after college he pur-
sued a career in journalism. He worked
for the Wilmington Morning Star. It
was his investigative reporting that
gave him the desire to earn his law de-
gree. He graduated magna cum laude at
the University of North Carolina
School of Law and began a legal career
as a clerk for Judge David Sentelle of
the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
Second, Professor Myers will be a
judge who understands the value of
public service, having made a career
change from practicing at a prestigious
private firm to contributing to our Na-
tion’s justice system following the at-
tacks of September 11, 2001. He said
that his change in career ‘‘was some-
thing I felt that I could do and that I
owed to a country that had been really
good to my family.’’
He did this first in the Central Dis-
trict of California and then in the East-
ern District of North Carolina. Pro-
fessor Myers then took a different path
of service at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, instructing the
next generation of lawyers to be people
who, in his own words, ‘‘do the right
thing every day.’’
If confirmed, Professor Myers will
serve on the Eastern District of North
Carolina and, as Senator TILLIS said,
will hold court in Wilmington. Iron-
ically, this court is currently meeting

in the building that once housed the
Wilmington Morning Star, his first job
as a reporter. However, when consid-
ering Professor Myers’ story, it seems
fitting that someone with the char-
acter, work ethic, and servant’s ap-
proach to life will be returning to the
building of his first post-college job
wearing the robe of a Federal judge. I
have faith in Professor Myers’ ability
to do the right thing every day in this
critically important role, and I am
grateful for the opportunity to speak
on his behalf to our colleagues. This is

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 150
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I
come to the floor again to seek unani-
mous consent for a resolution that
commemorates the Armenian genocide.
In October, the House of Representa-
tives passed a version of this resolution
by a vote of 405 to 11—405 to 11. This
vote was historic, and I applaud the bi-
partisan courage of those in the House
to stand up for what is right.
For those here in the Senate who
would consider objecting to this re-
quest, I urge you to think long and
hard about what it means for your rep-
utation, what it means for history, and
what it means for the Senate as an in-
stitution. History is watching, and it
will not look kindly on those who ob-
ject to recognizing genocide.
In recent speeches before the Senate,
I have laid out the case for why we
must move forward on this resolution.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6874 December 5, 2019
The simple threshold question for this
body comes to this: Do we recognize a
clear case of genocide when it happens,
or do we let a country like Turkey de-
termine our own views, determine our
own sense of history, determine our
own moral obligation, and determine
the public record—a Turkey that today
is committing atrocities against the
Kurds in Syria, a Turkey that has
teamed up with Russia and the Krem-
lin in purchasing the S–400 air defense
system and just recently used it
against an American F–16 to see if it
works, and a Turkey that works to
block forward movement in NATO on
key national security objectives of the
United States?
At what point do we say enough is
enough? At what point do we simply
move forward and acknowledge the
truth? The truth is that the Armenian
genocide happened. It is a fact. To deny
that is to deny one of the monstrous
acts of history. This denial is a stain
on the Senate and our country. We
have an opportunity to right that
wrong and put the U.S. Senate on the
right side of history.
Let’s again review some of that his-
tory here today. More than 104 years
ago, the Ottoman Empire launched a
systemic campaign to exterminate the
Armenian population through killings,
forced deportations, starvation, and
other brutal matters. How do we know
this? How do we know this? Because
U.S. diplomats were there. They wrote
it down and sent it back to the State
Department in Washington.
Henry Morgenthau, the U.S. Ambas-
sador to the Ottoman Empire from 1913
to 1916, wrote this in his memoir:
When the Turkish authorities gave the or-
ders for these deportations, they were mere-
ly giving the death warrant to a whole race;
they understood this well, and, in their con-
versations with me, they made no particular
attempt to conceal this fact. . . . I am con-
fident that the whole history of the human
race contains no such horrible episode as
this. The great massacres and persecutions
of the past seem almost insignificant when
compared to the sufferings of the Armenian
race in 1915.
That is what Henry Morgenthau said.
On June 5, 1915, the U.S. consul in
Aleppo, Jesse Jackson, wrote to Am-
bassador Morgenthau, saying:
There is a living stream of Armenians
pouring into Aleppo from the surrounding
towns and villages.
The [Ottoman] Government has been ap-
pealed to by various prominent people and
even by those in authority to put an end to
these conditions, under the representations
that it can only lead to the greatest blame
and reproach, but all to no avail. It is with-
out doubt a carefully planned scheme to
thoroughly extinguish the Armenian race.
On July 24, 1915, in a report to Am-
bassador Morgenthau, the U.S. consul
in Harput, Leslie Davis, stated: ‘‘Any
doubt that may have been expressed in
previous reports as to the Govern-
ment’s intention in sending away the
Armenians have been removed. . . . It
has been no secret that the plan was to
destroy the Armenian race as a race.
. . . Everything was apparently
planned months ago.
In an October 1, 1916 telegram to Sec-
retary of State Robert Lansing, U.S.
Charge d’Affaires Hoffman Philip
wrote, ‘‘The Department is in receipt
of ample details demonstrating the
horrors of the anti-Armenian cam-
paign. For many months past I have
felt that the most efficacious method
of dealing with the situation from an
international standpoint would be to
flatly threaten to withdraw our Diplo-
matic Representative from a country
where such barbarous methods are not
only tolerated but actually carried out
by order of the existing government.’’
And finally, Abram I. Elkus, who
served as the United States Ambas-
sador to the Ottoman Empire from
1916–17, telegrammed the Secretary of
State on October 17, 1916, stating ‘‘In
order to avoid opprobrium of the civ-
ilized world, which the continuation of
massacres [of the Armenians] would
arouse, Turkish officials have now
adopted and are executing the un-
checked policy of extermination
through starvation, exhaustion, and
brutality of treatment hardly sur-
passed even in Turkish history.’’
That continues to verify that these
diplomats saw the truth with their own
eyes and communicated back to their
superiors in Washington. They did
their job, and the historical record
proves it. Now it is up to individual
U.S. Senators to do your job.
The Government of Turkey has fund-
ed lobbyists willing to trumpet lies and
make excuses for these atrocities. The
Turkish Government and its sympa-
thizers have advocated for restrictive
laws on expression and against legisla-
tion that recognizes the Armenian
genocide. They will stop at nothing to
bury the truth. I hope that individual
Senators will not once again fall for it.
Any apprehension, any trepidation
on the part of Senators who believe
this resolution will somehow do irrep-
arable harm to our relationship with
Turkey is simply unfounded. Twenty-
seven countries have recognized the
genocide in one form or another. Some
saw trade increases in Turkey fol-
lowing their recognition. Twelve mem-
bers of NATO have recognized the
genocide. They still work with Turkey
on defense issues. They still have em-
bassies in Ankara. Their relationships
were not irreparably harmed. Belgium,
Canada, the Czech Republic, France,
Germany, Greece, Italy, Lithuania,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland,
and the Slovak Republic all did the
right thing.
I say to my friends and colleagues
that genocide is genocide. Senators in
this body should have the simple cour-
age to say it plainly, say it clearly, and
say it without reservation.
In every session of Congress since
2006, I have introduced or cosponsored
resolutions affirming the facts of the
Armenian genocide. When I was chair-
man of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, I was proud to preside over
the passage of an Armenian genocide
resolution out of the committee.
The work continues here today. If we
are not successful this afternoon, I
know we are not going to stop until we
are. I am not going to stop until I go
through every single Senator who is
willing to come to the floor and issue
an objection on behalf of the adminis-
tration because I think Armenian
Americans need to know who stands in
support of recognizing the genocide and
who opposes it.
I thank Senator CRUZ for joining me
in this effort. He has been stalwart
with me in this bipartisan resolution. I
thank the 27 additional Senators who
have been willing to stand up for a
true, clear-eyed vision: Senators VAN
HOLLEN, RUBIO, STABENOW, GARDNER,
MARKEY, CORNYN, WARREN, ROMNEY,
PETERS, PORTMAN, FEINSTEIN, WYDEN,
DUCKWORTH, REED, SCHUMER, UDALL,
HARRIS, WHITEHOUSE, SANDERS, KLO-
BUCHAR, CARDIN, BOOKER, CASEY, BEN-
NET, ROSEN, BROWN, and CORTEZ
MASTO. I thank them all.
Before I ask unanimous consent, I
yield to my colleague from Texas.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
YOUNG). The Senator from Texas.
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I am proud
to join with my colleague from New
Jersey today in urging the Senate to
take up and pass the bipartisan Menen-
dez-Cruz resolution affirming U.S. rec-
ognition of the Armenian genocide.
From 1915 to 1923, the Ottoman Em-
pire carried out a forced deportation of
nearly 2 million Armenians, of whom
1.5 million were killed. It was an atro-
cious genocide. That it happened is a
fact and an undeniable reality. In fact,
the very word ‘‘genocide,’’ which lit-
erally means the killing of an entire
people, was coined by Raphael Lemkin
to describe the horrific nature of the
Ottoman Empire’s calculated extermi-
nation of the Armenians.
We must never be silenced in re-
sponse to atrocities. Over 100 years
ago, the world was silent as the Arme-
nian people suffered and were mur-
dered, and many people today are still
unaware of what happened.
With this resolution, we are saying
that it is the policy of the United
States of America to commemorate the
Armenian genocide through official
recognition and remembrance. We have
a moral duty to acknowledge what hap-
pened to 1.5 million innocent souls. It
is the right thing to do.
I certainly understand the concerns
of some of my colleagues who worry
that this resolution could irreversibly
poison the U.S.-Turkey relationship
and push Turkey into the arms of Rus-
sia, but I don’t believe those concerns
have any sound basis.
As my colleague from New Jersey
pointed out, 12 NATO nations have
similarly recognized the Armenian
genocide. Yes, Turkey is a NATO ally,
but allies can speak the truth to each
other. We should never be afraid to tell
the truth, and alliances grounded in
lies are themselves unsustainable. Ad-
ditionally, in the coming days, the For-
eign Relations Committee will be

marking up an enormous package of
sanctions on Turkey.
The horse has left the barn. There is
no good reason for the administration
to object to this resolution, and the ef-
fect of doing so is to deny recognition
of this chilling moment of history.
Let me close by echoing the opti-
mism the Senator from New Jersey ex-
pressed. We may well see an objection
here today, as we did when Senator
MENENDEZ and I previously came to the
Senate floor and sought to pass this
just a couple of weeks ago, but I be-
lieve that in the coming days and
weeks, we will get this passed and that
this objection, I hope, will be only tem-
porary. I look forward to the day—
hopefully very, very soon—when all 100
Senators, Democrats and Republicans,
are united in simply speaking the
truth, recognizing the genocide that
occurred, and making perfectly clear
that America stands against genocide.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey.
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I
thank my colleague from Texas for his
eloquent statement and for his forth-
rightness on this issue.
As in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee be discharged
from further consideration of S. Res.
150 and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration. I further ask that
the resolution be agreed to, that the
preamble be agreed to, and that the
motions to reconsider be considered
made and laid upon the table with no
intervening action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota.
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, I don’t think
there is a single Member of the U.S.
Senate who doesn’t have serious con-
cerns about Turkey’s behavior both
historically and currently. In fact, I
support the spirit of this resolution. I
suspect 99 of my colleagues do. At the
right time, we may pass it, as Senator
CRUZ has stated; however, I don’t think
this is the right time. If there is a right
time, this certainly isn’t it. It is large-
ly because just hours ago, our Presi-
dent returned from the NATO summit
in London with NATO leaders, where
this was a topic of discussion with the
leadership from Turkey—this being the
acknowledgement of genocide, as well
as the purchase of the S–400.
I want to have a clear readout of the
President’s interaction and discussion
with President Erdogan and our delega-
tion’s negotiations with Turkey before
adopting this resolution. I don’t think
we can take the risk of undermining
the complex and ongoing diplomatic ef-
forts which are in our national security
interests as a country.
I, too, want to be on the right side of
history. I believe we will be on the
right side of history, but these negotia-
tions that the President is currently in
are a part of getting on the right side
of history.
I appreciate the ongoing conversa-
tions and still hope we will be able to
overcome the challenges in the bilat-
eral relationship with Turkey. We
know what these challenges are, and
we all share the goal of seeing them ap-
propriately addressed, but there is no
good alternative right now. In my
view, adoption of this resolution today
is unnecessary and might very well un-
dermine that diplomatic effort at a key
time.
I do not intend to continuously ob-
ject to this resolution, but I believe it
is appropriate for me to do so at this
time, so I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from New Jersey.
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, once
again, I am deeply disappointed. This is
the third time a Republican Senator
has come to the floor to object to the
genocide resolution—the recognition of
the genocide resolution. There is never
a good time. There is never a good
time. In my view, there is always the
right time, however, to recognize geno-
cide as genocide.
My colleague from North Dakota ac-
tually sponsored H. Res. 220, the Arme-
nian genocide resolution, affirming
‘‘the proper commemoration and con-
sistent condemnation of the Armenian
Genocide will strengthen our inter-
national standing in preventing mod-
ern-day genocides’’ when he was a
Member of the House of Representa-
tives. He was right then. He was right
then. The time was right then, and the
time is right now.
President Erdogan was here in the
United States a couple of weeks ago.
There was a meeting at the White
House. A few of my colleagues had the
privilege of joining the President ex-
pressing their discontent. Erdogan was
given options—a way out of the di-
lemma that Turkey has put themselves
in with the S–400. Basically, they were
told either return to Russia and de-
stroy them in our presence and/or give
them to us, which, of course, Russia
will never allow that to happen, for us
to have their technology.
There was a deadline. It was yester-
day. I waited until today to make sure
that in fact we wouldn’t intercede in
any way with that possibility. Turkey,
in the interim, while this is going on,
they used the S–400 to fire at an F–16 to
see if they could take it down. Really?
Really?
So this premise that there was a
meeting in NATO—well, there was a
meeting in Washington, and then there
was a meeting in NATO. They still
haven’t done anything on the S–400.
They still haven’t exercised any of the
options that have been given to them.
I just want my colleagues to know
that I intend to come once a week to
the Senate floor, and all those who
want to be listed on the wrong side of
history, they have the option of doing
so. I am not going to cease until we do
what is morally and principally right,
and that is to recognize the Armenian
genocide as a host of other nations
have done as well.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware.
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I serve on
the Senate Judiciary Committee, as a
member of the Bar Association of Dela-
ware, and a Member of the U.S. Senate.
I am concerned about the trans-
formation of our Federal judiciary
under this current administration. I
am particularly concerned about rising
issues around qualification and com-
petency. Let me speak to that, if I
might, for a few minutes.
This Senate is doing precious little in
terms of legislating, but we are moving
at a breakneck pace to confirm Presi-
dent Trump’s judicial nominees—
roughly, 150 so far. During the entire 8
years of the previous administration,
55 circuit court judges were confirmed.
Nearly that same number have been
confirmed in just 3 years of the Trump
administration—48. Nearly one in
seven of all U.S. district court judges
currently serving have been appointed
by President Trump.
I am deeply concerned about the
quality of some of these nominations.
Some have never taken a deposition,
argued a motion, let alone tried a case
in court. The American Bar Associa-
tion, the professional association of
lawyers, has ranked nine of President
Trump’s nominees as ‘‘not qualified,’’
which is an exceptionally unusual and
striking step for them to take.
This isn’t about whether the Presi-
dent’s nominees are conservative or
not. I understand that elections have
consequences and that a Republican
President will more often than not
nominate conservative judges. I have,
in some cases, joined my Democratic
colleagues in supporting qualified
nominees put forward by the adminis-
tration who have won support from
their home State Senators and ad-
vanced through a bipartisan judicial
nomination and confirmation process
in our committee, but let’s be clear. I
will not stand by while this adminis-
tration rams through nominees who
are not just Republican and not just
conservative but demonstrably un-
qualified.
I can’t support nominees with deeply
concerning records about their com-
mitment to justice and to advancing a
commonsense juris prudence. I am not
going to set a standard any lower than
what has been required in previous ad-
ministrations to serve on the Federal
bench for many, many years.
We have heard in this Chamber and
around this country that the quality of
the Federal bench and the capabilities
and the experience and the values and
the judgment of those who serve on
Federal benches across this country is
an absolutely essential piece of our
Constitution and our ordered liberty.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6876 December 5, 2019
The cases that come before Federal
courts are too important to tolerate in-
competence, inexperience, or bias in
the Federal judiciary.
Why does this matter both in terms
of the process and the substance? The
President has put forward nominees
who, in my view, would take us back-
ward on civil rights and voting rights,
on women’s access to healthcare, on
laws that protect consumers and work-
ers, and on the environment. Their de-
cisions impact every American. Equal-
ly concerning is that Trump’s nomi-
nees don’t reflect the diversity of our
Nation. We want litigants to go into a
court and be able to have their day in
court and be confident that the judge
before them represents the breadth and
range of America.
So far, of the 55 circuit court nomi-
nees confirmed, only 11 have been
women, and they have been even less
racially diverse. Of all of President
Trump’s nominees, 87 percent are
White and 78 percent are men. I think
the judiciary should reflect the diver-
sity of the American people and have
strong records and a wealth of experi-
ence. Sadly, that is not the case for
several we have considered, and let me
briefly speak to two.
President Trump’s nominee to serve
on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,
who was recently confirmed, Lawrence
VanDyke, raised serious concerns
about his work ethic and his tempera-
ment. He was rated ‘‘not qualified’’ by
the ABA based on concerns about his
lack of knowledge of basic procedural
rules and his commitment to being
truthful. Six retired justices of the
Montana Supreme Court questioned his
fitness when he ran for the Supreme
Court in Montana and expressed con-
cerns about his partisanship and the
possibility of corporate influence. He is
opposed to basic civil rights and civil
liberties for the LGBTQ community
and made a range of statements that I
think would be disqualifying under any
circumstance.
Sarah Pitlyk, who this Senate just
confirmed this week to a lifetime seat
on the U.S. District Court for the East-
ern District of Missouri, has never
tried a case, either criminal or civil,
has never taken a deposition, has never
examined a witness, and has never ar-
gued a motion in Federal or State
court. The ABA unanimously rated her
as ‘‘unqualified’’ for a lifetime seat in
the Federal judiciary.
We can and we should do better than
this. Of the entire bar of the State of
Missouri, I am certain there are quali-
fied, capable, and seasoned conserv-
atives who could have been nominated
for that seat in the entire Ninth Cir-
cuit. In particular, the State for which
Mr. VanDyke was nominated, there are
certainly abundant opportunities to
choose qualified nominees. We can and
we should do better than this.
In my State of Delaware, my senior
Senator, TOM CARPER, and I worked to-
gether to help form a bipartisan judi-
cial nominating committee to fill two
vacancies on our district court. We felt
strongly we had to reach out to the
White House and work with them to
identify consensus nominees who would
be the best candidates we could best
support and whom the President could
nominate. Ultimately, we had a very
productive process, and the President
nominated Maryellen Noreika and
Colm Connolly, whom we both returned
positive blue slips for. They ultimately
have been confirmed by this Senate,
seated, and now serve in our district
court. This is how the process should
work.
We should be able to consult back
and forth between the executive and
legislative until we find competent, ca-
pable, and qualified judges of whom we
can all be proud of. The Senate should
not be a rubberstamp for this adminis-
tration, regardless of the quality of
nominees that get sent forward.
I will continue to oppose President
Trump’s nominees who are undeserving
of a seat on the Federal bench and un-
qualified to serve. It is, in my view, our
responsibility to guard against the
politicization of the Federal judiciary,
and we should work together, not to
tear down and destroy the traditions
and rules of this Senate but to find
ways to strengthen and sustain them.
That is how we will move qualified and
consensus nominees forward and pro-
tect the independent judiciary on
which our very democracy rests.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order

TRIBUTE TO JOHNNY ISAKSON
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I
come to the floor today because I
missed an important occasion in the
Senate. We had a celebration recently
of one of our more beloved Members,
Senator JOHNNY ISAKSON of Georgia.
There wasn’t much that could keep
me away from that, but there was no
Senator going to Madrid to the con-
ference of the parties to consider the
Paris Climate Agreement. Speaker
PELOSI asked me to come on her House
delegation so that it was bicameral. As
I think most people in this body know,
I am pretty animated on that subject
and couldn’t say no. There are not
many other things that could have
kept me away.
I want to come now and make up a
little bit for being absent that day and
express my gratitude for JOHNNY’s
friendship to me over the years. I had
the pleasure of going with him to the
D-day anniversary on a codel that he
led with his usual graciousness and pa-
triotism. He was kind enough to join
quite early on the bipartisan Senate
Oceans Caucus I started and has been a
very helpful part of that endeavor.
We have worked together on ways to
improve healthcare planning for people
who are in the late stage of illness to
make sure that they get the care that
they want and don’t get a lot of care
that they don’t want and so that they
have a chance to have their dignity and
desire to be at home respected.
We have long been adherent of a bien-
nial budget, and I am delighted that
the bipartisan bill that Senator ENZI
and I have put together will create a
biennial budget. I am not sure we will
be able to get that done before Senator
ISAKSON leaves, but one way or the
other, his interest in biennial budg-
eting will live on, I hope, successfully
when we pass that.
We had a parity question about chil-
dren’s mental health hospitals that
weren’t getting counted and, therefore,
weren’t getting access to funding for
the medical interns who come, and
JOHNNY helped me fix that. It helped, I
am sure, hospitals in Georgia, but it
was particularly helpful to me for our
Children’s Hospital in Rhode Island.
We have a lot of Rhode Islanders who
were killed in the Lebanon Marine bar-
racks bombing, and there has been liti-
gation against Iran for its responsi-
bility for those deaths. It is not easy to
collect a judgment on a foreign govern-
ment, and JOHNNY has been very help-
ful to me in our joint efforts on Iran
terror victims’ judgments, helping us
let the lawyers collect against assets of
the Government of Iran.
Then, we regularly have done Na-
tional Mentoring Month resolutions to-
gether.
But for all the things we have done
together, that is not what I am going
to miss about Senator JOHNNY ISAKSON.
He is just one of the most decent, kind,
good people who I have come across
anywhere in my life and, certainly, one
of the most decent and kind Members
of the Senate.
With my very sincere apologies,
JOHNNY, for missing the correct day, I
hope you will understand how much it
mattered to me to be elsewhere and
why I had to be there. I come to the
floor now, belatedly, to wish you all
my very best with great affection and
great respect.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

5G
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last
week, of course, was Thanksgiving, a
day that we all set aside in America to
count our blessings. As we do that, we
always say to ourselves: Gee, we really
ought to be thankful every day of the
year for the many blessings that have
been bestowed upon us.
I know I say that to myself. So I
thought today, for a few minutes, I
would mention two things that I am es-
pecially thankful for, even though this
isn’t Thanksgiving, but it is another
day that the Lord has blessed us with.
The first thing—and there are many
things that I am thankful for, but the
first thing I am thankful for that I
want to mention today is the many
public servants who care for and pro-
tect American taxpayer money.
I want to highlight one in particular:
the Chairman of our FCC, Mr. Ajit Pai.
Let me explain why I am thankful for
this public servant—one among many
who get up every day and work hard to
protect taxpayer money. About 2 weeks
ago, the Chairman of the FCC, over
many obstacles, announced that he was
going to hold a public auction for the
C-band.
Why is that important?
We all have a cell phone now, and
many of us have iPads and computers.
The internet has changed our world
and changed our lives. It has made it
more complicated, of course, but on
balance, I think the internet has been
good for our lives.
We are about to move into a new
phase of telecommunications called 5G.
It stands for fifth generation. It is real-
ly an extraordinarily fast internet. It
can carry huge amounts of data. The
ingenuity of the American people takes
my breath away.
I am pretty impressed with 4G, and
5G is going to be 100 times faster. It is
going to make things possible like tele-
medicine, where a specialist in a field
of surgery through robotics and now an
incredibly fast internet can operate on
a sick patient 1,000 miles away and
save his or her life, thanks to 5G. We
will be able to hook up all of our de-
vices through 5G, saving time. It will
give us more precious time to spend
with our family. There will be driver-
less cars. Maybe I will not see them in
my lifetime, but our assistants and our
pages in the Senate will see them in
their lifetime.
I could go on, but the point is, to
make 5G possible, a lot of people have
to work together. So 5G is made pos-
sible through the airwaves. When inter-
net devices talk to each other, data in
the form of radio waves—the scientists
call them electromagnetic radiation—
these radio waves go through the air-
waves from one device to another.
We have all sorts of different air-
waves. It is called spectrum. We have
airwaves for radios and TVs. Well, 5G
can be used in a number of different
airwaves or different parts of the spec-
trum. But one part of the spectrum,
one part of the airwaves, is just perfect
for 5G. It is called the C-band. That
part of the airwaves is able to carry
these 5G radio waves in a manner that
can cover a huge geographical area but
also carry lots of data.
It is called the C-band, and it is per-
fect for 5G. It is perfect. It is not too
hot, not too cold. It is just right.
Some swamp creatures, both in gov-
ernment and out, came that close—
that close—to getting control of the C-
band, which is owned by the American
people. Led by three foreign satellite
companies, they had almost convinced
the powers that be to give them the C-
band—just give it to them—and let
them decide who is going to get to use
that C-band for 5G.
Oh, and, by the way, in picking the
telecommunication companies that
would get to use the C-band that was
going to be given to them for free by
the powers that be, these foreign com-
panies were going to get to keep the
money—about $60 billion. That is just
the upfront money—$60 billion. That
would build 7,000 miles of interstate in
this country.
Not only would the companies get
the $60 billion, they would get to decide
who could use the C-band, and they
were that close. But the Chairman of
the FCC stopped it. He is going to rec-
ommend next week—and I hope the
rest of the FCC goes along with it. I am
going to be there to watch. He rec-
ommended and is going to recommend
that we have a public auction.
Doing a public auction is nothing
new for the FCC. The FCC auctions off
different airwaves all the time. In fact,
the FCC in the last 25 years has held
right around 100—I think it is 93—pub-
lic auctions where anybody who wants
to, any company that wants to—com-
petition, moral good—can come in and
bid on that part of the airwaves.
The good people at the FCC have
brought in to the American taxpayer
about $123 billion in the last 25 years
by auctioning off these airwaves and
giving everybody a fair chance in a
fully transparent way in front of God
and country. That is the way it ought
to be.
But a lot of swamp creatures were
pushing hard for this private sale. The
American taxpayer not only would
have lost $60 billion, they would have
lost control of the C-band, which, ac-
cording to the Communications Act,
doesn’t belong to me, doesn’t belong to
the businesses; it belongs to the Amer-
ican people.
We can’t let our guard down. I have
learned in my short 3 years here that
those swamp creatures—if they can’t
get in the front door, they are going to
try the side door, and if they can’t
make it through the side door, they are
going to try the back door. We have a
lot of money at stake here, so we have
to remain vigilant.
I want to thank Ajit Pai for standing
up. He made the right people mad.

That is easy to talk about, but it is
hard to do. It takes courage, and he did
it, and I wanted to single him out.
The second thing I want to say I am
thankful for, among so many things, is
this: I am so thankful for our neighbors
to the North—Canada. I have visited
Canada so many times. I am so proud
to call them friends. There are 37 mil-
lion people in Canada, some of the fin-
est people that God ever put breath in.
We have fought together in wars. We
have fought for freedom that we all
take for granted. We trade with each
other. I mean, the country is just a
wonderful country with extraordinarily
friendly, decent, and God-fearing peo-
ple.
Our leaders squabble sometimes.
That is just the way life is. Sometimes
good friends have disagreements. We
are having a few little disagreements
right now. But on this beautiful Thurs-
day, I just wanted to come and say how
thankful I am that Canada is our friend
and how honored I am to call them
friends and how grateful I am for all 37
million of the fine men, women, and
children in that great country.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

WORLD BANK
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I
come to the floor this afternoon to dis-
cuss two issues: one dealing with the
World Bank and another one dealing
with the Department of Defense’s in-
ability to get clean audits.
Today the World Bank is releasing
its country partnership framework
with China. Reportedly, this includes
$1 billion to $1.5 billion of loans to
China per year and $800 million to $1
billion in private sector investment.
Keep in mind that the World Bank
was created to help economic develop-
ment in the world’s poorest countries.
China is now the world’s second largest
economy after the United States. Also,
the United States is the World Bank’s
largest contributor. I think many
Americans would question why so
many American tax dollars are going
to support low-interest loans in China.
In China, there is a large and growing
body of evidence of human rights
abuses in Xinxiang, including mass in-
ternment camps. Reports indicate that
these camps are centers for social con-
trol and political indoctrination. Chi-
nese authorities reportedly mistreat or
even torture detainees, while requiring
them to engage in forced labor and to
renounce their religion and their cul-
ture. Yet the World Bank has sup-
ported a program called Technical and
Vocational Education and Training
Project in Xinxiang Province.
This is wording very close to what
the Chinese Communist Party
euphemistically calls its internment
camps. Plus, one reporter has uncov-
ered documents that these schools pur-
chased barbwire, tear gas, and body
armor using other funds—and, of
course, funds are fungible.
Institutions like the World Bank
have a great responsibility to further
assess critical human rights risk and
religious freedom, such as those exhib-
ited in Xinxiang in any region where it
lends money.
The World Bank’s own social frame-
work standards state that when assess-
ing social risk and impacts, the Bank
must assess threats to human security
and impacts on the health, safety, and
well-being of workers and project-af-
fected communities. The Bank and
other such institutions cannot ade-
quately assess a project’s full impact
without monitoring and examining re-
ports of widespread human rights
abuses in any local area.
On November 16, the New York Times
published leaked Chinese records indi-
cating a coordinated effort going back
years, directed by General Secretary
Xi, to detain hundreds of thousands of
Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslims
in internment camps and to unleash
the tools of ‘‘dictatorship’’ on the
Xinxiang Muslim population. Given
these repeated reports about repression
in Xinxiang that date back even years,
it is hard to see how any project in
that region could meet the Bank’s so-
cial framework standards. There needs
to be a periodic internal review of risk
assessment mechanisms to ensure that
they are appropriately calibrated to
capture changing risk profiles.
I question whether the Bank’s over-
sight processes are adequate, given its
own assessments saw no issue with
these intern camps that go by the pro-
fessional name of Technical and Voca-
tional Education and Training
Project—and I am referring particu-
larly to those in Xinxiang Province.
In a statement on August 29, the
World Bank stated that it had con-
ducted supervision missions twice a
year since the project started and that
these missions included a review of so-
cial safeguards and a monitoring and
evaluation review. The World Bank
found ‘‘no evidence from subsequent re-
views that funds were diverted, mis-
used, or used for activities not in line
with project objectives or World Bank
policies and procedures.’’
However, just last month, the Bank
raised the environmental and social
risk ratings from moderate—the second
lowest level—to substantial and then
to high—the highest level. It is very
disappointing that very little happened
in upgrading the risk assessments on
this project until after congressional
attention, even with an internal whis-
tleblower raising the matter. This
seems like a failed process to me when
routine audits and a whistleblower
complaint do not catch anything, de-
spite increasingly concerning reports
in the media about mistreatment and
abuse.
I have written a letter to the Bank
President, Malpass, asking questions
about these systemic concerns. More-
over, I questioned why a country like
China, whose economy has far sur-
passed the threshold at which it is sup-
posed to graduate from rural bank
funding, is now and forever still taking
loans.
The World Bank was created for a
very worthwhile purpose—to help poor
countries that cannot, on their own ef-
forts, assess capital markets.
Both China and Russia today have
well surpassed the World Bank’s grad-
uation threshold and have access to
capital markets. Yet American tax-
payers are called on to do more. Yet
China then continues to borrow, on av-
erage, $2 billion a year from the World
Bank, making it one of the Bank’s top
borrowers—the second largest economy
in the world and one of the Bank’s top
borrowers.
Countries like China or Russia that
have seen the most economic progress
should not seek to maintain access to
the Bank’s preferential lending rates
and technical support. Moreover, these
are our two major geopolitical foes.
I have previously highlighted China’s
intellectual property theft and foreign
influence activities at American uni-
versities as just an example of other
things I looked at in the case of China.
Russia’s illegal occupation of terri-
tory in Georgia and Ukraine and its
‘‘active measures’’ against democ-
racies, including the U.S. democracy,
make it effectively an outlawed state.
Meanwhile, China does substantial for-
eign lending of its own, which it uses
as a tool of geopolitical influence over
other countries.
Now, just think, through the World
Bank, they get U.S. taxpayer dollars,
and then the country is still so rich
that they can lend to many other na-
tions around the world to increase the
geopolitical influence of China, and
that country’s lending does not follow
international development finance
standards, nor does China disclose the
amounts or terms for loans that it of-
fers.

debt sustainability in recipient coun-

countries, and then they have an agree-
ment that if the loan isn’t paid, then
China takes over, enhancing their in-
fluence—a lot of it for military pur-
poses.
A March 2018 report from the Center
for Global Development assessed the
current debt vulnerabilities of the
countries I just referred to, identified

sustainability problems, and where
China is a dominant creditor in the key
position to address these problems.’’
The World Bank, again using Amer-
ican tax dollars, should not be lending
to wealthy countries that violate the
human rights of their citizens and at-
tempt to dominate weaker countries
through their loans, whether it is done
for military reasons or for economic
reasons.
The State-Foreign Operations appro-
priations bill contains funding and au-
thorization for a large capital increase
for the World Bank. In other words,
what I just said—the Senate is going to
be facing this issue. I have developed
an amendment to this bill that would
insert language requiring the U.S. rep-
resentative to the World Bank to work
to defeat any project in a country that
has reached the World Bank’s own
‘‘graduation threshold’’ and, secondly,
that is designated by the State Depart-
ment as a ‘‘country of particular con-
cern for religious freedom’’ or is on the
watch list for such designation. Both of
those would include China and Russia
at this point. Countries with broadly
documented violations of international
norms, human rights, and religious
freedoms should not be given the privi-
lege of accessing preferential loans
that then limit access to other coun-
tries in need.
In other words, the second largest
economy in the world—China—by get-
ting loans from the World Bank at the
same time they violate the human
rights of their people—developing
countries that need the loans and re-
sources are not getting them because
they are going to the wealthy nations.
DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. President, now to my second and
last issue of the day, I want to report
on the Pentagon’s most recent audit.
Unfortunately, I don’t come with tid-
ings of comfort and joy. Instead, I
come with tidings of bad news. The De-
partment of Defense has flunked an-
other test of fiscal fitness yet again.
Last year, Congress authorized more
than $700 billion for the Department of
Defense. That is a heck of a lot of
money. That is why it is a big deal that
the Pentagon is unable to account for
the hundreds of billions of taxpayer
dollars it spends from one year to the
next year.
Every dollar that Congress approves
for the Defense Department is crucial
for our national security. We must en-
sure that America’s sons and daughters
in uniform are well paid and well
equipped to defend our great country.
That is why I work tirelessly to hold
the Pentagon accountable.
The good news is, I am Iowa-stub-
born. As a taxpayer watchdog, I won’t
let go of this bone until I see results.
There is always bad news after you
announce good news, so the bad news is
that the Pentagon’s books are a big fis-
cal mess. In fact, the Defense Depart-
ment is the very last Federal agency to
comply with a Federal law—decades
old—requiring an annual audit.
It took 28 years after Congress en-
acted a law requiring every Federal
agency to conduct an annual audit for
the Pentagon to get its ducks in a row.
Unfortunately, the results are not what
they are quacked up to be.
As required by the 1990 Chief Finan-
cial Officers Act, the bean counters at
the Department of Defense disclosed
their financial assessments for fiscal
year 2019 to the Office of Inspector
General, and then the IG deployed 1,400
auditors to 600 sites around the world.
These 1,400 auditors at 600 different
sites surveyed $2.9 trillion in assets and
tallied $2.8 trillion in liabilities. After
spending $1 billion to conduct this
audit, the Department of Defense in-
spector general was unable to issue a
clean opinion, and that is the goal we
seek.
Just like other Departments can get
clean opinions, why can’t the Defense
Department do so? The case is that
year after year, the Pentagon is unable
to account for tax dollars coming in
and tax dollars going out.
Let me clarify for everyone listening
just what happens when big spenders
aren’t held accountable. Tax dollars
are ripe for wrongdoers to harvest, and
in the sprawling bureaucracy that we
call the Defense Department, with
bases and contractors stationed around
the globe, Pentagon spending is vulner-
able to waste, fraud, and abuse.
As a Pentagon watchdog, I have ap-
proached this podium nearly 50 times
over my years of service here in the
Senate to continually call attention to
this wasteful spending by the Depart-
ment of Defense. At the same time, I
haven’t avoided calling attention to
wasteful spending in any agency of the
Federal Government, but the Depart-
ment of Defense has gotten the major-
ity of my attention. During this period
of time, I have written countless over-
sight letters and launched scores of in-
vestigations. I have encouraged my col-
leagues to ramp up their oversight
work so we can work together to fix
what is broken.
The top dogs at the Pentagon have
undertaken countless reform efforts, so
I am not saying they don’t recognize it
and try to do something about it, but
after all these decades, they have not
succeeded.
At the same time, besides under-
taking countless reform efforts, they
have issued endless promises. They
have testified that real solutions are
underway. Yet the results of the fiscal
2019 audit leaves this Iowa Senator
underwhelmed. Tax dollars are still
leaking through the Pentagon ledgers
like a sieve. The plumbing is broken.
When the fiscal faucets are cranked
wide open, at full throttle, with no in-
ternal controls welded in place to pre-
vent leaking, tax dollars are flushed
down the drain.
Over many years of oversight, dozens
of top dogs at the Defense Department
and the top brass of U.S. military have
come to my office to offer explanations
for wasteful spending, particularly
after the Pentagon is on the receiving
end of unflattering headlines. They
have polished their skills when it
comes to dodging tough questions
posed by my oversight letters. They
are also well prepared to rationalize
hundreds of billions of dollars for their
budget.
It is entirely reasonable and the re-
sponsibility of each of our lawmakers,
including this one, to expect that they
also have the ability to show us where
the money goes. I have approached dia-
logue with our Nation’s military lead-
ers in good faith, but time and again, I
have been disappointed. The Defense
Department’s inability or unwilling-
ness to make necessary and overdue
changes is quite unacceptable. The
buck stops here, of course. As rep-
resentatives of the American people,
we owe it to our constituents.
The Defense Department is the larg-
est Federal agency. Over time, bureau-
crats get wrapped up in a culture of go
along to get along. Some insiders take
the brave step to blow the whistle on
waste, fraud, and abuse; however, many
are afraid to follow suit. That is why it
is so important to inject a dose of re-
ality into that swamp.
What is really needed is a massive
transfusion to change the mindset. We
have a lot of history, so let me remind
my colleagues, Washington is an island
surrounded by reality, and when it
comes to fiscal responsibility, the Pen-
tagon operates on its own special fan-
tasy island. That is why Congress can’t
rubberstamp the Defense Department’s
budget with no accountability for how
the money is spent.
Every time a new defense authoriza-
tion funding bill is due in Congress,
military leaders speak to the ever-
changing threats facing our country.
Those same military leaders plead for
additional funding to defend our Na-
tion, fight our enemies, and protect our
interests abroad. Those military lead-
ers discuss the growing threat of cyber
attacks, aging and obsolete equipment,
and say that cuts to their budget would
hurt our men and women in uniform.
National defense, as we all know, is
the No. 1 priority of the Federal Gov-
ernment under the Constitution, so
Congress is understandably reluctant
to deny money that military leaders
say they need. That, in turn, is the rea-
son earning a clean audit is shoved to
the back burner at the Defense Depart-
ment.
Congress and the Pentagon need to
reach an understanding. Fiscal ac-
countability and military readiness are
not mutually exclusive. It is not an ei-
ther/or scenario. Earning a clean bill of
fiscal health would strengthen military
readiness and boost support for nec-
essary increases to defense spending in
Congress and among the American peo-
ple.
Money somehow seems to simply get
lost at the Defense Department. It is
unreasonable to concede that it is OK
for military inventory to vanish into
thin air. It boils down to sloppy book-
keeping and antiquated accounting

December 5, 2019
systems that can’t generate reliable
transaction data.
The problem starts at the top and fil-
ters down throughout the five quarters
of the Pentagon. Let’s consider the re-
cent debacle with the TransDigm
Group. In February, the Defense De-
partment’s Office of Inspector General
released a report on spare parts that
the Pentagon purchased from
TransDigm. The result of that report
exposed the rinse-and-repeat fiscal she-
nanigans corroding the accounting sys-
tems at the Pentagon. In the report,
the IG analyzed 113 contracts between
January 2015 and January 2017. It re-
viewed 47 spare parts the Defense De-
partment purchased from TransDigm.
In that window of time of only 2 years,
TransDigm overcharged the Defense
Department by more than $16 million.
I will go out on a limb and suggest
that Americans would rather spend $16
million for the Defense Department on
our men and women in uniform rather
than overpaying for spare parts rip-offs
to a defense contractor.
Congress can’t sign blank checks to
the Defense Department. We must
work to ensure every dollar is present
and accounted for. The Nation’s
strongest military in the world is man-
aged by a Defense Department where
taxpayer dollars seem to vanish with-
out explanation, without receipts, and
without accountability. Over the years,
I have collected a laundry list of Pen-
tagon waste, fraud, and abuse from $436
hammers to $640 toilet seats, $117 soap
dish covers, and $999 pliers. Most re-
cently, I have exposed $1,200 reheatable
coffee cups and $14,000 toilet seat lids.
The dirty laundry just keeps piling up,
and at the same time it is piling up, it
is soaking the taxpayer.
These wasteful expenditures rep-
resent just the tip of an iceberg. The
simple truth is the Defense Depart-
ment can’t keep track of or doesn’t
seem to care where tax dollars are
spent. Internal controls are weak and,
in some cases, nonexistent. That has
been reinforced by this second audit for
which the Department of Defense in-
spector general can’t give a clean
audit.
For a second time, I would suggest
that what the law of 28 years ago tries
to accomplish is that every Depart-
ment get a clean audit—a clean opinion
on their audit. Let me repeat for a sec-
ond time that the Defense Department
is the only agency of the Federal Gov-
ernment that can’t do that. The De-
fense Department, repeating again, is
the only agency that hasn’t been able
to deliver a clean audit, despite spend-
ing billions of dollars to modernize its
accounting system. All of that invest-
ment hasn’t produced better systems.
No one except me and a few others
ever talk about this, but it needs to be
talked about and talked about a lot
more, and it needs to be talked about
in a deliberate way and very often.
Congress can’t allow the Defense De-
partment to sweep this issue under the
rug year after year.
The TransDigm fiasco is just one
very small example, even though it
cost the taxpayers a lot of wasted dol-
lars. Price gouging has been going on
for years at the expense of the tax-
payer and military readiness. Top-level
managers know all about what I am
talking about, but they aren’t doing a
doggone thing to fix it. People must be
held accountable for missing receipts,
for lost financial information, for
wasteful spending approvals, for ques-
tionable contracting agreements, and
every other abuse of power that leads
to more taxpayer dollars being squan-
dered.
American households across the
country scrutinize their spending and
keep tabs on their bills. The Defense
Department should approach spending
no differently. That is why I pushed for
an amendment to the latest Defense
authorization bill that would have re-
quired the Pentagon to keep better
track of its contracts and to make sure
they do make reports to the Congress.
While this amendment was ultimately
not included in the bill, I want my col-
leagues to know that I am going to
continue to push for more account-
ability.
Throughout my years of oversight,
the Pentagon officials have claimed
they want to reverse the cycle of cost
overruns; they want to clean up their
books; and they want to hold people re-
sponsible. Yet it never seems to hap-
pen. Although I am encouraged by the
conversations I have had so far with
new Defense Secretary Esper, the proof
is in the pudding. From one adminis-
tration to the next, it has been the
same story. Business goes on as usual.
From the top of the chain of com-
mand to the rank and file, there is a
pervasive mindset that assumes no one
is watching over them and that no one
cares. For four decades, this Senator
has been watching, and this Senator
cares. I am disgusted each time I dis-
cover another example of wasteful
spending.
So I am here this very day, as I have
been dozens of times before in my serv-
ice in the Senate, to ask my colleagues
in both the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in a crusade to
stop wasteful spending at the Defense
Department. There is a saying that
goes something like this: no guts, no
glory. Well, wasteful spending is gut-
ting our military readiness and goring
the taxpayers. There is no glory in
that, and people might wonder then,
why does this Senator bother?
I have fought fiscal mismanagement
at the Defense Department for these
many decades. I have launched inves-
tigation after investigation and come
to the floor of the Senate to talk until
I am blue in the face. Billions of dol-
lars have been poured into a decades-
long effort to right the fiscal ship at
the Defense Department. The Pentagon
has shelled out billions for several hun-
dred partial orders, two complete au-
dits, and endless technology updates to
modernize its IT and accounting sys-
tems. Yet no one can tell us when, if
ever, a clean audit might be possible.
How can that be? After nearly 30 years
of effort, there is no solution.
The Department of Defense can de-
velop the most advanced weapons sys-
tems in the world, but it can’t seem to
deploy something as simple and com-
mon as an accounting system that is
capable of capturing payment trans-
actions and generating reliable fiscal
and financial data. That is why it is a
cakewalk for crooks to rip into the
Pentagon’s money sack from both ends
and use a front end loader to freeload
their way through this money pit.
Without a clean audit on the foresee-
able horizon, there is no evidence to
catch anyone’s hands in the Pentagon
cookie jar. The only way we will root
out fraud and wasteful spending is by
knowing where the money is being
spent.
That brings me back to square one as
I finish. We need a clean audit and a re-
liable accounting system. As I men-
tioned earlier, I am Iowa stubborn,
and, by God, I am willing to work with
my colleagues and go toe-to-toe with
any administration, Republican or
Democrat. I will work as long as it
takes for us to see eye to eye to hold
the Defense Department accountable
once and for all.
I yield the floor.

UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to
commemorate the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate
Change 25th Conference of the Parties,
or COP25, which is taking place in Ma-
drid until December 12 this year. I do
so despite the cloud cast by President
Trump’s announcement of his inten-
tion to withdraw the United States
from the Paris Agreement.
The Paris Agreement is a landmark
effort to reduce global greenhouse gas
emissions in an effort to limit the glob-
al temperature increase in this century
to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial
levels while pursuing means to limit
the increase to 1.5 degrees.
The COP meetings now routinely rep-
resent the largest multilateral diplo-
matic events in the world. This year’s
conference is designed to take the next
critical steps in the U.N. climate
change process. Following agreements
on the implementation guidelines of
the Paris Agreement COP24 in Poland
last year, a key objective is to com-
plete several matters with respect to
the full operationalization of the Paris
climate change agreement.
Article 28 of the Paris Agreement
specifies that after joining, no country
can withdraw for 3 years, after which a
1-year waiting period must occur be-
fore withdrawal takes effect. The
Trump administration recklessly filed
withdrawal documents on November 4,
2019, making November 4, 2020, the ear-
liest possible date the United States
can be out of the agreement.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6882 December 5, 2019
Withdrawal could not come at a cost-
lier time. In an analysis I requested to
review the Federal approach to
prioritizing and funding climate resil-
ience projects that address the Na-
tion’s most significant climate risks,
the Government Accountability Office
notes that there were at least 14 disas-
ters whose costs exceeded $1 billion
each in 2018 alone.
GAO, an independent, nonpartisan
agency that examines how taxpayer
dollars are spent and is known as the
congressional watchdog, reported that
the total estimated costs reached at
least $91 billion in damage to public
and private property.
‘‘The cost of recent weather disasters
has illustrated the need to plan for cli-
mate change risks and invest in cli-
mate resilience,’’ the report says. ‘‘In-
vesting in climate resilience can re-
duce the need for far more costly steps
in the decades to come.’’
The Paris Agreement establishes a
global goal on adaptation that consists
of, one, enhancing adaptation capacity;
two, strengthening resilience; and
three, reducing vulnerability to cli-
mate change in the context of the tem-
perature goal of the agreement. It aims
at strengthening the national adapta-
tion efforts, including through support
and international cooperation. It rec-
ognizes that adaptation is a global
challenge faced by all, including the
United States.
Because U.S. withdrawal will not for-
mally take effect until November 4,
2020, the U.S. team’s posture at COP25
remains largely unchanged. A group of
dedicated career civil servants will be
on the ground.
Moreover, 2 years ago, numerous U.S.
States, cities, Tribal nations, busi-
nesses, faith groups, universities, and
others enhanced their presence at
major international events, including
COP meetings, to maintain and encour-
age American progress toward its na-
tional climate goals.
I am proud that nearly 100 Maryland
pledgers ‘‘Are Still In.’’ They comprise
dozens of businesses—many small. We
have over 10 cities, 6 counties, cultural
institutions, faith and healthcare orga-
nizations, 20 universities, including my
alma mater, the University of Mary-
land School of Law in Baltimore, and
investors, such as the State treasurer
of Maryland. They are all still in.
Members of the Senate ‘‘Are Still
In.’’ I am proud to be leading 38 of my
colleagues in S. Res. 404. This bipar-
tisan resolution expresses the sense of
the Senate that the United States
should be working in cooperation with
the international community in con-
tinuing to exercise global leadership to
address the causes and effects of cli-
mate change.
Prior to that, I led a congressional
delegation of 10 Senators to COP21 that
produced the Paris Agreement in 2015.
Then the United States committed to
lowering its contribution of greenhouse
gas emissions 26 to 28 percent below
2005 levels by 2025.
Business and labor ‘‘are still in.’’ In a
recent letter, 75 major CEOs and orga-
nized labor that are represented by the
AFL–CIO stressed the importance of
the Paris Agreement and the need for
the United States to remain in it. This
represents one of the most powerful
recognitions ever from the private sec-
tor of the economic risks and opportu-
nities that climate change presents to
the United States and the world. The
December 2, 2019, Joint Labor Union
and CEO Statement on the Paris
Agreement comprises a group of CEOs
who employ more than 2 million people
in the United States and union leaders
who represent more than 12.5 million
workers.
In 2009, at the Copenhagen COP 15,
the U.S. helped to drive the creation of
goals for developed nations to mobilize
$100 billion in public and private cli-
mate finance in 2020. The result was
the Green Climate Fund, which helps
to fund climate finance investment in
low emissions, climate-resilient devel-
opment.
The Paris Agreement affirmed and
extended that $100 billion goal. Al-
though President Trump has stymied
its funding, the fiscal year 2020 State
Department and Foreign Operations
bill the Senate Committee on Appro-
priations reported is the most favor-
able, forward-leaning on multilateral
climate assistance in years, funding re-
newable energy programs at $179 mil-
lion and resiliency programs at $177
million. In addition, the bill commits
$140 million to the Global Environ-
mental Facility and $10 million to the
U.N. climate convention.
We must not forget the cooperation
President Trump would have us forget.
On a bipartisan basis, the U.S. Con-
gress has uniformly rejected the Presi-
dent’s repeated calls to zero out cli-
mate assistance funding. This rebuke
represents the true, cooperative spirit
of our country, once a global leader on
climate issues.
I urge President Trump to reassert
our Nation’s strong leadership in im-
plementing the Paris Agreement before
the next Conference of the Parties. In
the meantime, I applaud the courage of
the general public, universities, faith-
based groups, nonprofits, labor organi-
zations, private sector companies, and
State and local governments that have
helped to step into the void President
Trump created by his withdrawal from
this agreement.
I yield the floor.

UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise
to discuss the need to pass the United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
It is frustrating that we have to con-
tinue to speak about this issue. We
have been so close for a long time now,
but the lack of action on the part of
the House leadership continues to un-
necessarily delay its ratification.
Our neighbors to the north and south
are our natural allies and trading part-
ners; yet our trade policy with them
has not been updated in 25 years. The
President and his team have worked
very hard to get Canada and Mexico to
the negotiating table to modernize our
trade agreement in a mutually bene-
ficial manner. That hard work has paid
off in the form of the USMCA. It is
ready for ratification, and the Senate
is eager to get that done.
Unfortunately, we are at the mercy
of the House, which must act first. The
House leadership’s refusal to move this
trade deal is preventing additional job
creation in our country, and it is send-
ing the wrong signal to our trading
partners across the globe. We ought to
be spurring economic activity by strik-
ing fair trade agreements globally, not
sitting on our hands and refusing to ap-
prove an agreement between two of our
top trading partners.
A fair and mutually beneficial trade
agreement with our neighbors to the
north and south is very important to
my home State of Arkansas. Canada
and Mexico are No. 1 and No. 2 on the
list of the top 10 destinations for Ar-
kansas’ exports. Arkansas is one of a
handful of States that in recent years
has consistently exported more than
what it has imported from Canada and
Mexico.
The World Trade Center Arkansas,
which has played a valuable role in
connecting businesses in my State with
international partners for over a dec-
ade, recently released a report that
summarizes trade and jobs data for the
Natural State.
The center’s report underscores the
value trade brings to my State’s econ-
omy and reinforces the fact that the
path to a more prosperous, long-term
outlook for Arkansas is through open-
ing additional markets for our farmers,
manufacturers, and small businesses.
The report notes that, as of September
2019, trade in Arkansas supported near-
ly 350,000 jobs. This represents approxi-
mately 26 percent of the State’s total
employed labor force. It points to a di-
rect correlation between job numbers
and trade, documenting that trade-re-
lated jobs in the State have grown six
times faster than total employment
over the past few years.
More importantly, for our purposes
here today, the report underscores just
how crucial Canada and Mexico are for
Arkansas’ economy. The Natural
State’s exports to Canada amounted to
$1.2 billion last year. Our exports to
Mexico totaled $870 million in that
same time span. Combined, these two
countries account for a third of Arkan-
sas’ total exports. Nearly 69,000 jobs in
my State are dependent on trade with
Canada, and another 41,000 are tied to
trade with Mexico.
Melvin Torres, the center’s director
of Western Hemisphere and European
Trade, praised Arkansas’ effective part-
nership with both countries for cre-
ating this ‘‘symbiotic and successful
relationship.’’ That relationship will
only grow with the ratification of the
USMCA.

December 5, 2019
Canada and Mexico aren’t just impor-
tant markets for my State. Each of our
States stands to gain with the ratifica-
tion of the USMCA. This landmark
trade deal will create over 175,000 jobs,
which will help to strengthen our econ-
omy and America’s middle class. This
overdue modernization of NAFTA will
benefit workers in a wide array of in-
dustries. Manufacturing, tech, and
more stand to gain from the USMCA. It
will add much needed certainty for
farmers and ranchers, who currently
need every market they can get. Rural
America is struggling right now, and
approving this agreement will provide
a shot in the arm for the rural econ-
omy.
The ratification of the USMCA, along
with the recent deals that have been
struck with South Korea and Japan,
will show the rest of the world that the
U.S. is open for business. Proving that
the U.S. is negotiating in good faith to
reach mutually beneficial outcomes for
all parties that are involved could real-
ly move the needle in other ongoing
trade standoffs.
The House leadership needs to get on
the stick. The USMCA is too important
for our Nation’s economic future for it
to be sitting in limbo while House
Democrats focus on partisan goals.

October, the young women who make
up the Burlington High School girls
soccer team in Burlington, VT, made a
statement: The time for equal pay is
now. All they are looking for is for
their leaders—leaders like us in Con-
gress—to show the courage to make it
happen.
It all began one Friday night in Octo-
ber, when, after scoring a goal to put
them ahead in the closing minutes of a
game against neighboring rivals South
Burlington, four exuberant members of
the soccer team removed their jerseys
to reveal T-shirts emblazoned with this
simple phrase: ‘‘#EqualPay.’’
The reception to their silent state-
ment was reminiscent of that moment
when the U.S. Women’s National Team
made history in July, winning its sec-
ond consecutive World Cup title. After
a thrilling win over the Netherlands,
the stadium in France was filled with
chants of ‘‘Equal Pay! Equal Pay!’’.
One Friday in October, the stands—
though smaller—in Burlington, VT,
erupted in the same way. The result?
Yellow cards for the offending players,
issued by a referee bound by the rules
of the league.
The young women of the Burlington
High School soccer team became over-
night sensations. Within a matter of
days, they had sold more than 2,000 of
their now iconic simple white T-shirts,
raising more than $30,000 to support the
Greater Burlington Girls Soccer
League. Men were invited to pay an
extra $4 for the $25 T-shirt: 16 percent
of the cost, to represent the pay gender
pay gap in Vermont. Their story was
reported by local outlets like VTDigger
and the Burlington Free Press, and it
was featured on ‘‘Good Morning Amer-
ica’’ and on CNN. It even reached
across the pond, where the UK’s Daily
Mail featured the team’s advocacy. I
ask unanimous consent that the report
from VTDigger be printed in the
RECORD following these remarks.
The lesson here is simple, and the
voices could not be clearer: Equal pay
for equal work should not be controver-
sial, nor should it be challenged. Yet
today in Vermont, a woman makes
$0.84 for every $1 earned by a man. In
some States, the gap is as wide as 70
percent. It is inexplicable. It is inex-
cusable. And it needs to stop.
Marcelle and I are proud to support
the young women of the Burlington
High School soccer team. We proudly
wore our #EqualPay shirts outside the
U.S. Capitol, standing in solidarity
with these young Vermonters and with
women everywhere who are simply de-
manding what should be theirs: equal
pay for equal work.
Earlier this year, after the U.S.
Women’s National Team’s inspiring
victory at the World Cup, I reintro-
duced a simple resolution calling for
the Federation Internationale de Foot-
ball Association, FIFA, to immediately
eliminate gender pay inequity and
treat all athletes with the same respect
and dignity, regardless of gender. It is
straightforward. It is common sense.
And it is past due.
Following the October game, the ref-
eree who issued the yellow card bought
one of the team’s #EqualPay shirts for
himself. I find in that action a simple
metaphor: There is simply no longer
support for arcane practices that never
should have existed. We should heed
the call of the next generation and end
these discriminatory practices, not
just in sports but across the workforce.
Equal pay for equal work should be the
right of every person. It is as simple as
that.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:

BURLINGTON GIRLS SOCCER TEAM MAKES
WAVES WITH EQUAL PAY ACTIVISM
(By Aidan Quigley)
BURLINGTON.—When Burlington girls soc-
cer midfielder Helen Worden knocked in the
take-the-lead goal during the team’s Friday
night game against South Burlington with
under five minutes to play, her team burst
into a celebration.
Team members took the opportunity to
lift their jerseys up to reveal #equalpay T-
shirts underneath, with a few removing their
jerseys to show the full #equalpay shirts.
While four members of the teams received
yellow cards for removing their jerseys, the
celebration—and team’s efforts for gender
pay equality—went viral over the weekend,
with an appearance on ‘‘Good Morning Amer-
ica,’’ coverage on CNN and a slew of sup-
portive messages.
The team was inspired by the U.S. women’s
national soccer team’s campaign this sum-
mer during the World Cup. Members of the
national team filed a federal lawsuit alleging
gender discrimination against U.S. Soccer
which stated the women’s team generated
$20 million more in revenue than the men’s
team while earning a quarter of what the
men were paid.
Klara Martone, Burlington’s senior goalie,
said that the players were working hard in
school and wanted to bring attention to the
pay gap in society.
‘‘The idea that we could work this hard
and still make less money just based on our
gender is incredible to me,’’ Martone said.
‘‘We want to live in our adult lives in a world
where we don’t have to worry about making
less money.’’
The girls have sold 2,000 T-shirts and raised
a total of $30,000 as of Monday afternoon.
Worden went to France this summer and
witnessed the United States win the World
Cup. A chant after the win stuck with her.
‘‘People were cheering ‘equal pay,’ and it
was super inspiring,’’ Worden said. ‘‘So I
came back and talked to (my teammates)
about it, and said we should contribute in
some way.’’
Martone said that the team originally
planned on wearing ‘‘equal pay’’ T-shirts for
a dress-up day near the start of the season.
But the idea gained steam, and the team de-
cided to open up T-shirt orders to the com-
munity.
Junior right back Ruby Wool said at the
start, having the boys soccer team wear the
T-shirts was a ‘‘big victory’’ for the team.
‘‘Those small little steps we were taking
were so big to us, and with each thing every-
thing is getting bigger,’’ Wool said. ‘‘As of
right now, I don’t think it’s going to get
smaller for a while.’’
The team was ‘‘fuming’’ when they re-
ceived yellow cards at Friday’s game,
Worden said.
As four of the girls received yellow cards,
the crowd chanted ‘‘equal pay.’’
‘‘The good thing about the card was hear-
ing everybody had our back,’’ senior center
back/mid Maggie Barlow said. ‘‘That was one
of the moments we were like, ‘wow, we have
such a big support system.’ It was worth it
because that was amazing to hear.’’
Coach Jeff Hayes said some members of the
South Burlington team came over the ref-
erees and requested that they not card their
opponents. The cards were an exciting mo-
ment for the team, he said.
The four players who received yellow cards
had to be temporarily taken out of the game
and were not able to check back in before
South Burlington equalized minutes later.
The game ended in a 1–1 tie.
The effort was applauded by Brandi
Chastain, a longtime member of the U.S. na-
tional team who famously removed her jer-
sey in celebration of her penalty kick goal
which won the 1999 World Cup.
‘‘Thank you @bhsgirlssoccer for standing
up, celebrating and taking your jerseys off
for #equalpay Proud of you! #rolemodels,’’
Chastain tweeted Saturday.
Removing a jersey as part of a goal cele-
bration—a popular goal celebration—is an

automatic yellow card under the regulations
of FIFA, soccer’s worldwide governing body.
Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy tweeted a
photo of himself and his wife, Marcelle, both
wearing the #equalpay jerseys.
‘‘Marcelle and I stand with you!’’ Leahy
tweeted.
The team has worked with Change The
Story VT, a nonprofit initiative which works
to address the wage gap and advance eco-
nomic opportunities for women in the state.
Women in Vermont earn 84 cents to every
dollar earned by men, according to Change
the Story.
Jessica Nordhaus, director of strategy and
partnerships for Change the Story, said the
organization has been helping the team with
logistics and strategy. She said it has been a
good opportunity to talk to young people
about the wage gap, which isn’t on track to
close until 2048.
‘‘They’re doing the math and thinking,
‘How old will I be in 2048?’ ’’ Nordhaus said.
‘‘We’ve just been so thrilled to see them take
this issue on and do some of the activism
that raises awareness about pay inequity.’’
The team is selling the jerseys for $25, with
a looser fit ‘‘men’s’’ style jersey for $29.80.
The men’s jersey is 16% more expensive,
which is meant to even the wage gap.
The jerseys have #EqualPay on the front
with the BHS Seahorse logo and Change The
Story logos on the sleeves.
Funds raised in the sales will go to a local
youth soccer Greater Burlington Girls Soc-
cer League. The players are hoping the funds
raised can help with outreach across the city
and help make participants in the soccer
league more reflective of the demographics
of the city.
‘‘We want them to be able to give scholar-
ships to girls who aren’t able to play,’’ Bar-
low said. ‘‘We’re working on widening access
for all different kinds of people and making
sure GBGSL has the means to fund that.’’
The team finished its regular season with a
9–4–1 record, receiving the fourth seed in the
Division 1 playoffs. Burlington will face off
with 13th seed Brattleboro Wednesday in the
first round of the playoffs.
Hayes said he is excited for the playoffs
and that the activism is bringing the team
even closer together.
‘‘It just brought this team so together,’’
Hayes said. ‘‘They’re so cohesive when they
are using their voices. They’re making waves
in the community, and they’re good waves.’’
f
FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE
INTER-AMERICAN FOUNDATION
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for 50
years the Inter-American Foundation,
IAF, has partnered with grassroots or-
ganizations and underserved popu-
lations throughout Latin America and
the Caribbean to advance U.S. interests
by helping to improve the lives of the
hemisphere’s poorest people, sup-
porting civil society, and strength-
ening democratic institutions. I want
to take this opportunity today, on
IAF’s 50th anniversary, to comment
briefly on the foundation’s accomplish-
ments and on the unique value of
small-grant, community-led develop-
ment.
In 1969, Congress established IAF as
an independent development agency
charged with identifying and investing
in community-led development solu-
tions. IAF awards small grants, aver-
aging $280,000 over 4 years, directly to
local organizations, eliminating costly
intermediaries and ensuring programs
are led and implemented locally. IAF
also requires grantees to contribute or
mobilize their own cash or in-kind re-
sources, helping to ensure sustain-
ability and local investment in project
success. On average, such counterpart
investments mobilize $1.31 for every $1
invested by IAF.
According to IAF, in fiscal year 2019
alone, it awarded $18.5 million to 97
grassroots organizations in 24 coun-
tries and mobilized $20 million in
grantee counterpart resources. IAF
grantees created more than 2,500 part-
nerships with other organizations to
share experiences and advance their
missions, trained more than 200,000
people in new leadership and technical
skills, and contributed to the creation
of 11,000 new or improved jobs.
IAF’s development model illustrates
that if modest resources and technical
support are provided directly to com-
munities and their grassroots organiza-
tions so they can define their own
needs, design their own solutions, and
invest in their own communities, then
local ownership, self-reliance, and sus-
tainable development are possible.
IAF’s small-grants model also en-
ables it to be nimble and responsive to
changing conditions on the ground, in-
cluding natural and man-made disas-
ters. In recent years, IAF has used its
network of grantees in Brazil, Colom-
bia, Ecuador, and Peru to support thou-
sands of displaced Venezuelans and the
communities where they have relo-
cated.
After the signing of the Colombia
Peace Accords in 2016, IAF launched
the Colombian Peacebuilding Initiative
and invested nearly $2 million in 23
local Colombian organizations to sup-
port community-level peacebuilding
and reconciliation.
In Central America, IAF has 98
projects addressing the causes of mi-
gration in areas likely to be targets of
criminal gangs in order to help fami-
lies and communities resist such vio-
lence. And since June 2019, IAF has
awarded $650,000 in grants to civil soci-
ety organizations across the Eastern
Caribbean focused on strengthening
community-led disaster mitigation and
preparedness planning.
IAF’s successful approach to develop-
ment is why we increased funding in
the fiscal year 2020 State and Foreign
Operations Appropriations bill, which
was reported unanimously by the Ap-
propriations Committee in September.
Increased funding would enable IAF to
support a greater number of meri-
torious grant proposals, as the founda-
tion was able to fund only 7 percent of
the almost 800 proposals received in fis-
cal year 2019.
Regrettably, this model of donors di-
rectly supporting small-scale, local ini-
tiatives to design, implement, and sus-
tain their own development solutions
is more the exception than the rule. I
hope IAF’s 50th anniversary serves not
only as an opportunity to commemo-
rate its many accomplishments, but
also to reflect on the need to expand
IAF’s approach to development across
the U.S. Government.

following statement was ordered to be

TRANSMITTAL NO. 20–0A
Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensi-
tivity of Technology or Capability (Sec.
36(b)(5)(c), AECA)
(i) Purchaser: Government of Italy.
(ii) Sec. 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.:
08–60; Date: August 1, 2008; Military Depart-
ment: Air Force.
(iii) Description: On August 1, 2008, Con-
gress was notified by Congressional certifi-
cation transmittal number 08–60 of the pos-
sible sale, under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms
Export Control Act, of 4 MQ–9 Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAV), 3 Mobile Ground Con-
trol Stations, five years of maintenance sup-
port, engineering support, test equipment,
ground support, operational flight test sup-
port, communications equipment, technical
assistance, personnel training/equipment,
spare and repair parts, and other related ele-
ments of logistics support. These UAVs in-
cluded AN/DPY–1 Synthetic Aperture Radar/
Ground Moving Target Indicator (SAR/
GMTI) systems with 0.3 to 3 meter resolu-
tion. The estimated total cost was $330 mil-
lion. Major Defense Equipment (MDE) con-
stituted $50 million of this total.
On November 18, 2009, Congress was noti-
fied by Congressional certification trans-
mittal number 09–60 of the possible sale,
under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export
Control Act, of two unarmed MQ–9 Un-
manned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), one (1) Mo-
bile Ground Control Station, maintenance
support, engineering support, test equip-
ment, ground support, operational flight test
support, communications equipment, tech-
nical assistance, personnel training/equip-
ment, spare and repair parts, and other re-
lated elements of logistics support. These
UAVs included AN/DPY–1 Synthetic Aper-
ture Radar/Ground Moving Target Indicator
(SAR/GMTI) systems with 0.1 to 3 meter res-
olution. The estimated total cost was $63
million. MDE constituted $36 million of this
total.
On December 17, 2009, Congress was noti-
fied by Congressional certification trans-
mittal number 0C–09 of the possible sale,
under Section 36(b)(5)(a) of the Arms Export
Control Act, of a performance upgrade of the
AN/DPY–1 SAR/GMTI systems aboard the
four MQ–9s UAVs previously notified on
transmittal 08–60 from 0.3 to 3 meter resolu-
tion to the same 0.1 to 3 meter resolution of
the two MQ–9s notified on transmittal 09–60.
There was no increase in cost of MDE for
this upgrade.
This transmittal reports the addition of
Major Defense Equipment items beyond what
was originally notified to include:
1. Retrofit of five (5) existing MQ–9A Block
1 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to Block
5;
2. Retrofit of two (2) existing MGCS Block
30;
3. Addition of three (3) MQ–9A Block 5;
4. Addition of eight (8) Multi-Spectral Tar-
geting Systems (MTS–B) AN/DAS–1A;
5. Addition of eight (8) General Atomics
AN/APY–8 Lynx (exportable) Synthetic Aper-
ture Radar/Ground Moving Target Indicator
(SAR/GMTI) Systems, with Maritime Wide
Area Search (MWAS) capability;
6. Addition of two (2) Mobile Ground Con-
trol Station (MGCS) Block 30, and;
7. Addition of twenty-seven (27) Honeywell
H–764 Adaptive Configurable Embedded Glob-
al Positioning System/Inertial Guidance
Units (EGI) with Selective Availability Anti-
Spoofing Module (SAASM) (24 installed, 3
spares).
The retrofit, addition of aircraft, and in-
clusion of the above listed MDE not enumer-
ated in the previous notifications will result
in a net increase in MDE costs of $180 million
and non-MDE cost of $138 million. These no-
tifications represent the entirety of Italy’s
MQ–9 program, which will now increase in
value from $393 million to $711 million.
(iv) Significance: As Italy continues with
its plans to develop a robust MQ–9A fleet, it
has requested additional aircraft. Enhance-
ment of Italy’s MQ–9A aircraft will provide
strike capability to augment intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capa-
bility. The proposed sale increases Italy’s ca-
pability to participate in Europe and NATO
security operations and supports the foreign
and national security policies of the US by
enhancing the ISR and strike capability of a
major ally.
(v) Justification: Italy is a major political
and economic power in NATO and a key
democratic partner of the United States in
ensuring peace and stability around the
world. Italy requests these capabilities to
provide for the defense of deployed troops,
regional security, and interoperability with
the United States.
(vi) Sensitivity of Technology:
1. The MQ–9A Block 5 Unmanned Aerial
System (UAS) is UNCLASSIFIED. The high-
est level of classified information required
for training, operation, and maintenance is
SECRET. The MQ–9A Block 5 is a Medium
Altitude, long-endurance (MALE) remotely
piloted aircraft that can be used for surveil-
lance, military reconnaissance, and tar-
geting missions. Real-time missions are
flown under the control of a pilot in a
Ground Control Station (GCS). A datalink is
maintained that uplinks control commands
and downlinks video with telemetry data.
Line-of-Sight (LOS) communications is en-
abled through C-Band datalink and Beyond-
Line-of-Sight (BLOS) communications is en-
abled through Ku-Band Satellite Commu-
nication (SATCOM). Control of the aircraft
and payload are done through direct manual
inputs by the crew or through
preprogrammed mission. Preprogrammed
missions are planned and uploaded by the pi-
lots via the GCS and are executed through
the control of an onboard suite of redundant
computers and sensors. Payload imagery and
data are downlinked to the GCS. The pilot
may initiate pre-programmed missions once
the aircraft is airborne and lands the aircraft
when the mission is completed. Pilots can
change preprogrammed mission parameters
as often as required. When operated BLOS,
aircraft control is given to other strategi-
cally placed Ground Control Stations—per-
mitting remote split operations (RSO). The
MQ–9A Block 5 is designed to carry 850
pounds of internal payload with maximum
fuel and can carry multiple mission payloads
aloft. The MQ–9A Block 5 will be configured
for the following payloads: Electro-Optical/
Infrared (EO/IR), Synthetic Aperture Radar
(SAR), Electronic Support Measures (ESM),
Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), laser designa-
tors, and various weapons packages. The
MQ–9A Block 5 systems will include the fol-
lowing components:
a. The Ground Control Station (GCS) can
be either fixed or mobile. The fixed GCS is
enclosed in a customer-specified shelter. It
incorporates workstations that allow opera-
tors to control and monitor the aircraft, as
well as record and exploit downlinked pay-
load data. The mobile GCS allows operators
to perform the same functions and is con-
tained on a mobile trailer. Workstations in
either GCS can be tailored to meet customer
requirements. The GCS, technical data, and
documents are UNCLASSIFIED.
b. The Raytheon Multi-Spectral Targeting
System-B (MTS-B) integrates electro-optical
(EO), infrared (IR), laser designation and
laser illumination capabilities to provide de-
tection, ranging, and tracking capabilities
specifically for high-altitude applications.
This advanced EO and IR system provides
long-range surveillance, high altitude target
acquisition, tracking, range finding, and
laser designation for the Hellfire missile and
for all tri-service and NATO laser-guided
munitions.
c. The AN/APY–8 Lynx Block 20 Synthetic
Aperture Radar and Ground Moving Target
Radar system provides all-weather surveil-
lance, tracking and targeting for military
and commercial customers from manned and
unmanned vehicles. The AN/PY–8 Lynx
Block 20SAR/GMTI radar system and tech-
nical data/documents are UNCLASSIFIED.
d. The Honeywell H–764 Adaptive
Configurable Embedded Global Positioning
System/Inertial Guidance Unit (EGI) con-
tains the Force 524D GPS Receiver card with
Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module
(SAASM). The Force 524D is a 24-channel
SAASM based GPS receiver with precise po-
sitioning service capability built upon
Trimble’s next generation GPS technology.
The Force 524D retains backward compat-
ibility with the proven Force 5GS while add-
ing new functionality to interface with the
digital antenna electronics to significantly
improve anti jam performance. The host
platform can select the radio frequency of
digital antenna electronics interface. In the
digital mode, the Force 524D is capable of
controlling up to 16 independent beams.

FUTURE ACT
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President,
today, the Senate passed a solution
that Senator MURRAY and I reached to
permanently fund historically Black
colleges and universities and other mi-
nority serving institutions.
It is hard to think of a piece of legis-
lation that would have more of a last-
ing impact on minority students and
their families than this bill.
This legislation does two things:
First, it provides permanent fund-
ing—that is fully paid for—for HBCUs
and other Minority-Serving Institu-
tions attended by over 2 million minor-
ity students.
Second, after 5 years of bipartisan ef-
fort, it greatly simplifies the free ap-
plication for Federal student aid—the

S6886 December 5, 2019
FAFSA—that 20 million families, in-
cluding 8 million minority students,
fill out every year to qualify for Fed-
eral student aid.
This bipartition provision—which
was sponsored by Senators MURRAY,
WHITEHOUSE, and GARDNER when it
passed the Senate by unanimous con-
sent last December—stops families
from having to give their same tax in-
formation to the Federal Government
twice—first to the IRS, then again to
the Department of Education. Students
give permission to the IRS and the De-
partment of Education to share tax re-
turn data, which eliminates up to 22
questions on the FAFSA with one
click.
It should eliminate most of the so-
called verification process, which is a
bureaucratic nightmare that 5.5 mil-
lion students go through annually to
make sure the information they gave
to the Department of Education is ex-
actly the same as they gave to the IRS.
The president of East Tennessee State
University recently told me that half
the students applying to ETSU go
through verification at some point.
According to the Department of Edu-
cation, it helps taxpayers by elimi-
nating up to $6 billion each year in
mistakes—both in overpayments and
underpayments—in Pell grants and
student loans.
It has taken 20 years to reach this re-
sult, and it would not have happened
without Jeff Appel, a longtime staff
member at the Department of Edu-
cation who recently passed away, and
Secretary DeVos and Secretary
Mnuchin’s commitment to getting this
over the finish line.
In addition, I want to thank the staff
who have been instrumental in getting
the proposal to this place: on Senator
MURRAY’s staff, Kara Marachione,
Bryce McKibben, Mary Barry, and
Evan Schatz. Conor Sheehey with Sen-
ator SCOTT. Rebecca Howard with Sen-
ator JONES. Christopher Toppings with
Senator BURR. Corey Linehan with
Senator COONS. And from my staff,
Robert Moran, Lauren Davies, Andrew
LaCasse, Mary Catherine Cook, and
David Cleary.
The final step to simplify the FAFSA
is to pass additional legislation that
will reduce the 108 questions on the
FAFSA to a total of between 18 and 30
questions and make Pell grants pre-
dictable so students can know how
much grant aid they will receive to at-
tend college.
I and Senators MURRAY, SCOTT,
JONES, BURR, and COONS worked to-
gether to reach this result and I am
glad the Senate passed it today so it
can be sent to the House and signed
into law by the President before the
end of the year.
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President,
Florida is the Nation’s greatest melt-
ing pot, with people from all over the
Nation choosing to make Florida their
permanent home. Our State has the
best colleges and universities in the
Nation, including many Historically
Black Colleges and Universities and
Minority Serving Institutions. As Gov-
ernor of Florida, I made historic in-
vestments in higher education and
fought to keep higher education afford-
able so more students can get a great
education in Florida.
As Senator, I will continue to fight
to make sure every child has access to
a quality education at a price they can
afford. Our Historically Black Colleges
and Universities and Minority Serving
Institutions are critical to the success
of our State and the future of our chil-
dren, and I will always work to support
their mission.
The best way to support our colleges
and universities is to make sure our
economy is thriving so we have the re-
sources we need to invest in education.
That means we have to be careful
about how we are spending taxpayer
dollars. I have concerns any time the
government permanently funds a pro-
gram, no matter what that program is.
Funding anything permanently means
there is little to no accountability or
oversight. We must be careful to regu-
larly review every government-funded
program to make sure taxpayers are al-
ways getting the best return on their
investment.

TRIBUTE TO MAJOR JORDAN
KAHN
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise
today to acknowledge the service of my
defense fellow, Maj. Jordan Kahn, who
is approaching the end of his assign-
ment with my office as part of his ex-
perience in the U.S. Air Force Legisla-
tive Fellowship Program.
Major Kahn joined my office in Janu-
ary and his dedication, work ethic, and
intelligence quickly made him a trust-
ed voice on my legislative team. A
proud member of the U.S. Air Force, as
well as being a graduate of both the
U.S. Air Force Academy and the U.S.
Air Force Weapons School, Jordan has
deployed to defend our country mul-
tiple times, and because of his service,
our Nation is safer. Most importantly,
Jordan is a devoted husband and fa-
ther, and I have had the pleasure of
watching his family grow over the last
year. In November, his wife Becky gave
birth to their second son Haden, and
his firstborn son Harrison has now du-
tifully taken on the responsibility of
big brother.
As Major Kahn moves on to his next
assignment, I have full faith that he
will continue to excel as a leader in the
Air Force and would trust him in the
most demanding and sensitive posi-
tions within our Armed Forces. I ex-
tend my sincere thanks for his service
to our Nation and our office and wish
him and his family continued success
in his future endeavors.

TRIBUTE TO BETH WALSH, CLAIRE
PICHETTE, THOMAS REDMON,
AND JUSTINE HURLEY
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this
week I have the honor of recognizing
four Montana school teachers for their
passion and dedication to teaching
math and science to young Montanans.
Beth Walsh from East Valley Middle
School, Claire Pichette from Helena
High School, Thomas Redmon from
Daly Elementary, and Justine Hurley
from White Sulphur Springs Elemen-
tary School have all been awarded the
Presidential Award for Excellence in
Mathematics and Science Teaching be-
tween 2017 and 2018.
The Presidential Award for Excel-
lence in Mathematics and Science
Teaching is an incredibly high honor
for school teachers across the country
and no easy task to receive. A com-
mittee of Montana math and science
teachers select finalists from a collec-
tion of statewide applications followed
by a national panel of distinguished
scientists, mathematician, and edu-
cators who select four national award
winners from those finalists.
These teachers won the Presidential
Award for their superior abilities to
educate young Montanans on mathe-
matics and science ranging from kin-
dergarten children to seniors in high
school. They show passion for their
profession daily. and this award is a
symbol of that passion. We are lucky
to have such highly qualified teachers
educating Montana students.
It is my honor to recognize Beth
Walsh, Claire Pichette, Thomas
Redmon, and Justine Hurley for their
exemplary work educating Montana
students. They are a true testament to
the incredible education system we
have throughout Big Sky Country.∑

REMEMBERING DR. WOODIE
FLOWERS
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, today I
would like to recognize the life of an
extraordinary individual, Dr. Woodie
Flowers.
As an engineer, a professor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology—MIT—and an integral part of
FIRST—For Inspiration and Recogni-
tion of Science and Technology—
Woodie helped educate and inspire peo-
ple in New Hampshire, across the coun-
try, and around the world.
I first had the privilege of meeting
Woodie in the 1980s when I was doing
legal work for MIT. Almost imme-
diately, I recognized his curiosity and
eagerness to learn, his patience and un-
derstanding, and his desire to collabo-
rate and work effectively. Woodie ex-
tended that ethos and enthusiasm for
education to every aspect of his life, in-
cluding through his groundbreaking
leadership at MIT and FIRST.
Throughout his career, Woodie
brought a unique vision to his work

and frequently stressed that tech-
nology is changing at a pace that the
human brain simply cannot keep up
with. This understanding and concern
led him to emphasize the importance of
teaching critical thinking and an alle-
giance to objective truth, which he pos-
ited would push back against the trib-
alism and binary thinking afflicting
our society.
As part of his efforts to bridge divi-
sion and expand human understanding,
Woodie served as a mentor to countless
students. While following Woodie in a
speaking program was certainly a
daunting task, I always looked forward
to hearing his perspective at FIRST
events. The major theme that Woodie
sought to impart to students is that
life is not a zero sum game. He would
encourage them to work and compete
with ‘‘gracious professionalism,’’ where
you work hard and challenge one an-
other to be your very best, but you al-
ways engage with respect and kindness.
FIRST encourages its participants to
consider the annual contest as
‘‘coopertition,’’ and Woodie used the
opportunity to interact with the stu-
dents and coaches as a way to reinforce
this critical concept, that success
comes through bringing out the best in
each other and in humanity.
Woodie understood what a good lead-
er should be, and his vision and exam-
ple are characteristics that all Ameri-
cans should aspire to. And in many
ways, his confidence in our ability as
human beings to solve problems and
transcend our most basic tribal in-
stincts, informed by science and grace,
was uniquely American.
Dr. Woodie Flowers was one of the
most brilliant, kind, and creative peo-
ple I have ever met, and it was an
honor to know him. I extend my condo-
lences to Woodie’s talented and mag-
nificent wife and partner, Margaret,
and their entire family. And I join
them and the FIRST community in
mourning an extraordinarily intel-
ligent inventor, humanist, and Amer-
ican.
We will miss Woodie more than I can
say, but I am certain that his legacy
will live on through the countless lives
he has touched. The world is a smarter,
better, and more hopeful place because
Woodie Flowers lived his life with love
and purpose.∑
f
TRIBUTE TO EDWARD HALL
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, today it
is my honor to pay tribute to Edward
Hall, an incredible 96-year-old Ne-
vadan, whose story began when he an-
swered the call to defend his country.
Eighty years ago, in 1939, at the age of
16, Ed lied about his age to enlist in the
Army Air Corps and began his military
service to our great Nation. On Decem-
ber 7, 1941, at just 18 years old, he found
himself stationed at Hickam Field, Ha-
waii, working in the mess hall cleaning
up and preparing for the day when he
and his fellow troops heard an explo-
sion. This was the beginning of the
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and
Ed, like many of the men on Hickam
Field, stopped what he was doing to re-
spond to this attack on the American
Base. Without hesitation, Ed put his
life on the line, joining in to rescue his
fellow servicemembers injured in the
ongoing attack. Along with an Army
officer, Ed commandeered a truck and
began driving around the flight line
picking up the injured to move them to
the base hospital in spite of coming
into direct fire from Japanese aircraft.
Upon returning from his third round of
picking up the injured, Ed’s truck was
strafed by a Japanese Zero fighter and
taken out of action, but Ed kept at it,
as he knew helping the injured was his
priority. As the bodies of the dead and
injured continued to mount, Ed
grabbed a .45-caliber pistol off one of
his fallen comrades in order to have
the means to defend himself from the
attack as enemy planes buzzed the
skies above him. He would go on to
keep that pistol for the remainder of
the war.
As the attack on Pearl Harbor ended,
the recovery of the base began as Ed
and other survivors began dealing with
the aftermath of the attack and pre-
paring for our formal entry into World
War II in the Pacific theater. Ed kept
going, as many of the members of that
‘‘greatest generation’’ did throughout
World War II, embodying the American
spirit of tenacity when faced with the
greatest adversity, the spirit that
eventually led to our success in defeat-
ing tyranny and enabling freedom
across the world at the end of the
Great War in 1945.
Mr. President, to Edward Hall, I join
citizens across Nevada and the Nation
in sending our sincere gratitude to him
for his service to the United States. It
is heroes like Ed whose service has
kept our communities, States, Nation,
and world safe. His service during
World War II, and the life he has led
since are an incredible testament to re-
silience, and we are forever grateful.

By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and
Mr. CASSIDY):
S. 2989. A bill to amend title XI of the
Social Security Act to clarify the mail-
ing requirement relating to social se-
curity account statements; to the Com-
mittee on Finance.
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I along
with Finance Committee member Sen-
ator CASSIDY are introducing a bill to
make a common-sense, low-cost change
to the law that will help American
workers help themselves when pre-
paring for retirement: The Know Your
Social Security Act. This bill is simple:
it clarifies the law about Congressional
intent so that every worker over 25 re-
ceives a Social Security statement in
the mail each year, unless the worker
has accessed their statement online or
declined to receive the statement in
the mail.
The history of the Social Security
statement runs right through the Sen-
ate and the ‘‘powerful’’ Committee on
Finance. Senator Daniel Patrick Moy-
nihan summed up the intent very well:
‘‘All of us pay into Social Security but
rarely, until we become beneficiaries,
do we ever hear from Social Security
. . . . in every paycheck, we see money
withheld for Social Security, but we
hear nary a word from the Social Secu-
rity Administration. Let us take this
simple step [sending statements] to re-
assure Americans that Social Security
will be there for them.’’ The Social Se-
curity statement has three goals: to
provide workers with information
about their Social Security benefits, to
help workers plan for the future, and
enable workers to review their earn-
ings records.
After enactment and once fully
phased in, every worker aged 25 and
older received an annual statement
from Social Security starting in the
year 2000. After a few years, Social Se-
curity’s website allowed workers to ob-
tain a Social Security statement on-
line. At the time, the online option was
a good step forward in customer serv-
ice. But as sometime happens, ad-
vances in technology shortchanged
good intentions. Due to tight budgets,
SSA came to view the online option as

‘‘providing’’ the worker with a state-
ment and fulfilling their responsibil-
ities under the law. SSA stopped mail-
ing the statements in 2011 in order to
shift resources towards other prior-
ities. Currently, only individuals over
the age of 60 who are not receiving ben-
efits receive statements through the
mail.
Paper statements delivered through
the mail are desirable because no ac-
tion is necessary by the worker and the
statement is a yearly reminder to the
worker to think about the future. Re-
search has shown that workers pro-
vided with statements are significantly
more likely to save, more certain
about their retirement income, and
have higher satisfaction with their fi-
nances relative to those who are not
provided with any type of financial
planning materials. Providing Social
Security statement through the mail is
a simple policy that could help many
workers, hopefully leading to better de-
cisions about their financial future.
Ways and Means Social Security Sub-
committee Chairman JOHN LARSON and
Ways and Means Committee Member
VERN BUCHANAN are introducing the
companion bill in the House of Rep-
resentatives. We have received letters
of endorsement from AARP, the Coali-
tion for Paper Options, Justice in
Aging, the National Committee to Pre-
serve Social Security and Medicare,
Paralyzed Veterans of America, Social
Security Works, The Arc of the United
States and The Senior Citizens League.
I ask that the letters be included in the
RECORD following my remarks.
I hope my colleagues in the Senate
will join us and cosponsor the Know
Your Social Security Act. Together, we
can work towards better retirement
outcomes for all Americans.

DEAR RANKING MEMBER WYDEN AND SEN-
ATOR CASSIDY: On behalf of our nearly 38 mil-
lion members and all older Americans na-
tionwide, AARP is pleased to endorse the
Know Your Social Security Act. This bipar-
tisan bill would once again place vital, paper
Social Security statements in the hands of
millions of Americans, to help them more ef-
fectively plan for retirement, identify fraud
and correct earnings records, and better un-
derstand their stake in Social Security.
The Social Security statement is an essen-
tial financial planning tool that provides
key information on an individual’s earnings
and payroll tax contributions record, as well
as an estimate of their earned monthly bene-
fits. When Social Security sends this state-
ment through the mail, more Americans are
able to better plan for their future, not only
due to an increased understanding of their
Social Security benefits, but also any gaps in
their current retirement plan. Having a hard
copy of your Social Security statement also
allows an individual to spot and correct er-
rors or even to detect outright fraud. Find-
ing and correcting these errors in a timely
manner will save workers and the Social Se-
curity Administration frustration, time and
money. Finally, when Americans receive an
annual statement in the mail, it helps them
better understand the importance of Social
Security as part of their overall retirement
plan. Paper statements are annual remind-
ers, especially to younger workers, that they
have contributed to Social Security and have
earned a stake in the program.
AARP believes strongly that all Ameri-
cans, unless they opt-out, should have access
to their Social Security statements via mail.
We are pleased to endorse the Know Your So-
cial Security Act to once again place vital,
paper statements in the hands of millions of
Americans. If you have any questions, please
feel free to contact me, or have your staff
contact Tom Nicholls on our Government Af-
fairs staff at tnicholls@aarp.org or (202) 434–
3765.

DEAR REPRESENTATIVES LARSON, BUCHANAN
AND SENATORS WYDEN AND CASSIDY: The Coa-
lition for Paper Options—an alliance of con-
sumer organizations, labor unions, rural ad-
vocates, and print communications industry
leaders is pleased to support today’s intro-
duction of the bipartisan Know Your Social
Security Act. Introduced in both the House
and Senate, the bill would require the Social
Security Administration to reinstate the
mailing of annual Statement of Earnings
until such time as a wage earner establishes
an on line account.
The annual Statement, which summarizes
each wage earner’s recorded earnings and
projects future retirement benefits, has been
hailed as one of the most important financial
planning tools that most Americans will
ever see, yet the Social Security Administra-
tion stopped sending these statements to
workers in 2017 without any congressional
oversight. A report released in February 2019
by the Social Security Administration’s In-
spector General highlights a tremendous de-
cline in overall access since the primarily
online-only policy took place.
The Know Your Social Security Act would
reinstate the mailing of the Statements
until a wage earner accesses their account
through the my Social Security online por-
tal. This would allow the Social Security Ad-
ministration to economize as online partici-
pation grows, but it would not force citizens
into online access before they choose or are
able to manage it.
CPO’s diverse network of allies includes:
Consumer Action, Social Security Works,
the National Consumers League, the Na-
tional Grange, the National Association of
Letter Carriers, as well as leading organiza-
tions in the paper and print communications
industry is pleased to endorse this important
legislation and offer our full support.

JUSTICE IN AGING,
Washington, DC, December 4, 2019.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVES LARSON AND
BUCHANAN, AND SENATORS WYDEN AND CAS-
SIDY: Justice in Aging endorses the bipar-
tisan Know Your Social Security Act, which
would reaffirm SSA’s obligation to send So-
cial Security statements by mail to all
workers each year. This legislation would
clarify SSA’s duty and ensure that workers
understand the Social Security benefits they
are earning over time.
Many people are not fully aware of the
level of Social Security benefits they could
receive when they retire, nor do they realize
the Social Security benefits available for
themselves and their family members in the
event that they experience a disability that
limits their capacity to work, or in the event
that they pass away leaving a spouse, young
children, or other eligible survivors. The
Know Your Social Security Act would pro-
vide this important information, as required,
to ensure that workers know what benefits
are available to them and their loved ones,
allowing them to better plan for retirement
as they age.
We believe it is not only SSA’s obligation
to send these statements, but that it is vital
to the well-being of workers who need to be
fully informed about their potential Social
Security benefits in order to make decisions
about their own working lives, and their re-
tirement. While those who choose to get this
information electronically and decline a
paper statement have clearly demonstrated
their awareness of the benefits they may re-
ceive in the future, others who do not make
this choice should receive the statement in
the mail as required under the law. For these
reasons, Justice in Aging supports this bill.
Sincerely,
TRACEY GRONNIGER,
Director of Economic Security.

DEAR CHAIRMAN LARSON, CONGRESSMAN
BUCHANAN, RANKING MEMBER WYDEN AND
SENATOR CASSIDY: On behalf of the millions
of members and supporters of the National
Committee to Preserve Social Security and
Medicare, I am writing to endorse your bill,
the Know Your Social Security Act. This im-
portant legislation requires the Social Secu-
rity Administration to resume annual mail-
ing of Social Security statements to all of
the estimated 150 million American workers
who are eligible to receive them, and have
not otherwise accessed them through their
My SSA account.
For nearly a decade now, SSA has unilater-
ally nullified section 1143 of the Social Secu-
rity Act by refusing to mail annual state-
ments to workers, even though section 1143
is unambiguously clear that such statements
are required. The Know Your Social Security
Act clarifies that mailings are required, a
measure that is deeply appreciated by our
members.
The Social Security statement is one of
the many enduring legacies left to the na-
tion by one of its most distinguished law-
makers, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of
New York. He regarded the statement as a
simple and efficient way of building public

support and understanding for Social Secu-
rity. Not surprisingly, Senator Moynihan’s
simple, common sense amendment worked as
intended while SSA was producing the state-
ments each year. In fact, the bipartisan So-
cial Security Advisory Board of 10 years ago
found that SSA’s own survey data showed
‘‘. . . a link between increasing public con-
fidence and receipt of a statement. People
who receive a statement not only experience
higher knowledge of Social Security than
non-recipients, but also exhibit greater con-
fidence that the program still will be there
for them when they need it.’’
The statement also raises workers’ aware-
ness of the need for retirement planning by
focusing attention on their future retire-
ment income. It brings clarity to an often
confusing and perplexing subject by pro-
viding a starting point: the individual’s esti-
mated Social Security benefits, whether re-
tirement, survivors or disability insurance.
From there, workers can determine how
much more they need to save for the future.
Because the statements were intended to
reach people early in their working lives,
they provided an invaluable service.
Another important function of the Social
Security statement, if it were to be delivered
annually as Congress intended, would be to
enable workers to determine the accuracy of
the wage records maintained by SSA for
each worker. As the statement indicates,
workers are encouraged to review the chart
showing their reported wages, comparing the
amounts reflected on SSA’s records with in-
formation from the worker’s own records.
Workers are further advised that only they
can perform this function and that they
should report discrepancies to SSA as soon
as possible.
We have been especially concerned that,
with the suspension of statements to all but
those who are approaching retirement age,
few workers have been able to check the ac-
curacy of SSA’s wage records. The annual
statement, when it was being provided,
helped to assure that if errors were made in
the reporting of wages that they could be
quickly discovered and corrected while the
required evidence would still be readily at
hand. Since SSA has suspended the state-
ments now for nearly a decade, we are con-
cerned that many errors in SSA’s records
will go undetected and that some workers’
benefits will be reduced as a result.
As mentioned earlier, one function per-
formed by annual distribution of Social Se-
curity statements was to inform workers of
the kinds of benefits that are provided by So-
cial Security. The statements focused on re-
tirement, survivors, and disability benefits.
In other words, the statements were an in-
valuable annual tutorial of what Social Se-
curity is all about. And knowledge about So-
cial Security is vitally important to the suc-
cessful functioning of the program. We see
that reflected in recent work that finds that
one reason for the seemingly inexplicable re-
cent decline in disability applications is re-
lated to the suspension of the statements.
Clearly, restoration of annual production
and mailing of the annual statements, as is
required in the Know Your Social Security
Act, is long overdue.
When it was being mailed to all eligible
workers, the Social Security statement was
able to play a critical role in building and
strengthening public confidence in Social Se-
curity. It provided workers with the only
meaningful pre-retirement information that
they ever received about the program and
the benefits they could expect when they re-
tire or otherwise qualify for benefits. SSA’s
decision to end annual mailings has harmed
many workers. It is time for SSA to undo
this harmful decision and to follow the clear,
unambiguous requirements of the law to
mail statements to all eligible workers. We
applaud you for your leadership in intro-
ducing the Know Your Social Security Act,
and look forward to working with you to
enact this important measure.
Sincerely,
MAX RICHTMAN,
President and CEO.

DEAR SENATORS WYDEN AND CASSIDY,
CHAIRMAN LARSON AND REPRESENTATIVE
BUCHANAN: Paralyzed Veterans of America
(PVA) is pleased to support the Know Your
Social Security Act. PVA is the nation’s
only Congressionally chartered veterans
service organization solely dedicated to rep-
resenting veterans with spinal cord injuries
and/or disorders. Many of our members are
among the nine million veterans who receive
Social Security retirement or disability ben-
efits. Others are among the millions of vet-
erans and military service members and
their families who will at some point in their
lives benefit from the system.
For many years, the Social Security Ad-
ministration (SSA) issued paper earnings
and benefits statements that helped to in-
form people about their status under Social
Security and what they might expect to re-
ceive in retirement or in the event of a cata-
strophic disability. When SSA suspended
that practice in favor of disseminating the
statements only online, it meant that people
who lack internet access or who prefer not to
set up an internet account lost access to that
information. These Americans are then de-
nied knowing about what they have accumu-
lated on their earnings record, what their re-
tirement benefits might be, what they might
receive in spousal benefits, or the fact they
qualify for disability or survivor benefits.
As we understand, your bill will clarify
that the existing requirement in the Social
Security Act for SSA to provide an annual
Social Security Statement means providing
this document by mail. The bill also clarifies
that SSA may provide an on-demand elec-
tronic statement when an individual chooses
electronic delivery. Furthermore, the bill
stipulates that SSA has met its requirement
to mail an annual statement if individuals
have accessed their statements electroni-
cally in the prior year and have declined to
receive their statements by mail for that
year.
This will be a very helpful measure for mil-
lions of Americans. PVA thanks you for in-
troducing the Know Your Social Security
Act and urges Congress to do all it can to
quickly pass this bipartisan legislation this
year.
Sincerely,
HEATHER ANSLEY,

Washington, DC, December 5, 2019.
Hon. RON WYDEN,
Washington, DC.
Hon. JOHN LARSON,
Washington, DC.
Hon. BILL CASSIDY,
Washington, DC.
Hon. VERN BUCHANAN,
Washington, DC.
DEAR CHAIRMAN WYDEN, SENATOR CASSIDY,
CHAIRMAN LARSON, AND REPRESENTATIVE
BUCHANAN: We strongly endorse your new
legislation, the Know Your Social Security
Act. Your bill clarifies the important law
Congress passed in 1989 requiring the Social
Security Administration (SSA) to mail So-
cial Security earnings statements to those
earning benefits with every paycheck.
When the late Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan introduced the original earnings
statement legislation in 1988, he explained
one of the reasons mailing these statements
is so crucial:
‘‘All of us pay into Social Security but
rarely, until we become beneficiaries, do we
ever hear from Social Security . . . every
month, in every paycheck, we see money
withheld for Social Security, but we hear
nary a word from the Social Security Admin-
istration. Let us take this simple step [mail-
ing Social Security earnings statements] to
reassure Americans that Social Security will
be there for them . . .’’
Social Security earnings statements help
families plan for the future. The statements
educate and inform working families of the
kinds of benefits they are earning. Crucially,
they allow workers to identify and correct
their earnings records in a timely way, when
mistakes are made.
Your wise legislation clarifies that these
vital statements are to be mailed automati-
cally each year. Distressingly, more and
more private and public services are being
shifted to individuals. This should not hap-
pen with Social Security. As technology con-
tinues to progress, there is a tendency for
administrators to lean more on its capabili-
ties and move communications with con-
sumers and constituents online. Electronic
communication is, no doubt, desired in many
situations. However, the most important fi-
nancial documents, including the Social Se-
curity earnings statements, should default
to postal mail as intended by the original
law.
That the earnings statements be mailed is
vital for everyone, including those who have
access to high speed computing. Of course,
not everyone even has this kind of access.
For example, a 2018 Pew Research Survey
found that one in four Americans living in
rural areas lack reliable access to high speed
internet service. Other polling found that
Americans, even those between ages 18 and
29, prefer not to receive important informa-
tion from SSA online.
We applaud your effort to clarify the re-
quirement that annual Social Security earn-
ings statements be mailed. We are confident
that the Know Your Social Security Act will
help strengthen Social Security. We look
forward to working with you to see this ex-
cellent bipartisan legislation become law
quickly.
Sincerely,
NANCY J. ALTMAN,
President.
ALEX LAWSON,
Executive Director.

December 5, 2019
THE ARC,
December 4, 2019.
Representative LARSON,
Washington, DC.
Senator WYDEN,
Washington, DC.
Representative BUCHANAN,
Washington, DC.
Senator CASSIDY,
Washington, DC.
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE LARSON, REP-
RESENTATIVE BUCHANAN, SENATOR WYDEN,
AND SENATOR CASSIDY: The Arc of the United
States writes in support of the Know Your
Social Security Act. The Arc is the largest
national community-based organization ad-
vocating for people with intellectual and de-
velopmental disabilities (I/DD) and their
families.
Social Security statements are a crucial
tool to help recipients plan for their future
by providing accurate information about
their earnings and future benefits. In addi-
tion, the statement raises awareness about
all Social Security benefits, including about
the Disability and Survivors Insurance that
helps many people with I/DD. It also allows
claimants to ensure that their earnings
records are accurate.
We are concerned that recent changes that
the Social Security Administration has
made to only mail paper statements to a
limited population means that many people
are not receiving this crucial information.
While the information may be available via
the My Social Security website, less than
half of registered users of the website
checked their statements in 2018. In addi-
tion, low income households are less likely
to have internet access at home and be able
to access the website, despite the importance
of Social Security benefits to these house-
holds; using library or other public internet
sources is not advised due to the highly pri-
vate nature of the information and the risk
of identity theft. Without mailed state-
ments, those households may have no access
to the crucially important information
about their Social Security benefits in the
statement necessary to plan for their fu-
tures.
For these reasons, we strongly support the
Know Your Social Security Act. Please con-
tact Bethany Lilly at lilly@thearc.org with
any questions, or if you would like to further
discuss these issues.
Sincerely,
BETHANY LILLY,
Director of Income Policy.
THE SENIOR CITIZENS LEAGUE,
Alexandria, VA, December 4, 2019.
Hon. VERN BUCHANAN,
Washington, DC.
Hon. BILL CASSIDY,
Washington, DC.
Hon. JOHN LARSON,
Washington, DC.
Hon. RON WYDEN,
Washington, DC.
DEAR CONGRESSMEN BUCHANAN, CONGRESS-
MAN LARSON, SENATOR CASSIDY AND SENATOR
WYDEN: On behalf of the approximately one
million supporters of The Senior Citizens
League (TSCL), I would like to thank you for
being true champions for Social Security
beneficiaries.
The Senior Citizens League lends its en-
thusiastic support to the ‘‘Know Your Social
Security Act’’. Every American who pays
into Social Security has a right to see a
written statement from Social Security to
ensure their record is accurate, and to learn
the estimated amount of their benefits. A
printed record is important for those who do
not have the means to routinely access their
record electronically and it serves as a crit-
ical planning tool for determining the best
retirement dates. Regular receipt of these
statements serves to remind and educate
older workers of the benefits of staying in
the workforce. Doing so strengthens retire-
ment benefits, strengthens Social Security
and strengthens our national economy.
As such, TSCL salutes you for introducing
legislation that clarifies that the require-
ment in the Social Security Act for SSA to
provide an annual Social Security State-
ment means providing it by mail. The bill
also clarifies that SSA may provide an on-
demand statement electronically when the
individual chooses electronic delivery for
that request; and that SSA has met its re-
quirement to mail an annual Statement if an
individual has accessed their Statement
electronically in the prior year and has de-
clined to receive their Statement by mail for
that year.
We look forward to informing our sup-
porters about your leadership on this impor-
tant issue in Congress. In the meantime, if
we may be of assistance to you or your staff
in any way, please do not hesitate to call
upon us. Again, thank you for being a posi-
tive voice for America’s seniors.
Sincerely,
RICK DELANEY,
Chairman.
By Mr. THUNE:
S. 2990. A bill to require that the Fed-
eral Government procure from the pri-
vate sector the goods and services nec-
essary for the operations and manage-
ment of certain Government agencies,
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs.
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the text of the
bill be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the text of
the bill was ordered to be printed in
the RECORD, as follows:
S. 2990
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Freedom
from Government Competition Act of 2019’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress makes the following findings:
(1) Private sector business concerns, which
are free to respond to the private or public
demands of the marketplace, constitute the
strength of the United States economic sys-
tem.
(2) Competitive private enterprises are the
most productive, efficient, and effective
sources of goods and services.
(3) Unfair Government competition with
the private sector of the economy is detri-
mental to the United States economic sys-
tem.
(4) Unfair Government competition with
the private sector of the economy is at an
unacceptably high level, both in scope and in
dollar volume.
(5) Current law and policy have failed to
address adequately the problem of unfair
Government competition with the private
sector of the economy.
(6) It is in the public interest that the Fed-
eral Government establish a consistent pol-
icy to rely on the private sector of the econ-
omy to provide goods and services necessary
for or beneficial to the operation and man-
agement of Federal agencies and to avoid un-
fair Government competition with the pri-
vate sector of the economy.
SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
In this Act, the term ‘‘agency’’ means—
(1) an executive department as defined by
section 101 of title 5, United States Code;
(2) a military department as defined by
section 102 of such title; and
(3) an independent establishment as de-
fined by section 104(l) of such title.
SEC. 4. PROCUREMENT FROM PRIVATE SOURCES.
(a) POLICY.—In the process of governing,
the Federal Government should not compete
with its citizens. The competitive enterprise
system, characterized by individual freedom
and initiative, is the primary source of na-
tional economic strength. In recognition of
this principle, it has been and continues to
be the general policy of the Federal Govern-
ment—
(1) to rely on commercial sources to supply
the products and services the Government
needs;
(2) to refrain from providing a product or
service if the product or service can be pro-
cured more economically from a commercial
source; and
(3) to utilize Federal employees to perform
inherently governmental functions (as that
term is defined in section 5 of the Federal
Activities Inventory Reform Act of 1998
(Public Law 105–270; 112 Stat. 2384)).
(b) GENERAL RULE.—Except as provided in
subsection (c) and notwithstanding any
other provision of law, each agency shall ob-
tain all goods and services necessary for or
beneficial to the accomplishment of its au-
thorized functions by procurement from pri-
vate sources.
(c) EXEMPTIONS.—Subsection (b) shall not
apply to an agency with respect to goods or
services if—
(1) the goods or services are required by
law to be produced or performed, respec-
tively, by the agency; or
(2) the head of the agency determines and
certifies to Congress in accordance with reg-
ulations promulgated by the Director of the
Office of Management and Budget that—
(A) Federal Government production, manu-
facture, or provision of a good or service is
necessary for the national defense or home-
land security;
(B) a good or service is so critical to the
mission of the agency or so inherently gov-
ernmental in nature that it is in the public
interest to require production or perform-
ance, respectively, by Government employ-
ees; or
(C) there is no private source capable of
providing the good or service.
(d) METHOD OF PROCUREMENT.—The provi-
sion of goods and services not exempt under
subsection (c) shall be performed by an enti-
ty in the private sector through—
(1) the divestiture of Federal involvement
in the provision of a good or service;
(2) the award of a contract to an entity in
the private sector, using competitive proce-
dures, as defined in section 152 of title 41,
United States Code, and section 2302 of title
10, United States Code; or
(3) conducting a public-private competitive
sourcing analysis in accordance with the
procedures established by the Office of Man-
agement and Budget and determining that
using the assets, facilities, and performance
of the private sector is in the best interest of
the United States and that production or
performance, respectively, by the private
sector provides the best value to the tax-
payer.
(e) CONTRACTED ACTIVITIES.—The head of
an agency may utilize Federal employees to
provide goods or services previously provided
by an entity in the private sector upon com-
pletion of a public-private competitive
sourcing analysis described in subsection
(d)(3), and after making a determination that
the provision of such goods or services by
Federal employees provides the best value to
the taxpayer.

tivities carried out in each agency, including
those identified as commercial and inher-
ently governmental in nature in the inven-

tivities Inventory Reform Act of 1998 (Public
Law 105–270; 31 U.S.C. 501 note) and shall
transmit a report to the Congress prior to

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Merrill’s
Marauders Congressional Gold Medal Act’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(1) in August 1943, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt and other Allied leaders proposed
the creation of a ground unit of the Armed
Forces that would engage in a ‘‘long-range
penetration mission’’ in Japanese-occupied
Burma to—
(A) cut off Japanese communications and
supply lines; and
(B) capture the town of Myitkyina and the
Myitkyina airstrip, both of which were held
by the Japanese;
(2) President Roosevelt issued a call for
volunteers for ‘‘a dangerous and hazardous
mission’’ and the call was answered by ap-
proximately 3,000 soldiers from the United
States;
(3) the Army unit composed of the soldiers
described in paragraph (2)—
(A) was officially designated as the ‘‘5307th
Composite Unit (Provisional)’’ with the code
name ‘‘Galahad’’; and
(B) later became known as ‘‘Merrill’s Ma-
rauders’’ (referred to in this section as the
‘‘Marauders’’) in reference to its leader, Brig-
adier General Frank Merrill;
(4) in February 1944, the Marauders began
their approximately 1,000-mile trek through
the dense Burmese jungle with no artillery
support, carrying their supplies on their
backs or the pack saddles of mules;
(5) over the course of their 5-month trek to
Myitkyina, the Marauders fought victori-
ously against larger Japanese forces through
5 major and 30 minor engagements;
(6) during their march to Myitkyina, the
Marauders faced hunger and disease that
were exacerbated by inadequate aerial resup-
ply drops;
(7) malaria, typhus, and dysentery inflicted
more casualties on the Marauders than the
Japanese;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6896 December 5, 2019
(8) by August 1944, the Marauders had ac-
complished their mission, successfully dis-
rupting Japanese supply and communication
lines and taking the town of Myitkyina and
the Myitkyina airstrip, the only all-weather
airstrip in Northern Burma;
(9) after taking Myitkyina, only 130 Ma-
rauders out of the original 2,750 were fit for
duty and all remaining Marauders still in ac-
tion were evacuated to hospitals due to trop-
ical diseases, exhaustion, and malnutrition;
(10) for their bravery and accomplish-
ments, the Marauders were awarded the
‘‘Distinguished Unit Citation’’, later redesig-
nated as the ‘‘Presidential Unit Citation’’,
and a Bronze Star; and
(11) though the Marauders were oper-
ational for only a few months, the legacy of
their bravery is honored by the Army
through the modern day 75th Ranger Regi-
ment, which traces its lineage directly to the
5307th Composite Unit.
SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.
(a) AWARD AUTHORIZED.—The Speaker of
the House of Representatives and the Presi-
dent pro tempore of the Senate shall make
appropriate arrangements for the award, on
behalf of Congress, of a single gold medal of
appropriate design to the soldiers of the
5307th Composite Unit (Provisional) (referred
to in this section as ‘‘Merrill’s Marauders’’),
in recognition of their bravery and out-
standing service in the jungles of Burma dur-
ing World War II.
(b) DESIGN AND STRIKING.—For the pur-
poses of the award referred to in subsection
(a), the Secretary of the Treasury (referred
to in this Act as the ‘‘Secretary’’) shall
strike a gold medal with suitable emblems,
devices, and inscriptions, to be determined
by the Secretary.
(c) SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—Following the award of
the gold medal referred to in subsection (a)
in honor of Merrill’s Marauders, the gold
medal shall be given to the Smithsonian In-
stitution, where it shall be displayed as ap-
propriate and made available for research.
(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that the Smithsonian Institution
should make the gold medal received under
paragraph (1) available for display elsewhere,
particularly at other locations and events
associated with Merrill’s Marauders.
SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.
Under such regulations as the Secretary
may prescribe, the Secretary may strike and
sell duplicates in bronze of the gold medal
struck under section 3, at a price sufficient
to cover the costs of the medals, including
labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and
overhead expenses.
SEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS.
Medals struck pursuant to this Act are na-
tional medals for purposes of chapter 51 of
title 31, United States Code.

TRIBUTE FOR MOHAMMED
CHOWDHURY
HON. MAX ROSE
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, December 5, 2019
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor Mohammed K. Chowdhury,
a Staten Island resident. Mr. Chowdhury is an
activist, community organizer, and civil servant
who has spent his life fighting to make the
world a better place.
Mr. Chowdhury was born in rural Ban-
gladesh. Beginning as a college student, he
fought to better the lives of rural Bangladeshis
in a whole host of areas, including education,
infrastructure, healthcare, and communica-
tions. He also pushed for democratic reforms,
fighting against autocratic government and en-
suring that everyone would have the right to
vote.
Upon moving to the United States, Mr.
Chowdhury did not stop trying to better his
communities. He has served as a civil servant
in both the New York City and New York State
systems. In both jobs, he was an active union
member. He currently serves as the Council
Leader for the New York State Public Employ-
ees Federation (PEF) Division 349.
Mr. Chowdhury has consistently fought on
behalf of Staten Island’s South Asian commu-
nity. In 2015, he became the Staten Island
Chapter Secretary of the Alliance of South
Asian American Labor (ASAAL) in 2015. By
2016, he had risen to become the National
Secretary of the ASAAL. Under his leadership,
ASAAL has grown to include 12 chapters
across five states.
Mr. Chowdhury’s work to raise the voice for
the voiceless and build coalitions between
labor and community organizations should
serve as an example to all of us. With a vision
for the future, a desire to bring people to-
gether, and a tenacious work ethic, we truly
can enact change.
So, Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in
the House to join me in honoring Mohammed
Chowdhury’s work to make communities
across the world, from Staten Island to rural
Bangladesh, a better place.

CELEBRATING TELEGRAM NEWS-
PAPER’S 75 YEARS OF LOCAL
JOURNALISM
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, December 5, 2019
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in
tribute to the Telegram Newspaper, a local
paper serving the Wayne County communities
of Detroit, Ecorse, and River Rouge.
Founded in 1944, the Telegram is a multi-
cultural community newspaper that is distrib-
uted weekly with the goal of connecting citi-
zens within the region by publishing informa-
tion that educates, enlightens, uplifts and em-
powers its readers. The Telegram has been in
continuous publication since its inception and
continues to be unique in its approach to pro-
viding news the community turns to for local,
state and national information.
We are especially proud of the Telegram’s
legacy as an African American-owned and run
business and its outstanding commitment to
the communities it serves. Their staff has de-
veloped partnerships with local schools, busi-
nesses, non-profit organizations, and city gov-
ernments. They also participate in volunteer
opportunities and provide media sponsorships
for community events. The Telegram is help-
ing to prepare the next generation of media
personnel by establishing internship programs
with local colleges & high schools. They ex-
pose youth to newspapers through the News-
papers in Education Program and Write Steps
Internship Program.
Please join me in saluting publisher Gina
Steward and the Telegram Newspaper for
seventy-five years of local reporting.

IN MEMORY OF MR. LARRY N.
WOFFORD
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, December 5, 2019
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it
is with a heavy heart and solemn remem-
brance that I rise to pay tribute to a great man
and dear friend of longstanding, Mr. Larry N.
Wofford. Larry passed away on Tuesday, De-
cember 3, 2019, and a funeral service will be
held on Saturday, December 7, 2019, at 11:00
a.m. at the Chapel of Vance Brooks Funeral
Home in Phenix City, Alabama.
A native son of Columbus, Georgia, Larry
was born on August 1, 1944, to the union of
the late Claude Newton Wofford and Zola
Coker Wofford. He was retired from AT&T
where he faithfully worked for over 47 years.
During his distinguished career, he served as
President, Communication Workers of America
(CWA) Local No. 3212 for over 38 years;
President, CWA Retirees for over five years;
member of five Bargaining Committees; mem-
ber of Telephone Pioneers of America; Presi-
dent, Chattahoochee Valley Labor Council for
four years; and was actively involved with the
Georgia Sheriff’s Youth Homes in LaGrange,
Georgia for over 25 years. Former Congress-
woman Shirley Chisholm once said that ‘‘Serv-
ice is the rent that we pay for the space that
we occupy here on this earth.’’ Larry paid his
rent and he paid it well!
He will be remembered for his insightful and
optimistic spirit, his passion for helping others,
and his immense love for his family. He leaves
behind a great legacy in how life should be
lived and warm cherished memories in the
lives of those who knew him.
While he was preceded in death by his par-
ents, he is survived by his loving wife, Sue,
and a host of family, friends, and colleagues
in the labor movement, who will miss him
dearly. On a personal note, I am proud to
have called Larry my friend. He was always
encouraging and supportive of my career in
the Georgia General Assembly and in the
United States Congress and I will be forever
grateful for his friendship, advice, and counsel
over the years.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me, along with my wife, Vivian; and the more
than 730,000 residents of Georgia’s Second
Congressional District in saluting Mr. Larry N.
Wofford for his lifelong dedication to serving
working men and women and humankind in
general. I would also like to ask my colleagues
in the House to join us in extending our deep-
est sympathies to Larry’s family, friends, and
loved ones during this difficult time. We pray
that they will be consoled and comforted by an
abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days,
weeks, and months ahead.

RETIREMENT OF MS. PAULA
KOCHER BARNES
HON. JOHN LEWIS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, December 5, 2019
Mr. LEWIS. Madam Speaker, today, I rise to
recognize Ms. Paula Kocher Barnes on her re-
tirement from the Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS) and for her decades
of public service.
For over 40 years, Ms. Barnes served our
country—most recently as deputy associate
general counsel for the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) in the Office of
the General Counsel located in Georgia’s Fifth
Congressional District.
It took some time for Ms. Barnes to make
her way to our wonderful city. A native daugh-
ter of Iowa, Ms. Barnes completed her under-
graduate degree at Coe College in Cedar
Rapids. She continued her studies at Emory
University’s School of Law, where I believe
Metro Atlanta infused her spirit. Ms. Barnes
began a career in federal service at the De-
partment of Education in 1980 and joined the
HHS Office of the General Counsel in the Re-
gion IV Atlanta Office a couple of years later.
After five years in the regional office, Ms.
Barnes transitioned to the CDC’s Agency for
Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
(ATSDR), where she continued her federal ca-
reer for the next 32 years. During her tenure
with the ATSDR, Ms. Barnes served on the
front lines of implementing policy at the inter-
section of environment and health policy, an
issue that is near and dear to my heart. As an
attorney-advisor, Ms. Barnes worked to imple-
ment the Superfund Amendments and Reau-
thorization Act, a monumental bill which be-
came public law the same year that I was
elected to Congress.
As a senior attorney, Ms. Barnes continued
this important effort by providing key counsel

for interagency initiatives and memoranda on
environmental health policy. In January 2014,
the Centers for Disease Control promoted Ms.
Barnes to the prominent position of deputy as-
sociate general counsel for the CDC/ATSDR
Branch. Over the years, she contributed to liti-
gation efforts regarding the Agent Orange ex-
posure studies, the Federal Advisory Com-
mittee Act-National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health (NIOSH) Diesel Study,
Freedom of Information Act, ATSDR cost re-
covery, and the precedential Hanford
Downwinders case.
Ms. Barnes also managed to find the time to
advance scholarship and policy in her profes-
sional field by contributing to numerous publi-
cations, including two prominent public health
law textbooks and several articles. In addition,
she served as an adjunct professor at Georgia
State University’s and Emory University’s law
schools and as a guest lecturer at Duke Uni-
versity.
During her esteemed career, Ms. Barnes
played a critical role in several significant pub-
lic health activities and events, including emer-
gency responses to the September 11th trag-
edy, anthrax threats, Ebola Virus, Zika, and
several major natural disasters. Our nation
and the global family are forever grateful for
Ms. Barnes and so many other CDC employ-
ees who help keep us safe, healthy, and alive.
Today, I would like to thank Ms. Barnes for
her 41 years of federal service, for her dedica-
tion to public health, public service, and edu-
cation. As she prepares for a well-deserved
retirement, I wish Ms. Barnes the very best as
she embarks upon this next chapter.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF
WHITNEY DOTSON
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, December 5, 2019
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the service of long-time
community advocate, Whitney Dotson.
Whitney Dotson’s commitment to the good
of his community is demonstrated by his ca-
reer with the East Bay Regional Park District.
Beginning as an appointed member of the
Park District Advisory Committee, he later was
elected to the Board of Directors where he
worked on his passion for parks and health.
During his many years on the Board of Di-
rectors, Whitney has supported several signifi-
cant projects, including the Atlas Road Bridge
at Point Pinole, restoration of Albany Beach,
and preservation of the North Richmond
Shoreline. He also supported the completion
of two Bay Trails, one between Pinole Shores
and Bayfront Park and the other between
Berkeley and Albany. Director Dotson fought
to prevent commercial and residential develop-
ment of the Breuner Marsh at Point Pinole,
which was renamed the Dotson Family Marsh.
Through this project, Director Dotson was able
to continue the work of his father, Reverend
Richard Dotson, to keep the marsh a natural
place for everyone in the community to enjoy.
Director Dotson has been described by his
colleagues as tirelessly pursuing environ-
mental protections in his community.
Director Dotson’s service extends beyond
his work with the East Bay Regional Park Dis-
trict. He is the president of the North Rich-
mond Shoreline Open Space Alliance, Asso-
ciate Director of the Neighborhood House of
North Richmond, and Vice Chair of the Com-
munity Advisory Group. Throughout his tenure
with the East Bay Regional Park District and
through his philanthropic work, Director
Dotson has fought to preserve open space
and ensure a clean and healthy environment
for generations to come.
Director Dotson departs the East Bay Re-
gional Park District with a legacy of cham-
pioning the environmental well-being of his
community. We wish him great luck and joy in
retirement.

IN HONOR OF LADY LIBERTY DAY
HON. LANCE GOODEN
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, December 5, 2019
Mr. GOODEN. Madam Speaker, the fol-
lowing Proclamation is in honor of Lady Lib-
erty Day:
Whereas, in 1986, the City started planning,
a pavilion that would showcase three flag
poles—one for the American flag, the State
flag and initially the Texas Sesquicentennial
flag; and
Whereas, the pavilion was to provide a base
structure for the placement of the Lady Liberty
statue and to light flag poles at night; and
Whereas, on December 7, 1986, with a
deep sense of pride in our state’s heritage,
Forney held its Sesquicentennial Flag Dedica-
tion ceremony commemorating a new City
landmark and gateway to the City; and
Whereas, due to highway reconfiguration
and construction, the monument and flag
poles had to be taken down until they could
be placed in a new location; and
Whereas, today, 33 years later, the City is
proud to be able to re-dedicate the redesigned
and rebuilt Lady Liberty Monument, bringing
back a much-loved City landmark and gate-
way to the City; therefore, be it
Resolved, I, Lance Gooden, representative
of the 5th District of Texas, do hereby recog-
nize the 7th day of December 2019, as Lady
Liberty Day.

RECOGNIZING ILLINOIS STATE
TROOPER TODD HANNEKEN OF
ILLINOIS STATE POLICE DIS-
TRICT 10
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, December 5, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize Illinois State Trooper Todd
Hanneken for his heroic service on May 8,
2018. On that day Trooper Todd Hanneken
was on the scene of a previous accident on
the northbound lane of Interstate 57 when
suddenly a semi-truck slammed into the last
vehicle in line. The vehicle, driven by Andrew
Bergan, burst into flames as it was thrust for-
ward into the car in front of it. When Mr.
Bergan’s truck came to rest, the cab was en-
gulfed in flames and its doors were blocked.
As others attempted to keep the fire at bay,
Trooper Hanneken kicked out the windshield
and, with the help of two others, pulled Mr.
Bergan to safety. The quick response saved
Mr. Bergan’s life.
In recognition of Trooper Hanneken’s ac-
tions that day, he was awarded the Medal of
Honor on October 30, 2019. This honor is
awarded to Illinois State Police personnel who
‘‘perform a heroic act that by its nature results
in saving a life, preventing a serious crime or
apprehending a person who committed a seri-
ous crime.’’ Since the events of May 8, 2018,
Trooper Hanneken has called Mr. Bergan sev-
eral times, visited the hospital and met with
his parents, while Mr. Bergan was present for
the awarding of the Medal of Honor.
Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure I
stand to recognize Trooper Todd Hanneken
for his heroism. His dedication to duty and to
his fellow man is an inspiration to us all. I wish
him the very best, along with all of the sur-
vivors of the crash that day.

and women who will go on to become leaders
in their local communities, states, and the na-
tion in the areas of business, education, law,
government, philanthropy, the arts and culture,
and the military.
We know this because we see them and
benefit from their contributions every day.
Many of them work for us in our offices as jun-
ior staff members, congressional fellows, or in-
terns and they do amazing work for and on
behalf of the constituents we are privileged to
represent.
Madam Speaker, I believe there is no higher
calling than the call to serve a cause larger
than ourselves. That is why I ran for public of-
fice. I was inspired to serve by President Ken-
nedy who said, ‘‘Ask not what your country
can do for you, ask what you can do for your
country,’’ and by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. who said:
‘‘Everybody can be great because anybody
can serve. . . . You only need a heart full of
grace. A soul generated by love.’’
By this measure, there are several other
great young men and women who served as
volunteers this year in my offices. They may
toil in obscurity but their contributions to the
constituents we serve are deeply appreciated.
That is why today I rise to pay tribute to three
extraordinary young persons for their service
to my constituents in the 18th Congressional
District of Texas and to the American people.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, December 5, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to celebrate the 100th birthday of Hatsuko
‘‘Susie’’ Kusaka from the City of Anaheim,
California.
Born on November 14, 1919 in Rexburg,
Idaho, Mrs. Kusaka has lived a rich life: rais-
ing a family, tending to crops of potatoes and
strawberries, and caring for guests at the
Disneyland Hotel.
Susie spent most of her childhood in South-
ern California and Japan. After marrying
Shuichi Kusaka, she moved to Idaho Falls,
Idaho, where she and her husband ran a po-
tato farm. During that time, their four chil-
dren—Warren, Alice, Ted, and Naomi—were
born.
In 1953, the family moved to California, set-
tling in Anaheim, where they made a living as
strawberry farmers.
In 1978, at age 59, Susie began a second
career with Disneyland Hotel. In 1987, she
was named national ‘‘Room Keeper of the
Year’’ by the American Hotel Association. She
retired in 2009 after 22 years of hard work and
dedication. In June of 2016, she moved into
Walnut Village Retirement Community in Ana-
heim.
Along with enjoying her community’s many
amenities, she delights in visits from her family
members, including her grandson, Brian, and
a granddaughter-in-law, Katharine.
Please join me in wishing my constituent,
Susie Hatsuko a happy 100th birthday and
many more years of good health and happi-
ness.

RECOGNIZING JOHN DITSLEAR
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, December 5, 2019
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize John Ditslear on his
retirement from the Office of Mayor of
Noblesville, Indiana. A well-respected public
servant, Mayor Ditslear’s career has been de-
fined by his steadfast leadership of
Noblesville. His many decades of public serv-
ice in a number of different roles has greatly
impacted the community and its citizens.
A native son of Dublin, Ohio, Mayor Distlear
graduated from my alma mater, Miami Univer-
sity in Oxford, Ohio, with a degree in finance.
After graduation, Mayor Ditslear chose to
serve his country by joining the United States
Navy. Serving in the early 1960s, at a time of
tumultuous international relations, Mayor
Ditslear and his fellow sailors were tasked with
transporting their Marine and Army counter-
parts to active theaters in Vietnam. During this
time in the United States Navy, Mayor Ditslear
rose to the rank of lieutenant while developing
his leadership and situational management
skills.
After completing his naval service, Mayor
Ditslear moved to Noblesville in 1966, where
he invested a great deal of time in his commu-
nity as a volunteer. He served as a board
member for many community organizations in-
cluding the Chamber of Commerce,
Noblesville Boys & Girls Club, Riverview Hos-
pital Foundation, Hamilton East Public Library
and the United Way of Hamilton County. Ever
the leader, Mayor Ditslear is also a past presi-
dent of the Indiana Association of Cities and
Towns, the Noblesville Redevelopment Com-
mission, the Life Underwriter’s Association and
the Indianapolis chapter of Chartered Life Un-
derwriters. It is clear that Mayor Ditslear’s
service to the citizens of Noblesville has
reached far beyond his time in public office.
After his service in the Navy, Mayor Ditslear
entered into the business world joining the
American United Life Insurance Company in
Indianapolis. His success in the insurance
business led him to start his own company
Ditslear Insurance, with offices in Indianapolis
and Noblesville. After many prosperous years,
Ditslear Insurance merged into the Ditslear
Elmer Group, where success continued.
Mayor Ditslear made his initial foray into
elected office with three terms on the
Noblesville School Board, from 1984 to 1992
and then again from 2000 to 2004. This expe-
rience helped to prepare Mayor Ditslear for
the rigors of serving in higher public office.
When the opportunity presented itself in 2003,
he chose to run for mayor of Noblesville, a
race that he would go on to win against four
general election opponents.
After assuming the Office of Mayor of
Noblesville in 2004, and later joining the Re-
publican Party, Mayor Ditslear would lead the
city in continued growth over his four terms
and became the longest tenured mayor in the
history of Noblesville. His successful steward-
ship of the local economy has had major im-
pacts on both the operations of the city and its
citizens. Since 2004, the assessed value of
the taxable property increased 134 percent
from $2.4 billion to $6.04 billion today. By
2016, the population of Noblesville grew by
over 10,000 people to more than 60,000 resi-
dents. This growth led to the school system
adding additional schools to support the
younger population and helping to improve ac-
cess to education.
Mayor Ditslear led several quality of life ini-
tiatives, resulting in the development of Ham-
ilton Town Center, and Federal Commons in
addition to four new parks. Mayor Ditslear also
worked to increase the amount of outdoor
walking trails 183 percent by extending the
Midland Trace Trail from Westfield to the cen-
ter of Noblesville. His focus on the heart of the
city also included renovating the downtown
area through facade grants and road improve-
ments and a focus on the White River. The
Riverwalk Trail project provides a walkway
down to the White River and provides citizens

the opportunity to enjoy nature. Mayor Ditslear
was also instrumental in attracting SMC, a
Japanese pneumatic technology company, to
make a massive investment in the Noblesville
community creating over 600 new jobs by lo-
cating their North American headquarters to
the city.
As Noblesville continued to grow and ex-
pand to new heights under Mayor Ditslear’s
leadership, the Mayor and his team also led
initiatives with fellow civic leaders and local
business owners to maintain the vitality and
attractiveness of downtown Noblesville. A
long-time sector of commerce in the city, and
the location of the Hamilton County Seat since
1824, downtown Noblesville has been the epi-
center of Hamilton County since its inception.
Working with groups such as Noblesville Main
Street and various local businesses, Mayor
Ditslear was able to encourage continued
growth and revitalization of downtown
Noblesville. Initiatives such as First Fridays,
Jazz on the Square, and Small Business Sat-
urdays, helped to build a sense of community
that has made downtown Noblesville the focal
point of life in the city once again.
By focusing on the infrastructure of the city,
improving parks and community spaces, pro-
moting quality education, and even playing a
role in founding the Roots of Life Community
Church with his wife, Head Pastor Teri
Ditslear, Mayor Ditslear has impacted his city
as both a government official and a com-
mitted, longtime resident.
On behalf of all Hoosiers, I thank Mayor
Ditslear for his many years of service to the
city and people of Noblesville, Indiana. I wish
him, his wife and fellow civic leader, Pastor
Teri Ditslear, and his family the best in a well-
deserved retirement.

HONORING MAJOR JEREMY PARR
HON. C.A. DUTCH RUPPERSBERGER
OF MARYLAND
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, December 5, 2019
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Madam Speaker, I
rise to pay tribute to Major Jeremy Parr for his
exemplary dedication to duty and service as
an Army Congressional Fellow and Congres-
sional Budget Liaison for the Assistant Sec-
retary of the Army (Financial Management and
Comptroller). Major Parr is transitioning from
his current assignment to serve as a Battalion
Operations Officer at Fort Hood, Texas.
Hailing from Corpus Christi, Texas, Major
Parr was commissioned as a Second Lieuten-
ant in the Signal Corps from Army ROTC in
2007. He earned a Bachelor’s Degree in In-
dustrial Distribution from Texas A&M Univer-
sity and a Master’s Degree in Legislative Af-
fairs from The George Washington University.
Major Parr served in a broad range of as-
signments during his 12 years as an Army offi-
cer. He has served in one combat deployment
to Iraq with Task Force 2–16 Infantry, 4th Bri-
gade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division.
I had the privilege of working with Major
Parr, who served as a fellow in my office,
throughout 2017 and during his succeeding
assignment as a Congressional Budget Liai-
son for the U.S. Army. Major Parr diligently
coordinated with Members of Congress and
their staffs to articulate the Army’s budget po-
sitions to the Appropriations Committees. His
professionalism, performance and commitment
to the mission, as both a fellow and liaison,
are in keeping with the highest traditions of
military service and made a lasting impression
on members and staff of the United States
Congress.
Throughout his career, Major Parr has posi-
tively impacted soldiers, peers and superiors.
Our country has benefited from his leadership,
judgment and passion for the Army profession.
The foundation of Jeremy’s success is his
family. His wife, Yulia, and his children, Josh-
ua, Evan and Alexander, are the light of his
life. In addition, Jeremy’s parents, Debra and
Earl, exemplify the selflessness and humility
that characterize the families of all of our serv-
ice members.
Madam Speaker, it has been a genuine
pleasure to have worked with Major Jeremy
Parr since the first session of the 115th Con-
gress. It is with great appreciation that I recog-
nize and commend Jeremy for service to our
country and wish him all the best as he con-
tinues his service in the United States Army.

TRIBUTE TO THE LOBOSCO
ASSOCIATION
HON. MIKIE SHERRILL
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, December 5, 2019
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor and recognize the history of the
Lobosco Association, which will celebrate the
60th Lobosco Association Christmas Party on
December 8, 2019 in Fredon, New Jersey.
Four generations will gather to celebrate the
strength of their family. They remain bound by
the ideals of the first Loboscos who immi-
grated to this great nation and, through their
sacrifices, enabled their descendants to attain
the American Dream.
The Association has helped the Loboscos
support one another, gather together, and
strengthen the bonds of family. Family has
been a constant throughout the years. The As-
sociation’s dedication to Italian-American his-
tory and culture has kept its members deeply-
rooted to their shared ties and able to con-
tinue growing towards the future.
The Association began on April 28, 1957,
when the descendants of Michele and
Vincenza Lobosco first organized the group.
They formed the Lobosco Association to
strengthen the bonds of family and lend sup-
port to one another. The family’s journey to
Paterson, New Jersey, began with the early
death of the family’s patriarch, Michele. From
their humble beginnings in Sala Consilina,
Italy, seven of the ten surviving children came
to Paterson to establish new roots and provide
their children with greater opportunities. An-
gelo came in 1912 at age 19, followed by
Rosario, Michele, Luigi, Giuseppina, Attilio,
and Emilio. They overcame language barriers
and limited resources in a country that consid-
ered them foreigners. Their family cohesion,
drive, and determination helped them to per-
severe and lay a foundation for a prosperous
future for their descendants. As the family
grew, the Association was formed to help
maintain the close ties they shared.
To keep the family together, the Association
has organized various festivities, picnics, and
trips, the most enduring of which is now the
annual Christmas Party. Since the first one on
December 21, 1958, the Lobosco Association
Christmas Party has been an opportunity for
generations of Lobosco family members to
share in the joy of the season and family com-
pany. For 60 years, the descendants of
Michele and Vincenza have continued the tra-
dition of a Christmas Party to instill in younger
generations an appreciation for the meaning of
family. They come to connect with seldom-
seen family members, meet new ones, cele-
brate their heritage, instill pride, and keep the
family spirit alive.
As Members of Congress, we have the
deeply rewarding opportunity to learn about
and recognize groups like the Lobosco Asso-
ciation. They represent great American stories.
Their contributions have strengthened this
country for many years and will continue to
strengthen it for many years to come.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in this
chamber to join me in recognizing the mem-
bers and friends of the Lobosco Association
and wishing them a joyous 60th Lobosco As-
sociation Christmas Party this holiday season.

OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, December 5, 2019
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the service of an esteemed
leader in Contra Costa, Jerry Brown.
After a decade of leadership at the Contra
Costa Water District (CCWD) where he served
the people of our county, Jerry will be leaving
at the end of the year. His 18 years at CCWD
were supported by his strong educational
background in mechanical engineering, civil
engineering, and business administration.
Prior to joining us in the Bay Area, Jerry start-
ed his career with the Los Angeles Depart-
ment of Water and Power.
During his tenure with CCWD, Jerry held
various leadership positions and was ap-
pointed General Manager in September 2010.
Throughout his career, he has worked in the
water planning industry to ensure the proper
management of water system facilities and se-
cure water quality and supply to the public.
Jerry has influenced state and federal water
policy through his participation on various
boards and committees such as the Bay Area
Council, the Association of Metropolitan Water
Agencies, and the California Urban Water
Agencies. Above all, Jerry has placed his
focus on customer service. Some of his nota-
ble achievements during his time with CCWD
include constructing resilient and climate-
adapted facilities and cultivating a strong safe-
ty culture within the organization.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTH-
DAY OF FRANCES BARBER
MCCOMMONS
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, December 5, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to celebrate the 100th birthday of Frances
Barber McCommons from the City of Ana-
heim, California.
Born on November 10, 1919 in McCrory, Ar-
kansas, Frances has lived a rich and blessed
life filled with raising her five children and
serving others in her neighborhood and at her
church where she was a Sunday School
teacher of 4- and 5-year-olds for more than 50
years.
Frances spent her childhood in Arkansas as
the eldest of seven children. She graduated at
16 as class salutatorian. At 18, Frances mar-
ried her childhood sweetheart, J.R.
McCommons, and started life as a farmer’s
wife. Frances, J.R., and their first four children
were honored in 1949 as ‘‘The Farm Family of
the Year for Woodruff County.’’ Frances and
J.R. were married 58 years and were true life
partners.
In 1955, the family moved to California, set-
tling in Anaheim, where they lived in a neigh-
borhood in East Anaheim surrounded by or-
ange groves. It was here that they had an-
other child. All five of their children would later
attend and graduate from Anaheim High
School.
Frances and J.R. were lay leaders in the
Orange County Southern Baptist Association
and helped start two churches: Crescent
Southern Baptist Church in Anaheim and Lin-
coln Avenue Baptist Church in Orange.
In 1966, Frances and J.R.’s son, Michael
McCommons, was killed in Vietnam while
serving in the United States Army. He was
posthumously awarded The Bronze Star with
the V Device for Valor and Heroism in Combat
and The Purple Heart. As a Gold Star Mother,
Frances served veterans’ organizations and
worked with other Gold Star Mothers to sup-
port veterans and families of those who were
killed in service to their county.
For many years, Frances’s personal ministry
was encouraging and celebrating others’
achievements, birthdays, and other life events
through personal notes, cards, and letters.
Frances remained involved in the lives of the
children she taught in Sunday School and
continued to celebrate their lives with them
through adulthood.
Her life revolves around her immediate fam-
ily and her large extended family, including
eight grandchildren and eight great-grand-
children. She is still an avid reader and re-
mains interested in current events and the
news. As someone whose livelihood was once
dependent on the farm, Frances still loves
watching the changes in the weather.
Please join me in wishing my constituent,
Frances Barber McCommons, a happy 100th
birthday and many more years of good health
and happiness.

INTRODUCTION OF THE BANK
MERGER REVIEW MODERNIZA-
TION ACT
HON. JESÚS G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCÍA
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, December 5, 2019
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to support the Bank Merger Review
Modernization Act.
When big banks get bigger, consumers and
taxpayers usually end up losing.
Unprecedented concentration in the banking
sector is hurting consumers, who pay more for
critical financial services when their banks are
merged out of existence. Since the 1980s,
consolidation has swept the banking industry,
with the number of FDIC-insured banks in the
United States dropping from more than 15,000
in 1984 to less than 5,000 in 2018. Numerous
studies have shown that bank mergers are as-
sociated with higher costs of credit, reductions
in lending, and decreases in small business
formation and local property prices.
Concentration in the banking sector also
poses risks to financial stability. A wave of
bank mergers by Bank of America, Citigroup,
JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo in the late 1990s
created the ‘‘too-big-to-fail’’ banks that became
so central to the 2008 financial crisis.
Rather than scrutinizing the considerable
risks that bank mergers pose, the regulatory
agencies tasked with reviewing these mergers
have increasingly ‘‘rubber stamped’’ them.
Bank merger approval rates are at historic
highs.
Last month, the Federal Reserve and FDIC
approved the largest merger since the crash
when they gave the green light to the merger
between BB&T and SunTrust.
I am concerned that the reviewing agencies
are not giving adequate attention to the sys-
temic risks that these giant megabanks pose.
I am also concerned that the considerable
harms to consumers are not being considered
when mergers are reviewed. The Bank Merger
Review Modernization Act strengthens the
bank merger review process to give the CFPB
and consumers a voice, and to require that
the systemic costs of too big to fail institutions
are taken into full account.
I urge this body to curb the creation of too
big to fail banks and pass this bill.

RECOGNIZING CHRISTOPHER FOSS
HON. ERIC SWALWELL
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, December 5, 2019
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise to recognize the dutiful work of
my constituent, Dublin City Manager Chris-
topher Foss, on the occasion of his retirement
after nearly 40 years of service in local gov-
ernment.
Chris began his career in local government
as a deputy city manager for Burbank, Cali-
fornia, where he eventually served as the eco-
nomic development director. In these roles, he
enriched Burbank’s economy and local busi-
ness environment.
In 1999, Chris began serving as the eco-
nomic development director for my hometown
of Dublin. He implemented a variety of eco-
nomic development programs to bolster and
retain the business community. Under Chris,
Dublin’s economy flourished, and his work has
had a lasting impact on the economic endur-
ance and vitality of the Tri-Valley.
Chris served five years as assistant city
manager before being promoted to city man-
ager in 2014. His five-and-a-half-year tenure
as city manager can be characterized by his
superb relationship building, sound fiscal prac-
tices, and collaborative leadership style.
Under Chris’ leadership, Dublin vastly ex-
panded its network of parks, constructed a
new affordable housing project as well as key
commercial projects, and increased its foot-
print in the medical and biotech communities.
Our community also has Chris to thank for
the construction of several community facili-
ties. One such example is the School of
Imagination, to serve children with special
needs. The influx of new jobs and services
through these projects supports the sustain-
ability of economic progress in our community.
Chris draws support from his amazing fam-
ily. That network includes his loving wife Lisa,
son Jordan, daughter-in-law Lizzie, and grand-
son Henry.
I want to thank Chris for the contributions he
has made to the communities he has served,
especially Dublin. His passionate leadership
and enduring commitment to our community
are very much appreciated.

RECOGNIZING JERRY REVISH
HON. JOYCE BEATTY
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, December 5, 2019
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, on behalf
of the residents of Ohio’s Third Congressional
District, I salute Jerry Revish on his illustrious
broadcasting career of 42 years.
In 1972, Jerry got his start in his hometown
of Youngstown, Ohio at WBBW Radio and in
June 1980 he became a reporter for WBNS–
TV.
Over the course of his more than four dec-
ades in journalism, Jerry won 13 Emmy
awards, four Edward R. Murrow Awards, and
the Silver Circle Award from the National
Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
In addition, he was recognized by the Asso-
ciated Press for best feature, best documen-
tary and best spot news coverage; honored
with the Carl Day Award for Outstanding
Achievement; and was the recipient of the
Best International Reporting Award from the
National Association of Black Journalists for a
series of reports on the liberation of Haiti and
a half-hour documentary on the new South Af-
rica.
His reporting skills have taken him around
the world.
He was the first Columbus TV reporter to go
to Saudi Arabia to cover the Persian Gulf War,
and he has reported from Haiti, Barbados,
South Africa, Bosnia, Bahrain, Cuba, and
Japan.
Among his numerous career highlights,
Jerry covered many national political conven-
tions, Ohio State University bowl games, the
dedication of the Vietnam War Memorial Wall,
the Lucasville State Prison Riot, and the Sep-
tember 11th terrorist attack. He also inter-
viewed President Barack Obama and helped
Columbus bodybuilder Walter Smith—wrong-
fully convicted of rape—win his freedom
through DNA testing.
In 2005, Jerry was inducted into the Ohio
Broadcasters Hall of Fame.
Outside of the newsroom, Jerry is the
founder and senior pastor of the Unity Temple
Church of God in Christ in Columbus, Ohio
alongside his wife of 45 years, Danielle.
As he signs off at 10TV, I salute Jerry
Revish for his commitment to excellence and
service to Central Ohio—and wish him all the
best as he begins the next chapter of his life.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF SEBASTIAN J. ARESCO
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, December 5, 2019
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, It is with
the heaviest of hearts that I rise today to join
the many family, friends, and colleagues who
have gathered to pay tribute to a very special
member of the Middlefield, Connecticut com-
munity, Sebastian J. Aresco, who lost his bat-
tle with cancer late last week. Public servant,
veteran, friend, and mentor, Seb’s loss will be
felt by many.
Born in Middletown, Connecticut, Seb was a
member of the United States Air Force and
proudly served our country with distinction dur-
ing the Vietnam War. He did not speak a lot
about his time in the service, however, he
spent countless hours with his fellow veterans
throughout his life. He could often be found at
events and programs sponsored by the local
VFW. Seb was also very dedicated member of
the Saint Colman Church community. In his
professional life, Seb was a proud employee
of the State of Connecticut—an auditor with
the State Treasurer’s office for several dec-
ades before his retirement just a few years
ago. In his spare time, he could often be
found at the shore, enjoying a day of fishing,
grabbing a lobster or whole belly clam roll at

Seb took great pride in his military and state
service, but he was perhaps best known for
his work in the political arena. He was raised
to understand the importance of our political
process and his life experiences highlighted
them even more so. He wanted to make a dif-
ference in his community, and he did so
through the art of politics. He served on var-
ious Boards and Commissions in Middlefield,
but it was his leadership as the Chair of the
local Democratic Party—a position which he
held for more than thirty years—where Seb
excelled. Seb was one of those rare individ-
uals who volunteered his time, energy, and
even his home to ensure that every member
of his community was encouraged to partici-
pate in the political process. He was a mentor
to many as they became involved in local gov-
ernment and navigated elected office. He also
had a unique understanding of how local,
state, and federal government could work to-
gether to improve the quality of life for all.
Though Middlefield is one of the smaller com-
munities in Connecticut, Seb’s dedication, pas-
sion, and commitment earned him the respect
and admiration of political leaders across the
state.
Put simply, Seb was one of the good ones.
He had a quiet strength and heart of gold. I,
like so many others, consider myself fortunate
to have known him and to have called him my
friend. He will be deeply missed by family,
friends, and the community to which he dedi-
cated so much of his time and energies. His
tireless efforts as a veteran, state employee,
and community leader made a real difference
in the lives of others and I am honored to
have this opportunity to stand and pay tribute
to the life and legacy of Sebastian J. Aresco.
I extend my deepest sympathies to his daugh-
ters, Amanda and Andrea, as well as his long-
time companion, Joan, at this most difficult
time, and hope that they can find comfort in
knowing that Seb’s legacy of public service,
generosity, and kindness will continue to in-
spire all of those privileged enough to have
known him.

CELEBRATING RIVER ROUGE HIGH
SCHOOL FOOTBALL’S STATE
CHAMPIONSHIP
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, December 5, 2019
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
give a hearty congratulations to the River
Rouge High School Football on winning their
first-ever state championship.
In a dramatic game, the River Rouge Pan-
thers prevailed over setbacks early on to de-
feat a formidable opponent. This hard-earned
victory is a testament to the countless hours of
training put in by this dedicated team, as well
as the support of its coaches and parents. As
legendary basketball Coach Phil Jackson once
said, ‘‘The strength of the team is each indi-
vidual member. The strength of each member
is the team.’’
Please join me in recognizing the River
Rouge High School football team, Coach
Corey Parker for this outstanding accomplish-
ment.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF SEAN
CASEY
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, December 5, 2019
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the service of long-time
community advocate, Sean Casey as he be-
gins retirement.
Sean Casey has dedicated his life and ca-
reer to children and families. After graduating
from Oberlin College and getting his master’s
degrees from UC Berkeley in both social wel-
fare and public health, Sean worked at UC
San Francisco, developing better data and
analysis for maternal and child health pro-
grams. He also created Fetal/Infant Mortality
Review programs in Contra Costa and Ala-
meda Counties.
Quickly after joining First 5, Sean became
Contra Costa’s Executive Director. Throughout
his tenure, First 5 Contra Costa provided life-
changing services to over 500 families.
While he was Executive Director, Sean
oversaw the development of a county-wide
preschool planning process which imple-
mented a Quality Rating and Improvement
System. He supported the development of
three parent advocacy groups, which identified
and addressed issues related to early child-
hood development including affordable hous-
ing, immigrant and racial justice, and the safe-
ty of neighborhood parks.
Sean also worked to establish Contra Costa
County’s Help Me Grow system to help par-
ents identify potential developmental chal-
lenges their children may have and connect
them with the necessary resources and serv-
ices. He also developed Ready Kids, which
helps young children prepare for kindergarten
and their academic lives. On top of that, he
helped establish the Children’s Leadership
Council, the Family Economic Security Part-
nership, the Early Learning Leadership Group,
the Budget Justice Coalition, and the Contra
Costa Funders Forum. Sean also served as
the Chair of the First 5 Association.
Sean has always been a leader in the com-
munity and someone I have enjoyed working
with greatly. Over my years in public service,
I have visited First 5 and many of the other
programs he is associated with and am al-
ways impressed by the impact he has on the
children and families he works with. As he re-
tires from First 5, we wish him well knowing
that his legacy will continue to enrich the lives
of Contra Costa families. We wish him great
luck and joy in retirement.

HONORING THE CAREER OF
GEORGE WOLFBERG
HON. TED LIEU
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, December 5, 2019
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to celebrate Mr. George Wolfberg, a
longtime community leader in California’s 33rd
Congressional District who will receive the
Pride of the Palisades award from the Pacific
Palisades Community Council. George worked
for the City of Los Angeles for 37 years and
played a hand in its bid for the 1984 Summer
Olympics, divestment from South Africa over
apartheid, and rewriting of the city charter.
Born on April 22, 1938 to Bernard Wolfberg
and Leah Wolfberg, George was raised in Los
Angeles, attending Los Angeles High School
and the University of California, Los Angeles,
where he received his degree in political
science. George and his wife, Diane, married
on February 9, 1964 and went on to have
three children: Anya, David, and Michael, and
four grandchildren.
George began working for the city of Los
Angeles in 1961 in the City Administrative Of-
fice, where he eventually rose to Chief Admin-
istrative Analyst, the highest non-appointed
position in the office. In that role, he prepared
Los Angeles’ successful bid for the 1984 Sum-
mer Olympics and worked to ensure infra-
structure upgrades were completed for the
event. He also administered the City’s anti-
apartheid program, overseeing the research
necessary to ensure successful divestment
from South Africa under apartheid. Even after
he retired, George continued to play an out-
sized role in city government, serving as City
Charter Commission Research Director and
co-authoring the City’s administrative code.
The neighborhood of Pacific Palisades in
some ways owes George a debt for its devel-
opment. George helped craft and implement
the Los Angeles Community Plan that has
guided the growth and land use of Pacific Pali-
sades and will for years to come. In addition
to serving as Chair, Chair-Emeritus, and Vice
Chair on the Pacific Palisades Community
Council, he served on the board of the Santa
Monica Canyon Civic Association and Portrero
Canyon Park citizens advisory committee, call-
ing attention to the importance of proper land-
scape design and infrastructure. Even from his
bed in the ICU this past September, George
has been contacting Los Angeles city staff and
officials to support a new park in his neighbor-
hood.
George’s passion for engaging the youth is
evident through his work on the Los Angeles
County Bicycle Advisory Committee, service
as a Watts Friendship Sports League commis-
sioner following the 1992 riots, and efforts with
the local American Youth Soccer Organization,
where he was a National Referee still over-
seeing games as recently as last year. George
has also received numerous awards for his
volunteer work, including the Pacific Palisades
Community Council’s Citizen of the Year
award in 2011.
George’s impact in Los Angeles and Pacific
Palisades is remarkable and inspiring. I want
to thank and recognize George for his efforts
to improve his community and outstanding
leadership throughout his career.

INTRODUCTION OF H. RES. 742
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, December 5, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
mark the important successes of the Food for
Peace Act. Since 1954, Food for Peace has
provided life-saving food assistance to some
of the world’s most vulnerable people. While it
has already saved the lives of millions, there
is more work to be done. Tens of millions of
children suffer from the effects of malnutrition,
while natural disasters, civil strife and other
crises put food supplies at risk every year.
I have introduced H. Res. 742 to mark these
important achievements and call for continued
appropriations prioritization of Food for Peace.
This resolution has strong bipartisan support
and also the support of a number of interested
organizations, including Action Against Hun-
ger, Alliance to End Hunger, American Mari-
time Congress, American Maritime Officers,
American Maritime Officers Service, American
Soybean Association, Bread for the World,
Breedlove Foods, Inc., Bunge, CARE USA,
Cargill, Incorporated, Didion Milling, Edesia,
Feed the Children, Food for the Hungry, Inter-
Action, Land O’Lakes Venture37, Land
O’Lakes, Inc., Maritime Institute for Research
and Industrial Development (MIRAID), Mas-
ters, Mates & Pilots Union, National Associa-
tion of Wheat Growers, National Corn Growers
Association, National Milk Producers Federa-
tion, Navy League of the United States, Sea-
farers International Union, The Borgen Project,

PAYING TRIBUTE TO FRED
HAMPTON AND MARK CLARK
SPEECH OF
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, December 4, 2019
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise to honor the legacy of Fred Hampton.
Mr. Hampton was only 21 years old when
he was murdered by the Chicago Police De-
partment and the FBI as he slept in his bed-
room. The Chicago Police fired between 82
and 99 rounds into his apartment the night of
his murder.
Although we lost a powerful fighter for jus-
tice on December 4, 1969, Mr. Hampton’s
commitment to social, racial, and economic
justice and his legacy of helping the
disenfranchised did not die with him.
Working predominately on the South and
West Sides of Chicago, Mr. Hampton and the
Black Panther Party provided free medical
services and implemented a free lunch pro-
gram that fed 4,000 children daily. These so-
cial programs were valuable resources to
these underserved communities.
The Black Panther Movement shed a spot
light on the disparities between the races. Mr.
Hampton understood that many of the social
injustices stemmed from an unjust political
system and fought hard to change it.
Mr. Hampton’s cruel murder was the cata-
lyst for a political awakening that resulted in
the unprecedented election of several African-
American mayors like Harold Washington of
Chicago in 1983; Wilson Goode of Philadel-
phia in 1984; Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore in
1988; and David Dinkins of New York City in
1989.
Mr. Hampton was the champion for the dis-
advantaged and I am proud to honor his leg-
acy.
