IT IS TIME TO PROVIDE
STABILITY TO DACA RECIPIENTS
(Mr. HARDER of California asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute and to revise
and extend his remarks.)
(English translation of the statement
made in Spanish is as follows:)
Mr. HARDER of California. Madam
Speaker, I demand that the Senate
take action with respect to the Dream
Act.
I was proud to vote this week to ap-
prove this law because it is time to
provide stability to the recipients of
DACA.
The Dreamers are our friends and
neighbors.
They are Americans in every sense of
the word—except on paper.
I had the honor to be a professor at a
college in my district, Modesto Junior
College.
One of my young students was study-
ing to be a pharmacist.
But because her family had brought
her here when she was only three
months old, her future is at stake.
Stories like hers are common, espe-
cially in my district, in the Central
Valley.
More than 10,000 young people are eli-
gible to receive their citizenship by the
Dream Act.
Dreamers deserve this opportunity.
It is time to pass the Dream Act.
Presidenta de la Cámara de
Representantes, exijo que el Senado
tome acción al respecto a la ‘‘Dream
Act’’.
Con orgullo, esta semana voté para
aprobar esta ley porque ya es tiempo de
darles seguridad a los recipientes de
DACA.
Los Dreamers son nuestros amigos y
vecinos.
Son americanos en todo el sentido de
la palabra—menos en un papel.
Tuve el honor de ser un profesor en
un colegio en mi distrito, Modesto Jun-
ior College.
Una de mis estudiantes era una joven
que estaba estudiando para ser
farmacéutica.
Pero como su familia la trajo a este
paı́s cuando tenı́a solo tres meses, su
futuro está en peligro.
Historias como la suya son comunes,
especialmente en mi distrito en el
Valle Central de California.
Más de diez mil jóvenes son elegibles
para recibir ciudadanı́a con La ‘‘Dream
Act.’’
Los Dreamers merecen esta
oportunidad. Es tiempo para pasar la
‘‘Dream Act.’’

FLETCHER). The gentleman from Cali-

lation of his remarks.

HONORING OSCAR NIPPS, JR.
(Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor
my June Veteran of the Month, Mr.
Oscar Nipps, Jr., and to share his
American hero story.
Mr. Nipps served as a rifleman, com-
pany cook, and sergeant with the 1st
Calvary division during World War II,
liberating thousands of civilians from
the Santo Tomas Internment Camp. He
continued fighting alongside the Allied
forces to liberate the Philippines and
was on a ship headed to the front lines
of the Japan invasion when victory was
declared over Japan in 1945.
At 92 years old, he continues to be a
leader and public servant as a volun-
teer at the Military History Museum in
Broken Arrow. In fact, the city has
even named two streets in his honor.

He is a familiar face at the museum,
where he shares his stories of the brave
men and women he fought beside and
friends he lost during the war.
Mr. Nipps’ bravery will never be for-
gotten, and I am grateful for the work
he continues to do to serve this great
country and share the stories of those
who fought for justice and peace. I am
honored to name him the First Dis-
trict’s Veteran of the Month for June.

HONORING EDDIE JONES, II
(Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, today I pay tribute to the life
and legacy of a selfless community
servant, Eddie Jones, II, who passed
away last week at the much-too-soon
age of 69.
Eddie was truly remarkable and ex-
emplified the best in us. He was a
steady hand for anyone who needed it
and a sturdy presence who dedicated
himself to being a good steward of our
Chicagoland community.
Born in Arkansas to Eddie and Rosie
Jones, Eddie grew up in Chicago’s
Bronzeville neighborhood, graduating
from Wendell Phillips High School and
Western Illinois University before em-
barking on a 30-year career with IBM
and All Points Security.
Eddie was chairman of the Iota Delta
Lambda Educational Foundation, the
March of Dimes, and served as the
president of the Chicago Urban League
Metro Board. He was a proud brother of
Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity and made
sure we all knew it. He was even
prouder to be a grandfather and a fa-
ther.
I am thankful to have called Eddie
my friend, and I am comforted and in-
spired by the fact that his life and leg-
acy endure in the memory, smiles, and
service of others.
On behalf of a thankful Second Con-
gressional District I say: We will miss
you, Eddie. Thank you for a life well
lived.
f
ENSURING STUDENTS A SAFE
COLLEGIATE EXPERIENCE
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak
about a bill to eradicate hazing on col-
lege campuses.
This morning, Congresswoman
MARCIA FUDGE will introduce the END
ALL Hazing Act. I am proud to lead
this bill with her to increase
campuswide transparency and account-
ability for all student organizations.
For too long, hazing has threatened
the health and the safety of students
and undermined the educational mis-
sion of higher education institutions.
No student on any campus should
have their well-being put in jeopardy
because of a dangerous and life-threat-
ening situation as part of a sports team
or a club ritual.
Parents who have lost children to in-
cidents of hazing have been working
with fraternities and sororities to en-
gage in aggressive student education,
outreach, and advocacy efforts to end
tragic hazing incidents. Their work has
included successfully pursuing legisla-
tion with transparency requirements in
several States, including my home
State of Pennsylvania.
A Federal solution will more quickly
address the problem and ensure stu-
dents across the country can enjoy a
safe collegiate experience with involve-
ment in extracurricular activities and
student organizations without fear of
being hazed.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill.
f
RECOGNIZING WOMEN VETERANS
(Ms. BROWNLEY of California asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute.)
Ms. BROWNLEY of California.
Madam Speaker, yesterday was Women
Veterans Day in my home State of
California, also home to 145,000 women
veterans.
Seventy-one years ago, President
Truman signed the Women’s Armed
Services Integration Act of 1948. This
law recognized women’s enduring and
critical service to the Nation and made
them permanent members of the
United States Armed Forces.
As chairwoman of the Women’s Vet-
erans Task Force, I am working with 66
of my colleagues in the House, as well
as in the Senate, to increase visibility
of women veterans. We are promoting
inclusivity and equitable access to
healthcare, benefits, education, and
economic opportunity, particularly in
the Department of Veterans Affairs.
I ask all Americans to join me in rec-
ognizing the 2 million women who have
served our country in uniform. To
these women veterans I say: Thank you
for your service to our great Nation.
f
STOPPING THE INVASION AT OUR
BORDER
(Mr. GOHMERT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, this
past week, we were privileged to have
been invited by our Speaker, those of
us who have been in the military,
served our country in the military, to
go with her to the 75th anniversary of
Normandy. It was deeply moving. And
to be on those beaches and to see and
know the sacrifices that occurred
there, we talked in terms of it being an
invasion over and over.
Now I get back to Texas and I found
out, last month, about the same num-
ber, about 144,000 invaded France, is
what we had last month here in Amer-
ica—just right here, even, in Texas. We
are being invaded by people who do not
know how to preserve a self-govern-
ment.
Ben Franklin said: It is a Republic,
madam, if you can keep it.
If we don’t stop the invasion, we will
not keep it.
f
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 962,
BORN-ALIVE ABORTION SUR-
VIVORS PROTECTION ACT
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged
from further consideration of H.R. 962,
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Pro-
tection Act, and ask for its immediate
consideration in the House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been
cleared by the bipartisan floor and
committee leaderships.
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I
urge the immediate scheduling of that
bill for a vote here.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has not been recognized for de-
bate.

TAKING ACTION AGAINST OUR NA-
TION’S GUN VIOLENCE EPIDEMIC
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute.)
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New
York. Madam Speaker, yesterday was
the third anniversary of the Pulse
nightclub shooting. Three years ago, 49
young people were senselessly mur-
dered and 53 more were wounded.
In the 3 years since then, approxi-
mately 120,000 more Americans have
died from our Nation’s gun violence
epidemic, and our Nation has failed to
take any meaningful action. Just re-
cently, we witnessed another mass
shooting in Virginia Beach that killed
12 people—12 innocent people.
And yet Congress has yet to pass
commonsense measures to save lives,
measures that 90 percent of Americans
support like universal background
checks and bans on massacre-sized
magazines and silencers.
H.R. 8, passed by the House more
than 100 days ago, still awaits action in
the Senate.
How many more tragic anniversaries
must pass—how many must die—before
we offer more than thoughts and pray-
ers?

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
further consideration of the bill (H.R.
2740) making appropriations for the De-
partments of Labor, Health and Human
Services, and Education, and related
agencies for the fiscal year ending Sep-
tember 30, 2020, and for other purposes,
with Mrs. FLETCHER (Acting Chair) in
the chair.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The Acting CHAIR. When the Com-
mittee of the Whole rose on Thursday,
June 13, 2019, a request for a recorded
vote on amendment No. 71 printed in
House Report 116–109 offered by the
gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.

The Chair understands that amend-
ment Nos. 72 and 73 will not be offered.

AMENDMENT NO. 74 OFFERED BY MS.
SPANBERGER
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 74 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Chair, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 51, line 11, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(increased by $3,000,000)’’.
Page 90, line 6, after the first dollar
amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $3,000,000)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentlewoman
from Virginia (Ms. SPANBERGER) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Virginia.
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Chair,
my amendment to H.R. 2740 increases
funding toward colorectal cancer
screening and prevention.
Right now, colorectal cancer is the
second leading cause of cancer death in
the United States. This year alone,
more than 50,000 people across the
country are expected to die from this
disease. One out of 20 Americans will
be diagnosed with colorectal cancer
during their lifetime.
When I hear these statistics, I think
of more than just the numbers. I think
of the families and the lives that are
impacted. I think of my own mother-
in-law who was diagnosed with
colorectal cancer years ago and re-
mains cancer-free to this day. I think
of my dear friend Peg—a teacher, an
advocate, and a fighter—who, when
faced with her own devastating diag-
nosis, committed herself to educating
others about this disease and the ben-
efit of screenings.
With so many Americans like Peg
and my mother-in-law diagnosed with
colorectal cancer each year, Congress
needs to support prevention efforts.
Over the last few years, funding for the
groundbreaking Colorectal Cancer Con-
trol Program has remained the same.
This year, I thank the Appropria-
tions Committee for recognizing this
problem. By bringing attention to the
increasing rate of colorectal cancer
among younger adults, we are sharing
the gift of research and promoting the
spread of 21st-century prevention.
My amendment would strengthen the
Appropriations Committee’s efforts by
providing $3 million in additional fund-
ing for colorectal cancer research
under the Coordinated Chronic Disease
Prevention and Health Promotion Pro-
gram.
In Virginia, the Virginia Department
of Health significantly benefits from
this program and uses these funds to
provide early screenings across the
Commonwealth.
If this critical amendment passes,
the House would provide a major in-
crease and much-needed funding for
colorectal cancer screening and control
under the CDC. This increased support
means more necessary screenings,
more evidence-based interventions, and
a path toward more lives saved, espe-
cially among some of our country’s
most vulnerable patients.
Studies indicate that as many as 60
percent of colorectal cancer deaths
could be prevented with screening, but
the number of colorectal cancer
screenings has remained level since
2010. Clearly, we are overdue for
progress in this fight.
By making a vigorous effort to in-
crease the numbers of screenings, we
will be able to catch abnormal growths
before they turn into cancer, and we
can catch colorectal cancer early when
treatment is more effective.
As we fight for additional vital fund-
ing for the CRCCP, we are allowing
prevention and education initiatives to
reach more Americans. That gives
more families the opportunity to live
cancer-free.
We have a rare opportunity to build a
coalition in this battle. Across the
country, more than 1,700 organizations
have committed to defeating colorectal
cancer as a public health crisis. To-
gether, they have committed to the
goal of 80 percent screened in the com-
ing years.
Congress needs to join this effort,
and my amendment can and should be
part of that fight.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Chair, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO).
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in support of this amendment.
I would note that the underlying bill
that we are considering today includes
a $2 million increase for a total funding
level of $45 million for colorectal can-
cer prevention activities at the CDC.
Given the increasing rate of colorectal
cancer among younger adults, I am
pleased to support further expansion of
CDC’s efforts.
As a survivor of ovarian cancer, I
thank the gentlewoman for raising the
issue of colorectal cancer and the im-
portance of cancer screenings.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment.
I know we will have a discussion
here, Madam Chair, about where the
dollars are coming from, but I would
like to remind the gentleman from
Maryland that, last evening, the mi-
nority voted overwhelmingly for a 14
percent cut across the board, which, in
fact, would have cut the general de-
partmental management by 14 percent,
so I find this line of opposition to be
somewhat disingenuous.
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Chair, I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, here we
go again. Obviously, we took a 5-hour
break, but now we are back to not
making priorities.
The bottom line is, now we are up to
$27 million out of this basket of money
that the Secretary has to manage a De-
partment that is actually increasing in
size and increasing in complexity.
This is a very worthy cause, and
there is no question in anyone’s mind,
I hope, that colon cancer screening, for
instance, is essential. Every American
who falls within the guidelines should
be encouraged to undergo the screen-
ing, but we have to set priorities.
If we are going to increase further
the funding into that program—be-
cause as we heard from the sub-
committee chair, we have already in-
creased the funding—if we are going to
increase it further, we have to look
somewhere to decrease funding. That is
not a magical pot of money that is end-
less. Literally, it is true that, sooner or
later, the Secretary is going to have to
take out loans to pay salaries in his
Department because we will have
drained the entire amount.
Again, since the last vote series,
which we had 1 a.m. eastern time—it is
now 9:20 eastern time—since then, we
have drained that fund by $27 million.
A lot of it transferred for good
projects, but that is not the way we
should be doing business here.
When families in my district have a
priority, they set a new priority. They
say this family needs this a lot right
now. They look into their budget and
ask what they are not going to spend
on. That is what we ought to be doing.
If this is so essential, Madam Chair,
I would suggest some other program,
not a magical pot of money that some
people believe has no bottom.
Again, the Secretary has to run an
increasingly complex Department. The
bottom line is that we have now
drained, if all the amendments pass

that we have discussed since 1 a.m., $27
million out of the fund. This is not the
way we ought to do business.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Chair, I
have trouble with that argument from
my colleague across the aisle when,
last night, he voted for a 14 percent cut
across the board to this pot of money,
which he refers to as a ‘‘magical’’ pot
of money.
I think it is incredibly important
that when we are looking at priorities,
priorities such as prevention, priorities
such as early detection related to such
a disease that kills so many Ameri-
cans, where prevention and early
screenings are vital to survival levels,
it is incredibly important that we
prioritize screenings and invest. This
amendment stipulates $3 million to-
ward this vital, vital effort.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, we are
showing the American people right now
that we live in fantasy land.
The bottom line is, the amendment
that I and many of my colleagues voted
for last night merely restores this bill
to the current state of law. It makes it
comply with the Budget Control Act. I
didn’t vote for the Budget Control Act,
but it is the law of the land.
We can pretend it is not. That is the
difference between us and the people in
my district. They don’t have Monopoly
money to play with. They can’t pre-
tend that the law isn’t the law. They
can’t pretend that they can invent
money in their families. They have to
follow the laws. They have to follow
their budgets. But I guess that is just
not true.
This is why Congress has a 9 percent
approval rating. The people watching
us today, the millions of people watch-
ing us—there are maybe several hun-
dred thousand watching us today—are
watching promises being made that
can’t be kept, promises being made
that take money out of not this gen-
eration but the next generation and
the generation following.
Again, this is a worthy cause. But
the bottom line is, last year, when the
majority was in the minority, every
single member in the Appropriations
Committee voted against funding this
program when it left the committee,
every single majority member when
they were in the minority.
I get how this game is being played.
I get it. We have to restore fiscal dis-
cipline, the same fiscal discipline every
family in our districts has. If you set a
priority and you decide this is nec-
essary to spend on, you find something
that is not necessary to spend on.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Chair, I
would like to note, for the RECORD,
that I am new to Congress, elected in
November, so I was not here last year
or last Congress during the tax bill
cycle. Given that my colleague across
the aisle was, I find the lectures about
fiscal discipline to be very challenging
to take when we are discussing Monop-
oly money, fantasy land money, and
taking money from the next genera-
tion.
I know a great deal about the chal-
lenges that ride on the fact that we
have increased our debt year after
year, and I find it very difficult to lis-
ten to lectures about this from a col-
league who, in fact, voted to balloon
the deficit.
This is about prevention and screen-
ing. This is about the health of Ameri-
cans. This is about being proactive in
our spending.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentlewoman has expired.
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, par-

The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
will state his parliamentary inquiry.
Mr. HARRIS. Is any time remaining
on the other side because the gentle-
woman moved to reserve her time?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland controls the only time
remaining.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I am a
physician. I have taken care of people
for 35 years. I am not sure I should be
lectured, Madam Chair, on the proper
way to take care of people in this coun-
try with regard to their health.
I understand the attraction of maybe
bringing a tax bill into this. I am not
sure why the proponents can’t leave
this as a discussion of funding health.
The bottom line is, this is an impor-
tant subject, no question about it.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Virginia (Ms.

The question was taken; and the Act-

The Chair recognizes the gentleman

Mr. DELGADO. Madam Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, upstate New York and
communities across the country are ex-
periencing an unprecedented increase
in Lyme disease and tick-borne dis-
eases. At all 14 of the townhalls that I
have held in my district this term,
folks asked me what Congress is doing
about Lyme disease.
Today, I am offering an amendment
to better understand and prevent this
disease. The amendment adds $1 mil-
lion in critical CDC funding for the pre-
vention, diagnosis, and treatment of
Lyme disease.
This package of appropriations bills
makes critical investments in our pri-
orities. But as temperatures rise and
families spend more time outside, we
must invest more in treating and pre-
venting Lyme.
Lyme disease is a devastating disease
that can often go undetected as it trav-
els through ticks, tiny bugs that reside
in dense forests and rural areas, areas
found all across my district in upstate
New York.
While most Lyme disease patients
who are diagnosed and treated early
can fully recover, 10 to 20 percent of pa-
tients suffer from persistent symp-
toms, which, for some, are chronic and
disabling.
These numbers are even more star-
tling as we consider that, over the last
25 years, Lyme disease has increased by
over 300 percent in the northeastern
States. In 2017, there were 3,502 con-
firmed cases of tick-borne Lyme in
New York State alone.
Madam Chair, I have 5-year-old twin
boys. Whenever I do bath time, I have
to check for ticks. There have been a
few scary moments where I have actu-
ally had to pull ticks off my little
boys. It is a frightening experience.
Parents, myself included, are sending
their children into their backyard or
local park with fears that they can re-
turn with a chronic lifelong and poten-
tially disabling disease.
b 0930
But this is just not a medical or
moral issue. Lyme disease is costing
our economy. How much money are the
American people spending on this dis-
ease as we still know so little about it?
Studies indicate that Lyme disease
costs approximately $1.3 billion each
year in direct medical costs alone in
the United States. The American peo-
ple are spending $1.3 billion on the
symptoms of a disease rather than in-
vesting in medical research to treat
and prevent it.
This figure doesn’t even address the
opportunity cost of failing to act to ad-
dress Lyme disease in our commu-
nities. How will our local economy at-
tract tourists when people can get
sick? What is the cost of keeping chil-
dren cooped up inside rather than en-
joying the outdoors for fear of tick-
borne illnesses?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4635
June 13, 2019
Upstate New Yorkers and commu-
nities struggling with tick populations
need medical solutions now to stop this
disease in its tracks. Prompt diagnosis
and treatment of tick-borne diseases
are crucial to prevent long-term com-
plications.
Today, available diagnostic tests can
be inaccurate and complex to interpret,
especially during the earliest stage of
infection when treatment is most effec-
tive. My amendment offers trying to
better understand the disease and al-
lowing for research to develop a more
effective treatment of the disease.
Unlike in other infectious disease
settings, tests to directly measure the
presence of the infecting organism are
not available for Lyme disease. This
leaves physicians without the tools
needed to diagnose; and without an ac-
curate diagnosis, it is challenging for
physicians to provide early treatment.
The disease requires specialized
treatments, which requires real invest-
ments in research to better manage
and prevent the disease. Madam Chair,
the time to invest is now. Indeed, the
National Science Foundation has de-
clared that Lyme disease is an emerg-
ing global pandemic due to climate
change.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I claim
the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. DELGADO. Madam Chair, I yield
1 minute to the gentlewoman from
Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO).
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentleman for yielding, and
I rise in support of his amendment.
I commend the gentleman’s efforts to
highlight Lyme disease, which, unfor-
tunately, has spread to many States
due to climate change. The geographic
area in which ticks can survive is in-
creasing as milder winters result in
fewer disease-carrying ticks dying dur-
ing the winter.
I am proud that our bill includes a $1
million increase, for a total funding
level of $13 million for the CDC to in-
tensify efforts to develop better
diagnostics and to bolster critical pre-
vention and surveillance networks.
This amendment would provide an ad-
ditional $1 million increase.
Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman
for offering this amendment, and I urge
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’
I might also add that, last evening,
the fiscal year 2020 House bill we spoke
about provides $193 million for the Sec-
retary of HHS’ administrative budget.
Yet, last night, Republicans, including
my colleague, voted to cut that budget
by 14 percent, which would have cut
the Secretary’s budget by $27 million.
So the argument that is being made
is a fantasy and really somewhat dis-
ingenuous.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from New York’s time is expired.
The gentleman from Maryland is rec-
ognized.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, what is
disingenuous is trying to make an ar-
gument that somehow this bill falls
within current statute.
The Budget Control Act is the con-
trolling statutory authority, and this
bill is 14 percent above the Budget Con-
trol Act.
Now, most people might think a
move to restore the congressional ac-
tion to lawfulness is actually a good
thing. In fact, maybe Americans
watching who have to live by a budget
in their households actually wonder
why we can’t do it here. They look at
a trillion-dollar deficit and they say:
Wait a minute. I can’t do that in my
household. Why does Congress do it to
the country?
The gentlewoman from Connecticut,
the gentleman from New York, they
share something in common with
Maryland: We are where Lyme disease
is endemic. No question about it, it is
a problem.
My problem is not with CDC dealing
with Lyme disease. With this amend-
ment, we are now up to $28 million
taken from the same source. This pre-
tend bottomless fund that all we have
to do is we can draw all we need out of
this fund is not the way budgeting
works. It is not the way budgeting
works in any family. It is not the way
budgeting should work here on Capitol
Hill.
And, again, I remind my colleagues,
people look at how Congress operates
in wonder—not awe, wonder. They fig-
ure: Why can’t Congress run the coun-
try like I have to run my household?
It is because we don’t choose prior-
ities here. We say this is important,
and it is, but we fail to do what all the
families in America do when they de-
cide something is more important.
They choose something that is less im-
portant and forgo spending money on
that.
So that is the deficit in this amend-
ment. This amendment is a worthy
cause. Lyme disease is a terrible dis-
ease, as the gentleman from New York
knows. We are not even sure how to di-
agnose it. Chronic Lyme disease is an
enigma to scientists and to medicine.
It should be a priority. But coupled
with that priority is finding something
else that is of lower priority and decid-
ing not to spend as much there and to
spend more here.
So that is why, reluctantly, I urge
the body, if they pass the other amend-
ments that we have chosen—that is,
considered since 1 a.m., the last time
we met—this would make $28 million
out of that mythical bottomless fund
that all these good ideas are funded
from.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. DELGADO).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.

ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from New York will be

The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Colorado.
Mr. CROW. Madam Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Madam Chair, I rise today to offer an
amendment supporting an additional $5
million appropriation for Project
SERV.
Project SERV and programs like it
provide mental health resources to stu-
dents and extend critical support in the
wake of tragedies, such as school
shootings like the one that took place
at STEM School in my district.
By increasing funding, we can in-
crease our ability to address the men-
tal health among our precious popu-
lation: our children.
The underlying bill doubles the
amount of funding for Project SERV to
$10 million. Moreover, additional fund-
ing was provided in the disaster supple-
mental that I was proud to vote for in
May.
I thank the chairman, ranking mem-
ber, and the members of the committee
for their hard work to ensure that this
program is properly funded.
With my amendment, I hope that we
can continue to scale Project SERV
and mental health programs like it so
that we can ensure that every student
gets the help that they deserve.
In the time since the STEM School
shooting in my district, I have had the
privilege to meet with several students
and their families. Their courage and
thoughtfulness is unparalleled.
We discussed and reflected on ways
that we in this body can help students,
in a bipartisan manner, to cope with
crisis: What can we do? How do we re-
start the learning process? How do we
prevent future tragedies?
The common denominators were ex-
panding mental health curriculum in
schools; grief counseling; helping stu-
dents, teachers, administrators, and
their families recover. It was some-
thing that we came together and found

some bipartisan consensus on in the
discussions that I have had.
Experts can attest shootings and
other school tragedies take a terrible
toll on our students, causing sleep dis-
orders, anxiety, and even PTS. We need
programs like Project SERV. We need
to ensure that our children have access
to mental health services they need in
order to recover, in order to focus on
their studies, in order to make sure
tragedies like this never happen again.
And we need to scale this program and
those like it to make sure that this
happens at a much larger and national
scale.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support my amendment, and I yield
as much time as she may consume to
the gentlewoman from Connecticut
(Ms. DELAURO).
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentleman for yielding, and
I rise in support of this amendment and
the Project School Emergency Re-
sponse to Violence, Project SERV, pro-
gram.
The program provides counseling and
referral to mental health services, as
well as other education-related serv-
ices, to school districts, colleges, and
universities in which the learning envi-
ronment has been disrupted by a vio-
lent or traumatic crisis.
To strengthen this critical program,
the underlying bill increases the set-
aside within the School Safety Na-
tional Activities program by $5 million
over the 2019 enacted level.
I appreciate that the amendment is
drawing attention to this important
program, and I am happy to support it.
Mr. CROW. Madam Chair, I am pre-
pared to close, and I yield myself the
balance of my time.
Madam Chair, we have an obligation
to take care of our students, teachers,
and school administrators after hor-
rific tragedies. We must ensure that
they can grieve, heal, return to school,
and focus on learning and moving for-
ward with their lives, all the while feel-
ing safe doing so.
I look forward to working with the
distinguished chairwoman, appropri-
ators, and members of the authorizing
committee to support Project SERV
and programs like it in the months and
years ahead.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

AMENDMENT NO. 77 OFFERED BY MS. HOULAHAN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 77 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Chair, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 117, line 8, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(increased by $1,000,000) (reduced by
$1,000,000)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentlewoman
from Pennsylvania (Ms. HOULAHAN) and
a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania.
Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Chair, I rise
today in support of my amendment to
H.R. 2740, which advocates for funding
for the Department of Education’s
comprehensive literacy development
grants.
The LEARN Program provides com-
petitive grants to States to help local
educational agencies develop com-
prehensive literacy plans to ensure
high-quality instruction and evidence-
based intervention strategies for all
students from birth through grade 12.
This program is the only Federal
funding stream to support these state-
wide efforts. This funding allows local
school districts to support high-quality
professional development for teachers,
teacher leaders, principals, and special-
ized instructional support personnel to
improve literacy instruction for strug-
gling readers and writers, including
English language learners and students
with disabilities.
The state of literacy in our country
is alarming. Before coming to Con-
gress, I taught high school chemistry,
and what I found was that most of my
high school students couldn’t read
above a third or fourth grade level.
How could my students learn chem-
istry if they couldn’t read? How could
they expect to, later in life, be able to
pursue a quality and rewarding life?
It was a wake-up call for me, and I
spent the next 4 years, as a con-
sequence, building a nonprofit that fo-
cused on early childhood literacy in
our most disadvantaged communities.
According to the National Institute
of Literacy, approximately 32 million
adults in the U.S. cannot read. The Or-
ganization for Economic Cooperation
and Development found that half of
U.S. adults cannot read a book written
at an eighth grade level.
The fight for a more literate America
is crucial, and we must acknowledge
that low literacy more dramatically af-
fects communities of color.
On the most recent National Assess-
ment of Educational Progress, in the
12th grade reading level assessments, 46
percent of White students scored at or
above proficient, while only 25 percent
of Latino and 17 percent of Black stu-
dents scored proficient. In essence, the
fight for literacy is a fight for a fairer
country, for a more level playing field.
How can we expect young Americans
from every race, gender, and socio-
economic background to be ready for
our workforce?
b 0945
How can we be living up to the no-
tion that every American deserves a
shot at the American Dream if we are
not aggressively fighting to ensure
that they have the most fundamental
ability to read.
Our inaction is costing us all. The
National Council for Adult Learning
estimates that low literacy costs our
country $225 billion each year in non-
productivity in the workforce, crime,
and loss of tax revenue due to unem-
ployment.
The American Journal of Public
Health found that in excess of $230 bil-
lion a year in healthcare costs is linked
to low adult literacy. Our inaction on
literacy is costing us nearly $500 billion
a year. I believe, and I am sure that
many of my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle believe, that every American
child deserves his or her shot at the
American Dream, at the ability to get
a quality education, and to make a liv-
ing wage to support themselves and
their families.
We are denying millions of people
their shot and their promise in this
country by refusing to more aggres-
sively advocate for and fund programs
that do the critical work of increasing
our literacy levels.
I am thankful that my amendment is
being considered. I think it is an im-
portant first step in the long overdue
fight for a more literate and, by exten-
sion, a more fair America. I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chairwoman, I
rise in opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Chair, I
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO).
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chairwoman,
I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
I rise in support of this amendment
and of Comprehensive Literacy Devel-
opment grants, which help States and
school districts provide evidence-based
literacy instruction for disadvantaged
students from birth through grade 12.
Literacy is a mark of a civilized soci-
ety, and it is one of the most impor-
tant predictors of a student’s success.
To further advance literacy skills for
students across the country, the under-
lying bill provides $195 million for
Comprehensive Literacy Development
grants, a $5 million increase over the
fiscal year 2019 enacted level.
I might add that the Trump adminis-
tration cut this program, literacy, and
they also cut the innovative ap-
proaches to literacy, again, which we
have increased by $2 million. It may
mean that they don’t understand that
literacy is a mark of a civilized soci-
ety. I appreciate that the amendment
is drawing attention to the importance
of this program, and I am happy to sup-
port it.

law. I know that for Congress here, we
don’t really like to follow the law. We
think we make it for everybody else,
and we don’t have to follow it. In fact,
the bill we are discussing today doesn’t
follow the Budget Control Act. It pre-
tends that the law doesn’t exist.
Now, the Trump administration did
the appropriate thing and said: You
know what? The law does exist. The
reason why we get into trouble, and
why America looks at what Congress
does, the profligate spending that we
have, the trillion-dollar deficits, and
the $22 trillion debt is because in some
cases like this, we just don’t follow the
law. The President says: No, we should
return to the law.
If the Congress thinks we ought to
spend more, then pass a bill that
changes the Budget Control Act. But,
Madam Chairwoman, I would suggest
that if the President had not followed
the law, the complaint would be: The
President is not following the law. You
are damned if you do. You are damned
if you don’t.
The President follows the Budget
Control Act, submits a budget con-
sistent with that, and then gets blamed
by the majority for following the law,
not playing make-believe budgets.
Madam Chairwoman, our families
can’t do make-believe budgets. They
have a certain amount of money and
they have to stay within that budget.
But I guess we are Congress. We are
different. We can make believe.
This is why we have a 9 percent ap-
proval rating, because Americans look
at what we do here in Congress and
say: This isn’t the real world.
This education is important. There is
no question about it, but we have to
place priorities. I reluctantly oppose
the amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Chair-
woman, I am nearly speechless with
the conversation that I have just heard
where we are talking about the most
fundamental of things that we need,
the equipment that we need to be func-
tioning in our society, that skill of lit-
eracy, that we are thinking somehow
that this is a checkbook balance situa-
tion rather than an investment in a
child, an investment in a family, an in-
vestment in a future.
If we are talking about the need to
imagine, we have to give people the
skills so that they may imagine. Imag-
ine the life that they will be able to
have when they are able to read a
street sign; when they are able to read
to their child; when they are able to
read their driver’s test. These are
things that we should not deny anyone.
These are fundamental things that we
absolutely have to provide to every sin-
gle citizen in our economy.
If we are not providing education and
literacy, what good is this Nation? I
will conclude by saying that I came
here to Congress and I stand on this
floor, the daughter of a refugee from
Poland. He came here with nothing as
a 5 year old. He came here with no lit-
eracy skills, and a generation later, I
am standing here in front of you be-
cause my father had the opportunity to
learn to read.
My father had the opportunity to
pursue the American Dream, and 70
years later, I stand here in front of you
because that is the promise that our
Nation makes to all of us and the in-
vestment that our Nation makes in
every one of us.
I very much appreciate the oppor-
tunity to speak about something that I
am deeply passionate about. I am con-
fident that the vast majority of our
Nation is deeply passionate about this,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chairwoman,
may I inquire how much time I have
remaining?
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Maryland has 3 minutes remain-
ing.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chairwoman, I
won’t take 3 minutes. We obviously
have a lot of work to do this morning
and did a lot of work last night.
Part of the American Dream—and
my parents as well came to this coun-
try—and it is amazing that the chil-
dren of immigrants can sit on this
floor, but they came to this country
because there is a rule of law in this
country.
The law right now says, under the
Budget Control Act, that we should be
spending much less than this bill sug-
gests overall. The Trump administra-
tion proposed spending within the law.
Now, that law is not a Trump adminis-
tration law. That law was actually
signed by the last President with the
majority controlling the Senate. It was
a bipartisan agreement, the Budget
Control Act.
But again, we pretend that it just
doesn’t exist. This is part of the prob-
lem. Americans look at us and say:
Wait a minute. You expect us to live by
the law? In fact, you insist that we live
by the law, and now talk about imagi-
nation, this is really imaginary be-
cause we are presenting a proposal here
today that spends tens and tens of bil-
lions of dollars more than the law says
we are authorized to spend. That is as-
tounding.
No wonder we have a 9 percent ap-
proval rating. I yield back the balance
of my time.

H4638 June 13, 2019
At the end of division A (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll. None of the funds made available
by this Act may be used to convene an ethics
advisory board authorized under section 492A
of the Public Health Service Act with regard
to research grant applications or current re-
search projects in the competitive renewal
process that propose to use human fetal tis-
sue.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 436, the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. POCAN) and a Member op-
posed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Wisconsin.
Mr. POCAN. Madam Chairwoman, I
rise today to offer an amendment that
ensures the Trump administration can-
not block critical groundbreaking re-
search solely because it utilizes human
fetal tissue.
I believe this new policy announced
by HHS just last week is shortsighted
and that Congress should make its
voice heard on the issue. This amend-
ment prohibits any funds in the bill
being used to establish a sham ethics
advisory board with regard to research
products that use human fetal tissue.
The June 5, HHS announcement bars
NIH scientists from conducting any re-
search using fetal tissue unless an ad-
ditional ethics advisory board review of
NIH grant applications for fetal tissue
research occurs. This decision by Presi-
dent Trump is unnecessary since these
grant applications are already subject
to rigorous ethical review require-
ments.
Currently, any federally funded re-
search that uses fetal tissue must com-
ply with oversight pursuant to the NIH
Revitalization Act of 1993, which was
enacted on a bipartisan basis. This
framework requires informed consent
and declarations pertaining to fetal tis-

Let’s be clear. The Trump adminis-
tration’s decision is not about science
or ethics. It is about politics.
Fetal tissue research is not new. It
has been supported by the NIH since
the 1950s, and fetal tissue has been used
to develop vaccines that have saved
and improved the lives of billions of
people around the world.
Vaccines for diseases such as mea-
sles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox,
whooping cough, tetanus, hepatitis A,
and rabies were all created using fetal
cell cultures. Researchers today are
using fetal cells to develop vaccines
against diseases that include Ebola,
HIV, and dengue fever. Studies at UW-
Madison in my district involving fetal
tissue are trying to develop treatments
for conditions that include blindness,
Zika, developmental disorders, and dia-
betes.
This is exactly the type of research
that the Federal Government should be
supporting, not defunding.
I encourage my colleagues to ensure
that we all continue to fund critical re-
search on behalf of the American peo-
ple and that we block last week’s deci-
sion that threatens Federal funding of
fetal tissue research.
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms.
DELAURO), who is an amazing col-
league.
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise
in strong support of Congressman
POCAN’s amendment.
The administration’s decision to
forgo promising research to develop
treatments and cures for diseases such
as HIV, ALS, and Parkinson’s, once
again, is putting extreme personal ide-
ology ahead of public health.
Researchers have used fetal tissue in
research for decades to develop vac-
cines and cures for diseases such as
polio and measles. The research has
saved millions of lives. That is what we
are about, saving lives.
Research involving fetal tissue today
is conducted subject to strict guide-
lines that have lasted through both
Democratic and Republican adminis-
trations. This antiscience decision will
stall medical research in its tracks, re-
duce hope for those suffering from de-
bilitating diseases, and harm the abil-
ity of American scientists to continue
to lead global efforts on biomedical re-
search.
The Trump administration has said
that the Department of Health and
Human Services conducted an audit
and scientific review of fetal tissue re-
search that led to this decision. Quite
frankly, they refuse to make the re-
sults of that review available to the
Congress.
There is simply no scientific or eth-
ical basis for the proposed restrictions
on this vital research. It is misguided.
It is a dangerous policy. It should be
reversed.
Madam Chair, I support the gentle-
man’s amendment.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
Maryland is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, let’s get
a handle on exactly what this amend-
ment does. This amendment says that
we are going to take one of the most
controversial areas of research—con-
troversial regarding the ethics of the
research—and we are going to say the
Federal Government can’t determine
whether it is ethical.
Madam Chair, we have a construct
for this. This construct was developed
by Mr. Waxman two decades ago in a
piece of statute signed by President
Clinton that said that when you submit
research for funding to the HHS De-
partment, and it is a topic around
which there are ethical questions—and
there are ethical questions—that the
Secretary can choose to seat a panel,
not a sham panel, but a panel that con-
sists of attorneys, ethicists, practicing
physicians, theologians, and scientists
with substantial accomplishments in
biomedical and behavioral research.
That doesn’t sound too sham to me.
It is a panel that is going to review it
because, Madam Chair, without that,
the only review this gets with regard
to, for instance, an institutional review
board is at the institution that stands
to gain the funding when the project is
funded. It is because of that conflict of
interest that the Congress thoughtfully
said, in statute, that we ought to have
a mechanism to consider the ethics.
Madam Chair, we are going to hear
about all kinds of things done with
fetal tissue. Yes, they were done dec-
ades and decades ago. Those vaccines
were done on cell lines that have been
around for a long time.
Can there be some research that
might benefit from fetal tissue? Sure,
there can be. But we should always
make the determination of whether it
is ethical.
How can we stand in good conscience
and say that we are going to take, on
the basis of ethics, one of the most con-
troversial areas of research and wall it
off and say that the Federal Govern-
ment can’t consider ethics? Oh, my
gosh, that is a step way too far.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. POCAN. Madam Chair, may I in-
quire how much time I have remaining.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
Wisconsin has 11⁄2 minutes remaining.
Mr. POCAN. Apparently, Madam
Chair, the other side of the aisle would
like to debate political science rather
than medical science today. I under-
stand that. It is always great to make
your base happy rather than healthy.
But there is a big difference when it
comes to the issue of fetal tissue.
We have had this debate before in
committee. This isn’t new. What is new
are the cures that are coming out of
the use of fetal tissue not just at UW-
Madison but across the country.
The President’s action shows how far
removed not just the debate is that we
just heard, which is more about poli-
tics than science, but over half the peo-
ple who are on this new board don’t
even have to be scientists, when we al-
ready have the proper oversight in
place to make sure that this is ethical
research.
I get it. You have to make your base
happy, especially in the era of Donald
Trump. But the bottom line is, you are
hurting your constituents by trying to
place politics over medical science.
That is just a really bad idea.
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY
Mr. HARRIS. Parliamentary inquiry.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
Maryland will state his parliamentary
inquiry.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, are com-
ments supposed to be addressed to the
Chair?
The CHAIR. Members are reminded
to direct their remarks to the Chair.
Mr. POCAN. Which I was doing,
Madam Chair, and I appreciate that.
So, again, if you want to be a sci-
entist who doesn’t believe in science,
that is fine. That means you are a poli-
tician. I would like to think that those
of us who are going to deal with those

areas that involve science, even if we
are politicians, focus on the science as-
pects, and I am going to do just that.
That is why this amendment is impor-
tant to make sure we have lifesaving
research.
Madam Chair, I urge support, and I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, may I in-
quire as to how much time remains.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
Maryland has 2 1⁄2 minutes remaining.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, before I
came to Congress, I was a medical sci-
entist. I actually held NIH grants. So,
Madam Chair, I find it a little unusual
that someone would criticize my opin-
ion on medical science and dismiss it.
But we live in a strange world. That is
why the American people look at Con-
gress and wonder what is going on.
The fact of the matter is that it is
not a Trump administration policy
that issues where ethics are involved
should go to a committee convened to
consider that.
Madam Chair, I have had things go
before IRBs, institutional review
boards, at institutions. It is a good
first step, and the peer-review process
at NIH is probably a good second step.
But for some issues like fetal tissue re-
search, where we saw fetal tissue mar-
keted—brains, $800 plus tax—we think
it is not at all unreasonable that the
Federal Government, before spending a
dime of taxpayer money—because, re-
member, the President’s policy does
nothing about funding it. It just says
taxpayer dollars shouldn’t be used un-
less we have considered the ethics.
My gosh, there is nothing wrong with
that. The fact of the matter is that
Americans don’t want their tax dollars
spent on things that are unethical, and
this is the way that we can determine
whether it is ethical.
Again, this has not been set up by the
Trump administration. This is Mr.
Waxman, who will never be confused
with a Republican, and signed by Presi-
dent Clinton.
I will remind the gentleman that this
issue has been discussed in committee
for a few years. The committee has
come down on both sides of it because
this is a controversial issue, and con-
troversial issues are best left to the ex-
perts just like this ethics committee
statute states.
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The CHAIR. The question is on the
amendment offered by the gentleman
from Wisconsin (Mr. POCAN).
The question was taken; and the
Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Chair, I

The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of
rule XVIII, further proceedings on the

from Wisconsin will be postponed.

amount made available under this heading
and not reserved by the preceding provisos,
$10,000,000 shall be made available to carry
out section 7091 of the SUPPORT for Pa-
tients and Communities Act (Public Law 115-

The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 436, the gentleman from New

Mr. PASCRELL. First, Madam Chair,
I commend Chairwoman DELAURO, the
gentlewoman from Connecticut, and
Ranking Member COLE for their work
on this bill and accommodating a bi-
partisan amendment. I thank my col-
leagues, Congressman DAVID MCKIN-
LEY, Congresswoman DIANA DEGETTE,
and Congressman SCOTT TIPTON, for
working together with me on this
quest for the past 2 years.
The Alternatives to Opioids in the
Emergency Department program, or
ALTO, was first piloted by Dr. Mark
Rosenberg, a doctor at St. Joseph’s
emergency department in my home-
town of Paterson—one T—New Jersey,
and hospitals in Colorado as well.
ALTO tests alternative pain manage-
ment protocols to limit the use of
opioids in emergency departments.
ALTO programs can serve as a new
preventive blueprint for hospitals and
healthcare providers across America.
As our health providers grapple with
ways to combat the opioid epidemic
wracking every community in our Na-
tion, they have been working and
achieving results to prevent unneces-
sary use of opioids.
To build on these successful pro-
grams, we introduced H.R. 5197, the Al-
ternatives to Opioids in the Emergency
Department Act, last Congress. To help
tackle the opioid crisis and limit the
use of opioids in emergency depart-
ments, this bill authorized a $10 mil-
lion grant program to fund demonstra-
tion programs to test alternative pain
management protocols. Thanks to the
Energy and Commerce Committee, our
bill was signed into law as part of H.R.
6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Com-
munities Act.
This bipartisan Pascrell-McKinley-
DeGette-Tipton amendment No. 2
would provide the full authorized fund-
ing for the Alternatives to Opioids pro-
gram. Our amendment has the support
of the American College of Emergency
Physicians.
Madam Chair, I include in the
RECORD their letter.
AMERICAN COLLEGE OF
EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS,
June 11, 2019.
Hon. BILL PASCRELL, Jr.,
Washington, DC.
DEAR CONGRESSMAN PASCRELL: On behalf of
the American College of Emergency Physi-
cians (ACEP) and our 38,000 members, thank
you for your steadfast commitment to ad-
dress the nation’s opioid epidemic, especially
your continued efforts to promote your Al-
ternatives to Opioids (ALTO) in the Emer-
gency Department Act that was successfully
included in the SUPPORT for Patients and
Communities Act (P.L. 115–271) last year.
ACEP was proud to work with you to secure
enactment of this important law that will
help expand access to appropriate options to
treat a patient’s pain without opioids.
ALTO is based on a very simple premise
that the best way to avoid opioid misuse and
addiction is to never start a patient on
opioids. ALTO protocols use specific non-
addicting drugs and therapies that target re-
ceptor sites and enzymes that mediate the
pain. As you well know, within two years of
implementing the ALTO program at a hos-
pital in New Jersey, there was an 82 percent
reduction in opioid prescriptions. More re-
cently, 10 hospitals in Colorado established a
similar program and saw a decrease in opioid
use of 36 percent in just the first six months.
ACEP was deeply grateful for your efforts
last year to secure this program’s authoriza-
tion as part of the SUPPORT Act, and we
continue to support your efforts to secure
appropriated funding for this critical pro-
gram. Thank you again for your leadership
on this issue, and please know that ACEP
stands ready to assist you in this effort.
Sincerely,
VIDOR E. FRIEDMAN, MD, FACEP,
ACEP President.
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Chair, let’s
give our ERs the resources to help save
some more lives. I respectfully ask the
House to support my amendment so
that we may fully fund the ALTO pro-
gram.
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, even
though I don’t oppose the amendment,
I rise in opposition.
The CHAIR. Without objection, the
gentleman from Maryland is recog-
nized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I reserve

Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Chair, I
yield such time as she may consume to
the distinguished gentlewoman from
Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO).
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I
thank the gentleman from Paterson
with one T.
Madam Chair, I rise in support of this
bipartisan amendment, and let me reit-
erate ‘‘bipartisan amendment.’’
This amendment provides $10 million
for a new program at the Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad-
ministration for a newly authorized
demonstration program for hospitals
and emergency departments to de-
velop, implement, or study alternatives
to opioids for pain management.
As our Nation continues to combat
the opioid epidemic, this effort would
provide the opportunity to study and
develop best practice pain management
strategies that involve nonaddictive
medical products and other types of
treatments provided in our emergency
rooms.
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues
to support this bipartisan amendment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4640 June 13, 2019
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Chair, I thank
the gentleman from New Jersey for
this. This is a real problem that we
have. As a physician, I will tell you, we
haven’t gotten this right yet.
Again, I am an anesthesiologist, and
I have been taking care of patients for
30 years, three decades. What we still
find is that we have people who pre-
scribe narcotics and opioids.
We know, by the way, Madam Chair,
that if someone is given a 10-day sup-
ply of opioids for an outpatient oper-
ation, there is a 10 percent chance that
they will be addicted 1 year afterward.
Yesterday, my son had an outpatient
operation, and he got a prescription for
50 opioid pills. I am sitting there think-
ing, oh my God, is there an alter-
native?
We were taught for years that if you
go to the emergency room and you
have a broken bone, you are going to
get sent out with a narcotic prescrip-
tion. Then they did a study that shows
that alternating Tylenol with
ibuprofen, acetaminophen with
ibuprofen, is just as good as the nar-
cotic.
b 1015
My God, for decades, we have been
giving people narcotics, unaware that
we were committing a certain number
of them to a terrible life.
And I appreciate the gentleman’s
passion about it, because we had good
news in Maryland yesterday, for the
first time, the number of deaths from
overdoses went down. But the number
of overdoses continues to increase.
We got better at preventing the
deaths. Now we have to get better at
preventing the addiction and treating
the addiction.
Madam Chair, this amendment goes a
long way toward that.
I reserve the balance of my time
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Chair, I
thank my colleagues for the support. I

The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 593, line 22, strike ‘‘That’’ and all
that follows through ‘‘Provided further,’’ on

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentlewoman
from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Arizona.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Chair, my
amendment would strike the require-
ment that at least $750 million of Glob-
al Health Programs shall be made
available for so-called family planning,
a funding stream that can support do-
mestically-based, nongovernment orga-
nizations that support the global abor-
tion industry.
Regard for human life has never been
higher. Polling statistics indicate that
Americans are as likely to identify as
pro-life as they are pro-choice.
A Marist Poll shows that 75 percent
of Americans would limit abortion to
the first 3 months of pregnancy.
Further, Americans oppose taxpayer
funding for abortion in the U.S., 54 per-
cent to 39 percent.
Madam Chair, 75 percent of Ameri-
cans oppose using tax dollars to fund
abortions in foreign countries. That is
75 percent.
Our policies reflect these views
through the Hyde amendment, which
has protected Federal tax dollars from
funding abortions in the United States
for the last four decades, and the
Helms amendment, passed in 1973, to
protect tax dollars from being spent on
abortions through U.S. foreign assist-
ance.
Most recently, President Trump has
committed to Congress and to the
American people that he will veto any
legislation that encourages the de-
struction of innocent human life at any
stage.
Our President has also courageously
reinstated the Protecting Life in Glob-
al Health Assistance policy, which pro-
hibits foreign nongovernment organiza-
tions from performing and promoting
abortion as long as they are receiving
U.S. tax dollars.
However, domestic nongovernment
organizations are still using Federal
tax dollars to perform and promote
abortion abroad.
In the State and Foreign Operations
appropriations language, we use the
word ‘‘family planning’’ and ‘‘reproduc-
tive health’’ to disguise giving grant
recipients license to permeate foreign
countries with abortion.
Promoting abortion in poor, devel-
oping nations undermines our purposes
in providing lifesaving assistance and, I
believe, disrespects the cultures and,
sometimes, the policies of those na-
tions.
It encourages the idea that having
fewer children reduces poverty and eco-
nomic instability instead of promoting
real solutions to those problems, like
more human rights and liberties and
helping women be self-employed.
Stopping domestic nongovernment
organizations from using American tax
dollars for abortions is consistent with
our other policies, like the Hyde and
Helms amendments, and the PLGHA
that limits government funding for
abortions, and is consistent with the
views of 75 percent of Americans.
These policies save lives. In the case
of my amendment, thousands of chil-
dren all over the world can be saved.
To be clear, my amendment does not
eliminate, nor does it reduce, funding.
My amendment aims to ensure that,
instead of investing funds in promoting
and performing abortions abroad, the
valuable dollars that fund our global
health programs are vested in reducing
maternal and infant mortality, treat-
ing birth complications and enabling
access to safe blood, nutrition, and
antibiotics.
These dollars should be used to pro-
vide quality obstetric care and true hu-
manitarian assistance to those in need.

June 13, 2019
My amendment ensures that our Na-
tion’s policies align with the views of
the vast majority of the American peo-
ple. We must not allow this onslaught
on children to continue being promoted
in foreign nations, and especially not
with our tax dollars.
Children are a source of hope, pros-
perity, and development. They must be
treated as such from the very begin-
ning of their lives, here and every-
where.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I claim
the time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. PASCRELL).
The gentlewoman from New York is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I am
shocked that my colleague would pro-
pose an amendment that would strike
all funding for bilateral family plan-
ning.
These services prevent unintended
pregnancies, maternal deaths, and
abortions; reduce rates of infant and
child mortality; empower women to
stay in school and join the workforce;
create stronger and healthier families;
and improve economies.
Aren’t these bipartisan policy out-
comes that both sides of the aisle
should be supporting?
Family planning does exactly what it
says: It helps women plan when to have
a family.
But, as we sit here today, more than
200 million women around the world
still lack access to modern contracep-
tives.
If we want to build the self-reliance
of countries, one of the most cost-effec-
tive measures is to increase access to
the family planning services that
women so desperately seek. Mr. Chair,
I ask my colleagues to oppose this
amendment.
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. LEE), a member of
the State, Foreign Operations, and Re-
lated Programs Subcommittee.
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chair, I
thank Madam Chair for her leadership
and for yielding time.
I rise in strong opposition to this
amendment, which would strike the
provision in the bill that increases
funding for international family plan-
ning and reproductive health programs.
Women around the world deserve ac-
cess to the full range of reproductive
healthcare, and the Fiscal Year 2020
State and Foreign Operations bill will
help to ensure that.
USAID provides vitally needed fam-
ily planning funds to overseas health
centers. Evidence has shown that
USAID family planning programs have
had important, real-world effects on
the health of women and families
worldwide, resulting in fewer unin-
tended births, abortions, and mis-
carriages.
Funding for our international family
planning programs has also helped re-
duce maternal and infant deaths, a
goal that has strong bipartisan sup-
port.
Mr. Chair, I have been around the
world, to Africa and to other countries
and continents, and have talked with
families in villages, women and their
spouses with maybe five, six, seven
children.
I have visited these villages with Re-
publicans. And their first request to us
is to help them with family planning.
They know that it is so important in
terms of planning the births of their
children and in terms of just the sta-
bility of the family and the empower-
ment of women that family planning
services be available.
Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment,
and I urge my colleagues to oppose the
amendment.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, cutting
funds to bilateral family planning pro-
grams is simply bad foreign policy. It
undermines U.S. Agency for Inter-
national Development objectives and
hurts millions of women and girls.
I strongly urge my colleagues to op-
pose this amendment, and I yield back
the balance of my time.

are young girls and women who are fac-
ing this kind of brutal attack. My
amendment, which makes a good bill
even better, provides $1 million more
to help combat the draconian practice
of female genital mutilation, cutting,
FGM/C, abroad.
Female genital mutilation comprises
all procedures that involve partial or
total removal of the external female
genitalia or other injury to the female
genital organs for nonmedical pur-
poses.
This practice is rooted in gender in-
equality and is often linked to other
elements of gender-based violence and
discrimination, such as child marriage,
recognized internationally as a viola-
tion of the human rights of women and
girls.
Unfortunately, this means an esti-
mated 200 million girls and women
alive today have been victims already
of FGM/C, female genital mutilation,
with girls 14 and younger representing
44 million of those who have been cut.
For example, around the world, at
least five girls are mutilated, cut. More
than 3 million girls are estimated to be
at risk.
The impacts of this on the physical
health of women and girls can include
bleeding, infection, obstetric fistula,
complications during childbirth, and
death.
I ask my colleagues to think about
their children, their girls.
According to UNICEF, FGM/C is re-
ported to occur in all parts of the
world, but is most prevalent in parts of
Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.
So I ask my colleagues to support
this legislation.
I wish to thank Chairman MCGOVERN and
Ranking Member COLE of the Rules Com-
mittee for making this Jackson Lee Amend-
ment in order.
I thank Chairwoman LOWEY and Ranking
Member ROGERS for their hard work in bring-
ing Division D, the State, Foreign Operations,
and Related Programs portion of this omnibus
appropriations legislative package, to the floor.
I thank them all for this opportunity to ex-
plain the Jackson Lee Amendment, which
makes a good bill even better by providing $1
million more to help combat the draconian
practice of Female Genital Mutilation/cutting
(FGM/C) abroad.
I have been a dedicated champion against
this practice for a long while, even working
with former Congressman Joe Crowley of New
York to introduce legislation targeted at sup-
porting the elimination of this ludicrous prac-
tice of mutilating young women.
Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C)
comprises all procedures that involve partial or
total removal of the external female genitalia,
or other injury to the female genital organs for
non-medical reasons.
This practice is rooted in gender inequality
and is often linked to other elements of gen-
der-based violence and discrimination, such
as child marriage and recognized internation-
ally as a violation of the human rights of
women and girls.
Unfortunately, this means an estimated 200
million girls and women alive today have been
victims of FGM/C, with girls 14 and younger
representing 44 million of those who have
been cut.

For example, consider that:
1. Around the world, at least five girls are
mutilated/cut every hour.
2. More than 3 million girls are estimated to
be at risk of FGM/C annually.
3. The impacts of FGM/C on the physical
health of women and girls can include bleed-
ing, infection, obstetric fistula, complications
during childbirth and death.
Other significant barriers to combatting the
practice of FGM/C include the high concentra-
tion in specific regions associated with several
cultural traditions, that is not tied to any one
religion.
According to UNICEF, FGM/C is reported to
occur in all parts of the world, but is most
prevalent in parts of Africa, the Middle East,
and Asia.
Due to the commonality of this practice
many migrants to the U.S. bring the practice
of FGM/C with them, increasing the impor-
tance of combatting FGM/C abroad.
The United Nations adopted a set of 17
Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 that
includes a target to eliminate FGM/C and rec-
ognizing the abandonment of this harmful
practice can be achieved because of a com-
prehensive movement that involves all public
and private stakeholders in society.
With these provisions in place and my
amendment increasing the funding for foreign
assistance we can ensure Female Genital Mu-
tilation/Cutting (FGM/C), an internationally rec-
ognized violation of the human rights of girls
and women comes to an end.
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) pub-
lished a report in 2016 estimating that 513,000
women and girls in the United States were at
risk or may have been subjected to FGM/C.
The presence of FGM/C in the United
States brings a sobering truth to light, that we
still have much work to do here at home to
stop our young women and girls from suffering
at the hands of this archaic and utterly unnec-
essary practice.
I am reminded of the story of Hadiatu
Jalloh, a 7-year-old from Sierra Leone, who
with her mother fled to Houston to seek a life
saving operation to rectify complications from
the practice of FGM/C from which she suf-
fered for more than a year.
Due to complications from the FGM proce-
dure, little Hadiatu could not stop bleeding,
she then underwent two additional non-med-
ical procedures to repair the damage she suf-
fered.
However, the bleeding continued and after
the second procedure to stop the bleeding,
Hadiatu could not properly urinate and suf-
fered terrible pain.
In her desperate quest for help, Hadiatu’s
mother Umu took her daughter across the bor-
der to Sierra Leone, but still could not find a
doctor to treat Hadiatu.
Dr. Hardwick-Smith a world-renowned board
certified OBGYN—along with a team led by
Houston pediatric urologist Dr. Eric Jones—
solved Hadiatu’s problem by removing scar
tissue during the successful surgery.
Stories such like this remind me of the im-
portance of this work, and how can we cannot
afford to ignore any instance of FGM/C.
And that is why earlier we celebrated the
International Day of Zero Tolerance for Fe-
male Genital Mutilation, a multinational effort
to bring this practice to an end.
That is why my amendment reprograms
funding that will be used by the U.S. Agency
for International Development (USAID) for
elimination of FGM/C.
It also directs the U.S. Department of State
to emphasize the need to raise awareness
among communities at the grassroots level,
through diplomatic and multilateral engage-
ment and within humanitarian settings to ad-
dress the practice of FGM/C.
In short, the Jackson Lee Amendment in-
creases funding to protect young women and
girls from mutilation at the most intimate level.
The amount of funds dedicated to these
programs reflects the commitment by the inter-
national community to the goals of protecting
women and girls and truly addressing this
problem.
The harmful practice of female genital muti-
lation undermines the human rights of women
and girls by damaging their health, limiting
their economic opportunities and girls’ access
to education, and increases the likelihood of
early and forced marriage.
The Jackson Lee Amendment increases
funding to expedite the complete and total
elimination of FGM/C.
I urge support for the Jackson Lee Amend-
ment.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I claim
time in opposition, although I am not
opposed to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentlewoman from New York
is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, while this
amendment does not have a budgetary
effect, I would like to thank my col-
league for raising such an important
issue for millions of women around the
world.
For more than 200 million women, fe-
male genital mutilation can mean
health problems that haunt them for
the rest of their lives. The quest for
gender equality will not be complete
until women are no longer subjected to
these practices.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I am
reminded of the story of Hadiatu
Jalloh, a 7-year-old from Sierra Leone
who, with her mother, fled to Houston
to seek a lifesaving operation to rec-
tify complications from the practice of
female genital mutilation, from which
she suffered for more than a year.
This story reads: ‘‘The Woman’s Hos-
pital of Texas Saves an African Girl’s
Life. Dr. Susan Hardwick-Smith and
Dr. Eric Jones Provide Lifesaving Care
to 7-year-old Affected by Female Gen-
ital Mutilation,’’ only one of 200 mil-
lion girls.
This amendment will focus and pro-
vide an extra focus and extra resources
to have us be reminded to help these
young women, girls, across and around
the world. Let us give them a life-
saving hand up.
I ask my colleagues to support the
Jackson Lee amendment, lifesaving, so
that more girls do not have to get this
singular help from a singular hospital,
but they can be helped at home because
this dastardly act will be stopped.
Mr. Chair, I include a statement in
the RECORD from USAID, and I ask for
support of my amendment.
[From the Department of State and USAID]
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WORKING TOGETHER
FOR THE ABANDONMENT OF FEMALE GENITAL
MUTILATION/CUTTING
Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/
C) is a traditional practice that ranges from
nicking to total removal of the external fe-
male genitalia. UNICEF estimates that at
least 120 million girls and women have expe-
rienced FGM/C in the 29 countries in Africa
and the Middle East where the practice is
concentrated. Given present trends, as many
as 30 million girls under the age of 15 may
still be at risk. However, the data show that
FGM/C is becoming less prevalent overall,
and the younger generation is less vulner-
able to the practice. Though no religion
mandates the procedure, FGM/C is practiced
across cultures, religions and continents. It
is practiced in sub-Saharan Africa, northern
Iraq, Malaysia and Indonesia, and new evi-
dence is showing prevalence in other Middle
Eastern countries, including Yemen, Iran,
Syria, Oman and Saudi Arabia, and parts of
South Asia. The practice also can be found in
Europe, the United States, Australia and
other countries in the West where immi-
grants bring their cultural traditions with
them.
The reasons given for conducting FGM/C,
which is generally carried out between in-
fancy and the teen years, encompass beliefs
about health, hygiene, women’s sexuality,
rites of passage to adulthood and community
initiation rites. Research has shown that all
forms of the practice harm women’s health,
causing serious pain, trauma and frequently
severe physical complications, such as bleed-
ing, infections or even death. Long-term
complications may include recurrent infec-
tions, infertility, (1) and difficult or dan-
gerous childbirth that can result in the
death of the mother and infant. (2)
The U.S. Government has supported FGM/
C abandonment efforts since the early 1990s,
considering the practice not only a public
health concern but also a human rights issue
that violates a woman’s right to bodily in-
tegrity. In September 2000, the U.S. Agency
for International Development (USAID) offi-
cially incorporated elimination of FGM/C
into its development agenda, issuing an offi-
cial policy and strategy that underscored
FGM/C was a serious health and human
rights issue. The U.S. Department of State
emphasizes the need to raise awareness
among communities at the grassroots level,
through diplomatic and multilateral engage-
ment and within humanitarian settings to
address the practice of FGM/C.
In August 2012, the United States released
its first-ever Strategy to Prevent and Re-
spond to Gender-Based Violence Globally,
along with an accompanying Presidential
Executive Order directing its implementa-
tion. The strategy marshals the United
States’ capacity and expertise to establish a
coordinated, government-wide approach to
preventing and responding to gender-based
violence (GBV) and includes harmful tradi-
tional practices such as FGM/C.
The United States also pursues regional,
national and local coordination among inter-
national donors, governments and commu-
nity leaders. U.S. Government agencies are
actively engaged with internationally based
working groups to address FGM/C, including
the Donors Working Group (DWG) on FGM/
C,(3) which is composed of key international
governmental and intergovernmental organi-
zations and foundations committed to sup-
porting the abandonment of the practice.
USAID was a co-founder of the DWG and is

dedicated to expanding and strengthening
partnerships and increasing resources for
abandonment of this harmful traditional
practice. The group has collaboratively
issued a Platform for Action that summa-
rizes the collective programmatic approach
that focuses on the community approach to
social change.
U.S. GOVERNMENT EFFORTS
The State Department’s Secretary’s Office
of Global Women’s Issues (S/GWI) funded
community-based approaches involving men,
boys and all members of society in public
awareness and education campaigns. The
campaigns emphasized the detrimental con-
sequences of FGM/C on the physical and
mental health of girls, their families and the
overall community in order to promote long-
lasting solutions. S/GWI also worked with
the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and
Labor (DRL) to strengthen the reporting of
this issue in the Annual Country Reports on
Human Rights Practices. In addition to de-
scribing whether FGM/C occurred and the
type and category of FGM/C most common,
we are seeking information on international
and governmental efforts being taken to pre-
vent and address FGM/C (especially through
educational programs, but also by means of
shelters, hotlines and police training).
The Office of Population, Refugees, and
Migration (PRM) largely supports efforts in
humanitarian settings and among refugees
with programs designed to prevent and re-
spond to GBV, which includes FGM/C. These
organizations rely on U.S. Government as-
sistance to provide humanitarian assistance
to refugees, survivors of conflict, internally
displaced persons and stateless persons
worldwide. This encompasses a wide variety
of assistance, including the provision of pro-
tection, shelter, health care, water and sani-
tation, as well as the prevention of and as-
sistance to survivors of GBV and FGM/C.
PRM also supports targeted activities to pre-
vent FGM/C in Somali and Sudanese refugee
populations.
USAID supports implementing partners,
both from Washington and at the country
level, to provide communitybased programs
in key countries where the practice is preva-
lent. The Agency’s projects have supported
targeted programs in Burkina Faso,
Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya,
Mali and Nigeria, among others that con-
sider cultural sensitivities and are inte-
grated with health, economic, social or de-
mocracy and governance programs. USAID
programs are community based, involving
community and religious leaders as well as
women’s groups, men and youth to advance
the quality and effectiveness of abandon-
ment efforts and to improve conditions that
will lead to FGM/C abandonment.
PROJECTS IN-COUNTRY
Egypt—S/GWI supported a project working
in the community of Al Darb Al Ahmar in
Cairo called Creating Attitudes Favorable to
the Elimination of the Practice of FGM/C.
Through the dissemination of appropriate
and relevant information, coupled with edu-
cation initiatives and public awareness cam-
paigns, S/GWI supported the Aga Khan Foun-
dation to address and prevent violence
against women and girls, including FGM/C,
in select Cairo communities. Additionally,
the project provided training and capacity
building in victim advocacy and mental
health for health care providers, community
leaders and volunteers.
In 2008, the USAID mission in Egypt incor-
porated FGM/C into an existing community-
level health program, reinforced by select
national-level messaging and educational
messaging. The program furthered Egypt’s
ongoing efforts to bring about abandonment
of FGM/C, as it involved training staff at
both the Ministry of Health and nongovern-
mental organizations (NGOs) to broaden the
reach and coordinate with the government’s
National Council of Childhood and Mother-
hood to create a coherent national strategy.
Sudan—The Office of the U.S. Special
Envoy for Sudan and South Sudan is funding
a program in West Nile State to strengthen
the capacity of community leaders and local
organizations to effectively and sustainably
address FGM/C. The project mobilizes chil-
dren, women and men in the community to
support collective declarations of abandon-
ment of FGM/C. Through intensive trainings,
community leaders draw upon preexisting
social structures to engage with the wider
community and build community ownership
to end FGM/C sustainably.
Iraq—In coordination with the DRL, S/GWI
is funding a multidimensional program in
northern Iraq composed of integrated victim
services and a successful educational cam-
paign for village residents and political and
religious leaders, leading to the first-of-its-
kind declarations of villages being ‘‘Female
Genital Mutilation Free.’’
Kenya—PRM provides resources to NGO
partners to promote awareness and preven-
tion of FGM/C through community-based in-
stitutions and civil society, including men’s
groups, youth groups, women’s groups and
religious leaders. Other projects promote so-
cial and economic empowerment of women
and girls to reduce the risk of exposure to
GBV, including FGM/C, while educating par-
ticipants on the impact of harmful tradi-
tional practices, including FGM/C.
USAID conducted studies to better under-
stand the practice of FGM/C among the So-
malis in northeastern Kenya to inform the
design and implementation of interventions
and to clarify the correct Islamic under-
standing of FGM/C. The research provided
crucial evidence that FGM/C is neither a re-
ligious practice nor one sanctioned by Islam,
which clearly stipulates provisions for the
protection of basic human rights, upholds
the sanctity of the human body and pro-
hibits any practice that violates these rights
or causes harm to the body without justifica-
tion. The conclusions called on religious
scholars to collaborate with medical doctors
to make verdicts based on scientific facts
and to work with their communities to help
delink FGM/C from Islam.
USAID is supporting the launch of the
Kenya Centre of Excellence for FGM/C,
which will be based at Nairobi University, to
create a pan-African center for learning and
developing innovative research approaches.
The center will also train leaders and cham-
pions for working toward the abandonment
of FGM/C and welcomes support from the
international community and others to join
in this effort.
Ethiopia—In northern Ethiopia, the U.S.
Government supports an FGM/C awareness-
raising program for women and girls living
in Shimelba and My’Ayni refugee camps.
Specific efforts include coffee discussions
with girls, women, boys and men on GBV-re-
lated topics and services and a Girls’
Wellness Week, which promotes adolescent
girls’ health through a coming-of-age cere-
mony without FGM/C.
USAID supported collaboration with the
Ministry of Health and the National Com-
mittee on Traditional Practices to educate
communities on the harmful effects of FGM/
C. The program helped women and commu-
nity leaders to understand the motives of
‘‘FGM/C demanders,’’ respond to their con-
cerns and provide them with information on
the negative impact of the practice. More
than 2,250 people participated in FGM/C
abandonment activities; a national Anti-
FGM/C Women’s Leaders Team was estab-
lished, and a member of that team drafted a
law against FGM/C that the Ethiopian par-
liament passed in July 2004.
Mali—USAID helped the Ministry of
Health develop and pilot a national training
curriculum for primary medical providers to
increase their capacity to identify, treat or
refer FGM/C complications and educate and
counsel clients and community members on
the negative aspects of the practice. A net-
work of trained providers was created con-
sisting of extension workers from NGOs and
community and religious leaders. As a result
of their work, the percentage of men and
women who said they were in favor of aban-
doning FGM/C increased from 15 to 62 per-
cent, and the percentage who intended to
have FGM/C performed on their daughters
decreased from 81 to 33 percent.
Senegal—USAID has supported The Grand-
mother’s Project (GMP), which incorporates
FGM/C into a broader girls’ and women’s
health and family planning program to bring
about positive changes in community tradi-
tions. The approach involves grandmothers
and elderly women, a once marginalized
group, in social change. The project encour-
ages learning and communal decision-mak-
ing through open discussions about problems
confronting the community. The aim for
GMP is to have community members iden-
tify their problems and reach consensus on
possible solutions that best suit their needs,
leading to long-term and lasting change.
West Africa—USAID has supported Tostan,
a participatory education program that
works village by village to incorporate de-
mocracy, problem solving, basic mathe-
matics, literacy and essential health edu-
cation, including information about FGM/C,
into the learning experiences that ulti-
mately empower the entire community. As a
result of this multidimensional approach,
thousands of villages in West Africa have
publicly abandoned FGM/C and other harm-
ful traditional practices upon completion of
the Tostan program.
n the United States, in 2012, at the first-
ever Zero Tolerance Day event that was held
at the U.S. Department of State, former Sec-
retary of State Hillary Clinton spoke pas-
sionately about creating conditions for end-
ing FGM/C, so all girls can realize their full
potential. At that event, organized by
USAID and the State Department, a spark
was lit among the communities that have
worked tirelessly for years toward the aban-
donment of FGM/C. The event became a cat-
alyst for raising government and donor
awareness and was repeated in 2013 when it
was hosted by former Ambassador-at-Large
for Global Women’s Issues Melanne Verveer.
Ambassador Verveer led a panel discussion
that included Amina Salum Ali, Ambassador
of the African Union to the United States;
Dr. Nawal Nour, a Sudanese-American from
Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston;
Bacary Tamba from Tostan, an NGO in Sen-
egal; and Jessie Hexpoor from Hivos, an NGO
based in the Netherlands. They each have
made, and are continuing to make, extraor-
dinary contributions toward putting an end
to FGM/C, and the Ambassador noted, ‘‘are a
testament to why community-driven, holis-
tic approach is essential to achieving sus-
tainable progress.’’ The event brought to-
gether activists from the NGO community,
diplomatic corps and policymakers in the
U.S. Government to address ways various
stakeholders can work together toward zero
tolerance for FGM/C. The event also at-
tracted 1,648 online participants from 30
countries in an interactive virtual discus-
sion.
USAID has commissioned a desk review of
interventions, evaluations and reports pub-
lished since 2000 on ending FGM/C. Based on

this review, as well as key informant inter-
views with experts, USAID is drafting a re-
port called Ending Female Genital Mutila-
tion/Cutting: Lessons from Ten Years of
Progress. The report will review lessons
learned, promising approaches and rec-
ommendations for the future. By looking
back, policymakers and advocates will be
better able to move forward decisively to
create societies that allow women and girls
around the world to achieve their full poten-
tial.
Our vision of the way forward has been
sharpened by all the work that went on be-
fore this decade.
First, the centrality of ‘‘social norms’’—
what communities believe and how they act
and expect the members of that community
to act—must be addressed.
Second, a wide range of actors play pivotal
roles in the abandonment of FGM/C: men;
women; grandmothers; boys; girls; and com-
munity, health, religious and political lead-
ers.
Third, and perhaps most important, the
focus must be on holistic, integrated, multi-
sectoral approaches that bring together the
advocacy, policy-level work and community-
level transformation of social norms.

The Acting CHAIR (Mr. RICHMOND).
It is now in order to consider amend-
ment No. 80 printed in part B of House
Report 116–109.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 599, line 23, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(increased by $1,000,000) (reduced by
$1,000,000)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, this is
a very important amendment in the
cycle of life, protecting endangered
species, which give the joy of life and
understanding to the world, to the co-
existence of humans and these wonder-
ful species that have given us so much
knowledge.
My amendment makes a good bill
better by providing a $1 million focus
to combat the transportation of the re-
mains of endangered species, to bring
down the desire to go after these en-
dangered species.
So many of us remember, a few years
ago, the brutal killing of Cecil the lion.
At that time, I introduced and sought
the support of my colleagues as origi-
nal cosponsors of my legislation, Cecil
the Lion Endangered and Threatened
Species Act of 2015. This bill sought to
strengthen partner countries’ capacity
in countering wildlife trafficking and
designating major wildlife countries
for protection.
The amendment now is offered in the
same spirit: to prohibit the taking and
transportation of any endangered and
threatened species as a trophy to the
United States.
Currently, the Endangered Species
Act does not protect the majority of
wildlife animals killed. At this point,
we can choose to make wise decisions
that will sustain the global population,
or we can ignore the warning signs.
Climate change is not the only threat
facing our world. There is also massive
extinction of microscopic organisms to
more complex insects and animals.
More than 90 percent of all organisms
that have ever lived on Earth are ex-
tinct.
So I ask my colleagues to support the
Jackson Lee amendment.
Mr. Chair, I wish to thank Chairman MCGOV-
ERN and Ranking Member COLE of the Rules
Committee for making this Jackson Lee
Amendment in order.
I thank Chairwoman LOWEY and Ranking
Member ROGERS for their hard work in bring-
ing Division D, the State, Foreign Operations,
and Related Programs portion of this omnibus
appropriations legislative package, to the floor.
I thank them all for this opportunity to ex-
plain the Jackson Lee Amendment, which
makes a good bill even better by providing $1
million combat the transportation of the re-
mains of endangered species.
A few years ago, in light of the brutal killing
of Cecil the Lion, I introduced and sought the
support of my colleagues as original co-spon-
sors of my legislation entitled, Cecil the Lion
Endangered and Threatened Species Act of
2015.
That bill sought to strengthen partner coun-
tries’ capacity in countering wildlife trafficking
and designating major wildlife countries for
protection.
This Jackson Lee Amendment is offered in
the same spirit—to prohibit the taking and
transportation of any endangered or threat-
ened species as a trophy into the United
States.
This amendment provides $1 million to
focus efforts on poaching of endangered spe-
cies on protected preserves.
Hunting endangered species that are on
protected preserves should come with an ele-
ment of greater risk to those who engage in
this practice.
The amendment provides additional re-
sources to ensure better coordination and
monitoring of incidents like the killing of Cecil
the Lion, with a goal of holding people ac-
countable.
Currently, the Endangered Species Act
(ESA) does not protect the clear majority of
wild animals killed and imported.
Because of this loophole, tens of thousands
of wild animals are killed every year by trophy
hunters and transported into the United
States.
The conservation of endangered and threat-
ened species is critically important to the sus-
tainability of our biodiversity, ecosystem and
the beauty of wildlife as we know it.
Biodiversity and ecosystem balance are es-
sential to sustaining life as we know it on plan-
et earth.
The rate that species are disappearing glob-
ally can easily be compared to other mass ex-
tension events in our earth’s history.
Human life requires a health global biodiver-
sity and ecosystem.
At this point we can choose to make wise
decisions that will sustain the global popu-
lation or we can ignore the warning signs.
Climate change is not the only threat facing
our world—it is also massive extinction from
microscopic organisms to more complex in-
sects and animals.
More than 90 percent of all organisms that
have ever lived on Earth are extinct.
As new species evolve to fit ever changing
ecological niches, older species fade away.
But the rate of extinction is far from constant
or natural.
At least a handful of times in the last 500
million years, 50 to more than 90 percent of all
species on Earth have disappeared in a geo-
logical blink of the eye.
Another threat to endangered species are
terrorist organizations that pose a threat to our
environment and natural wildlife, utilizing the
funds from their illicit activity of wildlife poach-
ing to fund their terroristic activities.
Vulnerable species are at the mercy of
transnational terrorists groups whose actions
place these natural inhabitants of the earth in
danger of extinction.
For example, the population of African ele-
phants has decreased from 1.3 million to
400,000, with 22,000 poached in 2012.
Only 3,200 tigers remain in the wild, and
these tigers remain in danger of being
poached for their skins, bones and body parts.
This supports the efforts of the State De-
partment under the Transnational Organized
Crime Rewards Program to dismantle the wild-
life trafficking syndicates in the global south
from Africa to Asia.
I ask that my colleagues join me in sup-
porting this amendment that in a significant
way makes a difference for the safety and se-
curity of endangered species.
The food we eat, the water we drink and the
air we breathe relies upon biodiversity and
balance in ecosystems.
Scientist warn that our planet is now during
its sixth mass extinction of plants and animals.
Although extinction is a natural phe-
nomenon, it occurs at a natural ‘‘background’’
rate of about one to five species per year.
Scientists estimate we’re now losing species
at up to 1,000 times the background rate, with
literally dozens going extinct every day.
It could be a scary future indeed, with as
many as 30 to 50 percent of all species pos-
sibly heading toward extinction by the year
2050.
I ask my colleagues to support this Jackson
Lee Amendment.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of

There was no objection.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, while this
amendment does not have a budgetary
effect, I thank my colleague for raising
such an important issue.
I was pleased to be able to increase
the resources available in this bill by
$10 million, for a total of $100.6 million
to combat wildlife trafficking and
poaching.
Wildlife trafficking generates more
than $8 billion, annually. I am opti-
mistic that a comprehensive and appro-
priately resourced approach to address
the drivers of trafficking will help us
turn the corner.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment, and I reserve the balance

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I
thank the gentlewoman for her support
of my original amendment on female
genital mutilation, and I thank her for

H4646 June 13, 2019
amendment to ensure the United Na-
tions climate change organizations are
no longer used as an international
slush fund for ineffective climate
change research and projects.
Unfortunately, many of the United
Nations climate change organizations
operate with little oversight or ac-
countability, while being financed, in
part, by the American taxpayer.
Unelected bureaucrats and foreign
leaders across the globe should not
have greater control over U.S. policy
than our citizens and elected officials,
especially when we are paying for it.
The United Nations Intergovern-
mental Panel on Climate Change, or
IPCC, the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change, or
UNFCC, and the Green Climate Fund,
GCF, have been surrounded in con-
troversy since their inception.
The IPCC, which is broadly rep-
resented as the top authority on cli-
mate matters, was under fire when
emails were publicly released from a
university in England that showed that
leading global scientists—that 95 per-
cent, they are always quoting—inten-
tionally manipulated climate data and
suppressed legitimate arguments in
peer-reviewed journals.
Further, while the IPCC supposedly
issues assessments based upon so-called
independent surveys of published re-
search, some of the most influential
conclusions summarized in its report
have neither been based upon truly
independent research nor properly vet-
ted through accepted peer-reviewed
processes.
The United Nations Green Climate
Fund, which, unfortunately, received $1
billion in taxpayer funding thanks to
the Obama administration, has not ap-
proved a new project since 2017, causing
the executive director of the fund to re-
sign.
According to the Green Climate Fund
former co-chair, 30 percent—yes, 30 per-
cent—of the funds pledged are never
going to materialize.
Despite its stated goal of supporting
developing countries to pursue renew-
able energy sources, the Green Climate
Fund’s pledges that do materialize are
going to wealthy nations with little to
no effect on emissions.
Let me give a couple of examples.
One project to install a solar plant in
Kazakhstan directly benefited Chinese
construction companies instead of in-
vesting in Kazakhstan’s companies. Di-
rectly investing in one of our economic
rivals, China, is definitely the best use
of taxpayer funds.
Worse yet, the fund proposed a $9.8
million investment in the wealthy
kingdom of Bahrain’s oil sector. How is
this pursuing renewables in developing
countries?
Many former and current members of
the United Nations climate change or-
ganizations acknowledge they have
made little to no progress and don’t see
the organization being successful in
the future.
b 1045
This amendment is not about climate
change, but about the proper steward-
ship of taxpayer dollars.
Our constituents should not have to
foot the bill for organizations that
have no track record of success and
have a proven history of funding cor-
ruption and bad science to advance a
radical climate change agenda.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from New York is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chair, most of us, even my
friends across the aisle, agree that cli-
mate change is a real global threat.
Our military also believes this.
Prohibiting United States contribu-
tions to the multilaterals that combat
climate change is a shortsighted,
harmful policy that does not prepare
our country to face this threat.
I cannot emphasize enough that cli-
mate change is exacerbating the root
causes of conflict. We will see an in-
creasing demand on our humanitarian
and other resources if we don’t address
it now.
We cannot afford to stand idly by
while others address climate change,
nor will we simply avoid its impact. We
already feel its effects. This is pre-
cisely why we should not be alienating
multilateral partners who want to join
us in the fight.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I yield to
the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.
ROGERS).
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chair,
I thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Chair, as Members may recall,
during the climate negotiations lead-
ing up to the Paris conference, partici-
pants called for a Green Climate Fund
that would collect $100 billion a year
by 2020. Although Congress has yet to
appropriate a single dollar specifically
allocated for the Green Climate Fund,
the U.S. contributed over $800 million
under the Obama administration
through the Economic Support Fund.
However, a July 2018 report by Trans-
parency International concluded that
funding allocated from the Green Cli-
mate Fund was extremely vulnerable
to fraud, embezzlement, and rigged bid-
ding since corruption risk of processes
in infrastructure-related procurement
is extremely high.
Mr. Chair, I urge Members to support
the amendment, and I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, in times of
crisis, we seek to join forces with mul-
tilateral partners to help mitigate and
recover from damage, and our approach
to combating climate change should be
no different.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
oppose this amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, once
again, throwing money into the wind
when it has no accountability is fool-
hardy. We have seen these over and
over. Good process builds good policy is
good politics.
We want to see outcomes, and what
we are not seeing from this is out-
comes.
Mr. Chair, I ask everybody to join in.
This isn’t about climate change. This
is about accountability. We need to see
results, not just throwing money to the
wind.
Mr. Chair, I ask everybody to vote
for this amendment, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, my
amendment will direct $4 million with-

Water Commission to clarify the re-
sponsibility for the maintenance of the
International Outfall Interceptor, the
IOI. This is in addition to, and separate
from, the funding that currently exists
for the long-overdue repairs of the IOI.
I think it is important to put some
historical context into this amend-
ment.
The amendment seeks to clarify re-
sponsibility, the responsibility of the
community, the city of Nogales and
the county of Santa Cruz, that make
up the two major jurisdictions in that
area most affected by the need for this
amendment. It is an infrastructure
issue; it is an interceptor.
In 1944, the United States and Mexico
entered into an agreement in which
waste treatment was going to occur in
the United States for Nogales, Sonora
in Mexico.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4647
June 13, 2019
As time went by, since 1944, we now
find that the waste coming from Mex-
ico, 92 percent of the effort that the
wastewater facility has to undertake is
in Santa Cruz County and in Nogales.
I mention that because of how we
have to transport the waste from
Nogales, Mexico, to the United States
for treatment under the treaty that
Mexico and the U.S. signed is 8.5 miles
of pipes are needed to transport this
waste.
Over the last decades, and the people
of those communities can attest to
this, there is almost daily occurrences
and seasonal occurrences during the
rainy season of damage to this pipe-
line.
The infrastructure is as old as the
treaty. The infrastructure and pipes
are in dire need of repair. It has been
identified by people through the State
and Federal Government as an ur-
gency, a public health risk. When there
is discharge of waste into the drainage
areas, into the streams, into the river,
it creates an extraordinary public
health risk for the people of Santa Cruz
and Nogales, Arizona.
In 2017, the Governor of Arizona set
to commence the disaster declaration
process for the State of Arizona to se-
cure Federal assistance to remedy and
prevent raw sewage exposure to these
Arizona residents.
My amendment seeks to clarify that
very important issue of responsibility.
This is a treaty, an international
treaty, sanctioned by the State Depart-
ment that was established in 1944 that
deals with an infrastructure that is
falling apart and exposes issues of secu-
rity for the area, it is on the border.
There are issues of public health, and
issues of liability for the county of
Santa Cruz and the city of Nogales, a
fiscal responsibility that they cannot
undertake and a responsibility to re-
pair that they cannot undertake.
Because it is a treaty and it needs to
be treated as a responsibility of the
Federal Government, my amendment
seeks to address that issue.
This ongoing international issue that
impacts the safety and the well-being
of these communities across southern
Arizona has been addressed in the past.
Senators and Members of Congress on
both sides of the aisle of the Arizona
delegation have collaborated to remedy
the situation.
Mr. Chair, I would like at this point
to thank Senator MCSALLY for bring-
ing the companion legislation in the
Senate. I also want to thank the chair
of the committee and her staff for their
work on the bill.
Mr. Chair, I appreciate the oppor-
tunity to speak on this amendment. I
would urge my colleagues to support it,
and we can finally begin to find a solu-
tion to the public health threat to the
residents of the area, to security issues
underlying the whole tunnel system
and pipe system in Nogales, and estab-
lish the responsibility and account-
ability for transporting this waste
from Mexico to be treated in the
United States that was established by
treaty, placing it squarely where the
responsibility belongs, and that is with
the Federal Government in the enact-
ment of this treaty.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chair,
I rise in opposition to the amendment,
even though I am not opposed to it.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman is recognized for 5
minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chair-
man, we have no objection to this
amendment.
The amendment deals with issues
under the jurisdiction of the United
States International Boundary and
Water Commission, which is one of sev-
eral such commissions funded under
this act.
The IBWC’s mission is to provide bi-
national solutions to issues that arise
during the application of United
States-Mexico treaties regarding the
boundary demarcation, national owner-
ship of waters, sanitation, water qual-
ity, and flood control in the entire re-
gion, in the border region.
This amendment addresses a long-
running problem involving a pipeline,
the International Outfall Interceptor,
it is called, that transports sewage
from both sides of the border to the
Nogales International Wastewater
Treatment Plant. That plant is co-
owned by the IBWC and the city of
Nogales.
Mr. Chairman, we can all understand
the desire to enjoy clean, safe water,
and we have no objection to this
amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
Arizona (Mr. GOSAR).
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Chair, I want to applaud the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA),
but I also want to highlight that there
is a further issue that we need to ad-
dress.
Not only is there a pipeline problem,
but there is a floodplain problem that
needs to have some jurisdiction and
some changes and involvement.
We have become the victims in re-
gard to when floods run. We see our in-
frastructure on this side of that inter-
national border being destroyed.
Mr. Chair, this is a golden oppor-
tunity to highlight an opportunity that
is a joint venture between the two
countries that we can actually see
some camaraderie to actually facili-
tate change.
Mr. Chair, I applaud the gentleman
for bringing this up, and I look forward
to seeing us remedy this continuing
problem.
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield such time as she may con-
sume to the gentlewoman from New
York (Mrs. LOWEY), the chairwoman of
the full committee.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Chair, while this amendment
does not have a budgetary effect, I
would like to thank the gentleman for
raising such an important issue.
The International Outfall Interceptor
pipeline is long overdue for repair.
When wastewater leaks from the pipe-
line, it poses a severe public health
risk and a threat to southern Arizona’s
regional economy and drinking water.
Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues
to support the amendment.
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chair,
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I

ican workers. . . . and taxpayers to ab-
sorb the cost in terms of lost jobs,
lower wages, shuttered factories, and
vastly diminished economic produc-
tion.’’
The U.N. Framework Convention on
Climate Change has also become a
mechanism for executive overreach.
For example, when President Obama
signed us up in the Paris Agreement,
he did not consult Congress in any way.
This was a direct assault on Congress’
constitutional duty to approve any
treaty signed on to by the United
States.
Fortunately, there is an alternative.
Mr. Chairman, the best way to improve
our environment and ensure our eco-
nomic prosperity is to allow energy in-
novations in this country, not by send-
ing millions of dollars to some
transnational organization.
We have new innovations being im-
plemented in our energy sector as we
speak, every day. From carbon seques-
tration coal plants in Texas, to the
shale revolution in the Midwest, to
solar facilities in my home State of Ar-
izona, locally driven solutions are cre-
ating thousands of jobs and benefiting
our environment.
It is a simple concept. The people
who depend upon our energy resources
to provide security for their families
and communities understand those re-
sources best. States and municipalities
are best suited to deal with local issues
than are the distant out-of-touch
Washington and U.N. bureaucrats.
The facts are clear: The U.S. has had
one of the largest absolute decreases in
carbon emissions of any country in the
world. From 2005 to 2017, the U.S. cut
862 million tons of carbon, a 14 percent
decline. Over the same period, global
emissions increased by 26 percent.
China increased its emissions by 4 bil-
lion tons, and India increased its car-
bon dioxide emissions by 1.3 billion
tons, a 70 percent increase.
America’s energy renaissance is the
backbone of our economy. It is a story
of freedom, prosperity, and oppor-
tunity. The story of the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate
Change is a much different one, one
that is characterized by a one-size-fits-
all policy that gives special preferences
to some of the world’s worst polluters,
like China and India.
This isn’t a partisan issue. This is
about doing what is right for America
and protecting freedom and oppor-
tunity for our children and grand-
children. I urge all Members on both
sides of the aisle to support my amend-
ment.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in
opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from New York is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
The U.N. Framework Convention on
Climate Change brings together crit-
ical multilateral partners so the
United States does not have to combat
climate change alone. By supporting
the UNFCCC, we are signaling to the
world that we are committed and seri-
ous about combating this threat.
The United States has been a party
to the UNFCCC since 1992. As chair-
woman of the House Appropriations
Committee, I will never support efforts
that jeopardize our treaty-based obli-
gations, and I urge my colleagues to
oppose this amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, once
again, we hear the same lame excuse
over and over again, that doing the
same thing over and over, we are going
to get a different result. Well, that
doesn’t work anymore.
Trust is a series of promises kept.
Why don’t we set by example? And that
is exactly what we are proposing here.
The United States, by our tech-
nology, by our innovation, has shown
the way in regards to combating cli-
mate change. That is exactly the way
that we ought to handle it, not by some
failed multinational bureaucracy that
uses the United States as a slush fund.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, the
United States must remain committed
to our global partners because climate
change just cannot be fought alone.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to oppose this amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, once
again, doing the same thing over and
over again and expecting a different re-
sult is insanity. Once again, we have
seen the ineptness of the United Na-
tions in regard to this. We have seen
the misuse of money to developed na-
tions like China and India, and we
allow them to continue to pollute when
we set the example.
I like the idea of setting the example
for everybody else to follow. We are the
innovators. We are the leaders. We
ought to establish that. I ask every-
body to vote for this amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I
demand a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Arizona will be
postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 84 OFFERED BY MS. SPEIER
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 84 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 414, line 11, after the dollar amount,
insert ‘‘(increased by $40,000,000) (reduced by
$40,000,000)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. SPEIER) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California.
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, I rise
with great enthusiasm this morning to
support an amendment that would des-
ignate $40 million from the assistance
for Europe and Eurasia fund to Arme-
nian democracy assistance. This
amendment is cosponsored by the other
Democratic chairs of the Caucus on Ar-
menian Issues here in Congress.
In the last year, Armenia has under-
gone a breathtaking transformation
from a stagnant autocracy to a very vi-
brant democracy. The images of Arme-
nia’s Velvet Revolution bring a smile
to my face every time I think of it,
having people dancing in the streets,
having a blockade, but a blockade of
small toys by children in the town
square.
The amazing part of all of this is that
this democracy occurred with not one
drop of blood being shed. So it is very
important, at this point in time, that
we do everything in our power to sup-
port this new democracy.
Since the revolution, Armenia has
held fair and free democratic elections
that swept Nikol Pashinyan to power.
Recently, his government signed an
agreement with the United States pro-
viding up to $60 million, over 2 to 3
years, to promote economic growth and
good governance in Armenia.
Although these efforts are welcome,
they are not enough. Armenia has a
rare and potentially fleeting window of
opportunity to consolidate and build
upon its democratic gains. Funda-
mental changes to its constitution,
electoral code, and governance institu-
tions cannot be achieved by repack-
aging existing aid under a new header.
Armenia has earned a clear signal
that the United States supports its
democratic transformation and re-
sources will be brought to them to
carry out that transformation. This
amendment would provide $40 million
in 1 year to supercharge Armenia’s
democratic progress. Armenia would
continue to lead the process, but the
U.S. expertise and assistance would
serve as a true catalyst.
This particular fund is filled with
over $700 million. We are already giv-
ing $250 million to Ukraine, over $50

million to Moldova, and $83 million to
Georgia; so a $40 million commitment
to a country that, on its own, has de-
livered democracy is a small gift. I
urge that we support that.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise in opposition to the amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is

Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chair,
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Will the gentlewoman
yield?
Ms. SPEIER. I yield to the gentle-
woman from New York.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, while
this amendment does not have a budg-
etary effect, I would like to thank my
friend for raising such an important
issue.
The progress made in Armenia’s
transition to democracy and the Velvet
Revolution is a refreshing development
at a time when so many other coun-
tries are headed in the opposite direc-
tion. This account funds critical pro-
grams to counter Russian aggression
and influence in Europe and Eurasia
and support to key partners like
Ukraine and Georgia. I am prepared to
work to provide the necessary re-
sources to encourage continued
progress in Armenia, and I am willing
to accept the amendment.
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentlewoman and leader of our Ap-
propriations Committee for her sup-
port, and I am grateful beyond words.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chair-
man, the funding directed in this
amendment is a significant increase
above current levels. It could result in
funds being cut from important part-
ners in Europe facing Russian aggres-
sion. For this reason, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER).
The question was taken; and the Act-

Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to

Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I move
to strike the last word.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from New York is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield
to the gentlewoman from California
(Ms. SPEIER).
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentlewoman from New York for
yielding.
I rise to engage in a colloquy with
the chairwoman of the State-Foreign
Operations Appropriations Sub-
committee. I rise today to discuss the
immense value to the American tax-
payer and Congress provided by the
Special Inspector General for Afghani-
stan Reconstruction.
Since 2002, the U.S. Government has
spent over $126 billion—that is a b—
building the Afghan security forces,
promoting good governance, and con-
ducting development assistance. Cre-
ated in the 2008 National Defense Au-
thorization Act, the SIGAR, as we refer
to it, has helped to oversee the effec-
tiveness of these programs and guarded
against waste, fraud, abuse, and mis-
management.
The SIGAR has alerted Congress to
programs stymied by corruption,
flawed leadership, and poor design,
while also providing implementing
agencies with lessons learned that have
improved their efforts. I believe that
SIGAR provides immense value to the
American public and that their efforts
should continue so long as the United
States continues to allocate significant
sums of money to the Afghan recon-
struction.
I want to ask the chairwoman to
clarify that no language in the bill’s
House report should be construed as
creating an end date for the SIGAR.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I thank my
friend for bringing this issue to our at-
tention.
The committee takes seriously over-
sight of taxpayer dollars. I concur with
the gentlewoman’s remarks. The
SIGAR continues to serve American
taxpayers by reporting on instances of
waste, fraud, and abuse in Afghanistan.
The language included in the House
report was not intended to suggest that
the committee expects or is directing
SIGAR to cease operations by Sep-
tember 30, 2021. Rather, the require-
ment in the House report is for SIGAR
to provide a plan on its future state
considering the administration’s pro-
posing drawdown in Afghanistan.
We must protect American taxpayer
funds from waste, fraud, and abuse. I
look forward to working with SIGAR
on effectively achieving this important
mission as the U.S. engagement with
Afghanistan continues to evolve.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The Committee
will rise informally.

SPEIER) assumed the chair.

AMENDMENT NO. 85 OFFERED BY MR. MEADOWS
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. RICHMOND).
It is now in order to consider amend-
ment No. 85 printed in part B of House
Report 116–109.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 560, line 13, after the dollar amount
insert ‘‘(increased by $33,000,000)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentleman
from North Carolina (Mr. MEADOWS)
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from North Carolina.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chair, this
amendment withholds an additional $33
million from Pakistan, in addition to
the $33 million that is currently being
withheld. This seems like it should not
be necessary, but, indeed, it is.
Dr. Shakil Afridi has been in prison
for his role in helping the United
States Government locate Osama bin
Laden. The message, Mr. Chair, needs
to be clear that imprisonment, in vio-
lation of human rights, of this fine doc-
tor needs to cease.
Mr. Chair, you probably find the
same thing back home in your State as
I do in mine. Many of my constituents
question why we are sending money to
Pakistan anyway, let alone if they are
going to violate the human rights of
someone who has helped bring justice
to a terrorist.
In prison since 2011, Dr. Afridi was al-
most entirely restricted. He was pre-
vented from meeting with his lawyers.
Indeed, his previous lawyer was mur-
dered. Dr. Afridi has been tortured, re-
portedly. He has been described as now
looking like a skeleton.
Mr. Chair, this body needs to stand
unanimously together and send a clear
message to the Pakistani Government
that we will not tolerate this kind of
behavior and this violation of human
rights. We need to stand with his wife,
and we need to stand for freedom.
We appreciate the support of Free-
dom House in supporting this amend-
ment.
Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he
may consume to the gentleman from
Kentucky (Mr. ROGERS), someone I
fondly refer to as ‘‘Mr. Chairman,’’ who
has been a leader on so many of these
issues.
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chair,
I thank the gentleman for yielding the
time.
Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this
amendment.
This amendment would double the
amount withheld from assistance to
Pakistan until Dr. Shakil Afridi has
been released from prison and cleared
of all charges relating to assistance
provided to the U.S. in locating Osama
bin Laden.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4650 June 13, 2019
I note that U.S. aid to Pakistan has
been substantially decreased in recent
years, including the suspension of all
security assistance funding for the
Pakistani military because of insuffi-
cient cooperation on counterterrorism.
Similarly, the 2020 request for eco-
nomic assistance to Pakistan has been
reduced from $200 million to $48 mil-
lion. Remaining U.S. programs in Paki-
stan help combat violent extremism,
support the rule of law, and counter
narcotics, including along the Afghani-
stan-Pakistan border.
Nonetheless, this amendment sends a
strong signal that the United States
views the charges against Dr. Afridi as
baseless and that we will continue to
press for his release.
Mr. Chair, I urge support of the gen-
tleman’s amendment.
Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Chair, I thank
the gentleman for his passion.
In the interest of time, I encourage
all of my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle to stand for freedom and to
make sure that what we do is send a
clear message to those who will stomp
out and try to eliminate those who are
freedom-loving across the globe.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I claim the
time in opposition, although I am not
opposed.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentlewoman from New York
is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I share the
gentleman’s frustration that the cur-
rent withholding, a restriction that has
been in place since 2014 that has with-
held $165 million to date, has not yet
compelled the Government of Pakistan
to release Dr. Afridi from prison.
It has been reported that after being
held for 8 years by the Pakistani Gov-
ernment, Dr. Afridi’s health has begun
to deteriorate. We must increase pres-
sure on the Government of Pakistan to
release Dr. Afridi.
Mr. Chair, I support this amendment,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tleman from North Carolina (Mr.
MEADOWS).
The question was taken; and the Act-

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO
THE ACTIONS AND POLICIES OF
CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE GOV-
ERNMENT OF BELARUS—MES-
SAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC.
NO. 116–39)
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message
from the President of the United
States; which was read and, together
with the accompanying papers, referred
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs
and ordered to be printed:
To the Congress of the United States:
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90
days before the anniversary date of its
declaration, the President publishes in
the Federal Register and transmits to
the Congress a notice stating that the
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to
the Federal Register for publication the
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to the
actions and policies of certain mem-
bers of the Government of Belarus and
other persons to undermine democratic
processes or institutions of Belarus
that was declared in Executive Order
13405 of June 16, 2006, is to continue in
effect beyond June 16, 2019.
The actions and policies of certain
members of the Government of Belarus
and other persons to undermine
Belarus’s democratic processes or insti-
tutions, to commit human rights
abuses related to political repression,
and to engage in public corruption con-
tinue to pose an unusual and extraor-
dinary threat to the national security

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise for
the purpose of inquiring of the major-
ity leader the schedule for next week.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman
from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the House
majority leader.
Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman,
Mr. SCALISE, the Republican whip, for
yielding.
On Tuesday, the House will meet at
12 p.m. for morning-hour debate, and 2
p.m. for legislative business, with votes
postponed until 6:30 p.m.
Members are being advised that de-
bate on amendments to H.R. 2740 will
begin at 3 p.m. on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and Thursday, the
House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-
hour debate and 12 p.m. for legislative
business.
Members are reminded that when the
House is considering appropriation
bills, votes will occur after 7 p.m.
On Friday, the House will meet at 9
a.m. for legislative business. Last votes
on Friday may occur between 2 and 3
p.m.
We will consider several bills under
suspension of the rules. The complete
list of suspension bills will be an-
nounced by the close of business to-
morrow.
The House will continue consider-
ation of H.R. 2740, the Departments of
Labor, Health and Human Services,
and Education, and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act, 2020.
The House will also begin consider-
ation of H.R. 3055, which is the Com-
merce, Justice, Science, Agriculture,
Rural Development, Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, Interior, Environment,
Military Construction, Veterans Af-
fairs, Transportation, and Housing and
Urban Development Appropriations
Act.
This will be the second minibus that
will be coming to the floor over this
work period. It is my intention, Mr.
Speaker, to pass all 12 appropriation
bills in this work period.
This package is yet another step to-
ward the House doing its work to avoid
another shutdown, which has such a
negative effect on the Nation and a
negative effect on the morale of those
who work for the American people in
the Federal Government.
Hopefully, it will result in an agree-
ment between the House and the Sen-
ate, and a signature of the President,
which will preclude a repeat of the
shutdown.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I know
we have been starting and going
through the appropriations process. I
would like to ask the majority leader
about the conversation we have been
having for weeks and weeks, going
back to May 1, when the President sub-
mitted a supplemental emergency
spending bill to address this serious hu-
manitarian crisis at our southern bor-
der.
We have had this conversation mul-
tiple times in the colloquy. I continued
to ask the majority leader when we are
going to see a bill on this House floor
to address this serious crisis. Each
week, we have not been given an actual
timeline. In fact, as the majority lead-
er just went over the schedule, there is
still no mention of a supplemental bill
to deal with this crisis.
I know we have been seeing multiple
attempts by Members from our party. I
would hope that there are some from
the gentleman’s party that have recog-
nized that we have to deal with this.
We can’t keep putting it off.
If the gentleman would look at The
New York Times just this week, the
headline is: ‘‘When Will Congress Get
Serious About the Suffering at the Bor-
der?’’
I want to read a couple of statements
from it because it contains some things
that we have been saying that are just
not getting enough coverage across the
country. More and more now, we are
seeing how serious this is. This is
about to come to a head, not in
months, not in years, but in days.
We are talking about young children
who are right now in the custody of the
Department of Homeland Security,
many of whom are coming over with
health diseases, serious diseases, who
they are able to turn over right now to
Health and Human Services to care for
their needs.
They are about to completely run out
of money. This isn’t a new develop-
ment. They have been saying this over
and over for weeks.
The Presidential supplemental re-
quest came out on May 1. On May 3, at
our colloquy, I inquired of the majority
leader: When will this happen? We
never got a timeline. On May 10 in our
colloquy, I asked the majority leader:
When will Congress address this? Still
no timeline. Just last week, I brought
it up again.
I want to read what The New York
Times said in their description of how
serious this is, they said: ‘‘It’s time to
cut the squabbling and pass an emer-
gency relief package.’’
Here is a comment from John Sand-
ers, who is the Acting Commissioner of
Customs and Border Protection, ‘‘We
are in a full-blown emergency, and I
cannot say this stronger: The system is
broken.’’
Just in this fiscal year, HHS has
taken charge of nearly 41,000 unaccom-
panied children. On average, every sin-
gle day, over 200 young children are re-
ferred to HHS for medical needs.
HHS is about to run out of money in
a matter of days, and Congress has still
not taken action.
There is a letter that I will be happy
to enter in the RECORD.
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH &
HUMAN SERVICES AND U.S. DE-
PARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECU-
RITY.
DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS: We continue
to experience a humanitarian and security
crisis at the southern border of the United
States, and the situation becomes more dire
each day. On May 1, 2019, the Administration
requested $4.5 billion in emergency appro-
priations for the Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS), the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS), the Department
of Defense, and the Department of Justice to
address the immediate humanitarian crisis
at our southern border. We write today to
ask that you appropriate this funding as
soon as possible.
We cannot stress enough the urgency of
immediate passage of emergency supple-
mental funding. This funding will provide re-
sources that our Departments need to re-
spond to the current crisis, enable us to pro-
tect the life and safety of unaccompanied
alien children (UAC), and help us to continue
providing the full range of services to the
children in our custody.
While Congress has been considering the
request, the average daily number of UAC in
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
custody has grown from nearly 870 on May 1
to more than 2,300 today. This is because the
number of arriving children greatly exceeds
existing HHS capacity. As of June 10, 1,900
processed UAC were in CBP custody awaiting
placement in HHS care. However, HHS had
fewer than 700 open beds in which to place
them. HHS has significantly increased the
rates at which we are discharging children to
sponsors, but UAC are waiting too long in
CBP facilities that are not designed to care
for children.
This is a direct result of the unprecedented
number of arriving children. As of June 10,
DHS has referred over 52,000 UAC to HHS
this fiscal year (FY), an increase of over 60
percent from FY 2018. Preliminary informa-
tion shows nearly 10,000 referrals in May—
one of the highest monthly totals in the his-
tory of the program. If these numbers con-
tinue, this fiscal year HHS will care for the
largest number of UAC in the program’s his-
tory. HHS continues to operate near capac-
ity, despite placing UAC with sponsors at
historically high rates. HHS is working dili-
gently to expand its bed capacity to ensure
that it can keep pace, and based on the an-
ticipated growth, HHS expects its need for
additional bed capacity to continue.
On May 17, the Administration notified
Congress of an anticipated deficiency in
HHS’s Office of Refugee Resettlement’s
(ORR) UAC program, as required by law. Ab-
sent an emergency appropriation, HHS an-
ticipates running out of funding as soon as
this month. The Anti-Deficiency Act, which
is a criminal statute, requires HHS to take
actions to minimize the deficiency and only
to fund operations that are essential for the
safety of human life and protection of prop-
erty—similar to those activities allowed dur-
ing a government shutdown. In the last few
weeks, because of rapidly depleting funds
caused by the border surge, ORR was re-
quired by law to scale back or discontinue
awards, and had to instruct grantees that
new awards cannot be used for UAC activi-
ties that are not directly necessary for the
protection of life and property, including
education services, legal services, and recre-
ation. This was done solely to ensure full
compliance with the Anti-Deficiency Act and
stretch existing funds as far as possible for
the life and safety of children.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4671
June 13, 2019
ORR would not have had to take these ac-
tions to preserve essential operations if re-
quested supplemental funding had been pro-
vided. lf Congress acts quickly to provide the
requested supplemental funding to address
the border surge, ORR will be able to restore
these services. Until such funding is pro-
vided, ORR will only be able to pay for essen-
tial services to protect life and safety.
It is unprecedented for a critical child wel-
fare program to run out of funding, and ORR
is in close contact with grantees about ex-
pected impacts. Once the UAC program is en-
tirely out of funding, grantees will have to
care for children with no federal reimburse-
ment until an emergency appropriation is
enacted. It is unclear if grantees would be
operationally able to continue caring for
UAC, as many are small nonprofit organiza-
tions. This funding lapse could also nega-
tively impact grantees’ willingness to care
for UAC over the longer term and ORR’s im-
mediate ability to add new child care facili-
ties to address the overflow of children in
DHS border facilities that were not designed
for children. Our valued federal employees in
ORR who care for children and place them
with sponsors would be required to work
without pay.
It is not only the UAC program that will be
impacted. On May 16, HHS notified Congress
that the Anti-Deficiency Act requires HHS
to reallocate up to $167 million from Refugee
Support Services (RSS), Victims of Traf-
ficking, and Survivors of Torture to the UAC
program if activities do not meet the cri-
teria in 31 U.S.C. § 1515(b)(l)(B). Last week,
HHS informed the state refugee coordinators
and refugee resettlement grantees in 49
states and the District of Columbia that
ORR was withholding third quarter funding
for those programs. The RSS program ad-
dresses barriers to employment for refugees
such as: social adjustment, interpretation
and translation, day care for children, and
citizenship and naturalization. Again, this
was not a decision that ORR wanted to
make, or took lightly. HHS’s hand was
forced by the current funding situation and
the law. HHS must ensure that it is fully
compliant with the AntiDeficiency Act and
that HHS stretch its existing funds as far as
possible to protect the life and safety of chil-
dren who are presently, or should be, in HHS
care.
While the primary concern of both of our
Departments is the safety of children in our
care, DHS faces changing dynamics at the
border that continue to stress its ability to
respond. For example:
More groups are illegally entering the
United States, and they are getting larger.
On May 29, U.S. Border Patrol (USBP)
agents apprehended over 1,000 migrants ille-
gally crossing from Mexico as one group,
overtaxing border operations. Over 400 mi-
grants were apprehended within five minutes
only two weeks before.
The number of migrants has escalated.
with more vulnerable populations arriving.
In May 2019, an average of more than 4,650
people daily illegally crossed into the United
States or arrived at ports of entry without
proper documentation. In May 2017, the daily
average was under 650 illegal crossings per
day.
May 2019 experienced more than 144,000
total enforcements on the southern border, a
32 percent increase over the previous month
and the highest monthly total since March
2006. This follows two months exceeding
100,000—sustained levels not seen in over 12
years.
As of June 10, 2019, more than 17,000 people
are in CBP custody, including over 2,500
UAC.
The USBP apprehended nearly 85,000 indi-
viduals in family units in May 2019 along the
Southwest border. An additional 4,100 indi-
viduals in a family unit were deemed inad-
missible at Southwest border ports of entry.
The vast majority of these individuals have
been released into the country due to a lack
of space and authority to detain them. By
comparison, in all of FY 2012, USBP appre-
hended just over 11,000 individuals in a fam-
ily unit.
Border Patrol agents are spending more
than 50 percent of their time caring for fami-
lies and children, providing medical assist-
ance, driving buses, and acting as food serv-
ice workers instead of performing law en-
forcement duties.
Border Patrol agents are making on aver-
age 70 trips to hospitals every day to ur-
gently get care to these individuals, further
diminishing their ability to perform their of-
ficial duties.
The Centralized Processing Center in
McAllen, Texas, and other CBP facilities
have experienced outbreaks of flu which has
required standing up separate quarantine fa-
cilities to reduce the risk of further exposing
children and other vulnerable populations to
infectious disease. While agents are pro-
viding the best care possible, these groups
need more appropriate care, and they need it
now.
If DHS does not receive additional funding,
it will be forced to take drastic measures in
August that will impact other critical pro-
grams that support DHS missions through-
out the country. All DHS components, in-
cluding the Transportation Security Admin-
istration, the Federal Emergency Manage-
ment Agency, the Cybersecurity and Infra-
structure Security Agency, the Coast Guard,
and portions of CBP supporting legal trade
and travel will be required to redirect man-
power and funding to support measures to
address the crisis.
In addition to the supplemental, it is clear
that we need bipartisan legislation to ad-
dress the causes of this crisis. We urge Con-
gress to take swift action to provide the nec-
essary funding to address the severe humani-
tarian and operational impacts of this crisis
and to enact reforms to the root causes of
these problems so that they do not persist
into the future.
Thank you for your most immediate atten-
tion to this matter. A copy of this response
will also be sent to your state’s executive
leadership.
Sincerely,
ALEX M. AZAR II,
Secretary, U.S. De-
partment of Health
& Human Services.
KEVIN MCALEENAN,
Acting Secretary, U.S.
Department of
Homeland Security.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I know
the majority leader received this let-
ter, as has the Speaker, from the Sec-
retary of HHS and the Secretary of
Homeland Security earlier this week,
saying: ‘‘We cannot stress enough the
urgency of immediate passage of emer-
gency supplemental funding. This fund-
ing will provide resources that our De-
partments need to respond to the cur-
rent crisis, enable us to protect the life
and safety of unaccompanied alien
children, and help us to continue pro-
viding the full range of services to the
children in our custody.’’
They are trying to take care of
health and life needs. This is life and
death we are talking about.
In a matter of days, they will run out
of money. This has been going on for
weeks and weeks, and Congress hasn’t
taken action.
I would ask the majority leader if we
can get a commitment that this House
will take up this legislation that has
been sent weeks ago. The majority has
had time to review it and hasn’t ad-
dressed this serious problem. When are
we going to see action from the House?
I yield to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER).
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for his comments.
First of all, I think there is broad
agreement that there is, indeed, an
emergency, that we need to act, and we
need to act as quickly as possible.
As the gentleman probably knows be-
cause it was reported in the press, we
had a leadership meeting with the ap-
propriators yesterday, urging the
swiftest action possible.
I will tell my friend, to put this in
context, the gentleman indicates the
system is broken. I would agree with
that. I think everybody agrees with it.
The Senate tried to fix it in 2013. We
have urged for the last 6 years for a bill
to be put on the floor on comprehen-
sive immigration reform. While it may
not have totally solved this issue, it
certainly would have addressed this
issue.
Notwithstanding that historical per-
spective and context, it is clear that
there is an emergency and that we need
to respond. I would hope that my friend
would say that we would respond in the
sense of the emergency that exists. I
think both sides believe that we ought
to deploy emergency resources to deal
with the emergency.
If we can limit it to that, I suggest to
my friend, we will have a lot better op-
portunity to get a consensus. Now,
what I am saying is, I frankly think
the administration conflates border en-
forcement and some of the things it
wants to do on enforcement and hu-
manitarian relief.
If we can pass a bill that is limited to
humanitarian relief, I hope that we
could pass it as soon as possible, mean-
ing next week. I will tell the gentleman
that Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD has been
working very hard to reach a consensus
not only within her committee but
reach a consensus with those who have
a particular focus on it. The Congres-
sional Hispanic Caucus, as you know, is
very concerned about the humani-
tarian situation at the border, as we all
are.
The New York Times editorial, which
I brought to the attention of my Mem-
bers, and they had already seen it, I
think The New York Times’ premise is
correct. We need to act. We need to act
quickly. We are working toward that
end.
I would hope that we could move as
early as next week. I can’t promise
that, but I am hopeful that we can
reach a consensus.
It would be nice if we could reach a
consensus between the House and the
Senate. I know the Senate talked
about acting next week. We will see
what they do.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4672 June 13, 2019
I guarantee that this week, over the
weekend, or the beginning of next
week, Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD and others
are working to get a bill together that
we believe could get a majority of the
House and a majority of the Senate and
the signature of the President because
we need to act. The gentleman is abso-
lutely correct.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I would
reiterate the urgency of acting next
week, not trying to act next week.
b 1400
I don’t have an opportunity to do this
often, so I will quote The New York
Times again because it is not some-
thing I am normally used to doing. But
to quote them: ‘‘It’s time to cut the
squabbling and pass an emergency re-
lief package.’’
I know there might be differences
over some of the details. There is no
wall funding in the request for the
President.
The big battles that we had last year,
this year, I am sure, will continue on
how we can actually secure the border.
I would hope we, over the next few
months as we debate the appropria-
tions bills, keep coming to an agree-
ment on how to secure America’s
southern border.
The magnitude of this problem can’t
be overstated. Just in the last month,
over 144,000 people came across ille-
gally that we apprehended. Those are
just the ones we know about. This is 3
months in a row now we have had more
than 100,000 people coming across ille-
gally. The average is over 3,000 people
per day.
And when we look at the amount of
young children who are coming across
sick, again, more than 200 children
every single day are being referred to
HHS for healthcare needs. That is the
crisis that we want to address today.
This isn’t the bigger debate on wall
funding, and so I hope we can separate
those two, but recognize the Presi-
dent’s request did not include a dime
for wall funding for this humanitarian
crisis. I would hope we would treat it
in an isolated way, as it was submitted.
I would just refer to the gentleman
when Barack Obama was President and
we were in the majority. While we had
differences with President Obama, in-
cluding on immigration, he sent out a
request in 2014. His request was for $3.7
billion for an additional border supple-
mental to address the crisis at the bor-
der.
We still had a crisis back then. We
have a worse crisis today. But when
President Obama submitted that re-
quest for $3.7 billion, we didn’t squab-
ble over it. I am sure we might have
had some disagreements, but in less
than a month, we, this Republican
House, passed the full amount that
Barack Obama requested when he was
President and sent it back out of the
House. That was quick action. I am
just urging we have the same kind of
quick action.
We can disagree on the wall funding.
Again, this isn’t that disagreement.
This is a request from the President
that was made in May and that is lit-
erally coming to a head in days, where
HHS has told all of us—nobody is dis-
puting it—HHS completely runs out of
money and has no ability to take, safe-
ly, any more children who are being
sent to them.
And they are coming over at more
than 200 kids a day not who are coming
across illegally, but as Homeland Secu-
rity receives them, over 200 a day have
serious enough health needs that they
are sending them to DHS or HHS. HHS
has told us clearly that they will run
out of money in a matter of days. I
hope it is in a matter of days that we
take up the request.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the comments, and I understand
the deep concern. We have deep con-
cern on this side of the aisle about the
administration’s attitude, for instance,
when they take children from their
parents and send them to far-off places
and don’t keep sufficient records to re-
unite those children.
So, yes, we share the concern about
the humanitarian crisis, but we are
also concerned that the administration
that has done some of the things that
it has done and that has made it much
more difficult for people to pursue asy-
lum to which they may be entitled
under American law, we want to make
sure that, in fact, we are dealing with
humanitarian issues that the gen-
tleman raises and not issues that seem
to be related by this administration.
We have cause for concern and we
have cause for caution, but I am hope-
ful, as I said, that we can get this done,
because I don’t disagree with the gen-
tleman, and The New York Times and
we don’t disagree.
There is a very serious challenge at
the border to make sure that people
are safe, kept in places where they are
warm and out of the elements and
where they can be treated in a way
that Americans would want to treat
others and would want to be treated
themselves. So I am hopeful that we
will get this done sooner rather than
later.
But Mr. Obama asked for that supple-
mental. The other thing he asked for
for many, many years was let’s get a
comprehensive immigration bill
passed. In my view, had that been put
on the floor, it would have had a ma-
jority of votes in the House. It was
never put on the floor for years—not
months and not days, for years. That is
part of the solution. Irrespective of
that, we need to act as soon as pos-
sible, hopefully, within the week.
Much work is being done on this to
resolve the concerns of those who have
some of the most knowledge, and that
is members of our Hispanic Caucus who
live on the border, who interface on the
border and who see, every day, the con-
sequences of what is happening. They
want to make sure that, yes, there is
humanitarian assistance and people are
treated humanely, safely, and with re-
spect. But they don’t want that money
used to treat other people who are in
this country in an arbitrary and capri-
cious way.
So I want to join the gentleman, Mr.
Speaker, and assure him that I share
his concern. We are urging everybody
to work as hard as they possibly can to
get to an agreement, and I am hopeful
that we can do that in the very, very
near future. I am told leaving here
without doing that would not be ac-
ceptable.
Mr. SCALISE. Reclaiming my time,
Mr. Speaker, I know when we talk
about the broader immigration prob-
lem, President Trump has been very
clear that he wants to work with Con-
gress to solve the problem, the bigger
problem, not just a wall, but full bor-
der security and closing those loop-
holes.
In fact, Mexican officials have even
pointed out that America’s broken asy-
lum law is one of the biggest magnets
that is drawing people through their
southern border, up to our southern
border, and into our country. They
even acknowledge it. We need to fix
that. We need to work together as a
Congress to fix that problem.
President Trump offered to solve the
DACA problem. He still hasn’t found a
willing partner. We need to keep work-
ing at that.
We have just had testimony in a com-
mittee earlier this week where it was
pointed out that, as people come over,
unfortunately, they abuse children
over and over again because young
children are a ticket into the country
much quicker than other illegal means,
and so they abuse these children over
and over again. It is one of the many
reasons why we need to solve that
problem.
But when they get that asylum tick-
et, then they are sent into the interior
of the country and are told to come
back and see us in years, sometimes,
for their court date. Ninety percent of
those people who get that court date
don’t show up. We don’t know where
they are. That is how broken the asy-
lum law is. We need to fix that.
Again, that is not this request. We
can have that debate another day. We
need to have that debate another day.
When my friend’s party was in the
majority last time, when Barack
Obama took office and when Speaker
PELOSI was first Speaker and there was
a supermajority in the Senate on the
Democratic side, there was never an at-
tempt to bring a bill through Congress
to solve the immigration problem. I
would like to see us come together and
do that. We need to do it. But today,
we need to solve the immediate crisis.
We will have that broader debate later.
Hopefully, by next week we can get
that done.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman
for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I want to place in his-
torical context, again, this House

passed a DREAM Act, and we sent it to
the Senate and the Senate didn’t pass
it. So this House, when we were in the
majority, did do that, but we couldn’t
get 60 votes in the Senate. We know
that problem. It so happens we were in
the majority, but we couldn’t get 60
votes for that at that point in time.
We could go on a long time about
pointing fingers at who has done what
and when, but the fact of the matter is
we have some people in real distress.
We have some Federal employees who
have a responsibility who are being
greatly challenged. We need to address
that, and I am urging that we do that
as quickly as we possibly can.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, hope-
fully, we can continue that work
through the weekend and get that done
next week. I know there is other work
the House is getting ready to take up

On one final note, as we approach Fa-
ther’s Day on Sunday, I would also like
to wish the gentleman from Maryland
a happy birthday tomorrow. So, hope-
fully, the gentleman has some fun
events planned this weekend, maybe go
eat some Maryland crabs. If my friend
is really lucky, we will give him some
gulf crabs from the Gulf of Mexico. I
won’t sing ‘‘Happy Birthday’’ to the
gentleman.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. HOYER. We are about to deliver
a chit, if you will, for a dinner for four
at one of the famous crab houses here
in Washington as the result of Louisi-
ana’s not treating the University of
Maryland nearly as thoughtfully as
they could have, and I lost that bet.
But I appreciate my friend’s wish for a
happy birthday.
God has been very good to me, and I
am looking forward to celebrating that
birthday. My daughters were a little
premature. We celebrated it last Satur-
day, too, so we are going to have a
number of celebrations on this birth-
day, and then hopefully everybody will
forget it, including me.
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I will be
happy to give the gentleman a review
of the restaurant. I am sure it will be
really good.
I wish the gentleman well, and I wish
all fathers a happy Father’s Day this
weekend.
I look forward to seeing the gen-
tleman back in a few days, and with
that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the bal-

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentlewoman
from New York (Mrs. LOWEY) and the
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. ROG-
ERS) each will control 10 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York.
b 1415
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, this en
bloc includes amendments from Rep-
resentatives Cohen, Foster, Connolly,
Cicilline, Boyle, Panetta,
Krishnamoorthi, Espaillat, Cox,
Cunningham, Spanberger, Levin, and
Murphy.
The amendment includes a number of
good ideas that were not included in
the original bill. I support this amend-
ment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the
gentleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN),
a member of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair, I
rise in support of this en bloc package
that includes my amendment to pro-
hibit the use of funds in this act for as-
sistance to the Forces Armees d’Haiti,
or the Haitian Armed Forces, the
FAd’H.
I worked in Haiti as an investigator
for Human Rights Watch in 1992, not
long after Haitian soldiers led a coup
against Haiti’s first democratically-
elected President and not long before
the military was implicated in the
massacre of his supporters in the town
of Raboteau.
Now, the Haitian government has re-
vived the armed forces and empowered
some of the same people who played a
part in those horrors of the 1990s to
lead them.
We cannot let a single dollar of U.S.
taxpayer funds go to the FAd’H. The
Haitian people must know that we
have not forgotten the horrors of their
past and we are committed to working
with them for a better future.
I thank Congresswoman LEE, Con-
gresswoman WATERS, Congressman
ENGEL, and Congressman SIRES for co-
sponsoring this amendment, and I also
thank Chairwoman LOWEY for working
with me on this and for her hard work
on this bill.
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise in opposition to the amend-
ment.
This en bloc amendment contains
several measures that could have en-
joyed broad support. Unfortunately, it
also includes several amendments that
some on our side are unable to accept.
This includes an amendment offered
by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.
COHEN) relating to the Trump organiza-
tion. We regard that amendment as a
partisan stunt that would jeopardize
the safety and security of State De-
partment personnel and foreign dig-
nitaries.
The proposed funding prohibition
would have serious consequences for
the Department of State Diplomatic
Security Service. The mission of Diplo-
matic Security is to protect the people,
places, and vital information that
allow the United States to be a leader
in world events.
That includes protecting the personal
security of the Secretary of State when
he is tasked by the President with at-
tending summits at one of the prop-
erties listed in the amendment.
The President, not the Secretary of
State, selects travel locations. The
Diplomatic Security is also charged
with protecting foreign dignitaries and
heads of State when they are in the
U.S. on official business. They must do
this no matter where they might stay.
The restrictions in the amendment
would make these officials, American
and foreign, less safe.
Another amendment, offered by the
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.
CICILLINE), would prohibit funding for a
new Commission on Unalienable
Rights.
The State Department recently an-
nounced its intent to stand up this
commission, which will regularly pro-
vide the Secretary with advice on
human rights matters. The State De-
partment recently announced that this
would take place.
At a time in which these crises are
widespread, I can think of no reason
why we shouldn’t bring new voices into
the discussion. This is especially so
considering the commission’s focus on
unalienable rights, the founding prin-
ciple on which our country was built.
Finally, I also have concerns about
the inclusion of the amendment offered
by the gentleman from California (Mr.
COX). The programs referenced in the
amendment are either concluding or
are not supported with U.S. assistance.
For these reasons, Mr. Chairman, I
urge my colleagues to oppose the
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COHEN), a senior member of
the Judiciary Committee.
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chair, I am speaking
in favor of the amendment we have
that would prohibit the use of funds at
businesses owned by President Trump.
Mr. RASKIN joins me in these amend-
ments.
President Trump’s refusal to divest
himself of his many businesses raises
serious questions about compliance
with the domestic Emoluments Clause,
which protects against Presidential
corruption.
By prohibiting the use of Federal
funds at businesses owned, in whole or
in part, by President Trump, we will be
sending a strong message to the Amer-
ican people that we will not allow this
or any other President to use his high
office for personal enrichment.
The fact is, when we stay at his ho-
tels and his properties, he makes
money. Nobody is supposed to make
money from the Presidency, directly or
indirectly, and they are supposed to re-
port these possibilities to the Congress,
so we have knowledge.
That has not been done. We need no-
tice, we need knowledge, and we need
prohibition.
I urge passage of this amendment to
protect the American taxpayer.
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chair-
man, I reserve the balance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Illinois
(Mr. FOSTER) a member of the Finan-
cial Services Committee.
Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chair, I thank the
chairwoman for yielding.
My amendment will direct the State
Department to use $10 million from the
NADR account to take advantage of
the opportunity to advance U.S. diplo-
matic goals in the Middle East through
scientific engagement with a contribu-
tion to the SESAME Project.
SESAME, the Synchrotron-light for
Experimental Science and Application
in the Middle East, is a major science
facility in Jordan.
About an hour drive from Amman
and an hour drive from Jerusalem, it is
a cooperative venture by scientists and
governments throughout the region,
including Israel, Iran, and everyone in
between.
Science is a universal language that
can cross barriers and build bridges, if
we let it. As a high-energy particle
physicist who spent my career working
with international teams of scientists,
I saw firsthand that even when a coun-
try’s politicians cannot get along,
often its scientists can.
This U.S. support will strengthen the
SESAME Project and encourage sci-
entific collaboration among all of the
countries in the Mideast.
I urge my colleagues to join me and
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this en bloc package.
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chair,
I continue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Rhode
Island (Mr. CICILLINE), a senior member
of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
to support the en bloc amendment
which includes my amendment to pre-
vent funding for the proposed Commis-
sion on Unalienable Rights at the De-
partment of State which has been pro-
posed by Secretary Pompeo in order to
promote natural law and natural
rights.
Now, I would wholeheartedly support
a concerted focus on human rights by
this administration.
Instead of any really coordinated
human rights policy, this President
and the Secretary of State have cozied
up to dictators and made excuses for
flagrant human rights violations, even
by some of our supposed allies.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4678 June 13, 2019
No, unfortunately, it is clear that
this proposed commission is an at-
tempt by the administration to co-opt
American policy on human rights to
give preference to an ideology that has
been associated with discrimination
against marginalized communities, in-
cluding the LGBT community, women,
and religious minorities.
The State Department already has an
entire bureau—the Bureau of Democ-
racy, Human Rights, and Labor—dedi-
cated to defending human rights, yet
the Secretary is proposing to bypass
the official structure of the diplomatic
corps to create an ideologically moti-
vated commission, without congres-
sional approval or oversight, to pro-
mote natural rights based on natural
law.
These terms have no legal meaning
and have deep associations with
homophobic and discriminatory move-
ments.
There should be no place for this at
our Department of State, which should
be a leading voice in the protection and
promotion of human rights for all.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support the en bloc amendment, and I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chair,
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Ms. SPANBERGER), a member of
the Foreign Affairs Committee.
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Chair, I
thank the chairwoman for including
my amendment in this en bloc.
As a co-chair of the New Democrat
Coalition’s National Security Task
Force and as a member of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, I rise to
express my serious concern over the
continued high-level vacancies across
the State Department.
U.S. Foreign Service officers work to
promote U.S. interests, values, and
economic interests abroad, and these
dedicated public servants keep Amer-
ican families safe.
But their mission could be jeopard-
ized by persistent vacancies in the For-
eign Service and senior leadership posi-
tions.
According to a report from the non-
partisan Government Accountability
Office, 13 percent of Foreign Service
positions were vacant as of March 2018.
At a time when we are engaged in
constant competition with powerful ad-
versaries, our servicemembers remain
engaged in seemingly endless conflicts,
and we face the threat of terrorism,
these staffing shortages are deeply con-
cerning.
Our transfer amendment urges the
State Department to make every effort
to fill critical positions and encourages
the GAO to expand its study to con-
sider the impact of vacancies in career
and political-appointed positions on
U.S. foreign policy, diplomacy, aid, and
national security priorities.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Illinois
(Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI), a member of
the House Intelligence Committee.
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Chair, I
rise today in support of H.R. 2740 and
its amendments.
The Overseas Private Investment
Corporation is a self-sustaining govern-
ment agency that helps American busi-
nesses invest in emerging markets.
This October, it will become the U.S.
International Development Finance
Corporation, the DFC, with increased
capabilities to invest and drive eco-
nomic growth around the developing
world.
Critically, the DFC will be able to
compete with China on a global stage,
strengthening our relationship with
nations around the world.
However, these agencies do not have
specific national security processes or
reviews in place. They are entirely de-
pendent on Federal standards.
My bipartisan amendment, which I
introduced with Republican Congress-
man CHRIS STEWART, prohibits any
agency from violating the Export Con-
trols Act, which lays out what goods,
items, and knowledge can be exported.
This amendment would ensure that
an American business investing funds
and technology in foreign ventures are
not inadvertently exporting equipment
that is, for example, Huawei supported.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentleman has expired.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield the
gentleman from Illinois an additional 1
minute.
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. It is essen-
tial that all government agencies, par-
ticularly in times of transition and
growth, are fully compliant with na-
tional security requirements.
I strongly urge my colleagues to sup-
port this amendment.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chair,
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Chair, my amendment designates $1.5
million for the International Fund for Ireland in
the Economic Support Fund account of the
Fiscal Year 2020 State, Foreign Operations
Appropriations Act.
The International Fund for Ireland is an
independent organization that supports eco-
nomic regeneration and social development
projects in areas most affected by the dec-
ades of violence in Northern Ireland. Since its
inception in 1986, IFI’s projects have made
vital contributions to improving the physical
and economic infrastructure in some of the
area’s most vulnerable communities.
My amendment increases funding for IFI be-
cause their work is more relevant now than it
has ever been in recent years. Brexit will have
significant consequences for the island of Ire-
land. The border between Northern Ireland
and Ireland is in danger of, once again, be-
coming a significant barrier, physically and
psychologically, to harmonious relationships
that have been delicately fostered over the
past few decades.
Additionally, the shared political arrange-
ment established by the Good Friday Agree-
ment has stalled. Currently, there is no power-
sharing government in Northern Ireland. The
absence of shared political leadership has af-
fected reconciliation and the delivery of other
benefits that should be flowing form the Good
Friday Agreement.
The Good Friday Agreement just was the
start of the creation of peace and reconcili-
ation on the island of lreland, not the end. Bro-
kered by U.S. Special Envoy George Mitchell,
the agreement was one of our country’s great
foreign policy achievements of the 20th cen-
tury. Successive U.S. Administrations and
many Members of Congress have actively
supported the Northern Ireland peace process
and the International Fund for Ireland.
Increasing IFI’s funding would put more
money towards the Fund’s three main pro-
grams: the Peace Impact Program, the Per-
sonal Youth Development Program and the
Peace Walls Program that bring critical
changes to deprived areas and reduce fear in
communities. An increase in funding will also
go towards building civic voices along and
across the border and towards supporting the
field of peace builders on the island.
Over the years, the United States has con-
sistently reaffirmed its commitment to help cre-
ate a strong and peaceful society in Northern
Ireland, and our continued involvement is im-
portant for maintaining that peace.
Peace is not a given. It must be constantly
upheld and cannot be taken for granted. Right
now, is a critical time for my fellow Members
of Congress to continue their support for
peace throughout the island by increasing
funding to the International Fund for Ireland.
I thank Chairwoman LOWEY for working with
me on my amendment and urge my col-
leagues to support it.
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chair, I rise today in
support of this en bloc package of amend-
ments to H.R. 2740, which includes my simple
amendment that would prohibit funding for
International Military Education and Training
(IMET) for Saudi Arabia—restating a prohibi-
tion included in the FY 2019 funding bill.
As its name suggests, IMET assistance pro-
vides grants to foreign military personnel to
access training and education at U.S. military
facilities.
But this program is also a portal to a major
discount on military training that a foreign
country purchases from the United States.
Traditionally, Saudi Arabia had received a
nominal $10,000 in IMET assistance annu-
ally—but that funding unlocked a discount for
Riyadh, enabling the Kingdom to save up to
$30 million per year on its purchase of de-
fense services.
In the wake of Jamal Khashoggi’s murder,
rising civilian casualties in Yemen, and in-
creasing oppression of political dissent inside
and outside Saudi Arabia, provision of IMET
assistance—and the significant savings it
unlocks—to Riyadh is no longer tenable.
The United States must take stock of our
strategic interests and reexamine our relation-
ship with Saudi Arabia to ensure that U.S. pol-
icy is rooted in American values, particularly
respect for human rights.
I urge my colleagues to support my amend-
ment to this bill and ensure that we hold Saudi
Arabia accountable for its gross violations of
human rights.
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Chair, I rise today
in support of my bipartisan amendment, which
would commit additional resources towards
USAID’s efforts to combat illegal, under-
reported, and unregulated fishing internation-
ally.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4679
June 13, 2019
This is particularly important to the
Lowcountry, which has a vibrant fishing indus-
try that goes out of its way to safeguard our
marine resources. I want to make sure that
they can compete in a fair market, and that
their work for the environment is not under-
mined by bad actors.
American fisheries are some of the best
managed in the world. But our fishermen who
work hard and play by the rules are constantly
undercut by low-cost imports caught by un-
scrupulous means. In fact, by some estimates,
commercial fishermen in the United States
could see up to a 20 percent raise were it not
for illegally-caught, imported fish. This is not
only due to the volume of illegal imports, it is
also because these illegal products come to
market without meeting the safety, labor, and
environmental standards that American fisher-
men abide by.
It goes without saying that allowing this
practice to continue unchecked will have a dis-
astrous effect on marine ecosystems and en-
courage further crimes on the high seas. As a
Member of the House Natural Resources
Committee, I am committed to protecting both
the environment and our fishermen.
My amendment would contribute to efforts
to tackle this problem before it reaches our
shores. By helping partner nations build the
capacity to police their own waters, we will
stop illegal fishing at its source. My amend-
ment supports an American foreign policy that
is both good for the environment and good for
our fishermen. I urge all of my colleagues, on
both sides of the aisle, to vote to support the
environment and the American fishing indus-
try.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendments en bloc offered by
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.
LOWEY).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. ROY. Mr. Chair, I demand a re-

York will be postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 87 OFFERED BY MR. GROTHMAN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 87 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division D (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll. Each amount made available by
this division (other than an amount required
to be made available by a provision of law) is
hereby reduced by 2.1 percent.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentleman
from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Wisconsin.
b 1430
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I rise today in support of my amend-
ment that would reduce the overall
funding provided under Division D of
State and Foreign Operations by 2.1
percent.
Every year, the House lays out a
blueprint for spending that is com-
prised of 12 separate bills. It seems
many in this body have chosen to con-
tinue Washington’s pattern of out-of-
control spending with increases in
every bill, some bills going up as much
as 15 percent.
This is why Washington is doing ex-
actly what is expected, spending too
much money overall while not funding
critically important programs like bor-
der security.
Given that last year we borrowed
nearly $1 trillion, or 20 percent of total
spending, this partisan 4.1 percent
spending increase, an additional $2.2
billion, included in the State and For-
eign Operations division of H.R. 2740, as
proposed by House Democrats, puts
America even further in debt, which is
completely irresponsible.
It is kind of strange, if you think
about it. If you were going to ask
somebody for more money, would you
ask the U.S. Government?
My amendment would seek to rein in
this out-of-control government spend-
ing by capping growth in the State and
Foreign Operations division.
I encourage my colleagues to return
to responsible spending and support
this amendment.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I claim time
in opposition to the gentleman’s
amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from New York is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, Ranking
Member ROGERS and I have worked
hard to craft a bill that provides the
necessary tools to the Secretary of
State and the USAID Administrator to
advance United States foreign policy.
The bill also upholds many bipartisan
positions and congressional interests.
I have long opposed amendments that
indiscriminately apply an across-the-
board cut to the carefully thought-out
funding recommendations in each ap-
propriations bill. Such amendments
make no provision for protecting high-
priority programs and activities, such
as security assistance for Israel, which
would be cut by $66 million; global
health programs, which would be cut
by $184 million, including $118 million
less for HIV/AIDS activities; humani-
tarian assistance, which would be cut
by $158 million; and funding to protect
our diplomats and development per-
sonnel and their facilities, which would
be cut by $120 million.
Cuts would also impact support for
other key allies, such as Jordan,
Egypt, Ukraine, Colombia, and coun-
tries in Eastern Europe battling Rus-
sian aggression and disinformation.
Mr. Chair, Congress must strengthen,
not cut, these civilian agencies so that
they can respond to foreign policy cri-
ses and protect our economic interests
abroad.
I strongly urge my colleagues to op-
pose this amendment.
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Will the
gentlewoman yield?
Mrs. LOWEY. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Kentucky.
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chair,
I rise in opposition to the gentleman’s
amendment as well.
Across-the-board cuts are the cow-
ard’s way out of making hard deci-
sions. The committee has expertise on
the spending policies of the country,
and we apply that wisdom, experience,
and research on which agencies to fund
and which ones we should not.
The wise selection of spending prior-
ities is what the appropriations process
is all about. An across-the-board cut
cuts good programs as well as perhaps
some that should be cut.
Nevertheless, the judgment of the
Congress should be exercised on the ex-
penditures that we make across the
government, not a slash-and-burn 2
percent cut or what have you.
This amendment would cut every-
thing across the board, and that in-
cludes the $3.3 billion in foreign mili-
tary financing for Israel. Now is not
the time to cut $69 million in essential
security assistance for our ally, Israel.
I urge Members to oppose this
amendment.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I will
just make one point. We are borrowing.
We have dropped a little bit below
about 20 percent of our budget right
now. I think most people on the Appro-
priations Committee would say every-
thing is essential.
I will make one point, among several,
on the programs that were criticized.
We are going to cut 2.2 percent of glob-
al health programs. In my district, it is
more and more common for people to
have $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 deductibles
on their health insurance policies. Fre-
quently, they are paying $15,000 or
$20,000 for those policies, to boot.
We are crying the blues that maybe
we can’t afford a 2 percent cut in our
global health programs. I think it is bi-
zarre that I am going to have to go
back home—and I will probably lose
this fight—and tell people that next
year, their health insurance premiums
may go up 10 or 11 percent, but we
can’t cut global health programs by 2
percent. It is just absurd.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I strongly
urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the gentleman’s
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr.
GROTHMAN).
The question was taken; and the Act-

Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, this en bloc
includes amendments from Representa-
tive KILDEE and Representative SHER-
MAN. The amendment includes a num-
ber of good ideas that were not in-
cluded in the original bill.
I support this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chair,
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield 3
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. SHERMAN), a senior member
of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Chair, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding and for
including my amendment, along with
one other amendment, in this en bloc.
My amendment would transfer
$500,000 from the State Department’s
capital investments fund and put it in
the U.S. Agency for Global Media fund.
This extra money would allow the
USAGM to begin the process of having
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty
broadcast in the Sindhi language in
Pakistan.
There is, perhaps, nowhere in the
world where it is more important for
the United States to battle extremism
and to reach out with a message of de-
mocracy and the message of the Amer-
ican people than Pakistan.
Pakistan is a nuclear-armed state,
the only nuclear-armed state that has
ever experienced a military coup, and
is a nuclear-armed state with a signifi-
cant problem with terrorism.
Today, the USAGM broadcasts in the
Urdu language of Pakistan, which is
the primary language of only 8 percent
of the Pakistani population. It does not
have the funds to broadcast in the
Sindhi language, which would reach 40
million people.
Mr. Chair, we had hearings in the
subcommittee that I chair, the Sub-
committee on Asia, where we focused
on this issue. Just today, the relevant
Assistant Secretary of State for South
Asia talked about how important it
was for us to reach out to the people of
Sindh, to southern Pakistan, in the
language that the people actually
speak in their daily lives.
Accordingly, I offer this amendment,
which would provide expanded broad-
casting by the entity known as Radio
Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Of course,
Pakistan is not in Europe, but it is
reached by Radio Liberty.
In 2015, the State Department began
some efforts to reach out in the Sindhi
language with a website and with press
releases. Now, we have to take it to the
point of radio broadcasting.
Since 2001, the United States has in-
vested $30 billion in economic security
and humanitarian assistance for Paki-
stan. This amendment deals with only
$500,000 to be invested in winning the
hearts and minds of the Sindhi people.
I will point out that while this
amendment would provide $500,000 for
this purpose, it is my hope that, as we
go through the legislative process, we
can increase that amount to $1.5 mil-
lion, which is the estimate that the
Broadcasting Board of Governors has
given me for what it would cost to have
a year-round, mostly close to 24-hour
Sindhi language service.
I know that amount seems low, but
keep in mind that they already have
most of the content since they are al-
ready doing the journalism necessary
to do stories about Pakistan in the
Urdu language. This would give them a
chance to broadcast that same content
and some other content in the Sindhi
language.

The Acting CHAIR (Mr. VAN DREW).
The time of the gentleman has expired.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield an
additional 1 minute to the gentleman.
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Chair, I will sim-
ply say that looking at the fact that
we have invested $30 billion in our rela-
tionship with Pakistan, I cannot think
of a better investment than for us to
provide $500,000, and, I hope, as we go
through the legislative process, $1.5
million in reaching out to those who
speak the Sindhi language, some 40
million people.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chair,

Karabakh. Twenty thousand people
were killed and hundreds of thousands
more were displaced before the conflict
froze.
While an agreed upon ceasefire has
been held for over 2 decades, the lack of
a formal end to the war has left the Ar-
menian people of Nagorno-Karabakh
isolated.
Un-detonated mines and cluster
bombs from the conflict remain in the
region. As a result, Karabakh has one
of the world’s highest civilian casualty
rates from land mines and the explo-
sive remnants of war.
According to the HALO Trust, there
have been nearly 400 civilian casualties
from mines and unexploded ordnance in
Karabakh over the last 2 decades, and a
quarter of those land mine victims
have been children.
In 2013, a needs assessment estimated
that the HALO Trust’s interventions in
Karabakh have benefited over 80 per-
cent of the region’s population.
Mr. Chair, families and children
shouldn’t have to live in fear of dying
due to a land mine accident. That is
why I urge my colleagues in the House
of Representatives to support my
amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of

House Resolution 431, the gentleman

a Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from North Carolina.
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Chair, less than 10
days ago, this body missed a perfect op-
portunity. You see, natural disasters
are unpredictable, but you know what
isn’t? Congress failing to do their job
and prepare for them.
For too long Washington has gov-
erned by crisis and shifted its responsi-
bility to adequately care for those in
need, opting instead to saddle our chil-
dren and grandchildren with an impos-
sible debt.
Then days ago, this body wanted to
spend more than $19 billion with no
consideration of how to pay for it. Was
it for a worthy cause? Absolutely. Of
course. I would hope that every dollar
appropriated by Congress is for a wor-
thy cause. But as then-Representative
MIKE PENCE said in 2005, following the
devastation of Hurricane Katrina, does
Congress have a duty to ensure that a
catastrophe of nature does not become
a catastrophe of debt?
Congress should pay for these emer-
gency packages by either cutting
spending in other areas that are less of
a priority or responsibly budgeting for
them ahead of time.
Disaster aid shouldn’t be added to
the debt. That is akin to going to the
emergency room after an injury, put-
ting the charges on a credit card, and
then pretending that credit card bill is
never going to arrive.
The bottom line is this, that even
during an emergency, Washington
needs to pay its bills.
My amendment is relatively simple,
Mr. Chair. My amendment would be a
1-year reallocation of the Department
of State and USAID’s bilateral eco-
nomic assistance and independent
agency funds to cover the disaster re-
covery.
Let me explain. Combined, these ac-
counts amount to more than $23.9 bil-
lion and would fully cover the disaster
recovery, including the $5.87 billion in
debt servicing costs of the borrowed
funds, all while prioritizing America’s
recovery and resiliency.
America is still the most philan-
thropic country in the world and would
continue to be.
Mr. Chair, this amendment recog-
nizes our dire fiscal health by reducing
foreign aid during these times and
prioritizing Americans and American
recovery efforts first.
As the President and this administra-
tion have said on multiple occasions,
we must prioritize our domestic needs
first and put the American citizens at
the front of the line, especially during
these times of disaster relief and espe-
cially since we are the ones that will
foot the bill.
With these spending offsets, I believe
we can show the American people we
are serious about their recovery from
disasters in a fiscally responsible man-
ner that will not burden our future
generations with debt and despair.
Finally, we can help our neighbors
and serve the Americans impacted by
natural disasters by prioritizing our
families before foreign interests.
Congress should take this oppor-
tunity to put America first and lead re-
sponsibly.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I rise in
strong opposition to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from New York is recognized for 5 min-

Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, Ranking
Member ROGERS and I have worked

Smart use of global health, humani-

builds greater global stability, and pro-
motes American values.

How are these cuts in our national
interest?
Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the
gentleman’s amendment, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Chair, my amend-
ment is simple. It is about prioritizing
domestic needs. It is about prioritizing
these families that have suffering. It is
about prioritizing these children who
are suffering.
We need to be responsible.
Mr. Chair, I thank the chairwoman
and the ranking member for their hard
work in the appropriations process, but
nowhere is this spending disaster relief
ever talked about. It is time that we do
so.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, our national
security is strongest when develop-
ment, diplomacy, and defense are
equally prioritized.
This amendment undermines United
States leadership and diminishes our
engagement in the world.
Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to oppose this amendment, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tleman from North Carolina (Mr.
WALKER).
The question was taken; and the Act-

AMENDMENT NO. 91 OFFERED BY MR. PALMER
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 91 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 599, strike line 3 and all that follows
through line 17 (and redesignate accord-
ingly).
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentleman
from Alabama (Mr. PALMER) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Alabama.
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Chairman, my
amendment would strike the section
that allows payments to go towards
the Paris climate agreement. Most im-
portantly, it would allow President
Trump to follow through on his plan to
withdraw from the agreement.
Just a few months ago, it was re-
ported that the U.S. economy exceeded
analysts’ predictions and grew at over
3 percent in the first quarter of this
year.
In October of last year, unemploy-
ment had a mere 50-year low, and
wages are going up. In fact, the Bureau
of Labor Statistics reported there are
7.4 million jobs available.
Mr. Chair, now those on the other
side of the aisle want to put at risk
that growth and enforce policies that
will do nothing to stop climate change.
b 1500
What would staying in the agreement
lead to?
The Heritage Foundation has mod-
eled the policies that would be required
to meet the Obama administration’s
Paris commitments and found that by
2035 there would be an overall loss of
nearly 400,000 jobs, half of which would
be in manufacturing, an average total
income lost of more than $20,000 for a
family of four, an aggregate GDP loss
of over $2.5 trillion, and an increase in
household electricity expenditures be-
tween 13 percent and 20 percent.
My amendment would allow the
United States to stay out of this unre-
alistic and overbearing agreement. I
urge the Members to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this
amendment.
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Will the
gentleman yield?
Mr. PALMER. I yield to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chair-
man, I thank the gentleman for yield-
ing. I rise in support of his amendment.
The Paris Agreement is an unwork-
able, unrealistic policy solution to cli-
mate change. If implemented, as the
gentleman has said, the Paris accord
could cost as many as 2.7 million
American jobs by 2025 and imposes no
meaningful obligations on the world’s
leading polluters like China and India.
I can’t condone dedicating precious
Federal funds to a half-baked solution.
This amendment would strike funding
provided for implementing that agree-
ment, as well as language that at-
tempts to prevent President Trump
from withdrawing.
I urge Members to support the gen-
tleman’s amendment, and I thank him
for yielding.
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Chair, I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I rise in op-
position to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from New York is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Our global partners are critical in
combating climate change, and the
Paris Agreement is a sign of the global
commitment from these countries to
fight this scourge together.
In addition, climate change is a seri-
ous national security threat, and we
need to treat it as such by seeking al-
lies, including multilateral institu-
tions to address it with urgency.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. GRAVES), the ranking mem-
ber on the Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis.
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr.
Chairman, I want to thank the gen-
tleman from Alabama for yielding. I
want to thank him for bringing this
amendment up.
Mr. Chairman, it is really important
to make sure we understand what we
are talking about here. The Paris ac-
cord was engaged in for the purpose of
benefiting the global environment, for
benefiting the global environment and
for reducing emissions, yet what has
happened under the agreement with
the pledges that the nations have made
is that the United States, over the last
several years, has actually reduced our
emissions by nearly a billion tons.
China has actually increased theirs by
4 billion tons.
This agreement is so disparate it
doesn’t make sense. The President was
right to withdraw.
But to distinguish, we can stay fo-
cused on the targets, the pledges, but
we should not codify, memorialize,
agree, or in anyway comply with this
disparate approach where China can
continue polluting the environment.
Mr. Chairman, this is similar to a
scenario where I get together with a
group of friends and I say, hey, we are
going to have a savings club, and we
are all going to get together, and I am
going put money into it, and they are
going come and take money out. That
is not a savings club. That is what is
happening.
This is not benefiting the environ-
ment. The United States should not
participate, codify, or support this sce-
nario where China is out there more
than increasing by the emissions re-
ductions that the United States is
achieving.
We have had the greatest emissions
reductions in the world, greater than
the next 11 countries combined, and we
have done it without this agreement.
I urge adoption of the amendment.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. ROUDA).
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Chair, when are my
colleagues on the other side of the aisle
going to give up this toddler argument
that we should not take action to ad-
dress the number one issue facing hu-
mankind, and that is climate change?
The fact that other countries are not
moving as fast as we are is no reason
for us to give up the mantle of leader-
ship and allow the United States of
America to be the only country on the
face of the Earth not a member of the
Paris climate accord.
It is time for us to be on the right
side of history, and I would implore the
Members on the other side of the aisle
to recognize this is their time to do the
right thing, not just for us, but for our
children, our grandchildren, and future
generations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4683
June 13, 2019
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Chair, I would like
to point out that the United States has
led the world in reducing carbon emis-
sions, and I would also like to point
out that even former Secretary of
State John Kerry, in 2015, stated, if we
somehow eliminated all domestic
greenhouse gas emissions—guess
what—it still wouldn’t be enough to
offset the carbon pollution coming
from the rest of the world.
I would also like to point out that, in
a hearing before the Select Committee
on the Climate Crisis, I asked the Dem-
ocrat witnesses, including an author
and editor of the International Panel
on Climate Change, if the United
States completely eliminated all of its
carbon emissions, would it stop climate
change, and their answer was it would
not.
We have led the world in reducing
carbon emissions without harming our
economy, and it makes no sense sci-
entifically or from an engineering per-
spective to engage in destroying our
own economy when the rest of the
world and, particularly, China and
other emerging economies are not
doing their part to reduce their carbon
emissions.
I want to emphasize the fact that
eliminating our carbon emissions will
not stop climate change. Sound
science, technology, and sound engi-
neering will do more to mitigate and
adapt than anything else you can do.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, the best and
the brightest among us—our military,
our business leaders, our scientists—all
agree that climate change is real and is
a serious threat. We are already experi-
encing its harmful effects which will
continue if we do not act alongside our
multilateral partners. If we want to
prepare our country to better mitigate
and manage climate change, then I
urge my colleagues to oppose this
amendment.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.

tleman from Alabama (Mr. PALMER).

AMENDMENT NO. 94 OFFERED BY MR. ARRINGTON
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 94 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Chair, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division D (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll. None of the funds made available
by this Act may be used for contributions to
the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Texas.
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Chairman, I
rise today to offer an amendment to
H.R. 2740 that would prevent funds
from being used to contribute to the
United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change.
Mr. Chairman, at the heart of Amer-
ica’s economic prosperity and
unrivaled security is an abundant, af-
fordable supply of domestic energy, and
the lion’s share of that, 90 percent, is
fossil energy. The hardworking energy
producers of west Texas and the folks
in my district are leading the way.
In the Permian Basin of west Texas,
we went from producing a million bar-
rels of oil a day to 4 million a day, soon
to be 8 million in just 3 or 4 years,
making it the most active oil and gas
producing region in the world.
The blessings of these natural re-
sources have given us an overwhelming
advantage for economic prosperity as
well as national security. To ensure we
continue these advantages for the next
generation, I offer this amendment
that would prevent U.S. taxpayer dol-
lars from going to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate
Change, a costly, ineffective, and irre-
sponsible program that has produced
the likes of the Paris climate accord.
The climate activists’ agenda, Mr.
Chairman, and extreme ideological
views promoted by the Framework
Convention embrace the view that the
only means to successfully reduce car-
bon emissions is to eliminate conven-
tional fuels, which, by the way, power
our Nation’s economy, again, at 90 per-
cent.
This framework is flawed in its as-
sumptions, fraught with political bias,
hostile towards our main source of en-
ergy, and amounts to a jobs program
for ideological bureaucrats, and I op-
pose it and so do the people of west
Texas and most of the people in this
country.
And did I mention that we spend bil-
lions of dollars to subsidize the biggest
polluters to comply with the mandates
from this framework and completely
transition away from conventional en-
ergy sources?
America would pay out of the nose to
fuel their vehicles and heat their
homes. It would hurt our poor people
more than anyone else.
The Paris accord is the most recent
product and egregious example of this
framework. At best, the Paris Agree-
ment is political window dressing. At
worst, it is a tax on middle- and work-
ing-class families, with a price tag
that, in just 5 years, would amount to
$250 billion in costs to our economy
and 2.7 million jobs. Meanwhile, it
would have forced us to subsidize the
world’s biggest polluters, like India,
and it would give a pass to hostile pow-
ers like Russia and China for years.
I believe we have an environmental
stewardship responsibility to our cre-
ator and to our children, but we must
be responsible to balance those stew-
ardship responsibilities with our eco-
nomic and national security interests.
Here is the irony, Mr. Chairman. The
irony is that America is already lead-
ing the way for a cleaner environment,
and we are leading by example, not by
words, by flowery words, fancy phrases,
big speeches, fear-mongering. We are
leading by example.
And we are doing this not through
Big Government solutions, one-size-
fits-all, top-down mandates. We are
doing it through innovation and tech-
nology development in partnership
with industry, and the results are re-
markable and measurable.
Greenhouse gases are down by 14 per-
cent since ‘05, the rest of the world up
20 percent; carbon emissions down 20
percent, the rest of the world up; meth-
ane gas cut in half. Since 1970, all the
six key pollutants in the Clean Air Act,
down 73 percent.
And this President is the only one
who has put in a legally sound green-
house gas emissions standard that will
reduce the coal power plants’ emissions
by 34 percent of the levels they were at
in 2005.
That is progress. Those are real re-
sults.
It is reckless and naive to bind tax-
payers to international agreements
that compromise our freedom and our
economic security and virtually do
nothing to impact the environment. In-
stead, we should put forth solutions
that encourage the continued develop-
ment of all energy sources while set-
ting high but reasonable standards for
environmental quality in human
health, and achieve those objectives
not in hostility to the energy source
that has blessed us with all the things
that I have mentioned and not through
abuse of Presidential powers, but in
partnership with States and other im-
portant stakeholders.
I urge my colleagues to support this
very important amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

position to the amendment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4684 June 13, 2019
The United States has been a party
to the UNFCCC since 1992, thanks in
large part to the leadership of the
George H.W. Bush administration.
As chairwoman of the Appropriations
Committee, I will not support efforts
that will jeopardize our treaty-based
obligations.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
oppose this amendment.
Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. ROUDA).
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Chair, the gen-
tleman knows the Paris climate accord
is voluntary, so he does not save one
job by declining to follow the protocol
that we previously agreed on.
I do agree that there are economic
opportunities that we can embrace,
new technologies. I would love to see
us work across the aisle to do just that.
As a former Republican, I used to be
in that party because of its environ-
mental stewardship, because it be-
lieved that capitalism could help solve
these problems. I still believe it as a
Democrat on this side of the aisle, and
I am hopeful that we can work to-
gether.
For example, for every $1 that we
provide in economic incentives for re-
newable energies, we have provided $80
to the fossil fuel industry. Clearly, if
we had parity, we would see a much
faster adoption of clean energies and
the dissemination of clean energies by
the existing energy companies. I can’t
wait to work with my colleagues across
the aisle to accomplish that outcome.
Ninety-seven percent of scientists
recognize that climate change is real.
The Department of Defense recognizes
this is one of the top, if not the number
one, national threats to our security.
Let’s work together. Let’s quit point-
ing fingers across the aisle and using
rhetoric that does not move forward an
important issue that all of us should be
fighting hard to address.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, the United
States is a world leader in many areas,
and we need to step up on climate
change.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
oppose this amendment, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Chair, I demand
a recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentleman from Texas will be post-
poned.
The Chair understands that amend-
ment No. 96 will not be offered.
AMENDMENT NO. 98 OFFERED BY MR. BANKS
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No 98 printed
in part B of House Report 116–109.
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division D (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. l. Each amount made available in di-
vision D, except those amounts made avail-
able to the Department of Defense, is hereby
reduced by 14 percent.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 431, the gentleman
from Indiana (Mr. BANKS) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Indiana.
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chair, my amend-
ment would apply a 14 percent reduc-
tion in the amounts made available for
this division. However, it is important
to note that this amendment would not
apply to amounts made available for
the Department of Defense and would
have no effect on foreign military fi-
nancing.
As my colleague highlights, there are
worthy programs in this division to
help us build and maintain strong rela-
tionships around the world, but we can-
not continue to be a dependable friend
to those in need if we do not put our
own fiscal house in order first.
As I mentioned previously, Wash-
ington is addicted to spending. Our na-
tional debt today stands at over $22
trillion. We are set here to add trillions
of dollars more in debt every year for
the foreseeable future if we continue
down this path of spending without any
fiscal discipline.
We need to act now to prevent a debt
crisis that consumes our children and
our grandchildren. Unfortunately, it
appears that this is not a priority for
my friends across the aisle.
America needs leadership to solve
this problem. That is why I am here
today again proposing that we start by
making commonsense reductions to
discretionary spending, like the one
that I am proposing today to this divi-
sion of H.R. 2740.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment, and I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I rise in op-
position to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from New York is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, the amend-
ment applies an indiscriminate 14 per-
cent across-the-board cut to all pro-
grams, projects, and activities in the
bill, apart from those administered by
the Defense Department.
The members of our committee
worked hard to craft a bill that pro-
vides the Secretary of State and the
USAID Administrator the necessary
tools to advance United States eco-
nomic and security interests abroad.
While we did not agree on every issue,
the bill prioritizes the programs and
activities that Members on both sides
of the aisle requested.
For example, under the amendment,
global health programs would be cut by
$1.3 billion, including drastic cuts to
HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health,
family planning, and infectious disease
programs.
Humanitarian assistance, including
funds to respond to those displaced by
the crises in Venezuela, Syria, Iraq,
Yemen, and South Sudan, would be cut
by $1.5 billion.
Embassy security, which ensures the
protection of our diplomatic and devel-
opment personnel and facilities over-
seas, would be cut by $850 million.
Development assistance, which sup-
ports basic education, water, sanita-
tion programs, efforts to combat
human and wildlife trafficking, and
global food security activities in the
developing world would be cut by $583
million.
Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to oppose this amendment, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chair, the contrast
here couldn’t be any clearer. We have
so many young people who are watch-
ing us in the gallery today. At home, I
have three daughters who are aged 9, 7,
and 6. If we don’t do something about a
$22 trillion national debt today, they
are going to be holding the bag for the
lack of leadership in this Congress that
they are seeing firsthand with the
spend, spend, spend mindset of politi-
cians in Washington, D.C.
My colleagues on the other side of
the aisle want to continue spending
outside of our government’s means.
What I hear from families back home
in northeast Indiana is if they can live
within a budget and if they can live
within their means, why can’t Wash-
ington, D.C., do the same?
Hoosiers are used to a State govern-
ment with a balanced budget every
year, that passes balanced budget after
balanced budget and lives within its
means at our State house, as well. Yet,
they see exactly the opposite time and
time again in Washington. They see
deficits on the rise. They see the na-
tional debt grow at astronomical rates,
to over $22 trillion today.
That is why I am here again today,
the second day in a row, offering an
amendment to cut across the board 14
percent without affecting defense
spending or foreign military financing
to address our national security con-
cerns.
Why am I here doing this for the sec-
ond day in a row? It is because the
Democratic majority has failed the
most fundamental leadership test of
all. The majority promised if they got
the majority in the last election, they
would pass a budget. They have failed
to do that. By failing to do that, we are
here today proposing cuts to discre-
tionary spending to the tune of 14 per-
cent.
Now, you might ask yourself, why 14
percent? That seems like an abnormal
number to start with. Fourteen percent
across the board is what it is going to
take to balance the budget.

Committee’s spending and budget task

force over the past several months.
With a group of many of my colleagues,
we worked tirelessly every week to
propose a budget of our own. Right
now, it is the only budget in this Con-
gress that has been proposed. It cuts
spending to the tune of trillions of dol-
lars, and it balances in 6 years.
To get to that balanced budget, it is
an across-the-board 14 percent reduc-
tion in nondefense and discretionary
spending.
Mr. Chair, I am going to be back. I
am going to come back time and time
again, proposing this same amendment
for across-the-board cuts of 14 percent
because my daughters’ generation and
the young people who are watching us
in the gallery today are depending on
it.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The Chair would
remind Members to avoid references to
occupants of the gallery.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I strongly
urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the gentleman’s
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tleman from Indiana (Mr. BANKS).
The question was taken; and the Act-

The motion was agreed to.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
further consideration of the bill (H.R.
2740) making appropriations for the De-
partments of Labor, Health and Human
Services, and Education, and related

tember 30, 2020, and for other purposes,
with Mr. VAN DREW (Acting Chair) in

The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The Acting CHAIR. When the Com-
mittee of the Whole rose earlier today
pursuant to House Resolution 436, fur-

AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MR. ALLEN
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 2 printed in
part A of House Report 116–111.
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
At the end of division D (before the short
title), insert the following:
SEC. ll. Each amount made available by
this division is hereby reduced by 1 percent.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 436, the gentleman
from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Georgia.
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chair, we are nearly
6 months into the Democratic-con-
trolled House of Representatives, and
here we are debating amendments to
an almost $1 trillion minibus, $176 bil-
lion above current budget caps, with-
out even a glimpse of a fiscal year 2020
budget proposal from House Demo-
crats.
You might ask, how did we get to
this point? Well, my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle are operating on
a premise that an increase in defense
spending justifies increases in non-
defense spending across the board.
Now and always, strengthening our
defense should remain priority number
one, but providing more than twice as
much additional funding in fiscal year
2020 for nondefense programs as for de-
fense programs is simply irresponsible.
Additionally, if Congress does not
come to a budget cap agreement, these
spending levels would lead to seques-
tration, which would be devastating to
our military.
Folks, as a former business owner
and someone who has experience oper-
ating within a budget, I am appalled by
the lack of fiscal responsibility being
shown here today. With an almost $22
trillion national debt, this minibus is a
complete disservice to our country and
our fellow Americans.
If we wish to avoid passing an insur-
mountable debt along to the future
generations, we must act immediately
to tighten the purse strings on Wash-
ington’s spending habits.
My amendment today is simple. It
would reduce State and Foreign Oper-
ations spending by 1 percent for fiscal
year 2020. Democrats have increased
this division by $2 billion, bringing for-
eign nondefense spending to a whop-
ping $56 billion.
If you do the math, my amendment
would cut $560 million. Even with my 1
percent cut, this division will still in-
crease spending for fiscal year 2020
compared to fiscal year 2019.
So, in my mind, my Democratic col-
leagues should support my amendment,
as they will still be spending a lot more
of your hard-earned money, just a bit
less than they intended.
It is not my intention to cut funding
going towards our critical ally, Israel.
And while our diplomatic efforts
abroad are necessary, it is equally as
important that we take a hard look at
the balance sheet and make appro-
priate cuts wherever possible.
Also, just to be clear, it was my goal
to offer an amendment to reduce spend-
ing by 1 percent across all branches in
this minibus spending package, with
the exception of defense. However,
House Democrats blocked this effort,
continued to promote out-of-control
government spending and neglecting
our national debt crisis, and only ruled
this amendment in order.
Mr. Chair, I am a proud grandfather
of 13 grandchildren, and I believe it is
my duty to do everything in my power
to avoid placing a $22 trillion—and ris-
ing—burden on their backs.
I urge my colleagues in this body to
support my amendment today and take
a small step towards bringing fiscal re-
sponsibility back to Washington.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I claim
the time in opposition to the gentle-
man’s amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman
from New York is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, our com-
mittee has worked hard on a bipartisan
basis to craft a bill that provides the
Secretary of State and the U.S. admin-
istrator with the necessary tools to ad-
vance United States foreign policy.
As I have said before, I have long op-
posed amendments that indiscrimi-
nately apply across-the-board cuts to
the carefully thought-out funding rec-
ommendations in appropriations bills.
Such amendments make no provision
for protecting high-priority programs
and activities. For example, the
amendment would cut $33 million from
security assistance to Israel. It would
cut $92 million from global health pro-
grams, including $118 million less for
HIV/AIDS; $79 million from lifesaving
humanitarian assistance; and $60 mil-
lion from funds made available to pro-
tect our diplomats and development
personnel and their facilities.
Cuts would also impact funding for
other key allies, such as Jordan,
Egypt, Ukraine, Colombia, and coun-
tries in Eastern Europe battling Rus-
sian aggression and disinformation.

H4686 June 13, 2019
Mr. Chair, I tell my friend, as a
grandmother of eight, I strongly urge
my colleagues to oppose this amend-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chair, I can’t stress
enough just how important it is to the
future of this country that we take
desperately needed steps to rein in our
national debt and restore some fiscal
sanity to this Chamber. H.R. 2740 is an
unserious proposal that will not be
signed into law by President Trump.
I would ask all my colleagues to
think about, again, their grandkids,
their kids, and their great-grandkids
before casting their vote. If we can’t
cut just 1 percent of one spending divi-
sion on a bipartisan basis, then how
will Congress ever get spending under
control?
Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on my
amendment today, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I am pre-
pared to close. I strongly urge a ‘‘no’’

The text of the amendment is as fol-

ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman

Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chair, I rise today
to offer this amendment on behalf of
my friend and colleague from Illinois,
Representative BOST.
This simple, straightforward amend-
ment will ensure that the State De-
partment emphasizes working with
veteran-owned and disabled veteran-
owned small businesses when awarding
contracts and grants.
Small businesses are the backbone of
our Nation’s economy. Veteran-owned
small businesses play an important
part.
The number of veterans and veteran
entrepreneurs continues to grow as
veterans return from overseas, with
many making personal sacrifices to
stand up for America.
Veterans understand the needs of the
State Department in a unique manner
and should be relied upon to supply the
necessary equipment and expertise.
I believe it is our duty to look after
our soldiers when they return home
from serving our country, and we
should continue looking to these he-
roes as the Federal Government con-
tracts with these small businesses.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chair-
man, I claim the time in opposition, al-
though I am not opposed.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Kentucky is

There was no objection.
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chair-
man, this amendment would ensure
that veteran- and service-disabled vet-
eran-owned small businesses are able
to effectively compete for State De-
partment contracts and grants.
We have a moral obligation to help
our veterans, and especially our
wounded veterans, to live a fulfilling
life after they have hung up that uni-
form.
This is a worthy addition to the bill.
I urge its support and thank the gen-
tleman for bringing this amendment
up.
Mr. Chair, I yield such time as she
may consume to gentlewoman from
New York (Mrs. LOWEY).
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, we must
ensure we do everything possible to ex-
pand opportunities for veterans in this
country. I will continue to encourage
the State Department to increase
grant and contract opportunities for
veterans and service-disabled veteran-
owned small businesses.
Mr. Chair, I support this amendment.
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield back the balance of my

Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chair, I appreciate
that we were able to debate this
amendment on the floor today that
would emphasize the State Depart-
ment’s working with veteran-owned

from California (Mr. ROUDA) and a
Member opposed each will control 5

The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Chair, I rise today
in support of my amendment to recog-
nize the contributions of Vietnamese,
Laotian, and Cambodian immigrants
and to discourage attempts to repa-
triate them to those countries.
In 2008, Vietnam and the United
States reached a formal agreement
that contains specific restrictions on
the repatriation of certain individuals
to Vietnam, including barring the repa-
triation of any Vietnamese national
who arrived in the United States before
our two nations established formal dip-
lomatic relations on July 12, 1995.
This limitation in the agreement,
which has not been renegotiated since
its signing, strengthens and protects
our communities by keeping families
together and empowering individuals
who have lived in the United States for
decades to continue to make positive
change in communities across our
country.
Under President Trump’s Adminis-
tration, however, we have seen an in-
crease in deportations of Southeast
Asian immigrants in a push to nego-
tiate repatriation agreements across
Southeast Asia, including using visa
sanctions to unilaterally punish coun-
tries like Laos that do not currently
have such an agreement with the
United States.
I am proud to represent a thriving
Southeast Asian community, including
thousands of men and women and chil-
dren who came to the United States
fleeing violence and genocide during
and after the Vietnam war in search of
a better life.
I call upon President Trump’s admin-
istration to cease these attacks on
Southeast Asian constituents and halt
all efforts to renegotiate the 2008
agreement with Vietnam and negotiate
a new repatriation agreement with
Laos.
I would like to thank the organiza-
tions, like the Southeast Asia Resource
Action Center, Asian Americans Ad-
vancing Justice, and the National Pa-
cific American Bar Association for
their work to support these individuals
and their help in raising this issue be-
fore the House.

I would also like to thank my col-
leagues, especially Representatives
ALAN LOWENTHAL, Lu Correa, and ZOE
LOFGREN for their important work on

ment, although I am not opposed.

June 13, 2019
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentlewoman from New York
is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, while depor-
tation policy is a component of immi-
gration and should most appropriately
be considered by the House Judiciary
Committee, I appreciate my friend
raising awareness on this issue.
The concerns expressed here today
are echoed by many communities
across the country who were distressed
by the administration’s actions. I com-
mend the gentleman from California
for highlighting this matter and urge
my colleagues to support the amend-
ment.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Chair, I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. LOWENTHAL. I rise today in support of
this amendment to provide protections for Vi-
etnamese, Laotian, and Cambodian people
who came to the United States as war refu-
gees. I thank my colleagues, Mr. ROUDA, Mr.
CORREA, and Ms. LOFGREN for their work on
this crucial issue.
Decades ago thousands upon thousands of
Vietnamese, Cambodia, and Laotian refugees
fled strife, war, and persecution in their own
countries and made America their home.
They started families, built businesses, and
formed communities.
They have become part of the American
tapestry—contributing to a nation that wel-
comed them and is now their home.
My district is one of the most diverse in the
nation, and home to some of the largest Viet-
namese and Cambodian communities outside
of both countries.
As the co-chair of both the Vietnam and
Cambodia congressional caucuses, I am inti-
mately aware of the problems these refugees
have faced since arriving in America.
One of the most pressing problems since
the current administration took office is the de-
portation of members of the Vietnamese,
Cambodian, and Laotian communities across
the nation.
Previous Democratic and Republican admin-
istrations put in place safeguards to prevent
these refugees from being forced to return to
countries that don’t want them. These protec-
tions are now under attack by the current ad-
ministration.
These refugees fled war and persecution.
America opened its arms and accepted them.
We cannot turn our backs on them now.
They are our neighbors, our friends, and our
family. Often the case, they also have
spouses and children who are American citi-
zens.
Deporting them back to countries ruled by
authoritarian governments is inhumane and
will separate Americans from their loved ones.
I support this amendment to uphold and ac-
knowledge these refugees’ contributions to our
nation and to protect them from deportation.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. ROUDA).
The amendment was agreed to.
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chair, I move that
the Committee do now rise.
The motion was agreed to.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.
ROUDA) having assumed the chair, Mr.
VAN DREW, Acting Chair of the Com-
mittee of the Whole House on the state

mittee, having had under consideration

tions for the Departments of Labor,
Health and Human Services, and Edu-
cation, and related agencies for the fis-
cal year ending September 30, 2020, and
for other purposes, had come to no res-
olution thereon.

AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 1607
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent to withdraw my
sponsorship in the Fairness to Pet
Owners Act, H.R. 1607.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey?
There was no objection.

HEALTHCARE IS A RIGHT
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, all
Americans, all people have the right to
accessible and affordable healthcare.
While I am proud that we have re-
cently passed five bills that improve
and strengthen healthcare accessi-
bility, lower prescription prices, and
protect access for those with pre-
existing conditions, we still have much
more work to do.
Healthcare is the people’s issue.
When polled, 75 percent of Americans
listed it as the most important issue to
them, and not just healthcare, but af-
fordable, accessible healthcare. We
must fight to improve our healthcare
system.
We must fight the opioid crisis.
We must fight to lower prescription
prices, and we must unite to make sure
that Americans do not go into debt be-
cause they or a loved one has an emer-
gency or are diagnosed with a terrible
illness.
The only way we are going to make
real change, the only way we can pro-
tect people is if we work to come to-
gether to really form real solutions.
My message should be clear:
healthcare is truly a right.
f
ISSUES OF THE DAY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. GOHMERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority
leader.
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is an
interesting process we have for appro-
priating money. Some people are won-
dering why there were so many re-
quests for a recorded vote, because nor-
mally most will go by a voice vote. We
don’t have to gather everybody to-
gether to vote. I think it is important.
I know Members are not supposed to
mention this when they are asking for
a recorded vote, but we have a crisis on
our southern border.
Last month, there were over 144,000
individuals that came into the United
States across our southern border ille-
gally. That would seem to be a crisis.
As I mentioned early this morning,
around 9 o’clock, in my 1-minute
speech, some of us had just returned
from being at Normandy for the 75th
anniversary of D-day.
What an incredible thing that is to
contemplate. And, of course, for those
who know history thoroughly, World
War II, be aware that there was even a
dress rehearsal for D-day. There were
no live rounds that were utilized, and
yet, the Allied forces lost hundreds of
military members during that fiasco of
a practice for D-Day, which some at-
tributed as being partly the reason
that General Eisenhower, as the Su-
preme Allied Commander, had written
out a resignation letter and given it to
his subordinate that tendered his res-
ignation with instructions that if D-
Day went poorly, to please submit his
resignation to his superiors.
He didn’t know how it was going to
come out. They tried to prepare, but
there are different estimates: 150,000,
some up to 170,000, some 158,000 were in-
volved in the D-Day landing at Nor-
mandy in France.
Those courageous individuals that
came ashore—some tried to come
ashore and didn’t make it that were
dropped off too far out. Some had land-
ing crafts that were sunk, but they
were trying to come ashore, and did
come ashore, and there were thousands
of casualties as a result.
Some of the stories bring tears to
your eyes as a person contemplates
what they went through. I had not been
to Normandy before this weekend, and
I am very grateful to Speaker PELOSI
for inviting former members of the
military to accompany her to Nor-
mandy. It was amazing.
I have never been to Pointe du Hoc,
but having attended Texas A&M Uni-
versity, I knew all about, at that time,
Colonel Earl Rudder’s heroic actions as
he took the first group of what were
then called Rangers—and have been
called Rangers since—who trained at
Fort Benning, Georgia, for most of that
training, where I spent 4 years.
He took them up the cliffs. Their
goal, their job, their order was to take
out the big cannons that were doing so
much damage to the Allied forces.
They fought their way up the cliffs, got
to the top, and found out those big
guns had been pulled back down the
hill, so then they had to fight their
way down the hill. But they did even-
tually take out those guns.
There were a lot of mistakes made,
as there are in any conflict, but the de-
termination was to try to soften the
German forces before our troops came

H4688 June 13, 2019
ashore there at Normandy. So planes
were loaded with thousands of tons of
munitions that were to be dropped on
those outposts, those bunkers all along
the beaches.
As they taught us in military
science, you want to have good cross-
ing fields of fire so that you can, unfor-
tunately, kill more people with dif-
ferent lines of fire from different direc-
tions, and Rudder had directed those
placements very carefully and did an
extraordinary job.
That was one of the things the planes
were going to soften up with their tons
of munitions, but there was significant
cloud cover that day, so they were to
delay dropping the bombs, and at a
given point, start counting up to three,
four, five, and then drop their payload
of bombs.
Unfortunately, so many of those
bombs ended up 3 miles past the bunk-
ers they needed to take out. So around
150,000 or so Allied forces, a big part of
those being American troops, came
ashore. They invaded a Nazis-con-
trolled France. They fought valiantly,
and as a result, France was able to go
back to being France.
As a result of the ongoing actions,
the rest of Europe, at least Western
Europe, was able to go about being the
countries they had been—even better
once they built back up—largely, or at
least with great help from the Marshall
Plan.
It was amazing. I was not aware that
so many of the French people still held
what the Americans and the Allies did
in such high regard.
So as our bus got near to—and this
was actually on Sunday—there were
going to be thousands of paratroopers
reenacting their parachuting. Fortu-
nately, nobody landed with their chute
on a church spire and got killed as they
hung there. That didn’t happen.
b 1600
But the chutes were actually more
modernized chutes, so they could con-
trol their descent more easily than
those poor guys did back on June 6 and
the succeeding days in 1944. But we got
off the bus, the Members of Congress,
and were proceeding to where we were
going to be watching from in this little
valley area. And there were thousands
and thousands and thousands of people
who were walking in the same direc-
tion, and most of them had something
to indicate United States, whether it
was a little American flag or scarves
that indicated something to do with
the Stars and Stripes.
At first, I thought: Wow, all of these
thousands of Americans made it over
here for the D-Day 75th anniversary?
This is incredible.
But then I quickly realized the huge
majority of those people were not
Americans; they were French. Though
many of them were children, young
adults, adults with young families,
they knew what America had done to
help save their freedom and their coun-
try.
So it was a very moving experience,
especially when you go down, like, to
Omaha Beach and you think about
those poor guys, Mr. Speaker, so dedi-
cated to liberty and to ending the evil
that the Nazis posed. And to think
about them having friends on either
side being killed, they were at risk,
some were being shot, but still moving
forward and making their way up
through concertina wire. In some
places they would blow holes through
the wire, so they could start getting
through and not be sitting ducks out
on the beach. It is very moving to be
there where so many, as Lincoln said,
‘‘gave the last full measure of devo-
tion.’’
But we get back home, and we see
the report from May that across our
southern border we had at least a min-
imum of 144,000 individuals come across
our southern border illegally. I don’t
know how you don’t call that an inva-
sion, Mr. Speaker. The huge majority
didn’t carry weapons, most did not at
all. They just wanted to get into the
country. But as we have seen repeat-
edly, there are gang members who
come in.
In fact, an article came out June 7 by
Samantha Lock, titled ‘‘ISIS plotted to
smuggle terrorists into the US over the
Mexico border to launch terror at-
tacks, captured jihadi reveals.’’
This article tells us: ‘‘A captured
ISIS fighter has made a chilling confes-
sion detailing how the terrorist group
planned on exploiting vulnerabilities in
the U.S. border with Mexico to take ad-
vantage of smuggling routes and to
target financial institutions.
‘‘Abu Henricki, a Canadian with dual
Trinidadian citizenship, said that he
was sought out to attack the U.S. from
a route starting in Central America.
‘‘ISIS allegedly had plans to exploit
vulnerabilities in the U.S. border with
Mexico.
‘‘The ISIS fighter was interviewed
last month—together with over 160
ISIS defectors and returnees—by re-
search group the International Center
for the Study of Violent Extremism.
‘‘The study, published in Homeland
Security Today, concluded: ‘We have
learned . . . about multiple individuals
who knew of, or were themselves of-
fered, or pressured by the ISIS emni—
intelligence—to return to Europe to
mount attacks at home.
‘‘ ‘We learned that, indeed, there was
at least one ISIS plot for their cadres
to travel from Syria to penetrate the
U.S. southern border by infiltrating
migration routes.’
‘‘Henricki was detained by the SDF
in Rojava, Syria, and spoke with re-
searchers for more than an hour on
May 12, giving his firsthand account of
being attracted to, traveling, joining
and serving in the Islamic State ca-
liphate, first as a fighter and then later
unable to fight due to chronic illness.
‘‘In video footage of Henricki’s con-
fession, he opens up about a plot in
which he says he and other
Trinidadians were invited in late 2016
to attempt to penetrate the U.S. bor-
ders to mount financial attacks.
‘‘He explains: ‘The emni—ISIS intel-
ligence arm—was inviting us.
‘‘ ‘They, what they will have, what
they wanted to do, basically, is they
wanted to do financial attacks. Finan-
cial attacks to cripple the U.S. econ-
omy.
‘‘ ‘Apparently, they have the contacts
or whatever papers they can get to a
false ID, false passports to send me out
for this kind of attack.
‘‘ ‘They have their system of doing it.
So that’s maybe the way that I could
have gone out with other individuals.’
‘‘He adds: ‘It wasn’t me alone. They
were sending you to Puerto Rico and
from Puerto Rico to Mexico.
‘‘ ‘They were going to move me to the
Mexican side of the U.S. southern bor-
der via Puerto Rico.
‘‘ ‘This was masterminded by a guy in
America. Where he is, I do not know.
‘‘ ‘That information, the plan, came
from someone from the New Jersey
State from America.
‘‘ ‘I was going to take a boat from
Puerto Rico into Mexico. He was going
to smuggle me in. I don’t know where
I’d end up.’
‘‘Henricki detailed how he and his
Canadian wife were imprisoned by
ISIS.
‘‘He recounts: ‘I was asked to leave
ISIS to go to America because I’m from
that area. ‘Cause they wanted and
planned to do something, and I refused.
I refused to do it. That is why also I’m
put into ISIS prison and been tortured.
‘‘ ‘They beat me a lot. I was sus-
pended from the back, standing on my
toes, given no food for a few days,
waterboarded—while blindfolded, and
they put a bag over your head.
‘‘ ‘I knew I went to prison because I
said no to their offer of an external at-
tack mission.’
‘‘Anne Speckhard, director of the
International Center for the Study of
Violent Extremism, told FOX News:
‘ISIS has organized plots in Europe
with returnees, so it seems entirely
plausible that they wanted to send
guys out to attack.
‘‘ ‘The issue that makes a North
American attack harder is the travel is
more difficult from Syria.
‘‘ ‘So the idea that they would in-
stead use people who were not known
to their own governments as having
joined ISIS might make it possible for
them to board airplanes.’
‘‘However, Ms. Speckhard reasoned:
‘This plot is likely dead as those who
were pressured to join it are, according
to Abu Henricki, now all dead and ISIS
is in retreat as we know.
‘‘ ‘That doesn’t mean we should dis-
regard that it was a plot.’ ’’
Mr. Speaker, I would also state, when
we have indications of ISIS plots to in-
vade our country, have attacks on fi-
nancial institutions to kill Americans,
we should take them seriously. If they
have made one plot, as we have seen
around the country, there are bound to
be many plots.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4689
June 13, 2019
There is now a discredited FBI Direc-
tor named Comey who at one time tes-
tified—it used to mean something when
an FBI Director testified before Con-
gress. Comey has hurt that a great deal
because of so many falsehoods that
have been spoken while under oath
here on Capitol Hill. But he had indi-
cated that we have ISIS investigations
and ISIS cells in every State in the
Union, at one time, basically to that
affect. That would tell us that this plot
recently discovered is not inconsistent
with what a former FBI Director was
concerned about some years back.
So it is important to control our bor-
ders and to know who is coming in be-
cause we know people want to take
down the United States of America.
People who have evil intentions know
if you take down the United States of
America as a power, then evil can pre-
vail throughout the world.
I had mentioned to a few Australians
here a year or so ago, one of the other
Members of Congress said that it seems
like we keep losing liberties here, free
speech, they wanted to take away our
Second Amendment rights. Well, if we
lose our liberties, then we may just all
need to go to Australia.
None of the three smiled or laughed
at all. I thought they would find it
amusing. One of them said, Do you not
understand? If the United States loses
its liberty, China will take over Aus-
tralia before anybody could get there
from the United States.
We simply need the United States to
stay strong.
I heard that in Africa, from some
Christians there—and they know a lot
about being under assault as Boko
Haram had got so powerful there. When
I was there in Nigeria trying to help
some folks there, I was told that the
Obama administration had given them
word, Look, we will help you and give
you more help with Boko Haram, but
first you have got to legalize abortion
and same-sex marriage. Until you do
that, we are not going to be able to be
as much help as we could.
As one Catholic Bishop in Nigeria no-
tably proclaimed:
The President of the United States
should know our religious beliefs are
not for sale to anyone, including the
United States.
Other expressions from other African
leaders who were Christians were simi-
lar.
So this information about ISIS hav-
ing plots that include crossing our bor-
der and attacks on our country is not
really new.
I became the brunt of Democratic
scoffers. One comedian was making
fun, and none of them bothered to men-
tion that I was quoting the FBI Direc-
tor in testimony from here on Capitol
Hill. Like I say, back then, an FBI Di-
rector testifying under oath had more
credibility than what an FBI Director
under oath has now.
But it was the FBI Director who indi-
cated that we know that there are peo-
ple from the Middle East who have
changed their names to sound His-
panic. They have come to Mexico and
tried to blend in with Hispanics coming
across our border.
I was belittled and made fun of, but
it didn’t change the facts of what had
been testified to under oath by some-
body who the Democrats used to love.
It is a threat, and we have been told
year after year how the threat in-
creases and all the different plots.
There are very few people I am aware
of on the other side of the aisle who
haven’t at some point in the last 10, 12
years talked about the need to secure
our border.
Many of my Democratic friends have
talked about the need for a wall or
something to stop the flood of illegal
immigration. Having done so much
contemplation about the 150,000 or so
who invaded Nazi-occupied France in
1944, heck, we had virtually that in 1
month. They didn’t all come to shore
with weapons, but it is an invasion
when that many people are trying suc-
cessfully to come into your country.
As we heard, again, through testi-
mony this week, 90 to 95 percent of the
people claiming asylum are not al-
lowed if they are not legitimate
claims, but, unfortunately, the big
bulk of those who claim asylum are
given hearing dates. Some during the
Obama administration would be 4 years
or so away, and 90 percent or so do not
show up for those hearings.
That tells the world we are a broken
country and that the rule of law that
has meant so much in this country and
that has given other countries hope
that there is at least one place in the
world where people are not above the
law—nobody is—and where the law
really matters. Sure, there are excep-
tions and there are mistakes, but they
really do try to enforce the law across
the board.
b 1615
I mean, the world has seen, with the
huge invasion coming across our bor-
der—and, for this year, the estimates
now are that certainly over a million
people will flood in, invade the United
States illegally.
And how tragic that any little chil-
dren would ever be sent unaccompanied
to our border, risking snakes, risking
the elements, risking all kinds of
things.
To a lesser extent, little boys, appar-
ently, are being raped; but girls, we are
told about 25 percent, will be raped on
the way through Mexico into the
United States.
How tragic that we lured them to
America with hopes that we are going
to continue to allow violation of our
own laws unimpeded, that we are going
to allow this country to be over-
whelmed with people who have never
been educated to what it means to keep
and nourish a self-governing country.
It is not natural in the world to have
a people who effectively self-govern.
That is why we see the U.N. composed
of so many countries that are ruled by
dictators.
Even now, 230 years after our Con-
stitution was ratified, we still have dic-
tators all over the world. The Founders
were hoping that, if we got this little
experiment right, then it would become
a new order of things. Novus ordo
seclorum. That is why that is part of
our great seal, the two-sided great seal.
If we get this right, countries around
the world will want to emulate what
we have done so they can self-govern.
But, as Ben Franklin said there in
the Constitutional Convention: ‘‘If a
sparrow cannot fall to the ground with-
out His notice, is it probable an empire
could rise without His concurring aid?’’
We have been assured in the Sacred
Scripture that, unless the Lord build
the house, they labor in vain that build
it. He said: I firmly believe this. I also
believe without His—God’s—concurring
aid, we shall succeed in this political
building no better than the builders of
Babel. We will be confounded by our
local partial interests, and we, our-
selves, shall become a byword down
through the ages.
The reason he knew that was because
this was a chance to go beyond any-
thing the Greeks, the Athenians had
done in the way of trying to self-gov-
ern. This was beyond anything anybody
had ever done.
Sure, there was a senate in Rome.
Sure, there was a parliament in Eng-
land. But this was going to be true self-
government through representation,
chosen by the people.
And he knew, if we get it right, ev-
erybody is going to want to follow this
example. But, if we get it wrong, peo-
ple, for the rest of history, will look
back and point and say: They had the
best chance of ever making self-govern-
ment work, and they blew it.
So, when the Convention was over
and the lady there in Philadelphia
asked Franklin, ‘‘What have you given
us?’’ as most people hopefully know,
‘‘A republic, Madam, if you can keep
it.’’
Because he knew, this is not some-
thing that is eternal. No government,
no country, no form of government
ever lasts forever. They are only tem-
porary.
And thank God, literally, we have
been allowed to self-govern for 230
years under our Constitution, 230 years
this year.
But we are in real danger. In order to
preserve this form of government under
our Constitution—as John Adams said,
this Constitution is intended for a
moral and religious people; it is wholly
inadequate for the government of any
other.
So, for too long, too many schools
have been teaching there is no real
right or wrong, so much is relative.
The most important thing is that we
are tolerant of everybody and every-
thing.
But the fact is, if you are tolerant of
everybody and everything, then there
really are no criminal laws, and you
quickly descend into anarchy.
You have to be intolerant of those
who break the law. You have to be in-
tolerant of those who hurt others. But

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4690 June 13, 2019
most of us were taught, growing up:
‘‘Sticks and stones may break my
bones, but words will never hurt me.’’
Well, the truth is words do hurt. The
Bible talks about the damage that a
tongue can do.
But only in recent years have we de-
generated from the time of the Revolu-
tion’s great proclamation, usually
quoting Voltaire, though there is some
indication he may not have been the
origination of the phrase: I disagree
with what you say, but I will defend to
the death your right to say it.
Now, that has degenerated, basically,
in today’s society to: I disagree with
what you say. I am going to get you
fired. I want to make your family so
miserable that they all want to die. I
am going to try to keep your family
from ever being employed. I am going
to make you miserable living in your
house. I am going to just create chaos.
You are going to regret the day you
ever disagreed with me.
Wow. What a degeneration from what
spurred a revolution: I disagree with
what you say, but I will defend to the
death your right to say it.
Now we have come to a place in
America where the only people who are
allowed to be intolerant are those who
say they are tolerant. But they are al-
lowed to be intolerant toward Chris-
tians who truly follow the teachings of
Moses, whose bust is up above the mid-
dle door in the gallery.
He had some absolute laws that he
set down. And the reason that he is the
most prominent lawgiver, according to
the time that this House floor was
built, was because it was thought his
Ten Commandments were the greatest
law gift ever in history.
Now, Hammurabi, his profile is up
there. Even though the federally man-
dated test does not have significant
history required anymore, those who
have had some history may have
learned about the Code of Hammurabi
and the Justinian Code. His profile is
next to Hammurabi.
And you come clear around to Napo-
leon. Yes, there is a Napoleonic Code,
and it is still the basis for laws in Lou-
isiana.
But laws used to mean something,
and we could disagree and not be dis-
agreeable. And, even to this day, there
are Democrats I care very deeply about
as individual human beings, and we can
disagree and still like each other and
we can find some common things to
work on. But, for heaven’s sake, we
have got to get beyond this business of
destroying people who just disagree
with us, not letting them eat in a pub-
lic restaurant, not letting them go out
in public to games or to shows without
trying to make their lives miserable.
The most intolerant people in the
country these days are the ones who
say, ‘‘We are the tolerant ones,’’ when
they have become anti-Semitic, many
have become anti-Christian.
Oh, they will say, ‘‘We are Chris-
tian,’’ but, as Jesus said: You will
know them by their fruits, and their
fruits are not particularly sweet.
But this is a crucial time, and there
is an invasion going on, and we need to
do something about it.
The President is doing all he can to
try to secure our southern border. But,
as we saw last week, we passed another
bill through the House—at least the
majority did—that was basically a
flashing neon sign to those who want
to come into the United States ille-
gally: You better come on now because
we just passed a bill in the House that
will legalize people.
So the thought of some around the
world who just want to come here and
have a better way of life is: Gee, if I
can get there, maybe I can claim that
I was there before whatever the cutoff
date is.
We have seen that happen before.
And others like ISIS are thinking: Gee,
thank goodness there are people in
Congress who don’t want the borders
secure. They don’t want President
Trump to have a victory, so they are
leaving it open so we can keep pouring
in. Let’s take advantage. Let’s get over
there and come through.
And then, as if it is not enough of a
crisis with an invasion coming in every
month through our southern border,
coming illegally, we keep getting more
and more information about the ille-
gality, even criminality, within the De-
partment of Justice, the FBI, and even,
potentially, the intel community. More
to follow in days ahead on the intel
community.
But there is a release here from the
Office of the Inspector General, the De-
partment of Justice. This was dated
May 29, 2019. It says:
The Department of Justice, Office of the
Inspector General, initiated this investiga-
tion upon receipt of information from the
Federal Bureau of Investigation alleging
that a then-FBI Deputy Assistant Director
had numerous contacts with members of the
media in violation of FBI policy.
Now, that is a violation of policy, not
necessarily a violation of the law. But
the report goes on:
Additionally, it was alleged that the Dep-
uty Assistant Director of the FBI may have
disclosed law enforcement or other sensitive
information to the media without authoriza-
tion. This matter is among the Office of In-
spector General investigations referenced on
page 430 of the OIG’s ‘‘Review of Allegations
Regarding Various Actions by the Depart-
ment and the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion in Advance of the 2016 Election.’’
The OIG investigation concluded that the
Deputy Assistant Director engaged in mis-
conduct when he: 1—and it could be she—dis-
closed to the media the existence of informa-
tion that had been filed under seal in Federal
court, in violation of 18 U.S.C. section 401,
Contempt of Court; 2, provided without au-
thorization FBI law enforcement sensitive
information to reporters on multiple occa-
sions; and, 3, had dozens of official contacts
with the media without authorization, in
violation of FBI policy.
The OIG also found that the Deputy Assist-
ant Director of the FBI engaged in mis-
conduct when the DAD accepted a ticket,
valued at approximately $225, to attend a
media-sponsored dinner, as a gift from a
member of the media, in violation of Federal
regulations and FBI policy.
Then, here is a single line, from a
single paragraph:
Prosecution of the Deputy Assistant Direc-
tor was declined.
b 1630
The OIG has completed this inves-
tigation and is providing support to the
FBI for appropriate action.
Having questioned Inspector General
Horowitz, I know that as inspector gen-
eral of the DOJ, Michael Horowitz did
a lot of work in compiling the report
that he provided to Congress, to our
Judiciary Committee. He had about 500
pages, most of which included evidence
of outrageous bias, prejudice, hatred
against candidate Donald Trump and
then against elected President Donald
Trump.
The bias and prejudice that were doc-
umented were astounding, especially
for some of us who have had very good
friends, Republican, Democrat, many
of them I don’t even know what party
affiliation they are because they are
about enforcing the law, right and
wrong, and they do a great job. That
includes people in the FBI, ATF, and
the Department of Justice, specifi-
cally.
Because they are humans, there are
always going to be some problems here
and there, some people who are prob-
lems. It is always going to happen.
But to have top people in the FBI,
the DOJ, who are so flagrantly using
their power to go after and try to de-
stroy a candidate’s election, and then
try to use their power as an insurance
policy to take him out if he were to get
elected, is absolutely astounding.
Ever since the first report came out,
and we had 500 pages of horrific bias
and prejudice, meanness, hatred toward
Donald Trump and those who worked
with him, the Democrat-appointed in-
spector general, Michael Horowitz,
after accumulating all of that over-
whelming evidence, comes to the mind-
boggling conclusion that there is no in-
dication it affected any investigation.
As I told him, you gathered the evi-
dence, apparently did a good job, and
you, as a Democrat appointee, with
lots of Democrat friends, you realized
that: Gee, this really looks bad for my
friends, and I have thrown them no
bone in this whole investigation. I will
do that so they don’t get too mad at
me in my conclusion. So, ergo, I con-
clude there is no indication that bias
affected any investigation.
Are you kidding me? With all the evi-
dence he gathered, and you see how the
investigation into Hillary Clinton’s al-
leged violations—and now we know, ac-
tual violations of the law—how they
were swept under the rug and dis-
regarded, and you have the nerve to
say the bias didn’t affect that?
Having a conference between the At-
torney General herself and the husband
of the person being investigated on a
tarmac that they thought nobody
would ever find out about, but some re-
porter sees Clinton and realizes: Whoa,
what have we got going on here?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4691
June 13, 2019
He wasn’t going to play golf in 100-
plus degree weather in Arizona. They
didn’t meet out on the tarmac to talk
about grandchildren. That is ridicu-
lous.
Immediately after that is when Hil-
lary Clinton made herself available.
And what did the FBI do? Unlike any-
thing they do in a regular investiga-
tion, they didn’t have notes. They
didn’t record the statements.
They were basically spying on Flynn
and had transcripts of his information
before they asked him questions.
That is what you call a perjury trap.
They don’t tell you they have tran-
scripts of your prior conversations, and
they ask you what was said. When you
don’t remember exactly word for word
specifically, or you don’t remember
something that may or may not have
come up, then they have you. You just
lied to the FBI.
They can prosecute you, which they
did with Michael Flynn, even though
the two investigating officers or agents
of the FBI said: We do not believe that
he intended any deception. He thought
he was being honest.
Well, they prosecuted him anyway.
That was their effort to get at Donald
Trump. It didn’t work.
They have done everything they pos-
sibly can. After 2 years of investiga-
tion, after basically trying to extort
friends, family, anybody who had con-
tact with Donald Trump, they got
nothing.
It appeared pretty obvious. Cohen
wanted to give them something if he
could, but he didn’t have anything le-
gitimate. And he has lied too much
under oath to be a significant witness.
We have seen what has happened
with a weaponized FBI and Department
of Justice.
I didn’t know Christopher Wray when
he took over as FBI Director, and I had
hopes that he would clean up the FBI
and help restore it back to being an
agency that was known worldwide for
its honesty and integrity. Unfortu-
nately, whatever personal reasons he
has, personally, I think he is just try-
ing to sweep as much under the rug as
he can, hoping that the FBI will get be-
yond all the lies and criminality in-
volved at the top of the FBI, and then
maybe it will get better, instead of just
facing up to the facts.
One of the clear indications that he
is not willing to do that is the fact that
he continued, even in August of last
year, to have reports come out from
the FBI saying they have seen no evi-
dence that Hillary Clinton’s private
server was ever hacked.
Well, that is true. They have not.
The reason they have not is because
they did not want to see the evidence
that the intel community’s inspector
general found showing beyond any rea-
sonable doubt, 100 percent certainty,
that Hillary Clinton’s private server
was hacked.
I didn’t want to use the country at
the time I asked Peter Strzok about it,
and he lied about that. But Frank
Rucker, as the investigator for the
intel community IG, went hurriedly to
the FBI. He talked to the director of
their counterintelligence, a guy named
Peter Strzok, and their liaison at the
FBI, Dean Chappell.
Frank Rucker had an attorney from
the IG intel, Jeanette Mitchell, I be-
lieve. He said: Hey, I know you guys
said you found no evidence that her
private server was hacked, but we now
know there is no question her private
server was hacked. It was hacked by
China.
There were embedded instructions in
that private server from the Chinese
intelligence. It directed every email
coming in and out of her private server
to go to this Chinese intelligence agen-
cy in the United States.
There was a glitch with four emails.
But over 30,000 others, going in and
out, they went straight to Chinese in-
telligence. We know that.
Frank Rucker was surprised that
Peter Strzok and Dean Chappell didn’t
look surprised. They just said, basi-
cally: Okay, thank you.
He thought they would be blown
away: Wow, really? Are you serious? Do
you really have this evidence? Maybe
we should see it.
No, they didn’t ask to see the evi-
dence. They didn’t ask to review it.
They didn’t ask for a report. They
shook his hand and sent him on his
way. Well, he wasn’t sure if they shook
hands or not, but they sent him on his
way.
For Christopher Wray to continue to
come out and have statements come
from the FBI saying they have never
seen any evidence that Hillary Clin-
ton’s personal server was ever hacked
continues a fraud being put out at the
top of the FBI.
I don’t know, I haven’t talked to the
President about Christopher Wray. But
I believe we need a different FBI Direc-
tor who is not going to continue frauds
that were perpetrated by people like
Peter Strzok.
I know there are a lot of Republicans
that keep saying: Oh, yeah, but when
Michael Horowitz comes out with his
next report, it is going to be dev-
astating.
Oh, yeah, well, we have already seen
in the last couple of weeks that he gets
information that somebody has com-
mitted crimes, and the FBI, the DOJ,
haven’t learned anything. They still
have too many Obama administration
and Sally Yates subordinates working
over there with their own agenda. They
are deciding: Let’s don’t prosecute peo-
ple.
If history is any indication, and
Horowitz does what did he before, he
will come out with a report that has
devastating information about crimes
committed by FBI agents and people in
the Department of Justice. Most of us
will think it is horrific, and the conclu-
sion will be: But it really didn’t infect
anything that the FBI or the DOJ was
doing, so there is no reason to pros-
ecute anybody.
If history is an indication of the fu-
ture, that is what we can expect from
Horowitz’s next IG report: Sure, there
was a lot of criminality, but nothing
worth prosecuting. Nothing to see here,
move along.
We have real trouble. But John Sol-
omon wrote about this matter on June
13. ‘‘Feds Gone Wild: DOJ’s Stunning
Inability to Prosecute Its Own Bad Ac-
tors.’’
‘‘One was caught red-handed engaged
in nepotism. Another, a lawyer no less,
admitted to shoplifting at a Marine
barracks store. A third leaked sealed
court information to the news media.
And a fourth engaged in fraud by turn-
ing a government garage into a per-
sonal repair shop. Four cases, all
solved in the last month, with suspects
who cost taxpayers hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars and significant
breaches of public trust.
‘‘But these weren’t your everyday
perps. All were U.S. Department of
Justice employees who are supposed to
catch other criminals while working
for the FBI, the DEA, and U.S. attor-
neys’ offices. Instead, they broke the
law or violated the rules. And all man-
aged to escape prosecution, despite
their proven transgressions.
‘‘Recent Justice Department discipli-
nary files tell an undeniable story.’’
On down, it said: ‘‘DOJ is doing a
poor job of punishing its own. In cases
closed in the past month, more than a
half dozen FBI, DEA, U.S. attorney and
U.S. marshal officials were allowed to
retire, do volunteer work, or keep their
jobs as they escaped criminal charges
that everyday Americans probably
would not.
‘‘In most instances, the decisions
were made by Federal prosecutors who
work with the very figures impacted by
or committing the bad conduct. In
local law enforcement, that go-easy
phenomenon is known as the ‘thin blue
line.’ ’’
I would differ with that. I don’t be-
lieve that is what most of us think of
as the thin blue line.
Nonetheless, it concludes: ‘‘Even be-
fore the recent spate of closed IG inves-
tigations, questions surfaced about
DOJ’s willingness to punish its own.
That is because fired FBI Director An-
drew McCabe was recommended for
prosecution more than 15 months ago
for lying about news leaks and, so far,
has faced no criminal charges.’’
The article also points out that there
was the FBI lawyer who got caught in
an embarrassing criminal act at the
Marine Corps barracks commissary at
Quantico. ‘‘The FBI attorney admitted
to placing numerous cosmetic items,
valued at $257.99 and belonging to the
MCB Quantico Exchange, in her purse
without the intention to pay for them
and did not pay for them before leaving
the store. The FBI attorney further ad-
mitted that between February 2016 and
her arrest in February 2018, she had
shoplifted at the MCB Quantico Ex-
change one to two additional times and
at other private retailers in the area on
two to three occasions.’’

‘‘The investigation concluded her
conduct violated Federal criminal law
and FBI policy regarding unpro-
fessional conduct. But here was the
outcome: ‘Criminal prosecution was de-
ferred pending the FBI attorney’s com-
pletion of 125 hours of community serv-
ice, after which all charges were dis-
missed.’ ’’
A few weeks community service, she
was still at her job at the time the IG
issued the report.
I mean, this is serious stuff.
The article also goes on: ‘‘One of the
internal affairs that stunned Members
of Congress this month directly grew
out of the interwoven Hillary Clinton
email and Russia collusion investiga-
tions in 2016, during then-FBI Director
James Comey’s tenure.
‘‘The IG concluded that an FBI Dep-
uty Assistant Director engaged in mul-
tiple improper news media leaks while
those investigations were ongoing, in-
cluding one that violated a sealed
court order, and accepted an improper
gratuity from the news media. But
prosecution was declined, yet again.
FBI officials say they are considering
discipline against the supervisor.’’
The author, John Solomon, says:
‘‘Records I reviewed indicate that more
misconduct eerily similar to that al-
ready uncovered is being investigated.
For example, the IG fraud unit opened
a case in March and began interviewing
whistleblowers about a new contract
fraud matter inside the DEA, emails
show.
‘‘It used to be that those who were
entrusted to enforce the law were held
to the highest standards.
‘‘Today, however, there is a troubling
pattern of officers being held to a lower
standard inside a Department where
critics fear there is a dual system of
justice.’’
So this is a dangerous time in our
history. We know that no country lasts
forever, no form of government lasts
forever. We have had 230 years since
1789, when George Washington was
sworn in as President, John Adams as
Vice President, and the Congress was
sworn in there at Federal Hall in New
York City, after which, a couple min-
utes of speeches, they walked down
Wall Street to St. Peters Chapel and
they had a prayer service to pray for
this new country.
When was the last time every elected
Member of Congress, the President of
the United States, and the Vice Presi-
dent of the United States, regardless of
political beliefs, came together in one
accord and prayed in consecrating our
country to God Almighty?
We do have a Presidential Prayer
Breakfast every year, but wouldn’t it
be nice if we could do something like
get us started off on a foot that eventu-
ally led to the end of slavery, eventu-
ally led to true civil rights?
But now it has led to the kind of ar-
rogance that leads to the end of the Re-
public that we may not keep much
longer if we don’t come back to the ba-
sics.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
God of our silent tears, You have put
gladness in our hearts. Give our law-
makers such reverence for You that
their words and actions will honor You.
In Your presence, may they cultivate
humility to acknowledge their needs,
trust to ask You for help, and wisdom
to obey Your commands. Walk with
them throughout this day, reminding
them that there is no purity without
vigilance, no learning without effort,
and no mastery without discipline.
Lord, inspire them to pay the price
required to glorify Your Name.
Strengthen their resolve to choose the
right and refuse the wrong.
We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized.
f
NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, this
week the Senate has been remarkably
productive in confirming more of the
President’s well-qualified nominees.
We have confirmed nine newly minted
judges to fill vacancies on the Federal
bench.
Today we will turn to the executive
branch and confirm David Stilwell to
serve as Assistant Secretary of State
for East Asian and Pacific Affairs and
Edward Crawford to serve as Ambas-
sador to Ireland.
Remember, earlier this spring, we
put in place a modest reform to Senate
rules so we could consider these
uncontroversial, lower level nomina-
tions at a more reasonable pace. That
had been the Senate’s normal tradition
until very recently, and so we restored
it.
At the time, I recall my friends
across the aisle insisting that the ma-
jority would use these more efficient
procedures to push through all kinds of
polarizing and controversial people.
That is what they argued—if we made
this modest rule change, we would be
pushing through all these polarizing
and controversial people.
Well, here are a few of the rollcall
votes the Senate has taken on nomina-
tions this week: 91 to 5, 62 to 34, 77 to
19, 85 to 11. Yesterday afternoon, on a
procedural vote for Mr. Stilwell, it was
93 to 4. A pretty controversial bunch.
So virtually all of us can remember a
time when nominations of this sort
would have passed the Senate on a
voice vote. These days, Democrats are
making us file cloture and spend floor
time on each, but at least our new Sen-
ate rules are helping us get these thor-
oughly bipartisan nominees through at
a more efficient pace.
f
ARMS SALES
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, on another
matter, later today the Senate will
vote on two resolutions that would un-
dermine U.S. influence and credibility
in the Middle East and ultimately
make the region a more dangerous
place. Some of our colleagues seek to
block arms sales to two of the closest
partners of the United States in the re-
gion—Bahrain and Qatar.
These resolutions are misguided.
They would make the United States a
less reliable partner, weaken the influ-
ence we have with our friends, and
open the door to other more unscrupu-
lous powers like Russia and China.
There is this small matter that nei-
ther of these resolutions would even
solve the problem that seems to have
motivated them. I understand many
Members of this body are genuinely
concerned about some of the actions of
our Saudi partners in Yemen. Fortu-
nately, the Senate has repeatedly ex-
pressed these concerns directly

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3452 June 13, 2019
through our legislative and oversight
authority. As I stated in the past,
Members should share their concerns
and discuss these matters directly with
members of our administration or with
Saudi officials.
If Senators are upset about the State
Department’s recent invocation of a
national emergency to advance arms
sales to Saudi Arabia, they will have
an opportunity to vote on that matter
later. So the Senate has ample oppor-
tunity to make our voice heard about
Riyadh’s behavior, but the two resolu-
tions we vote on today are not that op-
portunity. It is something else.
Whatever frustrations my colleagues
may feel with the course of the conflict
in Yemen, taking swipes at our rela-
tionships with Bahrain and Qatar is
certainly not the response. Bahrain’s
involvement in the Yemen conflict has
been limited to defensive border secu-
rity operations and, for the past 2
years, Qatar has been completely unin-
volved. Moreover, both Bahrain and
Qatar provide absolutely essential sup-
port to our military operations in the
region, without which our ability to
project power and protect U.S. inter-
ests would be severely challenged.
I assume everyone knows Qatar is
home to the U.S. Central Command’s
forward headquarters in the region,
with 10,000 U.S. personnel and upward
of 100 aircraft. It is the hub for many of
our ongoing efforts against ISIS and
other regional threats.
In Bahrain, you will find the head-
quarters of the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet.
That is another 7,000 U.S. personnel,
plus assets, responsible for command
and control of over 3 million square
miles of international waters.
So I would remind our colleagues of
the briefing we received recently about
the growing Iranian threat in the re-
gion. I would encourage them to reflect
on recent attacks, probably by Iran or
its proxies, against civilian vessels in
UAE, against civilian airports in Saudi
Arabia and UAE, and near our Embassy
in Baghdad. In fact, literally just hours
ago, two more commercial shipping
vessels were apparently attacked off
the coast of Oman. These attacks may
appear directed at the countries that
use them to export petrochemicals or
at the international owners of the ves-
sels, but the fact is, they threaten the
very underpinnings of the global trad-
ing system and customary Law of the
Sea that ensures freedom of transit on
the seas.
We don’t know who is responsible for
these latest attacks—not yet, any-
way—but it is not unreasonable to sus-
pect an Iranian hand in them. I hope,
in coming days, we have clarity about
who is responsible, but what is clear is
the growing tension and instability in
that region.
So at a time of growing threats to
U.S. personnel, interests, and partners
posed by Iran, do we really want to
send this kind of signal to our part-
ners?
If we turn our back on them, can we
continue to count on the significant
support they provide us or the freedom
of maneuver our large presence in their
countries affords us?
As the State Department has an-
nounced, the proposed sales that are at
issue today would provide each of these
host nations with important enhanced
security capabilities, including anti-
aircraft systems and support equip-
ment. They will also tie these nations
closer to the United States at a time
when our adversaries would happily—
happily—sell comparable weapons at
less cost and with fewer restrictions.
In recent years, we have seen both
Republican and Democratic adminis-
trations seek to reduce the U.S. mili-
tary footprint in the region and have
our partners assume more responsi-
bility for their own security. So it is
curious that Senators would want to
not only sever security ties with these
partners but also limit their ability to
defend themselves.
In each of these cases, the U.S. arms
sales in question have followed normal
procedures; they have been properly
screened and vetted; and they have
been reviewed and approved by both
the chairmen and ranking members of
the Foreign Relations Committee and
House Foreign Affairs Committee.
Let me say that again: The chairman
and ranking members of these commit-
tees reviewed and approved these arms
sales. That is bipartisan, bicameral
support.
So in sum, I would ask my colleagues
who support these resolutions whether
they have even spoken to the Bahraini
or Qatari Ambassadors to discuss any
concerns. I would encourage them to
visit Doha and Manama to confer with
the leaders of these countries and
speak with thousands of American sail-
ors and airmen based there.
I would encourage my colleagues to
ask our own senior military officials
whether we will be better off if our
partners purchase Russian or Chinese
military systems instead of ours. I
would encourage them to ask our dip-
lomats whether America will have
more or less influence with our part-
ners if we capriciously block their pur-
chase of American weapons.
I strongly urge each of our colleagues
to reject these resolutions.
f
BORDER SECURITY
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, all
this week, I have been calling atten-
tion to the fact that the Democrats
over in the House spent 6 weeks ignor-
ing the urgent need for more funding
on the crisis on our southern border. I
have recited one quotation after an-
other from the administration leaders
who are responsible for securing our
Nation and caring for individuals while
they are detained. They are pleading
with us to act.
‘‘We are at a full-blown emergency.
. . . The system is broken.’’ That is the
Acting Commissioner of Customs and
Border Protection. It couldn’t be more
clear.
‘‘We are running out of money. We
are functionally out of space.’’ That
one is from the Secretary of Health and
Human Services.
I have also run down the underlying
statistics. The flood of people attempt-
ing to cross the U.S.-Mexico border has
continued at historic levels. Our border
agents are overwhelmed. Our facilities
are filled beyond capacity—in some
cases, with more than seven times
more men, women, and children than
their intended capacity.
This is a full-fledged crisis, and ev-
erybody knows it. The status quo can-
not hold. Already, the Department of
Homeland Security is having to move
people and money away from other im-
portant efforts to triage more help to-
ward the border.
The administration has been saying
this is a crisis. The officials on the
ground have been saying this is a cri-
sis. My Republican colleagues and I
have been saying repeatedly this is a
crisis. And lest anyone think this is
some partisan exercise, the New York
Times editorial board has been saying
it is a crisis. There were two editorials
over the last several weeks. The first
headline says: ‘‘Congress, Give Trump
His Border Money,’’ and ‘‘When Will
Congress Get Serious About the Suf-
fering at the Border?’’
Those are headlines in the New York
Times, not frequently allied with this
administration. Everybody seems to
understand that, except Democrats
over in the House.
It is not as if our House colleagues
are too busy working on pragmatic, bi-
partisan legislation with any shot at
becoming law. No, here is what they
are up to. One House committee spent
yesterday holding a hearing on path-
ways to single-payer health insur-
ance—in other words, barking up the
tree of Medicare for None, their big
proposal to take away every Ameri-
can’s private health insurance, to take
away Medicare as we know it, and force
everyone into a new, untested, one-
size-fits-all government system. That
is what they are up to over there. That
is the score. They have no time for the
border crisis but plenty of time for so-
cialist daydreams.
Even my colleague the Democratic
leader has admitted the Democratic-
controlled House is the problem here.
We have even heard it from House
Democrats themselves. One told re-
porters that his progressive colleagues
weren’t convinced the emergency fund-
ing was necessary. One Democratic
Congressman says progressive col-
leagues were not convinced that emer-
gency funding was necessary.
So it seems ‘‘the resistance’’ has con-
vinced Washington Democrats that
they need to come down to the left of
the New York Times editorial page.
There is not much space over there to
the left of the New York Times edi-
torial page.
But Senate Republicans are not
going to be deterred. The crisis at the
border hasn’t gone anywhere, and nei-
ther has our resolve to address it. Next

week, the Senate is going to move for-
ward. The Appropriations Committee
will vote again. I hope Democrats in
the House of Representatives will fi-
nally realize ‘‘the resistance’’ doesn’t
pay the bills. No more political pos-
turing, no more automatic knee-jerk
opposition to absolutely everything the
administration asks for—it is way past
time for action.
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, let me
express my appreciation to the major-
ity leader for highlighting this crisis at
the border. There is no State more di-
rectly impacted in our United States
than the State of Texas.
We, obviously, share 1,200 miles of
common border with Mexico, and this
is a humanitarian crisis. As the major-
ity leader said, not only the New York
Times editorial page, but Barack
Obama in 2014 called far fewer numbers
than are coming across today a human-
itarian and security crisis then, and it
has gotten nothing but worse.
I appreciate the leader’s bringing this
to a head and holding Members ac-
countable. We know that people talk a
good game sometimes, but there is no-
where to hide when it comes to an up-
or-down vote on this emergency appro-
priations bill.
I would add that there are other
measures taking place. The chairman
of the Judiciary Committee, as the
Presiding Officer knows, is working on
a bill that would address the under-
lying asylum laws, which are being ex-
ploited by the human smugglers who
are getting rich moving people across
Mexico from Central America into the
United States and charging them be-
tween $5,000 and $10,000 a head—some-
times more. It has been the unwilling-
ness of the Democrats to engage on
that underlying asylum law and a fix
there that has precipitated or contrib-
uted to this humanitarian crisis.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Will the Senator
from Texas yield for a question?
Mr. CORNYN. I will.
Mr. MCCONNELL. As a member of
the Judiciary Committee involved in
this, is there any indication there
might be bipartisan support for author-
izing this legislation that you all are
working on in committee?
Mr. CORNYN. We hope to see. And we
will see one way or the other when we
vote on this legislation next week.
I am happy to say that my Demo-
cratic colleague HENRY CUELLAR from
Laredo, TX, which is more directly im-
pacted probably than any place on the
border, joined me in one proposal we
call the HUMANE Act, which would
deal with this underlying asylum issue.
We have been working with the
chairman, Senator GRAHAM, to come up
with a consensus piece of legislation
that will really plug the dike that has
been breached now, which has caused
this humanitarian crisis.
There are a number of ways we can
deal with this.
Mr. MCCONNELL. I would say to my
friend that the answer here is not just
the money but an actual adjustment of
U.S. law to more directly affect the cri-
sis that we have. We need to do both,
correct?
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I agree
with the majority leader. We do need
to do both.
I would also add, for those who were
disturbed by the President’s invocation
of his tariff authority to try to bring
the Mexican Government to the table
to negotiate some changes in the way
the Mexican Government deals with
this flow of Central Americans coming
across its country, none of that would
have been necessary if our Democratic
colleagues had simply worked with us
both on the underlying legislation and
on this appropriations bill.
Frankly, the President was put in a
corner, and there was not much else he
could do. I am grateful he was able to
get a result. Only time will tell wheth-
er those numbers actually go down
from the 144,000 last month.
But while the Democrats are sitting
on their hands and maybe talking a
good game, I am glad to know we at
least have leadership in the White
House and here in the Senate.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Would it be safe to
characterize this as a situation in
which we are actually getting more co-
operation from the Mexicans than we
are from the Democrats in Congress?
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, that is
a sad but true statement. It is unbe-
lievable to me that the Mexican Gov-
ernment, under President Lopez
Obrador, is doing more than congres-
sional Democrats to try to solve this
humanitarian and security crisis, but
that is where we are.
Mr. MCCONNELL. I would just add
that I hope there is success in the Judi-
ciary Committee to achieve some kind
of bipartisan consensus so that we can
solve the entire problem, not just the
humanitarian crisis.
I thank the Senator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank
the majority leader again for his lead-
ership and for his comments today.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
HYDE-SMITH). Without objection, it is
so ordered.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY
LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The

ELECTIONS
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
last night, President Donald Trump, in
an interview with ABC News, said that
if he were offered information about an
opponent from a foreign source in the
next election, he would take a look at
it and might not go to the FBI.
I think you might want to listen. There
isn’t anything wrong with listening. If some-
one called from a country . . . [and said] ‘‘we
have information on your opponent’’—oh, I
think I’d want to hear it.
That is shocking, shocking—yet,
sadly, is par for the course for this
President.
My predecessor, Senator Moynihan,
said, ‘‘We are defining deviancy down.’’
No President has defined deviancy
down more than Donald Trump, and his
remarks last night defined deviancy
down to a new low.
To say that it is OK for foreign coun-
tries to interfere in our elections, with
their motives not being what are in the
interests of the American people, is
disgraceful, shocking. It is as if the
President has learned absolutely noth-
ing from the past 2 years of investiga-
tions into Russia’s interference of the
2016 elections. This is precisely how the
whole thing started. A foreign power
reached out to establish connections
with a Presidential campaign by dan-
gling the promise of information about
an opponent, and President Trump said
he would welcome it. He asked Russia
to interfere.
When he wonders why people think
there might be collusion, well, this is
why. This is a President who says: Rus-
sia, come help. That doesn’t prove col-
lusion, but it sure proves that he
doesn’t mind foreign powers interfering
with an election.
Again, the President’s comments are
undemocratic, un-American, and dis-
graceful. The President’s comments
suggest he believes winning an election
is more important than the integrity of
an election. That idea is flat-out
wrong. The President’s idea that win-
ning an election is everything and the
integrity of an election is nothing is
one small step away from dictators and
autocrats, who manipulate the results
of an election because they care more
about staying in power than they care
about democratic principles. Donald
Trump seems to fall into that category
in which winning is everything and in-
tegrity is nothing.
It is simple. When a foreign power
tries to give a campaign information
on an opponent, that is foreign inter-
ference in our elections. It is exactly
what the Framers worried about at the
very founding of our Republic.
It is up to us in Congress to protect
that legacy, the wellspring of democ-
racy—free and fair elections. It is up to
all of us in Congress—Democrats and
Republicans. When a foreign power
interferes in our elections, the Demo-
crats shouldn’t say ‘‘If it helps our
side, we are OK with it,’’ and the Re-
publicans shouldn’t say ‘‘If it helps our
side, we are OK with it.’’
Where are the Republicans going to
be with this latest step over the line by
Donald Trump? Are they going to sit
and cower and do nothing?
We have multiple bipartisan elec-
tions security bills that are just lan-
guishing here in the Senate. We even

S3454 June 13, 2019
have a bill that has been introduced by
the ranking member of the Intelligence
Committee that would make it a cam-
paign’s legal duty to report to the FBI
when a foreign power offers its assist-
ance.
It is very simple. If a foreign power
comes to your campaign and offers as-
sistance, you tell the FBI. This would
say you are required to by law. It is
Senator WARNER’s bill. Are our Repub-
lican colleagues going to be with us on
that? We will find out shortly because
later this afternoon, my friend Senator
WARNER will ask our colleagues for the
unanimous consent to pass his bill that
says: If Russia, Iran, North Korea, or
anyone else offers campaign help, you
must report it to the FBI ASAP.
My Republican friends should take a
few hours to decide if they really want
to block that bill, because if they do, it
would be a disgrace and another step in
defining deviancy down in this grand
democracy that is becoming more and
more at risk.
The Republican blockade of elections
security thus far, led by Leader
MCCONNELL, has to come to an end. Bi-
partisan elections security bills are
languishing because Leader MCCON-
NELL will not bring them to the floor.
One of his own colleagues, the chair-
man of the Rules and Administration
Committee, said we are not bringing
them to the floor because Leader
MCCONNELL doesn’t want to. He stands
in the way, with his graveyard, on an
issue that is vital to American integ-
rity, American democracy. Leader
MCCONNELL needs to bring these bills
to the floor.
Again, I ask our Republicans to
think hard as Senator WARNER asks for
his unanimous consent request later
this morning or this afternoon. Are
you going to say it is OK when a for-
eign power goes to you or to any other
candidate or a sitting President and
says, ‘‘We will help you win the elec-
tion—shhh—and we will help you to be
quiet about it and not to tell law en-
forcement’’? I hope not.
The embrace of our Republican col-
leagues of everything Donald Trump
does, including things they know are
wrong, has become stunning and ap-
palling. Let’s see, in this instance, if it
gets even worse.
f
TAXES
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on
taxes, a year and a half ago, as the
Senate debated the Republican tax bill,
the Democrats predicted that giving
enormous tax breaks to big corpora-
tions and the superrich would not
trickle down to working Americans.
We predicted then, as usual, that cor-
porations would find a way to direct
those newfound profits to themselves,
not to their workers, not to their com-
munities, and not for the good of the
country.
Our Republican colleagues protested.
They said trickle-down works. They
talked about tax cuts. They tried to de-
liberately avoid who they were design-
ing the tax cuts to benefit, but it was
largely the very wealthy and the very
powerful corporations. They said it was
going to benefit everybody.
Well, here we go. The analyses keep
pouring in of what a sham—a dis-
grace—this tax bill was, especially for
middle-class, average Americans.
An analysis by JUST Capital showed
yesterday that 56 percent of the tax
savings from the Trump tax bill have
gone to shareholders in the form of
stock buybacks and direct distribu-
tions—56 percent, a majority. Do you
know how much workers got? While
the shareholders—most of them
wealthy—got 56 percent, workers got 6
percent of the whole benefit of the tax
bill. This was by JUST Capital, which
is not a leftwing group; it is a group
that is composed of people who know
all about and participate in corpora-
tions and finance.
If you don’t believe that one, this
morning, the Business Roundtable,
which is made up of the 200 largest
CEOs in America—hardly a leftwing,
radical group—reported that America’s
CEOs expect to spend less on capital in-
vestments now than before the tax bill
was passed.
So this idea of giving these compa-
nies big tax breaks so they will rein-
vest them is not happening. They are
going to buybacks. This is not dealing
with the No. 1 problem that America
faces—the maldistribution of wealth
and income as it agglomerates to the
top and the middle class and those try-
ing to get into the middle class being
left out.
I remember when President Trump
promised his tax bill would be a ‘‘mid-
dle class miracle’’—his words—and that
the average American family would see
a $4,000 raise. I remember when many
of my Republican friends came to the
floor to tout workers’ bonuses in the
wake of their tax bill even though
many of them were merely your typ-
ical annual bonuses. It turns out, as to
yesterday’s report, that 2 percent—just
2 percent—of the tax bill’s overall
windfall went to workers’ bonuses,
which is an average of a measly $28 per
worker, while their corporate parents
and their larger shareholders got hun-
dreds of thousands and millions.
Several of my Republican colleagues
still laud the tax bill. They try to link
it to positive economic news, but you
will never hear them mention that
most of the bill’s benefits flowed to
multinational corporations and to the
top 1 percent of America. You won’t
hear them mention that it did very lit-
tle to raise wages for average Ameri-
cans. Alas, the Republicans are giving
themselves credit for building a theme
park for everyone when all they have
done is renovate the exclusive country
club.
As many Democrats predicted, a year
and a half after its passage, the Repub-
lican tax bill has overwhelmingly bene-
fited shareholders and corporate execu-
tives but not workers and their fami-
lies.
HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES
SENIOR CHIEF PETTY OFFICER
SHANNON KENT
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
now, on a very important topic that af-
fects New York and America, there is
the renaming of a ship.
The men and women who wear this
Nation’s uniform are some of the most
inspiring people you will ever meet.
There is no shortage of stories of their
valor, of their courage under fire, or of
their sacrifices made voluntarily on be-
half of a grateful nation. Yet I have the
responsibility and the honor this morn-
ing of sharing the story of a particu-
larly exceptional servicemember from
my State of New York, SCPO Shannon
Kent.
Shannon Kent was from Upstate New
York. She was born in Oswego and was
raised in Pine Plains. She graduated
from Stissing Mountain High School
and left college to join the Navy, fol-
lowing in the footsteps of her father
and her uncle—a police commander and
a firefighter—both of whom were first
responders on September 11. Duty ran
in the veins of the Kent family.
Shannon was a pioneer in the special
operations community. She was one of
the first, if not the first woman to pass
the course required to join Navy
SEALs on missions. That is amazing in
itself. Shannon was an outstanding lin-
guist and a seasoned cryptologist,
whose work ‘‘contributed directly to
the capture of hundreds of enemy in-
surgents and severely degraded enemy
combat capability,’’ which earned her a
slew of accolades, including multiple
commendation medals—the Purple
Heart and the Bronze Star.
What an amazing woman—brave,
strong, brilliant, and with a large body
of knowledge. Amazing. Her coura-
geous efforts and groundbreaking
achievements have inspired numerous
programs for integrating women into
the special operations forces, with
there being combat jobs and special op-
erations training now open to female
servicemembers. Senior Chief Kent was
living proof that women could not only
keep up with but lead our Nation’s
most highly trained and capable serv-
icemembers.
Of course, Shannon was more than
just a sailor; she was a loving wife to
her husband, Joe, a caring mother to
her two children, a cancer survivor, a
scholar, and an unstoppable athlete
who stayed true to her New York roots,
often going out for runs in her faded
New York Yankees cap.
On January 16 of this year, SCPO
Shannon Kent was among four Ameri-
cans and more than a dozen others who
were killed in a suicide bombing in
northern Syria.
Senior Chief Kent was on her fifth
combat deployment, once again con-
ducting some of the Nation’s most clas-
sified and dangerous missions. After
her tragic death, one of her com-
manding officers said: ‘‘Senior Chief

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3455
June 13, 2019
Petty Officer Shannon Kent deserves to
be honored in a manner befitting of her
noble service to our country and endur-
ing contributions to the United States
Navy.’’
I could not agree more. So, today, I
am proud to introduce an amendment
to the annual Defense authorization
bill urging the U.S. Navy to name a
ship after New York native and Amer-
ican hero, SCPO Shannon Kent.
Of the 289 Active-Duty ships in the
Navy, only five—only five—are named
in honor of women. Of the 53 named
vessels currently under construction,
only one—just one—is named in honor
of a woman. And no Navy ship has ever
been named for a woman who fought
and died in combat as Shannon Kent
did.
It is time to address this disparity,
recognizing the integral role that fe-
male servicemembers play in pro-
tecting our great Nation. RADM Grace
Hopper, the namesake of the USS Hop-
per, once said:
A ship in port is safe; but that is not what
ships are built for. Sail out to sea and do new
things.
That is what RADM Grace Hopper
said.
Well, SCPO Shannon Kent was built
to set out to sea to do good things. So
should we. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port my amendment to name the first
naval vessel after a woman who has
fought and died in combat, the brave,
patriotic, wonderful Shannon Kent.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator
from Oklahoma.
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I
have heard from other sources about
Shannon Kent, to whom he is referring,
and she is in fact an American hero.
Everything he said about her is very
true; however, everything he said
about our President is not very true.
Here we are, with probably the best
economy we have had in my life—
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
will my colleague kindly yield the
floor before I leave?
I agree with the first half of his sen-
tence.
JOINT RESOLUTION OF DISAPPROVAL
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I
just want to comment that every time
I hear things about the President—you
have to keep in mind that we have the
best economy we have had. Unemploy-
ment is at 4 percent. We are better
than we have ever been.
We went through 8 years with the
Obama administration taking down our
military to the point where we allowed
Russia and China to get ahead of us in
many areas, such as hypersonics, and
now we are going into this thing with
a Defense authorization bill. But it is
this President who is changing—trying
to overcome the problems.
I don’t criticize President Obama be-
cause he was really feeling where his
priorities should be, and they have not
been to defend America. He set up this
system that says for every dollar that
you put into the military, you have to
put a dollar into nonmilitary, and that
is just not what we are supposed to be
doing in this country.
So we are going to get to the point at
which the American people are going
to be very proud that we are going to
have systems, we are going to have
weaponry, we are going to be back to
where we used to be and we have been
since World War II—having the best
equipment, treating our people the
best, having the best troops. We al-
ready have the best troops in the field.
We need to do for them what they are
doing for us. That is what this bill is
all about.
Again, this President has been very
supportive in rebuilding the military.
Look at the court system. Right now
we have great new jurists. We are up to
over 40 appellate judges who now have
been confirmed.
So good things are happening. This
President is accountable for these good
things, and I can assure you that the
American people know better than
some of the stuff they hear about
President Trump. It is just not true.
I want to get on record here because
we have some votes coming up having
to do with the joint resolution of dis-
approval regarding arms sales to Bah-
rain and Qatar.
These two Arabian Peninsula states
are important to the American part-
ners in countering Iran and combating
ISIS and other terrorist groups. We de-
pend on them. They are our friends.
Bahrain actually hosts about 7,000
U.S. personnel, and that would be in
the U.S. Fifth Fleet.
Qatar hosts about 10,000 U.S. per-
sonnel, as well as the Combined Air Op-
erations Center at Al Udeid Air Base.
Through these arms sales, we can im-
prove cooperation, enhance interoper-
ability, and help our partners defend
themselves and our American troops in
the region. They are defending them-
selves. They are defending our Amer-
ican troops who are over there right
now. I really get concerned when
things like this come up. What is the
rest of the world to say when we treat
our allies this way and we renege on a
commitment that we made?
Through these arms sales, we can im-
prove cooperation and we can improve
our relationships in that whole part of
the world, but, more importantly, if we
renege on these arms sales, we will un-
dermine the national defense strategy.
The ‘‘National Defense Strategy’’ is a
book. I should have brought it down to
hold it up. I normally do when we talk
about it. It is something in which
Democrats and Republicans agree to
get America back on top; this is what
we need to do. Part of this and the rec-
ommendations of the national defense
strategy made up of top Democratic
and Republican leaders in the field of
defending America—they are all in
agreement that we can’t renege on the
commitments that we have made on
these arms sales.
I recall that the top NDS priority is
competing with Russia and China. That
is one of the things that happened dur-
ing the last administration. All of a
sudden we find we have peer competi-
tors. We have China and Russia doing
things right now where they actually
are exhibiting better equipment and
better resources than we are. So we
have to stand by our partners.
Make no mistake about it. If some-
thing happens and they can’t rely on us
for their defensive needs, they are
going to go someplace else. Where will
they go? Will they go to Russia? Will
they go to China? I can assure you, the
main thing that people overlook is
they are going to get the arms from
someplace. They will either get them
from us or they will get them from
Russia and China.
I have to ask my colleagues who sup-
port this resolution, do you expect
Russia and China to ensure the free-
dom of navigation in the Middle East
against Iranian threats? Will Russia
and China lead a coalition to defeat
ISIS? No. You know better than that.
Will Russia and China deter Iran
from attacking our partners and troops
in this region?
I understand that my colleagues have
concerns about Saudi Arabia’s terrible
human rights record. I agree. I am of-
fended by that. This is a different issue
altogether. This is an issue of whether
we are going to keep our commitment
to our allies in that very sensitive re-
gion where we need more allies. Or are
we going to renege on our commit-
ments to them? Keep in mind, they are
going to get them anyway.
I know that some of my colleagues
disagree with the administration’s re-
cent emergency declaration regarding
arms sales to Saudi Arabia, but the
leadership has assured me that we will
have a vote on Saudi Arabia, so I urge
my colleagues to raise their concerns
about this at that time. That is the ap-
propriate time to bring this up.
More to the point, I urge them not to
punish Bahrain and Qatar inappropri-
ately and not to undermine U.S. na-
tional security interests in that region.
The bottom line is everyone under-
stands that Bahrain and Qatar are
going to get arms anyway. They are
going to get them either from us or
from those who are our adversaries.
That is why this is so important. I
strongly urge that we defeat these ef-
forts that are out there right now to
try to stop the arms sales that are tak-
ing place now.
I yield the floor.

jority whip.
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, last
week I came to the floor to discuss the
agriculture economy.
While the broader economy is thriv-
ing, our Nation’s farmers and ranchers
are struggling. A combination of low
commodity prices, protracted trade
disputes, natural disasters, and weath-
er-related issues have meant a tough
few years for farmers. Nationwide, net
farm income is about half of what it
was in 2013.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3456 June 13, 2019
One of the biggest things we can do
in Washington to help our Nation’s
farmers and ranchers is to negotiate fa-
vorable trade deals that expand exist-
ing and open new foreign markets for
American agricultural products. That
is why I have been pushing for a speedy
conclusion to the various trade agree-
ments that our country is currently ne-
gotiating.
I strongly support the effort the ad-
ministration has been making to se-
cure more favorable export markets for
American products. We have made real
progress in negotiations. Now we need
to wrap up the various agreements we
are discussing as soon as possible so
that we can get farmers and ranchers
certainty about what international
markets are going to look like.
Of course, there is one agreement
that has already been wrapped up—the
United States-Mexico-Canada Free
Trade Agreement. This is a hugely im-
portant agreement that will boost al-
most every sector of the American
economy, from automotive manufac-
turing to digital services, to dairy
farming. It will create 176,000 new jobs
and increase wages for workers.
Passing this agreement is a big pri-
ority for the ag industry. Mexico and
Canada are huge importers of Amer-
ican agricultural products. The United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will
preserve and expand American farmers’
access to these key markets.
More than 950 food and agriculture
companies and groups sent a letter to
Congress, urging its passage. In my
home State of South Dakota, Mexico
and Canada are the No. 1 and No. 2 cus-
tomers for our agriculture exports.
Maintaining and expanding South Da-
kota farmers’ access to these markets
are critical.
I am particularly pleased with the
improvement that the United States-
Mexico-Canada Agreement makes for
U.S. dairy producers. Dairy is an im-
portant and rapidly growing industry
in South Dakota. If you drive the I–29
corridor north of Brookings, you can
see firsthand the massive dairy expan-
sion that we have experienced in South
Dakota over the past few years.
The United States-Mexico-Canada
Agreement will preserve the U.S. dairy
farmers’ role as a key dairy supplier to
Mexico, and it will substantially ex-
pand market access in Canada, where
U.S. dairy sales have been restricted.
The U.S. International Trade Com-
mission estimates the agreement will
boost U.S. dairy exports by more than
$277 million.
The United States-Mexico-Canada
Agreement also makes targeted im-
provements for U.S. poultry, egg, and
wheat producers. Wheat is another im-
portant South Dakota product, and I
look forward to the boost this agree-
ment will give South Dakota wheat
growers.
As I said earlier, one of the most im-
portant things we can do to help the
struggling agriculture economy is to
negotiate favorable trade agreements
for U.S. producers and open new mar-
kets for American agricultural prod-
ucts. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agree-
ment is ready to go, and Republicans in
Congress are ready to pass it. Now
Speaker PELOSI needs to indicate her
willingness to take up this agreement
in the near future.
This agreement will provide cer-
tainty for American producers and ex-
pand market access for a vast array of
American goods and services. It is a
win for our economy and a win for
American workers. We should pass this
agreement as soon as possible.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas.
JOINT RESOLUTION OF DISAPPROVAL
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I
wanted to speak today about the pro-
posed disapproval of arms sales to our
Gulf partners, Bahrain and Qatar. Last
month, the administration notified
Congress of its intention to sell Apache
helicopters to Qatar. Those helicopters
will help with security and counterter-
rorism patrols, especially ahead of the
2020 World Cup, which, of course, will
be a prime target for terrorists.
We are also scheduled to sell air-de-
fense missiles to Bahrain, where we
have more than 8,500 Americans sta-
tioned in Manama at U.S. Naval Forces
Central Command and the Fifth Fleet.
These sales would also yield more than
$3 billion for America, while making
Americans safer overseas—what you
might call a win-win. By contrast, re-
jecting these arms sales in a fit of
pique would endanger Americans and
weaken American influence in the Per-
sian Gulf at precisely the moment
when we as a Nation are being severely
tested.
Right now, the Iranian regime is en-
gaged in a bloody campaign of terror,
testing our resolve. Earlier this week,
Iran’s proxy on the Arabian Peninsula,
the Houthi rebels in Yemen, launched a
missile attack on a civilian airport in
Saudi Arabia, wounding more than two
dozen civilians, including women and
children. Where did the Houthis get
that missile? Yemen isn’t known for its
defense-industrial base. That missile
came from Iran, as surely as if it were
launched from Iranian soil itself.
In recent weeks, four oil tankers near
the Strait of Hormuz, flying the flags
of our allies and partners—Norway,
Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab
Emirates—were attacked with explo-
sives, in effect, terrorizing all traffic
through that strategic chokepoint.
Public reports indicate that the Ira-
nians perpetrated these attacks. Let’s
just say I am confident it wasn’t the
Swedes settling old grudges against
their Nordic rival.
Just this morning, hours ago, two
tankers were attacked in the Gulf of
Oman, with early indications that the
damage is consistent with a torpedo or
other projectile. While the attack
hasn’t been attributed yet, I think it is
a safe bet that it wasn’t the Omanis.
Let’s not be naive about what is hap-
pening in the Middle East. As Iran’s
economy staggers under the weight of
new American sanctions, the aya-
tollahs are lashing out and raging
against the world. It is essential that
we support our Gulf partners during
this dangerous time so they can defend
themselves from Iranian aggression
and its proxies.
Besides, the arms we sell to Qatar
and Bahrain will also protect all those
Americans and their families in Bah-
rain and Qatar.
But instead of helping Qatar and
Bahrain to confront a common adver-
sary, some of my colleagues want to
hang them out to dry. If we snub our
Gulf partners today, though, there will
be consequences. Our joint efforts to
fight terrorist financing could suffer.
Our pressure campaign against Iran
could also be jeopardized. If we back
away from our partners now, their se-
curity needs will not disappear. There
will just be adversaries swooping in to
support them.
Qatar is already considering a major
arms deal with Russia. Both Qatar and
Bahrain are involved in China’s Belt
and Road Initiative, an attempt by the
Chinese Communist Party to build a
world order with itself at the top. So
what we are debating today isn’t only
whether to help or hurt our Gulf part-
ners. It is also whether to push them
further into the Chinese and Russian
spheres of influence.
I understand that a few of my col-
leagues have qualms about some of the
countries with whom America must
work as a matter of necessity to pro-
tect our security and our interests, but
that is no excuse for rash actions that
would weaken American influence,
threaten Americans overseas, and em-
bolden our adversaries in Tehran, Bei-
jing, and Moscow.
Make no mistake. The ayatollahs,
Vladimir Putin, and Xi Jinping are
watching these votes. For those of you
who are undecided, I suggest you con-
sider how those men would want you to
vote.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

attention among the Members of the
body and the American people. Review-
ing and approving arms sales across
the world is a core function of the Sen-
ate Foreign Relations Committee. It is
an integral exercise of congressional
oversight of the executive branch, and
it is legally mandated.
So as we consider Senator PAUL’s res-
olution today regarding arms sales to
Qatar and Bahrain, I would first like to
make a few points of clarification.
First, the resolutions of disapproval
before us today are completely unre-
lated to the administration’s bogus
‘‘emergency’’ notification of the 22
sales to Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates, as well as the 22 resolu-
tions I filed with a bipartisan group of
Senators in objection to them.
Second, the resolutions before us
today have already gone through the
regular committee process. As is nor-
mal procedure, the administration no-
tified us of these sales. The Senate For-
eign Relations Committee and the
House Foreign Affairs Committee then
conducted our due diligence, after
which we, in fact, agreed with the ad-
ministration that these sales should go
forward.
However, I do support the Senator
from Kentucky’s right to seek full con-
sideration of them by the Senate.
Given the administration’s decision
last month to completely flout con-
gressional review over arms sales, I am
supporting this motion in order to once
again emphasize the importance of
congressional oversight and due dili-
gence.
With that in mind, I appreciate Sen-
ator PAUL’s—as well as Senator GRA-
HAM’s, Senator YOUNG’s, and Senator
LEE’s—cosponsorship of my 22 resolu-
tions of disapproval regarding the ad-
ministration’s so-called emergency
arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the
UAE.
I am glad to know I am not the only
one in this body disturbed by the Presi-
dent’s willingness to bypass Congress
and sell this weaponry without any
consideration of the recent events that
have strained our relationship with
Saudi Arabia, and I certainly look for-
ward to a more robust debate and vote
on those sales next week.
But let me start by saying that I
placed holds on specific sales to Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
over serious, credible concerns that
these weapons were being used to tar-
get civilians. Through the regular re-
view process, I sought answers from
the State Department about how these
sales were promoting our interests and
what steps we were taking to get guar-
antees from the Saudis and the
Emiratis that these weapons were
being used in a way consistent with our
interests, with international humani-
tarian law, and with respect to human
rights.
After the brutal murder of Jamal
Khashoggi, the Department of State
ceased engaging with me on these ques-
tions and did not respond to inquiries
about how these sales were furthering
U.S. interests or about our relationship
with Saudi Arabia. This is unaccept-
able. They could have engaged. They
chose not to.
The bottom line is that we are a co-
equal branch of government, and we
cannot stay silent when any adminis-
tration attempts to override or cir-
cumvent legally mandated oversight
by Congress.
The United States sells a significant
amount of weapons to Gulf countries,
but given the rhetoric and behavior
coming out of the administration, the
last thing we should be doing is weak-
ening our scrutiny over arms sales.
Let’s remember why we pursue these
sales in the first place. Arms sales are
one of our many tools to promote
American foreign policy and military
objectives. We use arms sales to bring
like-minded countries in line with our
goals and to promote interoperability
with American defense systems.
As the ranking member of the For-
eign Relations Committee, I have al-
ways been diligent in reviewing every
arms sale proposed by this administra-
tion, including these sales to Bahrain
and Qatar. Through our standard proc-
ess, I reviewed and cleared these sales
for consideration by the Senate as part
of our normal statutory procedures.
Now, let me turn to the particular
sale to Bahrain, which I believe is in
our interest at this moment. Make no
mistake. I have serious concern about
Bahrain’s human rights record—con-
cerns I have made clear to the Bahrain
Government and to the State Depart-
ment. I will be the first to say that
Bahrain does not have a blank check
for weapons systems from the United
States. However, I am mindful that
Bahrain hosts the U.S. Navy’s Fifth
Fleet. This package of upgraded F–16s
and related munitions will help Bah-
rain effectively defend its territory, in-
cluding U.S. Naval facilities, as well as
participate in multinational efforts
like the former coalition against ISIS
in Syria.
Now, regarding the other resolution
concerning Qatar, I note that Qatar has
requested additional attack helicopters
to fill its operational requirements, in-
cluding enhancing their long-term de-
fensive and offensive capability and the
ability to protect key oil and gas infra-
structure and platforms important to
the United States and Western eco-
nomic interests. Qatar faces threats
from everywhere, not the least of
which is Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
Finally, I would note that Qatar con-
tinues to host U.S. Armed Forces at Al
Udeid Air Base, providing critical sup-
port to U.S. national security capabili-
ties in the region.
So while I support the Senator from
Kentucky’s rights to have these resolu-
tions considered, it is for these reasons
that I will ultimately support the sale
to Qatar and Bahrain, as will most of
my colleagues.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky.
MOTION TO DISCHARGE—S.J. RES.
20 AND S.J. RES. 26
Mr. PAUL. Under the previous order,
and pursuant to the Arms Export Con-
trol Act of 1976, I move to discharge
the Foreign Relations Committee from
further consideration of S.J. Res. 20
and S.J. Res. 26, relating to the dis-
approval of the proposed foreign mili-
tary sale to the Governments of Bah-
rain and Qatar.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mo-
tions are now pending and will be de-
bated concurrently until the hour of
11:30 a.m., with 7 minutes each reserved
for the chairman and the ranking
member.
Mr. PAUL. Madam President, the
Middle East is a hot caldron, con-
tinuing and continually threatening to
boil over. I think it is a mistake to fun-
nel arms into these century-old con-
flicts.
There is no great certainty that the
arms we send into the Middle East
aren’t one day used against our own
soldiers. In fact, there is a real threat
that someday our young soldiers will
be sent to fight against the very weap-
ons we send to these so-called allies.
It has happened. In Iran, to this day,
they still have some U.S. weapons that
are left over from the weapons the
United States supplied the Shah. In
Iraq, some of the weapons we gave
them to fight Iran were still there
when we returned to fight Saddam Hus-
sein. In Afghanistan, some of the weap-
ons we gave to the mujahedin to fight
the Russians were still there when we
returned to fight the Taliban. These
weapons have a life of their own. It is
not certain that they will not be used
against us and often have been. Pro-
liferating arms in the midst of chaos is
a recipe for disaster.
It is hard to argue that sending arms
into Libya and Syria has, in any way,
advanced liberty. Dreamers often
longingly speak of a peace plan for the
Middle East. Maybe we should consider
a peace plan that doesn’t include
dumping more arms into a region
aflame with civil unrest, civil war, and
anarchy.
The argument goes that we must arm
anyone who is not Iran. We are told
that, because of Iran’s threat, the
United States must accept selling arms
to anyone who opposes Iran, even bone
saw-wielding countries brazen enough
to kill a dissident in a foreign con-
sulate.
It doesn’t matter how you act, how
you behave, or whom you kill, we will
still give you arms. What would happen
if we just said no? What would happen
if we simply conditioned arms sales on
behavior? Are the Saudis so weak that
Iran will run over them and run over
the whole Middle East without our
arms? Of course not.
The Saudis now spend more on their
military than the Russians. The Saudis
have the third largest amount of mili-
tary spending in the world, only behind
the United States and China. Saudi is
No. 3. Saudi Arabia is spending the

third most on arms of anybody in the
world. The Saudis and their Gulf allies
spend eight times more than Iran.
They are perfectly capable of defending
themselves against Iran.
What are the Saudis doing with all
the weapons we give them? For one,
they are bombing civilians in Yemen.
They have been using our bombs and,
up until recently, they were refueling
their bombers with our planes. We have
no business in the war in Yemen. Con-
gress never voted on it. It is unauthor-
ized, it is unconstitutional, and we
have no business aiding the Saudis in
this massacre.
The Saudis have used these bombs to
bomb a funeral procession. They
wounded over 400 at a funeral proces-
sion—they wounded over 400 and killed
150. The Saudis recently bombed and
killed 40 children on a schoolbus.
The Saudis, with our support, con-
tinue to blockade one of the main ports
of Yemen. As a consequence of this
blockade and the Yemeni civil war, 17
million people live on the edge of star-
vation.
In addition, the Saudis indiscrimi-
nately fed arms into the Syrian civil
war. Even Hillary Clinton admitted
this. In an email from Hillary Clinton
to John Podesta, she wrote: ‘‘We need
to use our diplomatic and more tradi-
tional intelligence assets to bring pres-
sure on the governments of Qatar and
Saudi Arabia, which are providing
clandestine financial and logistic sup-
port to Isis.’’
Does anybody remember? We went to
war with ISIS because of their horren-
dous violence and killing of civilians.
We had to go back into Syria. Who was
funding ISIS? Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
Why in the world—what sane person
would continue to send arms to coun-
tries that are giving arms to our en-
emies?
I introduced a bill which, unfortu-
nately, will not get a vote today, and
that is to quit arming terrorists. You
say: Well, certainly you are not seri-
ous. Yes, I am serious. We send arms to
terrorists. We send them, and there is a
stopoff point—they stop off in Saudi
Arabia, they stop off in Qatar, they
stop off in Bahrain—but these arms are
winding up in the hands of al-Qaida and
radicals whom we say we are pledged to
defeat and that our soldiers risk life
and limb defending against.
Let’s make sure no one misses this
point. Hillary Clinton admitted that
Qatar and Saudi Arabia were funding
and arming ISIS. How insulting. Our
brave soldiers are sent over there, risk-
ing life and limb, and we are supplying
arms to the enemy.
Hillary Clinton sent another State
Department cable. In this, it read:
‘‘Saudi Arabia remains a critical finan-
cial support base for al-Qaeda, the
Taliban.’’ That is whom we are fighting
in Afghanistan.
So we are fighting al-Qaida every-
where. We are fighting the Taliban in
Afghanistan, and they are being aided
and armed by Saudi Arabia. This is in-
sane. This policy makes no sense at all;
that your dollars are buying weapons
to be thrown into the Middle East to be
spread among who knows whom.
Patrick Cockburn concludes the
emails reveal ‘‘the State Department
and US intelligence clearly had no
doubt that Saudi Arabia and Qatar
were funding Isis.’’
To add insult to injury, there are now
reports that the Saudi-led coalition
that is bombing Yemen are giving
American weapons to al-Qaida-linked
fighters in Yemen, hardline Salafist
militias, and anyone willing to fight
the Houthis.
The problem with Congress is they
are so obsessed with Iran, Iran, Iran
that they can’t understand they are
giving weapons to people who are giv-
ing weapons to enemies of the United
States. Because they so want to com-
bat Iran, they are willing to turn away
and give anybody in the Middle East
anything they want because we say: We
have to stop Iran—when, in reality, the
big power there is Saudi Arabia and the
Gulf sheikdoms.
On the one hand, we are told that al-
Qaida is the enemy that attacked us on
9/11, which they did. On the other hand,
we are told to turn a blind eye and send
more arms to Saudi Arabia and Qatar
that end up winding up in the hands of
al-Qaida and ISIS. It is completely
crazy. What sane person would sell
arms to a regime that kills, tortures,
and imprisons their dissidents? The
Saudis routinely behead and then cru-
cify their opponents.
Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr was executed
and crucified, and his nephew sits on
death row accused of sending text mes-
sages to encourage people to come to a
protest rally. In Saudi Arabia, if you
insult the government or insult the
King, you can be put to death. These
are the people whom this Congress,
this Senate, will shortly vote on send-
ing your weapons to these people. It is
insane. America needs to say: Quit
sending our weapons to crazy people.
Quit sending our weapons to ISIS. Quit
sending our weapons to people who
hate us.
How can this possibly be? Because
people say: Oh, no, Iran. If we don’t
give money to Saudi Arabia, Iran will
take over the world. Saudi Arabia
spends eight times as much on their
military as Iran. There is no danger of
Iran taking over the Middle East with
Saudi Arabia there. There is a great
danger, though, if we keep funneling
arms in there and fueling the arms race
that the powder keg will blow up.
Since the 1980s, the Saudis are esti-
mated to have spent $100 billion export-
ing radical jihadism. This is a crazy
ideology that preaches hatred of Jews,
hatred of Christians, hatred of Hindus,
and hatred of the West in general. This
is whom they want to send weapons to:
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain. They
don’t like us. They take our money,
they take our weapons, but they don’t
like us. They don’t like Christians.
They don’t like Jews. They don’t like
Hindus.
The Saudis fund tens of thousands of
madrassas. Madrassas are religious
schools that teach the radical form of
jihadism that Saudi Arabia supports.
There used to be a couple hundred in
Pakistan. There are now tens of thou-
sands of madrassas in Pakistan. At one
particular madrassa, 80 percent of the
students join the Taliban when they
leave school.
Why in the world would we send arms
to a country like Saudi Arabia that is
funding madrassas that are sending
soldiers that we have to fight against
in Afghanistan? What kind of bizarre
world do we live in that we are arming
people who arm our enemies?
It has also been reported that the ad-
ministration wants to give nuclear
technology to Saudi Arabia. That is ge-
nius. News reports reveal that the ad-
ministration authorized giving U.S. nu-
clear technology to Saudi Arabia
weeks after Jamal Khashoggi’s murder,
weeks after Saudi Arabia was impli-
cated and the CIA actually concluded
that the Crown Prince of the country
was responsible for the bone saw-dis-
membering murder of Jamal
Khashoggi.
The administration says: Well, we
should probably give them nuclear
technology. Well, it is just going to be
for energy purposes. One cannot over-
state the calamity that awaits the
Middle East and perhaps the world if
Saudi Arabia should misuse peaceful
nuclear technology in the pursuit of
nuclear weapons. Without question,
Iran would follow. A Middle East with
three different countries with nuclear
weapons is not something any sane per-
son would want to contemplate.
Today’s vote is not directly about
Saudi Arabia. We will have another
vote next week or in the near future
about selling arms to Saudi Arabia,
but, indirectly, today’s vote is about
the wisdom of proliferating arms in the
Middle East. Today’s vote is specifi-
cally about disapproving U.S. arms
sales to Qatar and to Bahrain.
First, let’s look at Qatar. Is Qatar a
good actor in the Middle East? There
are dozens of reports that U.S. weapons
sold to Qatar wound up in the hands of
al-Nusra. Who is al-Nusra? Al-Nusra is
an al-Qaida-like affiliate of radical
Islamists who hate the United States
and hate Israel and would set up an ex-
treme form of radical Islamist govern-
ment. They are there to win. We didn’t
directly give them weapons, but we
gave weapons to Qatar and Saudi Ara-
bia, which gave weapons to al-Nusra in
the Syrian civil war.
There are also reports that Qatar’s
weapons have been so indiscriminately
distributed throughout the Middle East
that many of these weapons have also
wound up in the hands of ISIS. So al-
Qaida, al-Nusra, and ISIS are getting
weapons from Qatar. Where does Qatar
get the weapons? From the United
States.
The vote today is whether we should
keep sending weapons to Qatar, which
then sends them to our enemies, and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3459
June 13, 2019
then we send our soldiers to the Middle
East to fight against our own weapons.
It is insulting; it is insane; and it needs
to stop.
There are also reports that Qatar has
been linked to support for Hamas. I am
not talking about one report. I am
talking about dozens and dozens and
dozens. Hamas is violently trying to re-
move or obliterate the State of Israel,
our ally, but we are going to give weap-
ons to Qatar, which is giving weapons
to Hamas, which has pledged to dev-
astate Israel. Does that make any
sense at all? Why would we give weap-
ons to Qatar, which gives them to
Hamas, which would attack our ally
Israel? It makes no sense at all.
Former Under Secretary for Ter-
rorism, David Cohen, writes: Qatar, a
longtime U.S. ally, has for many years
openly financed Hamas. Cohen also
noted that Qatar allows fundraisers to
solicit donations for al-Qaida and ISIS
within Qatar.
Many sources claim that Qatar has
also provided safe haven for al-Qaida
leadership. Qatar is so distrusted that
even the bone saw-wielding Saudis
think it is unwise to sell arms to
Qatar. The Saudis, no stranger to ter-
rorism, cut diplomatic relations with
Qatar over allegations that Qatar was
supporting terrorism. They both have
supported terrorism, and now Saudi
Arabia is saying: Qatar is even worse
than we are. We are bad. We give arms
to terrorists. Sure we do, yes, but
Qatar is even worse, so we are not
going to give any arms to Qatar be-
cause Qatar is giving them to even
worse people than we give them to.
In the chaotic aftermath of the over-
throw of Qadhafi in Libya, there is
civil war, there is chaos, and it is a
breeding ground for terrorism. Qatar
supports the faction opposed to the fac-
tion we support.
It could change next week. But as of
now, we are going to give Qatar weap-
ons today, and they are involved in
Libya on the side opposite of what we
are supporting.
Why would we give weapons to a
country that opposes us in a civil war?
There is a good question as to why we
would be involved in the Libyan civil
war at all and why we ever went over
there to topple their government, but
that is now water under the bridge.
You have this chaos in Libya, where
the United States is supporting one
side and Qatar is supporting the other
side. So why in the world would we
give weapons to people who are oppos-
ing us in an armed conflict?
No one disputes that Qatar has armed
al-Qaida and other radical groups
throughout the Middle East. People
say: Oh, we have a base there. They let
us land. They let us do stuff. So we
need to look the other way and not
care that they continue to support al-
Qaida, ISIS, al-Nusra, and other radical
elements throughout the Middle East.
How much of a risk is it to sell arms
to Qatar? Only time will tell. How
much of a risk is it that in the future
our soldiers may fight against U.S.
weapons that Qatar passes along to ex-
tremists? I think that is a very real
risk. It has already happened, and it
will continue to happen. If you do not
condition armed sales on behavior,
they will not change their behavior.
Some say: Oh, we have to do this. We
have to have a base there. We have to
do it.
They say that particularly with Bah-
rain. Bahrain is an island nation, a
small nation. We have a big Navy pres-
ence there and thousands of sailors
there. So they say: Well, it is our naval
base. It is a stopping port. We need this
naval base, so we are going to look the
other way.
We look the other way for a country
that is ruled by a monarchy composed
of a minority. The Shia population,
which is a form of Islam, is about 70
percent of the public. Twenty-five,
thirty percent is Sunni, and that is the
monarchy. If you are Shia, and you ob-
ject to the government or you criticize
the government, guess what—you are
imprisoned.
There are currently 4,000 political
prisoners in Bahrain. Bahrain bans any
political opposition. One opposition
leader, Sheikh Ali Salman, is in prison
for life for speaking out against the
government. Student leader Moosa
Abdulla Moosa Jaafar was sentenced to
death for protesting against govern-
ment policy. Nabeel Rajab was given 5
years in prison for exposing and
tweeting about torture in Bahraini
prisons. Famous Bahraini football
player Hakeem al-Araibi was arrested
on his honeymoon in Thailand and held
for 76 days by the Bahraini Govern-
ment. In January of this year, the
prominent Shia cleric, Sayed Majeed
Al Meshaal, was arrested for criticizing
extrajudicial killings by the Bahraini
Government.
Should we be sending offensive weap-
ons to a regime that uses violence to
quell political dissent? Should we be
funding a regime that is currently in-
volved with the Saudis in bombing ci-
vilians in Yemen? Should we send of-
fensive weapons to a country that has
been indiscriminately killing civilians
in Yemen? Should we send offensive
weapons to a regime that tortures and
unjustly imprisons and outlaws its po-
litical opponents?
The weapons that this Congress will
send to Bahrain, to this minority mon-
archy, to this authoritarian govern-
ment may someday wind up in the
hands of revolutionaries. How long will
it be until the powder keg of Bahrain
has its own revolution?
We did this in Iran. We sent them to
a ruler who didn’t represent the major-
ity in Iran, the Shah. We did it for a
long time. But in the end, from the
backlash that came in Iran and the
downfall of the Shah, our weapons fell
into the hands of people who hate our
country. The same could happen in any
one of these powder keg countries in
the Middle East. The weapons we send
to Bahrain today may well be in the
hands of revolutionaries in the near fu-
ture.
The facts are not contested. Saudi
Arabia, Qatar, and Bahrain have all al-
lowed U.S. weapons to be funneled to
radical Islamist groups throughout the
Middle East. Dumping more weapons
into the Middle East will not get us
any closer to peace.
A ‘‘yes’’ vote today is a vote for san-
ity. A ‘‘yes’’ vote is a vote to quit send-
ing arms to people who abuse human
rights. A ‘‘yes’’ vote today is a vote
against aiding and abetting the Saudi-
led war in Yemen. A ‘‘yes’’ vote today
is finally a vote for restoring
Congress’s proper role as a check on
Executive power.
Our Founding Fathers were wary of
granting any President too much
power. James Madison wrote that the
executive is the branch most prone to
war. Therefore, the Constitution, with
studied care, granted that power—the
power to declare war—to Congress and
not the President. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote
today to help restore a semblance of
the separation of powers that is nec-
essary to preserve our great Republic.
Thank you.
I yield back my time.

REMEMBERING JEANNETTE RANKIN
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, last
week, we celebrated the 100th anniver-
sary of Congress passing the 19th
Amendment. This week, coincidentally
enough, we celebrate the birthday of
the only woman to vote on the 19th
Amendment, Montana’s own Jeannette
Rankin.
Jeannette Rankin, who helped
women in Montana and Washington,
earned the right to vote in 1914, 3 years
before she became the first woman
elected to Congress and 5 years before
she helped pass the 19th Amendment,
making her the only woman to vote for
nationwide women’s suffrage.
I say ‘‘nationwide’’ because before
Congress passed the 19th Amendment,
women had already won the right to
vote in more than a dozen States, al-
most all of which were west of the Mis-
sissippi. And that was no accident.
The demands of frontier life were
such that men and women often had to
work side by side in order to meet
those demands, and they still do that
today. So it is no surprise that it was
a western woman who led the effort on
the House floor to pass a constitutional
amendment granting women the right
to vote.
As a freshman Member of the minor-
ity party, Rankin was denied the chair-
manship of the newly established
Woman Suffrage Committee, but she
was named ranking member. The group
went to work drafting a women’s suf-
frage amendment on the morning of
January 10, 1918. The Capitol was
crowded with people to hopefully se-
cure a seat in the House Gallery for the
suffrage debate. Rankin opened the de-
bate with an impassioned speech that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3460 June 13, 2019
helped convince her colleagues in the
House to pass the amendment. It was
passed by the thinnest possible margin.
Unfortunately, the Senate failed to
pass that amendment in that Congress,
but Rankin’s victory in the House
marked a major milestone in the suf-
frage movement and laid the ground-
work for the 19th Amendment’s pas-
sage just 18 months later.
Today, in honor of her birthday on
Tuesday and the suffrage centennial
this past week, I would like to read an
excerpt from that impassioned speech
that Representative Rankin gave on
the House floor more than 100 years
ago.
Today, as never before, the Nation needs
its women—needs the work of their hands
and their hearts and their minds. Their en-
ergy must be utilized in the most effective
service they can give.
Are we now going to refuse these women
the opportunity to serve in the face of their
plea—in the face of the Nation’s great need?
Deep down in the hearts of the American
people is a living faith in democracy.
Sometimes it is not expressed in the most
effective way. Sometimes it seems almost
forgotten.
But when the test comes, we find it is still
there, groping and aspiring, and helping men
and women to understand each other and
their common need.
It is our national religion, and it prompts
in us the desire for that measure of justice,
which is based on equal opportunity, equal
protection, equal freedom for all.
This proposed amendment should be passed
as an act of right and justice to the women
of America.
To my mind, this is one of the most impor-
tant questions that has been presented to
Congress since I have been a member.
One that has far more wide-reaching effect
upon the people of the country—insofar as
what the country stands for and what we
stand for—than any other question since the
writing of the Declaration of Independence
and the adoption of our Constitution.
These are the people who are resting their
faith in the Congress of the United States be-
cause they believe Congress knows what de-
mocracy means.
Can we afford to allow these men and
women to doubt for a single instant the sin-
cerity of our protestations of democracy?
How shall we answer their challenge, gen-
tleman? How shall we explain to them the
meaning of democracy if the same Congress
that voted for war to make the world safe for
democracy refuses to give this small meas-
ure of democracy to the women of our coun-
try?
I yield the floor.

BLUE WATER NAVY VIETNAM VETERANS ACT OF
2019
Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am
delighted to join Senator TESTER on
the floor as ranking member of the
Veterans’ Committee, and he and I as
chairman have worked together on
many, many issues. And today, we are
glad to come to the floor and tell the
Senate how much we appreciate what
they did last night in letting the unan-
imous consent motion pass to see to it
that the blue water Navy legislation
that we worked on for so many years
became effective.
I could take a long time explaining
it, but basically it is very simple.
Those who served in Vietnam and rep-
resented our country on the battle-
fields and at sea have been divided on
the benefits they got for their service.
Blue water Navy folks did not get serv-
ice because it was not contemplated
that they would have Agent Orange ex-
posure by being on a ship, whereas our
veterans who were on the ground got
benefits because they were on the
ground, and it was assumed that they
did get exposure to Agent Orange.
The fact of the matter is, sailors on
the ships could have been exposed to
Agent Orange. So the veterans on our
ships were really as equal in their op-
portunity to have gotten exposed to
Agent Orange, so they should be equal-
ly open to getting the benefit.
Because of Senator TESTER’s work,
the testament and work of every mem-
ber, the committee—I can’t name any-
body who didn’t work on it at one time
or another. Some negative, some posi-
tively—but all positive in the end be-
cause we were unanimous.
We passed blue water Navy and put
to bed issues that affected our veterans
for a number of years.
I just want to thank Senator TESTER
immensely for his efforts, particularly
in the end of last year we had a real
battle to get it passed. We thought we
had it passed, but we didn’t at the last
minute. It ended up in court and fi-
nally got a judge to rule our way and
the veterans’ way, and yesterday the
Senate—by unanimously adopting the
House bill which passed a month ago,
the Blue Water Navy benefits are now
available.
So I want to thank Senator TESTER,
Senator BLUMENTHAL on the other side,
Senator MURRAY just did a great job.
On our side, Senator BOOZMAN did a
great job. The ranking member on our
side who is sitting next to me, Senator
MORAN, did a great job.
Importantly, I want to talk about
the staff for just a minute. Adam Reece
is our new executive director of my
staff. He has just done a great job to
get this through.
From my staff, Amanda Maddox has
worked hard to make it happen.
Annabell McWherter, Jillian Workman,
and Pat McGuigan did extraordinary
work to see to it we got this done at
the last minute and got it through.
So, on behalf of all the staff—for all
the staff, minority and majority—on
behalf of our veterans who risked their
lives every day and a day or two after
D-day when I happened to be with the
President at Normandy to see the reen-
actment of that jump, it warms my
heart to know that the Senate today is
memorializing benefits that were in-
tended a long time ago to go to those
veterans who now will get it.
I thank everybody who worked on it,
and I am encouraged by the positive
vote.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana.
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, first of
all, it is indeed a pleasure to be on the
Senate floor with the chairman of the
VA Committee, Senator JOHNNY ISAK-
SON. I think we all know we wouldn’t
be talking about the blue water Navy
legislation, the Blue Water Navy Viet-
nam Veterans Act, without JOHNNY
ISAKSON.
JOHNNY has been an incredible leader
on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee since he took it over, and I
can’t thank him enough for what he
has done to make this a reality. It has
been a long time coming. If there is
anybody that deserves this to happen,
it is the folks who served in Vietnam.
Quite frankly, the sacrifice that they
made during that war was like all
other wars, and it was pretty darn in-
credible.
This victory is for the folks who were
exposed to Agent Orange, and Agent
Orange, by the way, is a herbicide that
was not handled properly, and, quite
frankly, causes real problems, and it
has shown now that it causes real prob-
lems among the men and women who
handled it, who were sprayed by it, who
drank it, and who were exposed to it.
So it is long past time that we deal
with those folks in a way that meets
their needs because of their sacrifice
supporting that war.
I would just say that I come to the
floor a lot, and I am disappointed in
the U.S. Senate almost every day be-
cause they don’t do what they need to
do as far as checks and balances in this
country. But today I come and I say
thank you to the U.S. Senate. Thank
you to the folks who didn’t put a hold
on this bill, who were able to push it
through, because, quite frankly, this
rights a wrong that has been per-
petrated by a government that has ig-
nored them for far too long.
Very quickly, since we do have the
time, I just want to go through what
this bill does. It ensures that veterans
who served just off the shores of Viet-
nam are presumed to have been ex-
posed to Agent Orange, just like those
who served on land. The fact is that
they were exposed. The fact is that now
this bill recognizes that.
It restores VA benefits to literally
tens of thousands of blue water Navy
veterans who had their disability eligi-
bility taken away back in 2002. It re-
quires the VA to contact veterans who
filed denied claims and who are now el-
igible for retroactive benefits. That
means that for those folks who had
their benefits taken away, the VA now
needs to contact them and say: Look,
the playing field has changed.
It extends presumption of Agent Or-
ange exposure to veterans who served
along the Korean DMZ, something we
don’t talk about much, and it expands
benefits to include children born with
spina bifida due to a parent’s exposure
in Thailand.
I have said this many, many times.
Taking care of our veterans is a cost of
war. That is why we need to be very
careful when we send our troops into
battle, because they are exposed phys-
ically and mentally to things that nor-
mal people are never exposed to.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3461
June 13, 2019
For years, I have heard from veterans
who were counting on us to pass the
Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans
Act because, quite frankly, they
weren’t getting the benefits that they
were promised when they signed up.
When they were put in harm’s way, the
country turned their back on them.
They are veterans like Mike Stone
from Kalispell, who served as a blue
water sailor in 1974 and has since been
diagnosed with a variety of illnesses
linked to Agent Orange, like diabetes
and heart disease. Now Mike Stone can
receive the benefits he has earned.
This bill is for Mike and for so many
veterans like him who have waited so
long for the government to deliver.
Once again, under the leadership of
Chairman JOHNNY ISAKSON, we are able
to live up to the commitment to jus-
tice for the blue water Navy veterans
in Montana and across this country
who have sacrificed to keep us safe and
free.
I would urge the President to quickly
sign this bill into law. It is the right
thing to do, and I am proud that the
Senate has finally done it.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho.
MOTION TO DISCHARGE S.J. RES. 20
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, fellow
Senators, today, in a few moments, we
are going to consider S.J. Res. 20,
which is a joint resolution that it pro-
hibits the sales of munitions to Bah-
rain. Actually, we are going to consider
a motion to discharge, and the same is
true of S.J. Res. 26, which is a joint res-
olution that prohibits the issuance of a
letter of offer with respect to the pro-
posed sale to Qatar of 24 helicopters.
I strongly urge my colleagues to con-
sider these sales on their own merits
and to avoid conflating these with un-
related controversies over the adminis-
tration’s recent emergency declara-
tions. They are not related. They are
different matters.
These sales—the two that we are
talking about regarding Bahrain and
Qatar—address the legitimate security
interests of both countries and
strengthen the U.S. partnerships with
both countries and support shared ef-
forts to deter Iran. Congress should
support these sales. The news this
morning of attacks on two more civil-
ian oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman
lend further weight to the conclusion
that our allies and partners in the re-
gion need greater capabilities to share
the burden of defense in support of our
mutual security interests.
The State Department notified these
sales in the standard process, and the
chairs and ranking members of both
House and Senate committees approved
them last month.
The sale to Qatar is not related to
the activities of the Saudi-led coalition
in Yemen. Denying this sale will not
punish Saudi Arabia or influence its
actions in Yemen, as Qatar ceased its
participation in the Saudi-led coalition
in Yemen 2 years ago. I think that is
very important because there is a lot of
discussion up here, as there should be,
regarding the hostilities in Yemen, but
they are not related at all to the mat-
ters we are dealing with today.
Bahrain has not been implicated in
any inappropriate strikes in Yemen
and has focused on defensive oper-
ations, including border security. The
Royal Bahraini Air Force patrols Saudi
Arabia’s borders to counter incursions
from Yemen into Saudi Arabia. Just
this week, we saw how real these
threats are, as a missile from the Ira-
nian-supported Houthis wounded 26 ci-
vilians at a civilian airport. Denying
this sale will not punish Saudi Arabia
or influence its actions in Yemen.
As the ranking member said regard-
ing the resolution brought up last No-
vember, this vote is not Yemen, it is
not Saudi Arabia, and it is not the
UAE. It is Bahrain. Bahrain is a crit-
ical ally to us, and there is absolutely
no question about that. These sales
will help Qatar and Bahrain rightfully
assume the burden of their own defense
and relieve U.S. forces that have been
providing support. The helicopters will
enable the Qataris to provide for their
own defense against threats to its vital
infrastructure. The munitions are crit-
ical for Bahrain’s F–16s and essential
to any plans to defend Bahrain. The
United States has critical and strategic
interests in both of these matters.
In addition to Qatar and Bahrain
taking increasing responsibility for
their own defense, they are taking an
increasingly prominent role in U.S.-led
coalition operations. Importantly,
Qatari fighters conduct joint air pa-
trols with U.S. forces to deter Iran.
Qatar contributes more Naval forces
to coalition patrols of the Arabian Gulf
than any of its neighbors. Qatar C–17s
have moved more than 3 million
pounds of cargo in direct support of co-
alition operations in Syria, Iraq, and
Afghanistan and is expanding its tank-
er fleet to become the No. 2 provider of
coalition air refueling, ahead of the
British.
Bahrain has also contributed to sta-
bility in the region. Bahrain has been
the key mediator in opening relations
between the Gulf Cooperation Council
and Iraq and contributes to counter-
mine, counter-piracy, and intelligence
sharing in support of regional security.
The United States named Bahrain a
major non-NATO ally in 2002, and since
then, they have lived up to that des-
ignation. Bahrain holds 7,000 U.S.
troops in its borders, including the U.S.
Navy’s Fifth Fleet, and it is home to
the only U.S. naval base in the Middle
East.
For its part, Qatar hosts 10,000 U.S.
forces and is home to the regional
headquarters of U.S. forces, including
air and special operations. Qatar pro-
vides access to key logistic nodes and
overflight rights for U.S. aircraft. It
has already invested more than $8 bil-
lion to develop Al Udied Air Base and
is now providing more than $3 billion
to upgrade U.S. facilities there to meet
specific requirements of the United
States. The Qataris are also providing
$200 million a year to sustain these fa-
cilities. Duplicating or recreating the
facilities in Qatar would result in a siz-
able and needless bill to the U.S. tax-
payer.
In recent years, Qatar and Bahrain
have worked to strengthen cooperation
with the United States on countering
the financing of terrorism. As part of
these efforts, Qatar has agreed to in-
crease the sharing of information on
terrorist financiers in the region, to
place greater emphasis on preventing
terrorist financing abuse in the chari-
table and money services business sec-
tors, and develop a domestic designa-
tion regime in line with international
standards. Bahrain, too, is a significant
partner in cutting off terrorist financ-
ing and has assisted in blocking Ira-
nian efforts to circumvent sanctions.
Meanwhile, the credibility of the
United States as a partner of choice is
on the line. If the United States cannot
reliably sell its partners weapons that
are vital for defense, these partners
will turn by necessity to China and
Russia.
The United States recently sent 1,500
more troops into the theater in protec-
tion of U.S. forces. As we ask partners
like Qatar and Bahrain for their sup-
port in protecting their own forces, we
should support them as they seek
greater capabilities to protect them-
selves.
In November, this body concluded
that blocking sales to Bahrain over an
unrelated issue was inappropriate and
did not make sense. I urge my col-
leagues in the strongest possible terms
to reach the same conclusions in this
case.
In closing, these sales should be con-
sidered on their own merits and should
not be entangled with unrelated con-
troversy. These sales address Qatar and
Bahrain’s legitimate security interests,
strengthen U.S. partnership with Qatar
and Bahrain, and, importantly, they
deter Iran.
I support these sales. I urge my col-
leagues to do the same. As we can see
from what I have said here, these sales
are minimal, really, in the overall
scheme of what these countries are
doing to help us. We should show these
countries that indeed we are reliable
partners, we are good friends, and we
deeply appreciate their efforts to pro-
mote the same interests the United
States of America has in the region.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I yield the floor.

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, last
week, we commemorated the 75th anni-
versary of D-Day, and in just a few
weeks, we will celebrate America’s
independence on the Fourth of July.
It is important for us to pause and
remember the contributions made by
the men and women who wear the uni-
form of the U.S. military who fight
every day to protect our freedoms.
The Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee just completed its markup of
the National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 2020 and voted over-
whelmingly to send this legislation to
the Senate floor. This is an annual
event for us in the Senate. We pass the
Defense authorization bill to ensure
that crucial Department of Defense
programs are continued, that Amer-
ica’s servicemembers are paid, and that
our national defense is modernized to
keep pace with the rapidly evolving
threat landscape.
One of my top priorities in the Sen-
ate has been to ensure that America’s
military men and women have what

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3463
June 13, 2019
they need to keep our Nation safe from
threats both at home and abroad, and
this bill, the national defense author-
ization bill, fulfills part of our commit-
ment to do just that.
There are more than 200,000 military
men and women stationed in Texas at
places like Fort Hood, Fort Bliss,
Lackland Air Force Base, Naval Air
Station Corpus Christi, and Ellington
Field. We in Congress have a duty to
provide these men and women with the
training, the tools, and the resources
they need to achieve the most difficult
missions they face today and embark
on those that will inevitably arise to-
morrow.
I have no doubt that these talented
servicemembers could have chosen any
career—certainly one that involved
fewer sacrifices and more time spent at
home with their families—but, instead,
they have chosen to serve their coun-
try. That decision should never stand
in the way of their ability to exercise
one of the most fundamental rights we
have as American citizens, and that is
the right to vote.
In 2016, only 46 percent of Active-
Duty military voted by absentee bal-
lot—46 percent. What concerns me is
the fact that one-third of those who did
not vote said that the absentee voting
process was too complicated. We have
to change that, so I have introduced a
bipartisan bill called the Military
Voter Protection Act that simplifies
the absentee voter registration process
for servicemembers stationed abroad.
It would ensure that within 30 days of
arriving in theater during a deploy-
ment, servicemembers are provided
with a briefing on absentee voting reg-
istration and an opportunity to fill out
the registration form or application.
Currently, 28 States allow the Fed-
eral write-in absentee ballot to serve as
both the registration form and the ac-
tual ballot itself. My bill encourages
the remaining States to follow suit, re-
ducing the amount of paperwork mili-
tary members have to fill out in order
to exercise their right to vote.
This is an important step to simplify
that process for our men and women in
uniform and ensure that arduous and
cumbersome paperwork does not deter
them or dissuade them from casting
their ballot. I have been working with
the chairman and the ranking member
on the Armed Services Committee to
ensure that this provision will be in-
cluded in the Defense authorization bill
for fiscal year 2020 to make it easier for
our servicemembers to make sure their
voices are heard at the ballot box.
As we prepare to consider the De-
fense authorization bill here in the
Senate, I want to thank the men and
women who serve our country and as-
sure them that we will continue to do
everything we can to support them and
ensure they are empowered and mis-
sion-ready and, yes, that they can also
cast their ballot.
TEXAS STORMS
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, like many parts of the country,
Texas has been impacted by severe
weather. Last weekend, parts of my
State were impacted by severe storms,
bringing hail, rain, and winds up to 70
miles per hour. The quick-moving
storms hurled debris and caused exten-
sive and widespread damage. One of the
most devastating scenes was an apart-
ment building that was sliced by a con-
struction crane and took a life.
In the wake of the storm, hundreds of
thousands of North Texans lost their
power, and many of them are still wait-
ing for the lights to come back on. And
if you have been in Texas during June,
you know it is not just your lights you
want; you want your air-conditioning
to run as well. There is never a good
time or circumstance to be without
power, but in Texas, June is far from
ideal.
As many Texans keep working to get
back to some sense of normalcy, I want
to express my gratitude to the first re-
sponders who have been working tire-
lessly to support our communities. I
have immense respect and gratitude for
those who take on these difficult and
sometimes thankless jobs. We need to
tell them every chance we get that we
appreciate the work they do to protect
our communities every day and espe-
cially during times of natural disas-
ters.
Somehow, these challenging times
have a way of bringing communities
closer together and reminding us that
through the hard times, we still have a
lot to be thankful for.
In the wake of these storms, I have
read dozens of stories about friends and
neighbors and kindhearted strangers
helping one another.
There was a man who lived in the
apartment building that was struck by
the crane I mentioned a moment ago
who said he spotted a neighbor trapped
inside his car in the garage, which he
described as ‘‘facing straight down.’’
He and another neighbor said ‘‘We
can’t leave him like that’’ and exposed
themselves to danger to pull the man
through the back window and help him
escape safely.
A neighborhood in East Dallas came
together to help a woman cut and re-
move trees that fell over her home,
saving her a lot of time and money.
Even though the neighborhood is
dealing with widespread power outages,
one person with a generator has kept a
refrigerator on with the community’s
groceries.
I also read about restaurant workers
who helped a woman from Frisco whose
car had been hit by a falling tree.
While the woman and her 3-year-old
niece were able to escape the vehicle,
her friend was trapped inside. The em-
ployees at this restaurant ran into the
storm to help lift the tree so her friend
could escape. They then gave her food,
blankets, and even drove them to a
nearby Target so they could find some
dry clothes.
The restaurant owner downplayed
their actions saying:
I don’t think we really did anything out of
the ordinary that anybody else wouldn’t do.
We were just being good Samaritans.
I am grateful for the Good Samari-
tans across Texas who put themselves
in harm’s way in order to help their
neighbors. As I said earlier, in times of
tragedy or hardship, it is heart-
warming to see stories like these that
remind us of how lucky we are, in
Texas and across the country, to live in
supportive communities.
In closing, I want to thank the first
responders, utility workers, and new-
found friends who have supported one
another through these storms. I will
continue to keep the families of those
killed and injured in my prayers, and I
hope power will soon be fully restored.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I
am on the floor again today to talk
about developing the American work-
force. Why? Because it is such a big
issue back home in Ohio and around
the country.
Pro-growth Federal policies, includ-
ing tax cuts, have really worked. I just
had another group of Ohio small
businesspeople visiting me today, tell-
ing me how they have taken those tax
savings and used them to invest in
their workers, invest in machine and
technology, helping to create more
economic growth. It is working.
The most recent report released by
the Commerce Department shows that
the economy grew by 3.1 percent in the
first quarter this year. That is signifi-
cant. By the way, it is about twice
what was projected for that same quar-
ter prior to tax reform being put into
place. So we are doing about twice as
well as the nonpartisan Congressional
Budget Office thought we would be
doing at this point.
Official unemployment is now 3.6 per-
cent. That is tied for the lowest in 50
years. We continue to see solid wage
growth, including better wage growth—
which is really exciting for me—among
people who are not, as I said, super-
visory employees; in other words, blue-
collar workers, a 3.4-percent increase
in wages. That is after about a decade
and a half of flat wages when you take
inflation into account. Finally, we are
seeing a real increase in wages.
I hear from our small business own-
ers back in Ohio how this is working
for them, but I also hear something
else, which is that they are looking for
workers.
The good news is, the economy is
growing. There is a demand for work-
ers, but that is not the whole story. We
are still seeing a lot of individuals who
are missing out on the benefits of a
growing economy, not working, and
not even looking for work. I have vis-
ited dozens of factories and businesses

S3464 June 13, 2019
over the past year, and I keep hearing
the same thing: We just don’t have
enough skilled workers to fill all the
positions we have in order to keep on
growing, to keep expanding as a com-
pany. Yet, in Ohio and elsewhere, we do
not have enough working-age adults
participating in the labor force.
So how do we solve this problem?
How do we bring this together? How do
we take people off the sidelines and
into work? By the way, I am told it is
over 8 million men right now not work-
ing at all; meaning, they are not look-
ing for work; they don’t show up in the
unemployment numbers. Labor force
economists call this the labor force
participation rate. It is relatively low.
It has fallen in the past decade, mean-
ing there are a lot of unemployed
Americans not even looking for work,
not being recorded in those official De-
partment of Labor unemployment
numbers.
It is so low that if our labor force
participation was simply at its normal
prerecession level—so go back 10 years
and what was normal for decades be-
fore that. If you just went back to that
labor force participation rate, our
country’s unemployment rate would
not be 3.6 percent today. Guess what it
would be. More like 8.3 percent. If we
had an 8.3-percent unemployment num-
ber out there, all of us would be pulling
out our hair thinking, how do we deal
with this? How do we get more people
back to work again? That is essentially
what we have.
Again, of particular concern to me
are those who are of working age, 8
million men, between the ages of 25 and
54, who are not working. We need to
get these people off the sidelines and
back into the workforce, where they
can have the dignity and self-respect
that comes from work and where our
businesses can have their talents. We
need them to have our economy con-
tinue to grow.
To achieve this, I think there are a
number of challenges we have to ad-
dress. First, we do need to focus on
what is called the skills gap. This
skills gap is essentially a mismatch be-
tween the skills in demand today and
the skills our workers have. This labor
force out there that is not finding the
work doesn’t have the skills that are
needed to get the jobs that are avail-
able. It is a widespread issue. It is hold-
ing back our economy from fulfilling
its full potential. In the most recent
skills gap study from 2018, Deloitte and
The Manufacturing Institute high-
lighted this skills gap. The study found
that it may leave an estimated 2.4 mil-
lion positions unfilled between 2018 and
2028, with a potential negative eco-
nomic impact of $2.5 trillion. This
skills gap is real, it is hurting our
economy, and we have to figure out
how to address it in more innovative
ways.
One way to address it is to have more
robust training for the jobs that are
going unfilled. Pretty simple. Often, of
course, these are technical jobs. These
are trade jobs, plumbers, welders, nurs-
ing assistants, IT jobs like coders.
Economists call these jobs middle-
skilled jobs. What they mean by that is
that typically these are the kinds of
jobs that don’t require a college edu-
cation, but they do require some train-
ing after high school. That is what is
really missing right now. That is where
this skills gap can be closed.
The best known training you have
probably heard about for these kinds of
jobs is called career and technical edu-
cation, CTE. For those who are older,
you might think of vocational edu-
cation. CTE programs are doing great
work all over the country.
I have seen this a lot firsthand in
Ohio. I am a big fan of career and tech-
nical education, so I visit our CTE pro-
grams—Butler Tech near Hamilton,
OH, and Max S. Hayes High School in
Cleveland, OH.
I cofounded and cochaired something
here in the Senate called the CTE Cau-
cus, alongside Senator TIM KAINE. We
have meetings here. We have con-
ferences here. We try to encourage
more career and technical education
back home. It is important. But the
training we need goes well beyond
these great high school programs.
Shorter term technical workforce
training programs post-high school are
another key way to help close the
skills gap. Think of the many work-
force training programs that might be
offered in your community college. We
need to encourage more of those.
We need to be sure that the Federal
Government is playing a role here to
hold up career and technical education
generally but also to ensure that these
training programs are given the same
opportunities that we give to 2-year
and 4-year colleges and universities.
One impactful way to close that skills
gap is through Pell grants.
Currently, we use Pell grants to help
expand access to college-level edu-
cation to Americans. You have to meet
the criteria, which is basically an in-
come criteria. For lower income fami-
lies in America, if you want to go to a
4-year college or university and you
otherwise qualify, you can get a Pell
grant to do it—not a loan, a grant.
That is great, but, unbelievably, you
can’t get that same grant if you want
to go to a 15-week, 14-week, 13-week, or
12-week training program to learn how
to be a welder or a coder or a hospital
tech. To me, that makes no sense.
Our bipartisan JOBS Act, which I
cowrote with Senator TIM KAINE, would
allow us to use the Pell grant for these
shorter term job-training programs
with an industry-recognized credential
at the end of the process. That is what
employers are looking for. That is
what these people need, young people
and mid-career people who are looking
for a job. Under current law, you are
eligible for an associate’s or a bach-
elor’s degree but not to enroll in a CTE
program under 15 weeks. It doesn’t
make any sense, and the JOBS Act
would fix that.
By the way, these kinds of workforce
training programs provide students
with academic and technical skills
knowledge and training that are nec-
essary today to fill the 21st-century
jobs we have. They encompass the
kinds of high-quality and rigorous job-
training programs that are easily
transferrable to the in-demand jobs we
have. Whether it is learning HVAC in-
stallation, how to operate factory ma-
chinery—which, by the way, often in-
volves computer skills—or how to be a
programmer or a coder, these programs
teach students the practical, transfer-
able skills that keep our economy mov-
ing.
I have seen firsthand how this can
work in my home State of Ohio. Most
recently in May, I had the opportunity
to deliver the commencement address
at two of our community colleges that
specialize in these types of programs—
Sinclair Community College in Dayton
and Marion Technical College in Mar-
ion County. I was happy to go to these
graduation ceremonies.
First, both schools were great part-
ners in helping us develop the JOBS
Act, and these schools are getting it
done. They are giving students what
they need, the tools they need to be
able to succeed in today’s workforce.
Second, I am always inspired by at-
tending commencements at our com-
munity colleges. At these two colleges,
as an example, I saw individuals as
young as 15 years old walk across the
stage. This one young man was getting
his associate’s degree that he started
at a career and technical education
program in high school before he got
his driver’s license. I also saw individ-
uals as old as 74 years old. I saw the
whole range. And they weren’t just
graduating; they were commencing a
new stage of their lives that will be
filled with opportunity because they
are getting jobs.
That is why the JOBS Act is so im-
portant. It has the potential to help
thousands more students, like the ones
I met at Marion and Sinclair, in gain-
ing the skills necessary to be their best
and to get a job.
(Mr. YOUNG assumed the Chair.)
At the same time, we know that ad-
dressing the skills gap will not fully
solve the challenges we face in raising
our labor participation rates. Another
is overcoming the scourge of addiction
we have seen in Ohio and elsewhere
around the country, from both opioids
and, more recently, crystal meth.
Opioids, prescription drugs, heroin,
and fentanyl have hit us really hard in
Ohio. I see my colleague from Indiana
is here on the floor. He sees the same
thing. It has torn our families apart. It
has devastated our communities. It has
forced a lot of able-bodied adults out of
the workforce while they struggle with
their addiction.
We have begun to make some
progress on this front. After 8 straight
years of rising overdose deaths—8
straight years; every year more people
dying from overdoses, to the point

where we are losing 72,000 Americans a
year—finally, we saw a drop in the last
year. In Ohio, we had a 21.4-percent de-
crease based on a study that was done
by the Centers for Disease Control.
This is the last data we have from the
most recent numbers. We will see. We
expect to have some new numbers soon
for all of 2018. We will see. That is
good. A 21.4-percent decrease is good.
The problem is, it started from such a
high-water mark.
Frankly, what I am hearing this
year, 2019, is that some of these over-
dose rates are increasing in some areas
of Ohio. But we have seen some
progress. Again, according to the stud-
ies that have been done, we are reduc-
ing the overdose deaths, but we still
have so many people who are addicted,
and we still have this issue of how to
get them into the workforce.
The bills we have passed here in the
Congress, like our CARA legislation—
the Comprehensive Addiction and Re-
covery Act—and the Cures legislation,
have really helped. The STOP Act has
helped to try to keep this deadly
fentanyl, which is the opioid that is
killing most people, out of our country.
There is $3 billion in increased funding
that has gone out from this Congress
over the past few years to deal with
education, prevention, treatment,
longer term recovery, and providing
Naloxone—this miracle drug—to re-
verse the effects of an overdose. Those
are good, and we are making some
progress but not enough yet—not
enough. Our work is far from finished.
What I see happening in Ohio is that
as we are making progress on the
opioids, we are seeing crystal meth be-
ginning to increase—pure crystal
meth—methamphetamines coming
from Mexico, across the Mexican bor-
der, into our country. Back in the day,
we had meth labs in Ohio, in Indiana,
and in other States represented in this
Chamber. Those meth labs are pretty
much gone now. People aren’t making
it in their own homes or in commu-
nities in Ohio. Instead, they are buying
it on the street because it is cheaper
and more powerful to buy pure crystal
meth. That is not a good thing. It is a
bad thing because it is indicating that
the crystal meth is spreading.
By the way, these drugs are causing
more law enforcement concerns than
ever because, like cocaine, this is a
stimulant. They call it a
psychostimulant, which creates more
violent crimes and more challenges for
our law enforcement officials.
We have to ensure that we continue
this downward trend in overdose deaths
and address the crystal meth issue,
which I will be talking about more over
the next couple weeks, with some ideas
on crystal meth.
Another factor that undermines our
efforts to develop our workforce is the
increasing number of people with a fel-
ony record. Having a felony record can
be a heavy burden to bear when trying
to find employment. Far too often, we
see the downward spiral that occurs
when inmates are released back into
the community without any kind of job
training, any kind of a way to deal
with their mental health or drug abuse
history or their addiction. So people
find themselves out of a job and then
committing crimes again to get by.
This often goes hand in hand with the
issue of addiction, as so many people
are jailed for nonviolent drug offenses
related to opioids, meth, and other
drugs.
Fortunately, we are making some
progress in getting these individuals
the help and treatment they need,
thanks to some actions we have taken
here at the Federal level as well.
The Second Chance Act, which was
signed into law about a decade ago, is
helping. I was the coauthor of that
back in the House and a coauthor again
this year for the reauthorization of
that legislation. It provides Federal
grant money to State and local entities
to help people, when they get out of
prison, get their lives back together—
again, provide job training in prison, as
they get out of prison; that transi-
tion—and help them deal with issues
they have, including mental health and
addiction.
In so many cases, that has been re-
markably successful in reducing the re-
cidivism rate—the number of people
who go back into the system. Unfortu-
nately, about two-thirds of those who
get out of prison get rearrested within
2 or 3 years.
So there is a great opportunity here,
if you use these programs, to keep
these people out of the system and to
get them back on their feet, back with
their families, and back at work.
Last week, I was able to see firsthand
how groups at the State and local level
are using some of these Federal re-
sources to create strong and effective
pipelines to get individuals off the side-
lines and back into participating in the
workforce.
In Cincinnati, I had the opportunity
to attend a graduation in supply chain
logistics for 11 women incarcerated on
nonviolent drug offenses. These 11
women now have a skill, a tool, to be
able to go out and get a job in this 21st-
century economy we have. In Cin-
cinnati in particular, we have a lot of
supply chain jobs that are available.
They are excited about it.
I also visited one of the companies
where a few of these women are going,
where they hire a lot of second-chance
folks, people who are returning citi-
zens. They have had great success.
These workers are grateful. They show
up on time. They are local. We need
more companies to take that person
who has been down on his or her luck,
gone through a program, and is ready
to work. A lot of these women were re-
peat offenders of low-level crimes, and
they had circulated in and out of pris-
on for years.
This program is run by the Hamilton
County Office of Reentry, which in 2010
was established in part from grant
money from the Second Chance Act we
talked about. Again, in coordination
with local partners, this office of re-
entry has run programs like this that
have given incarcerated individuals a
chance to reenter society and the tools
and support they need for gainful em-
ployment. That is one of the reasons
we have the opportunity out there to
reduce this problem with so many peo-
ple out of work altogether. There is
great potential here to get people back
to work.
In May, I attended a roundtable with
a number of workforce development
nonprofits in Northeast Ohio, Cleve-
land, OH, including the Boy and Girls
Club, Habitat for Humanity, and Youth
Opportunities Unlimited.
Bloom Bakery is an example of an
entity that is taking advantage of
some of these Federal opportunities in
the Second Chance Act. Their parent, a
nonprofit, received a Second Chance
Act grant that allowed them to help
ex-inmates reenter the community.
During their time at Bloom, individ-
uals have a chance to contribute to the
operations of the bakery, learn cul-
inary skills, learn how to bake, learn
how to deal with people, because it is a
retail outlet, and also learn how to be
good in the service industry.
I had the opportunity to meet a num-
ber of these individuals. Ashanique
Johnson was one person I talked to.
She talked about how Bloom was really
a second chance for her, how she in-
tended to use what she was learning
there to find long-term success in the
culinary field.
I also met with TreShon Bankhead.
TreShon is a participant in another
program, one of their sister programs
that train healthcare professionals. He
is currently working at University
Hospitals as a nursing assistant and is
pursuing a degree in nursing. It was
great to see that. Again, it is a second
chance for him.
Meeting them, hearing their life ex-
periences, and seeing what they have
accomplished underscore the need to
continue to provide these opportunities
so they can get ahead in life and so our
economy can have them in the work-
force.
Let me conclude by saying that when
it comes to our economy, more partici-
pation is better for everybody. We want
more people coming out of the side-
lines, coming out of the shadows, and
getting to work.
Let’s make sure all Americans have
the tools they need to go to work and
to find success. Let’s close that skills
gap by doing the career and technical
education programs that we have
talked about but also providing more
help at the Federal level. Rather than
the help going to just colleges and uni-
versities for a degree, let it go to the
short-term training programs so they
get a meaningful certificate and can go
to work right away. Let’s help get the
JOBS Act passed to be able to do that.
Let’s help individuals overcome their
addiction. Let’s help people stay out of
jail and stay with their families and

tools they need to achieve their God-
given potential.
Thank you.
I yield back.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia.
NATIONAL DEBT
Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, the na-
tional debt is what actually pulled me
and you and others, to some degree,
into this political process. I have come
to this floor many times over the last
41⁄2 years to talk about this. Today,
again, it is very timely. It is why I ran
for the U.S. Senate. Today, we have—I
just checked—$22.3 trillion, and it is
going up $100,000 a second, as we speak.
I have a debt clock in the reception
area of my office, in the Russell Senate
Office Building, and that thing spins
all day long, 24 hours a day.
Even more concerning, we have more
than $130 trillion of future unfunded li-
abilities coming at us like a freight
train over the next 30 years. That is $1
million for every household for every
American.
What we have learned is that we
can’t cut our way out of it, we can’t
tax our way out of it, and we can’t
grow our way out of it alone. Any one
of these three will fall short. It has to
be a combination. We have to have a
balanced approach over the long haul
to solve this $22 trillion of debt prob-
lem.
I believe we will not solve this debt
crisis unless and until we fix the way
Congress funds the Federal Govern-
ment. The current funding process is
designed to fail. It really is. It doesn’t
work. It hasn’t worked. It will never
work.
Since the Budget Act of 1974 was put
in place, Congress has only funded the
Federal Government on time four
times. That means that by the end of
the fiscal year, Congress has only fund-
ed the Federal Government four times
by the end of that fiscal year. Let me
say that again. It has been four times
in 45 years since the 1974 Budget Act
was put in place. The last time it was
actually done was in 1996, some 23
years ago, under President Clinton.
Congress is supposed to pass 12 appro-
priations bills to fund the government.
Over the last 45 years, we have aver-
aged just 21⁄2 per year. Because of that,
Congress has used a little known tool
up here called a continuing resolution.
In the last 45 years, Congress has used
a continuing resolution 186 times. It is
a release valve that lets the govern-
ment continue to operate and on the
surface doesn’t really sound that oner-
ous. You just keep spending at the
same level you did last year. The prob-
lem with that is that it is devastating
to some Agencies and, particularly, the
Department of Defense, with regard to
long-term contracts, long-term train-
ing, purchases, and maintenance over
the end of the fiscal year, and so forth.
They are devastating to our military.
They create inefficiencies and uncer-
tainty that hurt the bottom line and
increase our procurement costs by dra-
matic amounts. The end result of that
is that it lowers our readiness, and it
causes the ability to fight to be re-
duced.
In addition, Congress has shut down
the government, over the last 45 years,
21 times because they couldn’t get to-
gether and agree on how to fund the
government that year—21 times.
This funding process, in my opinion,
is an unmitigated disaster, based on
the actual results that have led to $22
trillion of debt today, which, in my
view, is indeed a crisis. Over the last
41⁄2 years alone, we have looked at prac-
tices in States, other countries, and
businesses to find best practices. No
one else in the world funds their oper-
ation the way the U.S. Congress funds
our government.
The problem is, we have a three-step
process. We do a budget, an authoriza-
tion, and then an appropriation. There
simply are not enough days in the year
to get all of those done. It is a 14-week
budget process. We have 16 authorizing
committees. If you did one a week,
that is 16 weeks. And then you have 12
appropriating bills. Even if you did one
a week, which is very hard to do, that
is not enough time in the calendar year
to do that.
Right now, Congress has yet to pass
this year a single appropriations bill
for the next year. This is not the ap-
propriators’ problem. They do their
jobs. They proved that last year and
the year before that. If given enough
time and information, they can get
their job done. The problem is that this
year we have not even agreed with the
House and with the White House on
what the top-line spending should be.
As I stand here today, there are 17
working days until 31 July, when Con-
gress leaves for a State work period
called the August recess. When we get
back, there are only 10 working days
until the end of the fiscal year. That
means we have 27 working days to
reach a budget deal, pass 12 appropria-
tions bills, and bring them to con-
ference and get this government fund-
ed.
If we started today, we would need to
pass an appropriations bill about every
2 days in order to pass all 12 bills by
the end of the fiscal year. We are al-
ready behind, and I am afraid we are
staring down the barrel of another CR
unless we start taking these bills up
immediately.
The minority leader and the majority
leader in the Senate have been working
diligently, along with the appropria-
tions minority leader and chairman of
the appropriations committee. They all
have been working very well to get to
a top-line number with the White
House and the House of Representa-
tives. I am told we are very close to a
deal today. I hope we are.
Last year, when we paid attention to
it, we got to 75 percent funding. But by
31 July, we had only done 12.5 percent
of total government funding. Again,
this is just for the discretionary part of
our spending, which is only about 25
percent of the total spending that we
have in the Federal Government, which
includes mandatory expenses.
Last year, 16 of us wrote a letter to
Leader MCCONNELL, who agreed, and to
his credit, kept us here in August, and
we went from 12 percent to 75 percent
funding by the end of August, including
the Department of Defense and HHS,
two of our biggest line items. By stay-
ing here in August, we did the people’s
work and did something that hadn’t
been done in 22 years.
I hope it doesn’t come to that this
year. It shouldn’t. We have time to do
what we need to do. I know the people
in charge are doing everything they
can to make that happen. That is not
what this conversation is about today.
I am hopeful that even this week we
can get agreement on the topline num-
ber, move past the budget cap issue,
and get to appropriating these bills so
we can avoid any more CRs in our fu-
ture this year.
The unfortunate reality is we have
reached this same predicament almost
every year since 1974. Einstein once
said that ‘‘insanity is doing the same
thing over and over again, but expect-
ing different results.’’ That is what
this Congress has done continually
over the last 45 years, with different
Members and different colleagues. We
keep doing the same thing.
I am convinced more than ever that
we need a politically neutral platform
to fund the government on time every
year without all of this drama. It can
be done. I think both sides want to do
it. Both sides have talked about it
when they were in the minority and
majority at different times, but it is
time to move on it.
Today 25 percent of our budget is dis-
cretionary. That is all. That is defense,
the Veterans’ Administration, and all
domestic discretionary spending. That
is 25 percent. That is what this is all
about. This debate and drama is about
25 percent of the Federal Government.
What is the rest of it? We all know
that is the mandatory expense side of
our budget; 75 percent of what we spend
in the Federal Government, over $3
trillion, is for things like Social Secu-
rity, Medicare, Medicaid, pension and
benefits for Federal employees, and the
interest on the debt. The interest alone
has gone up $450 billion over the last 2
years with nine Fed fund rate in-
creases, and it is projected that by 2023
we will be spending more on the inter-
est alone on this debt than we do on
national defense.
If we borrow about 30 percent of what
we spend, that means, by definition,
every dime we spend on discretionary
spending is borrowed money. What is
discretionary again? Our defense. So
every time we are spending on defense,
it is technically borrowed money.
I believe it is time to fix this, and the
way forward is pretty clear. The way I
see it, there are three things we have
to do to fix this funding process. No. 1,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3467
June 13, 2019
we have to change the budget process
and appropriations process to make it
streamlined, as most States do.
Yesterday I introduced a bill called
the Fix Funding First Act, which I
hope will start a dialogue. It is not the
end result, but I am hopeful it will
start a dialogue here and that we will
be able to work through the details,
take individual items one at a time,
pass some bills, and start moving to-
ward a solution.
Second, we have to address manda-
tory spending. We need to save Social
Security and Medicare.
Third, we need to adjust the current
committee structure so that the same
committees on both sides can both au-
thorize and appropriate.
This is a chart of what we have
today. This is reality. We have on the
left 16 authorizing committees, and on
the right we have 12 appropriating
committees. You can see for one appro-
priating committee you may have five
or six different authorizing committees
that have to provide input, in theory,
to the appropriating committee.
When I came to Congress I was asked
to head the Subcommittee on State De-
partment Oversight inside Foreign Re-
lations. My responsibility was to pro-
vide oversight. Interacting with the
person who was the chair of the sub-
committee in appropriations—we never
talked and there was very little input,
but we found out that the State De-
partment at that time had not been au-
thorized in over 13 years. We changed
that and got it authorized the very
next year. But this is an archaic struc-
ture that will never work. It creates all
of the confusion that we have right
now and the time delays in trying to
get this done.
The Fix Funding First Act I intro-
duced yesterday does five simple
things.
First, it changes the Federal Govern-
ment fiscal year to match the calendar
year. Why is that important? Well, in
the first year of a new Congress we al-
ways start 3 months behind; we start in
the fourth month.
Second, this bill establishes biennial
budgeting. A lot of States do that. It is
not the end-all solution, but it is a
great place to start and will make
things a lot easier here.
Third, this bill makes the budget a
law. Simply put, today the budget is a
resolution.
Fourth, it creates milestones with
consequences to hold us accountable as
a body when we don’t do our jobs.
There are 44 States, including my
State of Georgia, that have a balanced
budget law, and if they don’t pass a
budget by the end of their 44- or 45-day
session, they don’t go home. In most
States that is a law. What we are pro-
posing here is essentially the same
thing. We have broken the appropria-
tions process into four tranches and set
deadlines before Congress’s scheduled
work break. If we don’t make the dead-
line, we don’t go home until we get
that part done. It is just that simple.
Last, our proposal requires the Budg-
et Committee to complete a 5-year
strategic plan—something we have
never done—just as people in the real
world do. This gives us a chance to
start talking about the long-term debt-
to-GDP ratio that my colleague Sen-
ator WHITEHOUSE has been talking
about for the last several years, and I
fully subscribe to what he is trying to
do.
That is what the bill that was intro-
duced this week will do, and I think it
is the first step to fix the funding proc-
ess.
Once we complete the first phase, we
need to tackle mandatory spending,
which is Social Security, Medicare,
Medicaid, and pensions and benefits.
Right now, mandatory spending makes
up about 75 percent of what Congress
spends every year, but costs are ex-
pected to explode over the next 20
years.
The next chart shows the projection
from the Congressional Budget Office,
and these are generally agreed-upon
numbers based upon the baby boomers
maturing in age. What we have is the
green line, total expenses of the Fed-
eral Government, going from just
above $4 trillion today to almost $12
trillion in just 20 years. In 10 years, we
are talking about it being over $8 tril-
lion—almost double what it is today.
These are in constant dollars, not in-
flated dollars. This is our crisis. What
is causing that crisis in the green line
are total expenses.
The blue line is discretionary ex-
penses, which are what we spend most
of our time arguing about here on the
floor of the Senate and the House. But
look at this. This is the mandatory
chart. We go from a moderate one until
we see cataclysmic geometric growth.
We know that the Social Security trust
fund goes to zero in 12 years. The Medi-
care trust fund goes to zero in 7 years.
We have to save these programs and
turn these curves down. There is no
way the world is going to allow us to
borrow that much money. Until Con-
gress works up the political courage to
deal with the mandatory spending
issue, we should make all expenditures
discretionary, bring them under the
budget process when they need to be
subsidized, and that is going to happen
within a few short years.
I believe the answer is very simple.
Even if we pass this bill and the Appro-
priations Committee still has to write
down its own defense authorization, de-
fense bills and so forth, we have to
streamline this process. Last year we
did, and it almost worked. What we
have now is totally dysfunctional.
I hope this proposal that we are put-
ting on the board today will help start
the dialogue about how we can fix this
funding process.
America always does well in a crisis,
but we are not always the first to de-
cide that we are in a crisis. I personally
believe we have been in a crisis for the
last 15 years. Either we can wake up
and face it now or I think we will re-
gret it later.
There are Members on both sides of
the aisle who recognize this crisis. I am
encouraged by the conversations we
are having together. This is not a par-
tisan issue. This is one of those ways
that people back home expect us to
compromise and work together to solve
this.
I am encouraged today. It is time we
did this, and this is the time, this year.
In the next few weeks, hopefully we
will get past this impasse and make it
happen this year.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3470 June 13, 2019
to discharge Senate Joint Resolutions
20 and 26, which sought to block the
sales of certain weapons to Bahrain
and Qatar respectively.
As many of you know, I have long
been a champion of a U.S. foreign pol-
icy driven by our values and respect for
human rights. This applies to our for-
eign military support and arms sales.
We must ensure that our military
might and weapons only go to support
partners and allies who uphold our val-
ues. We have both a moral and a na-
tional security obligation to ensure
that U.S. weapons, equipment, and
training are never used to harm civil-
ians, abuse human rights, or end up in
the hands of enemies who seek to do us
harm.
With that in mind, I was pleased to
lead the Enhancing Human Rights in
Arms Sales Act of 2019 with my col-
leagues from both sides of the aisle.
This bipartisan legislation would put
into place strict vetting criteria and
end use monitoring for certain weapons
sales to prevent U.S.-provided weapons
from going to governments who com-
mit human rights abuses and war
crimes. I urge all of my colleagues to
support this important and necessary
legislation.
Until my bill is enacted into law and
its critical safeguards are in place, it is
incumbent upon Congress to evaluate
each arms sale with important consid-
erations for civilian security and
human rights.
I have carefully examined both of the
sales before us today, and applied the
same criteria outlined in the Enhanc-
ing Human Rights in Arms Sales Act.
Through this lens, I was compelled to
vote in favor of discharging S.J. Res.
20, so the Senate could debate the
pending sale of various bombs and pre-
cision-guided munitions to Bahrain.
Domestically, Bahrain’s Ministry of In-
terior police forces were responsible for
the repression of the 2011 uprising, and
well over 100 Bahrainis have been
killed in the course of repressing the
Shia-led unrest. In the Yemen conflict,
the Bahrain Air Force is participating
in Saudi-led coalition airstrikes that
have led to civilian casualties. This
pending sale would in fact provide mu-
nitions for Bahrain’s F–16 aircraft,
which would almost certainly be used
in Yemen. We know this because Air
Vice Marshall Hamad bin Abdullah al
Khalifah, head of the Royal Bahraini
Air Force—RBAF—stated in February
2019 that Royal Bahraini Air Force F–
16s had conducted over 3,500 sorties, or
combat aircraft flights, since the be-
ginning of the campaign in March 2015.
With 3,500 sorties in Yemen, we have to
assume that Bahrain is responsible for
some of the civilian deaths caused by
the coalition airstrikes in Yemen. I
have repeatedly voiced my opposition
to U.S. support for the war in Yemen,
and we cannot risk our weapons lead-
ing to further repression in Bahrain
itself. I cannot support the sale of U.S.
weapons to Bahrain at this time.
The case of the pending sales to
Qatar is quite different. There is no
doubt that Qatar has significant
human rights challenges, particularly
with respect to its labor practices.
That said, I have not seen any evidence
of the Qatari Government using arms
against its people. Moreover, Qatar’s
involvement in the Yemeni war was
limited to primarily defending the
Saudi border from the Houthis, not
conducting airstrikes in Yemen. The
Qataris left the Saudi-led coalition en-
tirely 2 years ago. Qatar has proven
itself an important and responsible
partner for the United States. The
Qatar Air Force flew strikes, alongside
the U.S. and other partners, against
the Islamic State in Syria in 2014 and
2015. It also flew strikes against Qa-
dhafi in Libya in 2011, but again, this
was in concert with international part-
ners including the United States. In
light of these factors, I voted against
discharging S.J. Res. 26.
While both discharge motions failed,
this issue will not go away because one
thing that we all can agree on is that
no U.S. arms should ever be linked to
the deaths of innocent civilians. No
U.S. arms should ever be used to in-
timidate and destroy the defenseless.
No U.S. arms should ever end up in the
hands a child soldier or a terrorist. We
may disagree on policy, but our values
will always bridge the partisan divide.
That is why Congress and the adminis-
tration must take a more holistic look
at this issue. My bipartisan bill, the
Enhancing Human Rights in Arms
Sales Act of 2019, offers a comprehen-
sive approach, and I urge my col-
leagues to support its passage.
f
S. 1749
Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, I rise
today regarding the U.S. Senate’s pas-
sage of S. 1749, the Protecting Afford-
able Mortgages for Veterans Act, by
unanimous consent. The Protecting Af-
fordable Mortgages for Veterans Act
aims to preserve access to affordable
VA mortgages for the millions of vet-
erans and brave men and women in uni-
form in Arizona and around the coun-
try.
Last year, Congress passed S. 2155,
the Economic Growth, Regulatory Re-
lief, and Consumer Protection Act, a
bipartisan regulatory relief package
for community financial institutions.
Among other issues, this package
sought to crack down on ‘‘mortgage
churning,’’ a predatory practice where-
in lenders push veterans over and over
to repeatedly refinance their home,
even when there is no clear benefit to
doing so. With each refinance, the lend-
ers take a fee. Veterans, on the other
hand, enter into a cycle of debt where
fees and interest rates cost more than
the initial mortgage payments.
To stop these predatory lenders and
the practice of churning, S. 2155 put
into place new requirements that must
be met in order for a refinanced loan to
obtain VA guaranty and securitization
from Ginnie Mae, the U.S. Government
corporation that helps lenders make
more affordable mortgages to veterans,
first-time home buyers, and low-in-
come borrowers.
Unfortunately, these new require-
ments were inconsistent with Ginnie
Mae loan seasoning requirements. With
implementation of reform, the new
rules left approximately 2,500 VA-guar-
anteed loans ineligible for Ginnie Mae
pooling, a move which seriously con-
strained lending.
The unintended consequence of this
measure put VA home loans out of
reach and threatened to drive up future
borrowing costs. The Protecting Af-
fordable Mortgages for Veterans Act
would correct this issue and maintain
liquidity in the veteran home loan
market so that veterans and their fam-
ilies can secure the safe, affordable
housing they deserve.
When they return home, veterans
who defend our freedom with dignity
and honor should receive the thanks of
a grateful nation and opportunities to
succeed as they transition to civilian
life. That means delivering quality
care at the VA, improving job and edu-
cation opportunities, and ensuring af-
fordable housing is within reach for
Americans who made the ultimate sac-
rifice for our country. Acclimating to
civilian life is challenging enough
without the threat of being scammed
by predatory lenders.
I want to thank my colleague from
North Carolina, Senator TILLIS, for
working with me over the last several
weeks to craft this bill. I also want to
thank Chairman CRAPO, Ranking Mem-
ber BROWN, Chairman ISAKSON, and
Ranking Member TESTER for their
steadfast support in moving this fix ex-
peditiously. Even in an era of divided
government and historic gridlock, we
are getting things done for Arizona.
Now that this legislation has passed
the U.S. Senate, I urge my colleagues
in the House to quickly pass S. 1749 so
it can be signed into law. Let’s keep
working together, Democrats and Re-
publicans, to stand up for our veterans.
Thank you.

REMEMBERING PRIVATE WILLIAM
TULLY BROWN
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, Today I
wish to honor Private William Tully
Brown, a Navajo code talker who never
considered himself an American hero
but who was.
Private Brown enlisted in the Ma-
rines in 1944 and was trained as a code
talker at Camp Pendleton. Training
was intense. The code talkers under-
went extensive training in communica-
tions and in memorizing the complex
code that included Navajo words used
for 450 military terms that didn’t exist
in the Navajo or Dine language.
Private Brown was part of the Sec-
ond Marine Division. In July 1945, he
shipped out of San Diego to Pearl Har-
bor, then to Saipan in the Mariana Is-
lands, and finally to Nagasaki and
Sasebo on the island of Kyushu, Ja-
pan’s most southern main island. They
landed in Nagasaki’s harbor on Sep-
tember

23 with the mission of occupying the is-
land. They were armed in full combat
kit with fixed bayonets and full maga-
zines. They didn’t know what to expect
from the defeated Japanese. Nagasaki
had been bombed on August 9 and was
devastated. Private Brown’s division,
along with other troops, successfully
and peacefully secured the area in
short order.
Our Nation owes a great debt to the
Navajo code talkers. They transmitted
thousands and thousands of strategic
military messages during World War II,
but their code was never broken. Their
skill, bravery, and commitment to
country were integral to winning the
war.
Private Brown, like so many of our
code talkers, was humble and modest
about the courage he showed during
the war. While Private Brown did not
consider himself a hero, I do, and so
does our country, which is why he and
his fellow code talkers were awarded
the Congressional Silver Medal in 2001
for defending the freedoms and lib-
erties we enjoy today.
Private Brown lived a long and pro-
ductive life. After the war, he married
Sarah Francis and fathered five chil-
dren. He has 3 surviving children—Ro-
mero Brown, Vee Browne-Yellowhair,
and Julie Brown—and 44 grandchildren
an 2 great-great-grandchildren.
Private Brown served his country,
his community, and his family. We can
ask no more of anyone. He is part of an
American legacy.

REMEMBERING JOHN PINTO
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, today I
wish to pay tribute to New Mexico Sen-
ator John Pinto—the longest serving
member in the New Mexico Senate,
who passed away May 24 of this year at
the age of 94.
John Pinto was born December 15,
1924, in Lupton, AZ, near the New Mex-
ico border, on the Navajo Nation res-
ervation to a family of sheepherders.
He was Black Sheep born for the Red
Running into the Water Clan. He was
the oldest of seven children and had a
tough upbringing. He was raised by rel-
atives in Lupton until he was 12 years
old, when his parents took him to their
home in Gallup, NM. They lived in a
small wooden shack. They sometimes
went hungry. To eat, at times John
hunted rabbits with a sharp stick.
At that time, the Bureau of Indian
Affairs picked him up and sent him to
boarding school at Fort Defiance, AZ.
Fort Defiance was the first boarding
school on the Navajo reservation. John
entered school at age 12. He spoke no
English. They placed him in the begin-
ner class, made up of 5-, 6- and 7-year-
olds. A person of small stature, he
would joke that was the last time he
was the biggest one in the room.
John joined the Marines in 1941 and
was trained as a Navajo code talker. It
was intense training. Approximately
400 Navajos trained as code talkers dur-
ing the war. Famously, their code,
based on the unwritten Navajo or Diné
language, was never broken by the Jap-
anese. John was ready for deployment
when the war ended. He received the
Congressional Silver Medal in 2001 for
his service as a code talker. He was one
of the last remaining surviving code
talkers.
After discharge from the service, he
met the love of his life, Joann
Dennison Pinto, to whom he was mar-
ried for 65 years until her death in 2017.
Together they had two daughters,
Flora and Karen, and two sons, Cecil
and Galen.
After the war, he held odd jobs and
then, on the advice of a BIA worker, he
moved to Albuquerque to attend the
University of New Mexico. He failed
the English exam twice and was in
tears that he wouldn’t graduate and
would be sent home. He hired a tutor,
studied for 10 weeks, and passed. He
was 39 when he received his college de-
gree. He went on to earn a master’s de-
gree in elementary education and spent
his career in the Gallup-McKinley
County school system.
Senator Pinto was first elected to the
Senate in 1976, representing District 3,
comprised of parts of San Juan and
McKinley Counties in northwest New
Mexico. The Navajo Nation makes up
much of the district.
In order to get to the State legisla-
ture, in January 1997, he took a bus
from Gallup to Albuquerque and then
began hitchhiking to the State capitol
in Santa Fe. As he waited on a snowy
street corner, up pulled another State
senator, Manny Aragon, in his old Cad-
illac. Senator Aragon assumed the
hitchhiker was a transient and picked
him up. Senator Aragon asked his pas-
senger why he was going to Santa Fe,
and the hitchhiker replied, ‘‘I’m a state
senator.’’ And off they went to the be-
ginning of the legislative session to-
gether.
During his 42 years in office, Senator
Pinto worked tirelessly for the people
of New Mexico and his district. He
went into politics because he saw the
overwhelming needs of his people and
wanted to make a difference. He was
instrumental in establishing the New
Mexico Department of Indian Affairs
and setting up a Tribal infrastructure
fund for much needed projects for
Tribes. Over the years, he pushed for
dozens of projects for roads, power
lines, water systems, and public build-
ings. He was responsible for widening
U.S. Highway 491 from two to four
lanes to increase public safety and
commerce. During his last session in
the senate, this year, he was successful
in securing a $1 million appropriation
to begin a Navajo code talkers’ mu-
seum. He had fought for this project for
years to honor this group of brave and
skillful men who were so instrumental
to U.S. success in World War II.
Senator Pinto was a beloved and re-
spected figure in the State senate. He
loved to sing, and every year he sang
the ‘‘Potato Song’’ to the chamber in
his Native language—a song about
planting, growing, and harvest pota-
toes on the reservation.
He is not only the longest serving
Native American in the New Mexico
Senate, he is one of the longest serving
Native legislators in the county.
On May 17 of this year, Senator Pinto
was awarded the first honorary doc-
torate of public service to be issued by
Navajo Technical University in
Crownpoint, NM. He was immensely
proud of that honor.
I have traveled all over the Navajo
Nation with Senator Pinto. He would
call me often to talk about ways to
help. He cared deeply for his people
and, in return, was loved by them.
Senator Pinto said, ‘‘My philosophy
is to be happy, to meet people, to love
people, all the races . . . they all need
good water to drink, good food to eat,
a good warm place to stay, and they
need good jobs—that’s the basic
needs.’’ Senator Pinto understood what
it is like not to have the basics in life,
and he worked decades to make sure
his people and all New Mexicans had
those basics.
Senator John Pinto: educator, states-
man, Navajo code talker, brave Diné
warrior, loving husband and father. He
is a New Mexico legend and an Amer-
ican hero. I am proud to have known
him and to have called him my friend.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO JO MCDOUGALL
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today
I wish to recognize and congratulate Jo
McDougall for receiving the Porter
Fund’s Lifetime Achievement Award.
The Porter Fund’s Lifetime Achieve-
ment Award is presented every 5 years
to an Arkansas writer with a substan-
tial and recognized body of work. Jo is
just the fourth person to receive this
honor.
Raised on her family’s rice farm near
DeWitt, Jo discovered her love for writ-
ing and language at a young age when
her mother would read to her each
night. She wrote her first poem at just
12 years old, and her father proudly dis-
played it on his desk. This inspired her
to continue writing. Jo received an un-
dergraduate degree in home economics
from the University of Arkansas at
Fayetteville before returning in 1980 to
pursue her master of fine arts in cre-
ative writing.
After earning her MFA, Jo taught at
Pittsburg State University in Kansas
for over a decade, codirecting the uni-
versity’s creative writing department
and guiding the writing center and dis-
tinguished visiting writers program.
She has taught in Arkansas at Hendrix
College in Conway, AR, and at the Uni-
versity of Arkansas at Little Rock.
Jo’s success stretches beyond the
classroom. In April of 2018, Governor
Asa Hutchinson appointed her Poet
Laureate of Arkansas. She has pub-
lished six poetry collections and a
memoir, ‘‘Daddy’s Money: A Memoir of

Farm and Family.’’ In 2015, the Univer-
sity of Arkansas Press published a
compilation of Jo’s poetry, ‘‘In the
Home of the Famous Dead: Collected
Poems.’’ Her work is influenced by her
Arkansas heritage and often portrays
the lives of rural families and the
struggles, hardships, and everyday
challenges they face.
Jo McDougall has earned nationwide
recognition throughout her career. She
has been awarded a fellowship from the
Arkansas Arts Council and was in-
ducted into the Arkansas Writers Hall
of Fame in 2006. She has won numerous
awards, including the DeWitt Wallace/
Reader’s Digest Foundation Award, the
Porter Prize, and the Academy of
American Poets Prize.
I congratulate Jo for receiving the
Porter Fund’s Lifetime Achievement
Award. Her enduring voice, observ-
ances on small-town life, and out-
standing accomplishments and con-
tributions in poetry for the last 40
years have made her more than deserv-
ing of this recognition.∑

REMEMBERING LINDA SEUBOLD
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today
I wish to honor the life of long-time
journalist and community leader,
Linda Seubold, of Fort Smith, AR who
passed away on June 5, 2019.
Linda was an award-winning jour-
nalist, magazine editor, and supporter
of Fort Smith. Through constant cov-
erage and commentary, she was a vocal
advocate for the region’s historical,
educational and cultural assets such as
music, art, and entertainment. Her
support was crucial for the advance-
ment of vital institutions and attrac-
tions including the U.S. Marshals Mu-
seum, the area’s public libraries, the
Elvis Presley Barbershop Museum,
Chaffee Crossing, and the Bass Reeves
Statue.
During her 15 years at the Southwest
Times Record, Linda was a news re-
porter and columnist, a role model, and
‘‘newsroom mom’’ to countless young
reporters. She developed an incredible
level of trust with local officials. Ev-
eryone knew she would be fair and
thorough. Everyone knew she cared
about truth and the good of the com-
munity.
Linda was also a trusted professional
among her peers. One of her most dif-
ficult assignments was covering an exe-
cution by lethal injection. She was one
of two reporters elected to be eye-
witnesses as ‘‘pool’’ reporters, who
then had to give their notes to the rest
of the media. It was her assignment,
and she did it with professional excel-
lence, according to colleagues present
that day who had to rely on her notes.
Her popular column was a must-read
and provided an outlet for her to share
her love of the community and high-
light the local music and entertain-
ment scene. This passion eventually
led to her partnership with Lynn
Wasson to create ‘‘Entertainment Fort
Smith.’’ When the popular magazine
first launched, Linda would say that
they started the publication because
she got tired of hearing people say
there was nothing to do. As co-owner
and editor, she set out to prove people
wrong by publishing a monthly maga-
zine filled with every imaginable event.
Entertainment Fort Smith grew quick-
ly to become a local staple for informa-
tion on the culture, people, and attrac-
tions in the region. It also provided an
outlet for her and Lynn to share their
passion for education that was evident
in the magazine’s commitment to Fort
Smith Partners in Education and all
local public schools.
The last 7 years tested Linda in new
ways as she fought against cancer. Her
legendary smile, deep faith, and the
love of those around her carried her
through and she volunteered for nu-
merous medical trials that she hoped
would benefit future patients.
Linda was born in Fort Smith on Oc-
tober 24, 1942, graduated from Fort
Smith High School in 1960, and at-
tended Fort Smith Junior College. She
was preceded in death by her husband
of 55 years, Frank. They were proud
parents of five children, with 12 grand-
children and three great-children.
She will be missed as a cherished
mother, grandmother, friend, commu-
nity advocate, and professional who
truly made a difference for generations
to come.∑

RECOGNIZING MCGREGOR
INDUSTRIES
∑ Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, it gives
me great pleasure to celebrate 100
years and four generations of McGregor
Industries, an outstanding metal fab-
rication firm based in Dunmore, PA.
Since its establishment 1919,
McGregor Industries has been re-
nowned for its production of quality
railings, staircases, and iron and steel
works. The company’s roots in Scran-
ton’s South Side neighborhood firmly
placed McGregor Industries at the cen-
ter of the highly competitive iron and
steel trade market of the Northeast.
Their many high-profile projects have
built our businesses, our churches, our
schools, and even our airports in north-
eastern Pennsylvania and across the
Commonwealth.
When the company faced hardship in
a changing market of the early 2000s
and again in the 2008 financial crisis,
Robert R. ‘‘Bob’’ McGregor readily
took on the challenge to save his
grandfather’s enterprise. Bob’s engi-
neering background encouraged
McGregor Industries to evolve and
thrive in changing times through inno-
vations in engineering and develop-
ment, eventually resulting in the
McGregor Stair Tower and Stair Sys-
tems. McGregor Stair Systems soon be-
came prominent features of many
Philadelphia area building projects.
Under the leadership of a fourth gen-
eration McGregor and Wharton grad-
uate, Grace McGregor Kramer, the
company’s high-rise stair towers have
expanded to the Boston area. Contracts
with MIT and the Encore Boston Har-
bor casino are among the largest con-
struction projects in Massachusetts
history, with McGregor Industries se-
curing contracts for over 4,000 workers.
This family-led operation upholds its
reputation as a reliable and innovative
leader in its industry that architects,
engineers, contractors, and construc-
tion managers can depend upon.
McGregor Industries and its devoted
employees possess the focus and inno-
vation required of steel industries in
the 21st century, while maintaining the
spirit of a family business committed
to its community. McGregor should
take great pride in its decades of
growth and tradition of excellence
passed from generation to generation.
McGregor Industries remains a testa-
ment to American-made ingenuity.
Their commitment to service and the
betterment of communities across the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and
beyond is inspirational. I wish their
leadership and employees success for
many years to come.∑

TRIBUTE TO BOB COFFIN
∑ Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President,
today I would like to congratulate Bob
Coffin on his distinguished career and
commend his 37 years of dedicated
service to Nevada.
Bob Coffin was first elected to the
Nevada Assembly in 1982, where he
served for two terms. He was then
elected to the Nevada State Senate,
where he served until 2010. After leav-
ing the State Senate, Coffin continued
his career as a public servant, and
since 2011, he has worked to represent
the city of Las Vegas Ward 3 as coun-
cilman, a position he will retire from
this June.
Councilman Coffin has deep roots in
downtown Las Vegas, having been a
resident in and around Ward 3 for more
than 60 years. He has raised his family
less than a mile from his childhood
home.
Growing up in Las Vegas, Council-
man Coffin developed a passion for two
things—his Mexican-American heritage
and the sport of golf. His family emi-
grated to Southern California from
Mexico, and he saw firsthand the dis-
crimination his mother faced as a
young woman. The councilman has
spent much of his career fighting this
type of injustice. He has traveled to
Central America to help children and
families and has been an active mem-
ber in the Latin Chamber of Commerce.
As a young man, Councilman Coffin
attended Bishop Gorman High School
and the University of Nevada Las
Vegas, where he earned an accounting
degree. While concentrating on his
studies, he also continued to focus on
his favorite pastime, golf, and was
named the Nevada Amateur Golf
Champion at the age of 27. He went on
to serve his country in the U.S. Army
and today owns a successful insurance
business.

June 13, 2019
Councilman Coffin has been repeat-
edly recognized for his community
service, receiving dozens of awards dur-
ing his career. Most recently, he was
named Person of the Year by the
Southern Nevada Chapter of the Pro-
fessional Golfers Association and re-
ceived the Charles Dick Medal of Honor
Award from the U.S. National Guard.
He has twice been honored by the Latin
Chamber of Commerce, receiving the
Hispanic Citizen Award and the Public
Service Award.
As a councilman for the city of Las
Vegas Ward 3, Bob Coffin prioritized
keeping our communities safe revital-
izing older neighborhoods by building
new parks and fostering economic op-
portunity and development in our
great city.
Today, Bob Coffin continues his com-
mitment to the public by serving on a
number of boards and commissions, in-
cluding the Board of the Las Vegas
Golf Hall of Fame, Chief Local Elected
Officials Consortium, Commission for
the Las Vegas Centennial, Debt Man-
agement Commission, Southern Ne-
vada Regional Planning Coalition, and
the Southern Nevada Water Authority.
Bob Coffin has left his mark on Ne-
vada and his community and has im-

public service and community engage-
ment. I am grateful for all of the work
he has done for our State and con-
gratulate him on a well-deserved re-

TRIBUTE TO MIKE FABER
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this
week I have the honor of recognizing
Mike Faber for his significant impact
on the community as an educator,
coach, and mentor.
Mike Faber has selflessly served his
community by educating young Mon-
tanans in Cut Bank for 21 years and 6
years in Eureka. Mike taught a wide
range of disciplines, from physical edu-
cation to Native American history, at
both the middle school and high school
level.
Truly demonstrating a passion for
service, Mike was an instructor not
only in the classroom but also on the
field. While in Eureka, he coached
wrestling, football and track and field
for 15 years, helping young Montanans
build character and a strong work
ethic that will serve them well in their
adult years.
For almost three decades, Mike has
lived a life of servant-leadership, his
leadership in the classroom and on the
field will be greatly missed by his com-
munity. His efforts to help transform
young students into good citizens has
impacted the lives of nearly 3,000
young Montanans throughout his 27-
year career. I applaud Mike for leading
a life of excellence in educating our na-
tion’s youth and setting a standard for
exemplary service.∑
TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL
LOUIS W. WILHAM
∑ Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I
wish to recognize and congratulate BG
Louis W. Wilham, assistant adjutant
general of the Oklahoma Army Na-
tional Guard, for his extraordinary
dedication to duty and service to our
Nation. Brigadier General Wilham will
soon retire from the Oklahoma Na-
tional Guard after 31 years of service.
Brigadier General Wilham enlisted in
the Oklahoma Army National Guard in
1987 and received his commission
through the Oklahoma Military De-
partment’s officer candidate school in
1989. Since then, General Wilham has
served in a variety of key leadership
and staff positions within the Okla-
homa National Guard, commanding at
the company, battalion, and brigade
levels prior to serving as the assistant
adjutant general and interim adjutant
general. Throughout the course of his
career, Brigadier General Wilham has
supported numerous mobilizations for
both State and Federal missions. In
2008, he deployed to Iraq in support of
Operation Iraqi Freedom, serving with
the Joint Area Support Group-Central
in Baghdad. In 2017, while serving as
the interim adjutant general of the
Oklahoma National Guard, Brigadier
General Wilham oversaw the mobiliza-
tion of over 2,000 Oklahoma soldiers
and airmen in support of Hurricane
Harvey.
During the course of Brigadier Gen-
eral Wilham’s service to our Nation, he
earned awards and decorations, includ-
ing: the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star
Medal, Meritorious Service Medal with
two bronze oakleaf clusters, Joint
Service Commendation Medal, Army
Commendation Medal with one bronze
oakleaf, Army Achievement Medal
with three bronze oakleaf clusters, Iraq
Campaign Medial with one Bronze
Campaign Star, and Combat Action
Badge.
On behalf of my colleagues and the
entire U.S. Senate, I want to person-
ally thank Brigadier General Wilham
and his family for over three decades of
selfless service to the State of Okla-
homa and the United States of Amer-
ica. He will leave a legacy of leadership
and integrity that will remain with the
Oklahoma National Guard for many
years to come. I wish Brigadier General
Wilham, his wife Jodi and their daugh-
ters, Taylor and Shelby, the very best
as he retires from military service.∑

TRIBUTE TO JACK MIDDLETON
∑ Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today
I wish to salute Jack Middleton for his
60-plus years of dedicated service to the
Mount Washington Observatory. Jack
is stepping down this year from his
longtime post as secretary of the board
of trustees. In this role, he helped to
build the observatory into a respected
authority on climate research, and he
leaves a legacy worthy of our praise
and our gratitude.
Those of us who know Jack recognize
him as president of McLane Middleton,
one of the largest law practices in the
Granite State and a firm that encour-
ages its attorneys to be active partici-
pants in their communities. This is un-
doubtedly a reflection of one of Jack’s
core beliefs. He has been a force in rais-
ing awareness and funds for programs
like DOVE—the Domestic Violence
Emergency Project—that provide legal
representation free of charge for people
in need. Jack has also served as presi-
dent of the United Way and board
member of the New Hampshire Chari-
table Foundation, New Hampshire Pub-
lic Television, The White Mountain
School, and The Nature Conservancy,
always finding a way to employ his di-
verse talents in pursuit of a greater
good.
Those of us who really know Jack
understand that he is just as com-
fortable on top of a mountain as he is
in a courtroom or boardroom. It was a
young Sergeant Middleton—fresh out
of his service in the Marine Corps—who
arrived at the Appalachian Mountain
Club’s Pinkham Notch Camp in 1952 for
a new job at a warming hut on Mount
Washington’s Tuckerman Ravine. He
was drawn there after hiking in the
White Mountains as a child and staying
with friends in the Madison and Lake
of the Clouds Huts as a teenager. This
new venture was the beginning of a
decades-long, unbroken connection to
New Hampshire’s highest peak.
While working as an observer at the
Mount Washington Observatory in the
early 1950s, Jack discovered another
love—Ann Dodge, the daughter of Ob-
servatory founder Joe Dodge and
Jack’s future wife. Dating the boss’s
daughter has it challenges, but anyone
could see that the bond between Jack
and Annie was immediate and strong.
On his days off, Jack would hike down
the mountain to see her at the AMC
Pinkham Notch Hut. Annie would re-
turn the favor when she was free, scal-
ing the 6,288-foot mountain to visit
Jack when his duties kept him inside
the Observatory.
Jack left his job to attend law school
after 1 year at the Observatory. Short-
ly after graduating, he was tapped to
serve as corporate secretary by a board
of trustees who both recognized his po-
tential and appreciated his love of the
mountain and its summit. That was
1957. Jack has been diligently taking
minutes at board meetings ever since,
and he remains an outstanding ambas-
sador of the Observatory and an out-
spoken supporter of its important role
in climate research.
Over the past few decades, the Mount
Washington Observatory has emerged
as a significant institution of science
education and plays a vital role in
helping advance the public under-
standing of the complexities of our nat-
ural world. Its Weather Discovery Cen-
ter in North Conway has become a pop-
ular resource in communicating these
findings to classrooms and workshops
across the globe. Throughout each step

TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM SAUBLE
∑ Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I rise
today to honor William Sauble of Max-
well, NM, for decades of outstanding
service to his community.
Bill was born into a ranching family
in Maxwell, in North Central New Mex-
ico, and has lived in that community
almost all his life. After graduating
with honors with a bachelor’s degree in
animal science from New Mexico State
University in 1970, he married his high
school sweetheart, Debbie. He then en-
tered the Navy, where he served 2 years
of Active Duty and 5 years in the Re-
serve. After returning home from the
Navy, Bill and Debbie took up the fam-
ily ranching business. They are the
proud parents of two children, Troy
Sauble and Tara Sauble Foster, and
grandparents of two grandchildren.
Bill has been a leader in the commu-
nity and in ranching in New Mexico all
his life. The number of civic organiza-
tions that Bill has been a part of is too
numerous to list. He has served as
president of the New Mexico Cattle
Growers Association, the Colfax Coun-
ty Farm Bureau, and the Colfax Coun-
ty Fair Association, and as chair of the
New Mexico Livestock Board, the Agri-
cultural Advisory Committee to the
New Mexico State Land Office, the city
of Raton Extra-Territorial Zoning
Commission, and the American Farm
Bureau Public Lands Committee.
As a tribute to their ranching skills
and acumen, in 2012, he and Debbie
were awarded the New Mexico Farm
and Livestock Farm Family of the
Year. That same year, Bill was named
Cattleman of the Year by the New Mex-
ico Cattle Growers Association. Bill
has not only worked hard for his own
family ranch, but he has worked tire-
lessly to improve the cattle business
throughout New Mexico, spending
countless hours traveling the State on
behalf of cattle growers and the live-
stock board.
Bill has the respect of his community
and served on the Colfax County Com-
mission between 2009 and 2018. As chair
of the commission, he doggedly pur-
sued Transportation Investment, Gen-
erating economic recovery, or TIGER,
grants to obtain capital investment for
transportation projects for his county.
When Amtrak threatened to dis-
continue Southwest Chief service be-
tween Dodge, KS, and Albuquerque,
NM, Bill worked with me, the rest of
the New Mexico congressional delega-
tion, and the Kansas and Colorado dele-
gations to secure funding from Con-
gress and commitments from Amtrak
to continue this critically important
service.
Bill is a person of integrity and char-
acter. He has a heart of gold. All his
life he gave back to his community and
our State. New Mexico owes him a debt
of gratitude. I wish him and his family
my very best.∑

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE
REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION
OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY
THAT WAS ORIGINALLY DE-
CLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER
13405 OF JUNE 16, 2006, WITH RE-
SPECT TO BELARUS—PM 19
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message
from the President of the United
States, together with an accompanying
report, which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Banking, Housing, and
Urban Affairs.
To the Congress of the United States:
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90
days before the anniversary date of its
declaration, the President publishes in
the Federal Register and transmits to
the Congress a notice stating that the
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to
the Federal Register for publication the
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to the
actions and policies of certain mem-
bers of the Government of Belarus and
other persons to undermine democratic
processes or institutions of Belarus
that was declared in Executive Order
13405 of June 16, 2006, is to continue in
effect beyond June 16, 2019.
The actions and policies of certain
members of the Government of Belarus
and other persons to undermine
Belarus’s democratic processes or insti-
tutions, to commit human rights
abuses related to political repression,
and to engage in public corruption con-
tinue to pose an unusual and extraor-
dinary threat to the national security
and foreign policy of the United States.
Therefore, I have determined that it is
necessary to continue the national
emergency declared in Executive Order
13405 with respect to Belarus.
DONALD J. TRUMP.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr.
LANKFORD, Mr. TESTER, and Mr.
SCOTT, of South Carolina):
S. 1851. A bill to amend the Higher
Education Act of 1965 to provide Fed-
eral Pell Grants to Iraq and Afghani-
stan veteran’s dependents; to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor,
and Pensions.
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President. When a
U.S. servicemember gives their life in
service to their Nation, they often
leave behind family who we are equally
indebted to. Ensuring that these sur-
vivors are provided every opportunity
to succeed and get a quality education
supports our values and upholds our
promise to servicemembers and mili-
tary families. Unfortunately, our abil-
ity to uphold our promise to depend-
ents of servicemembers who were
killed in action (KIA) in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan following the attacks on
September 11, 2001 has been affected.
As a result of sequestration, the U.S.
Department of Education (ED) sent a
letter to institutions requiring them to
reduce the Iraq and Afghanistan Serv-
ice Grant awards by about 6.2% or al-
most $400 per recipient for the 2018–2019
award year. These grants are critical
for students to use for tuition, books,
and room and board and any future cut
would be significant for a young col-
lege student. Many children and de-
pendents of servicemembers who were
KIA in Iraq and Afghanistan are now
reaching college age so more and more
students will not be receiving as much
in grants as they should be getting and
rightfully deserve.
Today, I am pleased to introduce
with my colleagues Senator LANKFORD,
Senator TESTER, and Senator SCOTT
(from South Carolina) a bipartisan bill
called the Protecting our Gold Star
Families’ Act of 2019. This legislation
will move the Iraq and Afghanistan
Service Grant program to the Pell
Grant program to stabilize the funding
source for these awards and ensure
Gold Star families have access to the
maximum Pell Grant funding available
if they previously did not qualify for
Pell Grants. Additionally the bill
would align eligibility requirements
under existing Department of Veterans
Affairs grants such as the Fry Scholar-
ship with ED and the Iraq and Afghani-
stan Service program to ensure that all
Gold Star families are receiving the
award.
While Virginia public universities al-
ready offer tuition assistance to de-
pendents whose parents were killed in
action or were permanently disabled
under the state’s Virginia Military
Survivors and Dependents Education
Program (VMSDEP), these funds could
be used to offset tuition at private in-
stitutions and could also cover addi-
tional expenses, including room and
board, books, and supplies. Over 500
Virginians have attended or are cur-
rently attending college at public uni-
versities with assistance through
VMSDEP and would qualify for these
Pell Grants as well.
Our Gold Star families have made the
ultimate sacrifice for this country.
Helping them afford college is the least
we can do. We should give our
servicemembers a peace of mind that if
anything happens to them, the nation
they served will look out for their chil-
dren and help them access a high-qual-
ity education. As more of our post 9/11
Gold Star children are starting to
reach college age, now is the right time
to improve the program. I hope that
my colleagues will incorporate this bi-
partisan bill in a reauthorization of the
Higher Education Act.
By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and
Ms. DUCKWORTH):
S. 1852. A bill to require rulemaking
by the Administrator of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency to ad-
dress considerations in evaluating the
need for public and individual disaster
assistance, and for other purposes; to
the Committee on Homeland Security
and Governmental Affairs.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the text of the
bill be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the text of
the bill was ordered to be printed in

ert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emer-
gency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.)
and was denied on or after January 1, 2012.
By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr.
GRASSLEY, and Mr. LEAHY):
S. 1854. A bill to enhance civil pen-
alties under the Federal securities
laws, and for other purposes; to the
Committee on Banking, Housing, and
Urban Affairs.
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am
reintroducing the Stronger Enforce-
ment of Civil Penalties Act along with
Senator GRASSLEY and Senator LEAHY.
This bill will help securities regulators
better protect investors and demand
greater accountability from market
players. Even after a financial crisis
that devastated our nation’s economy,
we continue to see calculated wrong-
doing by some on Wall Street, and
without the consequence of meaningful
penalties to serve as an effective deter-
rent, I worry this disturbing culture of
misconduct will persist.
Today, the amount of penalties the
Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) can fine an institution or indi-
vidual is restricted by statute. During
hearings I held in 2011 as Chairman of
the Banking Committee’s Securities,
Insurance, and Investment Sub-
committee, I learned how this limita-
tion significantly interferes with the
SEC’s ability to perform its enforce-
ment duties. At that time, a Federal
judge had criticized the SEC for not ob-
taining a larger settlement against
Citigroup, a major player in the finan-
cial crisis that settled with the agency
in an amount that was far below the
cost the bank had inflicted on inves-
tors. The SEC explained that a statu-
tory prohibition against levying a larg-
er penalty led to the low settlement
amount. Indeed, then SEC Chairman

Mary L. Schapiro in 2011 also explained
that ‘‘the Commission’s statutory au-
thority to obtain civil monetary pen-
alties with appropriate deterrent effect
is limited in many circumstances.’’
The bipartisan bill we are reintro-
ducing seeks to update the SEC’s out-
dated civil penalties statutes. This bill
strives to make potential and current
offenders think twice before engaging
in misconduct by increasing the max-
imum statutory civil monetary pen-
alties, directly linking the size of the
penalties to the amount of losses suf-
fered by victims of a violation, and
substantially raising the financial
stakes for repeat offenders of our na-
tion’s securities laws.
Specifically, our bill would expand
the SEC’s options to tailor penalties to
the specific circumstances of a given
violation. In addition to raising the per
violation caps for severe, or ‘‘third
tier,’’ violations to $1 million per of-
fense for individuals and $10 million
per offense for entities, the legislation
would also give the SEC additional op-
tions to obtain greater penalties based
on the ill-gotten gains of the violator
or on the financial harm to investors.
Our bill also strives to deter repeat
offenders on Wall Street through two
provisions. The first would allow the
SEC to triple the penalty cap applica-
ble to recidivists who have been held
either criminally or civilly liable for
securities fraud within the previous
five years. The second would allow the
SEC to seek a civil penalty against
those who violate existing federal
court or SEC orders, an approach that
would be more efficient, effective, and
flexible than the current civil con-
tempt remedy. These changes would
greatly improve the SEC’s ability to
levy robust penalties against repeat of-
fenders.
Slightly more than half of all U.S.
households are invested in the stock
market. All of our constituents deserve
a strong cop on the beat that has the
necessary tools to go after fraudsters
and pursue the difficult cases arising
from our increasingly complex finan-
cial markets. The Stronger Enforce-
ment of Civil Penalties Act will en-
hance the SEC’s ability to demand
meaningful accountability from Wall
Street, which in turn will increase
transparency and confidence in our fi-
nancial system. I urge our colleagues
to support this important bipartisan
legislation.
By Mr. DURBIN:
S. 1863. A bill to require the Sec-
retary of the Interior to conduct a spe-
cial resource study of the sites associ-
ated with the life and legacy of the
noted American philanthropist and
business executive Julius Rosenwald,
with a special focus on the Rosenwald
Schools, and for other purposes; to the
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the text of the
bill be printed in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the text of
the bill was ordered to be printed in
the RECORD, as follows:
S. 1863
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Julius
Rosenwald and Rosenwald Schools Study Act
of 2019’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(1) Julius Rosenwald was born in 1862 in
Springfield, Illinois, to Samuel Rosenwald
and his wife, Augusta Hammerslough, a Jew-
ish immigrant couple from Germany;
(2) in 1868, Samuel Rosenwald purchased
the Lyon House, where Julius grew up and
lived with his family until the 1880s, which—
(A) was diagonally across the street from
the home where Abraham Lincoln lived prior
to becoming president; and
(B)(i) was restored recently before the date
of enactment of this Act; and
(ii) as of that date of enactment, was with-
in the boundary of the Lincoln Home Na-
tional Historic Site, a unit of the National
Park System;
(3) Julius Rosenwald—
(A) learned the clothing trade with rel-
atives in New York City; and
(B) used that knowledge on moving to Chi-
cago, where he became part-owner and presi-
dent of Sears, Roebuck & Company, which—
(i) he transformed into a retailing power-
house in the early 20th century; and
(ii) could be considered the Amazon of its
day;
(4) the embodiment of the Jewish concept
of ‘‘tzedakah’’, righteousness and charity,
Rosenwald used his fortune for numerous
philanthropic activities, particularly to en-
hance the lives of African-Americans, includ-
ing by—
(A) providing $25,000 for the construction of
Young Men’s Christian Associations (com-
monly known as ‘‘YMCAs’’) for African-
Americans during the Jim Crow era in cities
that raised $75,000; and
(B) eventually, supporting the construc-
tion of YMCAs in 24 cities across the United
States;
(5)(A) after his introduction to Booker T.
Washington in 1911, Julius Rosenwald—
(i) joined the Board of Trustees of the
Tuskegee Institute; and
(ii) financially contributed to a pilot pro-
gram to build 6 schools in rural Alabama for
African-American children who were receiv-
ing little to no education; and
(B) the donations by Rosenwald described
in subparagraph (A) were matched by the
local African-American communities that
were committed to providing education for
their children;
(6)(A) the success of the pilot program re-
ferred to in paragraph (5)(A)(ii) led to the
construction of more than 5,300 Rosenwald
Schools and related buildings over a 20-year
period in 15 southern States under the direc-
tion of the Julius Rosenwald Fund;
(B) the schools described in subparagraph
(A)—
(i) were the result of a 3-way partnership
among the Julius Rosenwald Fund, local
communities that, although generally poor,
contributed land, labor, materials, and
money to build and maintain the schools,
and local governments that were required by
law to provide public schools for all children
but divided funds unequally between black
and white systems; and
(ii) often became the focus of great pride
and affection among the applicable commu-
nities;
(C) during the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, 1⁄3 of
all African-American children in the South
were educated in Rosenwald Schools;
(D) a 2011 study by 2 Federal Reserve
economists concluded that the schools
played a significant role in narrowing the
gap between the educational levels of black
and white students in the South; and
(E) Members of Congress and poet Maya
Angelou are among prominent graduates of
Rosenwald Schools;
(7) the Julius Rosenwald Fund—
(A) supported early National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People cases
that eventually led to the Supreme Court de-
cision in Brown v. Board of Education of To-
peka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), which outlawed seg-
regation in public education; and
(B) provided fellowships to talented Afri-
can-Americans in the arts and sciences—
(i) including the acclaimed historian John
Hope Franklin, noted writer and civil rights
activist W.E.B. Du Bois, artist Jacob Law-
rence, singer Marian Anderson, diplomat
Ralph Bunche, and many others; and
(ii) some of whom worked under Thurgood
Marshall on the Supreme Court case referred
to in subparagraph (A);
(8) Rosenwald also—
(A) provided support for a number of His-
torically Black Colleges and Universities, in-
cluding Fisk, Dillard, and Howard Univer-
sities; and
(B) used his wealth for other worthy
causes, including the creation of the Jewish
United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago and
the Museum of Science and Industry in Chi-
cago; and
(9) the contributions of Julius Rosenwald
to improving the lives of African-Americans,
as well as the lives of those who reside in
Chicago and throughout the United States,
are worthy of recognition and further exam-
ination.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS
SENATE RESOLUTION 250—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE
SENATE THAT THE DEPART-
MENT OF THE INTERIOR HAS
BROKEN A COMMITMENT TO THE
BLACKFEET TRIBE TO DEFEND
THE CANCELLATION OF ALL
LEASES IN THE BADGER-TWO
MEDICINE AREA AND URGING
THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTE-
RIOR TO WORK CLOSELY WITH
THE BLACKFEET TRIBE TO DE-
FEND THE BADGER-TWO MEDI-
CINE AREA FROM OIL AND GAS
DEVELOPMENT
Mr. TESTER submitted the following
resolution; which was referred to the
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources:
S. RES. 250
Whereas the Badger-Two Medicine area is
sacred to the Blackfeet Tribe and holds crit-
ical and unique importance in the culture
and history of the Blackfeet Tribe;
Whereas the Department of the Interior
issued leases for the development of oil and
gas resources in the Badger-Two Medicine
area without proper Tribal consultation;
Whereas the Department of the Interior
has sought to cancel all remaining leases in
the Badger-Two Medicine area, citing viola-
tions of the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and divi-
sion A of subtitle III of title 54, United
States Code (formerly known as the ‘‘Na-
tional Historic Preservation Act’’ (16 U.S.C.
470 et seq.)), before the leases were issued;
Whereas the 2 remaining leaseholders in
the Badger-Two Medicine area, Solenex LLC
and W. A. Moncrief, challenged the cancella-
tion of their leases in a district court of the
United States;
Whereas former Secretary of the Interior
Ryan Zinke committed to the Blackfeet
Tribe that the Department of the Interior
would continue to defend the lease cancella-
tions in court after the district court ruled
against the Department;
Whereas the Department of the Interior
appealed the decision in the Solenex LLC
case, but did not appeal the decision in the
W. A. Moncrief case, instead moving to dis-
miss the W. A. Moncrief case and reissuing
the W. A. Moncrief lease;
Whereas the Department of the Interior ar-
gued that the court of appeals does not have
jurisdiction to consider an appeal taken by
the intervenors in the W. A. Moncrief case,
an argument that would deny the Tribal
leaders who intervened in that case the abil-
ity to defend the Badger-Two Medicine area
on appeal;
Whereas the Federal Government has the
duty to honor the trust responsibilities of
the Federal Government to the Blackfeet
Tribe and the promises made by the Sec-
retary of the Interior to the leadership of the
Blackfeet Tribe, and the development of the
Badger-Two Medicine area would be a com-
plete abandonment of that duty; and
Whereas the Forest Service and the De-
partment of the Interior have publicly and
repeatedly acknowledged the importance of
protecting the landscape of the Badger-Two
Medicine area from further development
through—
(1) moratoriums on new leases;
(2) suspensions on drilling activity;
(3) management plans focused on pre-
serving the landscape;
(4) the voluntary retirement of leases; and
(5) the cancellation of active leases: Now,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That—
(1) it is the sense of the Senate that the
Department of the Interior—
(A) has broken the commitment made by
the Department to the Blackfeet Tribe;
(B) has failed—
(i) to honor the trust responsibilities of the
Department to the Blackfeet Tribe; and
(ii) to regain the credibility of the Depart-
ment; and
(C) must actively pursue and defend, in and
out of the courtroom, the cancellation of all
leases in the Badger-Two Medicine area; and
(2) the Senate urges the Department of the
Interior—
(A) to work closely with the Blackfeet
Tribe to protect the Badger-Two Medicine
area from oil and gas leases; and
(B) to remedy the mistakes of the Depart-
ment that led to the leases being issued
without—
(i) proper consultation with the Blackfeet
Tribe; and
(ii) compliance with environmental and
historic preservation laws.

SENATE RESOLUTION 251—RECOG-
NIZING 2019 AS THE INTER-
NATIONAL YEAR OF THE SALM-
ON, A FRAMEWORK OF COLLABO-
RATION ACROSS THE NORTHERN
HEMISPHERE TO SUSTAIN AND
RECOVER SALMON STOCKS
THROUGH RESEARCH, PARTNER-
SHIPS, AND PUBLIC ACTION
Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Ms.
COLLINS, Mr. SULLIVAN, Mr. KING, Mr.
WYDEN, Mr. MERKLEY, Mrs. MURRAY,
and Ms. CANTWELL) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred
to the Committee on Commerce,
Science, and Transportation:
S. RES. 251
Whereas salmon are a vital resource, pro-
viding communities with cultural and social
value, food security, and economic oppor-
tunity;
Whereas salmon are critically important
to marine and aquatic ecosystems and indi-
cators of the health of rivers and oceans that
people, fish, and wildlife depend on;
Whereas salmon can be vulnerable to im-
pacts from human interference, including de-
velopment pressures and climate change;
Whereas drawing on science, Indigenous
knowledge, and the experience of fishers,
policy makers, resource managers, and oth-
ers is essential to conserve salmon;
Whereas people from all walks of life can
learn about the value of salmon and support
salmon conservation; and
Whereas salmon migrations span national
boundaries, and collaborating and sharing
knowledge across borders is critical to sus-
taining salmon stocks: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate recognizes 2019
as the International Year of the Salmon, a
unique, hemispheric-level collaboration
bringing people together in order to ensure
that healthy wild salmon populations persist
into the future.

of North Dakota and the Chippewa-Cree
Tribe of the Rocky Boy’s Reservation of
Montana, which also are political successors
to the signatories of the Pembina Treaty of

continue to live in the State of Montana, as
their ancestors have for more than 100 years
since ceding land in the State of North Da-
kota as described in paragraph (1);

monly known as the ‘‘Indian Reorganization
Act’’);

during the Depression, the Bureau of Indian
Affairs lacked adequate financial resources
to purchase land for the Tribe, and the mem-
bers of the Tribe were denied the oppor-
tunity to reorganize;

Government to appropriate adequate funding

ASSURANCE INITIATIVE ACT WITH
REGARD TO TAIWAN ARMS SALES.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) The Department of Defense Indo-Pacific
Strategy Report (referred to in this section
as the ‘‘Indo-Pacific Strategy’’), released on
June 1, 2019, states: ‘‘[T]he Asia Reassurance
Initiative Act, a major bipartisan legisla-
tion, was signed into law by President
Trump on December 31, 2018. This legislation
enshrines a generational whole-of-govern-
ment policy framework that demonstrates
U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-Pa-
cific region and includes initiatives that pro-
mote sovereignty, rule of law, democracy,
economic engagement, and regional secu-
rity.’’.

est in upholding the rules-based inter-
national order, which includes a strong,
prosperous, and democratic Taiwan. . .The

services in such quantity as may be nec-
essary to enable Taiwan to maintain a suffi-
cient self-defense capability.’’.
(3) Section 209(b) of the Asia Reassurance
Initiative Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–409),

future threats from the People’s Republic of
China, including supporting the efforts of
Taiwan to develop and integrate asymmetric
capabilities, as appropriate, including mo-
bile, survivable, and cost-effective capabili-
ties, into its military forces.’’.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of
2018 (Public Law 115–409) has recommitted
the United States to support the close, eco-
nomic, political, and security relationship
between the United States and Taiwan; and
(2) the United States should fully imple-
ment the provisions of that Act with regard
to regular defensive arms sales to Taiwan.
(c) BRIEFING.—Not later than 30 days after

SEC. 12ll. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON POLICY TO-
WARD HONG KONG.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) The United States policy toward Hong
Kong is guided by the United States-Hong
Kong Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102–383;
106 Stat. 1448) (referred to in this section as
the ‘‘Act’’), which reaffirms that ‘‘The Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region of the
People’s Republic of China, beginning on
July 1, 1997, will continue to enjoy a high de-
gree of autonomy on all matters other than
defense and foreign affairs.’’.
(2) The Act furthermore states that ‘‘The
human rights of the people of Hong Kong are
of great importance to the United States and
are directly relevant to United States inter-
ests in Hong Kong.’’.
(3) Pursuant to section 301 of the Act (22
U.S.C. 5731), the annual report issued by the
Department of State on developments in
Hong Kong (referred to in this section as the
‘‘Report’’), released on March 21, 2019, states
that ‘‘Cooperation between the United
States Government and the Hong Kong gov-
ernment remains broad and effective in
many areas, providing significant benefits to
the United States economy and homeland se-
curity.’’.
(4) The Report states that ‘‘the Chinese
mainland central government implemented
or instigated a number of actions that ap-
peared inconsistent with China’s commit-
ments in the Basic Law, and in the Sino-
British Joint Declaration of 1984, to allow
Hong Kong to exercise a high degree of au-
tonomy.’’.
(5) The Report furthermore states that the
‘‘Hong Kong authorities took actions aligned
with mainland priorities at the expense of
human rights and fundamental freedoms.
There were particular setbacks in demo-
cratic electoral processes, freedom of expres-
sion, and freedom of association.’’.
(6) On June 10, 2019, the spokesporson for
the Department of State issued a statement
expressing ‘‘grave concern about the Hong
Kong government’s proposed amendments to
its Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, which, if
passed, would permit Chinese authorities to
request the extradition of individuals to
mainland China.’’.
(7) According to media reports, in June
2019, over 1,000,000 residents of Hong Kong
have taken part in demonstrations against
the proposed amendments to the Fugitive Of-
fenders Ordinance.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) the government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China and the Hong Kong Special Ad-
ministrative Region of the People’s Republic
of China authorities should immediately
cease taking all actions that undermine
Hong Kong’s autonomy and negatively im-
pact the protections of fundamental human
rights, freedoms, and democratic values of
the people of Hong Kong, as enshrined in the
Act, Hong Kong’s Basic Law of 1997, and the
Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984;
(2) the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region of the People’s Republic of China au-
thorities should immediately withdraw from
consideration the proposed amendments to
its Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and refrain
from any unwarranted use of force against
the protestors that is inconsistent with
internationally recognized law enforcement
best practices; and
(3) the United States should impose finan-
cial sanctions, visa bans, and other punitive
economic measures against all individuals or
entities violating the fundamental human
rights and freedoms of the people of Hong
Kong, consistent with United States and
international law.
SA 425. Mr. HOEVEN (for himself,

ROBUST AND MODERN ICBM FORCE
TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF THE
NUCLEAR TRIAD OF THE UNITED
STATES.
(a) FINDINGS.—The Senate makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) Land-based intercontinental ballistic
missiles (in this section referred to as
‘‘ICBMs’’) have been a critical part of the
strategic deterrent of the United States for 6
decades in conjunction with air and sea-
based strategic delivery systems.
(2) President John F. Kennedy referred to
the deployment of the first Minuteman mis-
sile during the Cuban Missile Crisis as his
‘‘ace in the hole’’.
(3) The Minuteman III missile entered
service in 1970 and is still deployed in 2019,
well beyond its originally intended service
life.
(4) The ICBM force of the United States
peaked at more than 1,200 deployed missiles
during the Cold War.
(5) The ICBM force of the United States
currently consists of approximately 400 Min-
uteman III missiles deployed across 450 oper-
ational missile silos, each carrying a single
warhead.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3496 June 13, 2019
(6) The Russian Federation currently de-
ploys at least 300 ICBMs with multiple war-
heads loaded on each missile and has an-
nounced plans to replace its Soviet-era sys-
tems with modernized ICBMs.
(7) The People’s Republic of China cur-
rently deploys at least 75 ICBMs and plans to
grow its ICBM force through the deployment
of modernized, road-mobile ICBMs that carry
multiple warheads.
(8) The Russian Federation and the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China deploy nuclear weap-
ons across a variety of platforms in addition
to their ICBM forces.
(9) Numerous countries possess or are seek-
ing to develop nuclear weapons capabilities
that pose challenges to the nuclear deter-
rence of the United States.
(10) The nuclear deterrent of the United
States is comprised of a triad of delivery sys-
tems for nuclear weapons, including sub-
marine-launched ballistic missiles (in this
subsection referred to as ‘‘SLBMs’’), air-de-
livered gravity bombs and cruise missiles,
and land-based ballistic missiles that provide
interlocking and mutually reinforcing at-
tributes that enhance strategic deterrence.
(11) Weakening one leg of the triad limits
the deterrent value of the other legs of the
triad.
(12) In the nuclear deterrent of the United
States, ICBMs provide commanders with the
most prompt response capability, SLBMs
provide stealth and survivability, and air-
craft armed with nuclear weapons provide
flexibility.
(13) The ICBM force of the United States
forces any would-be attacker to confront
more than 400 discrete targets, thus creating
an effectively insurmountable targeting
problem for a potential adversary.
(14) The size, dispersal, and global reach of
the ICBM force of the United States ensures
that no adversary can escalate a crisis be-
yond the ability of the United States to re-
spond.
(15) A potential attacker would be forced
to expend far more warheads to destroy the
ICBMs of the United States than the United
States would lose in an attack, because of
the deployment of a single warhead on each
ICBM of the United States.
(16) The ICBM force provides a persistent
deterrent capability that reinforces strategic
stability.
(17) ICBMs are the cheapest delivery sys-
tem for nuclear weapons for the United
States to operate and maintain.
(18) United States Strategic Command has
validated military requirements for the
unique capabilities of ICBMs.
(19) In a 2014 analysis of alternatives, the
Air Force concluded that replacing the Min-
uteman III missile would provide upgraded
capabilities at lower cost when compared
with extending the service life of the Min-
uteman III missile.
(20) The Minuteman III replacement pro-
gram, known as the ground-based strategic
deterrent, is expected to provide a land-
based strategic deterrent capability for 5
decades after the program enters service.
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense
of the Senate that—
(1) land-based ICBMs have certain charac-
teristics, including responsiveness, persist-
ence, and dispersal, that enhance strategic
stability and magnify the deterrent value of
the air and sea-based legs of the nuclear
triad of the United States;
(2) ICBMs have played and continue to play
a role in deterring attacks on the United
States and its allies;
(3) while arms control agreements have re-
duced the size of the ICBM force of the
United States, adversaries of the United
States continue to enhance, enlarge, and
modernize their ICBM forces;
(4) the modernization of the ICBM force of
the United States through the ground-based
strategic deterrent program should be sup-
ported;
(5) ICBMs have the lowest operation, main-
tenance, and modernization costs of any part
of the nuclear deterrent of the United
States; and
(6) unilaterally reducing the size of the
ICBM force of the United States or delaying
the implementation of the ground-based
strategic deterrent program would degrade
the deterrent capabilities of a fully oper-
ational and modernized nuclear triad and
should not take place at the present time.

SEC. 333. SENSE OF SENATE ON PRIORITIZING
SURVIVABLE LOGISTICS FOR THE
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.
It is the sense of the Senate that—
(1) resilient and agile logistics are nec-
essary to implement the 2018 National De-
fense Strategy because it enables the United
States to project power and sustain the fight
against its strategic competitors in peace-
time and during war;
(2) the joint logistics enterprise of the
Armed Forces of the United States faces
high-end threats from strategic competitors
China, Russia, and Iran, all of whom have in-
vested in anti-access area denial capabilities
and gray zone tactics;
(3) there are significant logistics short-
falls, as outlined in the November 2018 final
report of the Defense Science Board (DSB)
Task Force on Survivable Logistics, which,
if left unaddressed, would hamper the readi-
ness and ability of the Armed Forces of the
United States to conduct operations glob-
ally;
(4) since the military departments have
not shown a strong commitment to funding
logistics, the Secretary of Defense should re-
view the full list of recommendations listed
in the report described in paragraph (3) and
address the chronic underfunding of logistics
relative to other priorities of the Depart-
ment of Defense.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3509
June 13, 2019
(1) The Castro regime has used arbitrary
incarcerations, harassment, and intimida-
tion to deny basic freedoms to thousands of
Cubans since the Cuban Revolution.
(2) In April 2019, a family was sent to pris-
on by authorities in Cuba for homeschooling
their children.
(3) The children were enrolled in a Chris-
tian distance school in Honduras.
(4) The families involved, which included a
pastor, cited religious reasons for
homeschooling their children.
(5) The Government of Cuba has a history
of arresting individuals who chose to
homeschool their children and sentencing
them to prison time and hard labor.
(6) The Government of Cuba’s insistence on
state-controlled education is a sign of
authoritarianism, enabling them to indoctri-
nate youth with a communist ideology.
(7) Parents have the right to teach their
children free from the state indoctrination
of an autocratic regime.
(8) The United States Commission on
International Religious Freedom formerly
condemned Cuba for actions pertaining to
the April 2019 imprisonment of those who
homeschool their children.
(9) The United States has instituted an em-
bargo on Cuba in 1960.
(10) The Cuban Liberty and Democratic
Solidarity (Libertad) Act of 1996 (22 U.S.C.
6021 et seq.) does not permit these sanctions
to be lifted until the Castro regime has been
deposed and Cuba has legalized political ac-
tivity and made a commitment to free and
fair elections.
(11) Despite the 2014 Executive branch deci-
sion to normalize relations with Cuba, it is
still in the power of Congress to lift an em-
bargo.
(b) SENSE OF SENATE.—The Senate—

Cuba in their pursuit of religious freedom;

lease all political prisoners, including those
who have been imprisoned for homeschooling
their children;

mission on Human Rights to grant the Pre-
cautionary Measures requested on April 25,
2019;
(4) calls on the Government of Cuba to rec-
ognize the right of parents to teach their
own children free from state communist in-
doctrination;
(5) calls on the Government of Cuba to in-
stitute democratic reforms, including re-
forms that guarantee freedom of religion;
and
(6) calls for the continued implementation
of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Soli-
darity Act of 1996.

TITLE XVII—OTTO WARMBIER BANKING
RESTRICTIONS INVOLVING NORTH
KOREA ACT OF 2019
SEC. 1701. SHORT TITLE.
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Otto
Warmbier Banking Restrictions Involving
North Korea Act of 2019’’.
Subtitle A—Sanctions With Respect to North
Korea
SEC. 1711. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) Since 2006, the United Nations Security
Council has adopted 10 resolutions imposing
sanctions against North Korea under chapter
VII of the United Nations Charter, which—
(A) prohibit the use, development, and pro-
liferation of weapons of mass destruction by
North Korea;
(B) prohibit the supply, sale, or transfer of
arms and related materiel to or from North
Korea;
(C) prohibit the transfer of luxury goods to
North Korea;
(D) restrict access by North Korea to fi-
nancial services that could contribute to nu-
clear, missile, or other programs related to
the development of weapons of mass destruc-
tion;
(E) restrict North Korean shipping, includ-
ing the registration, reflagging, or insuring
of North Korean ships;
(F) prohibit, with limited exceptions,
North Korean exports of coal, precious met-
als, iron, vanadium, and rare earth minerals;
(G) prohibit the transfer to North Korea of
rocket, aviation, or jet fuel, as well as gaso-
line, condensates, and natural gas liquids;
(H) prohibit new work authorization for
North Korean laborers and require the repa-
triation of all North Korean laborers by De-
cember 2019;
(I) prohibit exports of North Korean food
and agricultural products, including seafood;
(J) prohibit joint ventures or cooperative
commercial entities or expanding joint ven-
tures with North Korea;
(K) prohibit exports of North Korean tex-
tiles;
(L) require member countries of the United
Nations to seize, inspect, and impound any
ship in its jurisdiction that is suspected of
violating Security Council resolutions with
respect to North Korea and to interdict and
inspect all cargo heading to or from North
Korea by land, sea, or air;
(M) limit the transfer to North Korea of re-
fined petroleum products and crude oil;
(N) ban the sale or transfer to North Korea
of industrial machinery, transportation vehi-
cles, electronics, iron, steel, and other met-
als;
(O) reduce North Korean diplomatic staff
numbers in member countries of the United
Nations and expel any North Korean dip-
lomats found to be working on behalf of a
person subject to sanctions or assisting in
sanctions evasion;
(P) limit North Korean diplomatic mis-
sions abroad with respect to staff size and
access to banking privileges and prohibit
commerce from being conducted out of North
Korean consular or diplomatic offices;
(Q) require member states of the United
Nations to close representative offices, sub-
sidiaries, and bank accounts in North Korea;
(R) prohibit countries from providing or re-
ceiving military training to or from North
Korea or hosting North Koreans for special-
ized teaching or training that could con-
tribute to the programs of North Korea re-
lated to the development of weapons of mass
destruction;
(S) ban countries from granting landing
and flyover rights to North Korean aircraft;
and
(T) prohibit trade in statuary of North Ko-
rean origin.
(2) The Government of North Korea has
threatened to carry out nuclear attacks
against the United States, South Korea, and
Japan.
(3) The Government of North Korea tested
its sixth and largest nuclear device on Sep-
tember 3, 2017.
(4) According to a report by the Inter-
national Atomic Energy Agency released in
August 2018, ‘‘The continuation and further
development of the DPRK’s nuclear pro-
gramme and related statements by the
DPRK are a cause for grave concern. The
DPRK’s nuclear activities, including those in
relation to the Yongbyon Experimental Nu-
clear Power Plant (5 MW(e)) reactor, the use
of the building which houses the reported
centrifuge enrichment facility and the con-
struction at the light water reactor, as well
as the DPRK’s sixth nuclear test, are clear
violations of relevant UN Security Council
resolutions, including resolution 2375 (2017)
and are deeply regrettable.’’.
(5) In July 2018, Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo testified to the Committee on For-
eign Relations of the Senate that North
Korea ‘‘continue[s] to produce fissile mate-
rial’’ despite public pledges by North Korean
leader Kim Jong-un to denuclearize.
(6) The 2019 Missile Defense Review con-
ducted by the Department of Defense states
that North Korea ‘‘continues to pose an ex-
traordinary threat and the United States
must remain vigilant. In the past, North
Korea frequently issued explicit nuclear mis-
sile threats against the United States and al-
lies, all the while working aggressively to
field the capability to strike the U.S. home-
land with nuclear-armed ballistic missiles.
Over the past decade, it has invested consid-
erable resources in its nuclear and ballistic
missile programs, and undertaken extensive
nuclear and missile testing in order to real-
ize the capability to threaten the U.S. home-
land with missile attack. As a result, North
Korea has neared the time when it could
credibly do so.’’.
(7) Financial transactions and investments
that provide financial resources to the Gov-
ernment of North Korea, and that fail to in-
corporate adequate safeguards against the
misuse of those financial resources, pose an
undue risk of contributing to—
(A) weapons of mass destruction programs
of that Government; and
(B) efforts to evade restrictions required by
the United Nations Security Council on im-
ports or exports of arms and related mate-
riel, services, or technology by that Govern-
ment.
(8) The Federal Bureau of Investigation has
determined that the Government of North
Korea was responsible for cyberattacks
against entities in the United States, South
Korea, and around the world.
(9) In November 2017, President Donald
Trump designated the government of North
Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism pursu-
ant to authorities under the Export Adminis-
tration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et
seq.), as continued in effect at the time
under the International Emergency Eco-
nomic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)),
the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C.
2151 et seq.), and the Arms Export Control
Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.);
(10) On February 22, 2018, the Secretary of
State determined that the Government of
North Korea was responsible for the lethal
nerve agent attack in 2017 on Kim Jong Nam,
the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim
Jong-un, in Malaysia, triggering sanctions
required under the Chemical and Biological
Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination
Act of 1991 (22 U.S.C. 5601 et seq.).
(11) The strict enforcement of sanctions is
essential to the efforts of the international
community to achieve the peaceful, com-
plete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantle-
ment of weapons of mass destruction pro-
grams of the Government of North Korea.
SEC. 1712. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) the United States is committed to
working with its allies and partners to halt
the nuclear and ballistic missile programs of
North Korea through a policy of maximum
pressure and diplomatic engagement;
(2) the imposition of sanctions, including
those under this title, should not be con-
strued to limit the authority of the Presi-
dent to fully engage in diplomatic negotia-
tions to further the policy objective de-
scribed in paragraph (1);
(3) the successful use of sanctions to halt
the nuclear and ballistic missile programs of
North Korea is part of a broader diplomatic
and economic strategy that relies on effec-
tive coordination among relevant Federal
agencies and officials, as well as with inter-
national partners of the United States; and
(4) the coordination described in paragraph
(3) should include proper vetting of external
messaging and communications from all
parts of the Executive branch to ensure that
those communications are an intentional
component of and aligned with the strategy
of the United States with respect to North
Korea.

if—
(A) the fiduciary makes that determina-
tion using credible information that is avail-
able to the public; and

ance of investment would not be expected to
provide the employee benefit plan with—

investments with commensurate rates of re-
turn; and

Subtitle C—Financial Industry Guidance to
Halt Trafficking
SEC. 1761. SHORT TITLE.
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Finan-
cial Industry Guidance to Halt Trafficking
Act’’ or the ‘‘FIGHT Act’’.
SEC. 1762. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) The terms ‘‘human trafficking’’ and
‘‘trafficking in persons’’ are used inter-
changeably to describe crimes involving the
exploitation of a person for the purposes of
compelled labor or commercial sex through
the use of force, fraud, or coercion.
(2) According to the International Labour
Organization, there are an estimated
24,900,000 people worldwide who are victims
of forced labor, including human trafficking
victims in the United States.
(3) Human trafficking is perpetrated for fi-
nancial gain.
(4) According to the International Labour
Organization, of the estimated
$150,000,000,000 or more in global profits gen-
erated annually from human trafficking—
(A) approximately 2⁄3 are generated by com-
mercial sexual exploitation, exacted by fraud
or by force; and
(B) approximately 1⁄3 are generated by
forced labor.
(5) Most purchases of commercial sex acts
are paid for with cash, making trafficking
proceeds difficult to identify in the financial
system. Nonetheless, traffickers rely heavily
on access to financial institutions as des-
tinations for trafficking proceeds and as con-
duits to finance every step of the trafficking
process.
(6) Under section 1956 of title 18, United
States Code (relating to money laundering),
human trafficking is a ‘‘specified unlawful
activity’’ and transactions conducted with
proceeds earned from trafficking people, or
used to further trafficking operations, can be
prosecuted as money laundering offenses.
SEC. 1763. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) the President should aggressively apply,
as appropriate, existing sanctions for human
trafficking authorized under section 111 of
the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of
2000 (22 U.S.C. 7108);
(2) the Financial Crimes Enforcement Net-
work of the Department of the Treasury
should continue—
(A) to monitor reporting required under
subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United
States Code (commonly known as the ‘‘Bank
Secrecy Act’’) and to update advisories, as
warranted;
(B) to periodically review its advisories to
provide covered financial institutions, as ap-
propriate, with a list of new ‘‘red flags’’ for
identifying activities of concern, particu-
larly human trafficking;
(C) to encourage entities covered by the
advisories described in subparagraph (B) to
incorporate relevant elements provided in
the advisories into their current transaction
and account monitoring systems or in poli-
cies, procedures, and training on human traf-
ficking to enable financial institutions to
maintain ongoing efforts to examine trans-
actions and accounts;
(D) to use geographic targeting orders, as
appropriate, to impose additional reporting
and recordkeeping requirements under sec-
tion 5326(a) of title 31, United States Code, to
carry out the purposes of, and prevent eva-
sions of the Bank Secrecy Act; and
(E) to utilize the Bank Secrecy Act Advi-
sory Group and other relevant entities to
identify opportunities for nongovernmental
organizations to share relevant actionable
information on human traffickers’ use of the
financial sector for nefarious purposes;
(3) Federal banking regulators, the Depart-
ment of the Treasury, relevant law enforce-
ment agencies, and the Human Smuggling
and Trafficking Center, in partnership with
representatives from the United States fi-
nancial community, should adopt regular
forms of sharing information to disrupt
human trafficking, including developing pro-
tocols and procedures to share actionable in-
formation between and amongst covered in-
stitutions, law enforcement, and the United
States intelligence community;
(4) training front line bank and money
service business employees, school teachers,
law enforcement officers, foreign service offi-
cers, counselors, and the general public is an
important factor in identifying trafficking
victims;
(5) the Department of Homeland Security’s
Blue Campaign, training by the BEST Em-
ployers Alliance, and similar efforts by in-
dustry, human rights, and nongovernmental
organizations focused on human trafficking
provide good examples of current efforts to
educate employees of critical sectors to save
victims and disrupt trafficking networks;
(6) the President should intensify diplo-
matic efforts, bilaterally and in appropriate
international fora, such as the United Na-
tions, to develop and implement a coordi-
nated, consistent, multilateral strategy for
addressing the international financial net-
works supporting human trafficking; and
(7) in deliberations between the United
States Government and any foreign country,
including through participation in the
Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence
Units, regarding money laundering, corrup-
tion, and transnational crimes, the United
States Government should—
(A) encourage cooperation by foreign gov-
ernments and relevant international fora in
identifying the extent to which the proceeds
from human trafficking are being used to fa-
cilitate terrorist financing, corruption, or
other illicit financial crimes;
(B) encourage cooperation by foreign gov-
ernments and relevant international fora in
identifying the nexus between human traf-
ficking and money laundering;
(C) advance policies that promote the co-
operation of foreign governments, through
information sharing, training, or other
measures, in the enforcement of this sub-
title;

SEC. 1247. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ACQUISITION
BY TURKEY OF S–400 AIR DEFENSE
SYSTEM.
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) Turkey is an important North Atlantic
Treaty Organization ally and military part-
ner;
(2) the acquisition by the Government of
Turkey of the S–400 air defense system from
the Russian Federation—
(A) undermines—
(i) the security interests of the United
States; and
(ii) the air defense of Turkey;
(B) weakens the interoperability of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization; and
(C) is incompatible with the plan of the
Government of Turkey—
(i) to accept delivery of and operate the F–
35 aircraft; and
(ii) to continue to participate in F–35 air-
craft production and maintenance;
(3) the United States and other member
countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Orga-
nization have put forth several viable and
competitive proposals to protect the vulner-
able airspace of Turkey and to ensure the se-
curity and integrity of Turkey as a North
Atlantic Treaty Organization ally;
(4) Russian Federation aggression on the
periphery of Turkey, including in Georgia,
Ukraine, the Black Sea, and Syria, and espe-
cially the indiscriminate bombing by the
Russian Federation of the Idlib province of
Syria on the border of Turkey and the incur-
sions of Russian Federation warplanes into
the airspace of Turkey on November 24, 2015,
and other occasions, endangers the security
of Turkey;
(5) the termination of the participation of
Turkey in the F–35 program and supply
chain, which may still be avoided if the Gov-
ernment of Turkey abandons its planned ac-
quisition of the S–400 air defense system,
would cause significant harm to the growing
defense industry and economy of Turkey;
and
(6) if the Government of Turkey accepts
delivery of the S–400 air defense system—
(A) such acceptance would—
(i) constitute a significant transaction
within the meaning of section 231(a) of the
Countering Russian Influence in Europe and
Eurasia Act of 2017 (22 U.S.C. 9525(a));
(ii) endanger the integrity of the North At-
lantic Treaty Organization Alliance and pose
a significant threat to Turkey;
(iii) adversely affect ongoing operations of
the United States Armed Forces, including
coalition operations in which the United
States Armed Forces participate;
(iv) result in a significant impact to de-
fense cooperation between the United States
and Turkey; and
(v) significantly increase the risk of com-
promising United States defense systems and
operational capabilities; and
(B) the President should fully implement
the Countering Russian Influence in Europe
and Eurasia Act of 2017 (Public Law 115–44;
131 Stat. 886) by imposing and applying sanc-
tions under section 235 of that Act (22 U.S.C.
9529) with respect to any individual or entity
determined to have engaged in such signifi-
cant transaction as if such person were a
sanctioned person for purposes of such sec-
tion.

SEC. 404. ENCOURAGING COOPERATIVE ACTIONS
TO DETECT AND COUNTER FOREIGN
INFLUENCE OPERATIONS.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) The Russian Federation, through mili-
tary intelligence units, also known as the
‘‘GRU’’, and Kremlin-linked troll organiza-
tions often referred to as the ‘‘Internet Re-
search Agency’’, deploy information warfare
operations against the United States, its al-
lies and partners, with the goal of advancing
the strategic interests of the Russian Fed-
eration.
(2) One line of effort deployed as part of
these information warfare operations is the
weaponization of social media platforms
with the goals of intensifying societal ten-
sions, undermining trust in governmental in-
stitutions within the United States, its allies
and partners in the West, and generally sow-
ing division, fear, and confusion.
(3) These information warfare operations
are a threat to the national security of the
United States and that of the allies and part-
ners of the United States. As Director of Na-
tional Intelligence Dan Coats stated, ‘‘These
actions are persistent, they are pervasive
and they are meant to undermine America’s
democracy.’’.
(4) These information warfare operations
continue to evolve and increase in sophis-
tication.
(5) Other foreign adversaries and hostile
non-state actors will increasingly adopt
similar tactics of deploying information war-
fare operations against the West.
(6) Technological advances, including arti-
ficial intelligence, will only make it more
difficult in the future to detect fraudulent
accounts, deceptive material posted on so-
cial media, and malign behavior on social
media platforms.
(7) Because these information warfare op-
erations are deployed within and across pri-
vate social media platforms, the companies
that own these platforms have a responsi-
bility to detect and remove foreign adver-
sary networks operating clandestinely on
their platforms.
(8) The social media companies are inher-
ently technologically sophisticated and
adept at rapidly analyzing large amounts of
data and developing software-based solutions
to diverse and ever-changing challenges on
their platforms, which makes them well-
equipped to address the threat occurring on
their platforms.
(9) Independent analyses confirmed Krem-
lin-linked threat networks, based on data
provided by several social media companies
to the Select Committee on Intelligence of
the Senate, thereby demonstrating that it is
possible to discern both broad patterns of
cross-platform information warfare oper-
ations and specific fraudulent behavior on
social media platforms.
(10) General Paul Nakasone, Director of
the National Security Agency, emphasized
the importance of these independent anal-
yses to the planning and conduct of military
cyber operations to frustrate Kremlin-linked
information warfare operations against the
2018 mid-term elections. General Nakasone
stated that the reports ‘‘were very, very
helpful in terms of being able to understand
exactly what our adversary was trying to do
to build dissent within our nation.’’.
(11) Institutionalizing ongoing robust,
independent, and vigorous analysis of data
related to foreign threat networks within
and across social media platforms will help
counter ongoing information warfare oper-
ations against the United States, its allies,
and its partners.
(12) Archiving and disclosing to the public
the results of these analyses by the social
media companies and trusted third-party ex-
perts in a transparent manner will serve to
demonstrate that the social media compa-
nies are detecting and removing foreign ma-
lign activities from their platforms while
protecting the privacy of the people of the

United States and will build public under-
standing of the scale and scope of these for-
eign threats to our democracy, since expo-
sure is one of the most effective means to
build resilience.
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense
of the Senate that—
(1) the social media companies should co-
operate among themselves and with inde-
pendent organizations and researchers on a
sustained and regular basis to share and ana-
lyze data and indicators relevant to foreign
information warfare operations within and
across their platforms in order to detect and
counter foreign information warfare oper-
ations that threaten the national security of
the United States and its allies and partners;
(2) these analytic efforts should be orga-
nized in such a fashion as to meet the high-
est standards of ethics, confidentiality, and
privacy protection of the people of the
United States;
(3) these analytic efforts should be under-
taken as soon as possible to facilitate coun-
tering ongoing Kremlin, Kremlin-linked, and
other foreign information warfare operations
and to aid in preparations for the United
States presidential and congressional elec-
tions in 2020 and beyond;
(4) the structure and operations of social
media companies make them well positioned
to address foreign adversary threat networks
within and across their platforms, and these
efforts could be conducted without direct
Government involvement, direction, or regu-
lation; and
(5) if the social media industry fails to
take sufficient action to address foreign ad-
versary threat networks operating within or
across their platforms, Congress would have
to consider additional safeguards for ensur-
ing that this threat is effectively mitigated.

MENT OF SOCIAL MEDIA DATA ANALYSIS CEN-
TER.—
(1) AUTHORITY.—The Director of National
Intelligence, in coordination with the Sec-

(C) provides an exception for certain popu-
lations if the Security Executive Agent—
(i) determines such populations require re-
investigations at regular intervals; and
(ii) provides written justification to the
appropriate congressional committees for
any such determination.
(4) A policy and implementation plan for
agencies and departments of the United
States, as a part of the security clearance
process, to accept automated records checks

Subtitle H—Western Hemisphere Security
Initiative
SEC. 1291. SHORT TITLE.
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘2020
Western Hemisphere Security Initiative
Act’’.
SEC. 1292. FINDINGS.
Congress makes the following findings:
(1) The stability and security of the West-
ern Hemisphere directly impacts the secu-
rity of the United States. The nations of the
hemisphere are connected in every domain.
Our partnerships are vital to security and
prosperity in this hemisphere, and to our
ability to meet complex global challenges.
The security and prosperity of future genera-
tions depend on our trust and cooperation.
(2) The Western Hemisphere is home to
more than 1,000,000,000 people and largely
unified by respect for democracy and human
rights that is shared by nearly all nations in
the hemisphere.
(3) The United States is in competition
with China and other aspiring global powers
in the Western Hemisphere. China has accel-
erated expansion of its One Belt One Road
Initiative at a pace that may one day over-
shadow its expansion in Southeast Asia and
Africa. Russia supports regional information
outlets that spread its false narrative of
world events and United States intentions.
Iran has exported its state support for ter-
rorism to the hemisphere. China and Russia
also support autocratic regimes in Ven-
ezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua, who are
counter to democracy and United States in-
terests.
(4) The Western Hemisphere continues to
experience high levels of corruption, vio-
lence, trafficking in drugs and other illicit
commodities, and illegal migration resulting
from weak institutions and instability. Sev-
enteen of the top 20 most violent countries
in the world are in Central America, the Car-
ibbean, and South America.
(5) The United States National Security
Strategy, which was released in December
2017, states the following:
(A) ‘‘Stable, friendly, and prosperous states
in the Western Hemisphere enhance our se-
curity and benefit our economy. Democratic
states connected by shared values and eco-
nomic interests will reduce the violence,
drug trafficking and illegal immigration
that threaten our common security, and will
limit opportunities for adversaries to oper-
ate from areas of close proximity to us.’’
(B) ‘‘The United States also has important
and deepening relationships with key coun-
tries in the region. Together we will build a
stable and peaceful hemisphere that in-
creases economic opportunities for all, im-
proves governance, reduces the power of
criminal organizations, and limits the ma-
lign influence of non-hemispheric forces.’’
(C) ‘‘U.S. agencies and foreign partners will
target transnational criminal organization
leaders and their support infrastructure. We
will assist countries, particularly in the
Western Hemisphere, to break the power of
these organizations and networks.’’
(6) The ‘‘Summary of the 2018 National De-
fense Strategy of the United States of Amer-
ica’’ which was released in January 2018,
states, ‘‘The U.S. derives immense benefit
from a stable, peaceful hemisphere that re-
duces security threats to the homeland. Sup-
porting the U.S. interagency lead, the De-
partment will deepen its relations with re-
gional countries that contribute military ca-
pabilities to shared regional and global secu-
rity challenges.’’
(7) The United States homeland is phys-
ically and geographically connected with
Latin America and the Caribbean across all
domains—sea, air, land, space, and cyber.
Any challenges in the region affect the
United States and can quickly become
threats to our national security.
(8) The drugs that pour into the United
States, killing thousands of Americans every
year, largely enter from Latin America and
the Caribbean. Drug overdoses killed more
than 70,000 United States citizens in 2017, and
treating drug abuse cost United States tax-
payers over $30,000,000,000 in 2015. In order to
stop this epidemic, the United States Gov-
ernment must address domestic consumption
and assist our partner nations in the region
in reducing local cultivation and manufac-
turing of narcotics while controlling their
own borders. And while interdictions of drug
shipments are at an all-time high, it’s still

only a small percentage of the known flow.
Additional United States and partner assets,
operational funding, coordination, and ca-
pacity building, along with intelligence and
data exploitation, can all contribute to re-
ducing this flow.
(9) In addition, we must assist in strength-
ening our partners’ institutions in order to
reduce corruption and extend governance. By
reducing the flow of drugs through Central
America—the primary transit zone—we will
also mitigate the drivers for extreme vio-
lence and corruption left in the wake of the
illegal drug trade. The vicious side effects of
illicit trade also cost American taxpayers
billions of dollars every year.
(10) Directly tied to the instability and in-
security associated with the flow of drugs
through Central America is the movement of
thousands of Central American migrants to-
ward the United States. Migrant flows be-
tween countries have also increased, strain-
ing partner nations’ capacity and straining
security and stability.
(11) Natural disasters and other humani-
tarian crises also increase instability and ex-
acerbate the causes of migration.
(12) As the United States Government has
focused—necessarily—on other parts of the
world, the governments of countries like the
Russian Federation and the People’s Repub-
lic of China have increased their economic
and political focus in this hemisphere, deep-
ening their own relationships in an effort to
supplant United States security presence and
assistance, including through the following
activities:
(A) The Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China pledged at least $150,000,000,000 in
loans to countries in the hemisphere with
long-term consequences. Infrastructure in-
vestments in the Panama Canal region could
jeopardize United States, allied, and partner
access and transit through the region. Chi-
nese information technology investments in
the region place intellectual property, data,
and government security at risk, potentially
curtailing our ability to share information
with our key security partners.
(B) The Government of the Russian Fed-
eration established a Counter Transnational
Organized Crime (CTOC) Training Center in
Nicaragua, providing the Government with a
regional platform to recruit intelligence
sources and conduct collection activities.
The Government of the Russian Federation
also conducted disinformation campaigns,
publishing hundreds of articles in 2018 that
deliberately distorted United States defense
engagements. The Government of the Rus-
sian Federation has deployed strategic
bombers, warships, intelligence collection
ships, and underwater research vessels that
are capable of mapping and interfering with
undersea cables.
(13) The United States has a fundamental
interest in defending human rights and pro-
moting the rule of law in the Western Hemi-
sphere.
(14) Intelligent and focused investments in
the United States Armed Forces and security
assistance yield meaningful results with
partners able to secure their own countries
and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the
United States to address threats to our mu-
tual security interests.
(15) Given the lack of direct military
threats in the Western Hemisphere, the
United States Government has taken the rel-
ative stability and democratic progress of
the region for granted. Recent developments
demonstrate that this is dangerous:
(A) There are now four countries in the re-
gion whose ruling parties do not share
United States values and who actively seek
to undermine democratic stability. The Gov-
ernments of Cuba, Venezuela, Bolivia, and
Nicaragua enable Russian and Chinese mili-
tary deployments to the region, allowing
those two actors access to infrastructure and
the potential ability to impede United
States, allied, and partner nation efforts in
the event of contingencies.
(B) Support from the Governments of the
Russian Federation and the People’s Repub-
lic of China for autocratic Governments in
Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Bolivia en-
ables anti-democratic sentiment and threat-
ens United States security interests in the
region.
(16) The United States has many strong, es-
tablished partnerships to assist us in advanc-
ing shared objectives in this hemisphere. The
United States Government must renew focus
on our own hemisphere to stop these chal-
lenges and threats as far away as possible be-
fore they reach our borders and shores, and
strengthen the security partnerships critical
to ensuring our hemisphere remains a beacon
of peace and stability.
SEC. 1293. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) the security, stability, and prosperity of
the Western Hemisphere region are vital to
the national interests of the United States;
(2) the United States should continue to
engage in the Western Hemisphere by
strengthening alliances and partnerships,
working with regional institutions, address-
ing the shared challenges of illicit traf-
ficking of humans, drugs, and other contra-
band, transnational criminal organizations,
and supporting the rule of law and democ-
racy in the region;
(3) the United States should maintain a
military presence and capability in the
Western Hemisphere region that can project
power, build partner capacity, provide hu-
manitarian assistance and large scale dis-
aster relief, deter acts of aggression, and re-
spond, if necessary, to regional threats or to
threats to the national security of the
United States from China, Russia, Iran,
transnational criminal organizations, vio-
lent extremists, or autocratic regimes;
(4) continuing efforts by the Department of
Defense to commit additional assets and in-
crease investments to the Western Hemi-
sphere are necessary to maintain a robust
United States commitment to the region;
(5) the Secretary of Defense should—
(A) assess the current United States force
posture in the Western Hemisphere to ensure
that the United States maintains an appro-
priate and consistent presence in the region,
including by—
(i) prioritizing intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance assets;
(ii) increasing aerial and maritime domain
awareness by exploring commercially avail-
able options in addition to traditional
means;
(iii) increasing deployment of surface and
air assets and making available operating
funds to cultivate multi-national participa-
tion in security activities, including multi-
national military exercises and training; and
(iv) providing a continuous United States
Navy presence with humanitarian assistance
and disaster relief as well as drug interdic-
tion-capable platforms;
(B) exploit innovative solutions, including
data analytics and use of emerging tech-
nologies such as machine learning, to illu-
minate and target corruption and illicit net-
works;
(C) compete in the information domain, in-
cluding by—
(i) exploiting publicly available informa-
tion; and
(ii) sharing signals and insights into state
and non-state destabilizing activities;
(D) develop strategic options to expand the
competitive space in Latin America and the
Caribbean;
(E) streamline security cooperation proc-
esses;
(F) enhance regional force readiness
through joint training and exercises; and
(G) continue to build interoperability to
address threats in space and cyberspace;
(6) the Secretary of State should—
(A) increase the designation of Inter-
national Military and Education Training
(IMET) funding for use by countries in the
Western Hemisphere because education and
training activities are force multipliers, pro-
viding partners with mutual understanding,
shared values, interoperability of forces, and
deepen relationships lasting generations; and
(B) increase Foreign Military Financing
within the United States Southern Command
(USSOUTHCOM) area of responsibility to
adequately match requirements; and
(7) Congress should provide additional
funds for use by USSOUTHCOM in con-
tracting solutions to mitigate gaps in capa-
bilities.

TITLE XVII—SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT
TO FOREIGN TRAFFICKERS OF ILLICIT
SYNTHETIC OPIOIDS
SEC. 1701. SHORT TITLE.
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Fentanyl
Sanctions Act’’.
SEC. 1702. FINDINGS.
Congress makes the following findings:
(1) The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention estimate that from September
2017 through September 2018 more than 48,200
people in the United States died from an
opioid overdose, with synthetic opioids (ex-
cluding methadone), contributing to a record
31,900 overdose deaths. While drug overdose
death estimates from methadone, semi-syn-
thetic opioids, and heroin have decreased in
recent months, overdose deaths from syn-
thetic opioids have continued to increase.
(2) Congress and the President have taken
a number of actions to combat the demand
for illicit opioids in the United States, in-
cluding enacting into law the SUPPORT for
Patients and Communities Act (Public Law
115–271; 132 Stat. 3894). While new statutes
and regulations have reduced the rate of
opioid prescriptions in recent years, fully ad-
dressing the United States opioid crisis will
involve dramatically restricting the foreign
supply of illicit opioids.
(3) The People’s Republic of China is the
world’s largest producer of illicit fentanyl,
fentanyl analogues, and their immediate pre-
cursors. From the People’s Republic of
China, those substances are shipped pri-
marily through express consignment carriers
or international mail directly to the United
States, or, alternatively, shipped directly to
transnational criminal organizations in Mex-
ico, Canada, and the Caribbean.
(4) The United States and the People’s Re-
public of China, Mexico, and Canada have
made important strides in combating the il-
licit flow of opioids through bilateral efforts
of their respective law enforcement agencies.
(5) The objective of preventing the pro-
liferation of illicit opioids though existing
multilateral and bilateral initiatives re-
quires additional efforts to deny illicit ac-
tors the financial means to sustain their
markets and distribution networks.
(6) The implementation on May 1, 2019, of
the regulations of the People’s Republic of
China to schedule all fentanyl analogues as
controlled substances is a major step in com-
bating global opioid trafficking and rep-
resents a major achievement in United
States-China law enforcement dialogues.
However, that step will effectively fulfill the
commitment that President Xi Jinping of
the People’s Republic of China made to
President Donald Trump at the Group of
Twenty meeting in December 2018 only if the
Government of the People’s Republic of
China devotes sufficient resources to full im-
plementation and strict enforcement of the
new regulations. The effective enforcement
of the new regulations should result in di-
minished trafficking of illicit fentanyl origi-
nating from the People’s Republic of China
into the United States, so it is in the inter-
ests of both the United States and the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China to support the effec-
tive enforcement of the regulations.
(7) While the Department of the Treasury
used the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designa-
tion Act (21 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) to sanction
the first synthetic opioid trafficking entity
in April 2018, additional economic and finan-
cial sanctions policy tools are needed to help
combat the flow of synthetic opioids into the
United States.
SEC. 1703. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) the United States should apply eco-
nomic and other financial sanctions to for-
eign traffickers of illicit opioids to protect
the national security, foreign policy, and
economy of the United States and the health
of the people of the United States;
(2) it is imperative that the People’s Re-
public of China follow through on full imple-
mentation of the new regulations, adopted
May 1, 2019, to treat all fentanyl analogues
as controlled substances under the laws of
the People’s Republic of China, including by
devoting sufficient resources for implemen-
tation and strict enforcement of the new reg-
ulations; and
(3) the effective enforcement of the new
regulations should result in diminished traf-
ficking of illicit fentanyl originating from
the People’s Republic of China into the
United States, so it is in the interests of
both the United States and the People’s Re-
public of China to support full, effective, and
strict enforcement of the regulations.

ply base are especially vulnerable to signifi-
cant changes in funding for acquisition pro-
grams; and

avoid, to the extent possible, drastic acquisi-
tion program changes in order to provide
more predictability and opportunities for de-
fense suppliers, particularly small busi-
nesses, to adapt.

fiscal year, and for other purposes;
which was ordered to lie on the table;
as follows:
At the end of subtitle D of title XII, add
the following:
SEC. 1247. SENSE OF SENATE ON MULTI-
NATIONAL FREEDOM OF NAVIGA-
TION IN THE BLACK SEA AND THE
CANCELLATION OF THE NORD
STREAM 2 PIPELINE.
(a) FINDINGS.—The Senate makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) In late February 2014, the Russian Fed-
eration invaded and illegally occupied
Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula, in full con-
travention of the United Nations Charter
and the Helsinki Final Act, which condemn
the threat or use of force as means of alter-
ing international borders.
(2) The Russian Federation’s attempted il-
legal annexation of Crimea is also a direct
violation of its pledges as a signatory to the
1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security As-
surances to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty
and existing borders and to refrain from the
threat or use of force against Ukraine.
(3) The inclusion of the United States and
the United Kingdom as signatories to the
Budapest Memorandum was essential in
order to provide Ukraine the security assur-
ances needed to give up its nuclear arsenal.
(4) On November 25, 2018, military forces of
the Russian Federation attacked and seized
three Ukrainian Navy vessels and their
crews as the vessels attempted to transit the
Kerch Strait between the Black Sea and the
Sea of Azov.
(5) The Government of the Russian Federa-
tion still has not released the Ukrainian
crew members or returned the Ukrainian
ships that were seized illegally.
(6) European Commissioner Julian King
stated that the Government of the Russian
Federation launched a disinformation cam-
paign over a year ago designed to paint
Ukraine and NATO as provocateurs in the
Kerch Strait.
(7) As part of the Russian Federation
disinformation campaign, Russian state
media outlets spread demonstrable false-
hoods, including claims that Ukraine was
dredging the Kerch Strait seabed to facili-
tate the stationing of a NATO fleet, that
Ukraine had intentionally infected the sea
with cholera, and that Ukrainian and British
clandestine services were conspiring to de-
stroy the Kerch Strait bridge with a nuclear
weapon.
(8) The United States has important na-
tional interests in the Black Sea region, in-
cluding the security of three NATO littoral
states, the promotion of European energy
market diversification by ensuring unfet-
tered European access to energy exporters in
the Caucuses and central Asia, and com-
bating use of the region by smugglers as a
conduit for trafficking in persons, narcotics,
and arms.
(9) The Nord Stream 2 pipeline is a pro-
posed underwater natural gas pipeline
project that would provide an additional
55,000,000,000 cubic meters of pipeline capac-
ity from the Russian Federation to the Fed-
eral Republic of Germany through the Baltic
Sea.
(10) The Russian Federation’s state-owned
oil and gas company, Gazprom, is the sole
shareholder of the Nord Stream 2 project.
(11) In 2017, there was spare capacity of ap-
proximately 55,000,000,000 cubic meters in the
Ukrainian gas transit system.
(12) Gazprom cut off natural gas exports to
Europe via Ukraine in 2006, and again in 2009,
over supply and pricing disputes with
Ukraine’s state-owned oil and gas company,
Naftogaz.
(13) Transit of Russian natural gas to Eu-
rope via Ukraine declined precipitously after
the completion of Nord Stream 1 in 2011, fall-
ing from 80 percent to between 40 and 50 per-
cent of Russia’s total exports to Europe.
(14) In 2017, Russian gas accounted for 37
percent of Europe’s natural gas imports, an
increase of 5 percent over 2016.
(15) On December 12, 2018, the European
Parliament overwhelmingly passed a resolu-
tion condemning both the Russian Federa-
tion’s aggression in the Kerch Strait and the
construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
(16) On December 11, 2018, the United
States House of Representatives passed a
resolution calling upon the European Union

At the end of subtitle C of title XII, add
the following:
SEC. 12lll. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON REPATRI-
ATION OF RELIGIOUS AND ETHNIC
MINORITIES IN IRAQ TO ANCESTRAL
HOMELANDS.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) The Nineveh Plain and the wider region
have been the ancestral homeland of Assyr-
ian Chaldean Syriac Christians, Yazidis,
Shabak, and other religious and ethnic mi-
norities, where they lived for centuries until
the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)
overran and occupied the area in 2014.
(2) In 2016, then Secretary of State John
Kerry announced, ‘‘In my judgment Daesh is
responsible for genocide against groups in
areas under its control, including Yezidis,
Christians, and Shia Muslims. Daesh is geno-
cidal by self-proclamation, by ideology, and
by actions – in what it says, what it believes,
and what it does. Daesh is also responsible
for crimes against humanity and ethnic
cleansing directed at these same groups and
in some cases also against Sunni Muslims,
Kurds, and other minorities.’’.
(3) These atrocities were undertaken with
the specific intent to bring about the eradi-
cation and displacement of Christians,
Yazidis, and other communities and the de-
struction of their cultural heritage, in viola-
tion of the United Nations Convention on the
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of
Genocide.
(4) In 2016, the Senate passed S. Res. 340
(114th Congress), expressing the sense of the
Senate that the atrocities perpetrated by the
Islamic State of Iraq and Syria against reli-
gious and ethnic minorities in Iraq and Syria
include war crimes, crimes against human-
ity, and genocide.
(5) It is consistent with the commitments
of the Republic of Iraq, the Kurdish Regional
Government, the United States, and the
international community to guarantee the
restoration of fundamental human rights, in-
cluding property rights, to genocide victims,
and to see that ethnic and religious plu-
ralism survives in Iraq.
(6) President Trump issued orders to defeat
the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, and with
the joint efforts of the United States and 79
allies and partners, the Islamic State of Iraq
and Syria, which once controlled large
swaths of territory in both Iraq and Syria,
no longer controls any physical territory.
(7) In July 2018, under the direction of Vice
President Pence, the Genocide Recovery and
Persecution Response Program has
partnered the Department of State and the
United States Agency for International De-
velopment with local faith and community
leaders to rapidly deliver aid to persecuted
communities, beginning with Iraq.
(8) Christians in Iraq once numbered over
1,500,000 in 2003, and have dwindled to less
than 200,000 today.
(9) Armed militia groups linked to Iran and
operating in Sinjar and the Nineveh Plains
are increasing the instability and insecurity
of Northern Iraq, preventing the conditions
for local and indigenous minorities to return
to their homelands.
(10) Facilitating the success of commu-
nities in Sinjar and the Nineveh Plains re-
quires a commitment from international,
Iraqi, Kurdish and local authorities, in part-
nership with local faith leaders, to promote
the safety and security of all people, espe-
cially religious and ethnic minorities.
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of
Congress that—
(1) it should be a policy priority of the
United States, working with international
partners, the Government of Iraq, the
Kurdistan Regional Government, and local
populations to support the safe return of dis-
placed indigenous people of the Nineveh
Plain and Sinjar to their ancestral home-
land;
(2) Iraqi Security Forces and the Kurdish
Peshmerga should work to more fully inte-
grate all communities, including religious
communities, to counter current and future
terrorist threats; and
(3) the United States, working with inter-
national allies and partners, should coordi-
nate efforts to provide for the safe return
and future security of religious minorities in
the Nineveh Plain and Sinjar.

SEC. 3116. MODIFICATION TO CERTAIN REQUIRE-
MENTS RELATING TO PLUTONIUM
PIT PRODUCTION CAPACITY.
(a) FINDINGS.—The Senate makes the fol-
lowing findings:
(1) In testimony before the Committee on
Armed Services of the Senate on February
26, 2019, General John Hyten, Commander of
United States Strategic Command, stated,
‘‘The highest NNSA infrastructure priority
is re-establishing a plutonium pit production
and fabrication capacity to meet deterrent
requirements. Our national requirement,
supported by numerous studies and analyses,
requires no fewer than 80 war-reserve pits
per year by 2030. I support the NNSA plan to
achieve this.’’.
(2) At a press briefing on May 10, 2019,
Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition
and Sustainment Ellen Lord stated, ‘‘We
need 30 plutonium pits by 2026 for GBSD, and
we need to get 80 pits per year by 2030.’’.
(3) The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review stated
that a delay beyond 2030 in reaching the ca-
pacity to produce 80 plutonium pits per year
‘‘would result in the need for a higher rate of
pit production at higher cost’’.
(4) The National Nuclear Security Admin-
istration has proposed to meet this require-
ment by continuing to expand infrastructure
at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Al-
amos, New Mexico, which will remain the
Plutonium Center of Excellence, while build-
ing additional capacity at the Savannah
River Site, Aiken, South Carolina.
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense
of the Senate that—
(1) rebuilding a robust plutonium pit pro-
duction infrastructure is critical to main-
taining the viability of the nuclear stock-
pile;
(2) that effort will require cooperation
from experts at the Savannah River Site,
Los Alamos National Laboratory, and across
the nuclear security enterprise; and
(3) any further delay to planning and de-
sign for the full plutonium pit production en-
terprise will result in unacceptable capa-
bility gap for future stockpile stewardship
efforts.
(c) MODIFICATION TO REQUIREMENTS.—Sec-
tion 4219 of the Atomic Energy Defense Act
(50 U.S.C. 2538a) is amended—
(1) in subsection (a), by striking paragraph
(5) and inserting the following:
‘‘(5) during 2030, produces not less than 80
war reserve plutonium pits.’’;
(2) by striking subsection (b);
(3) by redesignating subsections (c) and (d)
as subsections (b) and (c), respectively;
(4) in subsection (b), as redesignated by
paragraph (2), by striking ‘‘2027 (or, if the au-
thority under subsection (b) is exercised,
2029)’’ and inserting ‘‘2030’’; and

RECOGNIZING SOUTH 40
SMOKEHOUSE
Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, it is
said that the quickest route to a man’s
heart is through his stomach. I tried to
prove that today at lunch when I sup-
plied barbecue for all the Members of
the Senate, Republican and Demo-
cratic.
For the 11th year in a row, I have
done that, and I have done it for a very
specific reason. Tonight, when you lis-
ten to the news on ABC or NBC or you
read the newspaper, they will talk
about a do-nothing Congress, and they
will talk about how we never do any-
thing and we don’t get along and how
we don’t work, when, in fact, I know,
because I have been here a long time,
we work pretty hard. Now, we have a
difficult time getting results some-
times, but that is because the issues
are tough.
When you feed a man barbecue, and
you have a tough issue to handle, you
have a chance of getting it done, and
tonight we did that.
All but three Members of the Senate
were there, stayed the whole time, and
the barbecue was outstanding. I want
to pay tribute to the people from Mari-
etta, GA, my hometown, who drove
here for 2 nights and then cooked all
night last night so the barbecue was
absolutely fresh today when the Senate
had it.
Dale Thornton is here, and Dale and
his wife Tracey have a catering busi-
ness called the South 40 Smokehouse in
Marietta, GA. If you have ever eaten
good barbecue that has the best rub,
the best smoke, best tenderness, best
temperature, South 40 has it. They are
fantastic.
Dale has been a good friend of mine
for a time and was here last year, here
this year, and has been here many
years before, and all I have had all day
long is people coming by and saying: Is
there anything I can do for you? So I
want my constituents to know I wasn’t
wasting my time eating barbecue. I
was gaining good points from my Mem-
bers so if I need a vote I can get it.
That is not any way of using influence,
but it is a way of using barbecue.
I want to thank Dale and his group,
and I want to recognize all of them by
name because I think they are listen-
ing at this time: Dale Thornton, who is
the chief pitmaster; Tracey Thornton,
who is his chief, I might add, but she is
the chief and brains of the organiza-
tion; Charles Wells, retired Fulton
County Fire Department; Chief Todd
Houghton, pitmaster and Air Force
flight mechanic; Margaret Houghton;
Brian Rule, pitmaster; Jay Tinney,
pressmaster; Chuck Taylor, a 35-year
chef; Jeff Carson, 20-year veteran chef;
Kell Phelps, pitmaster; Janet Phelps;
and Raylyn Phelps, the daughter.
They drove up here from Marietta,
GA, about 700 miles away, to prepare
the best food you ever had to eat. Re-
publicans and Democrats shared eating
it all. We didn’t have to do the dishes.
So we ate all the food. We did it so we
can take the last half of this year and
work hard for the American people,
and I hope a byproduct is our working
together to find solutions for the
American people’s problems. After all,
our job is not about who has the best
food but who has the best ideas and
what is right for the American people,
and you can always find that when you
are working together.
I appreciate the time to recognize ev-
erybody from South 40. I thank South
40 for what they did. I thank you all for
the barbecue. God bless all of you, and
God bless the United States of Amer-
ica.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska.
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I
thank my good friend and colleague
from Georgia, not just for the great
lunch that he put on today but for his
leadership and statesmanship.
I serve with him on the Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee. Talk about a com-
mittee that is actually getting things
done—bipartisan things done for Amer-
ican veterans. He is chairman of that
committee. He does a phenomenal job.
He is a great leader in the Senate, and
I thank him not just for the barbecue
today but for his wonderful work for
America and Georgia.

TRIBUTE TO JAKE ADAMS
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is
Thursday, and it is one of my favorite
times of the week because it is the
time that I take to come down to the
floor. The new pages are on the floor,
and I think you are going to start to
see this as probably one of your favor-
ite times as well because it is when I
talk about what we call the Alaskan of
the Week. It is an opportunity to high-
light somebody in my State who has
done something great for their commu-
nity, the State, and the country, and to
brag a little bit about Alaska.
Today I am going to talk about
Jacob Adams from Utqiagvik, formerly
known as Barrow, AK. He has been a
hero to so many in our State, including
me—a giant of an individual who has
spent his whole life in public service
for his culture, for his community, for
his State, and for his country.
Before I get started about Jake
Adams, let me talk a little bit about
what is going on in Alaska right now.
I know we all think we live in the
best States. Each of us likes to come
down and brag. That is a good thing.
But in Alaska, we certainly have a lot
of bragging rights on a whole host of
issues and a whole host of areas in
which we are very unique.
Right now, it is a beautiful time to
be in Alaska. We want tourists and ev-
eryone watching on TV to come to our
great State. Flowers are blooming, and
salmon are running up our rivers. Hun-
dreds of thousands—soon, literally mil-
lions—of salmon will be running. Ac-
cording to our Alaska Department of
Fish and Game, it is going to be a great
season for our reds.
Of course, the sun is our familiar
friend this time of year. In the north-
ern part of my State, in Utqiagvik, the
northernmost city in the entire United
States, it is not setting at all. The sun
is not setting at all. Midnight sun, pure
energy—it is amazing to experience.
We experience it, but we want everyone
else to come up and experience it.
Something else is going on in Alaska
in villages in the northern part of the
State around this time of year, a very
unique and special cultural tradition.
The spring whaling season in 11 com-
munities on the North Slope is wrap-
ping up. This spring, those 11 North
Slope communities were able to land 24
whales, equaling somewhere between
300 and 400 tons of highly nutritious
food for these wonderful communities.
That whale meat is then shared in vil-
lages throughout the whaling commu-
nities. It is an incredible Alaska Native
tradition that we are all in awe of.
We are now heading into Nalukataq
season. This is when communities get
together to celebrate this incredible
bounty and harvest. It is a special day,
a time of celebration and sharing. On
this day, successful whaling crews
share and feed the communities from
morning until night—whale, caribou
soup, goose and duck soup, and fish is
served to anyone and everyone who
comes. It is really, really special.
The community also celebrates with
a blanket toss, where people are tossed
high into the air. The seal skins sewed
together from the successful whale
hunts are used for the blanket. It is an-
other beautiful Alaska Native tradition
that Natives and non-Natives in our
State cherish.
There is a long list of people to thank
for keeping this incredible whaling and
Inupiaq culture and heritage alive in
Alaska, but Jake Adams is certainly on
the top of that list. He is a proud whal-
ing captain himself and a founding
member of the Alaska Eskimo Whaling
Commission, which has been the pri-
mary force in making sure that our
whaling communities continue to get
the quotas they need from the Inter-
national Whaling Commission to con-
tinue the practice and to feed their
people and keep this amazing cultural
heritage practice going.
It has not been easy, but they have
fought for self-determination, and they
have won repeatedly, including at a big
IWC meeting in Brazil last year.
It is because of Jake Adams’ incred-
ible leadership that this tradition is so
far advanced and revered in Alaska,
and, I would say, around the world.
Jake has done that and so much more
for his community and for people all

S3620 June 13, 2019
across the great State of Alaska. In
one word, he is a legend—a true leg-
end—for Alaska, and I am proud to
have him as a friend.
Jake’s accomplishments are too long
to list here, but let me spend a few
minutes highlighting just a few of
those accomplishments. Let me start
with his background.
He was born to Baxter and Rebecca
Adams in Utqiagvik in 1946. He was
raised in the tradition of the Inupiaq
people—respecting their elders and re-
vering the land and resources for his
spiritual, physical, and emotional sus-
tenance.
Like so many Alaska Natives, as a
boy he was sent away to school—far
away—to a school in Alaska called Mt.
Edgecumbe. It is thousands of miles
away, and it is a boarding school that
was run by BIA. Then, he went to the
University of Alaska Fairbanks, until
he got his first job with BIA.
All of this was at a time of great
change for the whole State of Alaska
and, particularly, for the Alaska Na-
tive people. While Jake was still a
young man, the Alaska Native Claims
Settlement Act, or what we call
ANCSA, was being debated in the halls
of Congress and right here on the floor
of the Senate. This ended up being one
of the largest lands settlements any-
where in the world—literally, in the
history of the world. It was right here
in the U.S. Senate. The story around
the passage of ANCSA in 1971, after
decades of struggle, is certainly one for
the ages.
Jake Adams, among so many others,
was highly involved in the passage of
this landmark legislation for Alaska,
and he was even more involved in the
implementation of ANCSA, which set
up shareholder-owned businesses with
land for the Alaska Native people,
what we call regional and village cor-
porations, throughout the State. Sto-
ries abound of him and other Native
leaders knocking on doors throughout
the region, making sure that people
were signed up as shareholders of these
new corporations.
When he was only 21, Jake was elect-
ed to the Barrow City Council, and he
began his long decades of public service
for Alaska and for his people. He then
served as mayor of the city from 1971
through 1977. Then, the North Slope
Borough was incorporated, the borough
on the north part of Alaska—bigger
than California. That was established,
and he was a leader for the North Slope
Borough in our State.
The Alaska Native corporation on
the North Slope, the Arctic Slope Re-
gional Corporation—or, as we call it in
Alaska, ASRC—is one of the great busi-
ness success stories in our State and, I
would say, in America. Many people
credit the work that Jake did at ASRC
for making it so successful. He worked
closely with many other great leaders
at ASRC and on the North Slope.
Oliver Leavitt certainly is another
great leader. In fact, the North Slope
Borough and the ASRC are organiza-
tions that have produced really won-
derful leaders for Alaska: Crawford
Patkotak, Rex Rock, Tara Sweeney,
and Richard Glenn.
But I am digressing here a little bit.
Let’s get back to Jake.
He was on the board of ASRC from
the very beginning and is still on the
board today, over 40 years. He was in-
volved in the selection of nearly 5 mil-
lion acres of land for that corporation
under the law passed by the Senate and
the House, with limited time and lim-
ited funds to do this. But he is a wise
man, and ASRC selected well. ASRC
land is rich in natural resources and
abundant in wildlife. Jake has always
been a strong proponent of making
sure those resources and that wildlife
form the basis for economic develop-
ment and a sustainable way of life.
‘‘Our lands are the basis for all of our
culture and all our wealth,’’ he likes to
say.
Eventually, Jake became the presi-
dent and CEO of ASRC. Under his lead-
ership, ASRC has grown and diversified
in terms of one of the top corporations,
certainly in Alaska and, I would say, in
the country, with thousands of employ-
ees, not just in Alaska, but all over.
He was able to do all of this while
still doing subsistence hunting and
raising a family of six with his wonder-
ful wife Lucille. He often conducted
business on his boat, in the North
Slope and overseas, while whaling. Not
many business leaders in America can
say that.
Jake once told a reporter:
The land and a sense of place remain ex-
tremely important to our people.
We truly do exist in two worlds. . . . Our
culture and the value of traditions are part
of our life every day, even as we pursue more
Western business type of activities.
He has done so much more for Alas-
ka, for his people, for our people: sup-
porting the Native sobriety movement
and working to eradicate illegal drugs
from Native villages. He has been in-
volved with the volunteer search and
rescue organization and is a huge advo-
cate for education.
In honor of Jake’s commitment to
education, the ASRC’s Alaska Edu-
cational Foundation created a scholar-
ship award in his name. The ‘‘Anagi
Leadership Award’’ is given each year
to a student, providing up to $24,000 for
tuition, fees, and college expenses.
At his retirement ceremony from ex-
ecutive leadership of ASRC in 2006, the
people of the North Slope Borough lit-
erally cried. He is that well respected.
For his many accomplishments last
year, he was awarded an honorary doc-
torate of law degree from the Univer-
sity of Alaska Fairbanks.
Jake Adams is a man of wisdom. I
have a story. When I was attorney gen-
eral, 10 years ago, I was dealing with a
particularly difficult situation. When I
worked out what I thought was a good
resolution, I flew to Utqiagvik to meet
with Jake to ask him if he agreed and,
importantly, if the community agreed.
I explained the situation. Importantly,
when I asked him what he thought, he
said he thought it would be a just reso-
lution and he would be supportive of it.
That meant so much to me, as Alaska’s
attorney general, getting his advice
and his wisdom.
Jake Adams is a man of few words,
but when he speaks, it is powerful and
people listen. He is a man of deep, deep
wisdom. Ask anyone who knows him,
and they will talk about his wisdom,
his natural leadership, his humility,
and his abiding love of the land, the
people, Alaska, and his family, which
now includes 13 grandchildren.
A few years ago at a celebration in
his honor, John Hopson, Jr., another
great Alaska Native leader from the
North Slope, talked about how much
Jake had contributed to his commu-
nity and Alaska.
He said:
Jake has also bridged the world between
traditional whaling captain and corporate
leader. A highly successful whaling captain,
he has also provided guidance to our North
Slope Borough and Arctic Slope Regional
Corporation as they matured as institutions.
He has filled these roles with deep resolve,
wisdom, and great foresight. And always, he
has acted with the highest honor toward his
family and his community.
Well said, John Hopson, Jr., about
Jake Adam.
Jake, thank you for all you have
done for us, for your community, and
for all Alaskans. Thank you for your
decades of service to Alaska and your
leadership.
Thank you, Lucille, for sharing him
with us.
Congratulations, again, on being our
Alaskan of the Week.
I yield the floor.

NEY). The Senator from Texas.
f
ANTI-SEMITISM
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, today, I
would like to thank Senator KAINE for
joining with me in introducing what
should hopefully be a simple but cru-
cially important matter for the Sen-
ate—to issue an unequivocal, direct,
and clear condemnation of all forms of
anti-Semitism.
Unfortunately, we are living in an
era where the need for a strong and
clear condemnation of anti-Semitism
has become acute. We are in the midst
of a wave of anti-Semitism seen both
here in the United States and all over
the world.
In just the last few years, we have
seen repeated anti-Semitic comments
made publicly, including insinuations
questioning the loyalty and the patri-
otism of American Jews. We have seen
physical violence against Jews, includ-
ing shootings in Jewish places of wor-
ship, such as the Tree of Life Syna-
gogue in Pittsburgh and the Chabad of
Poway. We have seen a wave of phys-
ical attacks against Jews in the streets
of New York. And we have seen the
growth on our college campuses of
movements to aggressively boycott
products made by Jews in Israel.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3621
June 13, 2019
As we have learned this week, things
have gotten so bad that the New York
Times has announced it will simply
stop running political cartoons in their
international edition after being criti-
cized and forced to apologize for re-
cently running a blatantly anti-Se-
mitic cartoon.
This resolution was also prompted,
unfortunately, by the inability of the
House of Representatives to come to-
gether and vote on a resolution
straightforwardly and directly con-
demning anti-Semitism.
Too many in political life have given
in to the extremes, including the em-
brace of boycotts and at times outright
hatred for Israel, the world’s only Jew-
ish state.
So when the House tried to condemn
anti-Semitism, sadly, they were in-
stead forced to water it down into a
general resolution decrying bigotry of
all sorts, listing every group they could
think of.
There is, of course, nothing wrong
with condemning bigotry and hatred in
general, but anti-Semitism is a unique
prejudice with a unique history that
has led to unique horrors throughout
history.
Jews today are the most targeted re-
ligious group in the United States for
hate crimes, according to the data
compiled by the FBI. We need to be
able to acknowledge that clearly and
directly, and that is what this resolu-
tion does.
This resolution outlines how ancient
forms of anti-Semitism continue to
live on today. It emphasizes that anti-
Semitism is a unique form of prejudice
stretching back millennia, and it con-
demns the modern form of those an-
cient prejudices. It talks about how,
for centuries, anti-Semitism has in-
cluded exactly what we are seeing here
today, including physical attacks
against Jews, attacks on the loyalty of
Jews, accusations of dual loyalty, cam-
paigns to boycott, to confiscate, or to
destroy Jewish businesses, and accusa-
tions that Jews use money to purchase
political power. These are all false and
vicious slurs.
This resolution also speaks to the
unique prejudice Jews here in America
experience, which we must acknowl-
edge. I would like to read one clause in
particular in the resolution: ‘‘[I]n the
United States, Jews have suffered from
systematic discrimination in the form
of exclusion from homeownership in
certain neighborhoods, prohibition
from staying in certain hotels, restric-
tions upon membership in private clubs
and other associations, limitations
upon admission to certain educational
institutions and other barriers to equal
justice under the law.’’
This is a shameful legacy, and it
makes it all the more incumbent that
we in the Senate speak in one voice
and stand resolved that the U.S. Sen-
ate condemns and commits to com-
bating all forms of anti-Semitism.
This bipartisan resolution has 56 co-
sponsors, including 14 Democratic Sen-
ators. I am particularly grateful to
Senator KAINE for his leadership, which
has been pivotal in bringing us to-
gether to speak united with one clear
voice, and I am hopeful that just mo-
ments from now the Senate will come
together and pass a clear denunciation
of anti-Semitism, 100 to 0, so that we
are clearly understood and clearly
heard.
With that, I yield to my friend Sen-
ator KAINE.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia.
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I applaud
my colleague for reaching out to see if
we could work together on this impor-
tant resolution—a resolution that,
coming to the Senate in 2013, as did my
colleague, neither of us believed we
would need to stand on the floor of this
body to introduce.
In August of 2017, students and their
families had just arrived in the town of
Charlottesville to move in at the Uni-
versity of Virginia. A close friend of
mine, Rabbi Jake Rubin, is the Hillel
rabbi at the University of Virginia. The
students and their families, many of
whom were coming to Charlottesville
or to Virginia for the first time, ex-
cited to begin their college career,
gathered with other Hillel students on
campus on a Friday, together with
members of the Charlottesville Jewish
community, for fellowship and worship.
Soon, they heard chants outside the
place where they were worshipping,
and they saw individuals dressed in a
sort of uniform of khaki pants and
white shirts, carrying torches and
marching. They were marching at
something that was a 2-day rally billed
as a Unite the Right rally. But it was
the words that were coming out of the
marchers’ mouths that terrified these
worshippers and students because what
they were chanting were slogans from
Nazi youth rallies from the 1930s:
‘‘Jews will not replace us,’’ ‘‘blood and
soil,’’ and other horrible and chilling
statements terrified these young peo-
ple and the adults who were with them.
The next day, this rally/riot contin-
ued—White supremacists, White na-
tionalists, neo-Nazis, and neo-Confed-
erates. An individual in a vehicle ran
his car into a crowd, injuring many and
killing Heather Heyer, a paralegal
from the Charlottesville area.
Two State troopers, both of whom I
knew because they were part of the
Governor’s security detail during my
tenure as Governor and also the tenure
of then-Governor McAuliffe, were pa-
trolling in a helicopter to try to pro-
vide order in a difficult situation.
Their helicopter went down, and both
of them were killed, trying to protect
public safety.
We didn’t think that would happen in
Virginia. We didn’t think that would
happen in the hometown of an arche-
typal American political leader who
believed that the First Amendment’s
guarantee of freedom of religion was
one of the most important things about
our country—that you could worship as
you like or not and not be preferred or
punished for the choice that you make.
Yet it did happen in Virginia. It did
happen in our country.
As my colleague mentioned, this day
was a day that extended a long history
of anti-Semitism in the country:
lynchings—the Leo Frank lynching in
Atlanta, GA, in the early 1900s—Jews
wrongly accused of crimes and then
killed, crimes that they didn’t commit;
American boycotts of Jewish busi-
nesses in Michigan in the 1930s; restric-
tive covenants that prohibited Jews
from moving into certain neighbor-
hoods; restrictions on access to coun-
try clubs and educational institutions;
bars that made it difficult to become
members of certain professions; and
even in addition to formal restrictions,
a culture of intolerance, a culture of
segregation that treated Jews as not
fully equal in this land of equality. I
had hoped that those days were behind
us.
But it is not just Charlottesville.
There is a Jewish day school, the
Gesher Day School a few miles from
here in Virginia, that experienced
bomb threats in 2017 and 2018. The Jew-
ish Community Center in Fairfax, VA,
has been repeatedly defaced with Nazi
graffiti and anti-Semitic graffiti. In a
heartening sign, when that happens,
the faith communities of Virginia—
Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, and
Baha’i—gather to scrub the graffiti off.
Yet this hasn’t happened just once; it
happens over and over again.
The shootings at the synagogue in
Pittsburgh; the shootings in California;
the assassination of Jewish senior citi-
zens at a senior center in Overland
Park, KS, near where my parents live;
the uptick in reported hate crimes
against Jews, as my colleague men-
tioned—hate crimes directed against
any religion in this country are often
directed against Jewish Americans. So
we stand at a time when, regardless of
where it comes from and regardless of
who perpetrates it, we have to ac-
knowledge that it is real, that it is
dangerous, and that it is growing.
Those of us in leadership positions
have to be able to stand against it as
firmly as we can.
I applaud my colleague for reaching
out to see if we could work on this to-
gether. This is a topic that could be
used for partisanship and that one side
could point at things folks on the other
side have said that they didn’t like.
Senator CRUZ and I talked about that,
but what we realized is that this is just
too important an issue to get bogged
down in partisan politics, that the
clear and present danger felt by mem-
bers of the Jewish community and the
escalating rhetoric against Jews in
many parts of the country and around
the world are things that call for a bi-
partisan response, a clear condemna-
tion, and also a Senate commitment
that, as a Senate, we will do all we can
to combat anti-Semitism so that we
can be true to the equality principle
that is our Nation’s North Star, so that

we can be true to the freedom of reli-
gious worship that is enshrined in the
First Amendment. It is in the First
Amendment for a very important rea-
son.
I applaud my colleague, and I hope it
is the pleasure of this body to accept
the motion he will soon make by unan-
imous consent that we pass this strong
statement of where the Senate is on
this most important topic.
With that, I yield the floor back to
my colleague from Texas.
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I thank my
friend from Virginia for his powerful
and eloquent remarks decrying anti-
Semitism and implore all of us to stand
united with one clear bipartisan voice,
Democrats and Republicans all on the
same page, 100 to 0, saying that anti-
Semitism has no place in the United
States of America.
With that, I ask unanimous consent
that the Judiciary Committee be dis-
charged from further consideration and
the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 189.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the resolution by
title.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read as follows:
A resolution (S. Res. 189) condemning all
forms of antisemitism.
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate
proceeded to consider the resolution.
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the resolution be
agreed to, the preamble be agreed to,
and the motions to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
The resolution (S. Res. 189) was
agreed to.
The preamble was agreed to.
(The resolution, with its preamble, is
printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’)
Mr. CRUZ. Thank you.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
f
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—
S. 1562
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the Rules
Committee be discharged from further
consideration of S. 1562 and the Senate
proceed to its immediate consider-
ation; that the Warner substitute at
the desk be agreed to; that the bill, as
amended, be considered read a third
time and passed; and that the motion
to reconsider be considered made and
laid upon the table with no intervening
action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Tennessee.
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I
am reserving the right to object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am
deeply disappointed that the majority
has rejected this request before I can
even lay out why I think it is needed.
My request was to take up and pass the
filed S. 1562, as amended.
This legislation is pretty simple,
even for this body. It would require
that any Presidential campaign that
receives offers of assistance from an
agent of a foreign government have an
obligation to report that offer of assist-
ance to law enforcement—specifically
the FBI.
Remember, our laws already prohibit
campaign assistance from foreign gov-
ernments. Let’s take a moment and see
how we got here. I am going to lay out
a little bit of history, and then I am
going to ask the minority leader to
make a couple of comments, and then I
will come back and finish my state-
ment. Before I turn it over to the mi-
nority leader, let me refresh my col-
leagues on the other side and others as
to how we got here.
In 2016, Russia and its agents inter-
vened in our Presidential election—
breaking into personal files, attempt-
ing to hack into our voting system,
and using Facebook and Twitter to cre-
ate fake accounts to splinter our coun-
try.
During the campaign, then-Candidate
Trump publicly called on Russia—that
if they had any damaging information
on then-Candidate Clinton, they should
release it. Remarkably, that very same
day was the first day Russia started to
dribble out its damaging information.
The unanimous consensus of the en-
tire American intelligence community,
the Mueller investigation, and the bi-
partisan Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee, of which I am proud to be vice
chairman—all have stated that Russia
massively intervened in our elections,
and they did so in an attempt to help
then-Candidate Trump and hurt Can-
didate Clinton.
President Trump’s own FBI Director
and his Director of National Intel-
ligence have said that Russia or others
will likely be back in 2020 because their
tactics in 2016 were both cheap and ef-
fective. We are now 17 months before
the 2020 election. I personally believe
we are not prepared.
This body needs to take up bipartisan
election security legislation to ensure
there is a paper ballot trail after all
the voting in America so Americans
can have trust that the integrity of
their votes will be counted. We need to
work together—I know there are many
working on this issue—to put some
guardrails on our social media plat-
forms like Facebook, Twitter, and
Google so they are not as easily manip-
ulated by foreign agents to create fake
accounts.
Unfortunately, this White House and
this President still don’t seem to ap-
preciate the seriousness of the threat.
Mr. Trump continues to undermine the
Mueller report. As a matter of fact, it
has been reported that he won’t even
convene a Cabinet meeting on election
security. His Homeland Security Sec-
retary was told not to have that meet-
ing because it might offend the Presi-
dent. Against the advice of his own FBI
Director, who said just in the last 2
weeks—he said yesterday—even in a
world where we have gotten used to
outrageous statements coming from
the White House, he said yesterday
that he might not report and he would
maybe even welcome Russia or China
or other bad actors if they again of-
fered him assistance in the next cam-
paign.
I yield the floor.
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I
thank my friend from Virginia for of-
fering this unanimous consent request.
I express my severe, severe disappoint-
ment in our friends on the Republican
side blocking it.
The bottom line is very simple. When
a President feels it is more important
to win an election than conduct a fair
election, we are a step further away
from democracy and towards autoc-
racy. That is what dictators believe—
winning at all costs. That seems to be
what President Trump said yesterday.
The shame of this is that our Repub-
lican colleagues can’t even bring them-
selves to say that when a foreign na-
tion tries to interfere in our election,
it ought to be reported to the FBI. How
minimal. How minimal.
How disgraceful it is that our Repub-
lican friends cower before this Presi-
dent when they know that the things
he does severely damage democracy.
This one is a new low. It is OK for for-
eign powers to interfere, and we don’t
have to report it to law enforcement?
That is welcoming foreign powers to
interfere, and, as my friend from Vir-
ginia said, the President’s own FBI Di-
rector said it is going to get worse in
2020. But our Republican friends say:
Let’s cover it up because it might have
an effect that we like.
Today is a new low for this Senate,
for this Republican Party here in the
Senate, and for this democracy.
I would urge my friends, when they
go home over the weekend—my friends
on the other side of the aisle—to
rethink this. We will offer this unani-
mous consent request again. To say
that it is OK to interfere, that we
shouldn’t have any law enforcement,
that we should have no knowledge, is
to encourage Russia, China, North
Korea, and Iran to interfere in our elec-
tions with no recourse. Shame. Shame.
It is truly outrageous that this unan-
imous consent request, which should
bring all of us together, is being
blocked by our Republican friends.
I thank my colleague for his wise,
wise unanimous consent request.
I yield the floor.
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank
my friend, the Senator from New York,
the minority leader, and I agree with
him.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3623
June 13, 2019
This is really unfortunate timing. I
can’t imagine—I always thought that
in today’s political environment, you
always think yesterday’s could be the
greatest outrage, but the fact that yes-
terday, the President of the United
States said—after all that we have
gone through in the last 21⁄2 years, after
all of the evidence of Russian interven-
tion has been out and vetted, after 140
contacts between Russian officials and
folks affiliated with the Trump cam-
paign or Trump business operations,
you would think there would be a sense
of some level of moral obligation, even
if we are not backward-looking, to say
that on a going-forward basis, we ought
to make clear that if any foreign power
tries to intervene again in an election,
the least we can do is ask for a require-
ment to report it to law enforcement.
(Mr. CRAMER assumed the Chair.)
I heard yesterday the President went
on and kind of said: Oh, it is no big
thing; everybody does it.
No, Mr. President, everybody doesn’t
do it.
The Presiding Officer who just left
the chair—I have no question in my
mind that if a foreign power tried to
intervene in his campaign, he would re-
port it to law enforcement. All evi-
dence in the past of attempted foreign
intervention—candidates stepped up—
it didn’t matter which party—and did
the right thing and reported it to law
enforcement.
One of my colleagues on the other
side said that they don’t want to reliti-
gate 2016. There will be other times and
places to further litigate whatever hap-
pened in 2016. In terms of today, I don’t
want to, either. I just want to make
sure that we are safe from foreign
intervention in 2020. What is remark-
able is that we now live in a world
post-9/11 that dramatically changed
things for a whole host of us. We have
a whole series of new—appropriately
so—security at our airports. The
mantra at our airports that TSA and
Homeland Security always try to pro-
mote is ‘‘If you see something, say
something.’’ It is not an undue burden,
I think, on the traveling public, and be-
cause of that involvement, I think the
airports are safer. Shouldn’t we have
the same de minimis standard to pro-
tect the integrity of our election sys-
tem? If you see something, say some-
thing.
All my legislation is requiring is
this: If there is indication that agents
of foreign governments are trying to
intervene in our elections, tell law en-
forcement. Tell the FBI.
I tried to draft my legislation in
ways to make sure it wouldn’t involve
any of our activities in an official
sense. It wouldn’t involve dealings at
Embassy parties, and it wouldn’t in-
volve contacts in the normal course.
I would say to my friends on the
other side, if there are ways to improve
this legislation to make sure we can
reach agreement on what I have to be-
lieve is common agreement here—that
we don’t want foreign governments in-
tervening in our Presidential elec-
tions—I am wide open as to how we can
change this to make it better. But to
say, in the face of this President’s own
FBI Director, who has said it would be
important that the FBI have this infor-
mation about foreign intervention, and
then to have the man sitting in the
White House saying that his own FBI
Director is wrong—I would ask my col-
leagues, do you agree with Christopher
Wray, the FBI Director, about the im-
portance of law enforcement seeing the
evidence of foreign intervention, or do
you believe it is not a big thing? Now
I am anxious to hear a response from
my colleagues.
I know there may be questions such
as, what about the Steele dossier? That
was somewhat of a foreign interven-
tion, MARK. What about the Steele dos-
sier?
Well, that was reported to the FBI. It
was given to the FBI in the summer of
2016.
If there are ways we can make sure
on a going-forward basis that any of
those foreign-based activities are ap-
propriately reported to law enforce-
ment, let’s have at it. But to say that
we don’t think this is important
enough or that somehow this issue of
the integrity of our election system
shouldn’t be debated or shouldn’t be
taken up to put protections in place is
frankly astonishing.
It is astonishing to me as well that 17
months out from the next election, we
have a White House where there is no
one in charge of election security. We
are 17 months out from the next elec-
tion, and we have let sit fallow bipar-
tisan election security legislation that
would ensure that there is that paper
trail and there is that ability to audit
the actions after the fact so we can
make sure Americans have faith in the
integrity of the election system.
It is pretty remarkable that we are 17
months out from the next election and
3 weeks after we saw manipulation of a
video of the Speaker of the House—
that clearly was manipulated—that
spread a false impression around the
country and around the world, and we
don’t have common agreement on some
basic rules of the road so that social
media is not manipulated again in 2020
the way it was in 2016. We only need to
look at how social media manipulation
leads to hate and bloodshed in India
and Burma and countries around the
world.
Not taking action on these items is
the height of irresponsibility. This
most basic of all requirements simply
says: If you see something, say some-
thing. If there is foreign intervention,
tell the FBI. Let them make the judg-
ment.
Why would anyone say that is not
necessary when we have seen the re-
cent history in our country, and for
that matter, we have seen the same
tactics Russia has used in America
used in the Brexit vote and in the
French Presidential elections? Again, I
go back to Director of National Intel-
ligence Coats, who said they will be
back, and FBI Director Wray, who said
they will be back, and they need this
information.
I hope that maybe after the weekend,
my colleagues on the other side will re-
consider and take up this issue.
I will close with this: I just can’t
imagine—and I know some of my col-
leagues on the other side have already
started to speak out, and I appreciate
that. I appreciate their speaking out at
a time when there is huge fear of the
White House and this President’s will-
ingness to take vendettas out against
anyone who raises a voice in opposi-
tion.
Think for a moment. Think for just a
moment about what Donald Trump
said yesterday from the Oval Office. A
President’s words from the Oval Office
still carry weight. The President of the
United States said: Well, everybody
does this. So he would take a look at
assistance that might come from Rus-
sia or China or some other adversary
nation. My goodness gracious. The
modern father of the Republican Party,
Ronald Reagan, must be spinning in his
grave.
Again, Mr. President, I am not here
to relitigate 2016. I am here to make
sure that we do our job, that we honor
that oath to protect and defend the
Constitution against all enemies, for-
eign and domestic. I don’t know about
you, but I would call the actions of
Russia over the last few years the ac-
tions of a foreign enemy.
We also have an obligation to make
sure we protect the integrity of our
election system. So let’s take off the
Republican and Democratic hats for a
few minutes, and let’s go ahead and
pass election security legislation. Let’s
go ahead and put some basic guardrails
around social media so we are not ma-
nipulated in future elections. Let’s
make sure we go ahead and put an obli-
gation on all Presidential campaigns
going forward that if they see evidence
of foreign intervention, they report it
appropriately to the FBI and law en-
forcement.
With that, Mr. President, I yield the
floor, and I hope to reserve the right, if
my colleague from Tennessee is going
to respond to my comments, to have a
chance to respond to her comments as
well.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee.
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I
would like to articulate the reason for
the objection to the legislation from
the Senator from Virginia.
Let me begin by saying that we are
all for free and fair and honest elec-
tions. I know the Senator from Vir-
ginia spent some time as Governor of
Virginia. He knows that in 2016, no bal-
lots—no ballots—no one’s vote was en-
cumbered or affected. He knows that I
have served on an election commission,
and I know that the Senator from Vir-
ginia appreciates that our county elec-
tion commissions and our State elec-
tion commissions are in charge of se-
curing those elections.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3624 June 13, 2019
I have to state to the Presiding Offi-
cer that I know that in the great State
of Tennessee, our county election com-
missions and our State election com-
mission and our secretary of state are
very focused on making certain that
these elections are fair and honest
elections. They are going to do that for
all elections—local, State, and, of
course, in the 2020 Presidential elec-
tion.
I think a little bit of context is al-
ways helpful. First of all, let me say
this: I welcome my colleagues across
the aisle to the understanding that bad
actors have tried for decades—dec-
ades—to influence what is going on in
our government and in our country.
Indeed, I remember, as a child in 4–H
Club—and I think that probably the
Presiding Officer was a member of 4–H
Club growing up—to me, as a young
girl in South Mississippi, the 4–H Club
was a wonderful experience. It opened a
lot of doors to me. I recall sitting in a
4–H Club meeting at one point, and I
heard about communism. I heard about
what the Russians and the Communists
wanted to do to our freedoms here in
this country, and I can recall how
frightened I felt when I heard that.
So to my colleagues across the aisle
who in 2016 realized that these bad ac-
tors—Russia, China, Iran, North Korea;
people I call the new axis of evil—did
not wish us well, I am so pleased to
know that they have come to this real-
ization that they indeed do not wish us
well. My hope is that, in a bipartisan
way, we can move forward and make
certain we do not allow these bad ac-
tors to in any way impede our freedoms
or infringe on our government.
Now, specific to the UC that was pre-
sented to us, this would require a Pres-
idential campaign and all employees to
report their contacts with foreign na-
tionals in which they discuss a con-
tribution, donation, or expenditure,
such as an ad, or coordination, collabo-
ration, providing information, pro-
viding services, or persistent and re-
peated contact with a government or a
foreign country or a foreign agent
thereof.
This is what it all means. These re-
porting requirements are overbroad.
Presidential campaigns would have to
worry about disclosure at a variety of
levels, so many different levels. Con-
sider vendors who work for a campaign,
people who are supplying some kind of
good or service to a campaign. It would
include those vendors, including all the
service contracts. It would apply to
door-knockers, it would apply to
phone-bankers—down to any person
who shares their views with a can-
didate.
I want to make sure that everybody
hears that. Any person who shares
their views with a candidate would be
reportable. Think about that. Think
about what that would cause. With this
law, it would be prudent for every cam-
paign contact to start with these
words: Before you tell me anything, are
you a foreign national?
We have the Foreign Agent Registra-
tion Act. Campaign finance law makes
it illegal to take contributions or co-
ordinate expenditures with foreign na-
tionals without a green card. We have
public official ethics laws.
Campaigns could have to report so-
cial media responses or interactions,
report every non-U.S. citizen, or even
every Dreamer. We hear a lot about the
Dreamers. So think about this. You
would report every non-U.S. citizen or
Dreamer who volunteers for your cam-
paign or knocks on doors or even
knocks on the door of a foreign na-
tional.
Every vendor contact, every call cen-
ter, every contract, every discussion—
all of this, all of it, would begin with
‘‘Are you a foreign national?’’
So that is the overbroad nature of
this. The goal is to make sure we never
ever have a foreign government inter-
fering, and we share that goal. It was
wrong in 2016. It was wrong in 2018. It
would be wrong in 2020. That is why we
need to make certain we do not have
this kind of interference. No one wants
foreign interference of any type in our
government in any way, shape, or
form.
To the Senator across the aisle, we
didn’t like it when we heard former
President Obama say to David Medved:
Tell Vladimir, I will have more flexi-
bility after the election. We didn’t ap-
preciate that.
We didn’t appreciate all that was
transpiring back in 2015 with the Clin-
ton Foundation and Uranium One. We
had questions about that.
Do we want to make certain things
such as that do not occur? Of course,
but the UC that was presented is
overbroad, and this is something that
should be done in a thoughtful way. It
should be done in a bipartisan way.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia.
Mr. WARNER. I see the Senator from
the Finance Committee is here. I will
not take but a couple of moments.
I appreciate the comments of the
Senator from Tennessee. She agrees we
ought to make sure there is not foreign
intervention in our elections. That
ought to be a fairly easy thing to agree
to.
I want to point out that her reading
of my legislation is not accurate. The
only thing that would have to be re-
ported is if an agent of a foreign gov-
ernment or foreign national offered
something that was already prohibited,
not a foreign national wanting to vol-
unteer on a campaign. We already laid
out prohibited activities that violate
the law. The only action reported
would be those actions that are prohib-
ited.
Again, I will take my colleague at
her word. If there are ways to improve
on this legislation, I am wide open for
business.
I think in past elections, she is right.
She ran for Governor. My friend from
Iowa has run for a lot of elections. I
think most of us in this Chamber
would never think about taking help
from a foreign government. If there are
ways to work better, I welcome it.
We are only here having this discus-
sion and debate because, in a lot of
ways, the rules of the game changed in
2016. A foreign power, Russia, caught
our government, our political system,
and our companies totally off guard.
They hacked into the Democratic Na-
tional Committee’s individuals’ per-
sonal accounts.
I would remind the Presiding Officer
of the very day then-Candidate Trump
said on national television during the
campaign: If the Russians have dirt on
Hillary, bring it on. It was the very
first day the intelligence community,
the Mueller report, and our bipartisan
Senate Intelligence Committee found
out that the Russians actually took
him at his word and started releasing
information to him that day.
I think the integrity of our election
system is terribly important. Russians
tried to penetrate 50 States and got
into 21 of them. I think they could
have changed totals if they wanted to.
They chose not to that year.
We have done better in 2018, but I
think we can even do more and, again,
only for States that want to take addi-
tional Federal assistance. That has
been the working arrangement with
our colleagues from the other side. I
know very few folks who wouldn’t say
that with the ability to have systems
hacked into—that are as much dif-
ferent today than it was 20 years ago—
having that paper trail after the fact
makes a lot of sense. Let’s agree to
work on that.
We have this whole new beast of so-
cial media companies out there that
provide a lot of good, but we have seen
in repeated ways that they can be ma-
nipulated. What we saw in 2016 is going
to pale in comparison with the advent
of deepfake and other serious incidents.
We got caught off guard. We should not
be caught off guard in 2020.
I filed this legislation a month ago
because I thought we needed to be ab-
solutely clear going forward. The rea-
son for the immediacy of this legisla-
tion proposed, and why it is so nec-
essary, is because the President of the
United States, yesterday, from the
Oval Office, said that everybody in pol-
itics takes input from foreign govern-
ments. He left everybody with that im-
pression. I don’t. I absolutely believe
the Senator from Iowa doesn’t. He said,
even after all that has happened in the
last 21⁄2 years, that if Russia or China
or other countries intervene again, he
might take that information, take that
assistance again.
Our country is better than that. Our
democracy is more important than a
willingness to be traded away for the
short-term political gain of being in
cahoots with a foreign power. I am not
saying that has happened, but, boy oh
boy, what an invitation we made yes-
terday to folks, as the Senator from
Tennessee just indicated, who don’t
wish us well.

June 13, 2019
If there are ways to improve on this
legislation, I am wide open for that,
but if we don’t put in place an obliga-
tion that is up-to-date and a moral ob-
ligation that I think we have all hon-
ored, if we don’t put in place a legal ob-
ligation to make sure that if you see
evidence of foreign intervention, you
report it, then shame on us.
I will close with this. We do it at the
airport—you see something, say some-
thing. Shouldn’t we have at least those
same standards, in terms of protection
of our critical democracy, going for-
ward?
I yield the floor.
f
ELDER ABUSE AWARENESS DAY
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I call
my colleagues’ attention to an issue
that has affected many families in
Iowa and throughout the country. That
issue is elder abuse and neglect of
those same people.
Many older Americans reside in as-
sisted care facilities, nursing homes,
and all kinds of group living arrange-
ments. It is critical that these care fa-
cilities and the staff at the facilities
not only follow the law but provide the
type of care they would want their own
family members to receive.
The Des Moines Register last year
published reports suggesting a trou-
bling lack of compassionate care for el-
derly residents in some of the nursing
homes in my State. We also had other
reports surfacing in 2017 of nursing
home workers in at least 18 different
facilities taking humiliating and unau-
thorized photos of elderly residents and
posting them on social media websites.
Earlier this year, I convened an over-
sight hearing in which we heard from
the daughters of two elderly women
who resided in a federally funded nurs-
ing home. One testified that her moth-
er, an Iowan, died due to neglect in a
facility that held the highest possible
rating—a five-star rating—on a Federal
Government website. The family dis-
covered that the nursing home was the
subject of multiple complaint inves-
tigations related to those complaints
in recent years. Yet, after each com-
plaint, government inspectors reported
the facility had come back ‘‘into sub-
stantial compliance with program re-
quirements.’’
At this same hearing, another wit-
ness from another State testified about
her mother’s rape in a nursing home.
These and similar cases around the
country point to the need for reform.
By one estimate, 1 in 10 persons older
than the age of 60 will fall victim to
elder abuse each year.
According to the inspector general at
the Department of Health and Human
Services, one-third of nursing home
residents may experience harm while
under the care of these facilities. In
more than half of these cases, the harm
was preventable. That is why statutes
like the Elder Abuse Prevention and
Prosecution Act, which I championed
in the last Congress; also the Older
Americans Act, which promotes sen-
iors’ independence; and the Elder Jus-
tice Act, which I have long supported,
are all very important pieces of legisla-
tion.
On Monday, I introduced a resolution
designating June 15 as World Elder
Abuse Awareness Day. I would like to
thank my lead cosponsor, Senator
BLUMENTHAL of Connecticut, for join-
ing me in introducing this legislation.
The ranking member of the Senate Fi-
nance Committee, as well as the lead-
ers of Senate Aging Committee, Sen-
ators COLLINS and CASEY, along with
Senators LANKFORD and HASSAN, also
are original cosponsors. I thank all of
them for doing that.
This bipartisan resolution recognizes
those adult protective services and
healthcare personnel, ombudsmen,
criminal justice personnel, and advo-
cates who help prevent and combat
elder abuse in communities all around
our country.
It calls for us to promote awareness
and long-term prevention of elder
abuse. Congress has a very key role to
play in ensuring the protections of sen-
iors, not only in the passing of legisla-
tion but in our constitutional over-
sight role to make sure the executive
branch of government faithfully exe-
cutes those laws. In faithfully exe-
cuting our laws in spirit as well as in
the legalese, they will be helping us
prevent elder abuse.
Years ago, I joined my colleagues in
developing an earlier version of the
Elder Justice Act. It is time to update
and extend the key programs author-
ized under this important law, which
authorized the Elder Justice Coordi-
nating Council and also authorized re-
sources to support forensic centers to
investigate elder abuse, among other
initiatives in that important legisla-
tion. I am working closely with the
members of the Elder Justice Coalition
on legislation to accomplish that goal.
It is also time for us to update and
extend the Older Americans Act, which
I have long supported.
As Finance Committee chairman, I
intend to convene a hearing to discuss
ways that we can continue to promote
the health and well-being of our sen-
iors, which is an issue I have cared
about for a long time.
Creating a supportive, inclusive envi-
ronment in our communities is essen-
tial to preventing elder abuse, and that
is what the World Elder Abuse Aware-
ness Day is all about.
I urge my colleagues to join me in
raising awareness for the most vulner-
able among us, protecting our loved
ones and protecting people we don’t
know, but in the process of our doing
that, we empower all citizens to take a
stand against elder abuse.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for

objection, it is so ordered.

HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES
LANCE CORPORAL BRENT ZOUCHA
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise
to continue my tribute to Nebraska’s
heroes and the current generation of
men and women who have given their
lives while defending our freedom in
Iraq and Afghanistan. Each of these
Nebraskans has a powerful story to
tell. I will reflect today upon the life of
LCpl Brent Zoucha of the Marine
Corps.
Brent was born in Central City, NE,
but he grew up in nearby Clarks, which
is a small town of about 350 residents.
While growing up, Rita, Brent’s moth-
er, described him as having a great
smile and always goofing around. Brent
was the youngest of four. He had two
older brothers, Dominic and Dyrek,
and an older sister, Sherri.
As the youngest of the bunch, Brent
had to learn to adapt in the household.
This would require him to wake up
early to ensure he would have hot
water when he got ready for the day.
He was also known for acquiring his
brother Dyrek’s clothes as they were
similar in size and only a few years
apart.
Brent loved sports cars—a passion
that pushed him to work at the local
gas and oil shop at the age of 14. Be-
cause he was an easygoing youngster,
Brent got along with all of his siblings
extremely well. He loved sports and fol-
lowed many professional teams, espe-
cially the New York Yankees and the
Green Bay Packers. He had a very
large baseball card collection and a
special interest in the legendary Babe
Ruth.
While living in Clarks, Brent devel-
oped his athletic ability and partici-
pated in basketball and track and field.
His 6-foot-5-inch frame made him a per-
fect fit for both basketball and the
high jump, and he was excellent at
both. Rita, Brent’s mother, fondly re-
members the day that Brent came
home while holding the rim and parts
of the backboard to the basketball
hoop at the school. He told her he had
dunked the basketball so hard that he
had broken the entire hoop. While Rita
was worried about paying for a replace-
ment, all Brent could do was laugh and
smirk at his great athletic achieve-
ment.
Like many small town Nebraskan
boys, Brent also spent much of his time
hunting and fishing. He also had a
strong bond with his animals and even
trained one of his chickens to fly onto
his shoulder on command. During high
school, when Brent wasn’t working at
Pollard Propane & Oil, he could be
found hanging out with his friends on
the weekend or with Meghan Ham-
mond, his long-time girlfriend.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3626 June 13, 2019
While in high school, his older broth-
er Dyrek enlisted in the U.S. Marine
Corps, and Brent was inspired by his
service to serve our country. Shortly
after graduating from High Plains
Community High School in May of
2005, Brent enlisted in the U.S. Marine
Corps. The extreme discipline that his
brother and other marines routinely
displayed greatly interested him. He
graduated from the Marine Corps
Depot at San Diego in September of
2005.
He was assigned to the 1st Battalion,
7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Divi-
sion, I Marine Expeditionary Force in
Twentynine Palms, CA, which was the
Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Cen-
ter. Coincidentally, he was assigned to
the exact unit his older brother Cpl
Dyrek Zoucha was in. Shortly after ar-
riving at Twentynine Palms, he and his
brother found out they would both soon
be deployed to Al Anbar Province in
Iraq.
This particular area of Iraq saw the
majority of its fighting and counterin-
surgency from 2004 until 2007. So Brent
arrived in the heat of battle. Initially,
fighting between insurgents and the
marines in this area involved heavy
urban warfare. However, the strategy
evolved to focus on ambushing soldiers
and Iraqi security forces.
While he was on deployment, Rita
would send Brent care packages and
talk on the phone with him when she
could. She remembers talking on the
phone with him in early June and send-
ing him a care package of fig cookies
and the game of Monopoly for a re-
minder of his hometown comfort, but
this was the last conversation they
would have and the last care package
Rita would send to Brent. While con-
ducting a combat mission on June 9,
2006, Brent and four other marines
came across an IED. Tragically, Brent
and the four other marines lost their
lives due to the wounds they sustained.
The entire Central Nebraska commu-
nity was in complete shock upon learn-
ing of Brent’s death. Services were held
on June 21, 2006, at St. Peter’s Catholic
Church in Clarks, and the funeral took
place at the Calvary Cemetery. Amer-
ican flags and Patriot Guard Riders
lined the streets from the church to
the cemetery. Rita later received con-
dolence letters from all over the United
States, including from President
George W. Bush, then-Senator Hagel,
Governor Schwarzenegger, and numer-
ous fellow soldiers and marines. Rita
continues to honor those who have
served by working at the local VFW.
If you visit Clarks today, you will see
Brent Zoucha Memorial Lane, which
has been dedicated in his honor. Rita
will always cherish Brent as the ideal
son who loved his life and everyone
around him. I am honored to tell his
story.
I yield the floor.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF
CONGRESSMAN DONALD FRASER
HON. NANCY PELOSI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise with
my colleague Congresswoman BETTY MCCOL-
LUM to honor the life of a dedicated public
servant, Congressman Donald Fraser. A life-
long Minnesotan, Congressman Fraser de-
voted his life to fighting for the people of Min-
neapolis and all Americans. Whether serving
in the Navy during WWII, in the Minnesota
State Senate, in the U.S. Congress or as the
longest-serving mayor in Minneapolis’s history,
Congressman Fraser was a patriot who never
wavered in his commitment to lifting up hard-
working families and building a brighter future
for our children and grandchildren.
Congressman Fraser was a true champion
for good. Together with his beloved wife of 68
years, Arvonne, a deeply respected women’s
rights advocate, he fiercely promoted human
rights and championed progressive values. In
the U.S. House of Representatives, Congress-
man Fraser earned the respect of all his col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle as a skilled
and thoughtful legislator. He was a man of
quiet dignity, who allowed the power of his
ideas build coalitions for progress.
He believed deeply in the importance of en-
suring that our nation’s foreign policy upheld
our bedrock principles of liberty, justice and
human rights. Congressman Fraser lived his
values through action, introducing legislation
to ensure that American humanitarian aid
never enriched tyrants or enabled oppression
and persecution. He was persistent in his work
to deepen America’s commitment to democ-
racy, not only abroad but at home: introducing
the Home Rule Act of 1973 to allow the citi-
zens of our nation’s capital the right to self-
governance and have their voices heard.
Congressman Fraser was also a dedicated
conservationist who helped protect many of
Minnesota’s and America’s most beautiful nat-
ural places. As the father of the Boundary
Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act, he helped
guarantee that this beautiful landscape would
be preserved and enjoyed by generations of
Americans for years to come.
We all saw how much joy Congressman
Fraser took in being mayor of Minneapolis.
During his 14 years in office, he brought trans-
formational change to the city he called home.
He prided himself on his ability to listen to the
needs of his constituents and never assumed
to know the answers, but worked to bring peo-
ple together to address the most pressing
problems facing their community. He distin-
guished himself as a champion of early child-
hood education, recognizing that a free, qual-
ity public education was the key to success for
America’s young people and the most effec-
tive tool for fulfilling our founding promise of
equality and opportunity for all.
Congressman Fraser has left an enduring
legacy of progress for the people of Min-
neapolis, communities throughout Minnesota
and for all Americans. May it be a comfort to
Thomas, Mary, John, Jean and the entire Fra-
ser family that Don is now reunited with the
love of his life, Arvonne, and with his beloved
Anne and Lois. May it be a comfort that so
many people across the country mourn with
and pray for them at this sad time.

CELEBRATING THE 30TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF CR FLETCHER ASSOCI-
ATES
HON. JOHN KATKO
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in
celebration of CR Fletcher Associates, Inc.
This year marks the organization’s 30th anni-
versary providing employment placement serv-
ices throughout the greater Central New York
area. CR Fletcher Associates has assisted job
seekers and employers alike throughout its
history.
CR Fletcher Associates was started in 1989
by Carol Fletcher. A graduate of LeMoyne
College, Ms. Fletcher spent nine years gaining
expertise in the recruiting industry before
using her knowledge to begin her own recruit-
ment and professional placement business.
Her business has rapidly grown since opening
its doors and has become a family operation
with her husband Tom Fletcher joining in
2000. Thousands of job openings have been
filled with the help of CR Fletcher Associates
under the esteemed leadership of Ms. Fletch-
er, and she is a symbolic role model for those
aspiring to become business leaders.
The services provided by CR Fletcher
strengthen the Central New York economy by
helping businesses meet labor needs. In addi-
tion, CR Fletcher supports individuals eager to
pursue meaningful careers and opportunities.
The firm’s efforts have yielded several awards
and recognitions, including CNY Business
Journal’s Fast Track 50 Award and Greater
Syracuse Chamber of Commerce’s Business
of the Year Award.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the
House to join me in celebrating the 30th anni-
versary of CR Fletcher Associates. Busi-
nesses and individuals truly benefit from the
presence of CR Fletcher Associates in our
community. I am confident CR Fletcher Asso-
ciates will provide further benefit to our com-
munity for many more years to come.

CARBON CAPTURE PRIZE ACT
HON. GRACE MENG
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, we stand at a
critical juncture where the decisions we make
today about combating climate change will
have lasting consequences for generations to
come. Each year, millions of metric tons of
carbon dioxide (CO2) are emitted into the at-
mosphere. These emissions are causing the
planet to warm and creating more sudden, se-
vere weather-related storms. On top of that,
significant amounts of CO2 already reside in
the atmosphere. While it is critical that all na-
tions transition to a low-carbon future, we
must also explore technologies that remove
and sequester carbon pollution to keep global
average temperatures from rising above 1.5
degrees.
That is why, today, I am introducing the
Carbon Capture Prize Act, which would direct
the Department of Energy (DOE) to create a
prize competition to incentivize research, de-
velopment, and commercialization of direct air
capture technology to remove and perma-
nently sequester CO2 from the atmosphere.
Technologies, like direct air capture, can
provide nations the tools needed to reduce
carbon pollution in the atmosphere. The ben-
efit of this technology is that it can be located
anywhere, making its potential scale of de-
ployment enormous. A major challenge facing
direct air capture technology, however, is cost,
which can range between $800 and $250 per
metric ton of CO2 removal from the atmos-
phere.
My legislation would address this issue by
establishing a prize competition for direct air
capture technology that reduces CO2 in the at-
mosphere. This bill authorizes an aggregate
prize amount of $30,000,000, and DOE may
run the competition individually or with other
agencies. Prize competitions have long been
an effective tool to find cost-effective solutions
for expensive problems.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
support the Carbon Capture Prize Act. It is un-

This is the 41st Annual Valor Awards spon-
sored by the Northern Virginia Chamber of
Commerce. This event honors the remarkable
heroism and bravery in the line of duty exem-
plified by our public safety officers. Our public
safety and law enforcement personnel put

IN RECOGNITION OF LYNN AAS
HON. KELLY ARMSTRONG
OF NORTH DAKOTA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor a constituent, a veteran, and a
dedicated public servant, Lynn Aas. Lynn’s
courage in battle, contributions to his commu-
nity, and service to his state are testaments to
his incredible character.
Lynn was born near Benedict, North Dakota,
in 1921 and graduated from Velva High
School. While attending the University of North
Dakota, Lynn heard of the attacks on Pearl
Harbor and immediately put his education on
hold to enlist in the U.S. Army. His Army ca-
reer was filled with distinguished service, earn-
ing a Bronze Star, a Purple Heart, the Luxem-
bourg Medal of Honor, and most recently, the
French Legion of Honor Medal for his heroics
during the Battle of the Bulge and Operation
Varsity. Lynn was one of five men who re-
turned from his 55-man unit that survived the
Battle of the Bulge.
Upon completion of his Army service, Lynn
earned a bachelor’s degree in commerce and
a Juris Doctor from the University of North Da-
kota. He worked as a special agent for the
IRS in Minneapolis, where he met Beverly
Stockstad, whom he married in 1952. They
eventually settled in Minot, where he worked
as the business manager of the Medical Arts
Clinic and they raised their four sons.
Lynn’s public service to North Dakota began
by serving in the North Dakota Legislative As-
sembly in the 1967 and 1969 sessions. He
also served as a member of the North Dakota
Constitutional Convention in 1972. Upon re-
tirement, he returned to the legislature, serving
during the 1987 and 1989 sessions, marking
four sessions as a North Dakota legislator.
Lynn has continued to have a profound im-
pact on his community of Minot and the state
of North Dakota. He is a longtime supporter of
Minot State University, playing an instrumental
role in starting their Nursing Program. He
served as president of the Minot Chamber of
Commerce, just celebrated his 59th year of
service in the Kiwanis Club of Minot, and has
been active in his church, and local and state
politics.
June 4th marked Lynn’s 98th birthday. For
this special occasion, I send him warmest
greetings on behalf of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives and blessings to him and his fam-
ily.

RECOGNIZING BARBARA MANNINO
AS THE CONSTITUENT OF THE
MONTH
HON. MIKE LEVIN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, I
am honored to recognize Mrs. Barbara
Mannino, the longtime leader of the Vista
Community Clinic, as my Constituent of the
Month for June. After more than 30 years
serving North County patients at the Vista
Community Clinic and working tirelessly to en-
sure community members received the care
they needed, Barbara retired, and I am deeply
grateful for all of her service.
Under Barbara’s leadership, the Vista Com-
munity Clinic expanded from one location in
an animal shelter to a health center network
with eight locations providing care to 57,000
patients each year, primarily North County
community members who are low-income and
uninsured.
Throughout the country, families are strug-
gling to access affordable health care, pay for
their prescription drugs, and make ends meet,
in part because of this Administration’s efforts
to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. While I
have fought for legislation to lower prescription
drug prices, protect people with pre-existing
conditions, and expand access to affordable
care, it’s the work of people like Barbara that
has helped so many of our neighbors receive
the care they desperately need.
I launched a Constituent of the Month pro-
gram to recognize outstanding individuals in
the 49th District who have gone above and
beyond to give back to our community, sup-
port our neighbors, and make our country
stronger. After more than 30 years providing
critical health care services to local families
most in need, we owe Barbara a debt of grati-
tude, and I am proud to call her the Con-
stituent of the Month.

TRIBUTE TO JOHN J. BAKER
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize one of the unsung heroes of pub-
lic service in Oregon. Mr. John J. Baker has
ably served the people of Oregon and the Or-
egon Department of Transportation for over
thirty years. A transportation economist with a
deep background in the Federal-aid Highway
Program and its formulas, Mr. Baker’s work
has benefitted major transportation projects
and communities across the entire state of Or-
egon.
Mr. Baker’s creative work with federal fund-
ing formulas helped support many legislative
decisions that resulted in millions in additional
federal funding for Oregon. Similarly, his inti-
mate knowledge of federal transportation
grants and the federal grant making process
has helped bring untold millions in grant fund-
ing to the state and to local governments in
Oregon.
I relied on his expertise on a number of oc-
casions to ensure that Oregon, with more than

half of its land owned by the federal govern-
ment, receives a fair share of the Federal
Lands Access Program (known as FLAP) so
we can continue to enjoy access to our amaz-
ing natural wonders. In 2012, the Obama Ad-
ministration proposed replacing the existing
Forest Highways Program with the new FLAP.
My office turned to Mr. Baker to provide the
analysis needed to ensure that the new pro-
gram worked as intended, to ensure that Or-
egon and western states with huge tracts of
federal lands would not be disadvantaged, and
helped me safeguard program funding for
States with the greatest needs.
This summer, Oregon’s first Transportation
Asset Management Plan will be finalized
thanks to Mr. Baker’s steady guiding influence.
With his deep professional connection to fed-
eral transportation policy and funding, it is only
fitting that Mr. Baker be recognized here on
the floor of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives for his remarkable career.
The Oregon Department of Transportation
will suffer an irreplaceable departure this
month when Mr. Baker retires. Madam Speak-
er, I ask my colleagues to join me and all Or-
egonians in thanking John Baker for his long
and dedicated service to the people of Or-
egon. My home state is an immeasurably bet-
ter place because of Mr. Baker’s contributions.
Simply put, Oregon would not be Oregon with-
out people like John Baker.

HONORING OFFICER AUSTIN
GLICKMAN AND LEO WEEKEND
ON THE OCCASION OF THE
THIRD ANNUAL LAW ENFORCE-
MENT OFFICERS WEEKEND AT
LAKE GEORGE
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Officer Austin Glickman
and the Law Enforcement Officers (LEO)
Weekend team for their service to their fellow
officers and their families.
LEO Weekend has been a project of Officer
Glickman since he was a recruit in 2014. The
inspiration for this event came when NYPD
Police Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos
were assassinated in Brooklyn just days be-
fore Officer Glickman’s graduation. He was
moved to organize a retreat for the officers
and families who have sacrificed so much for
the protection of our communities. LEO Week-
end has hosted hundreds of officers from
across the country at Lake George for a
‘‘Weekend Getaway with Their Blood & Blue
Families of Active & Retired Law Enforcement
Officers’’. This amazing organization fully cov-
ers the cost of the retreat for the families who
have been affected by a line of duty death or
serious injury.
Officer Glickman has created a positive en-
vironment to help officers and their families
cope with the physical and emotional injuries
that too often accompany a career in law en-
forcement. We depend on the selfless service
of these officers to conduct our daily lives and
this weekend away is a much-deserved res-
pite. On behalf of New York’s 21st Congres-
sional District, I want to thank Officer Austin
Glickman for his services to the North Country
and to his fellow officers. His message rings
true throughout the country and I look forward
to seeing LEO Weekend continue to thrive
and support those who keep our communities
safe.

RECOGNIZING MR. SUNNY SUNG-IN
KIM
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, it is with
a heavy heart that I rise to announce the
passing of a valued member of our commu-
nity. Sunny Sung-In Kim passed away on
June 9, 2019 surrounded by his loved ones.
Throughout his life he exhibited a constant de-
votion to his family, his Christian faith and the
relationship between the United States of
America and his native Korea.
Born on November 16, 1950 in Pusan,
Korea during the Korean War, Sunny enlisted
in the Republic of Korea Marine Corps as
soon as he was eligible to do so. He served
from 1969 to 1972, achieving the rank of
Lance Corporal. He emigrated to the United
States in 1973 and became a naturalized cit-
izen. On May 11, 1975, he married the love of
his life, Susan Bok-Ja Kim in Long Island,
New York and together raised their two sons.
In 1986, Sunny founded and was President
of Grass Roots, Inc., a food service and cater-
ing business with multiple locations in the Fi-
nancial District of Boston, Massachusetts. In
addition to his success as an entrepreneur,
Sunny had a lifelong passion of service to his
community and served as President of the Ko-
rean American Association of New England
and the Secretary-General of the Federation
of Korean Associations, U.S.A.
As part of his lifelong commitment to hon-
oring the memory of the 36,574 U.S. troops
and the estimated 1.2 million Republic of
Korea troops and civilians who lost their lives
during the Korean War, Sunny galvanized
support for the creation of the Massachusetts
Korean War Veterans Memorial at the
Charlestown Naval Shipyard.
In recognition of his contributions to the
U.S.-Korea alliance and the Korean American
community, Sunny was the recipient of a Pres-
idential Commendation by the President of the
Republic of Korea. As co-Chairman of the
Congressional Caucus on Korea, I will greatly
miss his advocacy on the importance of this
alliance.
Sunny was an active member of the Korean
Presbyterian Church in Greater Boston where
he was an ordained Elder. Sunny’s deep and
abiding faith was the foundation of his family.
He instilled in his sons the virtues of gen-
erosity, graciousness and hearts filled with
gratitude. An avid sports enthusiast, he was a
devoted fan of the Washington Redskins and
the Boston Red Sox.
After nearly three decades of running their
company in New England, Sunny and Susan
retired to Haymarket, Virginia to be near their
sons and grandchildren. I had the great privi-
lege of knowing Sunny during his years of liv-
ing in Northern Virginia and attended church
with him on numerous occasions. I was al-
ways struck by his kindness and his devotion
to his family. In the final years of his life, noth-
ing brought him greater joy than cheering on
his grandchildren while watching them play
football, lacrosse and baseball.
Madam Speaker, Sunny’s example of a life
well-lived shines brightly as a model to us all
and his loss is felt deeply. I ask my colleagues
to join me in celebrating the life of Sunny
Sung-In Kim and in extending our deepest
condolences to his wife Susan, their sons
Thomas and James and their grandchildren
‘‘T’’, Rachel, Samuel, William and Henry.

INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO PER-
MIT THE FLAG OF THE UNITED
STATES TO BE FLOWN AT HALF-
STAFF IN THE EVENT OF THE
DEATH OF A MAYOR OF THE
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce a bill that would make a small but re-
spectful change to federal law by adding the
Mayor of the District of Columbia to the list of
named principals for whom the President can
order the U.S. flag be flown at half-staff. Cur-
rent law states that the President shall make
this order ‘‘upon the death of principal figures
of the United States Government and the Gov-
ernor of a State, territory, or possession, as a
mark of respect to their memory.’’ Surely the
death of a current or former D.C. Mayor
should qualify as a principal. My bill would add
D.C. Mayors, who have the same responsibil-
ities as state and territory governors, to the
current list of officials. This bill is a continu-
ation of our ‘‘Free and Equal D.C.’’ series to
ensure fair recognition of the nearly 700,000
citizens of the District of Columbia.
Congress has already acknowledged that
the District of Columbia is entitled to a place
among the states for certain honors. The re-
quested addition is not as significant as others
Congress has already recognized. For exam-
ple, legislation has ensured that the District of
Columbia War Memorial honors only District
residents who served in World War I, as in-
tended, and that D.C.’s Frederick Douglass
statue sits in the Capitol, alongside statues
from the 50 states. We also successfully
worked with the U.S. Postal Service to create
a D.C. stamp, like the stamps for the 50
states, and worked with the National Park
Service to add the D.C. flag alongside the
state flags near Union Station.
Legislation was also enacted to give D.C. a
coin after it was omitted from legislation cre-
ating coins for the 50 states. Legislation was

needed to require the armed services to dis-

to add the Mayor to the list of principals who

IN RECOGNITION OF THE VA ANN
ARBOR FISHER HOUSE
GROUNDBREAKING CEREMONY
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Fisher House for their ex-
emplary work in service of our nation’s vet-
erans and their families. Today, we celebrate
the groundbreaking of the VA Ann Arbor Fish-
er House which will provide critical temporary
housing for the families of servicemembers.
Fisher House provides free lodging for the
families of active military and veterans while
their loved ones are undergoing treatment.
This program has saved the families of our
servicemen and women an estimated $451
million in costs for lodging and transportation.
With nearly 650,000 veterans, Michigan is the
largest state without a Fisher House. Fisher
House Michigan formed in November 2016,
and as of April 2019 has raised over $5.5 mil-
lion towards its goal of $20 million for con-
struction and support costs of new facilities in
Michigan. The VA Ann Arbor Fisher House will
be the first in the state of Michigan, with plans
to create a second location in Detroit at the
John D. Dingell VA Medical Center already
underway.
The VA Medical Centers in Southeastern
Michigan receive approximately 1000 requests
for lodging from veterans and their families
every month. The creation of a Fisher House
in Michigan will provide significant financial
support for these groups through free lodging
as their family members undergo treatment.
This critical work reaffirms our commitment to
supporting our active military and veterans as
they continue to protect our nation. We thank
Fisher House Michigan for its exemplary work
supporting the families of our servicemembers
and congratulate them on the ground breaking
of the VA Ann Arbor Fisher House.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring Fisher House for their dedi-
cated work. Their efforts to provide high-qual-
ity services to the families of our nation’s vet-
erans and active military are worthy of com-
mendation.

INVENTOR AND PIONEERING EYE
DOCTOR, PATRICIA BATH
HON. KAREN BASS
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, I rise to take
special note of the passing of a long-time con-
stituent, Dr. Patricia E. Bath, an ophthalmol-
ogist whose career included a special focus
on combating preventable blindness in under-
served populations. Among many remarkable
accomplishments, she was the first black fe-
male doctor to patent a medical invention, a
laser device for treating cataracts.
Just two months ago, on April 3, 2019, Dr.
Bath testified before the Senate Judiciary Sub-
committee on Intellectual Property in a hearing
entitled ‘‘Trailblazers and Lost Einsteins:
Women Inventors and the Future of American
Innovation.’’ There she noted gender dispari-
ties that result in fewer women inventors and
made recommendations to improve the bar-
riers she saw as holding back American inno-
vation.
Right out of medical school, she was struck
by discrepancies in vision problems between
the primarily Black patient population she saw
for her internship at Harlem Hospital and the
largely white population she saw at an eye
clinic at Columbia University. Her findings that
blindness was twice as prevalent among Black
people as among white people would drive her
lifelong commitment to bringing quality eye
care to underserved people around the globe.
An educator and researcher, in 1974 she
joined the faculties of the University of Cali-
fornia, Los Angeles, and the nearby Charles
R. Drew University of Medicine and Science.
In 1976 she founded the nonprofit American
Institute for the Prevention of Blindness, to
promote what Dr. Bath called ‘‘community
ophthalmology,’’ which advances optic health
through grass-roots screenings, treatments
and education.
Her research and her work with cataract pa-
tients in the early 1980s led her to envision
the device that became known as the
laserphaco probe, which uses laser tech-
nology to remove the cataracts that cloud the
lens of the eye. The United States Patent and
Trademark Office, which has singled out Dr.
Bath’s achievement several times, said in
2014 that the device had ‘‘helped restore or
improve vision to millions of patients world-
wide.
Dr. Bath’s dedication, insight and brilliance
repeatedly overcame challenges from pre-
vailing attitudes about women and African
Americans in medicine. The recipient of nu-
merous awards and accolades, Dr. Bath de-
scribed her ‘‘personal best moment’’ as using
an implant procedure called keratoprosthesis
to restore the sight of a woman in North Africa
who had been blind for 30 years.
Forty years ago, Dr. Bath wrote in the Jour-
nal of the National Medical Association that
‘‘Disproportionate numbers of blacks are blind-
ed by preventable causes. However, thus far,
no national strategies exist for reducing the
excessive rates of blindness among the black
population.’’ As we honor her memory and her
contributions, her challenge to us remains.

CONGRATULATING PRINCE WIL-
LIAM COUNTY FIRE AND RESCUE
DEPARTMENT CHIEF KEVIN
MCGEE ON HIS RETIREMENT
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize an individual who has made an in-
credible mark on our community. This year
marks the retirement of Chief Kevin McGee
from the Prince William County Fire and Res-
cue Department. This will conclude an almost
40-year career for Chief McGee, all with the
Prince William County Fire and Rescue De-
partment.
Chief McGee joined the Fire and Rescue
Academy in 1979 and rose through the ranks,
becoming Battalion Chief in 1991, Assistant
Chief in 1998 and was appointed Chief of the
Fire and Rescue Department in 2007. Chief
McGee also holds the distinction of having
served at every rank of the Fire Department,
enlisted and officer, on his way to serving as
Chief. His tenure as Chief saw significant ben-
efits for Prince William County including the
reduction of false fire alarms by 82%. Chief
McGee also led a review of Prince William
County’s emergency operations plans in order
to adapt them to better respond to the threat
posed by terrorism. He helped to modernize
the department with the introduction of Geo-
graphic Information Systems, a computer-
aided dispatch system, the Public Safety
Radio Communications System and the E–9–
1–1 and fire and rescue mobile data systems.
All of these improvements helped the Fire and
Rescue Department better serve the residents
of Prince William County.
Chief McGee’s efforts have been recognized
by numerous entities and his leadership has
led to the Department receiving several
awards and citations, including the Governor’s
Award for Outstanding EMS Agency in 2003
and the 2019 Northern Virginia EMS Council’s
EMS Agency Award.
I was first elected to Congress shortly after
Chief McGee was appointed Chief of the Fire
and Rescue Department. I had worked with
him previously during my time as Chairman of
the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors on
various regional boards and commissions. The
partnership that we had built during my time in
local government continued in Congress.
I was fortunate to do several ride-alongs
and facility tours with the Chief and saw first-
hand his dedication to the men and women
who served with him and to the residents of
Prince William County. One case in particular
will always stand out. Chief McGee and I
worked together to get federal benefits re-
stored to a Prince William County first re-
sponder who fell in the line of duty. The Jus-
tice Department had originally denied the
claim, but working with Chief McGee we were
able to get that decision reversed and make
whole in one small way the family members of
that first responder.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in congratulating Chief Kevin McGee on
his almost four decades of service to Prince
William County and to Northern Virginia.
Though he may be retiring, I suspect that he
will continue to remain engaged on the causes
that are close to his heart and he will never be
far from a fire station in Prince William County.
I wish him all the best in retirement.

RECOGNIZING JUNETEENTH
HON. ANTONIO DELGADO
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. DELGADO. Madam Speaker, today I
rise to recognize Juneteenth, the oldest known
celebration commemorating the end of slavery
in the United States.
At its core, Juneteenth is a bittersweet cele-
bration of deferred liberation.
While the Civil War ended at Appomattox on
April 9, 1865, it took more than two months for
word of General Robert E. Lee’s surrender to
reach Texas. When General Gordon Granger,
stationed in Galveston, heard the news on
June 19th, he issued a proclamation that an-
nounced the freedom of 250,000 slaves in the
state. By that time, more than two and a half
years had passed since the Emancipation
Proclamation took effect on January 1, 1863.
Speaking at Gettysburg, President Abraham
Lincoln had prophesized that the Civil War
would bring a new birth of freedom to Amer-
ica. However, for the quarter of a million
slaves in Texas that freedom would come
much later. And for millions of black Ameri-
cans, the end of slavery meant new forms of
oppressive labor practices, racial violence, po-
lice brutality, and the Jim Crow era.
While there have been tremendous strides
for racial equality in the last 70 years including
Brown v. Board of Education, the Civil Rights
Act, affirmative action, and the election of our
first black president, we know that we have a
long way to go. We must continue to uphold
our enduring commitment to equality and
strive for a more just society for people of all
creeds and colors.
On Juneteenth, we remember the untold
millions who suffered the horrors of slavery
and celebrate the liberation of a people. We
do so while keeping our eyes toward tomor-
row, knowing that our best days as a nation
are still ahead of us.

IN HONOR OF U.S. ARMY COLONEL
WILLIAM HENRY SHAW, III
HON. DOUG LAMBORN
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in remembrance of U.S. Army Colonel
William Henry Shaw, III. Colonel Shaw was
born on May 16, 1962, in Vidalia, Ga., the eld-
est son of William Henry Shaw, Jr. and Nancy
Peterson Shaw. Having received a Distin-
guished Military Award while attending North
Georgia College, Colonel Shaw joined the
Army in 1984 as a 2nd lieutenant in the infan-
try and reported to Fort Benning Georgia. As
an Infantry Officer he served in both a Mecha-
nized Infantry Battalion and as the Com-
mander of an Airborne Pathfinder Detachment.
After leaving Ft. Benning he transferred to
Special Forces. Colonel Shaw retired after
serving for 30 years with 25 years in the Spe-
cial Forces.
Some of his assignments included assistant
to the commandant at his alma mater; pro-
fessor of military science at Auburn University
where he earned a master’s degree; missions
to establish refugee camps for our Kurdish al-
lies in the Gulf War; commander of Charlie
Co. Europe based in Stuttgart, Germany; com-
mander of SF forces in Djibouti, Horn of Afri-
ca; Battalion Commander / Deputy Com-
mander of Combined Forces Special Oper-
ations Command (Afghanistan); and the Com-
mander of Afghanistan National Army Special
Operations Advisor Group. His last assign-
ment was in Stuttgart as liaison between U.S.
special operations and our European embas-
sies.
During his distinguished military career,
Colonel Shaw received the Defense Superior
Service Medal, Legion of Merit, two Bronze
Stars, six Meritorious Service Medals, three
Army Commendation Medals, two Joint Serv-
ice Achievement Medals, two Army Achieve-
ment Medals, the Combat Infantry Badge,
Master Parachutist Badge, Military Freefall
Badge, Pathfinder Badge, Air Assault Badge,
Canadian, Israeli, British Airborne Badges,
and Ranger and Special Forces tabs.
Colonel Shaw was a Ranger, Pathfinder,
and Green Beret who loved skydiving. Nothing
was ever more important to Billy than his be-
loved family connections as well as his count-
less friendships. He had the unique ability to
connect with people from all walks of life and
to keep those friendships strong throughout
the years. Billy was a Christian, a Rotarian,
N.G.C. girls’ basketball trainer, an avid hunter
and sportsman, a trustee of the Ligon Founda-
tion, and an avid supporter of many veterans’
organizations. He will be remembered for
making a difference in this world.

IN HONOR OF TEXAS WOMAN’S
UNIVERSITY’S CELEBRATION OF
TEXAS’ CENTENNIAL RATIFICA-
TION OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in honor of the Texas Woman’s Univer-
sity centennial celebration marking Texas’ rati-
fication of the 19th Amendment.
On June 28, 1919, Texas became the ninth
state in the nation to ratify the 19th Amend-
ment, which granted women the constitutional
right to vote. First introduced in the U.S. Con-
gress in 1878, the 19th Amendment prohibits
the restriction of voting rights based on gen-
der. Texas was the first state in the south to
ratify the amendment, which was adopted na-
tionally in 1920.
From its inception, Texas Woman’s Univer-
sity (TWU) has sought to educate women from
Texas and across the country. The university
opened in Denton, Texas in 1902 as an all-
girls school, and was primarily attended by
young women from rural areas seeking voca-
tional training. For more than a century, TWU
has led significant advances in education, pio-
neering multiple academic programs for
women entering the workforce. In 1994, TWU
became fully co-educational, yet continues to
focus on women’s education.
Historically, TWU has been long connected
to the women’s suffrage movement in Texas.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E770 June 13, 2019
Mary Eleanor Brackenridge served as an early
regent for the College of Industrial Arts, now
known as TWU. A pioneer for women’s rights,
Ms. Brackenridge helped form the Texas
Women’s Suffrage Association in 1913 and
served as its president. Additionally, Eliza
‘‘Birdie’’ Johnson and Hellen Stoddard, both
members of the Texas Women’s Suffrage As-
sociation, were instrumental leaders in the
women’s suffrage movement who played sig-
nificant roles in the founding and governing of
TWU.
In honor of this shared history, today TWU
will celebrate the 100th anniversary of Texas’
ratification of the 19th Amendment and the
role TWU played in the women’s suffrage
movement. As we mark this milestone, I am
grateful to the leaders of TWU—past and
present—who have made indelible contribu-
tions to the North Texas community.

IN HONOR OF ABBY DOLLIVER ON
HER RETIREMENT
HON. JOE COURTNEY
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Norwich Superintendent
of Public Schools, Abby Dolliver, on a career
in education spanning 33 years, including 25
in the city of Norwich. Her history of pas-
sionate leadership is rooted in a lifelong dedi-
cation to public service and has positively im-
pacted the lives of countless students, faculty,
and administrators.
Her commitment to Norwich Public Schools
began in 1986 as a social worker. Abby as-
sumed the role of Director of Student Services
and Special Education in 2007 before her ap-
pointment to the position of superintendent in
2010. Her tenure has been marked by an en-
thusiasm for inspiring leadership in others and
utilizing the unique qualities of those she over-
sees. As superintendent, Abby is proud of de-
veloping internal committee structures to en-
courage a greater sense of engagement
among faculty. She regards helping to create
a strong team and surrounding herself with tal-
ented, experienced members of the school
community as her greatest accomplishment.
Though major challenges included tighter
budgets, the closing of three elementary
schools, and the restructuring of the city’s mid-
dle schools, Abby maintained an unwavering
devotion to the needs of her students. In the
midst of that turmoil she actually implemented
innovative, successful magnet programs using
state and federal resources to keep Norwich
public education healthy and high quality.
Abby’s background as both a social worker
and lifelong resident of Norwich has enabled
her to better understand the diverse perspec-
tives of more than 3,500 students who speak
over 25 different languages. Her legendary fa-
ther, Stanley Israelite, instilled in her a devo-
tion to public service that was focused on the
best interests of Norwich’s children. Abby de-
scribes the Norwich school district as ‘‘stu-
dent-driven with kindness as the focus.’’ The
city of Norwich has benefited greatly from this
history of dedication, and I am confident Abby
will find new ways to serve the community for
years to come. I ask my colleagues to please
join me in wishing her a happy retirement.

REINTRODUCING THE SERVICES
FOR ENDING LONG-TERM HOME-
LESSNESS ACT
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to reintroduce the Services for Ending
Long-Term Homelessness Act, legislation that
will help our nation address the long-term
homelessness crisis.
Since the first Federal Strategic Plan to Pre-
vent and End Homelessness was launched in
2010, rates of homelessness among veterans,
families, and chronically homeless individuals
have fallen significantly. Our country has suc-
cessfully taken thousands of individuals and
families off the streets. Unfortunately, last
year, the homeless population in the United
States increased for the second year in a row
since the inception of the Federal Strategic
Plan. According to the annual U.S. Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) Point in Time count, there were about
88,484 chronically homeless individuals and
8,429 people in households with children, for
a total of 96,913 chronically homeless.
Allowing men, women, and children to live
on the streets is not a standard America
should be willing to accept. Unstable housing
impacts the lives of millions of Americans
every year and addressing this problem forth-
rightly, as this bill does, will help get chron-
ically homeless individuals and families off the
streets. I ask that you join me in prioritizing
these efforts to combat long-term homeless-
ness in our country.
Madam Speaker, this important legislation
addresses our country’s homelessness prob-
lem in the following ways:
Requires the Secretary of HHS to design
national strategies for the establishment of
supportive housing services and programs to
assist in ending chronic homelessness and to
implement programs that address chronic
homelessness.
Requires the Secretary of HHS to make
matching grants to eligible entities to provide
services promoting recovery and self-suffi-
ciency and augment the HUD-administered
McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Grants.
Requires the Secretary of HHS to report
performance outcome data on the projects
carried out under the Act.
Madam Speaker, as you know, the most re-
cent data available shows us that more than
a quarter of those currently living without per-
manent shelter are chronically homeless. We
must continue to invest in the needs of these
vulnerable and marginalized members of soci-
ety, which will result in healthier, safer, and
more productive communities.
I urge my colleagues to join me in working
to end homelessness across our nation by
supporting this important piece of legislation.
RECOGNIZING THE 2019 BLACK AND
GOLD SCHOLARSHIP BALL
AWARD RECIPIENTS
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the Joyce-Gillespie-Harrington Edu-
cational and Charitable Foundation and the
Zeta Upsilon Lambda Chapter of the Alpha
Phi Alpha Fraternity on the occasion of their
39th annual Black and Gold Scholarship Ball.
The Joyce-Gillespie-Harrington Educational
and Charitable Foundation was incorporated in
2001 and was formed to provide financial sup-
port to the educational initiatives developed by
the Chapter and Fraternity. It increases oppor-
tunities for achievement for young African-
American men and women through scholar-
ships, mentoring, and charitable services. The
Foundation was named in honor of three com-
munity leaders and fraternity members, James
Burwell Gillespie, Roosevelt Harrington, and
Henry Louis Joyce who were dedicated to the
ideals of ‘‘Scholarship, Community, Service
and Love for all Mankind.’’ Since its inception,
the Foundation has awarded hundreds of
thousands of dollars to local youth to assist
them with continuing their education.
The programs offered by the foundation are
vital to the success of our students. This
year’s Black and Gold Scholarship Ball will
support scholarships for ten college-bound
high school students. During the last nineteen
years, one-hundred students have received
scholarships awarded by the foundation and
have attended some of the top colleges and
universities in the country. With the typical col-
lege graduate’s debt averaging about
$30,000.00, the Foundation’s continued sup-
port of these students is absolutely critical.
I am pleased to include in the RECORD the
following names of the 2019 scholarship win-
ners:
Andrews Boateng—Stone Bridge H.S.;
Jacklyn Bostic-Clarke—Broad Run H.S.;
Ariana Frazier—TC Williams H.S.; Alexander
Harvey—Freedom H.S.; Kevin M. Jackson—
Lake Braddock S.S.; Abigail Jegels—Broad
Run H.S.; Sydney Jenkins—Briar Woods H.S.;
Cameron Miller—Broad Run H.S.; Andrew
Otchere—Rock Ridge H.S.; Derrick L. Pough,
Jr.—Loudoun County H.S.; Jonathan G. Wil-
liams—Tuscarora H.S.
Madam Speaker, these students represent
our country’s next generation of gifted leaders
who will have great impact on our society and
future. I thank the Joyce-Gillespie-Harrington
Charitable and Education Foundation and the
Zeta Upsilon Lambda Chapter of Alpha Phi
Alpha Fraternity for their dedicated commit-
ment to fostering success in our youth and
commend all of the scholarship winners for
their academic excellence. I ask that my col-
leagues join me in congratulating these tal-
ented students and in wishing them great suc-
cess in all their future endeavors.

IN HONOR OF G. ROLAND VELA,
PH.D.
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the contributions of G. Roland
Vela, Ph.D. to the City of Denton and the aca-
demic community. Dr. Vela is a retired pro-
fessor at the University of North Texas, where
he served as one of the first Latino faculty
members. At UNT, he authored 75 scientific
papers and books regarding Texas History.
This history-maker also blazed trails as the
first Hispanic member of the Denton City
Council and one of the country’s first Mexican-
American Microbiologists. In honor of Dr.
Vela’s distinguished achievements, the City of
Denton dedicated the G. Roland Vela Athletic
Complex on May 26, 2019.
Dr. Vela was raised in San Antonio, Texas.
During World War II, he joined the Texas
State Guard at age fifteen and convinced his
parents to sign release papers that would
allow him to enlist in the U.S. Navy at just
seventeen. Though the war concluded before
he was assigned to a ship, the young Texan
dedicated the following year of his life to the
Navy in peacetime.
Following his honorable discharge from the
Navy, Dr. Vela attended San Antonio Junior
College. After transferring to the University of
Texas at Austin, he took multiple jobs to sup-
port himself before graduating with a degree in
bacteriology. In 1951, he received a scholar-
ship for his master’s degree in bacteriology,
which he completed in just one year, followed
by a doctorate in microbiology and bio-
chemistry in 1963.
Dr. Vela later began a 35-year tenure as a
professor at the University of North Texas in
Denton, where he taught undergraduate and
graduate courses in microbiology. He was
chosen to be part of the American Academy of
Microbiology and was named the Associate
Dean of Science and Technology in the Col-
lege of Art and Sciences. During his tenure at
UNT, Dr. Vela oversaw the research of numer-
ous students and mentored 20 doctoral stu-
dents before retiring in 2000.
In addition to his many professional accom-
plishments, Dr. Vela is a public servant. He
was the first Hispanic member elected to the
Denton City Council, and has served on the
Texas Municipal Power Agency Board of Di-
rectors as well as numerous boards and com-
missions.
The G. Roland Vela Athletic Complex is a
fitting tribute to this remarkable North Texan.
I join Dr. Vela’s family, friends, colleagues,
and students in celebrating this well-deserved
honor.

RECOGNIZING KIMBERLEE BURKS
HON. ERIC SWALWELL
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise to recognize the life of
Kimberlee Ann Burks, on the occasion of her
unexpected passing on Thursday, May 30,
2019.
Kimberlee’s roots in Hayward ran deep. She
was born at our very own St. Rose Hospital in
January 1967. She enjoyed spending her
childhood at our local landmarks, like Kennedy
Park and then returned to settle in Hayward in
2015.
For the homeless populations in Hayward
and Alameda County, Kimberlee was a cham-
pion. She modeled what a person could do for
themselves and for other people. Regardless
of whether you recently lost your job, had be-
come a victim of the ever-increasing cost of
housing in the Bay Area, or were struggling
with an addiction, Kimberlee saw you as a
human being first.
The Downtown Streets Team is where
Kimberlee found the support that fostered her
spirit for advocacy. She started as a peer ad-
vocate and peer leader where she introduced
the group and its goals to those in search of
support, work-experience, and secure housing
in our community.
In addition to her work with the Downtown
Streets Team, Kimberlee found community at
Community Resources for Independent Living
(CRIL), where she served as a housing search
coordinator. There she served two vulnerable
communities that she held dear, the homeless
and the disabled through the coordination of
housing search workshops.
Kimberlee volunteered throughout Hayward
and Alameda County to raise awareness and
restore dignity to our homeless population.
Whenever she made a gain of her own in life,
she was always looking for a way to help
someone else.
In 2017, she came to Washington, D.C. and
visited my office to represent and advocate for
the needs of Alameda County’s Healthcare for
the Homeless program. Just days before she
passed away, Kimberlee was in Sacramento
with CRIL and other advocates seeking sup-
port for measures that would provide secure
and stable housing and medical care for those
with disabilities and older adults without ac-
cess to other forms of insurance coverage.
Kimberlee led by doing. She was a force for
good, and she is gone far too soon. She is
survived by her mother, Barbara, and her two
sons, Austin and Preston. They have my
deepest condolences.
HONORING THE LIFE OF
CHRISTOPHER KELLY RAPP
HON. ABIGAIL DAVIS SPANBERGER
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, it is
with great sadness today that I rise to honor
the life of Mr. Christopher Kelly Rapp, a hus-
band, son, musician, and public servant from
Virginia’s 7th Congressional District whose life
was taken too early on May 31 of this year.
Friends and colleagues describe Mr. Rapp
as empathetic, honest, and helpful. As a pub-
lic works employee for Virginia Beach, Staf-
ford, and Powhatan, he dedicated much of his
working career to improving the lives of those
around him. A man of deep faith, Mr. Rapp
was also a devoted volunteer. In fact, he was
scheduled to volunteer at an event to help the
less fortunate on June 5th—an event which he
was never able to attend.
In addition to his commitment to service, Mr.
Rapp was known for the true and abiding love
he possessed for his wife, Bessie. When they
met, she was a travel agent and he wanted to
travel the world. As husband and wife, they
spent 24 years traveling it together. This abid-
ing love also led to Mr. Rapp embracing his
wife’s culture by becoming an active member
of Kultura Filipino. Through this group, he
learned Filipino dances, empowered Pinoy
children by teaching them about Filipino cul-
ture, and made his home a central location for
all types of cultural communities from the
Tidewater to Central Virginia.
Chris loved the experiences of life and was
a life-long learner. Whether it was buying a
Tagalog dictionary on his wedding day, start-
ing piano lessons in his mid-50s, or avidly
writing short stories, he capitalized on every
second of life. He was renowned for his pas-
sionate performances on the bagpipe and
served as a member of Greater Richmond
Pipes & Drums, as well as Tidewater Pipes &
Drums. These bands remember him for his
love for music and eagerness to share his
sound with the community.
I am heartbroken by the death of Mr. Rapp
during the senseless shooting at the Virginia
Beach Municipal Center. While I know that I
can offer no true consolation, I offer my pray-
ers and heartfelt sympathy to Mr. Rapp’s wife,
parents, family, and friends.
Madam Speaker, please join me today in
commemorating the life of Mr. Christopher
Kelly Rapp.

OF NEVADA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Ms. TITUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to recog-

occasion of his retirement from political life.
Councilman Bob Coffin was elected to rep-
resent Las Vegas Ward 3 on Tuesday, June
7, 2011, and was sworn into office on
Wednesday, July 6, 2011. Councilman Coffin

CORRECTION
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E772 June 13, 2019
Councilman Coffin’s commitment to South-
ern Nevada can be seen through his decades
of public service. He was first elected in 1982
to the Nevada Assembly, where he served for
two terms. He continued his public service in
the Nevada State Senate, where he served
until 2011. During that period, he served on
many influential committees as a ranking
member of the powerful Senate Finance Com-
mittee as well as chairman of the Taxation
Committee. On these committees he fought to
balance budgets and cut unnecessary govern-
ment spending. Fiscal responsibility continued
to be a priority as he served Ward 3 along
with ensuring public safety, cleaning up older
neighborhoods, and attracting new develop-
ment.
During his childhood in Las Vegas, Council-
man Coffin developed a passion for two
things—his Mexican-American heritage and
the sport of golf. His ancestral family emi-
grated to Southern California from Mexico,
and he saw firsthand the discrimination his
mother faced as a young woman. Accordingly,
the Councilman has spent much of his career
fighting this injustice. He has traveled to Cen-
tral America to monitor elections and to help
children and families. He has also been a
longtime active member in the Latin Chamber
of Commerce.
Bob remained in Southern Nevada as a
young man attending Bishop Gorman High
School and the University of Nevada Las
Vegas, where he earned an accounting de-
gree. He went on to serve his country in the
United States Army and later ran a successful
insurance business. While concentrating on
his studies at UNLV, Bob continued to focus
on his favorite pastime, golf, and was named
the Nevada Amateur Golf Champion at the
age of 27.
Councilman Coffin has been recognized for
his community service, receiving dozens of
awards during his career. Most recently, he
was named Person of the Year by the South-
ern Nevada Chapter of the Professional
Golfers Association and received the Charles
Dick Medal of Honor Award from the United
States National Guard. He has twice been
honored by the Latin Chamber of Commerce
with its Hispanic Citizen Award and Public
Service Award.
He continues his commitment to the public
by serving on a number of boards and com-
missions, including the Board of the Las
Vegas Golf Hall of Fame, Chief Local Elected
Officials Consortium, Commission for the Las
Vegas Centennial, Debt Management Com-
mission, Southern Nevada Regional Planning
Coalition, and the Southern Nevada Water Au-
thority.
Bob is also a dear friend who paid my very
first filing fee when I ran for the Nevada Sen-
ate in 1988. I have looked to him over the
years for advice, support, and encouragement.
I am also close to his lovely wife, Mary
Hausch and look forward to spending quality
time with them in their retirement. Bob has left
an incredible legacy and all Nevadans owe
him a great debt of gratitude.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor

Anna M. Pinellas moved to join her hus-

Having knowledge in securing funds for var-
ious projects, she was hired by the City of Kis-
simmee and was able to secure grants for the
infrastructure around Osceola Square Mall, the
paving of Hill Street, and John Young Park-
way. The first of those grants being $750,000.
She was also hired by Osceola County Gov-
ernment to secure federal funds for projects
which included bringing Head Start back to
Osceola County, refurbishing the Old Court-
house, and the establishment of a Salary Plan
for Osceola County employees.
One of her primary goals was to pursue the
establishment of the Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr. holiday in the city of Kissimmee, City of St.
Cloud, Osceola County and the School Board.
Thirty-four years ago, Pinellas founded Osce-

‘‘TONI’’ HERNANDEZ-SERNA
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, it
is with great pride that I rise today in honor of
Mrs. Antonietta ‘‘Toni’’ Hernandez-Serna
whose commitment to our hometown of San
Antonio is one to be admired. Today marks
the beginning of her retirement after over 20
years of public service; throughout which her
passion for improving her community re-
mained unchanged.
Toni was born on April 20, 1954 in San An-
tonio, Texas to union leaders Louisa and
Jesus Hernandez and is the oldest of six sib-
lings—Yolanda, Jesse, David, Hector, and Ro-
land. Louisa’s community activism is reflected
in Toni’s work as a community organizer.
Upon receiving a Bachelor of Arts in Soci-
ology from Texas State University, Toni found
her calling as an organizer while serving as a
Field Representative with the American Fed-
eration of Labor and Congress of Industrial
Organizations (AFL–CIO) where she led the
implementation of their national policies.
Fulfilling a desire to return home, Toni trans-
ferred from Colorado with her husband of now
28 years, Joe Serna, and their daughter,
Selina Rocha, to take on a position as the Po-
litical and Community Director with the Service
Employees International Union. Throughout
the years, she worked to elect numerous can-
didates into local office who empowered work-
ers’ rights. In 2007, she served as Outreach
Coordinator for Texas State Representative
Mike Villarreal, and later became District Di-
rector in 2010.
In 2013, Toni’s journey lead her to Texas’
20th Congressional District where she served
as my Outreach and District Director. I have
seen firsthand her dedication and persistence
to serve our community. Her tireless efforts
combined with a true passion for public serv-
ice is nothing short of extraordinary. With this
in mind, Toni is a remarkable role model to
Selina Rocha; her nephew, Jesse Rene Her-
nandez; and grandmother to Charlotte Rocha,
and to all of us in the San Antonio community.
Madam Speaker, Mrs. Antonietta ‘‘Toni’’
Hernandez-Serna has played a tremendous
part in moving Texas 20th forward. I thank
Toni for her many years of service and stead-
fast commitment to our hometown. I am proud
to have served the people of Texas 20th with
you.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF
LLOYD TATUM
HON. HAROLD ROGERS
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to pay tribute to the memory of my
mentor and dear friend, the honorable Lloyd
Tatum of Henderson, Tennessee, who suc-
cumbed to cancer at the age of 93.
Given the profound honor of eulogizing
Lloyd, I include in the RECORD the following
sentiments from my remarks in recognition of
a life of such great scope and consequence:
Lloyd inspired all of us with his example of
truthfulness, hard work, wit, adoration to
family and friends, fairness, and morality.
He inspired me to choose law as a career and
became my mentor.
Lloyd’s nickname was ‘‘Happy,’’ as humor
was a mainstay in his life. He truly enjoyed
things funny and his hearty laugh was infec-
tious. His easy-going personality, though,
camouflaged a very serious and determined
hard worker—from his days as a crewman on
the B–24 Liberator of Superfortress at the
end of World War II; to a stint as an FBI
agent; to a mini-career in movies; to a great
career as a highly respected and successful
practicing attorney in all of West Tennessee;
to 10 years as a distinguished appellate jus-
tice in Tennessee’s Court of Criminal Ap-
peals.
I first met Lloyd while a teenager in my
hometown of Monticello, Kentucky. He came
to southern Kentucky to clear the titles for
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as they
were beginning to create Lake Cumberland,

to be a 100-mile-long impoundment of the
Cumberland River. He worked out of a local
law firm’s office on the square in Monticello
where he met and fell in love with my sister,
Inadene Rogers. After a beautiful church
wedding, the new couple was off to New
Haven, Connecticut and the FBI, and later to
Henderson, Tennessee and law practice.
Through frequent family visits, we shared
great times together—great dinners, picnics,
reunions and water skiing on Lake Cum-
berland. It wasn’t long until Aaron came
along and then, shortly, Janice. What a
pair—full of life. Soon, there came Tim, then
little Lloyd and Suzanne—all wonderful, tal-
ented children of happy and loving parents.
But tragedy intervened when their daughter
Janice became deathly ill, and sometime
later, Inadene lost her battle with cancer.
Lloyd immersed himself in his other love—
the law. His law practice and later service as
a great justice on the Tennessee Criminal
Court of Appeals, consumed him. Slowly the
old Lloyd Tatum came back, and though grief
was his constant companion, he regained that
impressionable personality we cherish today.
But, tragedy would come again as his sec-
ond wife, Yvonne, succumbed to cancer.
There will never be another quite like Lloyd
Tatum. The joyful memories of our wonderful
time together will inspire us all until we meet
him again on the other side. An inscription on
the monument over the grave of James Louis
Petigru in Charleston, South Carolina de-
scribes Lloyd much better than my feeble ef-
forts:
‘‘Future times will hardly know how great a
life
This simple stone commemorates—
The tradition of his Eloquence, his
Wisdom and his Wit may fade:
But he lived for ends more durable than
fame,
His Eloquence was the protection of the poor
and wronged;
His Learning illuminated the principles of
Law—
In the admiration of his Peers,
In the respect of his People,
In the affection of his Family,
His was the highest place;
The just need
Of his kindness and forbearance
His dignity and simplicity
His brilliant genius and his unwearied indus-
try
Unawed by Opinion,
Unseduced by Flattery,
Undismayed by Disaster,
He confronted Life with antique Courage
And Death with Christian Hope.’’
f
ST. LOUIS BLUES STANLEY CUP
VICTORY
HON. ANN WAGNER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I am
proud to join with my colleague Representa-
tive LACY CLAY, in congratulating the St. Louis
Blues on their 2019 Stanley Cup Victory.
In 1967, the National Hockey League ex-
panded its roster from the ‘‘Original Six’’ fran-
chises to include an additional six organiza-
tions, bringing the first professional hockey
team to my hometown: the St. Louis Blues.
In each of the team’s first three seasons,
the Blues made it to the Stanley Cup Final.
And in each of those first three championship
series, the Blues were swept, twice by the
Montreal Canadiens and then by the Boston
Bruins.
Since that time, St. Louis has been called
home by some of the greatest players in the
history of the National Hockey League. First
came Bernie Federko, who led the team to
eight straight playoffs. Brett Hull then joined
the team during the 1987–1988 season and
scored more goals than any other player in
franchise history. At the turn of the century, Al
Macinnis and Chris Pronger ushered in a new
era of defensive prowess for the Blues, bring-
ing the team’s consecutive playoff streak to
twenty-five seasons, the third longest in the
history of the National Hockey League at the
time. Still, hockey’s greatest trophy—the Stan-
ley Cup—remained elusive.
Despite over half a century of disappointing
finishes, love and passion for the Blues contin-
ued to take root and flourish in St. Louis. Typi-
cally described as a ‘‘baseball town,’’ St. Louis
embraced their Blues wholeheartedly and pa-
tiently waited for the one year, the one team,
and the one playoff run that would finally bring
the Cup to the Gateway City.
On January 3, 2019, the St. Louis Blues
were dead last in the National Hockey League
rankings. But with the help of a rookie goal-
tender, Jordan Binnington, and new interim
head coach, Craig Berube, the team em-
barked on a franchise-record eleven game win
streak. Over the next four months, the Blues
jumped from last place to second place in the
Western Conference. The Stanley Cup was
once again in the city’s crosshairs.
To begin the 2019 Stanley Cup Playoffs, the
team ventured north and defeated the Win-
nipeg Jets in the first round, then marched
south and beat the Dallas Stars, next turned
west to win the Western Conference Cham-
pionship over the San Jose Sharks, and finally
set their sights east to take on the Boston Bru-
ins in the Stanley Cup Final.
While the Blues mounted their unprece-
dented run toward the playoffs, a new sense
of excitement took over the city. What was
once an unknown team ritual—playing the
1982 song ‘‘Gloria’’ by Laura Branigan after
each win—evolved into tens of thousands of
St. Louisans blasting the record in their
homes, cars, and workplaces to celebrate a
Blues victory, marking each step closer to the
Stanley Cup.
The Blues relished in this admiration and
were quick to give back to the city that sup-
ported them through thick and thin. When a
video went viral of an eleven-year-old
superfan, Laila Anderson, who was suffering
from a rare blood disease, the team rallied
around her. They invited her to every Blues
home playoff game, dubbing her the team’s
‘‘good luck charm.’’ She then accompanied the
Blues to Game 7 of the 2019 Stanley Cup
Final in Boston.
Yesterday, on June 12, 2019, the Blues ac-
complished what many St. Louisans feared
they would never see in their lifetime: the
Stanley Cup being hoisted above the heads of
hockey players emblazoned with the Blue
Note across their chest. The victory marked
the end of the longest Stanley Cup drought in
National Hockey League history, and was ush-
ered in by thousands of Blues fans packed
into the home of the Blues, the Enterprise
Center, the home of the Cardinals, Busch Sta-
dium, and countless homes and sports bars
across the nation.
If one were to ask any St. Louisan, this ac-
complishment meant far more than winning
just a hockey game. It brought together the
entire city under one mission, one team, one
song, and one Note. It is our honor to con-
gratulate the St. Louis Blues on this historic
victory.

HONORING THE LIFE OF CHARLES
CHRISTOPHER REED
HON. BRIAN BABIN
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life and memory of a lifelong public
servant, Kemah Police Chief Charles Chris-
topher ‘‘Chris’’ Reed, who passed away after
a boating accident on June 7, 2019.
Chief Reed began serving his country and
community in the United States Army, where
he was certified as a military policeman after
graduating from the Military Police Academy.
He was soon promoted to Sergeant and
served as a paratrooper until his honorable
discharge in 1990.
In 1991, Chris joined the League City Police
Department where he served in numerous in-
vestigative and training roles. He went on to
serve as the Assistant Chief and later as City
Administrator. During his time in League City,
he graduated from the 210th Session of the
FBI National Academy Command College and
received a Bachelor’s Degree in Business Ad-
ministration from LeTourneau University and a
Master of Science in Criminal Justice from
Sam Houston State University. In 1993, Chief
Reed was awarded the Law Enforcement Pur-
ple Heart for his courage and sacrifice after
being shot in the line of duty.
In 2009, Chris was appointed city manager
for the city of Nassau Bay, a role he held for
six years. He began his own consulting agen-
cy, but a love of public service drew him back
to law enforcement where he served as Chief
of Police for the City of Kemah until his death.
He was selected by the Shepperd Leadership
Institute at the University of Texas–Permian
Basin as Texas’s 2012 Outstanding Local
Leader, and was a finalist for the University of
Houston Public Official of the Year in 2015.
Chief Reed’s passion and support for the
community led him to serve on several boards
and committees that worked to benefit the
Clear Creek Independent School District
(CCISD). In 2016, he was elected to the
CCISD Board of Trustees and had just re-
cently been named the board’s secretary.
Chris is survived by his wife of nearly twen-
ty-nine years, Jana, and their three children,
Logan, Chase, and Alexis. Madam Speaker,
my prayers and condolences remain with the
family, friends, and law enforcement col-
leagues of Chief Reed.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF MR. MALCOLM JOHN
REBENNACK, JR.
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND
OF LOUISIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor the life and legacy of musical icon Mr.
Malcolm John Rebennack, Jr., universally
known as Dr. John. Mr. Rebennack passed
away on Thursday, June 6, 2019 at the age of
77.
During his iconic career, Dr. John won sev-
eral Grammy awards, released more than 30
albums, and was highly regarded not only as
a performer, but also as a songwriter, com-
poser, and producer. His sound played a piv-
otal role in shaping New Orleans culture and
the music that makes it so distinctive.
Dr. John was born on November 20, 1941
in New Orleans’ 3rd Ward. A precocious
young talent, he honed his God-given gifts at
Jesuit High School where he grew immensely
at his craft. His time spent with older musical
peers helped Dr. John lay the foundation for
the success he would enjoy later in his career.
After serving time in the 1960’s, Dr. John
spent some time in Los Angeles, California
before releasing his debut album, ‘‘Gris–Gris’’
in the beginning of 1968. The album, which
could be described as an eclectic mixture of
rock and traditional New Orleans-themed
music, included ‘‘I Walk on Guilded Splinters,’’
which is widely considered one of his most
recognizable songs.
Four years later, Dr. John released ‘‘Dr.
John’s Gumbo’’ followed by ‘‘In the Right
Place’’ in 1973, and ‘‘Desitively Bonnaroo’’ in
1974.
Dr. John performed at several large plat-
forms during his career, including the White
House and the 2006 National Football League
Super Bowl in Detroit where he performed the
national anthem with Aretha Franklin and
Aaron Neville as part of a tribute to New Orle-
ans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
Dr. John was a Rock and Roll Hall-of-Famer
who proudly spread New Orleans culture
through his music. He embodied New Orleans
and personified its bold character. While he
will be sorely missed, his imprint and legacy in
New Orleans history will remain present for a
lifetime to come.
Madam Speaker, I celebrate the life and
legacy of Mr. Malcolm John Rebennack, Jr.

RECOGNIZING ALDERMAN MAR-
GARET LAURINO ON HER RE-
TIREMENT
HON. MIKE QUIGLEY
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to congratulate Alderman Margaret Laurino on
her retirement from her position as Alderman
of the 39th Ward of the City of Chicago.
Born and raised in the very ward that she
served as Alderman, Margaret Laurino has
dedicated her life to providing the strong, com-
munity-minded administration that our city de-
serves. She is an accomplished public servant
who has demonstrated exemplary leadership
in the City Council and worked hard to im-
prove the lives of her constituents in Chicago’s
39th Ward for 25 years.
Margaret ‘‘Marge’’ Laurino was elected by
her colleagues to serve as President Pro Tem-
pore of the Chicago City Council, bestowing
upon her the responsibility to preside over City
Council meetings in the Mayor’s absence. She
served as Chairman of the City Council Com-
mittee on Pedestrian and Traffic Safety as well
as the Committee on Economic, Capital and
Technology Development, and was a member
of the Committees on Budget and Government
Operations; Committees, Rules and Ethics; Fi-
nance; Workforce Development and Audit; and
Zoning, Landmarks, and Building Standards.
Alderman Laurino has been a champion for
Chicago’s youth and an advocate for quality
education throughout her career. During her
time in the ward, she successfully advocated
for the building of new annexes in five existing
schools, in addition to the construction of two
new public schools. She also expanded
healthcare access for students in the ward by
opening new health centers in both the Albany
Park Multicultural Academy and Roosevelt
High School.
Alderman Laurino also oversaw numerous
infrastructure improvements to benefit senior
citizens in her ward. She worked in conjunc-
tion with the City’s Department of Housing to
fund the construction of a 97-unit senior build-
ing, secured funding for senior citizen home
improvement grants, and played an instru-
mental role in the renovation of an outdated
building on North Park Village’s grounds,
which will soon serve as a wellness center for
seniors.
The improvement of the 39th Ward under
Alderman Laurino’s leadership did not just
reach youth and seniors, but the entire com-
munity as well. In 2014 she oversaw the con-
struction of the new Albany Park Library,
which was built to the highest current environ-
mental standards, and features more space
and nearly four times as many free public
computers as the neighborhood’s previous li-
brary. Alderman Laurino also addressed public
safety concerns within the ward by replacing
the outdated 17th District Police station with
new facilities that are home to state-of-the-art
technology and community-oriented meeting
spaces.
The City of Chicago is lucky to have been
served by Margaret Laurino, who improved ac-
cess to fresh, nutritious foods for Chicagoans
by creating the Food Desert Task Force,
championed government transparency by
video streaming all City Council meetings and
fought unethical practices in government by
mandating ethics trainings for all City employ-
ees. Furthermore, Alderman Laurino made our
roads safer and more accessible by banning
texting while bicycling and advancing the first-
ever Pedestrian Plan. Finally, Alderman
Laurino created new opportunities for young
Chicago residents to learn about City govern-
ment operations and to follow in her footsteps
by cultivating careers dedicated to serving the
public through the Aldermanic intern program.
Marge would be the first to tell you that her
family is her first priority and they have pro-
vided support during her entire career; her

RECOGNIZING THE CITY OF
PLEASANTON’S 125TH ANNIVER-
SARY
HON. ERIC SWALWELL
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise to recognize the City of
Pleasanton, California, on the occasion of the
125th anniversary of its founding which will
occur next week on June 18.
The valley where Pleasanton sits has been
a source of valuable resources for over 5,000
years. Prior to the arrival of European settlers,
it was home to wetlands and an immensely di-
verse portfolio of plants and animal life that
sustained generations of Native Americans.
Spanish settlers were drawn to the vast and
plentiful landscape and plentiful water supply
established a ranching and farming culture
that flourished and served as a magnet to oth-
ers that passed through during the California
Gold Rush in the foothills nearby.
In the decades that followed, the area was
named for a Civil War general of the United
States Army and Union cavalry and saw the
arrival of the transcontinental railroads. The
population was approximately 500 people at
the time; however, that would not last long.
The same rich soil that sustained the Native
American populations for so long was then
home to vineyards and hop fields that yielded
a supply that was sought after across the na-
tion and internationally. By 1900, Pleasanton
became home to all of this, in addition to its
own bank and several hotels.
Since that time, growth and development
has only continued. In the 1980s, Pleasanton
broke ground on a massive project that would
change the trajectory of the city and the region
around it. The 850–acre Hacienda Business
Park was the new magnet drawing industry
and economic development into the valley.
With a current population of approximately
85,000, Pleasanton is now home to one of the
top 10 school districts in the State of California
and holds over 1,200 acres of recreational
space that play host to festivals, parades, and
year-round weekly farmers markets.
In recognition of its 125 years of incorpora-
tion, Pleasanton will be holding a Summer of
Celebration, which will begin with a reception
on the anniversary of its founding, June 18,
2019. Throughout the summer, residents of
California’s 15th Congressional District can
take advantage of several events and exhibits
throughout the city.
Congratulations to Pleasanton on their anni-
versary, and good wishes for a summer of fun
and celebration of our local history.
HONORING THE DILLARD HIGH
SCHOOL’S SUPPORTMUSIC MERIT
AWARD
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, it is my
great privilege to rise today to honor Dillard
High School for being the recipient of the 2019
SupportMusic Merit Award by the National As-
sociation of Music Merchants (NAMM).
The Support Music Award recognized Dil-
lard High School for outstanding achievement
in efforts to provide music access and edu-
cation to all students. It recognizes the com-
mitment and dedication of Dillard High School
to music and the arts as innovative learning
opportunities for a well-rounded education. Dil-
lard High School has always supported and
encouraged students in music education from
the beginning, starting with Julian Edwin ‘‘Can-
nonball’’ Adderley teaching jazz to students to
today when students get to work and perform
with professionals at the Broward Center for
Performing Art and the Fort Lauderdale Mu-
seum of Art.
Dillard High School is one of 98 schools
across the nation to be a SupportMusic Merit
Award recipient demonstrating an unwavering
commitment to providing comprehensive
music education. I applaud the hard work and
dedication of each person making Dillard an
exceptional school.
The NAMM Foundation is a nonprofit orga-
nization that advances active participation in
making music throughout a person’s life. The
SupportMusic Award given by NAMM recog-
nizes that Dillard High School is leading the
way with learning opportunities as outlined in
the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA).
ESSA recognizes that music is an important
element of a well-rounded education for all
children.
Madam Speaker, Dillard High School is an
exceptional High School in our community,
one that we can all admire and respect. I com-
mend the students, faculty and staff for their
inspiring commitment to music, and wish them
many more years of continued success.

PRINCE WILLIAM CHAMBER OF

HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
commend the City of Manassas Police Depart-
ment and its outstanding members who have
demonstrated superior dedication to ensuring
the safety of their colleagues and members of
the community and their designation as 2019
Prince William Chamber of Commerce Valor
Award recipients. The annual Valor Awards
ceremony recognizes the remarkable heroism
and bravery above and beyond the line of duty
exemplified by our public safety and law en-
forcement professionals. For the past 33
years, the Prince William Chamber of Com-
merce has paid tribute to police officers, fire-
fighters, and emergency personnel for their
extraordinary service.
Incorporated in 1975, the 10 square miles of
the City of Manassas is located thirty miles
southwest of the Nation’s Capital and sur-
rounded by Prince William County. Recog-
nized as a ‘‘Gold Standard with Excellence
Agency’’ by the Commission on Accreditation
for Law Enforcement Agencies, the City of
Manassas Police Department maintains a
proactive approach to crime prevention built

HONORING SEÑORA DOÑA CRUZ
CORTEZ
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker,
today I rise in honor of Señora Doña Cruz
Cortez, who passed away on May 30, 2019 at
the age of 98. Señora Cortez hails from my
hometown of San Antonio, Texas and is sur-
vived by four generations of Cortez family
members. An entrepreneurial icon, her impact
in our community is unparalleled after decades
of work that has contributed to the overall suc-
cess of San Antonio’s economy, tourism, and
workforce. She will be greatly missed.
Señora Cortez was born on May 2, 1921
near the banks of San Pedro Creek. Señora
Cortez started from humble beginnings but
held strong convictions from the beginning of
the importance of family, culture and commu-
nity.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E776 June 13, 2019
In 1941, shortly after marrying her husband
Señor Pedro ‘‘Pete’’ Cortez, the family opened
Mi Tierra Café in San Antonio’s El Mercado.
From what began as a small three-table
venue, Mi Tierra Café grew into a well-estab-
lished community hub.
After 75 years, Mi Tierra still stands as one
of San Antonio’s cultural institutions. Today,
La Familia Cortez Restaurants represent
iconic local establishments throughout San
Antonio and serves thousands per year.
At the age of 90, Señora Doña Cruz Cortez
retired from La Familia Cortez Restaurants
and left the booming family enterprise to her
grandchildren.
Madam Speaker, the San Antonio commu-
nity mourns the loss of this icon. Señora Doña
Cruz Cortez embodied the American Dream
and its impact on San Antonio better than
most. She was truly remarkable.
I am proud to have known her and seen the
immeasurable impact her warmth, commitment
and dedication had on our community. Al-
though we have lost a pillar in our community,
her legacy will live on.

IN RECOGNITION OF DISTIN-
GUISHED SERVICE CROSS RE-
CIPIENT AARON JACOBSON
HON. SEAN P. DUFFY
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. DUFFY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the heroism of WWII veteran, Aaron
Jacobson, who through his actions was
awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.
Mr. Jacobson enlisted in the Army at the
age of 32 and shipped off to fight against the
evils of National Socialism in WWII. He landed
on the beaches of Normandy and fought all
the way through to the Battle of the Bulge,
where he was awarded the second oak leaf
cluster on his Purple Heart Award after his fin-
ger was severed by a German bullet.
Mr. Jacobson’s military records were de-
stroyed in a series of fires. One took place in
1973 at the National Personnel Records Cen-
ter in St. Louis. His was among the roughly
16–18 million records containing individual sto-
ries of American servicemen destroyed in that
fire. The other fire tragically took his home and
the life of his brother.
Aaron’s family and friends spent tireless
hours combing through records, newspaper
articles, websites and their recollection of his
personal stories to re-construct the events of
that day. Although we do not have the exact
wording of his citation, I would like to tell you
what happened on the day that Mr. Jacobson
earned his Distinguished Service Cross.
On September 21, 1944, somewhere in the
Parroy Forest of France, the 313th Infantry
Regiment, of the 79th Infantry Division, in
which Private First Class Aaron Jacobson was
serving, was mopping up a battlefield that had
just been cleared. Suddenly, machine gun fire
split the air and his men hit the ground. PFC
Jacobson, without regard to his own life, low
crawled towards a position from which he
could flank the machine gun nest. As he ap-
proached the nest, he realized his rifle was full
of mud and wouldn’t fire. Undeterred, he fixed
his bayonet and stabbed the rear guard of the
nest. Using the firearm captured from the Ger-
man solider he had just killed, he neutralized
the remaining three Germans in the machine
gun nest. PFC Aaron Jacobson’s heroic ac-
tions that day saved many American lives, and
we as a nation owe him a great debt of grati-
tude.

HONOR FLIGHT OF OREGON
HON. GREG WALDEN
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize one Vietnam veteran, nine World
War II veterans and thirteen Korean War vet-
erans from Oregon who are visiting their me-
morials on the National Mall on Friday, June
14, 2019, through Honor Flight of Oregon.
Every time I have the chance to meet one of
these heroes, I am reminded of the poignant
words of General Dwight D. Eisenhower. In a
message to Allied troops just before D-Day,
he said, ‘‘The eyes of the world are upon you.
The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people
everywhere march with you.’’
He was right then, of course, Madam
Speaker. But over seventy years later, liberty-
loving people everywhere continue to owe
these heroes for their extraordinary service
and their incredible stories of sacrifice and
bravery on behalf of our country. That’s why it
is my privilege to include in the RECORD their
names today.
The veterans on this Honor Flight from Or-
egon are as follows: David Bagley, Marine
Corps; Willis Bennett, Navy; Mount Blevins,
Army; William Cadman, Marine Corps; William
Collins, Navy; Marjorie Cook, Army; Lorin Cul-
ver, Army; Frederic DeGanna, Air Force; Wal-
ter Dye, Navy; Charles Elson, Army; Morris
Fruitman, Navy; Ronald Gutekunst, Air Force;
Harry Krogman, Air Force; Jack Lakey, Navy;
Vernon Lesher, Navy; Harold Mehrten, Air
Force and Navy; Charles Nagy Jr., Navy;
Henry Nussbaum, Navy; Walter Ridge, Navy;
Bobby Ruth, Army; Jack Thompson, Army;
Gerald Wellington, Air Force and Navy; and
William Wilson, Army.
These twenty-three heroes join over
200,000 veterans who have been honored
through the Honor Flight Network of volun-
teers nationwide since 2005.
I would also like to recognize the ten guard-
ians traveling on this trip who have also
served our country: Anginette Echols, Navy;
Terry Haines, Navy; Daniel Johnson, Navy;
Ronald Kohl, Air Force and Army; Mark
Libante, Army; Peter Pringle, Navy; Walter
Ridge Jr., Navy; Rachael Watters, Army; Ken-
neth Wilson, Navy; and Tanya Wilson, Navy.
Madam Speaker, at the height of the Civil
War in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln
wrote, ‘‘Honor to the Soldier, and Sailor every-
where, who bravely bears his country’s
cause.’’ Each of us in this chamber and in this
nation should be humbled by the courage of
these brave veterans who put themselves in
harm’s way for our country and way of life. As
a nation, we can never fully repay the debt of
gratitude owed to them for their honor, com-
mitment, and sacrifice in defense of the free-
doms we have today.
My colleagues, please join me in thanking
these veterans and the volunteers of Honor
Flight of Oregon for their exemplary dedication
and service to this great country.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF CHEF LEAH LANGE CHASE
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND
OF LOUISIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, June 13, 2019
Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor the life and legacy of Chef Leah Lange
Chase, New Orleans’ matriarch of Creole cui-
sine, who fed civil rights leaders, musicians
and presidents in a career spanning seven
decades. Mrs. Chase passed away on Satur-
day, June 1, 2019 at the age of 96.
Mrs. Chase was born on January 6, 1923 in
Madisonville, Louisiana. Her parents, Charles
Lange and Hortensia Lange, raised 13 chil-
dren. When she was 13 years old, Mrs. Chase
moved to live with her aunt in New Orleans,
so she could attend St. Mary’s Academy.
Upon graduation, Mrs. Chase took on sev-
eral different jobs before she finally entered
into the culinary industry as a French Quarter
restaurant waitress. After meeting Edgar
‘‘Dooky’’ Chase Jr. in 1946 and eventually
marrying him three months later, she trans-
formed his family’s sandwich stand into a full-
fledged restaurant known as ‘‘Dooky Chase’’
that served as the only top-tier dining option
available to African Americans in New Orle-
ans.
During the following decade, Dookie Chase
became a key location for leaders of the Civil
Rights movement to come together, organize,
and discuss pressing social issues. ore broad-
ly, countless black entertainers and icons
dined at her restaurant including James Bald-
win, Thurgood Marshall, Quincy Jones, and
Ray Charles.
In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina ravaged
her home and her restaurant with devastating
flood waters . However, it was her steadfast
determination and sheer will to rebuild the res-
taurant that made it possible to re-open its
doors a mere two years later.
Mrs. Chase’s talent and contributions led to
numerous accolades, including awards from
the James Beard Foundation, the NAACP,
and Southern Foodways Alliance. In her
honor, the Southern Food and Beverage mu-
seum even named a permanent gallery after
her.
Mrs. Chase served on several boards in-
cluding the New Orleans Museum of Art, the
Arts Council of New Orleans, the Louisiana
Children’s Museum, the Urban League of
Greater New Orleans, and the Greater New
Orleans Foundation.
Mrs. Chase was known to most as the leg-
endary Queen to Creole Cuisine, but to me,
she was a close friend , mentor, and source
of inspiration. Her passion and skill in culinary

arts served as a vessel not only to bring peo-
ple together at a time when our nation faced
racial strife and segregation, but also as a way
to heal communities, champion the Civil
Rights movement, and transcend institutional
barriers to success.
Mrs. Chase’s personable demeanor made
her the matriarch of New Orleans. Her heart
and soul touched the lives of so many who
traveled from far and wide to experience the
iconic cuisine of Dooky Chase Restaurant. I
cherish the time spent with Mrs. Chase and
offer my sincere condolences to the Chase
family.
While she will be sorely missed, her imprint
and legacy in New Orleans history and culture
will remain present for a lifetime to come.
Mrs. Chase is survived by her son, Edgar
Chase III; her two daughters, Leah Chase
Kamata and Stella Chase Reese.; in addition
to siblings, grandchildren and great-grand-
children.
Madam Speaker, I celebrate the life and
legacy of Chef Leah Lange Chase.

award winners of Freedom High School at the
Outstanding Eagles Award Ceremony. Each of
these students are being honored for their re-
silient high school careers and the positive im-

achievements as well as their determination to
overcome hurdles throughout their academic
careers. These students were able to take on
adversity head on and show what resilient in-
dividuals they are. I’m sure the challenges
they endured makes the journey and this ac-
complishment that much more satisfying, and
this hard work will be vital in their future ca-
reer paths as they enter higher education and
the work field. But with students like this, I
know we are in good hands. They are well
prepared to face tomorTow’s challenges, and
I look forward to hearing of the many accom-
plishments they reach. They will be the future
leaders of our country and I am happy that
these outstanding students were developed
out of Prince William County. It is truly my
honor, to include in the RECORD the following
