PRAYER
Reverend Alisa Lasater Wailoo, Cap-
itol Hill United Methodist Church,
Washington, D.C., offered the following
prayer:
O, God, it is Friday. As we look back
on the week, we remember Yom
Kippur, the Day of Atonement, at-one-
ment, where our Jewish siblings spend
25 hours fasting from quick satisfac-
tion and allowing You to reveal the fal-
sities we all feast upon.
Following their wisdom, let us do the
same. Before we begin our work here,
inquire of us, Lord, are we seeking
truth or expediency? Inquire of us,
Lord, are we choosing courage or com-
fort? Inquire of us, Lord, are we hoping
for healing or using the division for our
own gain?
Merciful God of all forgiveness, com-
passion, truth, and power, come into
the people’s House and all the districts
where we reside today. Fill our hearts,
our homes, and our town hall meetings
with Your spirit, that we may break
free from the comfort of caucusing
with our own, and make us one not
only with You, but all Your children of
this great land.
Amen.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF THE
AFRICAN AMERICAN
BATEAUMEN OF THE JAMES
RIVER
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor and remember the legacy of the African
American Bateaumen of the James River.
These men played critical roles in establishing
the economy of colonial Virginia, and it is im-
perative we honor and remember their work.
The James River Bateau, a series of flat-
bottomed wooden cargo vessels first used in
the 1770’s, was the primary means of trans-
porting goods on the James River until 1840.
Crews of men performed the difficult, dan-
gerous, and physically demanding work of
moving tobacco and other goods and services
up and down the river, connecting Richmond
to the wider world. Their efforts helped make
the City of Richmond a regional hub for indus-
try and commerce.
I am pleased that the Commonwealth is rec-
ognizing the profound impact of the African
American Bateaumen of the James River with
a historical highway marker designation from
the Virginia Department of Historic Resources.
By highlighting the experiences of these men,
this highway marker helps us achieve a more
inclusive understanding of our shared history.
Madam Speaker and colleagues, please join
me in honoring the legacy of the African
American Bateaumen. Their contributions to
colonial Virginia were formative in growing the
Commonwealth’s economy, and I am grateful
for their work. This landmark designation will
help us remember the important work they did
and preserve their legacy for future genera-
tions.

IN RECOGNITION OF TAIWAN’S
NATIONAL DAY
HON. MARK MEADOWS
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. MEADOWS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Taiwan’s National Day. On
October 10th, Taiwan celebrated the 108th an-
niversary of the Republic of China. On the oc-
casion of Taiwan’s National Day, I congratu-
late the people of Taiwan on this important an-
niversary and express the sincere commitment
of our nation and Congress to the bilateral re-
lationship. As security, diplomatic, and eco-
nomic challenges in the Pacific region grow, it
is vital for our mutual security that the bond
between the United States and Taiwan re-
mains strong.
I am proud to support our continued de-
fense partnership, trading relationship, and a
shared belief in democracy and human dignity
that stands in stark contrast to the behavior of
the government on the mainland. The United
States and Taiwan have built an alliance that
can withstand future threats, and to which I
know President Trump and his administration
is committed to preserving. I also want to
commend the Americans serving in the Amer-
ican Institute in Taiwan for their patriotism and
commitment to preserving this critical partner-
ship.
We cannot be complacent when the Chi-
nese Communist Party in Beijing attempts to
export authoritarianism and corruption and
tries to weaken our democratic allies. I en-
courage my colleagues to support measures
to stop Beijing’s ongoing attempts to under-
mine Taiwan’s participation in international
fora and its increased disruption of Taiwan’s
diplomatic ties.
From its beginning over a century ago to its
embrace of a vibrant democracy today, the
Republic of China (Taiwan) shares a bond
with the United States founded on common
principles. As Taiwan celebrates Double Ten
Day, I extend my best wishes and congratu-
late the Taiwanese people for all they have
achieved.

HONORING THE CAREER OF
LAURA HAND
HON. JOHN KATKO
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the career of Laura Hand as she retires
after 47 years as a celebrated journalist in
Central New York.
For nearly five decades, Laura Hand has
been a trusted source for news in our commu-
nity, a household name in broadcasting, and
beloved by many in Central New York.
Throughout her career, she has told countless
community stories, inspired rising journalists,
and used her platform to raise awareness for
childhood literacy.
Born in a military family in Virginia, Laura
Hand spent much of her childhood travelling
around the world to countries including Eng-
land, Germany, Thailand, and Italy. Devel-
oping an interest in news and politics at a
young age, Laura Hand followed this passion
and enrolled in Syracuse University’s Maxwell
School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, where
she studied journalism and political science.
While a student at Syracuse University, Laura
Hand became the first woman to direct the
campus radio station, WAER. After graduating
in 1971, she took her first full-time position as
a radio news reporter with WFBL in Syracuse,
NY.
In 1972, Laura Hand transitioned from radio
to television, joining the NBC 3 broadcast
team. Throughout her reputable career with
NBC 3, she held a number of positions, but
has become best known for anchoring ‘‘Week-
end Today’’ and ‘‘Monday Night Answer
Desk,’’ where she encouraged viewers to get
involved and have fun in the Central New York
community. Passionate about her community,
for years Laura Hand maintained the ‘‘In Your
Community’’ webpage, a site dedicated to in-
forming residents of the many community
events in Central New York.
Throughout her career, Laura Hand has
interviewed some of the most prominent fig-
ures in American politics, including former
New York State Governor Nelson Rockefeller
and former First Lady Nancy Reagan.
Laura Hand has coupled her prominent ca-
reer in journalism in Central New York with
her passion for reading, and, for more than 30
years, has organized the ‘‘Books Breaks’’
summer reading campaign, an annual pro-
gram that promotes childhood literacy in our
community. She plans to continue this work
into retirement. In addition, she has served as
a long-time member of the Salvation Army/
Syracuse Board.
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues
in the House join me in honoring Laura Hand
for an incredible 47-year career in journalism.
I wish her all the best in her retirement.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE GROUND
BREAKING FOR FORT STREET
BRIDGE PARK AND THE 50TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE ROUGE
RIVER FIRE
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the 50th anniversary of the
Rouge River fire and celebrate the ground
breaking of the new Fort Street Bridge Park.
On October 9, 1969, sparks from an acety-
lene torch ignited debris in the Rouge River.
With flames rising 50 feet into the air, the
burning river quickly became a symbol of soci-
etal indifference to pollution and became a
catalyst for change in our community. Years
before the Rouge fire, the river also served as
an important site for another event that pro-
voked societal transformation. On March 7,
1932, thousands of unemployed auto workers
embarked on a march from Detroit to the Ford
Rouge Factory in Dearborn to protest the eco-
nomic devastation in Detroit’s automotive in-
dustry during the Great Depression. In a pain-
ful part of our community’s history, the march-
ing autoworkers clashed with police and Ford
Motor Company security guards on the historic
Fort Street Bridge above the Rouge River, re-
sulting in the death of five protestors and leav-
ing dozens of others injured. Later known as
the Ford Hunger March, this event laid the
groundwork for the formation of the United
Auto Workers in 1935.
Without a doubt, the Fort Street Bridge and
Rouge River are prominent symbols of De-
troit’s past.
In the half century since the Rouge River
fire, heightened public and political attention to

America’s environmental crisis has generated
both formal legislation like the Clean Water
Act of 1972 and independent action to trans-
form the severe health hazard into a regional
asset. Thanks to the river’s renewed heath
and viability, members of our community have
taken the initiative to commemorate the legacy
of the Ford Hunger March by planning the cre-
ation of a pocket park located at the foot of
the Fort Street Bridge. The new park will
honor our community’s vast history and high-
light the significance of the Rouge River fire
and the Fort Street Bridge for generations of
Michiganders to come.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring the 50th anniversary of the
Rouge River fire and celebrate the ground
breaking of the future Fort Street Bridge Park.
I am grateful for our community’s efforts to en-
sure our history is never forgotten.

HONORING MS. KATHY TEAL
HON. KEN BUCK
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor and celebrate the life and legacy of Ms.
Kathy Teal of Greeley, Colorado.
Kathy Teal was an accomplished woman
who always kept the needs of women and
children at heart and fought hard for life. Ms.
Teal dedicated her career to serving teenage
and unwed pregnant mothers, working as a
certified midwife. In the 1980s, Kathy was part
of a group that founded Birthright of Greeley
where she served as a counselor and later as
the organization’s director. She also played an
instrumental role in drafting and advocating for
the law legalizing lay midwifery in the state of
Colorado.
From 2002 until her passing on March 21,
2019, she helped found and was actively in-
volved in the Genesis Project of Northern Col-
orado, a faith-based, nonprofit organization
serving single mothers and their children. She
later served on the Executive Board and the
Advisory Board, continually guiding this orga-
nization with her passion to protect life.
Madam Speaker, I would like to honor Ms.
Kathy Teal for all her contributions to Eastern
Colorado and recognize the profound legacy
that she leaves behind. It is an honor to cele-
brate her impact on our community and state.

CELEBRATING THE 300TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF AMITY TOWNSHIP
HON. DANIEL MEUSER
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is with
great respect and appreciation that I rise today
to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the
Township of Amity, Pennsylvania.
The oldest incorporated township in Berks
County, Amity predates the county itself. Set-
tled by Swedish settlers on land granted by
William Penn in 1701, Amity is home to the
county’s oldest structure, the Mouns Jones
House, which was built in 1716, as well as St.
Gabriel’s Church, Berks County’s first orga-
nized religious congregation. Among Amity’s
other contributions to history is the White
Horse Inn, which served as a gathering place
for officers of the Continental Army during the
American Revolution and was visited by Presi-
dent George Washington in 1793. The Historic
Preservation Trust of Berks County has been
instrumental in preserving Amity’s rich history
as part of Morlatton Village.
Amity’s 300th anniversary has been her-
alded with great celebration. Events com-
memorating the township’s tricentennial have
brought the people of Amity together to recall
and celebrate their longstanding sense of
community that was the foundation of its es-
tablishment 300 years ago. Amity has re-
mained a strong community because it holds
the same values as at its founding.
On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives and the citizens of Pennsylvania’s Ninth
Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to
join me and the great people who call Amity
home in celebrating 300 years and wishing
them many more years of community and
prosperity.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the career of Dr. Rodney Allen
Mortenson of Greensboro, North Carolina on
the eve of his retirement.
Dr. Mortenson has practiced sports medi-
cine and orthopedic surgery for nearly five
decades in the Greensboro and Eden areas.
He has been a stalwart of the medical com-
munity, expertly servicing the needs of his pa-
tients while expanding the knowledge within
the orthopedic field more broadly. Through his
service as a faculty clinical professor of ortho-
pedic surgery at the Bowman Gray School of
Medicine and authorship of numerous pub-
lished studies, Dr. Mortenson’s intellectual
contributions to his field and positive impact
on future surgeons have been measurable.
In 1976, Dr. Mortenson founded the Sports
Medicine and Orthopedic Center in Greens-
boro specializing in trauma care, joint function,
and hand and foot surgery. Countless patients
have come to see Dr. Mortenson with serious,
debilitating afflictions and left his office with a
new lease on life.
Dr. Mortenson now steps into a new phase
of life, retirement, with the love and support of
his wife Linda and daughters Ashley, Julie,
and Lindsay. I am beyond grateful for the work
Dr. Mortenson performed in a community that
we both care deeply about, and I wish him
only happiness in the years to come.
Madam Speaker, please join me today in
celebrating the career of Dr. Rodney Allen
Mortenson and honoring his service to the city
of Greensboro.
RECOGNIZING STU SKAUGE,
TOMMY SPENCER, AND SHANA
THORNTON FOR THEIR INDUC-
TION INTO THE UPPER PENIN-
SULA LABOR HALL OF FAME
HON. JACK BERGMAN
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it’s my
honor to recognize the lives and service of Stu
Skauge, Tommy Spencer, and Shana Thorn-
ton on the occasion of their induction into the
Upper Peninsula Labor Hall of Fame. Through
a lifetime of unparalleled service and devotion
to the public good, these three leaders have
become indispensable parts of the state of
Michigan.
The U.P. Labor Hall of Fame was estab-
lished in 1993 to recognize unionists who
have made an outstanding contribution to the
cause of worker dignity and workplace fair-
ness. With their lifetimes in service to their fel-
low workers, Shana, Tommy, and Stu are all
clearly deserving of this honor.
Stu Skauge served as a Michigan school
teacher for 33 years. As a member of the
Michigan Education Association (MEA), Stu
served as president-elect, president, and chief
negotiator for his bargaining unit in the Mar-
quette Area Public Schools district for over 25
years. He would go on to become the MEA
UniServ director in Marquette and Alger Coun-
ties for another 10 years before his retirement.
He has remained a dedicated leader in retire-
ment, serving on the Ishpeming City Council
and continuing to be active with the MBA-Re-
tired organization. Stu also served as a Ser-
geant E-5 in the Korean War and is a life
member and former commander of the
Ishpeming VFW.
As a member of the United Steelworkers for
38 years, Tommy Spencer served as a leader,
trainer, and activist for on-the-job health and
safety, eventually becoming the Company
Committee Safety Chairperson. His efforts
were critical in forming the Steelworkers Coali-
tion and establishing the Worker Memorial
Day event—helping to remember workers
killed or injured on the job and continue the
fight for stronger safety and health protections.
Tommy has devoted countless hours to volun-
teer work and public service through organiza-
tions like the Marquette County Labor Council,
the Cliff’s Shaft Mining Museum Board, the
Negaunee Township Building and Recreation
Committee, and the Harley Owners Group.
While she started her career as a teacher’s
aide, Shana Thornton quickly found her calling
as a union activist—serving as steward, chap-
ter chair, and local president in her local orga-
nization. Her drive led her to become a Staff
Representative for the American Federation of
State, County, and Municipal Employees
(AFSCME) before ultimately serving as the Di-
rector of Field Services for AFSCME Council
25, where she supervised 23 Staff Represent-
atives across the state of Michigan. Shana
was the first and only woman to serve as
President of the Marquette County Labor
Council. She also served at the state-level on
the Michigan AFL-CIO General Board and the
Michigan Labor-Management Council, rep-
resenting the U.P.
Madam Speaker, induction into the U.P.
Labor Hall of Fame is a tremendous honor

rights and well-being of fellow workers. None
are more deserving of this honor than Stu
Skauge, Tommy Spencer, and Shana Thorn-
ton. Michiganders can take great pride in
knowing the First District is home to such
dedicated leaders. On behalf of my constitu-
ents, I wish them all the best in their future en-
deavors.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE AMER-
ICAN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the American Human
Rights Council. Their exemplary efforts in de-
fending and protecting human rights are wor-
thy of commendation.
The American Human Rights Council
(AHRC) was founded in 2014 as a non-profit
organization committed to protecting, pro-
moting, and defending human rights as de-
fined by the U.S. Constitution and outlined in
the United Nations’ 1948 Universal Declaration
of Human Rights. Since its inception, the
AHRC has worked tirelessly with community
leaders and human rights advocacy organiza-
tions to intervene in situations where human
rights are at risk. Through high-level legislative
work, media outreach, and grassroots mobili-
zation, the AHRC strives to protect individuals
whose rights are being violated regardless of
geographical or other boundaries.
The AHRC’s Annual Community Forum and
Dinner Reception exemplifies the council’s
continued commitment to protecting and uplift-
ing human rights worldwide. The 2019 forum
titled ‘‘Human Trafficking: Universal Challenge,
Common Responsibility’’ will focus on the
challenges of human trafficking and generate
awareness of its prevalence on a local, na-
tional, and global scale. Human trafficking
constitutes a serious human rights violation
and must be handled with the upmost care
and concern. Thus, the AHRC strives to use
its platform to educate attendees further on
the impacts of human trafficking and provide
opportunities to learn about ways to combat
this alarming human rights crisis.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring the American Human Rights
Council. The AHRC’s meaningful work plays a
crucial role in protecting human rights world-
wide, and we are grateful for the tremendous
dedication to solving the world’s toughest
human rights challenges.

HONORING CALFIRE FIRE CAPTAIN
PAUL ROTONDARO
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor CalFire Fire Captain Paul Rotondaro.
Mr. Rotondaro served the State of California
during his distinguished career with CalFire,
until he was tragically killed in a head-on colli-
sion while on-duty on October 2nd, 2019.
Mr. Rotondaro began his career in 2006 as
a Firefighter 1 at the Ahwahnee Firestation in
the Madera-Mariposa-Merced Unit of CAL
FIRE. He was promoted to a Firefighter II in
2011 and in 2012 was promoted to Lieutenant
Fire Apparatus Engineer in the Madera-
Mariposa-Merced Unit then transferred to the
Riverside Unit as a permanent Fire Apparatus
Engineer in 2015. In 2016, Mr. Rotondaro was
made a permanent Fire Captain in the
Madera-Mariposa-Merced Unit. In 2018, he
was selected as the Merced County Firefighter
of the Year.
In both his personal and professional life,
Mr. Rotondaro was a lover of the outdoors. He
was an avid outdoorsman, he enjoyed camp-
ing, off-roading, boating, and many more out-
door activities.
Paul is survived by his loving wife Jennifer,
his daughter Kiersten and his son Wyatt Dune.
He is also survived by his father, Vincent
Rotondaro, parents, Michael and Toni
McMillin, his siblings, grandparents and many
family and friends.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring the life and service of Fire
Captain Paul Rotondaro. His sacrifice in serv-
ice to our community will always be appre-
ciated and remembered. I ask that you join me
and his family in celebrating his great life.

HONORING THE WORK OF ELVIRA
RAMOS
HON. JOE NEGUSE
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, there are
people in every community who are the gears
that make the entire engine run, and who
make their homes better, stronger and more
interconnected. On the precipice of her retire-
ment, I wish to honor one of those people
from my community, Elvira Ramos. For over a
decade, Elvira served the Community Founda-
tion of Boulder County in grantmaking,
mentorship, and as co-director of the Leader-
ship Fellows Program. We have been blessed
by her service and commitment to all of us,
and now it is our chance to honor her.
An experienced trainer and facilitator, one of
Elvira’s greatest gifts to the Colorado commu-
nity is her willingness to mentor and further
the leadership skills of others, focusing espe-
cially on those from communities that are too
often overlooked. She has led workshops in
board and leadership development, inclusive
leadership, volunteer management and stra-
tegic planning. Elvira convenes thoughtful,
thorough conversations that tackle critical sub-
jects and empower others with knowledge and
expertise which they can pay forward to create
a more just and representative society.
Elvira has made inclusivity and diversity pil-
lars of her work. As an activist and philan-
thropist, she has built beloved and vital local
organizations, ensuring that these organiza-
tions were always reaching outwards and cre-
ating more space at the table. Elvira has
worked to create permanent and positive
change through civic engagement and has
built a foundational legacy upon which new
community leaders will stand. Each of us are
truly fortunate to feel the effects of her life’s
work.
One of Elvira’s favorite quotes comes from
Lao Tzu: ‘‘A leader is best when people barely
know he exists, when his work is done, his
aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.’’
Though for countless Coloradans Elvira has
emulated this exact form of leadership, kindly
and gently guiding so many of us on a right-
eous path, today I would like to shine a bright
light on her myriad contributions and powerful
influence for good. The Colorado community
wishes Elvira happiness and relaxation in her
retirement, and sends our endless gratitude
for her many contributions.

HONORING THE LIFE OF FORMER
AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE, WIL-
LIAM GREEN MILLER
HON. MARCY KAPTUR
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay
respectful tribute to the gifted, compassionate,
and persevering life of American diplomat Wil-
liam Green Miller, our nation’s second Ambas-
sador to Ukraine following the collapse of the
Soviet Union in 1991.
A highly trusted advisor and valued friend to
Members of Congress, and the diplomatic and
intelligence communities, Ambassador Miller’s
distinguished service to our nation elevated
the possibilities and promise of liberty to peo-
ple living in nations that had never known
freedom.
He dedicated his life at liberty’s edge with
great humility. His steady, unselfish, and tena-
cious nature allowed him to tackle infinitely
complex situations— Iran, the Soviet Union,
Ukraine—and advise ways forward. He never
really retired and remained engaged and in-
sightful during his golden years.
A renaissance man, Ambassador Miller’s
career spanned assignment in Iran, staff direc-
tor of the Senate Intelligence Committee, sen-
ior Administrator and professor at Tufts Uni-
versity, chairman of the board of the Kyiv
Mohyla Foundation, and president of the
American Committee on U.S.-Soviet Relations.
Upon leaving Congress, the U.S. Senate rec-
ognized his leadership by passing a special
resolution commending him for ‘‘contributions
and for his dedication, loyalty, integrity, and
service.’’
Simply, he was exceptional.
It is with deepest condolences that I offer
sympathy to his beautiful wife Suzanne, their
two sons, and extended family at this difficult
time.
May the life he has lived continue to inspire
a new generation of Americans to embrace his
calling to scholarship, service, and patriotic
commitment to liberty’s cause at home and
abroad.

WILLIAM GREEN MILLER, SECOND US AMBAS-
SADOR TO INDEPENDENT UKRAINE, DIES AT
AGE 88
William Green Miller, who served as U.S.
ambassador to Ukraine in the 1990s as the
euphoria of national independence gave way
to the misery of economic destitution for
many Ukrainians. died in his home in north-
ern Virginia on Sept. 23, according to
friends. He was 88. He served as America’s
second ambassador in Kyiv, from 1993–1998,
and is the first of nine American ambas-
sadors to independent Ukraine to have died.

His death was confirmed by friends, includ-
ing Marta Farion, a Ukrainian-American in
Chicago who worked with Miller on the Kyiv
Mohyla Foundation of America, raising
money to support the university with 5,000
students in Kyiv. Farion spoke to Miller’s
wife, Suzanne Lisle Miller, and said that the
ambassador died in his home ‘‘one minute
before noon’’ on Sept. 23, in the company of
their two sons, William and Christopher, and
grandchildren. ‘‘He was surrounded by his
leather-bound books, in front of the beau-
tiful garden that he and Suzanne cultivated
and loved all their lives, with the blooming
flowers and many butterflies that bid him
farewell,’’ Farion told the Kyiv Post.
Miller’s tenure as ambassador coincided
with momentous events under Ukraine’s
first president, Leonid Kravchuk, who served
from 1991–1994, and then Leonid Kuchma,
who ruled from 1994–2005. During Millers era,
Ukraine adopted a Constitution, launched
the national currency, the hryvnia, and
signed the Budapest Memorandum in which
Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United
States offered security assurances to
Ukraine for surrendering its Soviet-era nu-
clear arsenal.
The agreement now is derided by many in
Ukraine as a worthless piece of paper, con-
sidering Russia’s dismemberment of
Ukraine—including seizing Crimea and parts
of the eastern Donbas—as the Kremlin pros-
ecutes a war in its sixth year that has killed
13,000 people. His term also witnessed
Ukrainian lawlessness and the rise of the oli-
garchy, which still plagues the nation today.
But his friends say that Miller always
found the beauty in Ukraine, despite its
hardships. Farion described Miller as ‘‘a
writer and poet, a Renaissance man in every
respect and Suzanne was his muse, his ad-
viser, and his protector to the very end. They
loved Ukraine since the days when he was
ambassador there. To the end, he wanted to
know what is taking place in Ukraine.’’ She
said that ‘‘Bill and Suzanne were responsible
for the establishment and renovation of the
historic building in the Podil neighborhood
that became the residence of the American
ambassador, and they paid special attention
to the garden, restoring the original plants,
trees, and flowers that were cultivated there
when the building was first built. They paid
attention to the historical artifacts that
were recovered while rebuilding the resi-
dence, and they hosted many Ukrainian art-
ists, historians, musicians, and writers
there.’’
Said Farion: ‘‘Bill embraced his role as
chairman of the board of the Kyiv Mohyla
Foundation with all his vigor and believed in
the power of education and the role of Kyiv-
Mohyla Academy in building Ukraine as a
democratic country, where rule of law and
human rights were priorities. He was hon-
ored by Kyiv-Mohyla Academy with an hon-
orary doctorate and spoke on the stage of
the university to students on many occa-
sions. He inspired me to push forward, to
never give up, to stand up for the truth. He
was my mentor in many respects and taught
me not to be afraid. He loved the principles
upon which the United States was estab-
lished and he truly believed in those prin-
ciples. He was an admirer of Thomas Jeffer-
son. He was a scholar. He left a book of po-
etry and many writings. I will miss him and
his guidance.’’
Monica Eppinger served as the second sec-
retary to Miller in the U.S. Embassy in
Ukraine and recalled her work with him as
‘‘the best time.’’ To the end, she said ‘‘he
wanted to be a good friend of Ukraine.’’ ‘‘I
was part of that small early team during
Ambassador Millers tenure in Ukraine. He
had headed the Washington side of a late’
Soviet human rights organization, and
through it was thoroughly acquainted with
the cases of the major human rights heroes
of the last decade of the U.S.S.R. When he
got to Ukraine, he already had made com-
mon cause with some—Mustafa Dzhemilev,
Vyacheslav Chornovil, Semen Gluzman. Any-
one who’d done Soviet prison time for advo-
cating human rights was a part of his ‘team.’
He was a fervent Jeffersonian democrat. He
also worked very closely with Voldoymyr
Horbulin (former secretary of the Ukrainian
National Security and Defense Council). es-
pecially on denuclearization, and to the best
of my knowledge respected him and appre-
ciated him as a pragmatic strategic thinker
who cared about Ukrainian independence.’’
During Miller’s ambassadorial tenure,
Eppinger said, he took a keen interest in
people working on human rights and advo-
cating freedom of speech, religion and the
press.
‘‘He was just really interested in the
project of independent Ukraine and really in-
terested in Ukrainians,’’ said Eppinger, a
professor at St. Louis University School of
Law and director of its Center for Inter-
national and Comparative Law. He’d meet
with anybody practically who wanted to
meet with him.’’ She said Miller was also in-
terested in archaeology and remembers him
stopping frequently to visit the excavation
site of what is now the rebuilt Mikhailovsky
Cathedral in Kyiv. ‘‘All the archaeologists at
the site knew him.’’ she said.
Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Wil-
liam Green Miller delivers remarks at the
observance of the 60th anniversary of the
Voice of America’s Ukrainian Service on
Dec. 11, 2009, at VOA headquarters in Wash-
ington, D.C.
Farion said that she traveled with him and
a team of archaeology students ‘‘to the mag-
nificent Chersonesus in Crimea. He promoted
the site to be protected by UNESCO. The oc-
cupation of Crimea by Russia stung him per-
sonally, not only because of the loss of the
strategic territory but because he realized
that Russian authorities would raid the ar-
chaeological site. He was deeply concerned
for the fate of the Crimean Tatars after Rus-
sia’s invasion and occupation.’’
Eppinger called him a big fan of ballet, es-
pecially Swan Lake. ‘‘He also loved the Phil-
harmonic and actively supported the reha-
bilitation of the Philharmonic building near
the Friendship Arch’’ on the right bank of
the Dnipro River in central Kyiv. She said he
even vacationed in Ukraine, taking driving
tours to explore ancient wooden churches of
the Carpathian Mountains in western
Ukraine. ‘‘He just loved Ukraine and his in-
terest in Ukraine and support for Ukraine
knew no bounds.’’ she said. Eppinger recalled
his experiment in taking up the Ukrainian
tradition of beekeeping. He installed bee-
hives in the backyard of the ambassador’s
residence. At a traditional Fourth of July re-
ception, she recalled that a colleague with
the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
‘‘got stung right on the nose’’ by a bee.
Miller joined the Foreign Service in 1959
and served a five-year assignment in Iran,
where he immersed himself in Persian cul-
ture. Farion said he never lost interest in
Iran. ‘‘He was instrumental in many infor-
mal talks between the US and Iran, trying to
find peace,’’ she said.
After his Iran assignment, Eppinger said
he returned to Washington, D.C., and quit
the Foreign Service over the Vietnam War
and got a job as a staff director of the U.S.
Senate Intelligence Committee.
‘‘He was part of the team that put together
the hearings on the U.S. intelligence services
attempted assassinations in the post-World
War II/Cold War era,’’ Eppinger said. ‘‘It was
thanks to those hearings and the report that
resulted that we got a revision to the execu-
tive order that sets the parameters to the in-
telligence community . . . that resulted in
the ban on assassinations by the U.S. intel-
ligence committee. He was sometimes criti-
cized as a romantic or idealist, but—as I
think the intelligence committee work
shows—he also had a canniness to thinking
about where a threat to democracy could
come from. and how to thwart it. I think
there was a hard practical streak in there
that often got overlooked.’’
According to a Eurasia Foundation biog-
raphy, Miller was educated at Williams Col-
lege, Oxford, and Harvard. After leaving his
Iran assignment in 1964, he returned to
Washington, D.C., as a line officer for U.S.
Secretary of State Dean Rusk. Miller then
went to work in the U.S. Senate in 1967,
where he served as foreign policy and defense
adviser to U.S. Senator John Sherman Coo-
per, a Republican who served Kentucky. In
1981 the U.S. Senate passed a special resolu-
tion commending Miller ‘‘for exceptional
contributions and for his dedication, loyalty,
integrity, and service.’’ Miller was associate
dean and professor of international politics
at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplo-
macy at Tufts University in Massachusetts
from 1981 to 1983.
In 1986, Miller returned to Washington as
president of the American Committee on
U.S.-Soviet Relations, traveling frequently
to the U.S.S.R. and living in Moscow from
1988 to 1993.
In retirement years, Miller was a senior
policy scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Inter-
national Center for Scholars in Washington,
D.C., a member of the Council on Foreign
Relations, the International Institute of
Strategic Studies and the Middle East Insti-
tute. He was also co-chairman of the Kyiv
Mohyla Foundation of America and a direc-
tor of the Andrei Sakharov Foundation as
well as a consultant for the John D. and
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.
Farion said a memorial service is being
planned at the National Cathedral in Wash-
ington, D.C., on Oct. 12 or 13, but that ar-
rangements are still being finalized.

COMMEMORATING THE
GROUNDBREAKING OF FORT
STREET BRIDGE PARK
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in
honor of the groundbreaking of Fort Street
Bridge Park in Detroit, Michigan.
Thanks to the hard work and advocacy of
community members, today we break ground
to build the Fort Street Bridge Park. This park
is the culmination of the efforts of environ-
mental activists, historians, and dedicated
neighbors who all fought for a vision of a
beautiful community green space for all to
enjoy.
Fort Street Bridge Park will be a jewel of our
community, a green oasis amongst the heavy
industry that lines this section of the Rouge
River. It will connect us to the water that has
been the lifeblood of our region, a constant re-
minder of our past and our future. The Park
will commemorate the 1932 Ford Hunger
March, where brave workers stood up to Ford,
demanded economic justice and fair working
conditions, and the police responded with gun-
fire, killing four people and played a key role
in ushering in the unionization of the auto in-
dustry.
This Park will not only be dedicated to con-
servation and education, but will also serve as
a reminder of the fragility of our natural re-
sources and public health if we do not do
what’s necessary to protect them. The Park
will occupy a significant space in history and
community, especially as it honors the late
Congressman John Dingell and his legacy of
environmental advocacy, which is so inter-
twined with the Rouge River.
Please join me in rising in tribute to Fort
Street Bridge Park.

RECOGNIZING GAIL FISHER FOR
WINNING THE U.S. ARMY MATE-
RIEL COMMAND PARALEGAL OF
THE YEAR AWARD
HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Gail Fisher for winning the U.S.
Army Materiel Command (AMC) Paralegal of
the Year Award. Ms. Fisher received the
award at the AMC Legal Conference held in
Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama in
August.
Gail Fisher was born and raised in Rock Is-
land, Illinois, and started working at the Rock
Island Arsenal in August 1981. She began as
a receptionist before working her way up to a
secretary and then a paralegal, after attending
Marycrest College in Davenport, Iowa. From
1999 to 2006, Ms. Fisher worked for the U.S.
Army Tank-Automotive & Armaments Com-
mand (TACOM) in Rock Island, while pursuing
a bachelor’s degree in business administration
from St. Ambrose University. After leaving
TACOM, she moved to her office in the AMC
Legal Center, where she has worked for the
past 31 years. Her award is well warranted.
Ms. Fisher is responsible for ensuring the as-
sembly of agency reports and administrative
records for federal court—confirming they are
accurately marked, indexed and uploaded and
transmitted in a timely manner. Her vast
knowledge of law and wide range of experi-
ence allow her to process and track numerous
cases at the same time. I commend Ms. Fish-
er for winning this prestigious award and thank
her for her service to the Rock Island Arsenal.
It is because of community leaders such as
Gail Fisher that I am especially proud to serve
Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam
Speaker, I would like to again formally con-
gratulate Gail Fisher for winning the pres-
tigious AMC Paralegal of the Year Award.

touring their farmland, I was impressed by the
Goldmon family’s dedication to agriculture,
family values, and quality products.
In addition to being recognized as the Farm
Family of the Year for the Southeast District,
Dell-Cam Farms has served as a model for
agricultural innovation for producers through-
out the United States. The title of Farm Family
of the Year serves to illustrate the Goldmon
family’s pursuit of effective and efficient farm-
ing technologies and practices.
I take this time to congratulate the
Goldmons on this tremendous honor and
thank them for their commitment to wise land
stewardship.
CONGRATULATING LOVE THY
BABY ON TWENTY YEARS OF
SERVICE
HON. KENNY MARCHANT
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Love Thy Baby on twen-
ty years of exemplary service to newborns and
their families in North Texas.
Love Thy Baby is a Dallas-area, non-profit
organization that provides support to families
of newborns experiencing an economic or
health crisis. By supplying blankets, quilts and
clothing to families in need, Love Thy Baby
helps to ensure a standard of comfort and
warmth for infants in our communities. The or-
ganization also coordinates monthly deliveries
to healthcare facilities such as Parkland Hos-
pital in Dallas, John Peter Smith Hospital in
Fort Worth, and PediPlace Pediatric Clinics,
among others.
On October 11, 1999, Patricia Clay-Jolly
created the Dallas Chapter of Newborns in
Need upon identifying a demand for warm
blankets, clothing, and other essentials for
newborn babies at Parkland Hospital. The or-
ganization would go on to provide tens of
thousands of items to newborns and their fam-
ilies. In January 2015, Newborns in Need inte-
grated into the organization, Love Thy Neigh-
bor, ultimately changing its name to ‘Love Thy
Baby’.
Today, Love Thy Baby has 120 active vol-
unteers and provides over 40,000 new items
every year. Furthermore, Love Thy Baby do-
nates over 10,000 gently used items to other
area nonprofits including Hope 4 Refugees,
Sharing Life, Nexus, Family Place, and White
Rock Center of Hope.
Madam Speaker, Love Thy Baby’s incred-
ible contributions to the newborn children of
North Texas has had an immeasurable impact
on the lives of so many North Texas families.
Such an accomplishment should not go with-
out recognition and I ask all my distinguished
colleagues to join me in thanking Love Thy
Baby for their twenty years of service.

tion Medal with Combat V. He medically re-
tired to Texas with his wife Christina and their
three children.
In 2005, Felix joined MOPH Chapter 493 in
Vista, California where he quickly rose through
the ranks to become Senior Vice Commander.
He went on to found MOPH Chapter 808 in
Palm Coast, Florida, where he led its mem-
bers in installing the Purple Heart Monument
in Hero’s Park.
Felix moved to Texas in 2012, where he
joined his current MOPH chapter, Chapter
723, and served as its commander for three
terms of office. He grew the chapter by recruit-
ing younger award recipients who served in
Afghanistan and Iraq.
Felix was recently elected to become the
new National Commander of the MOPH. I had
the honor of working with him on my Veterans’
Advisory Board, where he played an integral
role.
I am proud to see Felix ascend into his new
position and I am confident the MOPH is in
great hands. Congratulations to Felix and God
bless all of our Purple Heart veterans.

IN RECOGNITION OF PAQUETTA
PALMER FOR A DISTINGUISHED
CAREER IN ACTIVISM, SOCIAL
JUSTICE, AND COMMUNITY
HEALTH
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Paquetta Palmer on her
retirement from Community Public Health and
recognize her years of distinguished service.
Her contributions to the community are worthy
of commendation.
Paquetta Palmer’s work at Washtenaw
County’s Community Mental Health has been
paramount in addressing our community’s
mental health needs. As a Customer Re-
source Specialist, Palmer provided mental
health services to people with mental ill-
nesses, emotional disturbances, and develop-
mental disabilities, giving them the tools nec-
essary to work through their struggles. Palmer
is known among her colleagues for her high
degree of professionalism, kind demeanor,
and passion for helping others.
Paquetta Palmer’s commitment to serving
Washtenaw County extends far beyond her
professional work. Palmer has used the bulk
of her free time working tirelessly with a vari-
ety of organizations to advance racial, eco-
nomic, and social justice for all within the com-
munity. Palmer is a volunteer cook at Food
Gatherers and participates in Neutral Zone, an
organization dedicated to promoting the per-
sonal growth of our community’s youth. Fur-
thermore, Palmer has been an informal Health
and Human Services advocate, a longtime
community advocate for affordable housing in
Washtenaw County, and even was a pioneer
in comprehensive healthcare reform for low-in-
come residents, fighting for the adoption of the
Washtenaw County Health Plan long before
the Affordable Care Act was even imple-
mented. Palmer’s steadfast dedication to sup-
porting the entire community is truly remark-
able.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in celebrating Paquetta Palmer’s retire-
ment. Over her decades of service, Palmer
has become a pillar of the Washtenaw County
community, and it is my honor and privilege to
recognize her dedication today. We are grate-
ful for her outstanding work and wish her the
best of luck in her future endeavors.

INTRODUCTION OF WATER SUPPLY
INFRASTRUCTURE AND REHA-
BILITATION ACT
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE
OF WASHINGTON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to introduce the Water Supply Infrastruc-
ture and Rehabilitation Act. This legislation will
help address the need for the new storage,
conveyance, and recycling projects necessary
to increase our drought resilience and provide
the water security required to meet the needs
of our agricultural economy and our local com-
munities.
As a farmer, former state Director of Agri-
culture, and now a Congressman representing
one of the most flourishing agricultural regions
in America, I fully understand how important it
is that we reinvest in the water infrastructure
our farms and communities were built upon—
much of which is over a century old at this
point. I have made it a priority to address
these important issues for Central Wash-
ington, and for rural communities across the
West, that have Bureau of Reclamation
projects in their regions.
That is why I am introducing this legisla-
tion—to help local water managers access the
funds they need to repair and rebuild aging fa-
cilities and ensure our existing surface storage
facilities are operating as efficiently as pos-
sible.
The Water Supply Infrastructure Rehabilita-
tion and Utilization Act addresses the Bureau
of Reclamation’s (BOR) maintenance backlog
at water supply infrastructure projects. Since
1902, BOR has constructed dams, hydro-
power plants, canals, and irrigation convey-
ances to provide for our water needs. Far too
much of this infrastructure is in serious need
of maintenance and repair. My legislation cre-
ates a streamlined process, so local water op-
erators can initiate maintenance projects with
extended repayment through a much more
clearly-defined application and review process.
Local users need this flexibility to access
these resources—this bill will help them do
just that.
Earlier this year, Central Washington
crossed one of the most significant hurdles for
water needs in our region when President
Trump signed my legislation into law author-
izing the next phase of the Yakima Project. It
was a momentous occasion and a testament
to the many collaborative efforts and stake-
holders in the Yakima Valley. But as many of
us know, authorization is only the key first
step.
Next comes—what some would say is—the
even more difficult part: securing the re-
sources and the funding to actually implement
those projects authorized. I have been working
on the Yakima Project for much of my career,
and this bill will create an easier, more-
streamlined process to access the funds for
this desperately needed infrastructure in Cen-
tral Washington.
This legislation also strengthens the ‘‘Safety
of Dams’’ program to improve structural integ-
rity of dams across the U.S. In Central Wash-
ington, we are no stranger to the benefits
dams provide for irrigation districts and the ag-
ricultural industry. Like much of our nation’s in-
frastructure, dams are aging and require reg-
ular maintenance and upkeep. The ‘‘Safety of
Dams’’ program is important for ensuring all
BOR dams across the country continue to op-
erate safely and efficiently—from the Grand
Coulee Dam down to the Sunnyside, Prosser,
and Roza Diversion dams. The Yakima
Project alone has five storage dam and res-
ervoirs, including Bumping Lake, Clear Creek,
Tieton, Cle Elum, Kachess, and Keechelus.
Washington’s 4th District truly is at the epi-
center of need for ensuring the stability of
BOR dam infrastructure, and this program is
responsible for funding any updates or mainte-
nance to these dams. However, BOR expects
to reach their current statutory cap on the pro-
gram in the next two years. My bill will in-
crease the authorization of this program to
meet BOR’s projected funding needs for the
future workload to ensure water users in re-
gions like Central Washington can continue to
enjoy the benefits of dams, large and small,
that all make our way of life possible.
Finally, the legislation creates a pilot pro-
gram to give more flexibility to reservoir opera-
tors. Communities across the West know the
impacts of droughts all too well. This bill al-
lows local operators to temporarily store water
in dedicated flood control space during certain
low-risk times of the year. By addressing the
maintenance backlog at our water supply
projects, strengthening the structural integrity
of our water infrastructure, and providing flexi-
bility for water storage to best equip our com-
munities in times of drought, we can secure
the resources required to address the current
and future water needs for the Yakima Valley
and for water needs across the West. I en-
courage all of my colleagues to support the
Water Supply Infrastructure and Rehabilitation
Act. I look forward to pushing for its passage
here in the House and for its companion legis-
lation, led by Senator MARTHA MCSALLY, in the
United States Senate.

Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
celebrate Mr. Mesik Abajian, who passed
away on Thursday, September 27, 2019 at the
age of 97. Mesik will be remembered for his
service to our country and contributions to the
community.
Mesik was born to Salve and Nishon
Abajian in Selma, California on May 31, 1922.
He was raised in Selma and graduated high
school in 1941. Mesik joined the United States
Army Air Corps and served courageously in
World War II. Upon his return from service, he
married the love of his life Peggy Emerzian in
1946.
Peggy and Mesik began farming in Selma
on their Bethel Avenue ranch and together
raised two daughters, Wendy and Shelly.
Mesik was passionate about farming and lived
on the family’s farm until his passing. Mesik
was married to Peggy for 61 years until her
passing in 2007.
Mesik is preceded in death by his parents
Nishon and Salve Abajian, brother Seth
Abajian and his wife Ruby Abajian, sister
Anna Abajian, brother-in-law Manuel Kay
Emerzian, and wife Peggy Abajian. He is sur-
vived by his daughters, Wendy and Shelly,
and his many nieces and nephews.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring the life and service of my
friend Mesik Abajian. He was a respected man
of the Central Valley and his community.
CELEBRATING THE DEDICATION

MONUMENT
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I would
like to take this opportunity to celebrate the
unveiling of the Virginia Women’s Monument
in Richmond, Virginia.
I would like to recognize the Virginia Council
on Women for hosting the unveiling of this
groundbreaking monument, the first-of-its-kind
in the country to be erected on State Capitol
grounds. The Virginia Women’s Monument ac-
knowledges the profound achievements and
lasting legacies of extraordinary women who
have lived and worked in Virginia.
The monument honors over four hundred
years of women’s history through twelve his-
toric Virginia women: Anne Burras Laydon,
Cockacoeske, Mary Draper Ingles, Martha
Washington, Clementina Rind, Elizabeth
Keckley, Sally L. Tompkins, Maggie L. Walker,
Sarah G. Jones, Laura S. Copenhaver, Vir-
ginia E. Randolph, and Adèle Clark.
These women made significant strides for
the betterment of our Commonwealth and our
country. Their distinct accomplishments range
across various fields, such as business, bank-
ing, arts, politics, medicine, and social justice.
These women deserve a prominent platform
and our nation’s attention, and I am honored
to recognize them.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in recognizing these distinguished women
and honoring their memories through the dedi-
cation of the Virginia Women’s Monument.

INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL
COMMISSION TO COMBAT WORK-
PLACE SEXUAL HARASSMENT
ACT
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the National Commission to Combat
Workplace Sexual Harassment Act to estab-
lish a national commission to examine and
combat sexual harassment in the U.S. work-
place.
I have modeled this bill on legislation Con-
gress has passed to address other national
problems considered to be serious, such as
gambling. The almost daily exposure of allega-
tions of sexual harassment, many not denied,
more than qualifies sexual harassment for na-
tional attention and priority. This bill would cre-
ate a national commission to focus on sexual
harassment in major industries and work-
places throughout the United States.
Congress recently adopted a bill that ad-
dresses harassment in the congressional
workplace. It requires Members of the House
and Senate to be personally liable for settle-
ments and awards resulting from harassment
and retaliation claims, removes the mandatory
counseling, mediation and ‘‘cooling off’’ peri-
ods for accusers that is currently required,
mandates publicly reporting awards and settle-
ments and covers unpaid staff as well. This is
a step in the right direction beginning where
Congress should—right here in the Congress
itself. However, nothing equivalent has been
done for sexual harassment that affects the
American people. We have largely neglected
our own constituents, despite the increasing
number of troubling reports in the news of
sexual harassment claims.
A national commission would assure the
American people that Congress takes sexual
harassment affecting them—the typical work-
er—seriously, beyond the high-profile exam-
ples, such as allegations against Harvey
Weinstein, Jeffrey Epstein and the Congress
itself, that have garnered the headlines. Most
importantly, the commission would hear from a
cross section of the public—from office and
factory workers to retail and food service em-
ployees—whose experiences with sexual har-
assment have received almost no national at-
tention. The commission could travel or invite
witnesses to Washington from throughout the
country to recommend changes in laws or reg-
ulations and best practices on preventing,
training, investigating, responding to and pe-
nalizing sexual harassment in the private and
public sectors.
Our constituents expect Congress, which
represents every sector, to take on the prob-
lem of sexual harassment throughout our na-
tional economy, including private and public
(federal, state and local) workplaces. A na-
tional commission could help reach and re-
duce sexual harassment, a form of gender dis-
crimination, where the average American
works.
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this
bill.

National Lakeshore for welcoming its 50 mil-
lionth visitor. Through a commitment to con-
serving this natural treasure and ensuring it
can be enjoyed by visitors from throughout the
world, the Sleeping Bear Dunes has become
an indispensable part of Northern Michigan.
Our state is home to some of the most
beautiful natural wonders in the country—at-
tracting visitors from around the world and
providing Michiganders with a quality of life
that is second to none. Perhaps first among
these picturesque landscapes is the Sleeping
Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Located in
the northwest corner of the Lower Peninsula,
the Sleeping Bear Dunes covers a 35-mile
stretch of Lake Michigan’s coastline. Its bluffs,
forests, beaches, inland lakes, and unique
wildlife have been enjoyed by locals and visi-
tors for centuries. The land was established as
a National Lakeshore under the National
Parks Service in October of 1970—and over
the next 49 years, millions would come to
enjoy everything it has to offer. On August 19,
2019, the National Lakeshore welcomed its 50
millionth visitor. This incredible milestone,
coming at the cusp of its 50th anniversary,
clearly shows how dearly the Sleeping Bear
Dunes are held in the hearts of Michiganders
and all Americans.
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize
the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore
for welcoming its 50 millionth visitor.
Michiganders can take immense pride in
knowing that the First District is home to such
an important and beloved natural treasure.

work is worthy of commendation.
Established by the students at the University
of Michigan in 2017, Express, Fulfill, Prosper
(EFP) is a voluntary organization committed to
supporting anyone in need of assistance, es-
pecially those struggling with mental health
issues. The volunteers of EFP strive to help
people feel acknowledged and offer them the
opportunity to talk through their thoughts,
emotions, and behaviors, allowing them to feel
supported by the community around them.
Members of the organization work on campus,
in hospitals and schools, and throughout the
local Ann Arbor Community to uplift others
while simultaneously developing their own val-
uable leadership skills. Through the organiza-
tion’s efforts, EFP hopes their members’ work
will encourage individuals to express them-
selves, fulfill their goals, and prosper.
Social and fundraising events are essential
to EFP’s success in aiding others. Thus,
EFP’s First Annual Fundraising Dinner for
Mental Health Awareness demonstrates the
organization’s unrelenting commitment to sup-
porting those struggling with mental health
issues. Hosted during the week of world men-
tal health awareness, this inaugural event will
generate greater awareness about mental
health and begin to challenge the troubling
stigmas associated with it. I am proud of
EFP’s commitment to mental health and I am
very excited for the future dinners to come.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring EFP and celebrate their First

recognition of the 60th birthday of Arbetter Hot

Arbetter’s experience with Italian cuisine and
Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Arbetter’s memories of eating
hot dogs at Fenway Park in Boston during his

Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to rejoice the birth of Afton Margaret,
daughter to Lauren and Tyler Jones. Born on
Wednesday, October 9th at seven pounds and
15 ounces, she is the greatest God given gift
anyone would be lucky to receive. There is no
stronger love than that of a parent for their
child, and I couldn’t think of two more perfect
people to raise a kind, brave, and intelligent
person in this world than these two.
Tyler and Lauren have been with me from
day one. Tyler has been an amazing col-
league, confidante, and most importantly, a re-
markable friend. We have seen ups, and we
surely saw downs, but I have found a loyalty
and friendship in Tyler that I know he and
Lauren will instill in their very own daughter’s
values, And Lauren has proved to have the
same grace and strength I found in my wife,
as her husband and I learned how to win over
the Lowcountry we all four deeply love.
If y’all thought my campaign was tough, wel-
come to parenting. I cannot wait to see the
beautiful journey that unfolds. Amanda,
Boone, Teddy and I are here for anything that
you two, Afton, and Leia will ever need.
We love y’all, good luck and congratula-
tions.

Mr. Duerod began his sports career when
he joined Highland Park High School’s basket-
ball team. He excelled at the sport and
brought athletic prestige to the program by

ships. Mr. Duerod continued to play basketball
after high school at University of Detroit before
moving on to a career in professional basket-
ball, first playing for the Detroit Pistons and
the Dallas Mavericks before finally landing a
spot on the Boston Celtics. As a Boston Celt-
ic, Mr. Duerod was voted a fan favorite and
earned a championship ring in the 1981 Na-
tional Basketball Association Finals. For his ef-
forts and outstanding performance, he was in-
ducted into the University of Detroit’s Hall of
Fame and has only continued to serve his
community. Following his athletic career, Mr.
Duerod switched gears to public service and
has worked tirelessly as a Detroit firefighter,
where he continued to play basketball with the
Detroit Fire Department’s team. Since retiring,
he still finds time to impact the lives of others
through basketball.
Throughout his life, Mr. Duerod has rep-
resented the cities of Highland Park and De-
troit with astounding spirit, serving as an inspi-
ration to others. Please join me in recognizing
Terry Duerod.

CONGRATULATING MR. STANLEY
BALZEKAS FOR HIS LEADERSHIP
AND DISTINGUISHED SERVICE
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Mr. Stanley Balzekas who has been
awarded the title and badge of an Honorable
Nobleman by the Lithuanian Royal Society of
Nobility.
Mr. Balzekas has dedicated his life to pre-
serving and spreading Lithuanian history and
culture. In 1966, Mr. Balzekas founded the
Balzekas Museum of Lithuanian Culture in
Chicago. Through his dedicated leadership,
the museum has grown to become the largest
repository of Lithuanian cultural artifacts out-
side of Lithuania. Mr. Balzekas’s tireless work
has enhanced America’s understanding of
Lithuanian history and enriched the culture of
the Chicagoland community.
Mr. Balzekas is also an American patriot,
having proudly served in the United States
Army during World War II. He bravely fought
in the Battle of the Hurtgen Forest, one of the
longest and fiercest battles in Europe. For he-
roically risking his life to rescue twelve wound-
ed soldiers, Mr. Balzekas was awarded the
Bronze Star as well as the Purple Heart.
To recognize Mr. Balzekas’s noble lineage
and his contributions to Lithuanian culture, the
Lithuanian Royal Society of Nobility conferred
to him a title of nobility in his absence. The
title was conferred in Vilnius, Lithuania, on
July 7, 2019, the anniversary of the crowning
of King Mindaugas. The Lithuanian Royal So-
ciety of Nobility strives to safeguard the tradi-
tions of the Lithuanian nation and revive the
spirit of the ancient Lithuanians. The nobility
award will be personally presented to Mr.
Balzekas at an event in his honor in Chicago
on October 11.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in congratulating Mr. Stanley Balzekas on
this tremendous honor. He deserves praise for
the energy and time he has dedicated to pre-
serving Lithuanian culture, as well as serving
his community and country. I thank him for his
service and wish him and his family the best.

IN RECOGNITION OF MARGARET
‘‘MARDEE’’ XIFARAS
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker. I rise today
in recognition of the life of Margaret ‘‘MarDee’’
Xifaras, a passionate political activist, suc-
cessful lawyer, and a beloved member of the
community on the South Coast of Massachu-
setts.
Born in Winnetka, Illinois, MarDee first came
to Massachusetts to earn her master’s degree
at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy
at Tufts University in Medford. Shortly after
graduating, MarDee moved to New Bedford to
help run Congressman Gerry E. Studds’ first
campaign for Congress. Though that first cam-
paign was not successful, MarDec had never-
theless found her new home. It was there that
she would meet her future husband or forty-
eight years, John Xifaras.
Continuing her education, MarDee earned a
second master’s degree at the former South-
eastern Massachusetts University in Dart-
mouth and a law degree at Boston University.
Soon after, she worked as an assistant district
attorney, a special assistant to Governor Mi-
chael Dukakis, and later became a partner at
the New Bedford law firm of Lang, Xifaras and
Bullard.
With the desire to do more, MarDee worked
tirelessly for the presidential campaigns of Ted
Kennedy, Michael Dukakis, Bill Clinton, Al
Gore, John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary
Clinton, in many instances uprooting herself
and moving to where she was needed most.
A nearly fifty year member of the Massachu-
setts Democratic State Committee, her years
of service to the party were deservedly recog-
nized when MarDee was elected to the Demo-
cratic National Committee by her peers.
Possibly MarDee’s greatest accomplish-
ment, however, was the role she played in
creation of the University of Massachusetts
Law School. Recognizing the need for a public
law school in Massachusetts, MarDee fought
against private interests to ensure the school’s
opening. Later she would sit on the board of
trustees, working tirelessly to guarantee that
its commitment to the community was fulfilled.
MarDee left us too soon on October 8th,
2019, at the age of seventy-four after a long
battle with breast cancer. She was an inspira-
tion to all that met her and a mentor to many.
MarDee would talk to Presidents or someone
in need with the same respect and dignity.
She will long be remembered far and wide for
her dedication to her community and her de-
sire to make the world a better place. In addi-
tion to her husband John, MarDee is survived
by her children Dena, Juliet, Michael, her two
brothers John and Jim, and six grandchildren.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor the
life of Margaret ‘‘MarDee’’ Xifaras. I ask that
my colleagues join me in recognizing her
many years of dedication to her community.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE MICHI-
GAN MUSLIM COMMUNITY COUN-
CIL
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the Michigan Muslim Com-
munity Council. Its meaningful work across the
state is worthy of commendation.
The Muslim community is an important com-
ponent of Michigan’s identity. Since the com-
munity’s humble beginnings in the state over
100 years ago, the Muslim community in
Michigan has grown significantly and today
represents one of the most diverse groups in
the nation. Seeing a need for greater unifica-
tion among the smaller communities divided
by Muslim sects, ethnicities, and races, the
Michigan Muslim Community Council (MMCC)
was established in 2012 through the merger of
two other Muslim organizations, the Council of
Islamic Organization of Michigan and the Is-
lamic Shura Council of Michigan. Since its in-
ception as a new, consolidated organization,
MMCC has worked tirelessly to promote unity

and cooperation by mobilizing the entire Mus-
lim community statewide. Together as one
voice, the council strives to purse social jus-
tice, improve human relationships, and uphold
human rights for all.
The Michigan Muslim Community Council’s
33rd Annual Unity Banquet exemplifies the
council’s continued commitment to unifying,
coordinating, and empowering Muslim commu-
nities across the state. Like the name sug-
gests, the MMCC Unity Banquet brings count-
less community members together to honor
our state’s diverse Muslim communities every
year. In addition, the banquet serves as a
great opportunity to celebrate the impactful
work of notable community figures who strive
for unity throughout our state’s vibrant and di-
verse Muslim communities every day.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring the Michigan Muslim Commu-
nity Council and celebrate their 33rd Annual
Unity Banquet. We are grateful for the coun-
cil’s dedicated efforts to unite Muslim commu-
nities and promote social justice across our
state.

RECOGNIZING THE KIWANIS CLUB
OF ROCK ISLAND, ILLINOIS FOR
ITS 100TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the Kiwanis Club of Rock Island,
Illinois for its 100th Anniversary. The club’s
rich history has been the cumulative effort of
its members coming from fields such as ac-
counting, civil service, education, manage-
ment, retail stores, retirees and many more.
Founded in 1919, the Kiwanis Club of Rock
Island began with 50 charter members and
has grown to its current membership to nearly
100. Throughout the years, the Kiwanis held
numerous fundraisers, including pancake
breakfasts, spaghetti suppers, peanut days,
rose days, bags tournaments, and more. They
are committed to serving the community
through their support of service leadership
programs throughout the schools in Rock Is-
land. The Kiwanis have also cleaned up high-
ways, aided with numerous community events
and have raised money to benefit children and
children’s support groups across our commu-
nity. In addition, they provide scholarships to
outstanding graduation seniors of Alleman and
Rock Island High School. Their impact is out-
standing. I want to thank and commend the
Kiwanis Club for its extraordinary service to
the Rock Island community.
It is because of the community leaders at
the Kiwanis Club in Rock Island, Illinois that I
am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th
Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I
would like to again formally congratulate the
Kiwanis Club of Rock Island for its 100th Anni-
versary.
IN HONOR OF ARCHBISHOP MARY
FLOYD PALMER
HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Arch-
bishop Mary Floyd Palmer, the first female Af-
rican-American Archbishop in America and
presiding prelate of the Philadelphia Council of
Clergy. She has—and continues to be—a vital
part of the Philadelphia community, where she
carries out her life mission of helping and min-
istering those in need.
As a native of my district, Archbishop Floyd
Palmer is the eldest daughter of Rev. Dr. Mel-
vin Floyd and has been serving her commu-
nity since childhood. She began her career in
full time ministry as a Motivational Speaker
and soon became Confidante and Counselor
to Pastors, their wives, and Episcopal leaders
from all around the world.
She continued to be a positive influence in
Philadelphia by ministering in federal, state,
and county prisons, half-way houses, nursing
homes, and youth centers. Her commitment
led to her appointment as the Pennsylvania
Re-entry Council, which focused on reducing
recidivism rates. Archbishop Palmer soon be-
came the founder and Pastor of the Samaritan
Temple.
Her dedication has been recognized by the
Philadelphia Chapter of the National Congress
of Black Women and she was named their
‘‘Women of the Year in Ministry.’’ She also re-
ceived the Lucien E. Blackwell Guiding Light
Community Award. Moreover, Archbishop
Floyd Palmer hosts an award-winning, weekly
radio show called the ‘‘The Bishop Mary
Show’’ to connect with national, and even
international, listeners. In March 2019, she
made history by becoming the first female Afri-
can American Archbishop in America.
Philadelphia is extremely lucky to have
someone like Archbishop Floyd Palmer to en-
rich our community. There is no doubt she has
positively impacted many lives, and I am cer-
tain more lives will be impacted by her serv-
ice.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the work of the ministers, pastors,
and priests in my district for Clergy Apprecia-
tion Day. Also known as National Pastor Day,
this annual celebration falls on the second
Sunday of each October. On this day, con-

clergy and take up special offerings to bless
them.
Members of the clergy provide their con-
gregations spiritual guidance with words of
wisdom, healing, and inspiration. But they also
serve their larger communities, especially
those of us who find ourselves most in need.
It is an honor to recognize their leadership in
promoting our shared values of love, service,
and community.
I ask that all my colleagues join me today in
thanking the members of the clergy in your
districts for the selfless work they do. I look

eryone in our community.

Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
celebrate Mr. Raymond ‘‘Ray’’ Ensher, who
passed away on Friday, September 27, 2019
at the age of 85. Ray will be remembered for
his dedicated service to the community of
Fresno, California.
Ray was born on September 26, 1934 in
Fresno. He graduated from California State

ing as a high school drama teacher at the

tions and the Mickey Matheson Award for Ad-
vocacy from the California Retired Teachers

Joaquin Valley, and recipient of the Fresno
County Democratic Party’s Democrat of the
Year award in 2012. He was a member of the
Fresno County Democratic Women’s Club,
serving as diversity chair and past president.
He would passionately write to the Fresno Bee

talents from an early age. She pursued those
talents and studied commercial design in her
country of birth while continuing to make art.
Sulin eventually moved to Hawaii for two
decades, where she learned how to make
three-dimensional floral designs out of clay.
Her ceramic flowers were a hit and soon she
was setting up shop at shows to sell her
works of art.
Ms. Sue moved to Sugar Land in 2015
where she began teaching art at schools be-
fore opening up her own studio where she has
had immense success privately instructing stu-
dents. Three of Sulin’s students were among
the 40 winners selected from over 3,900 sub-
missions in the 2019 Treasures of the Texas
Coast Children’s Art Contest.
Sulin embodies what it truly means to be an
educator. She fosters creativity and love for
the work that she and her students do and is
a stellar example of the inspirational power
that teachers have.
On behalf of the Twenty-Second District of
Texas, I thank Sulin Huang for inspiring so
many with her art.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE YEMEN
AMERICAN BENEVOLENT ASSO-
CIATION
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the 50th anniversary of the
Yemen American Benevolent Association. Its
meaningful work in Michigan is worthy of com-
mendation.
Established in 1969, the Yemen American
Benevolent Association (YABA) was created
to support targeted communities. YABA en-
deavored to strengthen families, grow a sus-
tainable regional economy, promote environ-
mental protections, cultivate leadership, and
encourage mutual respect for all. Since its in-
ception, YABA has been dedicated to its mis-
sion and offers services like immigration as-
sistance, Arabic language classes, fax serv-
ices, and tutoring, to name a few, to achieve
its goals. The association’s efforts truly make
a difference and positively impact the commu-
nities it serves.
The Yemen American Benevolent Associa-
tion has been a valued part of our Michigan
community for half a century. Although
YABA’s dedicated work continues to uplift tar-
geted communities across Michigan, the asso-
ciation especially supports Dearborn and ad-
dresses the community’s changing needs.
Through its efforts to create links between
people and the services they require, YABA
has helped the Yemeni-Arab-American com-
munity in Dearborn thrive. YABA’s wide range
services prove to be an indispensable re-
source for many, and I deeply appreciate the
association’s tremendous work in our commu-
nity.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring the 50th anniversary of the
Yemen American Benevolent Association. For
half a century, YABA has been an essential
part of our Yemeni-American community. We
are grateful for its impact and wish it contin-
ued success ahead.

HONORING THE LIFE OF COLO-
RADO SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE
RUBEN VALDEZ
HON. JOE NEGUSE
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, today I
stand with the State of Colorado in mourning
the loss of an historic and iconic public serv-
ant—Colorado Speaker of the House Ruben
Valdez.
Born in Trinidad, Colorado, Speaker Valdez
left school at the age of 15 to find work and
support his mother and family. He later re-
ceived his high school diploma through a GED
program and used this experience to motivate
his passion for expanding education opportuni-
ties to all Coloradans.
Early in his career, Speaker Valdez joined
the United Steelworkers of America and rose
through the union ranks. He eventually be-
came the President of Steelworkers Local
5099 in Denver where he fought alongside his
fellow union members for countless protec-
tions for workers throughout Colorado and the
United States.
Speaker Valdez was elected to the Colo-
rado House of Representatives in 1970, rep-
resenting west and southwest Denver. In
1975, he became House speaker, Colorado’s
first Latino Speaker. Throughout his time in
the State Legislature, Speaker Valdez was a
strong advocate for workers, consumer protec-
tions and equity in education.
Speaker Valdez’s involvement in politics re-
mained constant throughout his life, even fol-
lowing his historic Speakership. Amongst
many accomplishments, he served as a Re-
gional Director of the U.S. Department of
Transportation under President Jimmy Carter
and worked as Executive Director of Colo-
rado’s Department of Social Services and De-
partment of Labor and Employment. In his
later years, he worked alongside his grand-
daughter as a lobbyist in the State Capitol,
continuously pushing the legislative body to-
ward justice and equity.
Throughout his many years of service,
Speaker Valdez created a legacy of which his
family, friends, and supporters should be so
proud. It is a legacy that will no doubt continue
to influence lawmakers and Coloradans alike,
for generations to come.
For me, Speaker Valdez was a personal
hero whose commitment to our state and to
justice in our legislative process we can only
hope to emulate. I join my Colorado commu-
nity in mourning the loss of this thoughtful and
empathetic leader, and send my deepest con-
dolences to his entire family.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF DR.
ROSA SLADE GRAGG
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
pay tribute to the memory of Dr. Rosa Slade
Gragg, a woman who represented and cham-
pioned the civil rights of Black women of the
City of Detroit.
Dr. Rosa Slade Gragg worked as an English
teacher before she became involved with civil
rights advocacy. She quickly became an out-
standing advocate for the advancement of
Black women’s rights. She was eventually ap-
pointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to
serve on the Board of the National Volunteer’s
Participation Committee of Civil Defense. Dr.
Gragg also worked alongside Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr. as an active and vocal champion
of the civil rights movement. In addition to her
advocacy, Dr. Gragg founded the Slade-Gragg
Academy of Practical Arts in 1947, the first
Black vocational school in Detroit. More than
two thousand women and returning veterans
were trained at the academy, the first Black
owned and operated business on Woodward
Avenue in Detroit. Over the years, Dr. Gragg
accumulated a number of honors and recogni-
tion for her work to advance civil rights and
served as an advisor to three United States
Presidents.
We owe a debt of gratitude for the hard
work and dedication of Dr. Rosa Slade Gragg.
It is with great honor that I ask my colleagues
to join with me in honor of her memory and
upon the dedication of a street named to ac-
knowledge her civil rights activism.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF MOUNT MORIAH
BAPTIST CHURCH
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR.
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I join the
community of Mount Moriah Baptist Church in
the Cliffwood section of Aberdeen, New Jer-
sey in recognizing the 100th anniversary of
the church. Through its long history, Mount
Moriah Baptist Church has provided a spiritual
center for prayer and fellowship to the commu-
nity.
The church property was purchased from
Gelhaus White and Charles H. White in 1914
and deeded in 1919. While the church mem-
bers worked on raising money to erect the
building, they held services in each other’s
homes. The church, originally named Mount
Moriah Missionary Baptist Church, was led at
the time by Reverend J.W. Coakly and five
additional trustees, T.M. Lester, Joseph Boles,
Bearl Smith, Fred Coakly and Edward D.
Causy.
Today, Mount Moriah Baptist Church re-
mains a close-knit congregation. Its 60 mem-
bers are led by Pastor Eddie Aikens and
board members Deacon Marvin Fisher, Trust-
ee Deputy Maor Robert Swindle, Financial
Secretary Van Lane and Treasurer Betty Dun-
can. Throughout its long history, the church’s
spiritual leaders, Board of Trustees, staff and
members have endeavored to carry on its mis-
sion of faith and service.
Madam Speaker, once again, it is my great
honor to pay tribute to Mount Moriah Baptist
Church as it celebrates its 100th anniversary
this year. This incredible milestone is truly de-
serving of this body’s recognition.

RECOGNIZING THE CENTENNIAL
OF VERO BEACH
HON. BILL POSEY
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, October 2019
marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of
Vero Beach, an iconic and vibrant seaside
town full of rich history and culture in my dis-
trict that I am proud to celebrate. Known lo-
cally as the ‘‘Hidden Jewel of the Treasure
Coast’’, Vero Beach continues to showcase
the unique wildlife, scenic coasts, thriving local
businesses and the hardworking people of
Florida.
First settled in the 1800’s, Vero Beach’s
original pioneers paved the way for the pros-
perity the city enjoys today. One of the most
notable early settlers, Henry T. Gifford, owned
and operated a citrus grove business in addi-
tion to establishing the area’s first mercantile
store that doubled as a post office, express of-
fice and railroad ticket office. The story of how
the town got its name ‘‘Vero’’ is often attrib-
uted to his wife Sarah who suggested the set-
tlement be named the Latin word for ‘‘to speak
the truth.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1279
October 11, 2019
The Giffords’ entrepreneurial spirit lived on,
then leading Vero to experience significant
growth and expansion in the following dec-
ades. In 1893, Henry Flaglers Florida East
Coast Railroad (FEC) began service through
Indian River County, serving as a turning point
for the growing settlement that led to the In-
dian River Farms Company’s launch of an ex-
tensive land reclamation project. This included
a vision for a town that would become ‘‘one of
the finest in Florida.’’ The final plans for the
‘‘Town of Vero’’ were adopted in 1913. In
1925, following Vero’s incorporation into the
City Beautiful Campaign, the town’s most
prominent members lobbied the Florida Legis-
lature for the creation of a new county known
as ‘‘Indian River.’’ Vero was designated the
county seat and was re-named Vero Beach.
Just recently, the city officials of Vero Beach
gathered in recognition of the Centennial with
an official proclamation. The Mayor of Vero
Beach, Val Zudans says of the milestone,
‘‘There is no better small town in America to
live, retire, visit, raise children, or start a busi-
ness. At 100 we are proud of our heritage,
culture, and freedom. We eagerly await the
next 100 years of making Vero more Vero.’’
In 2018, Vero was named one of the ‘‘Top
Ten Happiest Seaside Towns in America’’ by
Coastal Living Magazine, and it continues to
stand as a beautiful and lively back drop for
families looking for a place to settle and for
veterans seeking retirement. Its residents led
by the Vero Beach Centennial Committee, in-
tend to celebrate the 100 years with a month-
long celebration of the community that in-
cludes a historic slide show and video presen-
tation, live music, and a parade by Vero
Beach High School.
I ask my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing the Centennial of Vero Beach. Here’s to
100 more years of memories and community.

RECOGNIZING MAYOR ARTHUR
HOLK ON HIS 94TH BIRTHDAY
HON. BRADLEY BYRNE
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. BYRNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize Mayor Arthur Holk upon his 94th
birthday.
Arthur has a decorated career as a public
servant that began in 1952.
Arthur served as the mayor of Foley from
1976 to 1996 after serving on the Foley City
Council for 24 years.
While Mayor, Arthur was elected President
of the Alabama League of Municipalities,
President of the Alabama League of Municipal
Insurance Corporation, and Chairman of the
State of Alabama Aeronautics Commission.
Outside of office, he remained an engaged
leader in his community.
During Arthur’s long tenure in public office,
Alabama incredibly had nine different gov-
ernors.
Outside of public office, Arthur served his
hometown as an insurance agent for over 60
years with State Farm Insurance and Baldwin
Mutual Insurance.
Arthur is a 1949 graduate of Auburn Univer-
sity. He and his late wife, Fannie Jo, had two
children, Frances and Andy. Their children
and grandchildren have continued Arthur’s leg-
acy of community service and civic involve-
ment.
I congratulate Mayor Holk, on his 94th birth-
day, and thank Kim for all he has done for
Southwest Alabama.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MICHAEL
ANTHONY OVIEDO
HON. PETE OLSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to commend the life-giving choice made by
Mike Oviedo.
In August, Mike, a lively, jovial 21-year-old
from Katy, Texas passed away suddenly from
an asthma attack.
A child of a military family, Mike embodied
the value of service and worked hard to make
others happy. He enjoyed spending time with
his family and friends and was a hard worker
who took immense pride in his job at Gorman
Uniform.
Mike continued exemplifying the value of
service even in death by making the magnani-
mous decision to donate his organs.
Organ donors are some of the most selfless
and honorable people, giving up their own
bodies after dying to ensure that others can
live happier, healthier and longer lives. People
like Mike demonstrate what it truly means to
give.
Mike’s memory will forever live on in the
hearts and minds of his family, friends and
community. And now, his big heart will con-
tinue to beat on, imparting onto someone the
greatest gift of all: life.
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-
sional District of Texas, I would like to com-
memorate Mike’s memory, his selfless gift and
the wonderful legacy he has left to his family
and our community.

FIRE OPERATIONS CHIEF MARK
BURNS OF MEDFORD FIRE &
RESCUE
HON. GREG WALDEN
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to pay tribute to the life of Fire Operations
Chief Mark Burns of Medford Fire & Rescue.
Mark James Burns was born on June 18,
1953 in Medford, Oregon, located in the
Rogue Valley where he resided and worked
the rest of his life. Mark’s desire to help others
surfaced at an age when he became a volun-
teer firefighter as a 16-year-old.
In 1971, just months after graduation from
Crater High School in Central Point, Mark ac-
cepted a full-time firefighter position with Jack-
son County Fire District 3 and worked there
for the next 10 years. His hard work, deter-
mination, wisdom, sense of humor, and his
ability to inspire others garnered him the re-
spect of his peers and supervisors—who
quickly promoted him to Fire Engineer and
then to Fire Captain.
Throughout his fire & rescue career, Mark
consistently focused on his professional devel-
opment so he could be the best leader for his
fellow firefighters and his community. He
worked vigorously to advance his working
skills and knowledge: completing the four-year
Executive Fire Officer Program at the National
Fire Academy in Maryland, earning his Fire
Science Technology degree at Rogue Com-
munity College, his Certificate in Fire Services
Administration at Western Oregon University,
and several certifications from the Department
of Public Standards and Training.
In his leadership roles, Mark always led by
example and played a significant role in
grooming Rogue Valley’s next generation of
fire & rescue leaders. In fact, he became a
mentor to many outside his own department
while off-duty, teaching Fire Science in the
classroom at Rogue Community College and
serving as the campus Fire Science Program
Coordinator.
In 1982, Mark left Jackson County Fire Dis-
trict 3 to serve as a Shift Battalion Chief for
Medford Fire-Rescue, and in 1990 he became
their Training Chief. By 1991, Mark was pro-
moted to Operations Chief and, for the next 20
years, was responsible for all fire and rescue
emergency response within Medford city limits.
During this time, Mark led the Oregon State
Fire Marshal Region 8 Hazardous Materials
Response Team and the City of Medford
Emergency Management Team, and he
served on the Oregon Department of For-
estry’s statewide Incident Management Team.
Mark lived a life of selfless service as a fire-
fighter and first responder protecting and sav-
ing the lives and property of southern Orego-
nians. Unfortunately, while battling the Oak
Knoll Fire in Ashland on August 24, 2010,
Mark experienced intense smoke inhalation
and was medically retired in 2011 after 40
years of service. This incident caused Mark to
develop an aggravating lung condition that he
struggled with for the next five years, ulti-
mately leading to his death. Chief Burns suc-
cumbed to his fire-related illness on March 6,
2016 at the age of 62.
Over the weekend, on October 6, 2019,
Mark was one of the 119 fallen firefighters
honored at the National Fallen Firefighters Me-
morial Service in Emittsburg, MD.
Mark is survived by his wife of 45 years,
Darcy, his son, Trevis, his daughter, Karlie,
and his eight grandchildren, Kristyn, Eryn,
Zachary, Kayla, Payshens, Braylon, Brittney
and Casey. Mark is also survived by his moth-
er, Sally Burns, his sister, Patty Moser, his
brother, John Burns, and his three nieces and
nephews. He was preceded in death by his fa-
ther, Jack Burns.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me and Mark’s family in honoring the life,
service, and sacrifice of Battalion Chief Mark
Burns. May his dedication to Oregonians, our
community, and his leadership among the fire
& rescue community be long remembered and
honored.

her retirement as Captain of the Ironton Ferry.
Through her thirty years of experience and
commitment to excellence and public safety,
Captain Helen has become an indispensable
part of Michigan’s First District.
First starting operations in 1876, the Ironton
Ferry has made the 600-foot trip across the
Ironton Narrows on Lake Charlevoix for more
than 140 years—providing vehicles, cyclists,
and walkers a shortcut from the 20-mile route
around the lake’s south arm. What started as
a simple rowboat eventually turned into a
horse-powered cable ferry, before being re-
placed with its current incarnation in 1926.
The ferry has received national fame as a
subject in the Ripley’s Believe it or Not! series,
and was even referenced in writings by Ernest
Hemingway. Since 1989, Helen has captained
the ferry and has helped continue its history of
success. Notably in October 2015, Helen suc-
cessfully docked the ferry after an onboard car
caught fire. Her skill and calm demeanor in
ensuring the safety of those on the ferry was
recognized with multiple accolades, including
a plaque of meritorious commendation from
then-Sheriff Don Schneider. Her 30 years
serving as Captain of the Ironton Ferry is com-
mendable, and her impact on the people of
her community cannot be overstated.
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to congratu-
late Captain Helen Keating Dillon for her dec-
ades of service to the people of Northern
Michigan. Michiganders can take great pride in
knowing the First District is home to such a
dedicated individual. On behalf of my constitu-
ents, I wish Helen all the best in her future en-
deavors.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 110TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF DETROIT RESCUE
MISSION MINISTRIES
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to celebrate the 110th anniversary of
Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries (DRMM).
The Mission’s years of service to Detroit are
worthy of commendation.
On February 14, 1909, the Detroit Rescue
Mission was founded by David C. Stucky. The
Mission began as a soup kitchen in an old
poultry store, offering food, clothing, shelter,
and church services to Detroit’s homeless. As
the years passed, the Mission evolved to meet
the changing needs of the inner city and pro-
vide support to even more groups of disadvan-
taged people. As it grew, it began to offer new
services like substance abuse treatments,
educational courses, and job preparation train-
ing to help rebuild lives destroyed by poverty,
homelessness, and addiction.
Since its inception, the Mission has re-
mained fully committed to supporting people
across Detroit. Even during the trying years of
the Great Depression, DRMM volunteers sac-
rificed food from their own personal shelves to
ensure families would not be left to starve.
Decades later, DRMM still continues its self-
less mission and truly has become an invalu-
able resource to many in our community.
From offering medical treatments to low-in-
come mothers and their children to providing
permanent housing solutions to our nation’s
veterans, DRMM has proven an overwhelming
and lasting commitment to Detroit. I am grate-
ful for its dedicated efforts to provide hope to
hopeless, abused, and disadvantaged mem-
bers of our community.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in celebrating the 110th anniversary of De-
troit Rescue Mission Ministries. We deeply ap-
preciate DRMM’s 110 years of remarkable
service and wish the organization continued
success in the decades ahead.

RECOGNIZING THE 80TH BIRTHDAY
OF SARAGALE WEINSTOCK
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in honor of my mother-in-law, Saragale
Weinstock, on the occasion of her 80th birth-
day. Saragale lives with her husband Frank in
Boca Raton and is an incredibly loving wife,
mother of three, and grandmother of nine.
Saragale was born October 12, 1939 in Chi-
cago, IL to Cele and Dr. Samuel Reinglass.
She was raised in Canton, OH and later went
on to study at the University of Michigan for
two years and graduated from Indiana Univer-
sity. After graduating college, she met Frank
Weinstock at University Hospitals, in Cleve-
land, and the two married in 1962.
Since then, they have enjoyed a beautiful
57 years together and raised their children Mi-
chael, Jill, and Jeffrey. The family has had the
opportunity to travel the world and spend over
thirty Summer vacations in Chautauqua, NY
with four generations of family. Saragale loves
spending time with her family and her friends
at Boca Pointe.
We join in wishing ‘‘Happy Birthday’’ to my
wonderful mother-in-law Saragale. We also
wish her and her family the best in health and
happiness on this special day and moving for-
ward.

CONGRATULATING SAMARITAN
MINISTRIES ON THEIR 25TH AN-
NIVERSARY
HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Samaritan Ministries on their 25th
Anniversary. Samaritan Ministries recognizes
health care needs as multi-dimensional—re-
quiring emotional and spiritual support, as
much as physical and financial. They address
these needs by coordinating and connecting
members through prayer, encouragement, and
financial support.
Samaritan Ministries was formed by founder
Ted Pittenger, who was inspired to provide an
affordable non-insurance health care option for
the Christian community after joining a health
care sharing ministry in the 1980’s. Intrigued
by the method of sharing health care costs, he
began considering how to improve the process
to reach a wider population and share medical
needs more efficiently while maintaining Bib-
lical foundations. This idea came Samaritan
Ministries International in 1994. Since then,
this organization has helped countless of peo-
ple all through our community. I thank Samari-
tan Ministries for seeing a need in the commu-
nity and rising exceptionally to meet that need.
It is because of community pillars such as
Samaritan Ministries that I am especially
proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional Dis-
trict. Madam Speaker, I would like to again
formally congratulate Samaritan Ministries on
its 25th Anniversary.

HONORING THE LIFE OF SANDRA
WITTE
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, October 11, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize Sandra Witte, the Dean of Jordan
College of Agricultural Sciences and Tech-
nology, on her retirement from Fresno State
University after 38 years.
Ms. Witte first ventured into the dietary and
nutrition industry in the 1970’s, when she
earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Food
and Nutrition at California State Polytechnic
University. She continued her studies, earning
a Master of Science in Home Economics, Nu-
trition and Dietetics at California State Univer-
sity, Fresno. Then in 1992, she earned a Doc-
tor of Philosophy in Food Systems Manage-
ment at the Oregon State University.
Sandra has been a registered dietician
since 1975, held a certificate in Adult Weight
Management, and a certificate in Child and
Adolescent Weight Management. Her 15 years
in the nutritional industry allowed her to serve
as a well-versed program representative on
the Commission on Accreditation for Dietetics
Education Board.
Sandra began her career at Fresno State as
a professor of nutrition. She later became a
chairwoman of the Department of Food
Science and Nutrition. In 2007, she rose to as-
sume the title of Associate Dean of Academic
Affairs, and in 2014, she held the role of In-
terim Dean. In 2016, Sandra was named the
Dean of Jordan College.
Ms. Witte has had a transformative effect on
the students, staff, and community at Fresno
State. Under her administration, Jordan Col-
lege strengthened and expanded partnerships
that will have a lasting impression, including
overseeing renovations for the college’s food
science and nutrition laboratory.
As Sandra steps into the next chapter of her
life, I look forward to seeing what she will ac-
complish. She leaves a legacy of leadership,
hard-work, and determination, which will re-
main instilled in the Fresno State community.
Madam Speaker, it is with great respect that
I ask my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to congratulate Ms. Sandra Witte
on a successful career as a valued educator
and leader. It is my honor to join her family
and many friends in celebrating her retirement.
