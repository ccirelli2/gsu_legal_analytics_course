RECOGNIZING UTAH VALLEY UNI-
VERSITY STUDENTS FOR ADVO-
CACY ON BEHALF OF WOMEN IN
MOUNTAIN COMMUNITIES AT
THE 63RD SESSION OF THE COM-
MISSION ON THE STATUS OF
WOMEN
HON. BEN McADAMS
OF UTAH
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. MCADAMS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commend the members of the Utah
International Mountain Forum, a coalition of
student clubs at Utah Valley University (UVU)
on efforts to advance sustainable mountain
development around the world. These accom-
plished 13 students help highlight how UVU’s
Student Engaged Learning (SEL) model gives
students opportunities for both professional
advancement and the chance to work with
local, state, national and international leaders
to foster sustainable development, particularly
for women and girls.
Through SEL, students take the lead in
learning how to solve problems by collabo-
rating with faculty mentors. Most of the stu-
dents are nontraditional students who work
full- or part-time, are 25 years or older and
support a family while attending school.
Months of preparation preceded the New
York event. They partnered with two promi-
nent NGS—the Russian Academy of Natural
Sciences and Utah China Friendship Improve-
ment Sharing Hands Development and Co-
operation—to submit goals for addressing food
insecurity, education access and climate
change effects in mountain communities. They
participated in global events such as the 61st
and 62nd Commission on the Status of
Women and organized celebrations on Inter-
national Mountain Day and International Wom-
en’s Day that brought high-level diplomats
from around the world to see Utah’s efforts
firsthand.
During CSW63, the students hosted a par-
allel event to highlight the successful imple-
mentation of UVU’s engaged learning model
to address issues facing women and girls in
Utah. It also showcased international women
studying in Utah. Individual students presented
their own work, including Hannah Bieker who
spoke on her peers’ service projects in sup-
port of impoverished women in Mexico; Megan
Davis spoke on Utah’s distinction as the first
state to allow women to vote; William Gum-
Causey spoke on Utah and UVU’s efforts to
address aspects of the state’s rural/urban eco-
nomic divide; and Aldon Trimble spoke on
joint UVU-Oxford University research about
Utah’s air quality and how Utah addresses the
problems of the children of incarcerated par-
ents.
These combined efforts and events allowed
the UVU delegation to demonstrate the role
that students—particularly nontraditional stu-
dents—play in contributing to sustainable de-
velopment in both Utah and mountain commu-
nities around the world. By empowering them-
selves, the students help empower other com-
munities and the women and girls residing
there.

CONGRATULATING SUSAN KUBORN
FOR WINNING A GOLD MEDAL IN
THE 1,500 METER RUN AT THE
2019 SPECIAL OLYMPICS WORLD
GAMES
HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Susan Kuborn of Rockford for
winning a gold medal at the 2019 Special
Olympics World Games held in Abu Dhabi.
Susan Kuborn knew that this was a ‘‘once-
in-a-lifetime’’ opportunity and she trained hard
to win gold in the 1,500 meter run. Ms. Kuborn
was one of only seven athletes from Illinois to
compete at the Special Olympics World
Games. As a former athlete, I appreciate the
fortitude Ms. Kuborn displayed to achieve her
dream of winning gold and commend her for
her outstanding efforts. Ms. Kuborn is an ex-
ample of the importance of dedication and a
strong work ethic. I am proud there is such
young talent in our community, and to see her
represent Rockford not just here at home but
throughout the world.
It is because of leaders such as Susan
Kuborn that I am especially proud to serve Illi-
nois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam
Speaker, I would like to again formally con-
gratulate Susan Kuborn on her gold medal win
at the Special Olympics World Games.

HONORING TOYAMA KARATE-DO’S
50TH ANNIVERSARY AND 47TH
BLACK BELT GRADUATION
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I would like
to take some time today to honor Toyama Ka-
rate-Do Martial Arts Academy and recognize
their 50 years of commitment to the commu-
nity and the celebration of their 47th Black
Belt Graduation.
Toyama Karate-Do began on April 26, 1969,
and it was named after Hanshi Toyama
Kanken, who was the founder of the Shudo-
Kan style, in Okinawa, Japan. Fifty years later,
Toyama has the same mission; teach dis-
cipline, confidence, and self-defense to pre-
pare students physically and mentally to lead
a better way of life.
In 1991, Toyama Karate-Do reached South-
ern California, opening the first school in the
United States. Toyama is the most recognized
and accomplished Martial Arts Organization in
Orange County and one of the top 100
schools in the United States. Currently,
Toyama has more than 75 schools worldwide,
including locations in Bolivia, Japan, and Can-
ada.
Instructors, Rodolfo Cazales, a 7th degree
Black Belt, and his son Jerry Cazales, a 5th
Degree Black Belt, are responsible for the
United States expansion. They have been
teaching side by side to bring the ‘‘Traditional
System’’ and the ‘‘New Creative System’’ to-
gether to provide Dynamic Martial Arts Youth
Programs. Toyama Santa Ana has over 2,000
active students involved through SAUSD, City,
and Private Programs and is one of the most
successful Toyama Karate-Do programs in the
United States.
Toyama’s Creed is:
Why do we practice Karate-Do?: For a bet-
ter and stronger physical, mental, and spiritual
ability.
What are the values of Karate-Do?: Justice,
Courtesy, Humbleness, Determination, Self-
Respect, and Respect towards our Family,
Teachers, Peers, and everyone we encounter.
What is the meaning of Karate-Do?: ‘‘The
Road of the Empty Hand.’’ In Karate-Do we do
not inflict harm with an attack, but attack with
a defense to protect our life.
I recognize Toyama Karate-Do and the
Cazales family for all they do for my constitu-
ents. They truly are a great asset to the com-
munity.

RETIREMENT OF SENIOR COUNSEL
HARRY ‘‘HANK’’ SAVAGE
HON. DON YOUNG
OF ALASKA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Speaker, on May 2,
Senior Counsel Harry ‘‘Hank’’ Atack Savage is
retiring from the Office of Legislative Counsel
after 33 years. I want to commend Hank for
his long and excellent service, and his im-
provements to the many bills on which he has
worked over the years. In addition to working
for other Committees, Hank handled maritime,
Coast Guard, coastal and ocean and other
issues for the now defunct Committee on Mer-
chant Marine and Fisheries, and for the Com-
mittee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
the Committee on Natural Resources, and the
Committee on Armed Services. When I
chaired the Committee on Natural Resources
and, later, the Committee on Transportation
and Infrastructure, I was glad to have his sup-
port and expertise when drafting complex leg-
islation.
As the maritime transportation counsel,
Hank helped shepherd through Coast Guard
authorization bills, including eight in the last
nine Congresses, and a Maritime Administra-
tion authorization measure in every National
Defense Authorization Act since 1995. His
work has left a lasting impression on title 14,
Coast Guard, and title 46, Shipping, of the

United States Code. He also has drafted un-
told numbers of Jones Act waivers covering
every imaginable type vessel, ownership sce-
nario, and vessel history.
On the Natural Resources Committee, I was
particularly appreciative of his work on the
1996 update of the National Wildlife Refuge
System organic statute during my first term as
Chairman. He also worked on the first update
of the hydrographic surveying laws in half a
century, the Hydrographic reauthorization of
the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, and mul-
tiple Coastal Barrier Resources System Act
amendments, including the provision that led
to the digitization of the Coastal Barrier Re-
source system maps.
Of course, as the Congressman for All Alas-
ka, I appreciate Hank’s work on legislation re-
lated to numerous Alaska maritime and terres-
trial issues, including the environmental res-
toration and land transfers on the Pribilof Is-
lands.
Hank is a proud University of Michigan grad,
and graduated from Tulane Law School in
New Orleans.
Again, I want to thank Hank for his long and
excellent service to Congress, and I am sure
I am speaking for a long line of current and
former Committee chairmen who share those
thanks. I wish Hank and his wife, who is also
retiring for Federal Service this spring, a long
and happy retirement. I hope that will include
a trip to Alaska.

RECOGNIZING THE RECIPIENTS OF
THE 2019 FAIRFAX COUNTY STU-
DENT PEACE AWARDS
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the recipients of the 2019 Fairfax
County Student Peace Awards.
The Fairfax County Student Peace Awards
began with one high school in 2006 to encour-
age high school aged students to think about
peace as both a means and an end, and to
recognize young people who work as peace-
makers. By 2013, the program was being of-
fered in every public high school in Fairfax
County, as well as in three private schools.
Participating high schools choose one Jun-
ior or Senior, or one student group active in
promoting peace and/or removing the causes
of conflict. Examples of outreach include: com-
mitting to peace by engaging in activities that
strive to end conflict, either locally or globally,
seeking to discuss or otherwise resolve poten-
tially controversial issues within the school or
community, promoting the understanding of di-
visive issues and situations to bridge lan-
guage, ethnic, racial, religious, gender, sexual
orientation, or class differences, and working
to resolve conflicts among students or mem-
bers of the community who feel isolated or
alienated.
I am pleased to include in the RECORD the
names of this year’s Student Peace Award
winners: Kora Coker, Annandale High School;
Nick Price, Cedar Lane High School; Deepika
Joshi, Centreville High School; Yahang
‘‘Annie’’ Wang, Chantilly High School; Lara
Demir, Fairfax High School; Delina Kiflom,
Hayfield Secondary School; Lydia Goff, Hern-

Madam Speaker, the efforts of these young
people are the building blocks of a more
peaceful and tolerant world. I commend them
on their efforts and dedication, and ask my
colleagues to join me in congratulating each
award recipient and thanking them as well as
Fairfax County Public School System and

HONORING FRANCISCO HSIEH
HON. JUDY CHU
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Fran-
cisco Han Ping Hsieh, who passed away on
March 26, 2019 at the age of 85. Mr. Hsieh
played an important role in the Asian-Amer-
ican community in California for more than 50
years.
Mr. Hsieh was born in Hubei, China on Oc-
tober 14, 1933. After his graduation from
Soochow University in 1959, he worked as a
journalist, which eventually brought him to San
Francisco in 1965. There, he was employed
as a correspondent for Central Daily News,
until he went on to serve as publisher and edi-
tor at Kiu Kwong Newspaper and Chinese
Commercial News.
Following his successful career in jour-
nalism, Mr. Hsieh opened Hunan Village Res-
taurant in San Francisco, bringing the cuisine
of his childhood to the city he had grown to
love. He shared his passion for Chinese cui-
sine widely, teaching cooking classes at City
College of San Francisco and assisting in the
development of other Chinese restaurants in
the area.
Following the closure of his restaurant in
1987, Mr. Hsieh pivoted his attentions once
again, working on the campaigns of several
California politicians, including former Con-
gressman Mike Honda, former San Francisco
Mayor Willie Brown, and former Governor
Gray Davis. Mr Hsieh also served on the Cali-
fornia Acupuncture Board, the Commission on
Asian Pacific Islander American Affairs, the
California State Friendship Committee, and
the Chinese American Democratic Club.
In every part of his life, whether publishing
a weekly newspaper, bringing Hunan cuisine
to a new audience, or political activism, Fran-
cisco Hsieh spent his life sharing the subjects
he was passionate about to a wider audience,
welcoming new members into a vibrant and
robust community that he helped build. Mr.
Hsieh was a central figure in the Asian-Amer-
ican community in California for more than half
of a century. It is my honor today to pay trib-
ute to his memory and his enduring legacy.

OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Cooper
Bigelow for receiving the Adams County May-
ors and Commissioners Youth Award.
The Youth Award focuses on teenagers who
have overcome personal adversity and cre-
ated positive changes in their lives and their
community. The program provides businesses,
the community and civic leaders an oppor-
tunity to support young people in their commu-
nities and recognize their accomplishments.
Cooper is the perfect recipient for this award
because despite adversities and challenges,
he has become an inspiration and role model
for his peers.
The dedication and leadership demonstrated
by Cooper is exemplary of the type of
achievement that can be attained with hard
work and perseverance. It is essential stu-
dents at all levels strive to make the most of
their education and develop a work ethic
which will guide them for the rest of their lives.
I extend my deepest congratulations to Coo-
per Bigelow for this well-deserved recognition.

RECOGNIZING AND CELEBRATING
THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF
GOOSE CREEK CONSOLIDATED
INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT
HON. BRIAN BABIN
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize and celebrate the centennial anni-
versary of Goose Creek Consolidated Inde-
pendent School District in Baytown, Harris
County, Texas.
Goose Creek ISD was created by an act of
the Texas Legislature in February 1919. On
July 26, 1919, the first Goose Creek School
Board was organized and hired John F.
Crawford as the district’s first superintendent.
Many of the first students to attend Goose
Creek schools where children of employees of
the nearby Humble Oil and Refining Company,
later known as ExxonMobil. In 1922, the first
school bond election provided the necessary
funding for building Anson Jones Elementary
School, Baytown Elementary, and Goose
Creek High School.
Goose Creek experienced tremendous
growth during the mid-twentieth century with
the annexation of Highlands in 1936 and the
unification of the Tri-Cities of Goose Creek,
Pelly, and Baytown in 1948. Cedar Bayou ISD
merged with Goose Creek ISD on March 6,
1954, forming the Goose Creek Consolidated
Independent School District.
Today, Goose Creek Consolidated Inde-
pendent School District is the largest employer
in the community. With nearly 24,000 students
and twenty-eight schools, Goose Creek is the
fifty-eighth largest school district in the State
of Texas.
Madam Speaker, it is my distinct honor to
recognize and celebrate the 100th anniversary
of Goose Creek Consolidated Independent
School District. May God continue to bless the
students, faculty, and communities the district
serves.

IN HONOR OF DANA KERVIN AND
HER 25 YEARS OF SERVICE TO
THE HOUSTON ASSOCIATION OF
REALTORS
HON. KEVIN BRADY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I rise in rec-
ognition of Dana Kervin and her 25 years of
service to the Houston Association of Real-
tors. Over the past quarter of a century, Dana
has spent countless hours serving and improv-
ing our community.
Though not a native Texan, Dana made her
way to Houston as soon as possible. Dana
grew up in Rayville, Louisiana, and later at-
tended University of Louisiana at Monroe,
earning a bachelor’s degree in Business Ad-
ministration and Management. After gradua-
tion, Dana moved to Houston to embark on a
career in public affairs. In the Harris County
Attorney’s Office, she served as the Executive
Assistant to the late Mike Driscoll for 12 dedi-
cated years. In 1994, Dana transitioned to a
new career with the Houston Association of
Realtors (HAR), where she currently serves as
the Chief Political Strategist.
During her 25 years at the HAR, Dana has
served the group in a variety of ways, holding
diverse positions such as the Director of Prod-
ucts and Services and Government Affairs Di-
rector. In each position she held, Dana led
HAR with bold forethought and keen leader-
ship. As all who had the privilege of working
with her can attest, her tenure at HAR has
made the organization the best it can be.
Outside her work with HAR, Dana has been
a prominent figure in the Greater Houston
community. She was the Founding Board
Chair of the Greater Houston Women’s Cham-
ber of Commerce and also served as the
President of the River Oaks Place Home Own-
ers Association. As a Mayoral appointee,
Dana currently serves as Director on the
Houston Housing Finance Corporation, a posi-
tion that combines her passion for public serv-
ice and her deep knowledge of real estate fi-
nance.
Dana was awarded the Governmental Af-
fairs Outstanding Achievement Award in 2015
by the Texas Association of Realtors—an
award that is truly well-deserved. Dana was
also named one of the 50 most influential
women in Houston in the Houston Woman
Magazine, a title no doubt reflective of her
years of professional success and personal
public service.
Dana’s genuine love of her peers and dedi-
cation to making a difference has touched not
only her colleagues, friends, and family, but
our entire community. I thank you for your
years of friendship and dedication to the
Greater Houston area, and I wish you all the
best as I have no doubt you will find new
ways to be at service to the community.

decided to dedicate the 61st ride to Reynolds.
Moving to Holbrook, Arizona with his father
at a young age taught Reynolds the value of
the hard work engrained in ‘‘the cowboy life-
style.’’ He moved out of Holbrook to attend
High School in Chandler, Arizona. After grad-
uation he enlisted in the United States Marine
Corps and completed two tours in Vietnam be-
fore being wounded by an explosion that left
him hospitalized for a year. Reynolds returned
to Holbrook and became a deputy with Navajo
County Sheriff’s Office and a member of the
Posse, and later a certified police officer with
the state of Arizona.
Reynolds’ work with the Posse has led him
to aid in rescue operations for decades, work-
ing during fires and floods, as well as a part
of missing persons search teams. All mem-
bers of the Posse are required to complete 40
hours of training that cover CPR, first aid, and
search and rescue. Reynolds mentions that
most mounted Posse organizations have dis-
appeared due to lack of funds; fortunately
Navajo County understands the contributions
that the Posse has made in the community.
The annual Pony Express is one of the big-
gest fund raisers used to keep the Posse
afloat.
Today Reynolds resides in Prescott, Ari-
zona, where he spends time with his many
grandchildren. The people of Arizona, but es-
pecially the people of Northern Arizona, will al-
ways be grateful for the selfless work of our
veterans, especially the work of Steve
Reynolds.

RECOGNIZING THE OBSERVANCE
OF PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL
DAY
HON. JACK BERGMAN
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it’s my
honor today to acknowledge the observance
of Peace Officers Memorial Day.
Established by Act of Congress in 1961,
Peace Officers Memorial Day is observed on
May 15th of every year to pay tribute to the
local, state, and federal police officers who
have died or been disabled in the line of duty.
I can think of no other cause worthier of hon-
oring, or heroes worthier of remembering, than
our officers who have made the ultimate sac-
rifice to ensure peace.
Police officers in the Upper Peninsula of
Michigan and throughout the country have de-
voted their lives to protecting the innocent,
preventing violence, and upholding justice.
Every day their courage touches the lives of
countless members of their communities, and
the impact of their heroism cannot be over-
stated. The observance of Peace Officers Me-
morial Day reminds us of the ongoing need for
vigilance against all forms of crime, and the
extreme sacrifices that are made by officers in
the line of duty to ensure the safety of every
American. A ceremony in remembrance of offi-
cers originally from or who served in the
Upper Peninsula of Michigan will be held on
May 15th at Munising High School.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Michigan’s
First Congressional District, I ask you to join
me in honoring the lives and service of our po-
lice officers, especially those who have given
their lives in service to their country and com-
munities. We can never repay our debt to
these officers and their families, but by hon-
oring them today, we ensure that their legacy
is never forgotten.

LONDON PHILHARMONIC
ORCHESTRA
HON. JAMES A. HIMES
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the London Philharmonic Orchestra
for its remarkable work as an artistic and edu-
cational body. Since its foundation m 1932,
the LPO has helped spread the joys of music
through live and recorded performances, play-
ing throughout Asia, Europe, and the United
States, and recording pieces for film and
videogame soundtracks. On April 16, 2019 my
district will host the Philharmonic for their first-
ever performance in the State of Connecticut.
As one of the leading orchestras in the
world, the LPO has used its reach and influ-
ence to promote music education, foster par-
ticipation in the arts, and enhance perform-
ance skills with students from all socio-eco-
nomic backgrounds. The London Music Mas-
ters, created by LPO Chairwoman and Green-
wich-native Lady Victoria Robey, has given
1500 inner-city London students the oppor-
tunity to develop their musical skills and to
model themselves after mentors both in and
outside of the program. Through this program
and many others, Lady Robey and the LPO
have shared their love of music and made an
invaluable contribution to youth development.
Music is a uniquely powerful force. It brings
people together, speaks volumes when words
cannot, and enriches the lives of all who en-
counter it. The London Philharmonic Orchestra
has touched the lives of its audience and es-
tablished itself as an irreplaceable part of the
musical world.

CONGRATULATING OLD MONROE—
200TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to congratulate the city of Old Mon-
roe, Missouri, on the commemoration of its Bi-
centennial.
Old Monroe, located in Lincoln County, Mis-
souri, has a rich history dating back to 1673
and the exploration of Frenchmen James Mar-
quette and Louis Joliet. Old Monroe is the old-
est town in Lincoln County and was a city be-
fore Missouri obtained statehood.
In 1799, Christopher Clark settled along the
rich freshwater spring in Lincoln county. He
deemed the land to be the ‘‘finest, richest, and
most attractive district.’’ Among the first set-
tlers, were Joseph Cottle, Zadock Wood, and

his brothers: James and Martin Woods settling
near present day Old Monroe. In 1802, Ira and
Almond Cottle, relatives of Joseph Cottle,
moved from Vermont to Missouri. Several
years later, Ira and Almond established the
town of Old Monroe—named out of respect for
President James Monroe.
In 1819, the town was the site of the first
election held in Lincoln County. The Territorial
General Assembly organized 8 new counties
in Missouri, dividing them into three judicial
circuits: Southern, Northern, and North-
western. Lincoln was placed in the North-
western County. The first court of the new
Northwest Circuit was held in the home of
Zadock Woods.
In 1859, the United Evangelical church of
Old Monroe was organized by a group of Ger-
man Protestants, with approximately 50 fami-
lies participating. The next year, the congrega-
tion merged with the Evangelical Synod of
North America Church eventually becoming
the St. Paul United Church of Christ that still
stands today. The settlers sought to honor
God when establishing their town and would
be proud of how far the church has come.
The city of Old Monroe will commemorate
its 200th Bicentennial with three separate
weekends full of exciting events. The weekend
of May 4, the town will have a parade and day
in the park, along with a flag ceremony, ball
tournaments, and local historian speakers.
The weekend of June 8, Old Monroe will cele-
brate with a car show, motorcycle rally, and a
kayak river race. Finally, the weekend of Sep-
tember 14, the town will host a BBQ cook off,
street dancing, and a duck calling contest. A
celebration fit for this incredible milestone.
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in
congratulating the city of Old Monroe on their
200th Anniversary. May the town’s rich history
continue to be the foundation for an undoubt-
edly bright future.

REMARKS ON H.R. 1585, THE VIO-
LENCE AGAINST WOMEN REAU-
THORIZATION ACT
HON. TED LIEU
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in support of H.R. 1585, the Vi-
olence Against Women Reauthorization Act of
2019, which was introduced by my good friend
Representative KAREN BASS.
In 1994, Congress took the monumental
step of passing the Violence Against Women
Act to address violence against women and
men and ensure they had access to justice
and necessary services. Since its first enact-
ment, Congress has reauthorized the law sev-
eral times to provide critical updates and en-
sure that vulnerable persons, including Native
Americans and LGBTQ Americans, are pro-
tected.
While domestic violence has declined in the
past two decades, it remains too high. One-
quarter of women and one-ninth of men suffer
from intimate partner violence or intimate part-
ner stalking; moreover, every year one in 15
kids is exposed to such violence. That is why
I am pleased that we are considering H.R.
1585, which reauthorizes and improves the Vi-
olence Against Women Act. Among other
things, the bill increases the funding authoriza-
tion for the Rape Prevention and Education
Program, improves grant programs that serve
domestic violence survivors with disabilities or
who are elderly, and ensures that Native
American survivors have access to justice
Furthermore, H.R. 1585 recognizes the rela-
tionship between domestic violence and
homelessness. In the Los Angeles Continuum
of Care area, which includes my congressional
district, nearly half of women who experienced
homelessness reported that they had also ex-
perienced domestic violence and 14 percent
stated that domestic violence was the reason
they became homeless in the first place. We
know that when women leave their abusers
they are gravely concerned about finding safe
and affordable housing and that too often
they’re forced to choose between staying with
their abuser or facing homelessness. Critically,
H.R. 1585 preserves and improves housing
protections for survivors.
I’d also like to respond to criticism from my
Republican colleagues about firearms and
transgender people.
First, according to researchers from Johns
Hopkins University and others, we know that
the risk that a woman will die increases more
than fivefold when her abusive partner has ac-
cess to a firearm. H.R. 1585 acknowledges
this reality and ensures that those convicted of
stalking misdemeanors and dating violence or
who are subject to ex parte orders do not pos-
sess firearms.
Second, transgender people experience vio-
lence at disproportionately high rates—since
2013 more than 128 transgender Americans
have been killed—and they deserve access to
services for domestic violence survivors. I be-
lieve it is vitally important that the Violence
Against Women Act is inclusive of trans peo-
ple.
The Violence Against Women Reauthoriza-
tion Act takes important steps to address vio-
lence against men and women in the United
States. Thank you, Madam Speaker, for bring-
ing this bill to the House Floor. I am proud to
lend my support and vote in favor of it.

cents become successful members of society.
Mrs. Morris is an active member of her
church, the Cornerstone Baptist Church,
where she is the Choir Director. She is also a
member of the CBC Willing Working Women
Auxiliary and the Pastor Aide Auxiliary.
Mrs. Morris is a graduate of Charleston High

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 125TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF GOODWILL OF
WESTERN MISSOURI AND EAST-
ERN KANSAS
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I proudly
rise today to recognize and celebrate the
125th anniversary of Goodwill of Western Mis-
souri and Eastern Kansas, a nonprofit organi-
zation whose core foundation is aimed at pro-
viding people with the necessary resources
and life skills to become self-sufficient and
successful individuals. After decades of com-
mitment to assisting those in their commu-
nities, the organization now operates as a
product of two combined agencies, the Help-
ing Hand Institute and Goodwill Industries.
Commencement of the organization’s mis-
sion within the Kansas City area began in
1894 on Grand Boulevard with the Helping
Hand Institute, an organization committed to
providing shelter and employment resources
to those in need. The Kansas City residents
within the organization worked on the Helping
Hand Institute’s farm to feed the community or
found employment salvaging waste material,
breaking rock at quarries, and bailing paper in
exchange for food and shelter.
Along the east coast, an organization shar-
ing a similar initiative arose in 1902 inspired
by Reverend Edgar J. Helms, the social inno-
vator behind Goodwill Industries. After wit-
nessing innumerable immigrant families strug-
gle to provide for themselves due to unem-
ployment, Rev. Helms collected clothing and
household items from wealthy families to be
repurposed and resold at discounted costs.
Using the revenue generated from those
items, he funded his organization and em-
ployed a multitude of people in need of work
to provide for their families. The organization
quickly expanded across the nation, and in
1925, Goodwill Industries of Greater Kansas
City opened their first establishment at St.
Peter’s Evangelical Church on Oak Street. In
the 1940’s, Goodwill Industries wished to fur-
ther amplify their mission by making employ-
ment services like skills training and vocational
rehabilitation available to the community.
In 1978, after thoughtful deliberation, Good-
will Industries merged with the Helping Hand
Institution to form the Helping Hand of Good-
will, now officially known as ‘‘Goodwill of
Western Missouri and Eastern Kansas’’.
Today, this remarkable nonprofit organiza-
tion continues to carry out their mission by
helping community members find employment.
Their services and programs, subsidized by
grants, financial donations, and revenue gen-
erated by their stores, allow the organization
to continue their indispensable work without
any expense to the public. Additionally, Good-
will manages and operates GoodWORKS Ca-
reer Resource Centers across the Kansas City

region and other neighboring areas. These
centers are available to the public and
equipped with the resources, services and
programs needed to assist anyone with a gen-
uine desire to enter the workforce. Their serv-
ices and programs include employment list-
ings, career exploration, an overview of the
job application process, résumé building, mock
interviews, and computer training, along with
guidance in goal-setting and identifying the
steps necessary to reach those goals. Their
support and guidance are all inclusive—help-
ing those with physical disadvantages, mental
health diagnoses, substance abuse histories,
criminal backgrounds, and developmental dis-
abilities. Furthermore, they seek to empower
local job seekers with the confidence and
skills necessary to aid them in their ardent
pursuit of employment.
Since its inception, Goodwill has served
more than 600,000 people and secured more
than 200,000 paying jobs. In 2017 alone,
Goodwill served over 700 individuals, secured
155 jobs, and employed 536 new members
with a total economic impact of 18 million dol-
lars in Western Missouri and Eastern Kansas.
Moreover, they receive over 20 million pounds
of materials to be reused, resold, or recycled
annually, which kept approximately 15 million
pounds of items from ending up in landfills.
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and our col-
leagues join all of Missouri’s Fifth Congres-
sional District as we proudly commemorate
the 125 years of exceptional service and indi-
vidual empowerment rendered to our commu-
nity by the Goodwill of Western Missouri and
Eastern Kansas. Let us join in demonstrating
our strong appreciation for the perseverance
of this organization as it continues to offer es-
sential services and programs that meet the
needs of those in our community.

VOTE EXPLANATION ON H.R. 1585,
AS AMENDED
HON. BILL HUIZENGA
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to give an in-depth explanation for my
vote on H.R. 1585, legislation to reauthorize
the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, and
to speak out against the partisan process in
which the Majority crafted this bill.
Prior to the vote on H.R. 1585, I have made
clear that I support the reauthorization of The
Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). I am
frustrated by the fact that instead of putting
forward a clean reauthorization of this vital
legislation, the Democrat Majority allowed the
provision to expire at the end of the last Con-
gress for political purposes.
Protecting women from abuse is an issue so
important that partisanship shouldn’t even be
in the same sentence, yet the Majority chose
to use this opportunity to push VAWA as a
partisan political device instead of a bipartisan
opportunity to help women in need. H.R. 1585
will not be passed by the Senate in its current
form and I remain committed to seeing that
VAWA is reauthorized in a manner that pro-
tects women, makes needed reforms, and ad-
heres to the Constitution.
West Michigan is blessed to have countless
faith-based organizations that work in the
community to provide assistance to women
during their time of need, and H.R. 1585 fails
to provide protections for these faith-based
grant recipients or provide for religious hiring
exemptions. These organizations serve a vital
part in both protecting women and providing
support throughout the recovery process.
Instead of protecting women, this legislation
could in fact potentially put more women in
harm’s way and is an affront to the privacy
and safety of women. The legislation permits
biological males to be housed in women’s
prison facilities. Forcing women who have suf-
fered abuse to live and sleep in the same fa-
cility as biological males is the opposite of pro-
tecting women against violence.
I also have concerns that VAWA grants
have been used to fund Planned Parenthood.
In fact, according to a 2018 GAO report,
Planned Parenthood received approximately
$300,000 from VAWA formula grands during
2013–2015. There is no specific language in
1585 that would prohibit this from happening
in the future.
Finally, I have significant constitutional con-
cerns with section 903 of the legislation which
weakens the due process of individuals in trib-
al courts on Indian reservations. Crimes com-
mitted on reservations should be addressed
without eliminating the Bill of Rights and pre-
venting federal review in cases where tribal
capacity to adequately prosecute crimes is a
problem.
The reauthorization of VAWA should be
done in a manner that puts people, not politics
first. Going forward, I hope to be able to vote
for a truly bipartisan reauthorization of this im-
portant legislation.

Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
congratulate the Fairfax County Fire and Res-

144th Recruit Class. As they prepare to join
the ranks of the Fairfax County Fire and Res-
cue Department, I encourage the 17 grad-
uates to reflect on the history of the depart-
ment and the contributions and dedication of
the brave men and women who have served
before them to protect our community.
The Fairfax County Fire and Rescue De-
partment’s Recruit School consists of an ex-
tensive and demanding 24-week program. In
addition to two weeks of orientation, recruits
completed seven weeks of EMT training and
fifteen weeks of fire suppression training.
Upon graduation, these recruits will be cer-
tified at the level of Firefighter I/II by the Vir-
ginia Department of Fire Programs.
These recruits have the distinct honor of
joining one of the best Fire and Rescue De-
partments in the United States. The efforts of
the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Depart-
ment have been recognized across this coun-
try. Members from the Department serve on
the elite VA Task Force 1, which is among the
first units called to disaster zones to provide
search and rescue support. Members of that
Task Force were recognized by the Inter-
national Association of Fire Chiefs with the
Benjamin Franklin Award for Valor as a result
of their efforts in the aftermath of the dev-
astating earthquakes that struck Nepal in
2015. They also saw extensive work in Texas,
Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Is-
lands as part of disaster relief and rescue ef-
forts in the aftermaths of Hurricanes Harvey,
Irma and Maria.
Fairfax County is fortunate to have such ex-
cellent ambassadors for our community and I
commend them for all that they have done to
protect lives and property not only here in
Fairfax County, but around the world. As the
newest members of the Fire and Rescue De-
partment, the 144th Recruit Class graduates
join the department as integral parts of our
community’s emergency response and public
safety team. I am confident that this grad-
uating class will serve the residents of Fairfax
County with honor and distinction. It is my
great honor to include in the RECORD the
names of the 144th Recruit Class:

CONGRATULATING THE PEORIA
PLAYERS THEATRE ON ITS 100TH
ANNIVERSARY
HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the Peoria Players Theatre on its
100th anniversary. This milestone now makes
the Peoria Players Theatre the oldest running
regional theater in Illinois and fourth oldest in
the nation.
The Peoria Players Theatre first got its start
back in 1919, where it originally was called the
Peoria Women’s Club home. Prior to settling
in their current location in Lakeview park,
where they have been since 1957, the Peoria
Players Theatre has put on shows in places
like the abandoned fire station on Jackson
Street to the local high school auditorium—all
without missing a beat. Not once has the Peo-
ria Players Theatre closed its doors through-
out its 100-year history; instead, they just kept
entertaining the people of Peoria with every-
thing from original plays to musicals. Peoria is
lucky to have the Peoria Players Theatre rep-
resent the community so well, and I cannot
wait to see what local talent they produce over
the next 100 years.
It is because of dedicated organizations
such as the Peoria Players Theatre that I am
especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Con-
gressional District. Madam Speaker, I would
like to again formally congratulate the Peoria
Players Theatre on its 100th anniversary.

VOTE EXPLANATION ON H.R. 1644
HON. DAVID B. McKINLEY
OF WEST VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. MCKINLEY. Madam Speaker, on
Wednesday, I voted against H.R. 1644 be-
cause it could open Internet Service Providers
(ISP’s) in rural areas to burdensome regula-
tions that stifle innovation and slow the de-
ployment of efficient and reliable broadband
internet service. I would like to take this oppor-
tunity to discuss my vote.
A free and open internet is critically impor-
tant, but heavy-handed regulation is not the
only way to achieve net neutrality. I support
the important concepts of no blocking, no
throttling, and no paid prioritization and have
cosponsored legislation to support this includ-
ing: The Promoting Internet Freedom and In-
novation Act of 2019 (H.R. 1096), the Open
Internet Act of 2019 (H.R. 1006), and AC-
CESS BROADBAND Act (H.R. 1328.)
Congress passed the Telecommunications
Act of 1996, designating broadband as a Title
I Information Service and subjecting it to a
‘‘light touch’’ regulatory system. As a result,
the internet transformed into one of the most
important drivers of economic growth and job
creation.
In 2015, the Obama Administration’s Fed-
eral Communications Commission (FCC) re-
classified the internet as a Title II Tele-
communications Service, implementing heavy
regulations and reporting requirements origi-
nally intended for rotary landline phones. This
action led to a $3.6 billion decline in
broadband investment; the first period of de-
clining investment in the internet era. In 2017,
the Trump FCC reversed the order to return
the internet to its original light touch frame-
work.
H.R. 1644 would bring back the heavy-
handed regulation and government control of
the internet. The measure would lock in ap-
proximately 700 unpublished rules that have
not been shared with Members of Congress,
some of which would allow the FCC to set
rates, impose new taxes, approve the deploy-
ment of new technologies, and dictate how
internet companies interact with their cus-
tomers. The internet has thrived without gov-
ernment intervention and should continue to
do so.
Most importantly, I have heard from many
small internet service providers in West Vir-
ginia that the reclassification forced them to
comply with extensive rules. These rules re-
quire them to write new policies, take money,
and employee time to complete verifications
on prioritization that they were not capable of
engaging in to begin with. This bureaucracy is
not only incredibly burdensome to small busi-
nesses, but it drives vital resources away from
the deployment of broadband internet service
in rural areas that need it most.
Lacking broadband service is more than an
inconvenience, it is a barrier to education,
connectivity, and economic growth. It is my
hope that we can arrive at a permanent bipar-
tisan solution that protects consumers, encour-
ages innovation, and preserves an open inter-
net. Unfortunately, this bill does not accom-
plish that.
I am hopeful that we can come to a bipar-
tisan solution in good faith. The state of West
Virginia is blessed with beautiful mountains
and heavily forested land. However, the geog-
raphy that makes our state so special also
poses unique challenges in deploying internet
technology.

Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize and commemorate the
100th anniversary of the American Classical
League (ACL). The ACL is dedicated to sup-
porting and teaching Greek and Latin lan-
guages, literatures, and cultures.
Since 1919, the ACL has grown from a
gathering of several Classical advocates to a
national community of almost 2,500 educators,
teaching grades PreK through college. The or-
ganization now offers opportunities for dis-
covery for all ages, boasting more than 44,000
students grades 6–12 worldwide. Additionally,
the ACL’s program ‘‘Excellence Through
Classics’’ is celebrating 30 years of service of
teachers of the youngest scholars.
The ACL has illustrated that the value of
Latin and Greek all-encompassing cultural
education programs in today’s society cannot
be understated. It continues to enrich the lives
of students through imparting an under-
standing of the foundational aspects of ancient
classical civilizations. This education is a
priceless gift that lends itself to having a well-
rounded education and gives supports to other
core subjects by improving English language
and literacy skills such as reading, writing and
vocabulary development.
I am amazed by the work the American
Classical League does and wish them well as
they continue to build bridges from our past
into our future for the next 100 years.

RECOGNIZING THE VILLAGE OF
MILFORD
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the Village of Milford’s
150th anniversary of incorporation on April 12,
2019. Located in southwest Oakland County,
Milford began with the building of a sawmill by
Elizur and Stanley Ruggles in 1832 and was
incorporated in 1869. Hydropower made it
possible for Milford to become one of the first
communities to have electric lights in 1892.
Known for its small-town charm and rich his-
tory, the North Milford Historic District was en-
tered into the National Register of Historic
Places on April 21, 2000. Downtown Milford is
recognized for its lively events and entertain-
ment as well as its local shopping and dining.
Milford is also home to the General Motors
Proving Ground, the world’s first dedicated
automobile testing facility. The Proving Ground
has been used to introduce industry-leading
safety features such as front center air bags.
The facility has also helped create a global
standard for frontal crash test dummies and
was the first rollover test facility.
I encourage everyone to come to Michigan’s
11th congressional district and, as we say,
‘‘meet me in Milford.’’ On its 150th anniver-
sary, the Village of Milford has much to cele-
brate. I ask my colleagues to join me in cele-
brating this tremendous milestone.

HONORING ANN WEAVER NORTON
AND THE ANN NORTON SCULP-
TURE GARDEN
HON. LOIS FRANKEL
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Ms. FRANKEL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in honor of Ann Weaver Norton and on
behalf of the Ann Norton Sculpture Garden in
West Palm Beach, Florida.
Ann Norton was an inspirational artist. She
found her passion at age 8, when she re-
ceived her first sculpting tools. She eventually
moved to New York where she studied at the
National Academy of Design, the Arts Student
League of New York and Cooper Union. Ann
served as an apprentice to the famed sculp-
ture John Hovannes and a studio assistant to
Alexander Archipenko. Her artwork was well
received and she participated in numerous
shows at the Museum of Modern Art and the
Whitney Museum of American Art.
In 1942, Ann moved to West Palm Beach
and began teaching at the Norton Gallery and
School of Art. Five years later, she married
Ralph Norton, the school’s founder. In 1977,
Ann established the Ann Norton Sculpture
Gardens Foundation. The sculpture garden
and the foundation work to preserve the art-
work of Ann Norton and other unique local
treasures. The Norton Sculpture Gardens
commemorates the great artwork and culture
Ann brought to the community of South Flor-
ida.
On February 9, 2019, the Norton Sculpture
Garden held a grand reopening. After $100
million in renovations over eight years, the
museum now includes an additional 12,000
square feet of gallery space and a new exte-
rior. On display one will experience artwork
from the likes of Jackson Pollock, Claude
Monet, and Georgia O’Keeffe.
I proudly join the Ann Norton Sculpture Gar-
den in celebrating the induction of Ann Norton
to the Florida Artist Hall of Fame this Satur-
day, April 13, 2019.
NICOLE MARTINEZ
HON. ED PERLMUTTER
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Nicole Mar-
tinez for receiving the Adams County Mayors
and Commissioners Youth Award.
The Youth Award focuses on teenagers who
have overcome personal adversity and cre-
ated positive changes in their lives and their
community. The program provides businesses,
the community and civic leaders an oppor-
tunity to support young people in their commu-
nities and recognize their accomplishments.
Nicole is the perfect recipient for this award
because despite adversities and challenges,
she has become an inspiration and role model
for her peers.
The dedication and leadership demonstrated
by Nicole is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and
perseverance. It is essential students at all
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will
guide them for the rest of their lives.
I extend my deepest congratulations to Ni-
cole Martinez for this well-deserved recogni-
tion. I have no doubt she will exhibit the same
dedication and character in all of her future
accomplishments.

HONORING THE WORLD WAR II
AND KOREAN WAR VETERANS
OF ILLINOIS
HON. MIKE QUIGLEY
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor the World War II and Korean War vet-
erans who traveled to Washington, D.C. on
April 10, 2019 with Honor Flight Chicago, a
program that provides World War II and Ko-
rean War veterans the opportunity to visit their
memorials on The National Mall in Wash-
ington, D.C. These memorials were built to
honor their courage and service to their coun-
try.
The American Veteran is one of our great-
est treasures. The Soldiers, Airmen, Sailors,
Marines, and Coast Guardsmen who traveled
here on April 10th answered our nation’s call
to service during one of its greatest times of
need. From the European Campaign to the
Pacific Asian Theatre to the African Theater,
these brave Americans risked life and limb,
gave service and sacrificed much, all while
embodying what it is to be a hero. We owe
them more gratitude than can ever be ex-
pressed.
I welcome these brave veterans to Wash-
ington and to their memorials. I am proud to
include in the RECORD the names of these
men and women for all to see, hear, and rec-
ognize, and I call on my colleagues to rise and
join me in expressing gratitude.

IN HONOR OF ASSOCIATED BUILD-
ERS AND CONTRACTORS OF
GREATER HOUSTON 50TH ANNI-
VERSARY
HON. KEVIN BRADY
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, today, I rise
in recognition of the 50th Anniversary of the
Associated Builders and Contractors of Great-
er Houston. For the last half-century, this
group has contributed greatly to the construc-
tion and advancement of the Greater Houston
Area and I thank them for their work in grow-
ing our community.
Founded in 1969, the Associated Builders
and Contractors (ABC) of Greater Houston
provides leadership development and craft
training for both the commercial and industrial
construction industries. The Greater Houston
Chapter of ABC is comprised of over 450 lo-
cally owned construction and assembly firms,
representing thousands of skilled professionals
in the Greater Houston Area.
The mission of ABC of Greater Houston is
to defend and represent its members’ right to
work, as well as protecting free enterprise
within the construction industry. ABC of Great-
er Houston is also committed to promoting
safe work environments and occupational
practices, and leads the country in members
active in the Safety Training Evaluation Proc-
ess (STEP) program—a unique initiative start-
ed in 1989 to dramatically improve safety per-
formance in the construction industry.
ABC of Greater Houston is committed to
tackling our nation’s workforce problem
through the Construction and Maintenance
Education Foundation (CMEF). This excep-
tional foundation formulates partnerships be-
tween industrial leaders and contractors to
tackle the shortage of skilled workers in the
construction sector.
Today, the American economy is booming,
in no small part because of leadership from
outstanding organizations like ABC of Greater
Houston. Through their innovative programs
that enhance industry partnerships and pro-
mote free enterprise, ABC has provided op-
portunities for economic and educational
growth among members, workers, and indus-
try professionals.
This year marks 50 incredible years of in-
dustry advancement by ABC of Greater Hous-
ton. I am proud to join everyone in our com-
munity in celebrating their 50th Anniversary,
and thanking them for the work they do for
builders and contractors in the Houston area,
across Texas, and throughout the country. I
am sure their next 50 years will be even more
successful.
CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF
DALLAS MAVERICKS LEGEND
DIRK NOWITZKI
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
after 21 seasons as the face of the Dallas
Mavericks, Dirk Nowitzki played his final game
in Dallas. Since he arrived as a 19 year-old
from Germany, Dirk has transformed the game
of basketball and led the Mavericks to unpar-
alleled success.
He has earned the respect of fans and fel-
low players alike over the course of his
record-setting career. In his early days in the
NBA, however, he faced great adversity. But
his resilience and determination proved too
strong for any negativity. Dirk’s leadership and
great play culminated in a championship run in
2011. Because of his MVP performance, a
championship banner now hangs in the Amer-
ican Airlines Center, which I can see from my
District Office in Dallas. This building, which
was the setting for many of Dirk’s greatest
games and most memorable moments, will
forever be known as ‘‘the house that Dirk
built.’’
His accolades on the court are many—15
appearances in the NBA Playoffs, a 14-time
NBA All-Star, a 12-time All-NBA team mem-
ber, one of only eight players to score 30,000
points, a regular season MVP award, a Finals
MVP award, and an NBA Championship. But
the true measure of the man is what he has
done off the court. For years, he has visited
Children’s Hospital as ‘‘Uncle Dirk’’ to give ill
children and their families fond memories and
glimmers of happiness. Never with fanfare,
never with TV cameras chronicling his gen-
erous deeds, Dirk gave of himself out of the
goodness of his heart and character. For as
much as we have enjoyed his iconic three-
pointers and fade-away jumpers, he has given
us so much more. In addition to being one of
the greatest athletes to ever play in Dallas,
Dirk Nowitzki is one of the best human beings
to play in Dallas.
Madam Speaker, no one embodies the big,
beautiful, diverse city of Dallas better than Dirk
Nowitzki. Like me, he wasn’t born in Dallas
but made it his home, and we are grateful that
he did. As he retires from professional basket-
ball, we are delighted that he will always be a
part of what makes Dallas great, and I wish
my friend and his family the best in the days
and years ahead.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E462 April 12, 2019
Ohio in celebration of this special occasion. I,
along with my sorority sisters, are forever
grateful for the founders of Alpha Omicron Pi’s
commitment to ensuring young women de-
velop lifelong friendships while enhancing one
another’s lives through scholarship and serv-
ice.
Alpha Omicron Pi (AOII) has been an inte-
gral part of college campuses since its found-
ing in 1897 by Stella George Stern Perry,
Helen St. Clair Mullan, Elizabeth Heywood
Wyman, and Jessie Wallace Hughan at Bar-
nard College of Columbia University in New
York City. The organization has seen tremen-
dous growth since its inception as an all fe-
male sorority, with over 191,000 initiated
members from 144 collegiate chapters. Mem-
bers can be identified by their ruby pins, the
red rose, and the Panda mascot. Each new
member receives a pin upon her initiation,
known as the AOII badge, where the Greek
letters, Alpha, Omicron, and Pi are super-
imposed one upon the next in order.
Founded on the ideals of character, dignity,
scholarship, and college loyalty, AOII helps
young women cultivate values of account-
ability and ownership, collaboration, engage-
ment, innovation, and open and honest com-
munication skills. AOII’s philanthropic values
are demonstrated by a dedication to raising
money for and spreading awareness of the Ar-
thritis Foundation. By holding annual Strike
Out Arthritis events both at the chapter and
national levels, AOII has been able to con-
tribute millions of dollars toward education ini-
tiatives and assistance for families affected by
arthritis. AOII’s fundamental hope in fund-
raising and education is to one day contribute
to finding a cure for this disease that impacts
millions of Americans.
The Omega Chapter was founded on Janu-
ary 4, 1919 at Miami University, originating
from a local sorority named Kappa Tau Sigma.
Founded in scholarship, AOII became the
fourth sorority on Miami’s campus. Originally
holding chapter meetings in various class-
rooms, AOII eventually obtained a more per-
manent home in Hamilton Hall and later Rich-
ard Hall. Focused on the motto to ‘‘engage in
service’’, AOII sisters have recently been in-
volved with various philanthropies across the
Oxford community, to name a few, including
Spring Clean Oxford, Relay for Life, Miles for
Smiles 5K, Adopt-a-School, Big Brothers/Big
Sisters, and the Knolls of Oxford nursing
home event where Miami athletic teams and
Greek chapters are paired together to com-
plete tasks. During the philanthropy round of
recruitment, sisters also decorate t-shirts for
stuffed panda bears that are given to patients
at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. From
Strike Out Arthritis to the annual Red Rose
Ball to the AOPirate Party, the sisters of the
Omega chapter have cemented a lasting pres-
ence on the Miami campus.
A testament to the character and dedication
of this talented group of women, the Omega
Chapter has been honored with numerous
awards and accolades. They’ve been awarded
the AOII International’s Jessie Wallace
Hughan award in 1979 and various Miami
Panhellenic awards such as the Outstanding
Rush Award, Greek Week champions, and
Songfest winners. Committed to character,
dignity, scholarship, and loyalty the Omega
Chapter was also honored with the Miami Uni-
versity Five Pillar Award for Excellence in
Scholarship & Learning, Service & Philan-
thropy, Community, Leadership & Values, and
Brotherhood & Sisterhood.
The sorority’s personalized approach to
membership has made the Omega Chapter
home to a robust alumni network with grad-
uates developing accomplished careers in
business, non-profit, academic, community
leadership, and government service across the
country. The sorority’s national publication, the
To Dragma, keeps all current and past mem-
bers connected with ongoing events and the
successes of various chapters nationwide.
It is important to our nation’s future to en-
courage and raise a new generation of Ameri-
cans who have the skills, knowledge, and
compassion to make the world a better place.
The sisters of the AOII Omega Chapter have
demonstrated 100 years of commitment and
service to others. Their outstanding work is an
inspiration to the nation. Congratulations on a
century of excellence in community service
and for cultivating a network of caring, loving
sisters who will work to ensure Alpha Omicron
Pi’s success in the next century. Love and
honor to all AOII Omega sisters.

CONGRATULATING MR. AND MRS.
CLIFFORD AND ANNA LEE
JONES’ 70TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor Mr. and Mrs. Clifford and
Anna Lee Jones and congratulate them on
their 70th Wedding Anniversary. This incred-
ible milestone anniversary will be celebrated
on May 25, 2019.
Clifford and Anna Lee both grew up on fam-
ily farms in Wayne County, Missouri. After
marrying on May 27, 1949, the young couple
moved to O’Fallon in St. Charles County, MO
where they raised three sons. Clifford and
Anna Lee lived in Winfield upon retirement
and eventually settled in Troy where they still
reside today. Throughout their lives, Clifford
and Anna Lee have exuded the hardworking
mentality of Missouri and the Midwest. Clifford
worked for Ford Motor Company and Kroger
Warehouse both in Hazelwood. Anna Lee
spent her working years at the plastic factory
in St. Louis before joining H&K bakery located
in O’Fallon—all while raising a family.
In their spare time, Clifford and Anna Lee
continue to enjoy many hobbies. Clifford can
often be found working on lawnmowers and
cars. Anna Lee enjoys quilting and numerous
crafts. In their retirement years, both Clifford
and Anna Lee relish spending time with family
and friends and attending functions at the Troy
Senior Center. They also socialize throughout
the week at Hardee’s in Troy with their friend
group that is often referred to as their ‘‘break-
fast club’’.
Clifford and Anna Lee have been blessed
with 3 sons, 7 grandchildren, 9 great grand-
children, and 1 great, great grandchild. They
consider their family their proudest accom-
plishment, as many of us do.
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in
congratulating Mr. and Mrs. Jones on their
70th Wedding Anniversary. May they have
many more happy years to come.
TRIBUTE TO PAM HALL
HON. JIM JORDAN
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to commend to the House the out-
standing service of Pam Hall of Marion, Ohio,
President of the Marion Area Chamber of
Commerce. Pam is retiring after more than
two decades in that role.
Pam first got involved with the Chamber
during her 27-year career at the engineering
firm Floyd Browne Associates, where she was
the only woman to date to be offered a part-
nership. When the Chamber presidency be-
came open, she sold her share in the com-
pany to take on this new challenge.
The Marion Chamber has remained strong
under Pam’s selfless leadership and commit-
ment to the success of the local economy.
She has been instrumental in helping area
businesses connect and find common ways to
solve problems. The community at large has
benefited from her tireless work on the Lead-
ership Marion program, which helps local en-
trepreneurs and others develop leadership
skills.
Pam’s work goes far beyond her service
with the Chamber. She is a longtime United
Way supporter, past president of Marion Noon
Kiwanis, and a member of the Rotary Club of
Marion. She also serves on the Marion County
Foundation Board, the Marion Area Coun-
seling Center Board, the Rushmore Academy
Board, the Marion Matters Board, and many
others. The Women’s Business Council of
Marion honored her with its 2017 ATHENA
Leadership Award.
Several years ago, Pam was diagnosed with
colon cancer. While she has continued her
good work with the Chamber since her diag-
nosis, she has decided to step down to focus
on her health. Throughout her treatment, she
has openly shared the details of her diagnosis
and treatment regimen so that others might
learn and benefit from her experiences.
Madam Speaker, the Marion Area Chamber
of Commerce will celebrate Pam’s achieve-
ments at its annual barbecue on April 27. On
behalf of the people of Ohio’s Fourth Congres-
sional District, I am proud to join in the acco-
lades to her. She has my very best wishes
and my thanks for her decades of service to
the people of Marion.

INTRODUCTION OF A RESOLUTION
TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THE
DESIGNATION OF APRIL 2019 AS
NATIONAL DONATE LIFE MONTH
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, since 2003,
April has been recognized as ‘‘National Do-
nate Life Month.’’ Every year, the month
serves as an opportunity to encourage organ
and tissue donor registration, recognize those
individuals who continue to wait for an organ
transplantation, and honor living and deceased
donors and their families for their gift of life.

the public is encouraged to wear blue and

green to promote organ donation awareness,
I am proud to introduce a bipartisan resolution
to recognize April 2019 as ‘‘National Donate
Life Month’’ and support its goals and ideals.
Every ten minutes, a person is added to the
national transplant waiting list. As of April
2019, more than 113,000 people are awaiting
an organ donation. Unfortunately, despite over
145 million people registered to be donors, the
need for donated organs outweighs the supply
of organs. Sadly, on average, 20 people die
each day while waiting for an organ transplant.
The simple truth is that organ donation and
transplantation saves lives. In fact, organ do-
nation from a single deceased donor can ben-
efit up to eight individuals and tissue donation
can benefit an additional 75 people or more.
Living kidney and liver donors provide trans-
plant candidates with the chance to live
longer.
I am proud to sponsor this resolution in the
U.S. House of Representatives again and rec-
ognize that organ donation is the gift of life.

SAMANTHA GAMINO
HON. ED PERLMUTTER
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize and applaud Samantha
Gamino for receiving the Adams County May-
ors and Commissioners Youth Award.
The Youth Award focuses on teenagers who
have overcome personal adversity and cre-
ated positive changes in their lives and their
community. The program provides businesses,
the community and civic leaders an oppor-
tunity to support young people in their commu-
nities and recognize their accomplishments.
Samantha is the perfect recipient for this
award because despite adversities and chal-
lenges, she has become an inspiration and
role model for her peers.
The dedication and leadership demonstrated
by Samantha is exemplary of the type of
achievement that can be attained with hard
work and perseverance. It is essential stu-
dents at all levels strive to make the most of
their education and develop a work ethic
which will guide them for the rest of their lives.
I extend my deepest congratulations to
Samantha Gamino for this well-deserved rec-
ognition. I have no doubt she will exhibit the
same dedication and character in all of her fu-
ture accomplishments.

MR. KEN CARTER
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the retirement of Mr. Ken
Carter after many years of service to his coun-
try. His time as an independent contractor,
government contractor, and Supervisory Con-
tract Specialist has been invaluable, and we
wish him well in his well-deserved retirement.
Mr. Ken Carter is a retired enlisted airman,
retiring as Senior Master Sergeant after 23
years of service. With more than 38 years of
experience in contracting, his experience in-
cludes major construction, commodities, serv-
ices, R&D, and Systems Engineering. In terms
of higher education, Mr. Carter holds a Bach-
elor of Science degree in Organizational Man-
agement Development from Bluefield College
and an Associate Degree in Contract Manage-
ment from the Community College of the Air
Force. Mr. Carter also holds an Unlimited
Contracting Officer Warrant with the VA and a
Level III Contracting Professional Certification.
Currently serving as a Supervisory Contract
Specialist with the VA, he is responsible for
the supervision of 5 subordinate employees.
Prior to assuming this position, Mr. Carter pro-
vided services as a Procurement Coordinator
within the Strategic Acquisitions Center ARRC
Directorate. His previous assignments include
a five-year tour with the Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration where he completed the largest
single major contract in the history of the
Agency. Beyond his illustrious career, Mr. Car-
ter enjoys fishing, doing yard work, camping in
the Shenandoah Valley, and attending football
games at James Madison University where his
grandson is a member of the JMU Marching
Royal Dukes band. Residing in Spotsylvania
County with his wife Ronna Carter, it is easy
to see that Mr. Carter has led a wonderful,
purpose filled life.
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in
recognizing the bounty of Mr. Ken Carter’s ac-
complishments as he enters retirement. To
that end, we hope that he enjoys the extra
time he has with his family, his football games,
as well as with his fishing poles.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF
CHARLES EUGENE GEE
HON. BRIAN BABIN
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
remember the life of Charles Eugene Gee of
Jasper, Texas, who recently lost his four-year
battle with cancer. Mr. Gee passed away at
his home surrounded by loved ones on April
3, 2019.
Charles Eugene Gee, more affectionately
known as Charlie, was born on October 10,
1942 in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. His family
eventually moved to Jasper, Texas, where he
graduated from Jasper High School in 1960
and married his high school sweetheart, Sue
Hollis Gee, in July of 1962.
In 1966, Charlie graduated from Stephen F.
Austin State University with a Bachelor’s de-
gree in Agriculture and Forestry. He began
working as a new-hire for Kirby Lumber Co.
and eventually became the logging super-
intendent. After 18 years with Kirby, Charlie
decided to start his own logging business,
Charles Gee Logging Inc. Over the years, he
worked many long hours as the dedicated and
successful owner of his logging company, as
well as several other local businesses. In fact,
Charlie later became the State Coordinator for
the Texas Logging Counsel, a position in
which he served proudly to improve conditions
for future generations of loggers.
After his college graduation, Charlie became
a dedicated member of the Jasper Volunteer
Fire Department. During his time at the de-
partment, he served as an original member of
the Board of Trustees for the Texas Fire Mu-
seum, president of the East Texas Firemen
and Fire Marshall’s Association, a member on
the committee for the Retirement and Pension
Fund for Jasper’s firemen, and even as the
Fire Chief. He also became an instructor for
the Texas A&M Fire School in College Station,
where he eagerly shared his years of fire-fight-
ing knowledge and experience with younger
generations. His devotion and service will live
on through the various fire departments in
Jasper County and surrounding areas that
were established on his instruction.
Charlie is survived by his bride of nearly 57
years, Sue Hollis Gee; his daughters Sarah
Smith and husband Sam; Laura McMillon and
husband Mitch; Rebecca Soisson and hus-
band Scott; Jennifer Cline and husband Billy;
and brother Bill Gee and wife Sue. Charlie is
also survived by his grandchildren: Matthew
and wife Halea; Ashleigh, Charlie, John,
Henry, Jacob, Emily, Michael, Brian, Brandon,
and Grant, as well as four great-grandchildren.
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to remem-
ber the life of Charles Eugene Gee. May God
comfort his family during this time.

CONGRATULATING JOHN REID
FROM JOHN DEERE FOR HIS
ELECTION TO THE NATIONAL
ACADEMY OF ENGINEERING
HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize John Reid for his election into the
National Academy of Engineering through his
company, John Deere. Election to the Acad-
emy is among the highest professional distinc-
tions accorded to an engineer, and Dr. Reid
was elected for innovation in automation tech-
nologies for agricultural systems.
Membership in the National Academy of En-
gineering honors those who have made out-
standing contributions to engineering, includ-
ing significant contributions to the engineering
literature and to the pioneering of new and de-
veloping fields of technology, advancements in
traditional fields of engineering, or innovative
approaches to engineering education. John
Reid graduated from Virginia Tech with a
bachelors and master’s degree in agricultural
engineering. He obtained his Ph.D. from
Texas A&M in 1987. Dr. Reid is currently the
Director of Product Technology & Innovation
at John Deere, and is also a full professor at
the University of Illinois at Urbana—Cham-
paign. Dr. Reid has created several patents
with the U.S. Patent Office in the years he has
worked at John Deere. He is also on the
board of several organizations in the Moline
area.
It is because of dedicated leaders such as
John Reid that I am especially proud to serve
Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam
Speaker, I would like to again formally con-
gratulate John Reid for his acceptance into the
National Academy of Engineering.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE
OF RICHARD SPROULE
HON. JACK BERGMAN
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, April 12, 2019
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my
honor to recognize the life and service of
Richard Sproule. As a proud Veteran of the
United States Marine Corps, Richard has
proven himself to be an indispensable part of
Michigan’s First District.
The Continental Marines were formed by
decree of the Second Continental Congress
on November 10, 1775. Since the Revolu-
tionary War, Marines served with the Amer-
ican Expeditionary Force on the Western Front
of WWI, island hopped in the Pacific, landed
on the beaches of North Korea, fought to pro-
tect the Republic of Vietnam, and defended
Americans from the threat of global terrorism.
Rick served a crucial role during his service in
the Marines, maintaining jet engines and en-
suring the safety and fighting capacity of our
Airmen. His unwavering devotion to duty per-
fectly exemplifies the spirit of the U.S. Marine
Corps. We owe Rick and his brothers in arms
an enormous debt of gratitude. He has served
our nation willingly, honorably, and without
bias.
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor today to ac-
knowledge the extraordinary life of Richard
Sproule. I ask that you join with me and the
people of Michigan’s First District in thanking
him for his unwavering commitment to our na-
tion and its people.
