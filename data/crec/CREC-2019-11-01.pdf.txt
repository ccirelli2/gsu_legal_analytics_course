PRAYER
Reverend Dr. Dan C. Cummins, Cap-
itol Worship, Washington, D.C., offered
the following prayer:
We bow before You, O Sovereign Mag-
istrate, in the solemn gaze of Moses,
Your emissary and lawgiver of truth
revealed, considering with all gravity
the eternal consequences our actions
create whenever we judge our fellow
man, knowing we shall all stand before
the judgment seat of Christ and give an
account to Him of every pejorative
word spoken.
For with what measure we judge,
from such measure we shall receive our
deserved judgment.
So may we first carefully examine
our own eye, asking Your Holy Spirit
to reveal and remove any beams that
have blemished our veracity.
May You be judge, O God, and plead
our cause against the ungodly, for we
have all sinned.
Deliver us from deceitful and unjust
men, for there is nothing hidden that
shall not be revealed. Mendacities spo-
ken in darkness shall be shouted from
the housetops.
For Your mercy and grace we plead,
Lord Jesus.
Amen.

RECOGNIZING MS. STEPHANIE
WALKER
HON. DOUG COLLINS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 1, 2019
Mr. COLLINS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Ms. Stephanie Walker for her
impactful work and leadership in school bus
operation.
Ms. Walker started out as a bus driver, car-
rying on the legacy of both of her parents,
who have been driving buses for Habersham
County for over 30 years. Years later, Ms.
Walker is continuing to impact school trans-
portation through her role as transportation co-
ordinator for Habersham County Schools.
Earlier this year, Ms. Walker became the
first and only woman in Georgia, and the
eighth Georgian overall, to become a Certified
Director of Pupil Transportation. She is also
the only person in the state of Georgia to be-
come certified as Director of Pupil Transpor-
tation and in Special Needs Transportation.
Ms. Walker’s focus on enhancing safety pro-
tocols has changed Habersham County
Schools for the better. During her seven years
as transportation coordinator, Ms. Walker has
reworked and created emergency routes to
ensure the safety of students and staff alike.
With 115-plus buses and their passengers to
account for every day, her job is not easy, but
she enjoys the challenge.
Ms. Walker’s notable work ethic and dedica-
tion has earned her a place in the national
spotlight. Earlier this month, she was recog-
nized by School Transportation News, a na-
tional publication, as one of ten ‘‘Rising Stars’’
for her work as an up-and-coming student
transportation professional who displays lead-
ership or innovation in school bus operation.
The students of Habersham County Schools
are fortunate to have someone like Ms. Steph-
anie Walker working to keep them safe every
day. On behalf of the people of Northeast
Georgia, I want to thank her for her commit-
ment to student safety and congratulate her
for being recognized as a ‘Rising Star’ in
school transportation.

HONORING THE PASSING OF
ARIZONA TEACHER, CATHY CANEZ
HON. TOM O’HALLERAN
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 1, 2019
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to pay my respects to Cathy Canez, a
special education teacher from my district,
who passed away earlier this year in a tragic
accident.
Cathy was a beloved teacher, friend, and
community member in the Miami unified
school district for more than 25 years.
Her kindness, sense of humor, and dedica-
tion to the success of her students has al-
lowed her legacy and impact to reach beyond
the classroom.
I’ve been married to a teacher for fifty years;
I saw how hard my wife Pat worked to edu-
cate young people and improve their lives ho-
listically.
Teachers have one of the most important
jobs in our society, and a great teacher like
Cathy had the power to affect the lives of so
many.
Cathy was taken from us too soon.
Arizona has lost an incredible role model
and educator, but I know she will not soon be
forgotten.

RECOGNITION OF MRS. YVETTE
DUBOSE AS A 2019 ANGELS IN
ADOPTION HONOREE
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 1, 2019
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, it is my
great privilege to rise today to honor Mrs.
Yvette DuBose, for her extraordinary contribu-
tions as the CEO/Executive Director of the
Heart Gallery of Broward County and as a car-
ing foster parent herself.
Yvette was recognized as a 2019 Angels in
Adoption by the Congressional Coalition on
Adoption Institute (CCAI). She is admired in
our community for her steadfast commitment
to the welfare of children as both a caring fos-
ter parent and as the Executive Director of the
Heart Gallery of Broward County, as well as
serving as a Board Member of the Heart Gal-
lery of Florida and the Children Families Lead-
ership Association. Her leadership at the Heart
Gallery has led to more than 350 adoptions of
foster children to their forever families, chang-
ing the course of their lives. Yvette’s long-
standing dedication truly exemplifies the val-
ues of the Angels in Adoption program.
Founded in 2001, CCAI is a nonprofit orga-
nization with the vision that every child should
know the love and support of a caring family.
Every year, CCAI selects a small group of out-
standing individuals, families, or organizations
across the nation to be recognized as Angels
in Adoption. These honorees have gone
above and beyond to demonstrate their com-
mitment to improving the lives of children in
need of permanent, loving homes.
Madam Speaker, I am so very proud of Mrs.
Yvette DuBose for all the work that she has
done in our community. I wish her the best as
she continues her work to make the dream of
a forever family a realty for so many children
in need.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1392 November 1, 2019
Barnstable as he steps down from the role of
Chief Executive Officer of the Cape Cod Mili-
tary Support Foundation. A former executive
of Sheraton Hotels, Don has not slowed down
in his retirement but has been fueled by his
passion for serving veterans and active mili-
tary personnel and their families. This commit-
ment led him to establish the Cape Cod Mili-
tary Support Foundation in 2014.
In his work, Don has recognized that chil-
dren of deployed military personnel often feel
their absence most dearly during the holidays
and at other milestone moments. Therefore,
he started Operation Backpack, to supply mili-
tary children with back-to-school supplies, a
holiday gift-giving program, and other holiday-
themed events. In addition, the Foundation of-
fers emergency and food assistance to military
families, as well as nursery supplies for babies
and toddlers. The families of Joint Base Cape
Cod benefit from these programs through the
Family Empowerment Center located on the
base, Don’s labor of love that opened in 2018.
His work through the foundation was espe-
cially vital to Coast Guard families during the
recent government shutdown.
In 20l7, Don was recognized as a Difference
Maker of the Year by the New England Patri-
ots. He has been honored by the United
States Coast Guard, the Massachusetts Na-
tional Guard, and the American Red Cross for
his work on behalf of military families. As he
steps down from his role as Executive Director
of the Cape Cod Military Support Foundation,
the legacy of his work will continue as it ex-
tends to serve military families across Massa-
chusetts and indeed the nation.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor Don-
ald A. Cox for his dedication to serving our
military and veterans’ families. I ask that my
colleagues join me in thanking him for all of
his incredible work and wishing him all the
best as he continues to support our service
members and their families.

RECOGNIZING CLIFFORD H. LONG,
CHAIRMAN OF THE EMERALD
COAST MILITARY AFFAIRS
COUNCIL
HON. MATT GAETZ
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 1, 2019
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, today I rise to
recognize Mr. Clifford Long, Chairman of the
Emerald Coast Military Affairs Council. Mr.
Long served the area in this role since 2007.
In 1998, the Fort Walton Beach Chamber of
Commerce bestowed a special ‘‘President’s
Award’’ upon him to recognize his many years
of dedication to the Military Affairs Council and
Florida’s military mission.
Mr. Long contributed his expertise and guid-
ance in many different capacities. He served
as Chairman of the Greater Fort Walton
Beach Chamber of Commerce Military Affairs
Council from 1989 to 2007 and as chamber
president from 1971 to 1972. Mr. Long also
served on the Board of Directors for the
Okaloosa County Economic Development
Council’s Defense Support Initiative.
His life was lived in service to our commu-
nity, serving as liaison and support between
local business and the military community. He
was a strong advocate for the region’s military
presence, and worked diligently with the high-
est levels of Air Force leadership. He dedi-
cated his life to contributing to the growth of
the defense presence in Northwest Florida,
and advocating for military officers. He was a
true patriot.
In 2002, Mr. Long was awarded the Air
Force Association ‘‘Civilian of the Year’’ award
at their annual conference recognizing his out-
standing efforts and dedication to the military
and its mission. That same year, he was
named a ‘‘Life Director’’ of the Greater Fort
Walton Beach Chamber of Commerce, recog-
nizing the many years he dedicated to the
growth and development of the chamber and
the local area.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United
States Congress, it is my honor to recognize
Mr. Clifford H. Long, and his life of service to
Northwest Florida. I thank him for his impact
on our community, and send my deepest con-
dolences to his entire family.

HONORING REVEREND WILLIE F.
WILSON
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 1, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask the House of Representatives to join
me in honoring one of our nation’s foremost
liberation theologians, the Reverend Willie F.
Wilson, Pastor of the Union Temple Baptist, in
our nation’s capital. Reverend Wilson has de-
voted his life and ministry to uplifting, enhanc-
ing and empowering the lives of the down-
trodden and to fighting for the dignity, justice
and liberation of all people.
Over the years, thousands have responded
to the power of Reverend Wilson’s preaching
and exhortation to ‘‘unchain your mind’’
through examining and reclaiming Jesus
Christ, the truth of African-American history
and learning to love ourselves as well as oth-
ers. As a result, Union Temple’s membership
has grown from the initial 25 faithful members
to more than 8,000.
Reverend Wilson has served the Union
Temple Baptist Church and the District of Co-
lumbia community faithfully for 46 years. His
impact on the church is immeasurable. As he
passes the torch of leadership to his daughter,
Reverend Dr. Anika Wilson Brown, we wel-
come her and thank Reverend Wilson for his
steadfast work.
Reverend Wilson, born in Newport News,
Virginia, received a bachelor’s degree in jour-
nalism from Ohio University. He became a
D.C. resident in 1969 and received a master’s
degree from Howard University School of Di-
vinity.
Under his leadership, the Union Temple
Baptist Church achieved an array of firsts, in-
cluding the first substance abuse ministry
based in a D.C. church; the first African-Amer-
ican church-led Rites of Passage program to
support adolescents in transitioning from child-
hood to adulthood; the introduction of
Kwanzaa Celebration as part of faith ministry;
the first ordination of women into Baptist min-
istry regionally; and the promotion of interfaith
worship between Christians and Orthodox
Muslims. The church invested millions of dol-
lars in the development of affordable housing,
home ownership and financial literacy pro-
grams, as well as in youth development and
health promotion activities.
Social service programs have flourished at
the Union Temple Baptist Church, including
the Akoma project, which provides case man-
agement to individuals living with HIV/AIDS;
the AYA Program, a D.C. Department of
Human Services-funded program providing
counseling, job development and placement
services to assist people moving from welfare
to work; and the Village Keepers Homeless
Outreach Ministry, which provides shelter for
homeless individuals in D.C.—to name only a
few.
The Union Temple Baptist Church has
erected a home in Ghana, West Africa for its
Rites of Passage programs. The church has
donated over one million dollars in medical
supplies to the hospital in Asankrangwa and
sponsors an adopt-a-child educational pro-
gram. Ordained a Wolof Priest in Gambia,
Reverend Wilson’s ministry and practice are
African-centric, focusing on the African influ-
ence on Christianity. His most recent book,
Birth of the Bible, is a commentary on ‘‘African
spiritual traditions borrowed, stolen, misappro-
priated and modified to produce the book that
we know today as the Bible.’’
Reverend Wilson’s work has not gone unno-
ticed. In 2018, Reverend Wilson was inducted
into the Hall of Fame of the Civil Rights Move-
ment in Selma, Alabama. He was recognized
in 1986 by USA Today ‘‘as one of the 10 most
valuable people in America.’’ In 1995, he was
asked to join the historic Million Man March as
a national organizer, and, in 1997, he received
the Presidential Service Award from President
Bill Clinton.
Reverend Wilson is the father of four chil-
dren and is married to Reverend Mary Lewis
Wilson. He has served on the board of trust-
ees of the University of the District of Colum-
bia. Reverend Wilson has dedicated his life to
a creative, innovative ministry to uplift human-
ity. He has a deep abiding love for all people
and is a passionate voice for truth, justice and
equality for the citizens of D.C. and every-
where.
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in honoring Reverend
Willie F. Wilson for his dedication to freedom
and justice for all, and to the well-being and
faith of District of Columbia residents. We rec-
ognize him for the profound impact his vision
and his work has had on others.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF MR. WILFRED GEORGE PER-
KINS
HON. DOUG LAMBORN
OF COLORADO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 1, 2019
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life and legacy of Mr.
Wilfred George Perkins, a cherished family
man, business owner, and faith leader. Mr.
Perkins, a lifelong Colorado resident and pillar
of the Pikes Peak region passed away on Oc-
tober 19, 2019, at the age of ninety-one.
Will was born in Montrose, Colorado. After
graduating from Colorado College in 1949, he
married the love of his life, Bessie Lea Has-
tings, in 1950. Their remarkable sixty-nine
years of marriage produced children, Pamela
(Ted) Walker, Tom (Cheryl) Perkins, Karen
(Jeff) Sheets, and Sandra (Bentley) Tate,
along with fourteen grandchildren and eight-
een great-grandchildren.
Mr. Perkins was a second-generation auto-
mobile enthusiast and salesman. Will owned
and operated Perkins Motors from 1958 to
1985. He also served two terms as the presi-
dent of the Chrysler National Dealer Council.
Will was highly regarded in the business
world. He was a role model for his peers and
community leaders around the state and the
nation. Even competitors admired Will’s hum-
ble attitude and spiritual consistency. Upon re-
tiring, Mr. Perkins passed the family business
on to his son, Tom, and later his grandson,
David.
Will’s public testimony to the power of the
Gospel was bold, clear, and compelling. If
there was one thing that Will hung his hat on,
it was that he was a faithful follower of Jesus
Christ. He wanted people to know about the
life they could have if they would open up their
hearts to the Lord. He generously supported
numerous ministries, including: The Naviga-
tors, Young Life, Springs Rescue Mission,
International Students, Inc., and Focus on the
Family. Will and Bessie attended Village
Seven Presbyterian Church for forty-seven
years. Will faithfully sang in the church choir
and encouraged fellow believers to become
engaged in their communities, whether it be
politically or spiritually.
Mr. Perkins truly made the culture of the 5th
Congressional District as beautiful as our nat-
ural surroundings. The Colorado Front Range
has lost a Christian statesman, but we will
benefit from Will’s legacy for generations to
come.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF
THOMAS HANIE PARIS, JR.
HON. DOUG COLLINS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 1, 2019
Mr. COLLINS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the life and legacy of Thomas Hanie
Paris, Jr.
Tom Paris, Jr. was born and raised in
Gainesville, Georgia. While attending Gaines-
ville High School, Tom was elected class
president and captain of the football team
where he earned All-State and All-American
honors. After graduating from high school,
Tom went on to play college football at the
University of Georgia where he earned his
bachelor’s degree in business administration
and was inducted into both Phi Kappa Phi and
Beta Gamma Sigma Honor Societies, all while
being a three-year letterman.
After graduating from college, Tom joined
the family business of Paris-Dunlap Wholesale
Hardware Company, serving as the company’s
president. Building on his success at Paris-
Dunlap, Tom founded Paris Management and
Investment Company and Paris Storage Com-
pany.
Tom was often recognized for his success
in business, but above all else, he will be re-
membered for his devotion to his community.
Tom worked to advance numerous organiza-
tions throughout Hall County, serving as direc-
tor of the Gainesville-Hall Chamber of Com-
merce, president of the Gainesville Rotary
Club, a founding trustee of Lakeview Acad-
emy, a trustee of both Brenau University and
the Northeast Georgia Health System board,
and a faithful member of Gainesville First
United Methodist Church, among many other
roles.
Even after his passing, Tom Paris, Jr. con-
tinued to move our community forward by rais-
ing funds in his memory to renovate the Hu-
mane Society of Northeast Georgia, which he
served as a board member for over nine
years. We were reminded of his legacy earlier
this week as the Humane Society held its rib-
bon cutting ceremony for the Paris Family Sur-
gery Suite. The remodeled surgery suite hon-
ors Tom’s wish that the Humane Society of
Northeast Georgia renovate the surgery suite
to provide the most up-to-date care and tech-
nology for the animals of Northeast Georgia.
Because of Tom and the funds for this renova-
tion, the Humane Society’s lifesaving spay and
neuter work will continue for decades to come.
Tom will always be remembered as a
steady leader in our community, but first and
foremost, he was a devoted son, brother, hus-
band, father and grandfather. On behalf of the
people of Northeast Georgia, I hope you will
join Tom’s beloved family in celebrating his re-
markable life.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE
OF CONGRESSMAN JOHN CONYERS
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 1, 2019
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor the extraordinary life and
service of the late Rep. John Conyers, the
longest serving African American in Congress,
a founding member of the Congressional
Black Caucus and the former Dean of the
House.
During his more than 50 years in the House
of Representatives, Rep. Conyers built a rep-
utation as a champion for civil, human and
voting rights. He was relentless: Just four days
after the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was
killed, Rep. Conyers introduced the first bill to
create a federal holiday honoring him. Fifteen
years later, he finally got it over the finish line
when President Reagan signed it into law in
1983.
Rep. Conyers spent his life advocating for
those who often did not have a seat at the
table. He helped spearhead landmark reforms
including the original passage and several ex-
tensions of the Voting Rights Act, as well as
passage of the Violence Against Women Act
of 1994 and the Hate Crimes Act of 2009. In
2002, Rep. Conyers successfully pushed for
the Help America Vote Act, legislation that
made sweeping improvements to voting sys-
tems and voter access.
On a personal note, Rep. Conyers also had
ties to my hometown of Selma, Alabama,
where he led a voter registration drive in Feb-
ruary 1965, just one month before the Bloody
Sunday Selma to Montgomery march. Rep.
Conyers was in his first year in Congress, but
Dr. King said his ‘‘very presence there has
had an electric effect upon the voteless and
beleaguered Negro citizens of this city, county,
state and nation.’’
Rep. Conyers never waivered in his stead-
fast support of his beloved Detroit and those
he served. May he rest in peace.
DIRECTING CERTAIN COMMITTEES
TO CONTINUE ONGOING INVES-
TIGATIONS INTO WHETHER SUF-
FICIENT GROUNDS EXIST FOR
THE IMPEACHMENT OF DONALD
JOHN TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES
SPEECH OF
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, October 31, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, to its cred-
it, the House is demonstrating the seriousness
of steps that could lead to the impeachment of
a president. In my judgment, shameful
breaches of conduct (and Trump has com-
mitted many), such as President Clinton’s af-
fair with Monica Lewinsky, were not impeach-
able because official duties were not impli-
cated. For impeachment, the Constitution re-
quires ‘‘high Crimes and Misdemeanors.’’ An
affair with an intern is disgraceful, not criminal.
The people are ahead of the Congress on
impeaching this President, or at least on the
inquiry we formalize, if consistent indications
from polls can be counted as evidence. The
House is taking the right step in ratifying the
inquiry process that will lead to the necessary
open hearings.
As a member of the Oversight and Reform
Committee, I have been sitting in on closed
hearings from witnesses whose testimony is
part of the prescribed process. The pros-
ecutor, the House, is conducting an inquiry,
which is like a grand jury proceeding or a U.S.
Attorney investigation to determine if there has
been a violation of law. These procedures are
always closed to protect the innocent parties
in case the decision is made that there is not
enough evidence to move forward. So far, wit-
nesses have come forward to corroborate evi-
dence indicating that Trump used his office as
president to seek ‘‘a favor,’’ an investigation of
his most prominent opponent in the forth-
coming election, by a foreign power who had
life or death dependence on the appropriated
U.S. funds.
Was there an attempt made to hold security
funding hostage to the president’s concern
about a political rival? If this question is
deemed not to be worthy of the inquiry—in-
vestigation—we authorize today, it would be
difficult to ever again define any conduct that
deserves an impeachment inquiry.

IN RECOGNITION OF STEPHEN
MARCUS
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 1, 2019
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in recognition of the career and advocacy of
Stephen Marcus as he is named 2019 Man of
the Year by the Crohn’s and Colitis Founda-
tion.
At a young age Stephen was diagnosed
with ulcerative colitis. Years later, he would
also be diagnosed with Crohn’s Disease.
Rather than live quietly with these invisible
diseases, Stephen chose to advocate for
those who share his diagnosis.
In 2010, Stephen, along with his son Jake,
formed Team Intestinal Fortitude. Since its in-
ception, Team Intestinal Fortitude has raised
more than 1.2 million dollars for those who
suffer from inflammatory bowel diseases.
Later in 2012, Stephen became President of
the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America’s
New England Chapter. While President he
spearheaded the campaign to pass Massa-
chusetts’ Restroom Access Act. This law re-
quires public establishments to grant a cus-
tomer with eligible medical conditions access
to the facilities on premise regardless of store
policy. This important legislation helped raise
awareness and give dignity to those who suf-
fer from IBD. More recently, he has become
head of the chapter’s advocacy committee,
where he is committed to working to combat
unnecessary and reductive barriers between
patients and their insurance companies.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor the
necessary work of Stephen Marcus and offer
my sincere gratitude for his dedication to im-
proving the lives of those suffering from IBD.
I ask that my colleagues join me in thanking
him for his service and wishing him all the
best in the years to come.

DIRECTING CERTAIN COMMITTEES
TO CONTINUE ONGOING INVES-
TIGATIONS INTO WHETHER SUF-
FICIENT GROUNDS EXIST FOR
THE IMPEACHMENT OF DONALD
JOHN TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES
SPEECH OF
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, October 31, 2019
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H. Res. 660.
This is only the fourth time in its 230-year
history, the House of Representatives is voting
to authorize a public inquiry into whether to
exercise one of the most solemn responsibil-
ities of Congress: impeachment of the Presi-
dent of the United States.
Under the Constitution, the criteria for im-
peachment and removal from office are ‘‘trea-
son, bribery, or other high crimes and mis-
demeanors.’’ While the Constitution does not
define the scope of ‘‘high crime and mis-
demeanors,’’ Alexander Hamilton wrote in the
Federalist Papers that impeachable offenses
are those that arise ‘‘from the abuse or viola-
tion of some public trust’’ and ‘‘relate chiefly to
injuries done immediately to the society itself.’’
The House determined in 1988 that high
crimes and misdemeanors are not necessarily
criminal acts but rather ‘‘misconduct that dam-
ages the state and the operation of govern-
ment institutions.’’
Last month, a whistle blower alleged that
the President had used the power of his office
to solicit interference from a foreign country in
the 2020 election by withholding congression-
ally approved security assistance for Ukraine
to coerce them to investigate a political oppo-
nent. If true, these allegations are impeach-
able offenses that threaten the very core of
our system of government.
What we have learned since our inquiry
began on September 24th is deeply troubling.
Numerous government officials, both political
appointees and career diplomats, have testi-
fied under oath how the President’s personal
lawyer ran a shadow foreign policy to benefit
the President’s reelection at the expense of le-
gitimate foreign policy objectives.
With today’s resolution, the House will move
into the public phase of the inquiry. The Reso-
lution ensures a fair and transparent process
that allows the Majority and the Minority equal
time to question witnesses and permits the
President’s attorneys to present their case,
question witnesses, and make requests for ad-
ditional evidence or testimony. These protec-
tions are the same or greater than the ones
provided to Presidents Nixon and Clinton dur-
ing the inquiries into their behavior.
I don’t take today’s vote lightly because I
served in Congress during the impeachment
of President Clinton. I know firsthand how divi-
sive impeachment can be. However, our de-
mocracy cannot function under these cir-
cumstances, and my oath to defend the Con-
stitution calls me to support this inquiry.
When Benjamin Franklin was asked whether
the newly drafted Constitution established a
monarchy or a republic, he replied ‘‘a Repub-
lic, if you can keep it.’’ Each generation of
Americans is called to uphold the principles of
self-governance, and when those we elect to
public office violate our laws and our Constitu-
tion, faith in our democracy erodes.
I urge my colleagues to vote for this resolu-
tion so the American people can hear first-
hand how the President abused the power of
his office to solicit interference from a foreign
country in the 2020 election. My oath of office
is to preserve, protect, and defend the Con-
stitution of the United States, and I will con-
tinue to do everything I can to live up to this
sacred pledge and keep the republic the
Founding Fathers built for us.
