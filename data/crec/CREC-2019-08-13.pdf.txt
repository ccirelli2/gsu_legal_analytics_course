PAYING TRIBUTE TO LEGENDARY
BOXER EMANUEL ‘‘MANNY’’
STEWARD
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 13, 2019
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
pay tribute to the memory of Emanuel
‘‘Manny’’ Steward, a legend in the sport of
boxing.
After moving to Detroit from Virginia as an
adolescent, Steward became interested in
boxing, training at Detroit’s Brewster Recre-
ation Center before moving on to Kronk Gym.
Over the years, he honed his skills as an
amateur boxer, but is most well known for his
career as one of boxing’s most successful
coaches. Steward trained countless athletes,
including Hilmer Kenty, his first world cham-
pion, and most famously, Thomas ‘‘The
Hitman’’ Hearn. Over the course of his career,
Steward trained 41 world champions, and as
further testament to his coaching skills, his
heavyweights accumulated a remarkable
record of 34–2–1 in title fights. Steward’s work
brought world renown to Kronk Gym and se-
cured Detroit’s reputation as an incubator for
up and coming boxers.
Emanuel Steward embodied the true spirit
of Detroit—determination, grit, and success
through hard work. It is with great honor that
I ask you to join with me in honor of his mem-
ory and upon the dedication of a street named
to recognize his remarkable life and many ac-
complishments.

NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGE
VITALIZATION ACT
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO
SABLAN
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 13, 2019
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Native American Language Vital-
ization Act, which would help preserve the in-
digenous languages of the United States
through grants to postsecondary institutions to
support Native American language education
programs and the pipeline of language instruc-
tors.
Native American languages are part of our
nation’s cultural heritage and are as diverse
as the rich cultures of American Indians, Alas-
ka Natives, Native Hawaiians and the Native
peoples of the Pacific U.S. territories. Over the
course of our nation’s history, Native Ameri-
cans have faced discrimination and govern-
ment policies that restricted or banned the use
of their indigenous languages. These policies
have contributed to the decline in speakers of
Native American languages. Without action,
many of these languages, from Chamorro to
Refaluwasch to Cherokee, are at risk of dis-
appearing. Congress recognized this urgency
in passing the Esther Martinez Act in 2006 to
strengthen Native American language immer-
sion programs. However, we must do more at
the postsecondary level so that future genera-
tions have the programs and quality instruc-
tors necessary to not only preserve but in-
crease the use of their ancestral languages.
The Native American Language Vitalization
Act invests in indigenous language education
by creating a dedicated grant program under
the Higher Education Act to provide the re-
sources Native-serving colleges and univer-
sities need to develop or strengthen their in-
digenous language programs. Schools can
use the grant to provide in-service training for
language teachers, develop curriculum, pro-
fessional development of faculty, and create
innovative programs, including language im-
mersion. Eligible institutions can also partner
with other organizations to reach students in
early childhood education programs through
grade 12.
I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion to help preserve the indigenous lan-
guages of the United States for future genera-
tions.

ASSYRIAN MEMORIAL DAY
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 13, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor the memory of the Assyrian people. On
the occasion of Assyrian Memorial Day, we
pay our respects to and remember those As-
syrians who have lost their lives to genocide
and persecution.
The Assyrian people have faced systematic
persecution from the early 20th century to the
present day. From 1915 to 1918, 750,000
men, women, and children of Assyrian de-
scent were killed under the Ottoman Empire,
while still hundreds of thousands more be-
came homeless and stateless refugees. In the
Simele Massacre on August 7, 1933, 3,000
Assyrians were killed at the hands of the then-
government of Iraq. In recent years, ISIS com-
mitted a brutal genocide against religious and
ethnic minorities, including Assyrians, killing
thousands of people.
We will ensure these tragedies are never
forgotten. I would like to recognize New York
State Assemblyman Nader Sayegh for his
work in highlighting the valuable contributions
that members of the Assyrian-American com-
munity have made in my state and across the
country. We must recall the commitment of the
United States to promoting freedom and
human rights for all people regardless of their
national, religious, or ethnic identity and re-
main steadfast in our conviction. We must
continue to speak out against injustice every-
where and contribute to a world in which all
people can live without fear of genocide or
persecution.
CONGRATULATING KEITH
SULTEMEIER
HON. TED LIEU
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 13, 2019
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to congratulate Keith Sultemeier on
his recent election to the Board of Directors at
the National Association of Federally-Insured
Credit Unions (NAFCU).
Since April of 2012, Mr. Sultemeier has
served as the President and Chief Executive
Officer of Kinecta Federal Credit Union (FCU).
Kinecta FCU is headquartered in Manhattan
Beach, California, in my congressional district.
It has over $4.4 billion in assets and over
300,000 members.
With more than 25 years of experience in
the financial services industry, Mr.
Sultemeier’s deep understanding of the legis-
lative and regulatory issues facing credit
unions will provide tremendous expertise to
the NAFCU Board.
Mr. Sultemeier holds Master of Business
Administration and Bachelor of Business Ad-
ministration degrees from the University of
Texas at Austin. He is also a Certified Public
Accountant.
I wish Mr. Sultemeier well in his new role on
the NAFCU Board and I ask that my col-
leagues join me today in congratulating him on
this exceptional achievement.

RECOGNIZING PASTOR ROBERT
BROWNLEE, SR.
HON. TRENT KELLY
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 13, 2019
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize Pastor Robert
Brownlee, Sr. of Louisville, Mississippi.
On August 25, Pastor Brownlee will be cele-
brating 30 years in the Gospel Ministry. Pastor
Brownlee currently serves at Agape Baptist
Church in Louisville, Mississippi. He previously
served at Union Chapel Mission Baptist
Church in Louisville, Mississippi, New Zion
Church in Houston, Mississippi, and Bluff
Creek Church in Phoebe, Mississippi.
During his 30 years, Pastor Brownlee has
done incredible things for the state. He led his
community through Helping Hand Ministries,
participated in health fairs, clothing drives, dis-
aster recovery, mentored the youth, organized
summer feeding programs, led jailhouse min-
istry, and led foreign mission trips.
Pastor Brownlee is a husband, father, and
friend to many. I thank him for his many years
of service, and I pray that God continues to
bless and work through him.

INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO RE-
QUIRE THE DIRECTOR OF THE
COURT SERVICES AND OF-
FENDER SUPERVISION AGENCY
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUM-
BIA AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PRE-
TRIAL SERVICES AGENCY TO RE-
SIDE IN THE DISTRICT OF CO-
LUMBIA
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 13, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today I in-
troduced a bill to require the Directors of the
Court Services and Offender Supervision
Agency for the District of Columbia (CSOSA)
and the District of Columbia Pretrial Services
Agency (PSA) to reside in the District of Co-
lumbia during their tenure.
CSOSA is an independent federal agency
that supervises offenders only in D.C. PSA is
an independent agency within CSOSA that su-
pervises defendants only in D.C. This bill
would not apply to those already in office upon
enactment.
Congress has justifiably required that certain
federal officials live in the jurisdiction they
serve to ensure in-depth knowledge of the
unique issues and challenges residents and
these federal officials face, but federal officials
serving the District are not required to do so.
This patronizing leftover from when the District
was governed by the federal government has
real effects on residents. There is no reason
that the Directors of CSOSA and PSA, federal
agencies that uniquely serve D.C. residents,
should not be required to live in the District,
engage with local communities and work
closely with local officials. Adding residency
requirements for federal officials serving the
District is a matter of fairness for the residents
they serve.
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this
legislation.

HONORING THE LIFE OF PAUL
FINDLEY
HON. DARIN LaHOOD
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 13, 2019
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I would like
to honor and remember the life of Congress-
man Paul Findley, who passed away on Au-
gust 9, 2019, at age 98.
Born in Jacksonville, Illinois, in 1921, Con-
gressman Findley displayed a natural gravita-
tion towards public service. Congressman Fin-
dley graduated from Illinois College in 1943.
After finishing his schooling, Congressman
Findley served in the Pacific Theater during
World War II, as a commissioned officer in the
United States Navy.
Following Congressman Findley’s service to
our country, he returned to Illinois to become
the editor and publisher of the Pike Press, in
Pittsfield, Illinois. In 1960, Mr. Findley was
elected to represent the 20th Congressional
District of Illinois in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. Mr. Findley served eleven terms
in Congress.
While he was a Member of Congress, Mr.
Findley served on the Agriculture Committee
and the Foreign Affairs Committee. During his
time in Washington, Congressman Findley
was known for his outspoken support of civil
rights legislation, and as a strong advocate for
agriculture in our country.
We mourn the passing of Congressman Fin-
dley, a friend and hero to many. He left a last-
ing impact on those who had the pleasure of
knowing him.

VETERAN OF THE MONTH
HON. KEVIN HERN
OF OKLAHOMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 13, 2019
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Madam
Speaker, today I honor the First District of
Oklahoma’s August Veteran of the Month, Of-
ficer Stacy Hester.
Stacy Hester served as a Military Intel-
ligence Officer for 8 years of active duty in the
United States Marine Corps. Additionally, Offi-
cer Hester has done remarkable work in our
community for veterans.
Since being out of the Marines, Officer Hes-
ter has found a passion for advocating and
helping veterans. He’s developed best prac-
tice, veteran-specific programs at the local,
state, and national level, including Justice For
Vets, the largest advancing justice for vet-
erans organization in the world. Also, he owns
and operates a business, 3C Concepts, which
stands for Connect-Communicate-Community.
The mission of his business is to help vet-
erans transition back into their communities
through the 3C application.
Officer Hester is also the co-founder of the
Eagle Ops Foundation, along with fellow Ma-
rine Jonathan Shepherd—our July Veteran of
the Month—and his wife, Jessica. In 2018,
they launched Eagle Ops as an outreach pro-
gram for veterans and their families, with the
focus on community.
I am thankful for Officer Hester’s faithful
commitment to helping veterans in our com-
munity and across the country. Officer Hester
plays an essential role in our community of
veterans, and I’m glad to have this opportunity
to recognize him as our August Veteran of the
Month. His service to our country and impact
within our community is one that will last for-
ever.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE HARVEYS
LAKE PROTECTIVE ASSOCIATION
HON. DANIEL MEUSER
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 13, 2019
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is with
great appreciation that I rise today to recog-
nize and honor the Harveys Lake Protective
Association on its 100 years of service.
Northeast Pennsylvania is home to an abun-
dance of natural beauty, and chief among the
many natural treasures found in the Ninth Dis-
trict is Harveys Lake in Luzerne County. For a
century now, the Harveys Lake Protective As-
sociation (HLPA) has been a faithful steward
of this lake, ensuring it remains a place where
friends and families can enjoy and continue to
make memories that will last a lifetime.
We owe a great deal of gratitude to HLPA
for conserving the lake, establishing local
emergency services, and preserving this
peaceful spot in our great Commonwealth. A
1920 record from the Association’s meeting
reads, ‘‘Nature has given us, in the lake, a
most beautiful spot for a summer home. By
working together through our Association, we
can prevent many things which would tend to
mar its attractiveness and can accomplish
much in the making it a better place at which
to live.’’ A testament to HLPA’s dedicated ef-
forts, Harveys Lake has retained its beauty
every summer and in every season.
On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives and the citizens of Pennsylvania’s Ninth
Congressional District, I extend my sincerest
gratitude to HLPA as we celebrate its centen-
nial anniversary. This great milestone serves
as a reminder of all the great work HLPA has
done over the last 100 years and the good
work it will continue to do to preserve this gem
for the next 100 years and beyond.

Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, today I rise in

Florida, a constituent who recently retired after
thirty-six years of working at the Kennedy
Space Center as an air traffic controller, and,
most recently as a lead contractor for the
Washington Consulting Group.
Ronald Feile began his aviation career in

1970 through November 1971. In 1971, he be-
came control chief of combined tower and
radar facility and was placed in charge of
training personnel and scheduling logistical
supply which was vital to our operation in Viet-
nam. He also served as flight operations liai-
son to the South Vietnamese army and
earned the Army Commendation Medal.
Following his military service and service as
an air traffic controller with the FAA, Ron was
recruited to work on our space program at the
Cape serving as the lead Air Traffic Controller
for the Shuttle Landing Facility and the Military
Radar Unit. In that role, Ron was intimately in-
volved with our Shuttle program, coordinating
air and ground support for Shuttle launch and
landing events. He also provided his expertise
for major satellite and launch payload deliv-
eries.
Throughout his career, Ron has been
awarded NASA’s Silver Snoopy Award and
NASA’s Space Flight Awareness Award. He
was also interviewed by NASA as part of its
oral history of the Shuttle program. In addition
to these honors, he will receive the highest
tribute for those in aviation history. Ronald
Feile’s name will be inscribed in the wall of the
Air and Space Museum. Ron’s name will join
the names of Buzz Aldrin, the Wright Brothers,
Charles Lindberg, John Glenn, Ameila Earhart,
and countless other pioneers of our aviation
history.
Having worked on our nation’s space pro-
gram as a young man, I have come to know
many of the great Americans like Ron who
have dedicated their lives to serving our nation
and making our space program so successful.
I ask Members of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives to join me and Ron’s family,
friends, and colleagues at the Washington
Consulting Group in recognizing his work and
contribution to America’s mission in space.

HONORING WAYNE, MICHIGAN’S
SESQUICENTENNIAL
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, August 13, 2019
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the city of Wayne, Michigan as its
residents celebrate the city’s one hundred fif-
tieth anniversary.
Wayne, Michigan was first incorporated in
1869, but its roots can be traced even further
back as a trading post by the indigenous Pota-
watomi. With its prime location along the trad-
ing route, and in close proximity to the River
Rouge, the area grew in population, securing
the settlement’s role in Michigan’s manufac-
turing economy. Glass, carriage, and eventu-
ally automobile manufacturing.
Modern day Wayne, Michigan is a thriving,
friendly community. Its seventeen public parks
are enjoyed by families and nature lovers
alike, and its historic downtown area is the
perfect backdrop for numerous community
events like Wayne Days, Family Fest, and an-
nual community-wide flea market. The City of
Wayne, Michigan has a long history, and its
pride in traditional values of friendship and
hard work are evident today.
Please join me in tribute to the City of
Wayne, Michigan on the occasion of its one
hundred fiftieth anniversary.
