HONORING MAJOR GENERAL
CAROL TIMMONS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Delaware (Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER) for 5
minutes.
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my
colleagues, Senator TOM CARPER and
Senator CHRIS COONS of Delaware, to
honor and congratulate Major General
Carol Timmons for a lifetime of dedi-
cated service to our country.
After graduating from William Penn
High School in 1977, Timmons enrolled
in college and enlisted in the Delaware
National Guard. With a childhood
dream of becoming an airline pilot, her
career in flight would begin that very
summer on a C–130 airplane in Savan-
nah, Georgia.
Despite her love of airplanes, Air
Force rules prevented women from fly-
ing combat mission planes like the C–
130. Due to these unfair regulations,
she joined the Army National Guard in
1980 and would learn to fly noncombat
Army helicopters like the UH–1 Huey.
Undeterred and committed to her
dream, Timmons joined the Air Force
Reserves, where she flew noncombat
support missions. She soon realized her
dream as Federal laws ended the dis-
criminatory prohibition on women fly-
ing in combat missions, and during Op-
eration Desert Storm, then-Captain
Timmons would become one of the first
women to fly in combat.
Following that operation, her career
would come full circle as she rejoined
the Delaware National Guard, flying
the same C–130s she learned to fly on
and to operate in the beginning.
On January 8, 2012, then-Brigadier
General Timmons would make history
by becoming the Delaware Air National
Guard’s first female commander, and
again on February 1, 2017, when she was
promoted to the rank of major general
and made Adjutant General of the
Delaware National Guard, the Gov-
ernor’s chief military adviser, com-
manding 1,500 soldiers and 1,100 airmen.
During her storied 42-year career, she
earned a Bronze Star for her service in
Afghanistan and has flown over 5,200
hours in the cockpit, including 400
combat hours during contingencies
spanning from Operations Desert
Shield to Inherent Resolve. She served
on the National Guard’s Joint Diver-
sity Executive Council and the Air
Force Reserve Policy Committee. She
has received numerous honors, includ-
ing induction into the Delaware Avia-
tion Hall of Fame and the Delaware
Women’s Hall of Fame.
By refusing to compromise on her
dream, Timmons broke down barriers,
blazed trails, and inspired women to let
nothing stand in their way in service
to our Nation.
I join Senator CARPER and Senator
COONS in thanking Major General Carol
Timmons for her over four decades of
service to our State and our country,
and we wish her the very best.
f
NATIONAL EMERGENCY
DECLARATION
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Washington (Mrs. RODGERS of Wash-
ington) for 5 minutes.
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to discuss the
President’s national emergency dec-
laration.
First and foremost, I support Presi-
dent Trump, and I support the wall.
Walls work to protect our security,
combat human trafficking, stop the
flow of drugs, and encourage legal im-
migration.
Democrats have pushed for zero wall
money, open borders, and abolishing
ICE. These policies make our Nation
vulnerable and threaten our security,
and it is a tragedy.
So I don’t blame the President for
proposing extreme measures to respond
to their extreme policies and tactics.
However, yesterday, I made the dif-
ficult decision to disapprove of this
type of unilateral executive action,
just as I could not approve any such
unilateral action by any President.
I am 100 percent with President
Trump for building the wall, but the
emergency declaration only maintains
the status quo. Securing our border is
fundamental to who we are as a sov-
ereign nation, and that is why I voted
over a dozen times for stronger border
security, including $25 billion for the
wall last year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2238 February 27, 2019
Unfortunately, as the President rec-
ognized, himself, this national emer-
gency could be tied up in the courts for
years with no guarantee that judges
will rule in favor of the wall to be
built. It is Congress’ job to provide the
resources our Nation needs to keep us
safe, and I am concerned that if this is
tied up in the courts, we will be stuck
with the status quo of no wall and a
border that isn’t secure.
My vote to disapprove of this unilat-
eral executive action had nothing to do
with the merits or need to build Presi-
dent Trump’s wall; it was about our
Constitution and this body’s exclusive
Article I powers to make laws and use
the power of the purse.
I spoke out strongly when President
Obama said that if Congress didn’t act,
he would use the pen and the phone,
and then he proceeded to act alone on
DACA and act alone in reappropriating
money within ObamaCare and regu-
lating every mud puddle in America.
Remember, President Obama ini-
tially said he couldn’t act alone on
DACA because he wasn’t a king or an
emperor. After a robust debate in Con-
gress, he flip-flopped and took execu-
tive action. His executive action took
away Congress’ authority to act, and
DACA still isn’t solved.
These unilateral actions by President
Obama put more power in the hands of
unelected people sitting in cubicles in
Washington, D.C., and they turned
elected Representatives into elected
bystanders. When Representatives be-
come irrelevant, citizens become irrel-
evant, and we the people are powerless
against faceless, unelected bureau-
crats.
Unilateral executive actions set bad
precedent. If it is okay for the execu-
tive branch to act alone after the legis-
lative branch doesn’t reach an agree-
ment, where does that take us?
Governor Jay Inslee already has said
that he would be willing to declare a
national emergency on climate change
allowing for drastic Federal action
that would never have to be approved
by Congress.
What if, without any congressional
approval, a future President used a na-
tional emergency to take money from
our VA clinics, Fairchild Air Force
Base, or force management at the
Colville National Forest to force a
Green New Deal on the American peo-
ple?
Whether it is at the border or uphold-
ing the separation of powers in our
Constitution, we, conservative Repub-
licans, must be consistent about being
the party for the rule of law. It is those
principles that define us.
Mr. Speaker, I say to Speaker
PELOSI: I am 100 percent with Trump
on the wall. I am also 100 percent with
the Constitution. As Representatives of
the people, it is our call to put aside
any personal ambition or partisan di-
vides so that the people are protected.
This isn’t about political parties, per-
sonalities, or power. It never has been.
It is about making sure that the prom-
ise of America is never breached and
knowing that the only ones who can
preserve it are we the people. I take
this seriously and will always lead by
upholding my Article I constitutional
authority to be a strong voice for those
I have the privilege of serving in the
United States House of Representa-
tives.
f
GUN VIOLENCE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
New Jersey (Ms. SHERRILL) for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise
in this Chamber today in support of
H.R. 8.
Americans have been waiting for
Congress to catch up to them. It isn’t
often that we hear that 70, 80, or 90 per-
cent of Americans agree on something,
but when it comes to universal back-
ground checks, 97 percent of Americans
think it is a good idea.
In my own district, I have seen that
unity. After Parkland, we had 13,000
people in Morristown, New Jersey, at
the student-led March for Our Lives de-
manding gun safety legislation. After
the horrific shooting at the Tree of
Life synagogue, members of the com-
munity came together to denounce gun
violence.
The 11th District of New Jersey un-
derstands that universal background
checks are a responsible way to address
the gun violence epidemic in this coun-
try. It is a way to keep our commu-
nities safe.
Here in New Jersey, we know that
successful, responsible gun ownership
looks a lot like the legislation we have
on the books. We have good gun safety
laws, but they are constantly under-
mined by States with weak gun safety
laws.
As a Federal prosecutor, I worked on
cases where we traced illegal guns to
neighboring States with weak gun safe-
ty laws. That is why it is so important
that we have stronger Federal gun
safety laws. Gun violence is a national
problem, and it deserves a national re-
sponse.
Mr. Speaker, I grew up in a culture of
gun safety. My father is a hunter, and
he taught me how to shoot. I went on
to serve in the United States Navy, and
I was qualified as an expert shot in the
M16, the Colt 45, and the 9-millimeter
Beretta.
I am joined today by a fellow fresh-
man veteran, the gentlewoman from
Pennsylvania, and we have been
trained and know the power of these
weapons and the damage that they can
do. Universal background checks are
an easy step that we can take to im-
prove gun safety in this country.
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania (Ms.
HOULAHAN).
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman from New Jer-
sey for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today also in sup-
port of H.R. 8, and I rise to tell the
story of one resident from my commu-
nity, from Pennsylvania’s Sixth Con-
gressional District, Jamie Loeper, and
his parents, Liz and Joe, from West
Chester, Pennsylvania.
Jamie had just graduated college and
was looking for a permanent
postcollege job. In the meantime, he
was working in a pizza shop in West
Philadelphia when his life was trag-
ically cut short in January 2004 when a
worker accidentally shot him. This was
not done in malice but was the result
of a coworker accidentally mishandling
a gun. Jamie passed away when he was
22 years old. Today would have been his
38th birthday.
I rise for the 1,600 Pennsylvanians
and nearly 40,000 Americans who have
lost their lives to gun-related incidents
in 2017 alone.
The Loepers, like mine, are a mili-
tary family. We understand the values
of responsible gun ownership but also
that we must take commonsense steps
to reduce gun violence in our commu-
nities. We have seen for far too long far
too many gun-related tragedies over
the past several years with Congress
doing nothing. We must act now.

SACRAMENTO-SAN JOAQUIN
DELTA NATIONAL HERITAGE
AREA
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. GARAMENDI) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, yes-
terday the House overwhelmingly
passed the Natural Resources Manage-
ment Act, including a provision spon-
sored by Senator FEINSTEIN and me
that would establish California’s first
National Heritage Area, the Sac-
ramento-San Joaquin Delta National
Heritage Area.
I want to thank my House colleagues
from California, Representatives MAT-
SUI, DESAULNIER, MCNERNEY, THOMP-
SON, HARDER, LOFGREN, and BERA, for
their support as cosponsors of the Sac-
ramento-San Joaquin Delta National
Heritage Area Act, H.R. 357.
I also want to thank Chairman GRI-
JALVA of the Natural Resources Com-
mittee for bringing the bipartisan pub-
lic lands bill to the floor of the House
following Senate passage earlier this
month.
I sponsored this legislation to estab-
lish the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta
National Heritage Area since 2011 along
with my colleague Senator FEINSTEIN.
A National Heritage Area designa-
tion will help conserve the California
Delta, which I have had the great
pleasure of calling my home for the
last 40 years.

This iconic working landscape is cen-
tral to California’s life and is the most

local development of cultural heritage
issues, historic preservation, and work-
ing lands conservation projects.
This Federal grant funding will be
available for the next 15 years to sup-
port local governments, historical soci-
eties, and nonprofit organizations
throughout the delta.
Our National Heritage Area Act pro-
posal is endorsed by the Delta Steward-
ship Council and the Delta Counties
Coalition, consisting of Sacramento,
Solano, Contra Costa, Yolo, and San
Joaquin Counties, all of which rep-
resent the delta. It is also supported by
the Delta Chambers of Commerce and
Visitors Bureau, Restore the Delta, and
the National Parks Conservation Asso-
ciation.
California’s Delta Protection Com-
mission is charged with developing the
management plan for the new national
heritage area.
Lastly, I want to address some of the
persistent misconceptions about na-
tional heritage area designations, not
only this new one but also those
throughout the United States. Such
designations do not affect individual
property rights, water rights, land-
ownership, or local land use decisions,
nor does the designation affect hunting
and fishing. Rather, the national herit-
age area program simply makes Fed-
eral grant funds administered by the
National Park Service available for
local projects.
The national heritage area program
and planning process is collaborative
and voluntary, meaning that local
groups, businesses, and landowners can
choose to participate or not. I look for-
ward to continuing to work with local
governments, county governments,
local businesses, communities, local
action groups, and all others interested
during the public management plan-
ning process.
After nearly a decade of work, the
President is expected to sign the Sac-
ramento-San Joaquin Delta National
Heritage Area Act into law. We thank
all who supported the legislation and
the local entities that have done so.
This is truly a historic achievement
for the entire delta, including the
farming communities, the families, and
the immigrant communities who have
settled in the area over the last 150
years and generated the rich cultural
and agricultural heritage.
f
RECOGNIZING ASHLEY AND CHRIS
GASPERI
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5
minutes.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize a family from
Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who is
dedicated to making our world a better
and safer world.
Ashley and Chris Gasperi, ER nurses,
were residents of Feasterville and
worked at Temple University Hospital
and St. Mary Medical Center. Despite
dedicating their careers to caring for
others, they both craved more and
later decided to move to Kenya to es-
tablish a nonprofit organization that
seeks to break the vicious cycle of pov-
erty in rural communities.
Together, they established Ekenywa.
Ekenywa works to dig wells, some-
times hundreds of feet deep, to estab-
lish a reliable water source to commu-
nities and schools in rural Kenya. The
creation of these wells allows for solar-
powered irrigation systems, enabling
communities to farm year-round, even
in the presence of a drought.
Mr. Speaker, I applaud the work of
the Gasperi family and Ekenywa. They
are truly making a difference in the
lives of countless people across the
world.
I speak on behalf of our entire Bucks
County community when we tell them
how much we appreciate their service
and their sacrifice.
RECOGNIZING WALKER ANDERSON FOR HIS
NATIONAL SCIENCE COMPETITION ACHIEVEMENTS
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize a young citizen
in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who
recently was recognized in a national
science competition.
Walker Anderson, a Doylestown resi-
dent and a senior at Central Bucks
West High School, recently won $2,000
as a semifinalist for the Regeneron
Science Talent Search competition.
This recognition was received by only
300 students nationwide and only four
in the State of Pennsylvania.
As impressive as this may be on its
own, this is only one academic achieve-
ment of Walker’s. Walker previously
placed first in the under-18 category at
the World Puzzle Championship in
Prague, competing on the U.S. team,
and was recently accepted into the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Mr. Speaker, I am sure we will hear
of Walker well into the future, as his
STEM research and grasp of complex
mathematical and scientific concepts
is truly remarkable.
I wish Walker and his parents, Susan
and Ken Anderson, all of the best. I
also thank Mark Hayden, Walker’s
STEM Research Club adviser, for his
guidance and his vision.
f
HONORING CIVIL RIGHTS ICON
CLARA LUPER
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Oklahoma (Ms. KENDRA S. HORN) for 5
minutes.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight
the visionary and unwavering leader-
ship of civil rights icon and notable
Oklahoman Ms. Clara Luper.
Six months ago, I got to witness his-
tory as Oklahoma City commemorated
the 60th anniversary of the sit-ins she
organized. I rise today because, even as
a fifth-generation Oklahoman, I real-
ized how little I knew.
Clara Luper and her students sparked
a movement, the sit-ins that led into
our Nation’s civil rights movement.
They deserve to be a household name.
Clara Luper made her mark in a time
when people of color couldn’t even
walk into the front door of Oklahoma
City businesses. They were relegated to
hidden back rooms.
But she had a vision for equality, a
heart for service, and a commitment to
justice. She, in her words, ‘‘believed in
a sun when it didn’t shine and the rain
when it didn’t fall.’’ She knew that
Oklahoma and this country could be a
place where everyone is treated with
respect, dignity, and humanity.
Even as a history teacher at Dunjee
High School in Spencer, Oklahoma, Ms.
Luper instilled those principles in her
students. Her steadfast commitment to
ending racism and systemic discrimi-
nation inspired her to organize Amer-
ica’s first sit-in.
In August 1958, she and 14 of her
NAACP Youth Council students walked
up to a lunch counter they knew would
refuse them, and they ordered a ham-
burger and a Coke. They were denied,
but they did not waver. They knew
what was on the line because, in Ms.
Luper’s words, ‘‘within that hamburger
was the whole essence of democracy.’’
At their own personal peril, they re-
turned each day with more people until
they broke the barrier. It was never
easy. The protesters were verbally and
physically assaulted, and Ms. Luper re-
ceived death threats.
Because of Ms. Luper and her stu-
dents’ fearlessness and determination,
the Katz Drug Stores integrated their
lunch counters, not just in Oklahoma
City but also in Missouri, Kansas, and
Iowa.
When the 1958 sit-in happened in
Oklahoma City, a group of college stu-
dents in North Carolina were inspired
by what had taken place in Oklahoma
City, and they took note. In 1961, those
students launched the Greensboro,
North Carolina, sit-in at the Wool-
worth lunch counter, which fueled mo-
mentum within the civil rights move-
ment.
It didn’t end there. For years, Ms.
Luper and others continued their fight.
The sacrifices continued, too.
Authorities arrested Ms. Luper 26
times during her fight for freedom.
Clara Luper empowered young people
to imagine a future brighter than their
present and taught them how to make
that future a reality.
She changed lives and planted seeds
of ethical leadership into those who
were lucky enough to be mentored by
her. Each of her former students talks
about the pivotal role Ms. Luper played
in instilling confidence, character, and
dignity in them.
Generations reap the benefit of her
sacrifice and efforts to integrate not
only businesses in Oklahoma City but
educational spaces.
Ms. Luper integrated the history de-
partment at the University of Okla-
homa, becoming the first Black grad-
uate of that master’s program. Her
contributions are reflected across our

program at Oklahoma City University,
a corridor on the northeast side of
Oklahoma City, a classroom at the
University of Central Oklahoma, by
the designation of the Oklahoma City
Public Schools District building as The
Clara Luper Center, and naming the
African American studies department
at the University of Oklahoma after
her.
As a lifelong Oklahoman and rep-
resentative of the Fifth Congressional
District, and as an American, I recog-
nize how we are beneficiaries of Clara
Luper’s efforts to create a more just
and equitable place to live. I cannot
and will not take that history and im-
pact for granted.
Although we have come so far be-
cause of her sacrifices and the sac-
rifices of other heroes during the civil
rights era, there is so much work to be
done. Even with the number of acco-
lades given to her, the best way we can
honor Ms. Luper is to uphold her leg-
acy through commitment to justice
and equality in the policies that we
propose.
She knew that democracy is not a
spectator sport. It is our duty as a Con-
gress and as Americans to make good
on the constitutional promise of estab-
lishing justice and ensuring domestic
tranquility, so we must continue to
work for an inclusive, equitable place
for everyone to live and feel safe, as
well as to build an economy where
every American has the opportunity to
thrive.
Thank you to the sit-inners, and
thank you to Clara Luper for your re-
silience and for giving us the torch to
carry.

WELCOMING FATHER PHILIP G.
SALOIS
The SPEAKER. Without objection,
the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.
CICILLINE) is recognized for 1 minute.
There was no objection.
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to recognize Father Philip
Salois, who delivered today’s opening
prayer.
Father Phil is a native of
Woonsocket, Rhode Island, and now
lives in North Smithfield, Rhode Is-
land, a community that I am proud to
represent today in Congress.
He served our country in uniform
during the Vietnam war as a combat
infantryman and earned the Silver
Star for his valor.
After his service to our country, Fa-
ther Phil felt called to service in an-
other capacity. He was ordained into
the priesthood on June 10, 1984.
A few years later, Father Phil joined
the Veterans Administration in Bos-
ton, where he served as chief of the
chaplain service from 1993 to 2005.
Today, he continues to minister to
veterans in Rhode Island and all across
America. We owe all of our service-
members and their families an incred-
ible debt of gratitude.
The men and women of the United
States Armed Forces represent our
country’s most important values of
service, honor, courage, and sacrifice.
This is especially true of Father Phil,
who represents the very best of our
country and my home State of Rhode
Island.
I thank him for his service to our
country and for being here today to
offer the beautiful opening prayer. We
are truly honored by his presence.

GUN VIOLENCE
(Ms. BROWNLEY of California asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute.)
Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr.
Speaker, 2 weeks ago, President Trump
falsely declared that there was a na-
tional emergency occurring at our
southern border.
The real emergency that he should be
focusing on is the devastating gun vio-
lence epidemic that has torn commu-
nities apart across our country, includ-
ing my own, where we are still mourn-
ing the loss of 12 precious lives at the
Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand
Oaks, California.
This week, the House will vote on the
first major gun safety legislation in
decades. While there is no single an-
swer that will stop all gun violence,
H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112 are commonsense,
bipartisan steps to strengthen our
background check system to keep
deadly firearms out of the hands of
those we agree should not have them.
If the President is serious about ad-
dressing national emergencies, he
should join us in supporting these bills.

Technology is celebrating 30 years of

lina.

lina introduced the legislation that led
to the creation of the program. It later
was renamed in his honor.
The MEP has served over 26,000 com-
panies. It has earned support in Con-
gress for assisting small- to mid-sized
manufacturers.
I am grateful that the South Caro-
lina MEP has generated almost $380
million in new investment and created
1,361 jobs. It generated almost $2.7 bil-
lion in statewide economic impact.
In the Second Congressional District,
it helped to create and retain 989 jobs
last year and brought in over $30 mil-
lion in new investment.
I commend these employers for cre-
ating jobs in South Carolina and na-
tionwide.
In conclusion, God bless our troops,
and we will never forget September the
11th in the global war on terrorism.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2241
February 27, 2019
GUN VIOLENCE
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, for decades,
lobbyists have stifled our national con-
versation about gun violence and Con-
gress has refused to act.
Since Parkland, Thousand Oaks, and
so many others, new voices have bro-
ken through. Student activists have
marched, organized—alongside moms—
and insisted that we take their safety
seriously.
This week we do just that, by passing
H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112. This will be a sea
change.
And it shouldn’t be controversial.
Mr. Speaker, 97 percent of Americans
support background checks—that is
Democrats and Republicans—including
94 percent of gun-owning households.
Six years ago, I was there when the
Pennsylvania House Judiciary Com-
mittee held its first hearing on back-
ground checks.
In her courageous testimony, Sandy
Hook mother Francine Wheeler de-
scribed losing her son Ben. She said:
When this happens to you—when my child
was murdered, I no longer have the fear to
stand up and to say what is right and what
I believe.
And then Francine asked a crucial
question:
If we all agree dangerous individuals
shouldn’t have guns, then shouldn’t we at
least take the most basic steps to make sure
they don’t?
I look forward to the passage of these
bills.
f
RECOGNIZING DELEGATES OF THE
NATIONAL CENTER FOR LEARN-
ING DISABILITIES
(Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to recognize a very impres-
sive group of individuals visiting the
Capitol this week.
Delegates of the National Center for
Learning Disabilities have traveled
from all over the country to advocate
for themselves and their peers.
When it comes to learning, each of us
must deal with our own unique chal-
lenges. These young people face some
particularly difficult obstacles, includ-
ing dyslexia and dysgraphia, which
interfere with the brain’s ability to in-
terpret information.
But they have not let these obstacles
prevent them from doing great things.
They have persevered, working hard,
not just for their own success but for
the future success of others.
By traveling to Washington to share
their stories and discuss opportunities
for governmental and societal change,
these young adults have demonstrated
deep commitment to the community of
those who have learning disabilities.
I admire their dedication and hope to
use my role as co-chair of the Congres-
sional Dyslexia Caucus to help them in
these efforts. May they be encouraged
to keep up their great work.
f
GUN VIOLENCE
(Ms. WEXTON asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, several
years ago, I had a conversation with
one of my constituents that I think
about often.
She told me about when she sent her
5-year-old son off to his first week of
kindergarten in the Loudoun County
Public Schools. He came home from
school one day, and he told her:
Mommy, we had an emergency drill
today. My place to hide is behind the
backpacks.
Like a backpack is going to stop a
round from an AR–15.
And she decided right then and there
that we need to do better for our kids
and that she needed to do something.
Her way of doing something was to
start the Loudoun chapter of Moms De-
mand Action.
Now she and millions more like her
have sent us here to do something
about gun violence.
We may not be able to stop every
school shooting, every act of gun vio-
lence, but shouldn’t we at least try to
stop some? Because if we won’t do that
we shouldn’t be here.
Today, for the first time in decades,
the United States Congress will vote on
meaningful gun violence prevention
legislation. We will vote on and pass
H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background
Checks Act of 2019, and I will proudly
vote ‘‘yes’’ because these checks will
save lives.
f
HONORING OLYMPIC CHAMPION
BARNEY EWELL
(Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today during Black History Month to
honor an Olympic champion and truly
one of the greatest athletes my district
has ever produced: Mr. Henry Norwood,
otherwise known as ‘‘Barney,’’ Ewell.
Mr. Ewell was born into poverty and
grew up in Lancaster. He attended
McCaskey High School and later went
on to attend Penn State. He served his
country for 4 years, from 1941 to 1945,
during World War II.
He became known as the fastest man
in the world after he broke the world
record for the 50-yard dash in 1940. He
went on to win one gold and two silver
medals at the 1948 Olympics in London.
I know people who still recall cheer-
ing on the streets in Lancaster City
after Barney Ewell returned from Lon-
don, having won the medals for our
country and for our community.
Mr. Ewell was an inspiration to Lan-
caster City, and it is an honor to high-
light his story today.
GUN VIOLENCE
(Ms. SHALALA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, in June
2016, a gunman opened fire in the Pulse
nightclub in Orlando, Florida, killing
49 people, including Jerry Wright, a
Miami Heat fan who loved to dance.
Jerry Wright’s parents, Fred and
Maria, know that their son’s death was
preventable but, more than that, that
it was not unusual.
Nearly 40,000 people die because of
guns every year, and that is why Fred
and Maria lead the local Moms Demand
Action group in my district. I am so
proud to learn from them and work
with them on commonsense gun safety
in Miami-Dade and around the country.
By mandating universal background
checks for every gun sale, we can be a
step closer to ensuring that, when our
children go to school, to concerts, to
movie theaters, to clubs, they do so
safely, they do so without worrying
that this dance might be their last.
Fred and Maria Wright aren’t asking
for an overhaul of the Second Amend-
ment; they are just asking for the
adoption of commonsense solutions.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join us in preventing firearms from
falling into the wrong hands by sup-
porting H.R. 8.
f
EMERGENCY DECLARATION
(Mr. DESJARLAIS asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. DESJARLAIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to support President Trump’s
declaration of a national emergency at
the U.S.-Mexico border.
Sophisticated cartels—some of the
most dangerous criminals and terrorist
organizations in the world—are
partnering with foreign adversaries, in-
cluding Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, and
China smuggling drugs, as well as
human beings, into our country.
Mexican cartels produce or distribute
the most heroin, fentanyl, cocaine, and
methamphetamine here, killing tens of
thousands of Americans annually.
My constituents are suffering from
the opioid epidemic.
MS–13 and other violent gangs have
infiltrated recent migrant caravans;
however, the equivalent of a migrant
caravan crosses the border almost
weekly.
These forces are destabilizing and
deadly to people on both sides, particu-
larly for the less fortunate among us.
Under legal authority Congress has
granted the executive branch—which
Barack Obama also used to combat car-
tels and illegal immigration—the
President, the power to declare a na-
tional emergency to fund construction
of the new border barriers at dangerous
weak points.

tionalist, and strong advocate for the

BACKGROUND CHECKS WORK
(Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speak-
er, today is a momentous day, one that
makes me proud of this Chamber. After
years of inaction, Congress is moving
to address our country’s gun violence
problem.
We have seen some of the worst mass
shootings in our Nation’s history in
just the past few years. Las Vegas,
Thousand Oaks, Sutherland Springs,
Parkland, Sandy Hook—these are only
a few of the names that recently
shocked us to the core. And, sadly,
each time, Congress failed to act.
But today—today—we are offering
more than thoughts and prayers. We
are offering legislation. This bill has
bipartisan support—finally, something
we can all agree on.
Strengthening our background check
system is a small but a very important
first step. We simply cannot allow
criminals to take advantage of loop-
holes.
Background checks work. They keep
guns out of the hands of criminals, and
background checks will save lives.
No more excuses. It is just common
sense.
f
CLOSING BACKGROUND CHECK
LOOPHOLE IS LIFE SUPPORT
(Mr. DOGGETT asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, selling
a gun to a convicted felon, to a perpe-
trator of domestic violence, to a fugi-
tive from justice, merits a jail term,
but those who oppose this reasonable
background check bill are enabling
just that.
Someone who couldn’t buy a .22 in-
side a gun shop can, today, go outside
that shop and buy a military-style kill-
ing machine and get away with it.
Doctors Seth Goldstein and Lisa Ep-
stein, who visited my office this very
week on behalf of Moms Demand Ac-
tion, and 117 San Antonio physicians,
they have a view that is different from
Members of Congress concerning the
result of gun violence. They witness
this violence in the emergency room
after young bodies are torn apart.
What a different view this debate
would have if it were occurring amidst
the pain, violence, and blood in a hos-
pital emergency room, because closing
this loophole is about life support.
We have got to end the trauma. Let’s
join the doctors who are out there
seeking to save lives and do our part to
save lives by passing this bill.
BACKGROUND CHECK BILL
(Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Penn-
sylvania asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute.)
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Speaker, more than 500
Pennsylvanians are murdered with
guns each year, causing untold suf-
fering and tearing our communities
apart. Pennsylvanians are crying out
for commonsense legislation to stop
the bloodshed, legislation like H.R. 8,
the bill before us today.
Now, nobody thinks that universal
background checks would eliminate
gun violence, but the facts suggest that
they would reduce it.
In 2017, the Pennsylvania State Po-
lice ran over a million background
checks on would-be gun purchasers.
The vast majority of purchases were
approved within a few minutes. But
13,000 were stopped, and the back-
ground checks led to the arrest of 150
wanted fugitives and the arrest and
conviction of 500 other individuals for
illegally attempting to obtain a fire-
arm. Those background checks put
some bad guys in jail, and they prob-
ably saved some lives as well.
Let’s help our police enforce the laws
that keep guns out of dangerous hands.
Vote for the Bipartisan Background
Checks Act of 2019.
f
BALANCING GUN RIGHTS WITH
SAFE COMMUNITIES
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to take a stand in support of
H.R. 8, which takes a critical first step
to ensure that every person who pur-
chases a gun undergoes a background
check.
People should have the right to feel
safe from gun violence in their commu-
nity, including at home, at work, and
at school. Unfortunately, that is not
the case today in our country. Time
and time again, our communities have
experienced gun violence due to the ab-
sence of commonsense gun safety
measures.
Only 12 days ago, five people, four of
whom were my constituents, left their
homes for work at the Henry Pratt
Company in Aurora, Illinois, and never
returned. Their lives were taken by an
unspeakably horrific act of gun vio-
lence.
It is time to take immediate action
to help safeguard our communities
from gun violence, and today, for the
first time in more than two decades,
the House of Representatives will vote
on a major gun safety bill, and I will
support it.
H.R. 8 is a strong step toward making
our communities safer, and I look for-
ward to continuing to work on com-
monsense legislation that balances gun
rights with the safety of our commu-
nities.
GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION
(Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I
am so proud to stand here today as we
work to pass gun violence prevention
legislation.
I would like to share a letter from a
fifth grader constituent of mine, Alex,
from Northfield, Illinois, that perfectly
explains why we must pass H.R. 8 and
H.R. 1112.
Alex writes: ‘‘I don’t want to see in-
nocent people dying for no reason. I
want all children to feel safe at school.
I want all adults to feel safe at work. I
want all people to feel safe in their
city. I think stronger gun laws will
help and also make sure that everyone
that buys a gun has to have a thorough
background check.’’
Well, Alex, you are absolutely right,
and we are about to finally ensure that
everyone who purchases a gun under-
goes a comprehensive background
check. The next step is banning assault
weapons.
This fifth grader and students around
the country are telling us to do some-
thing real to make them safer, and fi-
nally, at long last, the House of Rep-
resentatives will take action today.
f
BEER CAN APPRECIATION/
ALUMINUM BILL
(Mr. BUCK asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like
to recognize the critical role that brew-
ers and beer importers play in our Na-
tion’s economy.
American beverage companies and
brewers employ more than 2.2 million
people nationwide, providing more
than $103 billion in wages and benefits.
In my home State of Colorado, brew-
eries have become a significant compo-
nent of my State’s culture and econ-
omy.
But in order to compete, American
beverage companies and brewers need a
fair and transparent pricing system for
aluminum. That is why I along with
my friend, Mr. LAWSON from Florida,
are introducing legislation this week
giving the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission oversight author-
ity of the aluminum market. These un-
fair market practices have not only
cost the beverage and brewing indus-
tries hundreds of millions of dollars,
they have also had harmful effects on
consumers.
With the help of the CFTC, I hope we
can resolve these pricing irregularities
that have been plaguing the market so
our Nation’s beverage companies and
brewers can continue to produce some
of America’s most popular beverages.

Bipartisan Background Checks Act of
2019.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
CICILLINE). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentleman from New
York?
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 145 and rule
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in
the Committee of the Whole House on
the state of the Union for the consider-
ation of the bill, H.R. 8.
The Chair appoints the gentleman

b 1225
IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
consideration of the bill (H.R. 8) to re-
quire a background check for every
firearm sale, with Mr. BLUMENAUER in
the chair.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the
bill is considered read the first time.
The gentleman from New York (Mr.
NADLER) and the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. COLLINS) each will control 30
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New York.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that
today we are considering H.R. 8, the Bi-
partisan Background Checks Act of
2019. We have promised the American
people that Congress would take steps
to reduce gun violence, and this bill is
a critical first step toward doing so.
During the past 4 weeks, as the Judi-
ciary Committee, and now the full
House, have discussed the issue of gun
violence, I have cited grim statistics.
Nearly 40,000 Americans lost their lives
because of guns in 2017. In fact, every
day in America, on average, 34 people
are murdered with a firearm, and more
than 183 people are injured in an at-
tack.
Gun violence of this magnitude is a
distinctly American problem. A coun-
try-to-country comparison is shocking.
For example, in 2011, the United King-
dom had 146 deaths due to gun vio-
lence; Denmark, 71; Portugal, 142; and
Japan, just 30. The United States, that
year, about 35,000.
A recent study in the American Jour-
nal of Medicine found that, compared
to 22 other high-income countries, the
gun-related murder rate in the United
States is 25 times higher. Even when
you adjust for population differences,
Americans are disproportionately
killed by gun violence.
Almost 25 years to the day after the
Brady Act was first implemented, ex-
panding our current background check
requirement to cover virtually all gun
transfers is one of the steps we must
take to address this crisis.
Under current law, only licensed fire-
arms dealers are required to conduct a
background check before transferring a
gun to another person. This means that
gun shows, online sales, and other pri-
vate sales can completely evade this
vital tool for ensuring that guns do not
get into the wrong hands. It is time to
close this dangerous loophole.
This bill would make it illegal for
any person who is not a licensed fire-
arm importer, manufacturer, or dealer
to transfer a firearm to any other per-
son who is not so licensed without a
background check. Individuals seeking
to transfer a firearm under this meas-
ure would be required to visit a li-
censed firearms dealer to run the nec-
essary background check before the
transfer could be finalized.
The bill also provides a number of ex-
ceptions to this requirement, including
gifts to family members and transfers
for hunting, target shooting, and in-
stances of imminent death or great
bodily harm.
The FBI’s internal assessment dem-
onstrated that checks processed
through the National Instant Criminal
Background Check System, often
called NICS, are approximately 99.3
percent to 99.8 percent accurate, and in
90 percent of cases, the background
checks are completed within 90 sec-
onds. H.R. 8 will provide an accurate
and speedy mechanism to help ensure
firearms do not end up in the wrong
hands.
There is no reason to continue to
make it easy for people who are legally
prohibited from possessing firearms to
acquire them by circumventing the
background check process. H.R. 8
would close this dangerous loophole
and save many, many lives. That is
why I urge my colleagues to vote in
favor of this vital legislation today.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Today I rise in strong opposition to
H.R. 8, the so-called Bipartisan Back-
ground Checks Act of 2019. This is bad
legislation that fails to make anyone
safer in any regard.
I have been listening here, sitting on
the floor for just the last few minutes
and listening to those who came up and
were happy about this bill coming for-
ward today, and they mentioned many
acts of mass violence and situations
that have happened. The sad part about
it is they claim this is the answer and
the first step. In actuality, it is, at
best, a side step, and it may actually
be a step backwards and will not do
what it is being claimed to do.
All this legislation will do is burden
law-abiding citizens wishing to exer-
cise their Second Amendment rights,
including defending themselves from
the gun-toting criminals this bill does
nothing to combat.
b 1230
H.R. 8 foolishly presumes criminals
who flout existing laws will suddenly
submit themselves to background
checks.
Are Members who support this bill
delusional enough to think a criminal
trading cocaine to another criminal for
a firearm will give consideration to
H.R. 8 and go to the nearest gun store
to submit to a background check? That
is absurd.
Most of us will agree that criminals
are not going to do that anyway. My
concern is what it actually does in
practice to those who are not crimi-
nals.
Not only is it foolish to think they
will start following the law, it is also
foolish to think it is going to in any
way make our country safer.
My Democratic friends have ex-
ploited every mass shooting, calling for
universal background checks, but H.R.
8 would not have stopped a single mass
shooting.
These strategies do, however, share
one thing in common. Over and over,
we see issues of mental health and
missed opportunities for authorities to
intercede.
Let me just say, Mr. Chair, I share
the concern. I am going to share, in
just a moment, actual, real things that
actually could make a difference in
helping to stem the tide of mass vio-
lence in our country. But doing this,
we have to understand that this bill
does not do that, and what may make
you feel good may not heal you. That
has to be understood.
Look at the recent workplace shoot-
ing in Illinois, where the gunman mur-
dered five people. That could have been
prevented, but not by H.R. 8. All law
enforcement had to do was enforce ex-
isting law. The gunman was prohibited
from possessing firearms.
In January 2014, he was issued an Illi-
nois firearm owner’s identification
card. That March, he applied to buy a
handgun from a gun dealer. Five days
later, he took possession of the gun,
having inexplicably passed a back-
ground check. That month, he applied
for a concealed carry permit. During a
background check for the permit, his
felony conviction was flagged.
Illinois police revoked his firearm
card and sent him a letter telling him
to relinquish the firearm. Not surpris-
ingly, the felon did not comply. Had
authorities seized the firearm between
March 2014 and February 2019, they
could have saved five lives.
Aurora, Illinois, is not the only
missed opportunity to prevent tragedy.
We know about missed opportunities in
Parkland; Aurora, Colorado; Suther-
land Springs; Virginia Tech; and oth-
ers.
The common problem here, Mr.
Chair, is clear. It is not a lack of back-
ground checks.
With H.R. 8, Democrats refuse to ac-
knowledge the human factors leading
to these events, but Republicans have a
bill to help law enforcement coordinate
responses to mental health concerns
and other mass violent threat informa-
tion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2244 February 27, 2019
You know what else H.R. 8 doesn’t
address? The primary ways criminals
acquire firearms. Last month, DOJ re-
vealed nearly half of criminals ob-
tained firearms via theft or the black
market. The survey also revealed that
a mere 0.8 percent of criminals pur-
chased their firearms at gun shows.
If this bill won’t prevent mass shoot-
ings and address violent crime, what
will it do? It will keep law-abiding citi-
zens from protecting themselves. Under
this bill, Mr. Chair, a battered woman
with a protection order against her
abuser who borrows a firearm for self-
defense would be a criminal. It would
criminalize the selling of a firearm
without a background check to some-
one with a valid permit allowing them
to possess, acquire, or carry a firearm.
If that person walked into a gun store,
they could present that permit and not
undergo a NICS check.
On the other hand, there are solu-
tions to prevent mass violence and gun
crime. The Mass Violence Prevention
Act, which I introduced earlier this
week, is one. The MVP Act directly ad-
dresses challenges in law enforcement
coordination and response. It would re-
duce the flow of firearms into the
black market, and it would bolster law
enforcement’s ability to prosecute
criminals for firearm offenses.
If reducing gun violence, Mr. Chair,
is the Democrats’ concern, the MVP
Act is legislation that we should be
considering today, not H.R. 8. Talk to
me or my staff about cosponsoring this
evidence-based, commonsense legisla-
tion. Unlike H.R. 8, the MVP Act could
have prevented tragedies such as Park-
land.
Unfortunately, Mr. Chair, my Demo-
cratic colleagues, by putting this for-
ward and continuing the same nar-
rative, are not actually interested in
stopping gun violence. I take the in-
tent to be good; I do not question the
motive. All of us in our life do not
want to see the tragedies unfold. But
this is not the way forward.
This is another thing put out to the
very ones who have suffered, telling
them we are helping them, while at the
same time not telling them the truth
about the bill, a bill that guts its own
ability to enforce itself, a bill that ac-
tually, possibly, would keep people
from purchasing firearms because of an
unlimited price of a background check.
The question that I have about this
bill, Mr. Chair, is not what actually
could happen with this. It is what actu-
ally will be hurt by this as we move
forward.
With that, I believe that we are being
misled. The victims of mass violence
are being misled by this bill, H.R. 8, be-
cause it would not stop what they have
been promised that it would stop.
Mr. Chair, for that, I am profoundly
sorry. But because of that, I call on my
colleagues to reject H.R. 8 and to sup-
port real solutions.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. BASS), the chairperson
of the Crime, Terrorism and Homeland
Security Subcommittee.
Ms. BASS. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong
support of H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Back-
ground Checks Act of 2019, which will
extend the current Federal background
check requirement to unlicensed sell-
ers of guns.
It is about time that Congress takes
this issue seriously, and I am pleased
that this bipartisan bill has been
brought to the House floor with the ur-
gency this issue deserves.
In recent years, our Nation has expe-
rienced an increase in mass shootings,
and our Nation is appropriately horri-
fied. However, mass shootings are just
one symptom of our gun violence epi-
demic. The daily toll of shootings oc-
curs in communities across our coun-
try, on our streets, in our schools, and
even in our houses of worship.
As Aalayah Eastmond testified be-
fore the Judiciary Committee earlier
this month, 1 year after the terrible
shooting that took the lives of 17 stu-
dents and staff and injured 17 others at
her high school in Parkland, Florida:
‘‘Minority communities bear the heavi-
est burden of gun violence in this coun-
try.’’
The impact on our young people is
simply unacceptable. Every day, 47
children and teens are shot in this
country. Eight of these young people
die, and 39 are shot and survive.
Citizens across this country such as
Diane Latiker, who also testified be-
fore the committee, are taking it upon
themselves to organize and engage in
community-based efforts to reduce gun
violence and to assist the young people
it affects. We in Congress must match
their courage and commitment with
action of our own.
I support H.R. 8 because it will re-
duce gun violence by narrowing the
avenues for criminals and other prohib-
ited persons from obtaining guns.
Certainly, there is no single change
to our gun laws that will prevent every
shooting, but enacting measures that
will help prevent some of them is clear-
ly the right thing to do.
Mr. Chair, that is why I support this
bill, and I ask my colleagues to do the
same.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair,
unfortunately, this bill does not nar-
row—in fact, it continues the process
of those who are going to receive guns.
Much of the daily toll that we see is ac-
tually coming from those who are al-
ready violating laws currently on the
books. It is time we actually enforce
those as well.
Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from California (Mr.
MCCLINTOCK).
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chair, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Chairman, H.R. 8 is brought to us
by the same groups and politicians who
have made no secret of their desire to
ultimately strip law-abiding citizens of
their right to defend themselves. Now,
they can’t do that outright; they know
that. So they do it through cynical
measures like this, which weave a web
of laws so intricate, that, sooner or
later, everyone can be caught up in
them.
This law affects not just transfer of
ownership, but any transfer of weapon
for any period of time. Suppose you ex-
change shotguns with a friend on a
hunt and then separate for a period of
time, or you loan a gun to your next-
door neighbor of 20 years who is being
victimized by a stalker, or you give a
gun to your stepson or your great-
grandson. Under any of these innocent
scenarios and countless more like
them, you are guilty of a Federal
crime.
These flaws were all pointed out to
the bill’s sponsors, and none were ad-
dressed. Why not? I think the reason
should be obvious.
Last October, a 10-year study by
Johns Hopkins and UC Davis concluded
that California’s universal background
check law had no effect on gun homi-
cides or suicides—none.
The purpose of this bill is not public
safety. That is just a deceptive facade.
Its true purpose is to make gun owner-
ship so legally hazardous, so fraught
with legal booby traps and draconian
penalties, that no honest and law-abid-
ing citizen would want to take the risk
of gun ownership.
Most criminals already get their
guns illegally and are unconstrained by
laws like this. Make no mistake, this is
aimed squarely at law-abiding citizens,
moving us closer to a society where de-
cent people are defenseless and armed
criminals are kings.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Rhode
Island (Mr. CICILLINE), a member of the
committee.
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Chair, we have a
gun violence epidemic in this country.
For 8 years, we have marked it with
moments of silence and doing nothing,
saying nothing and doing nothing. But
today, that changes with passage of
H.R. 8 for universal background
checks.
We know universal background
checks work, because since the passage
of the Brady bill, 3.5 million illegal gun
sales were prevented. But, of course,
there is a huge loophole. Millions and
millions of gun sales happen without a
background check at all. In fact, one in
five, 22 percent, of guns are sold with
no background check. That means
criminals, domestic abusers, and peo-
ple prohibited due to mental illness
can get a gun. This bill changes that.
We also know that States that have
enhanced background checks have
lower rates of gun homicides, gun sui-
cide rates, and gun trafficking.
This is a commonsense bill to protect
the American people from the scourge
of gun violence.
Finally, after 8 years of pleading
with our Republican colleagues to do
something about gun violence in this
country, to take up a bill—we had a
sit-in to try to force a vote—finally,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2245
February 27, 2019
today, we are taking our first step to
reduce gun violence in this country by
passing H.R. 8.
Finally, we will see Members of Con-
gress standing up to the power of the
gun lobby and doing what is right for
the American people.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
vote ‘‘yes.’’
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I
remind the Chair that we did pass Fix
NICS last year. We did take into ac-
count—those things have been done.
We just simply are not moving a bill
that we don’t feel works, and we actu-
ally have offered an alternative.
Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS).
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentleman for yielding.
Mr. Chairman, I tell you that H.R. 8
will do little more than further burden
law-abiding gun owners. Without an
unconstitutional Federal gun registry,
this bill is impossible to enforce.
There is no gun show loophole. Fed-
eral law is the same regardless of
where a firearm sale takes place. Fed-
eral law requires all firearms dealers to
be licensed and to initiate a back-
ground check before transferring a fire-
arm to a nondealer, regardless of where
that transfer takes place.
As for nondealers, Federal law pro-
hibits transferring a firearm to anyone
known or believed to be prohibited
from possessing firearms. That is al-
ready the law.
According to DOJ, less than 1 percent
of criminals in State prison for firearm
crimes get their firearms from dealers
or nondealers at gun shows. According
to ATF, 6 percent of Federal armed ca-
reer criminals got their firearms from
dealers or nondealers at gun shows.
Online sales loophole: There is no on-
line sales loophole. The Federal law is
the same regardless of how people com-
municate about selling or buying a
firearm.
Federal law prohibits anyone, li-
censed firearm dealer or not, from
shipping a firearm to a person who
lives in another State unless the re-
ceiver is also a dealer. Dealers must
document all firearms they receive.
H.R. 8 also fails to include many of
the realistic exceptions to the new
background check requirements for
private transfers, such as transfers be-
tween law enforcement officers outside
of their duties, transfers to concealed
carry permit holders, transfers to mu-
seums or licensed collectors, transfers
to Active Duty military, and many
more.
H.R. 8 includes an exception to the
background check transfer if the trans-
fer is necessary to prevent imminent
death or great bodily harm. But that
transfer is only allowed for the length
of time that it is necessary to prevent
imminent death or great bodily harm.
It doesn’t even define those terms.
What about a false alarm? Does it ex-
tend to domestic violence fears if the
person is not getting attacked imme-
diately? Gun rights groups have argued
that without a definition, this provi-
sion would only provide protection in
instances where it is likely too late for
the victim to make it out safely.
Finally, H.R. 8 would not have pre-
vented any of the recent high-profile
shootings. In those cases, the shooter
either passed a Federal background
check or stole the firearms they used.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. THOMPSON), the chief au-
thor of this legislation and the chair-
man of the Gun Violence Prevention
Task Force.
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr.
Chair, I thank the gentleman for yield-
ing.
Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of
my bill, H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Back-
ground Checks Act of 2019.
Mr. Chair, first, I thank Speaker
PELOSI and Chairman NADLER for their
support. Gun violence is a true na-
tional emergency, and I am glad that
we are moving so early in this Congress
to address this crisis.
Mr. Chair, I also thank my colleagues
on the other side of the aisle who rec-
ognize the importance of passing this
legislation, Representatives KING,
FITZPATRICK, MAST, UPTON, and SMITH,
who stand with more than 90 percent of
Americans who support universal back-
ground checks.
b 1245
This bill will require a background
check on all firearm sales and most
transfers. Mr. Chairman, I am a life-
long gun owner. I am a hunter and I
support the Second Amendment. If this
bill did anything to erode the rights of
lawful gun owners, I wouldn’t support
it and it wouldn’t have my name on it.
Background checks work. Every day,
they stop 170 felons and 50 domestic
abusers from getting a gun from a li-
censed dealer. But, in some States,
those same people can go into a gun
show or go online and buy a gun with-
out a background check. This bill will
help stop them from doing so.
Some will argue that criminals won’t
follow the law. If that is the case, then
why do we have laws against murder?
People still commit murder. Why do we
have laws against stealing? People still
steal. This is flawed logic, and don’t
fall for it.
This bill is supported by law enforce-
ment, medical professionals, veterans,
gun owners, religious leaders, and the
millions of Americans who took to the
streets in support of H.R. 8.
Mr. Chairman, I ask that my col-
leagues support this bill and honor the
lives lost with action. No more mo-
ments of silence with no action to fol-
low. Today, your thoughts and your
prayers aren’t enough. Today, you can
vote, ‘‘yes’’.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK).
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentleman from Georgia for yield-
ing to me.
Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose H.R. 8,
a bill that criminalizes gun transfers
between law-abiding citizens who have
no criminal record and no criminal in-
tent.
The bill includes several flawed and
unworkable exceptions. Take the law
enforcement exception. It allows the
police to transfer a firearm, but crim-
inalizes transfers to law enforcement.
Under this bill, a parent whose child
finds a gun in a park commits a Fed-
eral crime if the parent surrenders the
gun to police.
Under this bill, a citizen commits a
Federal crime if they participate in a
local gun buy-back program.
Under this bill, an attorney commits
a Federal crime when they turn a cli-
ent’s gun over to the police to clear the
client through ballistics testing.
Will criminalizing cooperation with
law enforcement make us safer? The
majority apparently thinks so, and I
think it is crazy.
The Democrats’ bill gives special
privileges to the bodyguards of the
wealthy elite, like former Mayor
Bloomberg, who is funding the special
interest advocacy for this bill. He can
afford to hire bodyguards. But average
Americans, who rely on the Second
Amendment as their source of personal
protection, are not given similar pro-
tections.
Nothing should be more offensive to
this body than a bill that denies citi-
zens their endowed rights while giving
wealthy elites special protections,
privileges, and dispensations. But that
is H.R. 8.
Take the family exception; the rule
allows a vote on an amendment to en-
sure that transfers between parent and
child include stepparents and step-
children. What about transfers between
a foster parent and foster child? This
bill says foster relationships are not
worthy of the same respect and equal
treatment. Every Member of this body
should be ashamed to vote for this bill
that reflects such terrible policy and
discrimination.
Take the Good Samaritan exception,
allowing transfers where a threat of
death or harm is imminent. Imminent
means death is menacingly near, a
standard so strict that it is, frankly,
too late to transfer a gun once it is ob-
vious a gun is needed for protection.
Under this standard, it is illegal to
loan a gun to a victim of domestic vio-
lence for her protection until the
transferor is practically witnessing a
murder in progress.
This standard would also prevent a
gun owner who has intermittent suici-
dal thoughts, a known side-effect of
certain prescription medications, from
legally transferring a gun—his own
gun—to a friend for safekeeping.
Because this bill criminalizes trans-
fers between law-abiding Americans,
while doing nothing to curb criminals’
access to guns, this bill provides the
American public with a false sense of
security.
Because this bill includes unworkable
exceptions that will mislead people

into thinking a gun transfer is legal
when it is not, this bill provides law-
abiding gun owners with a false sense
of immunity.
Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on
this totally and completely unconstitu-
tional legislation that would deprive
people of their constitutional rights to
keep and bear arms.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield
21⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from
Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH), a member of
the committee.
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Chairman, I
thank Chairman NADLER for yielding.
Mr. Chairman, today marks a very
pivotal moment in our fight to prevent
gun violence and to ensure the safety
of every community across our Nation.
I thank the more than 230 of my col-
leagues who have cosponsored H.R. 8,
the Bipartisan Background Checks Act
of 2019. I thank Chairman NADLER,
Speaker PELOSI, Congressman THOMP-
SON, and Congressman KING for making
gun violence prevention a priority in
this Congress. I am so proud to be an
original cosponsor of this historic leg-
islation.
As many of you may know, gun vio-
lence is an issue that is deeply personal
for me. Gun violence prevention and a
desire to make meaningful change is
the very reason I am here today, in
this legislative body, speaking to every
one of you.
In 2012, my son, Jordan Davis, was
shot and killed by a man who opened
fire on a car of unarmed teenagers at a
gas station in Jacksonville, Florida.
My son was only 17 years of age. Jor-
dan would have turned 24 this month.
After my son’s death, I dedicated my
entire life to advocating for common-
sense gun safety solutions, but it was
the shooting at Marjory Stoneman
Douglas High School in Parkland, Flor-
ida, last year, that finally motivated
me to join this legislative body.
The overwhelming bipartisan support
for universal background checks sym-
bolizes the power of advocacy and the
incredible power of the survivors, fam-
ily members, and students who have
shared their stories as they advocate
for commonsense gun safety solutions
and demand that we act to address gun
violence.
Today, we are truly taking this ac-
tion. H.R. 8 will ensure that mothers
and fathers have one less reason to
worry. It will give students one less
thing to fear when they walk into a
school. Most importantly, it will make
our communities and our Nation a
safer place to live, and every human
being in America deserves such.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 8, the Bipartisan
Background Checks Act of 2019. It is
time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. STEUBE).
Mr. STEUBE. Mr. Chairman, today, I
rise in opposition to H.R. 8.
Mr. Chairman, this legislation claims
to be a solution to gun violence, yet
does nothing to actually solve the real
problems that contribute to this crisis.
As it stands now, this legislation does
nothing to make our schools, churches,
or communities safer. In fact, it only
infringes on the constitutionally guar-
anteed Second Amendment rights of
law-abiding American citizens, some-
thing I cannot support.
This bill will criminalize the private
transfer of firearms and will make ex-
ercising basic constitutional rights im-
possibly expensive for millions of law-
abiding Americans. Not to mention, it
is essentially unenforceable without a
national gun registry. But, let’s be
honest, that is where my colleagues on
the other side of the aisle want to end
up: registering firearms so they can
systematically take them away. We
must stop our Nation from falling
down this slippery slope.
I think we can all agree that some-
thing needs to be done to stop the ille-
gal ownership and misuse of firearms,
but H.R. 8 is not the answer. This legis-
lation would have done nothing to pre-
vent many of the prominent tragedies
that occurred in my home State of
Florida.
The shooter at Marjorie Stoneman
Douglas High School in Parkland
passed a background check. The shoot-
er at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando
passed a background check. And, just
weeks ago, a man who murdered five
women in my district passed a back-
ground check.
H.R. 8 would have done nothing to
stop these violent acts, just like the
previous attempts to require universal
background checks have done nothing
to prevent actual crimes.
If Democrats are serious about gun
violence, they would have voted for my
amendment. I filed an amendment in
committee that would have required
law enforcement to be notified upon
the attempt of someone to purchase a
firearm and failed a background check.
Law enforcement would have been no-
tified. But instead of supporting poli-
cies that curtail legal possession of
firearms, the Democrats on both the
Judiciary Committee and the Rules
Committee rejected my proposal. How
is that unreasonable?
Mr. Chairman, I stand for the Con-
stitution. I stand for freedom. And I
stand for the Second Amendment. That
is why I am not voting for this pro-
posal.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I will
point out that the bill says:
Nothing in this act . . . shall be construed
to authorize the establishment, directly or
indirectly, of a national firearms registry.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from California (Ms.
PELOSI), the distinguished Speaker of
the House.
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentleman for yielding and I thank
him for his leadership as chair of the
Judiciary Committee, for bringing us
to this place promptly. It is an historic
day in the Congress of the United
States.
Mr. Chairman, I thank our distin-
guished colleague from California, Mr.
MIKE THOMPSON, for his relentless, per-
sistent leadership to make America
safer by bringing forth commonsense
background check legislation. He is a
gun owner and a veteran. He has been
on both sides of the gun. He is a hun-
ter. He is an advocate for the Second
Amendment. And, as he said, if this
had anything to diminish that, he
would not have his name on it.
Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of
this strong, bipartisan bill and join Mr.
THOMPSON in commending Mr. KING of
New York for making this initiative bi-
partisan from the start, in the previous
Congress and now. It is a long, overdue
commonsense action to end the epi-
demic of gun violence in America.
Let us salute, again, the persistent
leadership of so many in this body.
And, again, Mr. THOMPSON, as chair of
the Gun Violence Prevention Task
Force; he has worked in a bipartisan
way to protect our communities, and
we are grateful to him for that.
We can do all the inside maneuvering
that we want, and that is really impor-
tant and essential, but, without the
outside mobilization, we cannot enjoy
the success of saving lives and making
progress. So I want to thank the coura-
geous advocates who are here today, in
the gallery, including March for Our
Lives and Moms Demand Action for
Gun Sense in America, and so many
more. They have made a complete dif-
ference.
As President Lincoln said: ‘‘Public
sentiment is everything. With it you
can accomplish almost anything, with-
out it almost nothing.’’
I thank them for building public sen-
timent to a point where now about 90
percent of the American people support
commonsense background check legis-
lation, including many members, cou-
rageously, of the National Rifle Asso-
ciation.
This bill is proudly bipartisan be-
cause gun violence prevention should
not be a Democratic or Republican
issue. Gun violence does not discrimi-
nate by party or politics. It reaches
into all of our communities, our
schools, our places of worship, our
workplaces, and our streets, and it will
require all of our courage to defeat it.
Last night, we were at an occasion to
mark the 25th anniversary of the Brady
Bill. Some of us were in Congress at
that time. Many of us here, then or
not, admire the courageous work of
Sarah and Jim Brady to make the
country a safer place by reducing gun
violence.
Twenty-five years ago, we enacted
the Brady background check system,
which has denied more than 3 million
sales to potentially dangerous individ-
uals. Yet, the Brady Bill does not stop
people from purchasing guns from unli-
censed sellers without a background
check at gun shows and online.
We must pass H.R. 8 to close this
dangerous loophole and keep our com-
munities safe from gun violence. That
is what we are intending to do today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2247
February 27, 2019
George Bernard Shaw said that: ‘‘It is
the mark of a truly intelligent person
to be moved by statistics,’’ and here
are the facts:
Nearly 40,000 lives are cut short every
year from gun violence.
An average of 47 children and teen-
agers are killed by guns every single
day. As I said, it is all about the chil-
dren, the children, the children.
We read about the tragic mass mur-
ders that have happened in our coun-
try, and they stir us to action, hope-
fully. Here it has been they stir us to a
moment of silence, and now, finally, to
action.
b 1300
But it is every day. Every day 47 chil-
dren and teenagers killed by guns.
And, again, another figure, heark-
ening back to 90 percent of the Amer-
ican people want commonsense uni-
versal background checks.
The statistics spell out the stories,
but it is the human personal stories
that change minds.
How moving it was to hear our col-
league, Congresswoman MCBATH, with
her generosity of spirit tell her per-
sonal story of losing her son, Jordan—
I can’t even imagine carrying that bur-
den—but turning her grief and her
tragedy into action and courage to run
for Congress, to stand on this floor and
share her personal story with us. That
takes real courage.
Let’s hope that we all have the cour-
age to save children’s lives, everyone’s
lives in our country whose deaths can
be avoided.
There is no person in this body whose
political survival is more important
than the survival of our children.
We are grateful, again, to the young
people, parents, survivors across Amer-
ica who have told their stories,
marched for their lives, and demanded
change. This bill delivers that change,
ensuring that people who are a danger
to themselves and others cannot pur-
chase a gun and perpetuate violence in
our communities.
This week, the House will build on
this progress by passing another bipar-
tisan background check bill. We must
close the Charleston loophole that en-
abled the horrific hate crime at Eman-
uel African Methodist Episcopal
Church.
We salute the majority whip, Mr.
CLYBURN, for his leadership on H.R.
1112.
Tomorrow, we will vote on that. That
is another part of strengthening the
background check provisions.
As Members of Congress, again, we
take an oath to protect and defend the
Constitution, the American people. To
honor that oath, to honor the victims
of gun violence and their families, Con-
gress must take real action on this
floor. Today, we must pass this bill and
take the first steps toward ending the
senseless crisis of gun violence in our
Nation.
Again, I hope that all of us will have
the courage to save lives, remembering
that no one’s political survival here is
more important than the survival of
the American people—especially our
children.
I urge a strong bipartisan ‘‘yes’’ vote
and pray that we can do the right thing
and send a clear message to the fami-
lies of those who have lost their loved
ones to gun violence, that we have
crossed a threshold here today to re-
duce gun violence in our country and
take more steps to improve the safety
of the American people, honoring the
Constitution of the United States, re-
spectful of our hunters and the need for
people to defend themselves, but doing
so in a way that does not endanger oth-
ers.
The CHAIR. Members are reminded
to avoid referencing occupants of the
gallery.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I
agree. I believe facts are important,
and I believe the strength to tell that.
I believe the chairman just redid that.
He exactly explained why this bill will
not operate because of the very fact
that, inside the bill itself, it does not
have a registry, which I will remind
the Chair that the Department of Jus-
tice under President Obama said a uni-
versal background check bill will not
work without a registry and is on the
websites of many advocates for this
bill. That is just one of the areas that
we look at as we go forward in real-
izing that this has already gutted itself
when we look at the bill.
Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CLINE).
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Chair, I want to
thank the previous speaker, the Speak-
er of the House, reminding us all that
it is California where Michael
Bloomberg and the gun control advo-
cates have established their utopia of a
land without guns. And what has it led
us to? With some of the strictest gun
control laws in the land, we have some
of the worst incidents of gun violence
in the country.
Gun control measures do not address
the problems of gun violence, and this
bill will not address gun violence.
Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition
to H.R. 8. The legislation is an attempt
to take away our Second Amendment
rights, hidden under the guise that we
will see a reduction in violent crime.
My colleagues on the other side of
the aisle claim the bill would save
lives, but nothing in this bill would
have stopped any of the recent mass
casualty shootings that have occurred
in our country. The only thing this bill
does is limit the Second Amendment
rights of law-abiding citizens.
They will tell you this bill closes
loopholes; however, the loophole that
they believe exists is private gun own-
ership, and what they really want is to
regulate the private transfer of fire-
arms. If my neighbor is in trouble and
needs to borrow a firearm to protect
his family, I should be allowed to loan
that firearm to my neighbor so that he
can protect himself and his family.
This is not something we should need
to go to the Federal Government to get
permission to do. The Second Amend-
ment does not say that, after you get
permission from the government, your
right to keep and bear arms shall not
be infringed.
Our Founding Fathers wrote the Con-
stitution to protect us from the gov-
ernment and gave individuals the Sec-
ond Amendment to protect themselves.
I carry this Constitution every day
on the campaign trail asphalt. I carry
it with me every day now to remind
myself of those protections that were
given to us—not by government, but by
God.
This bill is nothing more than an at-
tempt to advance the agenda of radical
gun-grabbers and lay the foundation
for a national gun registration scheme.
Mr. Chair, I urge the House to reject
this misguided legislation so we can
begin having real discussions about
ways to reduce crime across this great
Nation.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. GARCIA), a
member of the committee.
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Chair, I
thank the chairman for yielding, and I
rise today to express my strong support
for this bill, the Bipartisan Back-
ground Checks Act.
Since the Brady law was enacted in
1994, many American lives have been
saved, murders have fallen by at least
32 percent, and our community streets
are safer and stronger as a result. But
our work is not done. In Houston alone,
we see an average of 550 acts of gun vi-
olence per year.
Too many of our loved ones are lost
to senseless gun violence that could be
prevented by keeping firearms out of
dangerous hands. We know expanded
background checks work.
States requiring background checks
on all handgun sales see half as many
mass shootings as States without the
expanded requirements. That is why I
am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 8. This
commonsense bill will prevent private
firearm sales to prohibit purchasers
and close online and gun show loop-
holes.
While this bill does not cover every-
thing, it is a step in the right direction
that will make my district—Houston,
Texas—and this country safer.

may I request the time for both sides,
please.

Georgia has 111⁄2 minutes remaining.
The gentleman from New York has 163⁄4

Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I

Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Chair, my name

forcement officer for 23 years in the
great State of Minnesota, the city of
Duluth.

firearm tried to take my life. I was
shot in the head, and by the grace of
God, I survived.
A few years after that, while on duty
in a hostage situation, another crimi-
nal pulled a gun on me. Face-to-face, I
was staring down the barrel of a hand-
gun. The suspect pulled the trigger.
The gun malfunctioned, and I was in a
fight for my life. When it was all over,
by the grace of God, I was alive. The
individual was handcuffed.
Both those individuals were career
criminals.
Back to when I was shot in the head,
Mr. Chair: I begged the U.S. attorney,
along with our police department, to
charge the individual with possession
of a handgun by a felon. They didn’t do
it. That individual was allowed to cir-
cumvent our community for another 8
years before he was finally put in pris-
on, where he belonged. No more harm-
ing other people.
Representative COLLINS’ Mass Vio-
lence Prevention Act gets the county
attorneys and our Federal attorneys
present to prosecute these individuals
who have no respect for life.
I carried a handgun for 23 years, Mr.
Chair, as a tool to defend my life or
somebody else’s life from great bodily
harm. I support the individual right of
law-abiding citizens, the right to keep
and bear arms.
Both my wife and I live in rural Min-
nesota. When we need to protect our-
selves, when it takes awhile for law en-
forcement to get there, we have the
ability.
There is nobody I know who wants
somebody who is going through a men-
tal health issue or a career criminal or
a drug dealer to have these.
We need to start respecting life. Life
is precious, from conception to natural
death. I am a very proud husband of an
Iraq war veteran who understands the
value of life.
Mr. Chair, I rise against this. There
are better ways to get mothers and fa-
thers, county attorneys, Federal pros-
ecutors, local police departments, and
sheriff departments to work together
to have a fusion center so, when a
young individual types into a computer
‘‘I want to be a mass school shooter,’’
there is an instant response to identify
the individual and work through it.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH), a
member of the committee.
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Chair, we intro-
duced H.R. 8 8 years ago after our
friend and former colleague, Gabby Gif-
fords, was shot and nearly killed.
When she was by our side to intro-
duce the bill, she said: ‘‘Speaking is
still difficult for me, but I don’t think
I can make myself more clear: Con-
gress must act to make our country
safer from gun violence.’’
Now is that time. We have waited too
long to close loopholes that let people
easily avoid background checks
through private sales. I have cried with
too many survivors and attended too
many funerals. I have marched with
too many student activists, and I have
bowed my head through too many mo-
ments of silence.
We know strong gun laws work. In
the 25 years since the Brady law took
effect, background checks have stopped
more than $3 million in gun sales and
have saved countless lives.
It is time to expand the Brady law. It
is time to close the dangerous loop-
holes. It is past time for Congress to
take action to save lives from gun vio-
lence.
Mr. Chair, this is not a moment of si-
lence. This is not a sit-in. This is ac-
tion by the United States House of
Representatives on behalf of everyone
who has pled for that action after San
Bernardino and after Sutherland
Springs and after Fort Hood and after
Virginia Tech and after Columbine and
Sandy Hook and Las Vegas and Pulse
and everyday gun violence in our com-
munities and, yes, after Parkland.
Let’s represent the 95 percent of the
American people who want us to take
this action to help save lives. Let’s
pass H.R. 8.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair,
before I yield to the gentlelady, it has
been quoted here, especially, 90 to 95
percent of the people want universal
background checks. And everything
has statistics, a poll, but when actually
put to the voters of Maine, the voters
of Maine actually rejected it, and I un-
derstand where they are coming from
on that.
Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. SMITH).
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Chair, I
rise today to defend the Second
Amendment rights of law-abiding Ne-
braskans.
In Nebraska, the need for firearms is
the same today as it was even when the
Second Amendment was enacted before
we were even a territory of the United
States.
Rural Nebraskans depend on their
firearms for self-defense and for pro-
tecting their livestock. They also know
how to handle firearms, to store them
securely, to handle them appropriately,
and perhaps to even let neighbors who
are able to use them safely borrow
them to meet their needs.
I have serious concerns. The bills we
are considering today and tomorrow
are going to criminalize this behavior
for Nebraskans who have done this for
generations and won’t even know that
they are breaking the law.
Should a rancher who lends a rifle to
a neighbor to address threats from
predatory animals face a year in prison
and a $100,000 fine? No.
Should a legally carrying farmer who
is injured at work be subject to arrest
for handing his firearm off before being
taken to the hospital? No.
These are exactly the situations this
bill would create, while doing little to
address the real problems underlying
crime in our society.
Mr. Chair, this is a bad bill, and I
urge its swift rejection.

ings, which I will include in the

According to The Washington Post, since
1966, 1077 individuals have been fatally shot
and wounded as a result of mass shootings in
which more than four people perished; Chil-
dren and teenagers compose about a tenth of
these fatalities. Almost 300 guns have been
obtained by authorities in these shootings,
and over half of them were obtained legally.
The AR–15 rifle has been increasingly used in
such shootings, with the latest being in this
month’s most recent high school shooting in
Florida. It is estimated that more than 8
million of these weapons are owned in Amer-
ican households. The trend in mass shootings
has been rising notably since 2006–07.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I
thank Moms Demand Action, and I
thank all those who have offered them-
selves in this fight. I thank our chair,
Mr. THOMPSON, for his constant and
persistent work.
Through my tenure as ranking mem-
ber of the Crime, Terrorism, Homeland
Security, and Investigations Sub-
committee, and now third in seniority
on the Judiciary Committee, it has
given me a picture that many have not
seen, and that is that we have been
fighting for gun safety legislation for
almost three decades.
It seems that even though Mr. Cohen
is in a hearing right now where facts
are being disputed, there are no facts
to dispute the fact that people die from
guns. And those who get guns are never
regulated.
By no means do I want you not to
have a handgun to protect yourself, or
to enforce gun trafficking laws, or to
make sure that prosecutors prosecute
those for gun possession, but it begs
the question. What is the question?
The interpretation of the Second
Amendment is no one should prohibit
the right to bear arms. As I stand here
today, there is nothing in the under-
lying bill that is prohibiting that.
It is simply common sense and giving
dignity to those who died at the Col-
umbine High School shooting, the At-
lanta shooting, the Wedgwood Baptist
Church shooting, the Lockheed Martin
shooting, the Living Church of God
shooting, the Red Lake High School
shooting, the Northern Illinois Univer-
sity shooting, the Santa Fe shooting in
Texas, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas
High School shooting, and the Suther-
land Springs church shooting in Texas.
It says that you have to have a
check, a background check. It closes
the gun show loophole. It gives exemp-
tions for the issues of domestic vio-
lence and sexual assault. It allows fam-
ilies to transfer, and ranchers, farmers,
and fishers to transfer.
My God, what more do we want? Peo-
ple have died. Are we not going to show
that we are committed to saving lives,
not to abuse the Second Amendment,
to misuse it? We can bear arms. But
the question is whether or not we will
recognize that there are 350-plus mil-
lion Americans, and there are more
guns in this country than there are
citizens.
I beg of my colleagues: Stop the vio-
lence. Vote for this bill.
Mr. Chair, as a senior member of the Judici-
ary Committee and an original co-sponsor, I
rise in strong of H.R. 8, the ‘‘Bipartisan Back-
ground Checks Act of 2019,’’ legislation that
strengthens the background check system that
is already in place to purchase a firearm.
A 2013 study found that approximately 80
percent of all firearms acquired for criminal
purposes were obtained from sources who
were not required to run a background check
and that 96 percent of inmates who were not
prohibited from possessing a firearm at the
time they committed their crime obtained their
gun this way.
This loophole exists largely because unli-
censed sellers need not conduct any back-
ground check under current law, even if the
sellers sell a large number of guns.
H.R. 8, the ‘‘Bipartisan Background Checks
Act of 2019,’’ would make it illegal for any per-
son who is not a licensed firearm importer,
manufacturer, or dealer to transfer a firearm to
any other person who is not so licensed with-
out a background check.
Individuals seeking to transfer a firearm
under this measure would be required to visit
a licensed firearms dealer to run the nec-
essary background check before the transfer
could be finalized.
H.R. 8 is intended to provide an accurate
and speedy means of ensuring firearms do not
end up in the wrong hands.
An internal assessment by the Federal Bu-
reau of investigation (FBI) demonstrated that
the National Instant Criminal Background
Checks System (‘‘NICS’’) yields results that
are approximately 99.3 percent to 99.8 per-
cent accurate, and in 90 percent of cases, are
processed within 90 seconds.
We must be constructive and proactive in
our response to the countless mass shootings
and gun violence in our country that continue
to claim so many innocent lives.
Newly released data from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (‘‘CDC’’)
found firearm-related deaths rose for the sec-
ond-straight year in 2016, largely due to
spikes in gun violence.
In 2016, the new CDC report on preliminary
mortality data shows that there were more
than 38,000 gun-related deaths in the U.S.—
4,000 more than 2015.
An Associated Press analysis of FBI data
shows there were about 11,000 gun-related
homicides in 2016, up from 9,600 in 2015.
Congress must act to keep our country safe
through gun safety and violence deterrence.
There is nearly one mass shooting per day
in the United States—355 mass shootings in
2015.
In December 2012, a gunman walked into
Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown,
Connecticut, and killed 20 children, 6 adults,
and himself.
Since December 2012, there have been at
least 1,518 mass shootings, with at least
1,715 people killed and 6,089 wounded.
On the night of October 1, 2017, a gunman
opened fire on a large crowd of concertgoers
at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival on the
Las Vegas Strip, leaving 58 people dead and
527 injured.
On November 5, 2017, a mass shooting oc-
curred at the First Baptist Church in Suther-
land Springs, Texas, where the gunman, 26–
year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, killed 26 and in-
jured 20 others.
Every day, on average, 92 Americans are
victims of gun violence, resulting in more than
33,000 deaths annually.
States with higher gun ownership rates have
higher gun murder rates—as much as 114
percent higher than other states.
A recent study by the CDC looking at 30
years of homicide data found that for every 1
percent increase in a state’s gun ownership
rate, there is a nearly 1 percent increase in its
firearm homicide rate.
Gun death rates are generally lower in
states with restrictions such as safe storage
requirements or assault weapons bans.
Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians
in the past 33 years: 0.
This is why legislation put forward to arm
teachers is not the solution.
Stronger legislation is needed to prevent
guns from getting into the wrong hands be-
cause unfortunately, more than 75 percent of
the weapons used in mass shootings between
1982 and 2012 were obtained legally.
We must look at gun violence in its totality
to determine what are the root causes of
these alarming rates of lives cut short.
We are elected by our constituents to lead
in resolving the issues that plague our country,
and the issue of gun violence is a definite
plague across the nation.
My good friend, Houston Police Chief Art
Acevedo, gave a statement after four of his of-
ficers were shot while on duty.
He rightfully admonished us elected officials
who, so far, have accomplished absolutely
nothing about the public-health epidemic of
gun violence.
Thanks to the new Democratic majority in
Congress, we had a long overdue Gun Safety
Hearing in the Judiciary Committee.
That hearing is the first step in the legisla-
tive process of addressing the epidemic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2250 February 27, 2019
Chief Acevedo was a witness at that hear-
ing, testifying that if the proposed legislation
on background checks is enacted and saves
at least one life, then it is worth it.
I want to take this opportunity to thank my
colleague, Congressman MIKE THOMPSON, for
his leadership of the Gun Violence Prevention
Task Force and for introducing this timely and
important legislation.
Congressman THOMPSON sat in the audi-
ence during the entirety of the Gun Safety
Hearing on February 13, 2019, demonstrating
his longstanding commitment to the issue.
Also helping to bring us to this point today
is Congresswoman ROBIN KELLY of Illinois,
who represents one of the most affected dis-
tricts when it comes to gun violence.
She is a valiant leader who will not rest until
the Congress finds solutions for communities
like hers and others all over this country.
I want to thank Aalayah Eastmond, a sur-
vivor from the Parkland School Shooting, for
testifying as a witness at the House Judiciary
Gun Safety Hearing.
Her heartfelt and vivid testimony was met
with a standing ovation by the crowded audi-
ence in the hearing.
Back in my state, despite incident after inci-
dent of rampant gun violence, Texas Governor
Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken
Paxton, both prominent Republican opponents
of gun control, issued the usual statements of-
fering the usual thoughts and prayers.
Chief Acevedo said, ‘‘I appreciate your pray-
ers . . . but the question is, what are policy-
makers willing to do, besides prayers, to ad-
dress a public-health epidemic?’’
I want to answer his question—‘‘what ARE
we going to do?’’
We are going to overcome the fierce oppo-
sition from House minority members.
We are going to overcome a recalcitrant
and reluctant Senate.
And finally, we are going to overcome the
opposition of the President and the gun lobby.
I am a defender and supporter of the Con-
stitution.
I appreciate the Second Amendment and
the right that it provides our citizens.
However, I am also a defender of the right
to live, the greatest divine right of all.
I want all Americans to enjoy their Second
Amendment right, but not at the expense of
the lives of our children, students, commu-
nities, and law enforcement officials.
Imagine going to grade school in this day
and age and having to undergo ‘‘active shoot-
er’’ drills.
Imagine having children in grade school
today.
Imagine the anxiety parents feel knowing
that any day the precious lives of their children
may be interrupted by someone with an AK–
47 or AR–15.
Imagine a brighter future for America’s chil-
dren, one that does not include active shooter
drills and funerals for adolescents.
We can help make that future a reality and
we can start by voting to pass H.R. 8, the ‘‘Bi-
partisan Background Checks Act of 2019.’’
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Alabama (Mr. BYRNE).
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chair, I rise in
strong opposition to this bill. Let’s be
very clear on this: H.R. 8 will not pre-
vent criminals from getting their
hands on firearms. What H.R. 8 will do
is violate the constitutional rights of
millions of Americans.
Under this bill, almost every time a
lawful gun owner wants to transfer or
sell a gun, he or she will have to go
through a government-sanctioned
intermediary. Under this bill, no longer
could I let my cousin or my neighbor
borrow my gun. If this bill becomes
law, overnight, millions of law-abiding
gun owners could suddenly be subject
to Federal prosecution. Of course, we
all know that criminals are going to do
what they already do: make illegal
transfers of firearms.
We have heard a lot about how this is
going to be the most open Congress in
history. Well, Mr. Chair, I filed an
amendment that would strip out the
text of H.R. 8 and replace it with a na-
tionwide concealed carry reciprocity.
Mr. Chair, the Democratic leadership
blocked a vote on my amendment.
What are they so afraid of? I guess they
think they can shield their Members
from votes to protect the Second
Amendment and benefit our Nation’s
law-abiding gun owners.
Mr. Chair, I have news for the major-
ity. Gun owners of America are watch-
ing this debate. They know what H.R. 8
is all about, and they know that this is
just a sham to chip away at the Second
Amendment and our Constitution.
I will oppose this bill and any bill
that goes against the Second Amend-
ment rights of law-abiding Americans.
I urge my colleagues to join me in vot-
ing ‘‘no’’ and fighting against this as-
sault on the Second Amendment.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. LEWIS).
Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Chair, I thank my
friend, the chairman, for yielding.
Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of
this bipartisan bill. Atlanta, Chicago,
Pittsburgh, Parkland, Charleston, Oak
Creek, Newtown, Orlando, Las Vegas,
and many other places: How many
more must suffer? How many more
must die?
For years, the people spoke up. Moth-
ers called. Fathers cried. Students
marched. But Congress offered a blind
eye or a deaf ear to their cries.
Today, we say to those who begged
and pleaded for us to act that we see
you. We feel your pain. We heard your
cries, and we are going to answer
today, now.
We sat in on this floor. I want to
thank the chair of our task force, MIKE
THOMPSON, for never giving up, for
never giving in, for keeping the faith,
for keeping your eyes on the prize. We
are doing the right thing today.
We have a mission. We have an obli-
gation and a mandate to pass this bi-
partisan bill that must become public
law.
Today, I urge all my colleagues on
both sides of the aisle to vote ‘‘yes.’’ It
is good. It is the right thing to do to
save lives and to stop this madness.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the distinguished gentleman
from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON).
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair,
I rise in strong support of H.R. 8. I
commend the efforts of Congressman
MIKE THOMPSON from California for in-
troducing this commonsense legisla-
tion.
What it simply does is require that
all sales of firearms go through a li-
censed firearms dealer who has to run
a background check. Current law man-
dates that all licensed gun dealers, be-
fore transferring a weapon, have to per-
form a background check.
The problem we have in this country
is the law allows unlicensed firearms
dealers competing with licensed fire-
arms dealers to sell just as many fire-
arms as a licensed gun dealer, but
without doing the background check.
That enables criminals and people who
should not have weapons to have fire-
arms, and that contributes to the pro-
liferation of weaponry on our streets in
the hands of those who should not have
them.
It produces violence, and we are look-
ing to stop the violence with this legis-
lation, and so I ask my colleagues to
support it.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. SWALWELL).
Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr.
Chair, today, we tell our fellow Ameri-
cans that their children’s right to learn
without fear; that their own right to
dance at a concert, worship at a syna-
gogue, shop at the mall; that all those
rights to come home, to live, and to
love are greater than any other right
in the Constitution.
This bill puts in place an expansion
of violent history checks on firearm
purchases where there were too many
gaps before.
It will not end every gun violence
death in America, but we should try. It
also will get rid of this argument about
States like California and Illinois,
where you have gun violence. You can
no longer say, well, they have tough
background checks there, so it is not
working. Well, no, we are only as safe
as the lowest common denominator. If
our States like Nevada and Arizona
have low restrictions when it comes to
purchasing a firearm, we are only as
safe as they are.
We will have a nationwide back-
ground check that will make sure that
all of us are safe. We are here, Mr.
Chair, because of Mr. THOMPSON, be-
cause of Moms Demand Action, because
of Everytown for Gun Safety, and be-
cause of March For Our Lives.
Keep marching. You got us to this
point.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I
reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, how much
time is remaining?
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
New York has 91⁄4 minutes remaining.
The gentleman from Georgia has 53⁄4
minutes remaining.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I yield 1
minute to the distinguished gentleman
from Maryland (Mr. BROWN).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2251
February 27, 2019
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair,
I rise in support of H.R. 8. This bill is
long overdue. For too long, Congress
has failed to end the cycle of gun vio-
lence and death that too many families
are now familiar with.
In 2017 alone, 40,000 people died from
gun violence. Congress did nothing.
Last year, five reporters at the Capital
Gazette in my district were murdered
in cold blood in a mass shooting that
took place in their newsroom. Congress
did nothing.
Gun violence is a crisis in our com-
munities and a real national emer-
gency that will no longer be met with
inaction.
For the first time since Congress
passed the Brady Handgun Violence
Prevention Act of 1994, we will pass a
bill in pursuit of our effort to protect
our communities and end this scourge
of gun violence.
The American people overwhelm-
ingly want us to act. For the people,
we will pass universal background
checks out of the House as our first
piece of comprehensive gun safety re-
form.
Mr. Chair, today is only the begin-
ning.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I
continue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I yield 2
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN),
a member of the committee.
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Chair, I am delighted
that we are finally at this day, because
you know the tide, you know the toll
that takes place every day. On average,
every day in America, 342 people are
shot: murders, assaults, suicides, or
suicide attempts. That means every
single day—yesterday, tomorrow, and
the next day, and the next day—100
people, on average, will die of gun vio-
lence and another 200 or more will lit-
erally be wounded or shot in the cross-
fire.
We know that, in 2017, more than
39,000, nearly 40,000 people died of gun
violence, all kinds of gun violence.
That was an extraordinary uptick in
gun violence.
I carry with me today the picture of
Ben Wheeler, whose courageous mother
testified before the Pennsylvania
House of Representatives in 2014.
I carry with me today a picture of
Ron, the son of my dear friend, Marge,
who died of gun violence by suicide.
I carry with me, not by picture, but
in my heart, the 16-year-old son of my
former student at La Salle University
who was shot in random gun violence
in the city of Philadelphia.
Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of
H.R. 8. In conclusion, Mr. Chair, I long
for the day when orange ribbons are ob-
solete and when orange scarves are a
fashion statement, not a cry for help.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I
continue to reserve the balance of my
time.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania (Ms. SCAN-
LON), a member of the committee.
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Chair, just 2
weeks ago in my district, six lives and
six families were forever changed by
gun violence in a 6-day period. Four
people were killed and two were injured
in six different shootings. One person
was 28. The other five were 16, 17, and
18. They were teenagers. My heart goes
out to all of those victims’ families.
Thoughts and prayers are no longer
enough. It is long past time that our
actions speak louder than our words.
No matter which State we are from,
with over 40,000 gun violence deaths
last year, every State has been se-
verely impacted by gun violence.
The public health crisis has been po-
liticized and weaponized as a means to
divide us, despite the fact that it is a
crisis that should bind us together, and
we must come together.
b 1330
Background checks are the founda-
tion of commonsense gun policy, and
they are supported by the over-
whelming majority of Americans. Our
current system fails us in two ways,
but the bills we are looking at this
week are designed to address that.
Under current law, firearm sales can
proceed regardless if a good back-
ground check comes back within a 3-
day period, and it doesn’t capture all
the sales. So this puts an incredible
burden on law enforcement and an in-
credible burden on ATF agents who
have to go and reclaim guns that are
sold, despite the owner of the gun not
being able to pass the background
check. So for too long those in a posi-
tion to act have failed to do so. But
that ends now.
I strongly support the commonsense
gun legislation in H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair-
man, again, I agree with the sentiment
that we need to actually fashion some-
thing that will work. Unfortunately,
this, for many reasons we have already
stated, will not.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield
1 minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), who is the distin-
guished majority leader.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
My friend, the gentleman from Geor-
gia, just rose and said that this won’t
work. We have risen on this floor time
after time after time after time and
had a moment of silence followed by no
action.
As I said time after time, we have
had a moment of silence. I will tell my
friend from Georgia that it hasn’t
worked. It has been appropriate, but it
has not worked.
Can we guarantee that this will work
to make every person safe?
It cannot. It will not. But I rise in
strong support of doing something, and
in this case doing something that 90
percent of America supports.
Mr. Chairman, this House is finally
going to do its job and take action—
not just a moment of silence, but ac-
tion—to address the epidemic of gun vi-
olence in our country.
After the tragedies at Sandy Hook,
Orlando, Las Vegas, Charleston, the
Tree of Life synagogue, and Great Mills
High School in my district, the House,
under the previous leadership, did
nothing. It didn’t work.
After the shooting just down the
street at the Washington Navy Yard,
the Republican-controlled House did
nothing. Three of the victims of that
attack were constituents of mine living
in southern Maryland. Dr. Wendy Ed-
monds and Wanda Wallace are in the
gallery, Mr. Chairman. They are the
sisters of Sylvia Fraser, a Navy Yard
shooting victim.
Montana Geimer, daughter of Wendi
Winters, a writer for the Capital Ga-
zette of which my colleague, Mr.
BROWN, just spoke; and Mackenzie
Boughey, a high school student who or-
ganized a March for Our Lives rally in
Anne Arundel County, are here with us
today not to have a moment of silence,
but to have a moment of action.
Many of our districts have been pain-
fully affected by gun violence. In St.
Mary’s County in Maryland, as I told
you, Mr. Chairman, a student was
killed by a shooter at Great Mills High
School, and a courageous school re-
sources officer there saved countless
other lives. In Annapolis, five staff
members of the Capital Gazette were
gunned down in their newsroom.
For years, the American people have
demanded action to address gun vio-
lence. After the Parkland shooting,
just over a year ago, students marched
in cities from coast to coast to demand
that Congress protect them in the
classroom, in the streets, in houses of
worship, and in all public gathering
places.
I, as I am sure many of you have, had
the opportunity to meet with many of
the students who participated in the
March for Our Lives and heard the de-
termination in their voices as they
spoke about working to achieve a fu-
ture where students would no longer
have to practice active-shooter drills
in their schools. I found their courage
and persistence deeply inspiring.
Now, with a change in the majority
control, we are bringing to the floor
legislation supported by, as I said, nine
out of ten Americans, including a ma-
jority of responsible gun owners to ex-
pand criminal background checks to
make sure that those who have a
criminal past, a past of violence—do-
mestic or otherwise—a mental health
problem, or are on the no-fly list be-
cause they are perceived as possibly
terrorists, won’t be able to buy a gun.
Does that mean they won’t get a
gun?
It does not. I understand that. But as
I told my friend from Georgia, the mo-
ments of silence have not worked. They
were appropriate, I understand, but
they didn’t work.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2252 February 27, 2019
We will also be voting this week on
legislation offered by our whip, Mr.
CLYBURN, to close the loophole that
contributed to the horrific mass shoot-
ing at Mother Emanuel AME Church in
Charleston in 2015.
Mr. Chairman, I urge the Senate to
follow the House and pass the legisla-
tion we advance, and I call on the
President to sign it without delay.
Mr. Chairman, let us not have a mo-
ment of silence for this legislation. Do
not let it die. Do not let the hope that
it provides die. Do not let us stand by
one more time to lament the death of
a constituent, a friend, a neighbor, a
fellow citizen, who dies at the hand of
a gun purchased illegally or by some-
one who should not have a gun.
This is not about taking away guns.
It is about preventing guns getting in
the hands of people who do bad things,
and we can predict that they are a dan-
ger to others. Let us not have a mo-
ment of silence for this bill. Let us pass
it. Let the Senate pass it. Let the
President sign it. Let’s make an effort
at least to stop the carnage.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the words
of the majority leader. However, I will
say that in the previous Congress, this
Congress did pass Fix NICS. It also
passed the STOP School Violence Act.
I am sure, among other reasons, it is
probably why the majority leader
voted against those bills in which they
were included.
I do agree with him. The moments of
silence may not have stopped, but it
did call upon a higher power to realize
that we are fragile human beings in-
volved in tragedies. I will also remind
the folks, and Mr. Chairman, yourself,
that this bill will also not do what it
has many times been promoted for it to
do, because any of these mass violence
episodes would not have been affected
by this bill.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.
SCALISE).
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Chairman, I rise
in strong opposition to these gun con-
trol bills that are being brought for-
ward. They are brought forward under
the guise of background checks.
Let’s look at what these bills would
actually do. We had identified any
number of problems with this bill that
we were trying to improve, and every
one of those was shut out, shut out by
the Democratic majority who wanted
to try to stifle the opposing side’s de-
bate because they think just saying
background checks makes this a good
bill.
Let’s talk about what this bill will do
to make criminals—felons—out of law-
abiding citizens. If you loan your gun
to a friend under this bill, maybe they
are thinking of buying a similar gun to
protect themselves and they want to go
to a shooting range to see if this gun is
the right kind of gun to protect them-
selves with, which they have a right to
do under the Second Amendment of
this Constitution, loaning your gun to
that friend in that act would make you
a felon subject to a year in jail and
subject to a $100,000 fine, Mr. Chair-
man.
We tried to fix that. They shut that
amendment out.
In this bill, if you loan your gun to a
friend who maybe has been a victim of
domestic violence—and one of my col-
leagues who is here in opposition to
this bill is one of those victims of do-
mestic violence. She had an amend-
ment to fix this bill to say, if she has
got a temporary restraining order
against her boyfriend who has been
beating her and she is afraid he is
going to come back tonight, under one
of the bills, if she goes to buy a gun to-
night and the Fix NICS system isn’t
working, she may have 20 business days
to get that gun.
Now, good luck if the boyfriend
shows up to beat her up that night and
she says: Don’t worry, I am on day 8. I
only have another 12 days before I can
buy the gun. Will you come back so I
can defend myself then?
Do you really think that is going to
happen?
You know what that means to her.
So in the bill we said: What if you
can loan your gun to her?
She goes to a friend and says: I know
you have a gun. I don’t have a gun. I
am trying to protect myself because I
have got a TRO, but I know he is prob-
ably going to come back.
Under this bill, you will be a felon, a
year in jail, $100,000 fine. We tried to
fix that, too, Mr. Chairman, and they
shut that amendment out. That is what
this bill does.
Oh, by the way, we are talking about
law-abiding citizens here. If you go
hunting with a buddy and you try to
loan your gun to a buddy, Mr. Chair-
man, they say there is an exemption in
the bill. But it is written so vaguely
that you not only need to bring your
hunting partner, you might need to
bring your attorney to find out if loan-
ing your shotgun to your friend makes
you a felon under this bill.
These are law-abiding citizens. These
are people who use guns to defend
themselves, which is the basis of the
Second Amendment. Our Founding Fa-
thers believed every American has the
right to defend themselves, because
every day, on average, in this country
guns are used by good people to defend
themselves against bad people, and it is
going to make it harder for them to get
access to these guns to defend them-
selves. So, again, we tried to fix some
of these problems.
Mr. Chairman, let me tell you about
another problem we tried to identify
and fix. If you loan your gun, you will
be a felon.
The CHAIR. The time of the gen-
tleman has expired.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield the gentleman from Lou-
isiana an additional 30 seconds.
Mr. SCALISE. So now we have iden-
tified areas where law-abiding citizens
can become felons. We tried to fix it;
they wanted that to stay in place.
So what is that motivation?
But then we identified another prob-
lem. If someone who is in this country
illegally goes to buy a gun and the sys-
tem flags them, and it says: Wait a
minute, this person is not even here le-
gally. They are breaking Federal law
trying to buy a gun. We said that we
should notify ICE so at least our Bor-
der Patrol agents in the interior can
deport them. They blocked that
amendment.
So now a law-abiding citizen can be-
come a felon under their bill, but some-
one who is here illegally trying to buy
a gun in violation of the law can’t be
turned over to authorities. This is a
bad gun control bill, and we ought to
reject it.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I just
want to point out the penalty in this
bill that is being cited as $100,000 is in
fact $1,000.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair-
man, I request of the chairman: Does
he have any more speakers at this
time?
Mr. NADLER. Yes, I have one more.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair-
man, I reserve the balance of my time.
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE CHAIR
The CHAIR. The Chair will remind
all persons in the gallery that they are

any manifestation of approval or dis-
approval of proceedings is in violation
of the rules of the House.
Members are reminded to avoid ref-
erencing occupants of the gallery.

Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. THOMPSON), who is the dis-
tinguished author of the bill.
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr.
Chair, I thank the gentleman for yield-
ing.
I was asked to talk about some of the
outrageous allegations that were made
about this bill, and the chairman al-
ready cleared one up, and that is the
$100,000 fine that we are hearing from
the other side. It is $1,000, as was point-
ed out.
We also heard that this isn’t con-
stitutional. Well, the Constitution is
pretty clear: Individuals have a right
to bear arms. Nobody is disputing that.
As a matter of fact, it was settled in
District of Columbia v. Heller.
But also in that opinion were Justice
Scalia’s remarks that stated that gov-
ernment also has a responsibility and a
right to regulate firearms. That is all
we are doing.
We are saying that people who are
felons, domestic abusers, dangerously
mentally ill, a danger to themselves or
others shouldn’t be able to have guns. I
don’t think anybody can dispute that.
And how do you find out if you don’t do
a background check?
My friends on the other side of the
aisle said this won’t work. We have

heard it a hundred times: This won’t
work. Well, we have been working on
this for 61⁄2 years, ever since Sandy
Hook. We have pleaded with the other
side to work with us, have a hearing.
What are your ideas?
Absolute silence from them. Absolute
silence.
This does work. We know that li-
censed dealers stop the sale of firearms
to 170 felons every day and 50 domestic
abusers every day because they are re-
quired to do background checks.
But in some States, that same indi-
vidual can be found to be prohibited,
walk outside and go to a gun show or
go online and buy a gun without the
benefit of a background check—and
that is wrong.
Countless speakers from the other
side of the aisle said this wouldn’t have
stopped this crime, this wouldn’t have
stopped this mass shooting, this
wouldn’t have stopped that mass shoot-
ing. Well, my friends, if that is your
standard, if you will only support a bill
that will stop every mass shooting,
that will stop every death by a firearm,
that means you want to get rid of all
guns, and no one on this side of the
aisle is saying that.
The CHAIR. The time of the gen-
tleman has expired.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I yield the
gentleman an additional 1 minute.
Mr. THOMPSON of California. The
only way you can ensure that there
will never be another person murdered
by someone with a gun is to do away
with all guns. We recognized that from
day one.
Numerous speakers have said, just
today on this floor, this will not stop
every death. But it will stop some, and
it is certainly worth pursuing.
I urge your ‘‘aye’’ vote.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair-
man, is this now the final speaker?
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I am pre-
pared to close.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I
am prepared to close as well.
Mr. Chair, before I close, I would like
to say that I agree with the statement
from the gentleman just now that
there are maybe the ones turned away
every day. The problem is there are
only 60 a year prosecuted for what is a
crime. This doesn’t address that.
Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my
time to the gentleman from North
Carolina (Mr. BUDD), a licensed fire-
arms dealer.
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Chair, I thank my
friend from Georgia (Mr. COLLINS) for
allowing me the time.
I rise today in opposition to H.R. 8
and want to lay out a couple of reasons
for my opposition.
Before I do, I think it is important to
acknowledge how polarizing this de-
bate has become over the last several
years. More specifically, I want this
body to know that, as a human being,
as an American, as a father, when I see
the heartbreaking news of a mass
shooting like the one we saw just 54
weeks ago in Parkland, it just breaks
my heart.
With that being said, this bill that
we are voting on today would not have
done anything to stop that tragedy
from happening, nor would it have pre-
vented any of those recent mass shoot-
ings.
The 19-year-old murderer in Parkland
passed a background check.
The man who murdered 26 innocent
people at First Baptist Church in Suth-
erland Springs also passed a back-
ground check, although he wouldn’t
have if the Air Force had passed along
his criminal information like they
were supposed to have done.
And the evil that took place in Sandy
Hook wouldn’t have been stopped by
this bill either. The killer used his
mother’s guns to kill her and 26 others.
They were bought legally.
Mr. Chairman, the simple fact is that
criminals don’t abide by the law, and
this would only create traps for law-
abiding gun owners.
However, there are actions that we
can take, actions that we can do, that
would make meaningful strides in com-
bating the violence that we see today.
One example of something we could
do, improve information sharing be-
tween law enforcement officials across
this country.
Mr. Chair, to close, I disagree with
the policy of this bill.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self the balance of my time.
Mr. Chair, we have heard the other
side here say that some people lie on
the forms; they are not prosecuted.
Well, that may be, and maybe law en-
forcement ought to prosecute more
people.
That doesn’t negate the necessity for
the bill. It doesn’t negate the fact that
too many people who shouldn’t have
guns, who are mentally unstable, who
have committed crimes, and who are
abusers get guns because they buy a
gun at a gun show or not from a reg-
istered gun dealer and, therefore, do
not have to undergo a background
check.
Everyone who gets a gun should have
to undergo a background check, with
the few exceptions we put in the bill.
Mr. Chairman, H.R. 8 is legislation
that is long overdue for passage by this
body and for enactment so that we can
take a critical step overwhelmingly
supported by the American people to
protect us from gun violence.
We have had too many moments of
silence, too many expressions of sym-
pathy, too many deaths—39,000 deaths
from guns last year—but little action
here in Congress on this issue.
Today we act. I urge my colleagues
to vote in support of this vital bill to
start taking back our streets from the
killers, to start blocking people who
shouldn’t have them from having guns.
Save our lives.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Chair, when
I voted for the Brady Law in 1993—which took
effect on February 28, 1994—it was to keep
firearms out of the hands of dangerous per-
sons including felons and abusers.
Twenty-five years later—and 300 million
background checks that have blocked 3 million
purchases to dangerous individuals—few if
any today seriously suggest that the Brady law
should be repealed.
I support the Second Amendment. Universal
background checks prescribed in H.R. 8 are
an attempt to ensure that firearms are pro-
cured, owned and used by responsible, law
abiding citizens.
According to the Brady Campaign, about 1
in 5 guns now sold in America are done so
without a background check. That’s a signifi-
cant loophole.
According to the CDC, there was a record
39,773 deaths from firearms in 2017—higher
than in any other year—23,854 were self-in-
flicted and 14,542 were homicides.
To mitigate gun violence in America, H.R. 8
expands Brady background checks to trans-
actions by private sellers not currently covered
by the law.
Multiple school shootings have led to robust,
comprehensive action at every level to make
classrooms safer. I have visited many schools
in my district—and I have found that while the
threat is being taken seriously, no one policy,
program or initiative can ensure the level of
protection our students need and deserve.
Mr. Chair, no constitutional right is absolute
including the Second Amendment. The First
Amendment’s freedom of speech, for example,
has reasonable limits including the promulga-
tion of slander and libel law.
To preserve public order, we accept reason-
able restrictions on the freedom to assemble.
Even freedom of religion isn’t without some
modest boundaries.
In like manner, universal background checks
don’t erode Second Amendment rights but do
help ensure much needed protection from gun
violence for everyone.
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chair, I rise today in
strong support of H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Back-
ground Checks Act.
This year, my State of the Union guest was
Alexandria Goddard, a young activist who
helped organize Portland’s March for Our
Lives.
Alexandria led thousands of Oregonians in a
march to demand that Congress take action to
prevent gun violence.
By passing this bill we are heeding the call
of the hundreds of thousands of students who
marched for their lives.
They know—and we know—that this bill will
save lives because it requires a background
check for nearly all firearm sales and trans-
fers.
The evidence shows that Oregon and the
other states that have already passed com-
prehensive background checks have 35 per-
cent fewer gun deaths, and 47 percent fewer
women shot by their intimate partners.
Congress is finally doing more than offering
thoughts and prayers.
We are acting. We are acting for Parkland,
for Sandy Hook, for Umpqua Community Col-
lege, and for the hundreds of thousands of
victims and survivors around the country.

common sense bipartisan legislation would ex-
pand the current firearm background check
system to cover all commercial firearm sales
nationwide.
Our nation is currently enduring a crisis that
is putting families and communities at risk.
Gun violence has become so commonplace in
our society that we no longer seem to flinch
whenever these events occur. Gun violence
threatens national security and inflicts a toll.
125,000 people are shot every year and more
than 36,000 people die as a result of these
shootings. A 2018 report conducted by the
Centers for Disease Control & Prevention re-
vealed that there were 3,353 firearm-related
deaths in my home state of Texas. 352 of
these were children and teenagers under 19
years old. Texas unfortunately has played host
to some of the most viscous recent mass
shootings, such as the 2009 Fort Hood shoot-
ing, the Dallas police officer shooting in 2016,
the Plano and Sutherland Springs Church
shootings in 2017, and last year’s Santa Fe
High School shooting.
We have high levels of gun violence in this
country because we have weak laws that are
riddled with loopholes. This bill will not only
eliminate those loopholes, but it will do so
without infringing upon second amendment
rights. Implementing universal background
checks is supported by 97 percent of Ameri-
cans, including 97 percent of gun owners.
The reality is that gun safety laws will re-
duce violence and we must do everything in
our power to prevent the reoccurrence of un-
necessary tragedy and loss of life in this coun-
try. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
The CHAIR. All time for general de-
bate has expired.
Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be
considered for amendment under the 5-
minute rule.
In lieu of the amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute recommended by
the Committee on the Judiciary, print-
ed in the bill, it shall be in order to
consider as an original bill for the pur-
pose of amendment under the 5-minute
rule an amendment in the nature of a
substitute consisting of the text of
Rules Committee Print 116–5. That
amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute shall be considered as read.
The text of the amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute is as follows:
H.R. 8
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Bipartisan
Background Checks Act of 2019’’.
SEC. 2. PURPOSE.
The purpose of this Act is to utilize the cur-
rent background checks process in the United
States to ensure individuals prohibited from gun
possession are not able to obtain firearms.
SEC. 3. FIREARMS TRANSFERS.
Section 922 of title 18, United States Code, is
amended—
(1) by striking subsection (s);
(2) by redesignating subsection (t) as sub-
section (s); and
(3) by inserting after subsection (s), as redesig-
nated, the following:
‘‘(t)(1)(A) It shall be unlawful for any person
who is not a licensed importer, licensed manu-
facturer, or licensed dealer to transfer a firearm
to any other person who is not so licensed, un-
less a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer,
or licensed dealer has first taken possession of
the firearm for the purpose of complying with
subsection (s).
‘‘(B) Upon taking possession of a firearm
under subparagraph (A), a licensee shall comply
with all requirements of this chapter as if the li-

‘‘(C) If a transfer of a firearm described in
subparagraph (A) will not be completed for any
reason after a licensee takes possession of the
firearm (including because the transfer of the
firearm to, or receipt of the firearm by, the
transferee would violate this chapter), the re-
turn of the firearm to the transferor by the li-
censee shall not constitute the transfer of a fire-
arm for purposes of this chapter.
‘‘(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to—
‘‘(A) a law enforcement agency or any law en-
forcement officer, armed private security profes-
sional, or member of the armed forces, to the ex-
tent the officer, professional, or member is act-
ing within the course and scope of employment
and official duties;

trustee, or personal representative of an estate
or a trust that occurs by operation of law upon
the death of another person;
‘‘(D) a temporary transfer that is necessary to
prevent imminent death or great bodily harm, if
the possession by the transferee lasts only as
long as immediately necessary to prevent the im-
minent death or great bodily harm;
‘‘(E) a transfer that is approved by the Attor-
ney General under section 5812 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986; or
‘‘(F) a temporary transfer if the transferor has
no reason to believe that the transferee will use
or intends to use the firearm in a crime or is pro-
hibited from possessing firearms under State or
Federal law, and the transfer takes place and
the transferee’s possession of the firearm is ex-
clusively—
‘‘(i) at a shooting range or in a shooting gal-
lery or other area designated for the purpose of
target shooting;
‘‘(ii) while reasonably necessary for the pur-
poses of hunting, trapping, or fishing, if the
transferor—
‘‘(I) has no reason to believe that the trans-
feree intends to use the firearm in a place where
it is illegal; and
‘‘(II) has reason to believe that the transferee
will comply with all licensing and permit re-
quirements for such hunting, trapping, or fish-
ing; or
‘‘(iii) while in the presence of the transferor.
‘‘(3)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision
of this chapter, the Attorney General may im-
plement this subsection with regulations.
‘‘(B) Regulations promulgated under this
paragraph may not include any provision re-
quiring licensees to facilitate transfers in ac-
cordance with paragraph (1).

tion under paragraph (1), and such other person
has certified that such other person has been
provided with this notice on a form prescribed
by the Attorney General.’’.

AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MRS. LESKO
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 1 printed in part
A of House Report 116–14.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Chairman, I have
an amendment at the desk.
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate
the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:

Page 4, line 15, strike the period and insert
‘‘; or’’.
Page 4, after line 15, insert the following:
‘‘(G) a transfer to a participant in the Pre-
Check or successor trusted traveler program
of the Department of Homeland Security.’’.
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 145, the gentlewoman from Ari-
zona (Mrs. LESKO) and a Member op-
posed each will control 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Arizona.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Chairman, this
amendment would allow gun owners to
legally transfer their firearms to indi-
viduals who have been approved and
are participants in TSA’s PreCheck
program.
TSA PreCheck identifies trusted
travelers and, thus, allows expedited
movement through airport security. In
order to receive TSA PreCheck, one
must submit an application, have an
in-person interview, and go through a
background check and fingerprinting.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2255
February 27, 2019
Fingerprinting is not required, cur-
rently, to purchase a gun; thus, a TSA
PreCheck background check is more
stringent. If an individual can pass this
background check and be admitted to
this Federal Government program,
there is no reason why they shouldn’t
be able to borrow a firearm from a
friend. They have already gone through
a more extensive background check
system than to acquire a weapon. The
current background check does not re-
quire fingerprints; a TSA PreCheck
does.
Membership to TSA PreCheck must
be renewed every 5 years. Again, the
TSA PreCheck process requires finger-
prints and an in-person interview. The
process, currently, for purchasing a
gun requires neither of those under
Federal law. It appears, then, that the
TSA PreCheck process is a more exten-
sive process.
H.R. 8 restricts not only the pur-
chase, but also the everyday gun trans-
fer for law-abiding citizens. This
amendment and many other Repub-
lican amendments—I think I had five
others that were not made in order—
seek to give some relief to law-abiding
citizens from this overarching and bur-
densome legislation.
In H.R. 8, we are not only talking
about the purchase of firearms, we are
talking about the transfer of firearms,
which includes lending your firearm.
The Democrats have proposed a bill
that would criminalize millions of law-
abiding Americans. Because this bill
uses ambiguous, overarching, and
vague language, it encompasses so
many potential situations. This
amendment seeks to give some relief.
If we are going to allow Americans to
be given expedited and reduced screen-
ing in our most sensitive and secure
environments in the U.S. airport get-
ting on a plane, why wouldn’t we allow
them to lend a gun to their friend?
H.R. 8 criminalizes me and others
just for handing someone a firearm
who isn’t a direct family member or in
other very narrow situations. In fact,
as I said yesterday, the language in
this bill is so ambiguous. What is ‘‘im-
minent danger’’? There is no definition
in the bill.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I rise in op-
position to the amendment.
The CHAIR. The gentleman from
New York is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I rise in op-
position to this amendment because it
is fatally flawed and would undermine
the public safety impact of the bill.
The amendment would add an excep-
tion to the background check require-
ment for anyone who is a participant
in the TSA PreCheck program by the
Department of Homeland Security.
By exempting those who have ob-
tained a TSA PreCheck from the back-
ground check requirement, the amend-
ment would allow many dangerous peo-
ple, including people with disqualifying
mental health conditions and some
criminal convictions, to obtain fire-
arms without a background check.
The current background system, the
National Instant Criminal Background
Check System, was designed specifi-
cally for background checks pursuant
to the Brady Handgun Violence Pre-
vention Act.
The system, often called the NICS,
contains the information that no other
Federal database contains, and the
TSA does not check NICS when deter-
mining a person’s eligibility for the
TSA PreCheck program.
Although participants in the TSA
PreCheck program have had their
criminal backgrounds vetted, the
standards for approval and participa-
tion in the TSA PreCheck program are
not the same and, in many cases, are
more lenient than those which prohibit
firearm possession and purchase.
For example, the NICS searches the
records of people prohibited for mental
health reasons during a firearms back-
ground check. These mental health
reasons, though, are not part of the
TSA PreCheck search.
As of January 31, there are more than
5.7 million of these mental health
records in the NICS indexes, making it
the second most populous category of
prohibited records for firearm pur-
chase.
Because the Department of Homeland
Security does not have access to these
mental health records for TSA
PreCheck program purposes, individ-
uals who have been adjudicated to be
disqualified to own firearms for reasons
of mental condition or have been com-
mitted to any mental institution may
be accepted under the TSA PreCheck
program but are not legally able to
possess a gun. Under this amendment,
they would be legally exempted from
the background check requirement and
would be able to get a gun, despite
being legally prohibited from doing so.
The TSA bars people convicted of
certain criminal offenses, such as rape
or aggravated sexual abuse, from par-
ticipating in the TSA PreCheck pro-
gram only temporarily. It doesn’t re-
strict people convicted of these serious
crimes for more than 7 years, and it
wouldn’t bar people released from pris-
on for these crimes within the last 5
years.
Under current law, these felony con-
victions prohibit possession or pur-
chase of a weapon, but, under this
amendment, people released from pris-
on within the last 5 years for these
crimes could get the weapons—could
get the weapons.
The TSA PreCheck program does not
have a minimum age requirement, and
this amendment would allow people
under the ages of 18 and 21 to purchase
firearms illegally and without a NICS
background check.
Furthermore, the TSA PreCheck pro-
gram only requires a background check
every 5 years, and the PreCheck sys-
tem may not be advised that a firearms
disqualifying offense has taken place
after the initial PreCheck background
check has occurred.
In other words, you get the TSA
PreCheck, and if you are convicted
afterwards, within 5 years, for a very
serious crime, under this amendment,
you could get the gun, although, le-
gally, you shouldn’t without a back-
ground check, and the TSA PreCheck
program would not have picked it up.
b 1400
These shortcomings of the TSA
PreCheck system make it an inad-
equate and dangerous substitute for a
NICS background check. To prevent
potentially prohibited purchasers from
obtaining firearms, licensed dealers
should conduct background checks on
participants in the PreCheck program
as they would with any other member
of the public.
The blanket exception of this amend-
ment for anyone who participates in
the TSA PreCheck program would un-
dermine the bill’s ability to enhance
public safety because it would enable
people convicted of serious crimes, peo-
ple adjudicated to have serious mental
illnesses, to purchase guns without a
background check, even though the
TSA system would not pick them up.
The TSA system is not a substitute
for the background check system. It
doesn’t pick up many of the crimes. It
doesn’t carry it forward. And it is not
a substitute for this system.
To pass this amendment, which
would allow people who have qualified
under the TSA PreCheck program not
to have background checks, would
allow a lot of people who shouldn’t
have guns to have them. Therefore, I
strongly oppose this amendment, and I
ask that my colleagues vote ‘‘no’’ on
this amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Chair, I yield 30
seconds to the gentleman from Georgia
(Mr. COLLINS).
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair-
man, I won’t take even the 30 seconds.
I just support the amendment. I think
it is good. Many of the flaws that we
have seen in this bill so far, this is an
amendment that actually works.
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Chair, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. NADLER, in his statement, said
that my amendment would allow dan-
gerous people to get guns. I have to say
I disagree.
I am the ranking member on the
Committee on Homeland Security sub-
committee that deals with TSA, and
the TSA PreCheck system is more
stringent than the background check
currently required to obtain a gun,
when you purchase it. Again, it re-
quires a fingerprint background check
and an individual interview. Neither of
those are required right now.
We had offered a number of amend-
ments to help this bill become less bur-
densome on law-abiding citizens, and
so I am happy that one was at least
ruled in order, this TSA one, and I
would ask my colleagues to please vote
‘‘yes’’ on it.

cluding harm to self, family, household
members, or others,’’.

House Resolution 145, the gentlewoman
from Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania.
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself
such time as I may consume.
I rise to offer an amendment to H.R.
8, the Bipartisan Background Checks
Act of 2019. My amendment clarifies
that those at risk of committing sui-
cide would be exempt from the back-
ground check requirement in instances
of imminent threats of death or great
bodily harm.
Specifically, this legislation amends
the bill to insert the line ‘‘including
harm to self, family, household mem-
bers, or others’’ to the list of instances
when a person is exempt from the
background check requirement and
may temporarily transfer away a fire-
arm for safekeeping.
The spirit of this long overdue legis-
lation is to save lives, and I urge my
colleagues to support my amendment,
which will further achieve this goal by
addressing the leading instance of gun
death in this country, suicide.
Last year, nearly 40,000 people were
killed by gun violence, with another
80,000 literally caught in the crossfire.
Of those killed, over half, more than
20,000, people tragically died by gun
suicide.
And the problem has grown. Nation-
ally, over the past years, the past dec-
ade, the rate of suicide by gun death
has increased 19 percent. This is a prob-
lem that grips our entire Nation.
In my home State of Pennsylvania,
there has been a 24 percent increase in
gun suicides over the past 10 years,
claiming the lives of over 14,000 people.
These are our friends, our loved ones,
young and old, people for whom our
hearts ache, people we wish we could
hold just one more time.
I offer up a picture of a dear friend of
my family, Ron.
Unfortunately, very few of us are left
unscathed by this problem. While there
are many factors that contribute to
self-harm, the presence of a firearm in
the home increases the risk of suicide.
Not surprisingly, using a gun is the
method that most often ends in death.
Guns are dangerously effective at
what they are designed to do. That is
why this amendment is so important.
It ensures that those in crisis can tem-
porarily transfer a firearm safely until
the crisis has passed. It clearly defines
that a person can temporarily hand
over firearms to someone they trust
while they work through this difficult
time.
This clarity is needed because, in
times of crisis, moments matter. It
may literally be the difference between
life and death.
We are here today at a historic mo-
ment to take action against the vio-
lence that plagues this country, our
communities, and our loved ones. The
Bipartisan Background Checks Act of
2019, with this amendment, will keep
guns out of the hands of those who le-
gally should not have them and also
gives those who need a safe way to sep-
arate themselves from their guns a way
to do so.
If we have the courage to pass this
legislation, the courage here in the
House and in the Senate and in the
White House, it will do just that. It
will save lives.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I
claim time in opposition.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman
from Georgia is recognized for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair-
man, I appreciate the willingness of the
amendment, I think, but I rise in that,
again, this is something discussed at
committee. It was an attempt to—it is
basically a failed attempt to fix one of
the shortcomings of this legislation.
I understand why they would bring
it. I understand why they would want
to fix it, because its existence indicates
what we have been saying about the
flaws in the bill, which we discussed at
committee.
Like other floor amendments that
are going to be offered, this is nothing
more than trying to basically change
the appearance of what is a flawed per-
ception. The problem here is it address-
es the undefined term of ‘‘imminent’’
used in the bill.
Mr. Chairman, it is well known, and
I have spoken about it many times,
that I am still currently serving as a
United States Air Force chaplain. I
have pastored for many years, and I
have been on the other end of phone
calls from those who were struggling
and thinking of taking their life.
Suicide is not something that we can
define very easily. It is not something
that we can simply limit to: Yes, guns
are effective. But any method that
someone uses to choose to end their
life is sad and a struggle for those of us
who have dealt with this.
The term ‘‘imminent’’ here is prob-
lematic for those of us who have dealt
with those who are struggling with sui-
cide because imminent to them and im-
minent to a judge and imminent to
someone who wants to take his life,
and to law enforcement, indicates
something precipitous that will happen
in a very short amount of time, a very
imminent act, something that is
maybe going to happen, Mr. Chairman,
even before I finish my speech. That is
an imminent kind of act.
Imminent does not extend to 12 hours
or 24 hours or even 46 hours. That
would not fall under the definition of
‘‘imminent.’’ And I am not willing to
let a prosecutor or a judge who may
not like guns, who would actually say
that was an imminent threat, and by
transferring it for more than a short
amount of time, you have then fallen
under and fall under this.
Now, I would hope that would never
happen, Mr. Chairman. But we have to
be serious about this issue of immi-
nence. For those of us who have dealt
with this, there may be, and I have had
times when people would come to me
and they were thinking about harming
themselves, but the imminence factor
was not there. They were just trying to
see if they could clear their head. It
may be a week that would pass, and
they came back and would say it was
fine.
But in this issue, I understand the in-
tent and the heart here, but it is a very
weak attempt to fix problems that we
had already pointed out in this bill.
And it will still not fix the problem, be-
cause the problem is the imminent
standard. That is the part that we are
struggling with.
We can disagree about this, and I will
respect the gentlewoman if she dis-
agrees, and would expect her to. But
let’s remember, this is carried out, if,
say—which I would hope would not
happen—this bill actually becomes law.
It then will present a problem for those
who have to enforce it and those judges
who would have to interpret it.
We have to remember that our ac-
tions here, we vote on words on paper,
not aspirational ideas. Those are happy
thoughts, not words on paper. The only
thing that the courts can do is vote on
words on paper.
I appreciate the gentlewoman bring-
ing this. I support the intent, espe-
cially dealing with suicide, which
many of us have worked on, and the
tragedy that it leaves in the wake of so
many. But please understand my oppo-
sition to this is it is still a flawed prod-
uct because we have not dealt with the
very issue of imminence in this legisla-
tion and this amendment.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from New
York (Mr. NADLER).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2257
February 27, 2019
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I sup-
port the amendment, which clarifies
the bill’s exemption for the background
check requirement in instances of im-
minent threats or great bodily harm
would apply to someone who is at risk
of committing suicide.
The amendment makes clear that the
limited number of exemptions to the
background check requirement include
circumstances in which someone feels
that they are a danger to themselves.
They may temporarily transfer a fire-
arm until the danger has passed. This
is a limited and reasonable exemption
that only applies to those who fear
they will harm themselves, so that
they may temporary surrender their
weapon.
I listened to the gentleman from
Georgia, and I appreciate he doesn’t
think that the amendment goes far
enough or solves the underlying prob-
lems of the bill, as he sees it. But even
from his point of view, it should go in
the right direction. So I urge everyone
to support this amendment.
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, I thank the author of
this bill, Representative THOMPSON,
and I thank all the tireless advocates
who have worked to bring us to this
day.
I thank the good gentleman from
Georgia for his comments. Clearly, he
understands the gravity and the grave
nature of gun death by suicide in this
country. As you can see, that number
has been escalating over the past 10
years. That includes more than 20,000
people in a single year.
Gun violence by suicide is quite dead-
ly. We know it, and so I thank my col-
league from the other side of the aisle
for at least supporting the spirit of
what we are trying to do here.
For the greater safety of our citizens,
our neighbors, our friends, and our
family members, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment and please
support this bill, H.R. 8.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.
DEAN).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 3 OFFERED BY MS. KENDRA S.
HORN OF OKLAHOMA
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 3 printed in
part A of House Report 116–14.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at
the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 3, line 14, insert ‘‘, including the
harm of domestic violence, dating partner
violence, sexual assault, stalking, and do-
mestic abuse’’ before the semicolon.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 145, the gentlewoman
from Oklahoma (Ms. KENDRA S. HORN)
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Oklahoma.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time
as I may consume.
H.R. 8 is a critical piece of legislation
that I am proud to support. Congress
needs to act to cut down on our Na-
tion’s widespread gun violence. We
must close loopholes that give buyers
and sellers a way around background
checks. There is no reason vendors at
gun shows or online should be exempt
from the safety measures other mer-
chants must obey. We should also vet
sales between two people.
That is not to say that there should
be no exceptions. My amendment
carves out protections for people who
face risk of domestic violence, dating
partner violence, sexual assault, stalk-
ing, and domestic abuse.
The underlying bill, H.R. 8, already
creates an exception to the background
check requirement when there is a
temporary weapon transfer, if the
transferee is at imminent risk of death
or great bodily harm. Our amendment
is meant to make it crystal clear and
explicit that this exception applies
when the transferees are protecting
themselves from an abuser. It does not
expand the underlying exception; it of-
fers one critical example of where it
might apply.
b 1415
When I talked to Oklahomans across
my district last year, they confided in
me their concerns about gun violence. I
promised to work towards policies that
would protect them.
We need to protect our Second
Amendment right, but there is no cred-
ible reason why we as a state and na-
tion can’t acknowledge there are steps
we can take to save lives and find a
path forward to do so.
H.R. 8 does just that. It increases
safety without limiting our Second
Amendment rights by implementing
commonsense policy.
But when we take these common-
sense steps, we need to acknowledge
our power to create unintended con-
sequences, and to prevent them.
That is why I am offering this
amendment. In addition to my com-
mitment to gun safety, I have talked
about my devotion to helping protect
women and families.
Between 1998 and 2017, the Oklahoma
Domestic Violence Fatality Review
Board found nearly 1,700 people were
killed in our State because of domestic
violence. In 2017 alone, 91 Oklahomans
were murdered.
The National Intimate Partner and
Sexual Violence Survey found that
nearly two in five Oklahoma women
will face some form of domestic abuse
or sexual violence during their life-
times.
Oklahoma is consistently ranked in
the top five States for women killed by
men in one-on-one homicides.
Oklahoma domestic violence pro-
grams serve an average of 18,000 people
annually, according to the YWCA.
Oklahoma is not an exception. These
problems persist. One in four women
and one in nine men experience inti-
mate partner physical violence; these
people deserve to be protected.
For us, that means many things, in-
cluding strengthening and reauthor-
izing the Violence Against Women Act
and investing in support services and
family justice centers. But it also
means we need to empower people to
protect themselves.
That is why Congress should pass
laws to strengthen background checks
and create exceptions for those who
truly need them.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair-
man, I claim the time in opposition to
the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair-
man, again, I understand the need or
want to do this is to make many things
that actually came in discussions in
our committee about some of the prob-
lems that we found here, and the mere
submission is another tacit admission
that the Democrats understand the
flaws in this bill.
Mr. Chairman, it is not something
that I am going to relitigate here, but
also, when debate is cut short, this is
what happens when you get to the
floor. When debate is cut short in com-
mittee, this is what happens.
They realize that good products were
brought up, but yet they chose to push
through a bill because they had a
timeline.
We went through this in the Rules
Committee. I get it. This is what is
coming up. But, again, to put this in,
‘‘great bodily harm,’’ it is minimally
helpful at this point. It goes back to
the problem we had with ‘‘imminent’’
in the last one.
These are all things, frankly, that
could have been—even in a bill that I
would disagree with at the end of the
day on this—this is, again, not some-
thing that is going to fix it. A victim of
domestic abuse can live in constant
fear of her abuser and feel threatened
at all times.
Again, Mr. Chairman, I understand at
least the attempt to fix something, be-
cause they understand that there were
problems and they don’t want to make
it worse, but I have advocated all along
that what this does help, it also hurts.
And this is, again, just another at-
tempt to do that.
I appreciate that they are figuring
out the problems now; I just would op-
pose this amendment, because, again,
it does not completely fix the problems
that we have seen, and would not in the
bigger picture.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2258 February 27, 2019
may consume to the gentlewoman from
Kansas (Ms. DAVIDS).
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise today to voice my support
for this amendment to H.R. 8 intro-
duced by Representatives HORN and
MURPHY.
This amendment protects people fac-
ing the threat of domestic violence,
dating partner violence, sexual assault,
stalking, and domestic abuse.
I am the daughter of a military vet-
eran, and like most Kansans, I respect
the Second Amendment rights of law-
abiding citizens. But also, like most
Kansans, I am tired of politicians doing
nothing to stop senseless killings.
That is why I support commonsense
solutions to keep our communities
safe, like expanding background checks
and closing dangerous loopholes in our
laws.
In our effort to ensure the safety of
our communities, however, we can’t
forget the needs of those at risk of do-
mestic violence to protect themselves
from abuse.
According to the Kansas Bureau of
Investigation, in 2017 a domestic vio-
lence incident was reported every 23
minutes and a domestic violence mur-
der occurred every 9 days in the State
of Kansas.
In the United States, more than 12
million people experience some form of
domestic violence by a current or
former domestic partner every year.
These women and men deserve our
support, which means we also need to
reauthorize and strengthen the Vio-
lence Against Women Act.
These men and women deserve to be
protected. I cannot emphasize that
enough.
Mr. Chair, I am proud to support H.R.
8. It is a critical piece of legislation
that will save lives, and I urge my fel-
low colleagues to stand up for sur-
vivors and those at risk and support
this amendment.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 15 seconds to the
gentleman from New York (Mr. NAD-
LER).
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentlewoman for yielding.
Mr. Chair, I simply want to say I sup-
port this amendment, which clarifies
that great bodily harm is included in
the exception to the bill’s background
check requirement, includes domestic
violence, sexual assaults, stalking, et
cetera. It is a good amendment. I urge
people to support it.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chairman, I would like to simply
close by reiterating the importance of
H.R. 8 and my support for it in this
amendment, and clarifying and pro-
tecting individuals who are at risk
from domestic violence, stalking, and
sexual assault.
Mr. Chair, I would like to thank Con-
gresswoman STEPHANIE MURPHY, who
cosponsored this amendment, as well
as Congresswoman DAVIDS and Con-
gressman NADLER for their remarks.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Oklahoma (Ms. KENDRA
S. HORN).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I demand a
recorded vote.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by
the gentlewoman from Oklahoma will
be postponed.
AMENDMENT NO. 4 OFFERED BY MR. VAN DREW
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 4 printed in
part A of House Report 116–14.
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Chairman, I
have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 3, line 3, after ‘‘children,’’ insert ‘‘in-
cluding step-parents and their step-chil-
dren’’.
Page 3, line 5, insert ‘‘, if the transferor has
no reason to believe that the transferee will
use or intends to use the firearm in a crime
or is prohibited from possessing firearms
under State or Federal law’’ before the semi-
colon.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 145, the gentleman
from New Jersey (Mr. VAN DREW) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from New Jersey.
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself as much time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chair, my amendment clarifies
that the exceptions for gifts and loans
of firearms between parents and their
children applies to stepparents and
stepchildren.
The reason I offer this amendment is
to recognize that the relationship be-
tween stepparents and stepchildren is
sometimes stronger than or as strong
as that of the biological parent-child
relationship.
The parents of one of my closest
friends are technically stepparents, but
you would never know it, because they
are all so close and love each other so
much.
The amendment also clarifies that
gifts and loans of firearms among fam-
ily members are still subject to the ex-
isting legal standard for all transfers.
Existing law states that no person
may deliver a firearm to someone if he
or she has a reason to believe that the
person is prohibited from possessing a
firearm.
Consequently, even gifts and loans
among family members are not permis-
sible if the transferor has a reason to
believe that the transferee may use the
firearm in a crime or is prohibited
from possessing firearms.
Again, the amendment clarifies that
while a background check is not re-
quired for these transfers, the existing
legal standard continues to apply.
Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair-
man, I claim the time in opposition to
the amendment, even though I am not
opposed to it.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman is recognized for 5
minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair-
man, again, I am not opposing this
amendment, but like the previous
amendment, again, it is proof that this
bill is still not ready for prime time
and should have spent more time in-
stead of moving a very ill-timed pre-
vious question because of a timing
deadline that they had to get to the
floor. It fixes one of the many flaws in
the bill.
Again, Republicans had solutions to
these loose ends all over the bill, but
our debate time was stopped. But I do
have just a question here. Although I
am not opposing this amendment, it
merely adds the exchange between
stepparent and their stepchildren.
What about stepsiblings who also
love each other dearly? But this
doesn’t include that. Stepgrandparents
and stepgrandchildren? What about fos-
ter families or adoptive families?
It is a simple fix that, again, goes
forward and, again, struggles.
But I do want to go back and address
something, Mr. Chairman, that came
up earlier, and it seemed to get an in-
teresting response from my friends
across the aisle, my colleague stated
that the appropriate fine is $1,000, not
$100,000. They cite the U.S. sentencing
guidelines for this number, but I do
have to remind the chairman that
since the Booker decision, of course,
the guidelines are only advisory. And
we need not look to the advisory guide-
lines, but look at the statute the bill
amends.
Remember, we do not vote on aspira-
tions in this Chamber; we vote on
words on paper.
18 USC 924(a)(5) contains the penalty
for violating part ‘‘(s) or (t) of section
922 shall be fined under this title, im-
prisoned for not more than 1 year, or
both.’’
18 USC 3571(b)(5) ‘‘for a Class A mis-
demeanor’’, which this is, ‘‘that does
not result in death, not more than
$100,000.’’
So it could be $1,000 or it could be up
to $100,000.
I appreciate our confusion over this
issue, but unfortunately, as I stated be-
fore, this is what happens when a bill is
rushed to the floor, and it is why we
oppose this legislation.
When we understand this, Mr. Chair-
man, again, you can offer amendments
that make Members feel good, but feel-
ing good doesn’t heal you and feeling
good will not make this better.
I will not oppose this amendment,
but, again, I think in just the moments
that I have had here, I raised enough
questions about this amendment to
VerDate Sep 11 2014 00:53 Feb 28, 2019 Jkt 089060 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K27FE7.040 H27FEPT1

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2259
February 27, 2019
take up those very issues that were
spoken of about the love between step-
parents and stepchildren. What about
the stepsiblings? What about the
stepgrandparents? That is still part of
that device and not addressed in this.
And, again, going back to the issue of
the fine: again, the statute and the bill
itself are pretty clear; it is fined under
this process and not the guidelines that
are sentencing.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself as much time as I may con-
sume.
Mr. Chair, I want to thank the body
for its support of my amendment, and
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the Van Drew
amendment.
This is a good amendment, and I be-
lieve it will be helpful, and I believe it
creates an atmosphere which is a fair
atmosphere for everyone to increase
safety and yet at the same time to un-
derstand the relationships that do exist
in stepfamilies.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I
yield myself as much time as I may
consume.
Mr. Chairman, again, I appreciate the
gentleman bringing it, but as was said,
this is an attempt to make a bill that
should have been vetted more in com-
mittee not be vetted more. And I ap-
preciate that.
I am not going to oppose the amend-
ment, but when I take it a step further,
what about the stepparents and the
stepsiblings between each other, and
the stepgrandparents and
stepgrandchildren? I have had a won-
derful look at those families. Those are
precious families. Why are we just
stopping at one?
Again, it goes back to the heart. And
I understand the rush to get here, but,
again, what makes you feel better and
makes you feel good does not always
heal you. This is something that needs
to be addressed.
Mr. Chair, with this, I am not going
to oppose this amendment. It is unfor-
tunately very lacking in a bill that is
lacking on many points, but with that,
I yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. VAN
DREW).
The amendment was agreed to.

Mr. CHABOT changed his vote from
‘‘no’’ to ‘‘aye.’’
So the amendment was agreed to.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment in the nature of a
substitute, as amended.
The amendment was agreed to.
The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule,
the Committee rises.
Accordingly, the Committee rose;
and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.
KELLY of Illinois) having assumed the
chair, Mr. PRICE of North Carolina,
Acting Chair of the Committee of the
Whole House on the state of the Union,
reported that that Committee, having
had under consideration the bill (H.R.
8) to require a background check for
every firearm sale, and, pursuant to
House Resolution 145, he reported the
bill back to the House with an amend-
ment adopted in the Committee of the
Whole.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the rule, the previous question is or-
dered.
Is a separate vote demanded on any
amendment to the amendment re-
ported from the Committee of the
Whole?
If not, the question is on the amend-
ment in the nature of a substitute, as
amended.
The amendment was agreed to.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the engrossment and
third reading of the bill.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed
and read a third time, and was read the
third time.
MOTION TO RECOMMIT
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I have a motion to recommit
at the desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the
gentleman opposed to the bill?
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I am.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve a point of order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point
of order is reserved.
The Clerk will report the motion.
The Clerk read as follows:
Mr. Collins of Georgia moves to recommit
the bill H.R. 8 to the Committee on the Judi-
ciary with instructions to report the same to
the House forthwith with the following
amendment:
Page 5, after line 4, insert the following:
‘‘(E) Regulations promulgated under this
paragraph shall include, in the case of a
background check conducted by the national
instant criminal background check system
in response to a contact from a licensed im-
porter, licensed manufacturer, or licensed
dealer, which background check indicates
that the receipt of a firearm by a person
would violate subsection (g)(5), a require-
ment that the system notify U.S. Immigra-
tion and Customs Enforcement.’’.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia is recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, this motion to recommit will
not kill the bill or send it back to com-
mittee. If adopted, the bill will imme-
diately proceed to final passage, as
amended.
As was just read, the motion to re-
commit will notify U.S. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement, commonly
known as ICE, when an illegal alien
who is prohibited from possessing a
firearm attempts to purchase a firearm
by going through the process of appli-
cation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2261
February 27, 2019
Madam Speaker, I have been here all
afternoon, and we have heard time and
time again how we have had the prob-
lem of mass violence. We have talked
about how to solve it, and, unfortu-
nately, this underlying bill, as I have
brought out many times already, will
not do this. We have heard that we
have to do something basically even if
it won’t work.
Madam Speaker, I will remind this
House one more time that what makes
you feel good does not always heal you.
When we understand that, then we can
begin to move forward.
What we have found this day is that
this bill has many problems because we
chose to rush it to the floor because we
had a deadline, and we cut off debate in
committee.
We found amendments offered to fix
parts of this bill that do not fix them
but actually make them worse.
We have found out that the authors
of the bill did not even know how much
was going to be fined in the bill until
we actually pointed it out.
Now we come to the biggest part: I
have been here all day listening to: We
have to keep criminals from having
firearms. We have to keep criminals
from having firearms.
I will say it once more, Madam
Speaker: We must keep criminals from
having firearms.
I am glad to let you know, Madam
Speaker, we are now giving everyone in
this body a chance to do just that.
A similar measure was promoted.
What we are simply saying is that, if
you have someone who is a criminal
who came into our country illegally—
criminal time number one—if they
then try to buy or purchase a firearm
which they are unable to do, that is the
second strike as a criminal, and what
we are simply saying is, if they do
that, they will be reported to ICE.
Now, which Members in this body are
opposed to notifying law enforcement
when a person prohibited from pur-
chasing a firearm attempts to do so?
Are we against that? No.
I believe my friends across the aisle
are not. I have heard it all day: We
don’t want criminals to have firearms.
But my question to you now, Madam
Speaker, is—be very careful. If you
vote ‘‘no’’ on this motion to recommit,
you cannot go back to your constitu-
ency, no matter what is said, and say:
I voted to keep illegal aliens, those
who should not have a firearm, from
having a firearm.
We have heard it all day. And you
can moan, you can talk, you can think
about it, but, again, Madam Speaker, I
understand the sympathy and the con-
cern and the pain upon this bill, but
let’s not kid ourselves. The bill itself
guts itself when it will not even allow
a registry which the Obama adminis-
tration said it had.
Let’s actually get back to a point in
saying, if there is something about this
bill, give everybody an opportunity to
actually keep a gun out of a criminal’s
hands and actually have that criminal
punished for that by turning them in.
But, Madam Speaker and my col-
leagues, please listen to me right now.
Hear me clearly. Hear me clearly. No
matter what will be said in just a mo-
ment, no matter what the chairman or
anyone else will say about this bill, if
you vote ‘‘no,’’ you are voting to allow
someone who should not have a firearm
to get away with it and not be pros-
ecuted for it.
Be very clear, Madam Speaker. You
can try and make it look better. You
can try and say: ‘‘Well, it was not part
of the bill. I have got to have the bill’’;
but never get away from the fact,
Madam Speaker, if you vote ‘‘no’’ on
this motion to recommit, you are mak-
ing a choice to say: ‘‘I guess some
criminals can get away with trying to
get a firearm.’’
That is why this motion to recommit
needs a ‘‘yes’’ vote. This is why we on
this side stand for making sure that
proper firearm safety is upheld while
our rights are being upheld and, at the
same time, looking to find real solu-
tions, not perpetrating a fraud on those
who are scared simply to pass a piece
of legislation.
Madam Speaker, vote ‘‘yes’’ on the
motion to recommit and actually keep
guns out of criminals’ hands.
Madam Speaker, I yield back balance
of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
withdraw my reservation.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
ervation of a point of order is with-
drawn.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise
in opposition to the motion to recom-
mit.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York is recognized
for 5 minutes.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, let’s
remember what we are dealing with.
We are dealing with the fact that cur-
rent Federal law with respect to fire-
arms background checks is dan-
gerously limited and flawed because
background checks are only required
for sales by licensed gun dealers and
that many, many people get a gun at a
gun show or from someone else. Some-
thing like 20 percent, I think the figure
is, or 25 percent of gun sales escape
background checks.
So all kinds of people who may be
criminals, who may be mentally ill,
and who may be domestic abusers who
shouldn’t have guns get guns, and that
results in lives forfeited. It results in
people killed.
This bill goes a long way toward solv-
ing that by saying we are going to re-
quire background checks of everyone
who gets a gun, with some exceptions,
with some reasonable exceptions which
are in the bill.
Now, along comes this motion to re-
commit, which is a total red herring
having nothing to do with the purpose
of the bill, and says that, if someone
fails a background check because he is
illegally in this country, you should re-
port that to ICE.
First of all, if he fails a background
check because he is illegally in the
country, that means the system knows
he is illegally in the country. It means
they already know that.
So what is the point of reporting
him? He has to be in the system as ille-
gally in the country in order to fail the
background check because of section
(g)(5). So we already know that, and
this is totally circular, number one.
Number two, this is just a red herring
to try to mix up the immigration issue
with the gun violence issue, and they
really have nothing to do with each
other.
Number three, for 8 years, we
couldn’t get a hearing—not a hearing
in a committee—on this bill or on any
real bill to stop the plague of handgun
violence in this country.
Madam Speaker, 150 people killed in
Great Britain, 95 in Austria or wher-
ever, 39,000 in the United States—no
one will tell me that Americans are
10,000 times as mentally ill as Euro-
peans or Japanese. The problem is we
don’t have adequate protections on
guns. This bill goes in the direction of
doing it, and they want to sabotage the
bill with a phony issue raised by this
MTR.
Now, there is an issue. If people fail
the background check for various rea-
sons, then you can make a case it
should be reported to local law enforce-
ment agencies. Mr. CICILLINE has a bill
to do just that. I am going to yield to
him in a second. But the fact is it has
nothing to do with this bill. It is just
an attempt to sabotage this bill.
If you believe that we ought to cut
down on the plague of gun violence in
this country, that we ought to save
lives, that we ought to get rid of all
these people who shouldn’t have guns
having guns, and that we ought to have
background checks in sensible situa-
tions, then vote against the motion to
recommit and for the bill.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island (Mr.
CICILLINE).
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
We are on the precipice of passing the
first commonsense gun safety bill in
this Congress in 25 years. I have been
here for 8 years. We begged and pleaded
and had a sit-in to try to force Repub-
licans to take up some measure to re-
duce gun violence in this country.
There are women, men, and families
all across America who are demanding
that Congress do something. We are
about to do this, and you raise a mo-
tion to recommit on a phony issue to
try to muck this up with this gimmick.
If you were concerned about reducing
gun violence in this country and pass-
ing commonsense gun safety legisla-
tion, you had 8 years to bring a bill to
the floor.
But if you are really concerned about
this, I have good news for you. I have
legislation, because, in fact, if someone
buys a gun who is a prohibited pur-
chaser, whatever their immigration
status is, if they have committed a
crime, then they should be arrested

and prosecuted. Every single Democrat
believes that.
So I have a piece of legislation that
says, if that happens, notify the field
office of the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation, the local law enforcement
agency, and the State law enforcement
agency, the agencies responsible for en-
forcing the criminal law, so they can
arrest and prosecute that person.
I am looking for a Republican colead.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Madam Speaker, defeat this phony
amendment and pass universal back-
ground checks.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, let us
not accept this red herring. Let us not
divert. Vote ‘‘no’’ on the motion to re-
commit and ‘‘yes’’ on the bill.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit.
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion to recommit.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the noes appeared to have it.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas
and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair
will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum
time for any electronic vote on the
question of passage of the bill.
This is a 5-minute vote.
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 220, nays

Mr. HOYER. The vote now is to pass

feated if the bill is defeated?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Fol-
lowing the disposition of the amend-
ment, the Chair will put the question
on passage of the bill.
The question is on the amendment.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER
PRO TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair will remind all persons in the
gallery that they are here as guests of
the House and that any manifestation
of approval or disapproval of pro-
ceedings is in violation of the rules of
the House.
REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER
AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 787
Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that
my name be removed as a cosponsor of
H.R. 787.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Florida?
There was no objection.
f
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 962,
BORN-ALIVE ABORTION SUR-
VIVORS PROTECTION ACT
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that
the Committee on the Judiciary be dis-
charged from further consideration of a
bill I sponsored, H.R. 962, the Born-
Alive Abortion Survivors Protection
Act, to make sure that the most vul-
nerable children in the United States
have access to lifesaving medical care,
and ask for its immediate consider-
ation in the House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the guidelines consistently issued by
successive Speakers as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been
cleared by the bipartisan floor and
committee leaderships.
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam
Speaker, if this unanimous consent re-
quest cannot be entertained, I urge the
Speaker and the Majority Leader to
immediately schedule a vote on the
Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protec-
tion Act so that we can protect the
sanctity of human life.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is not recognized for debate.
f
HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that when the
House adjourns today, it adjourn to
meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

tleman from New Jersey?
There was no objection.

RECOGNIZING HEALTH AND
WELLNESS COACHES
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor America’s health and
wellness coaches.
Approximately 70 percent of
healthcare dollars in the United States
are spent on lifestyle-related diseases;
but health and wellness coaches can de-
crease those costs by helping people
achieve their personal health and
wellness goals.
Far too many people suffer and
struggle with poor health because they
don’t have the motivation and re-
sources or sustained support needed in

order to transform their habits.
Healthy habits are not always easily
achievable when a patient is working
alone, but health coaches are there to
ensure people succeed in taking control
of their health issues.
That is why, earlier in February,
Congressman MULLIN and I introduced
a bipartisan resolution to express our
support for health and wellness coach-
es. I am proud of our work together as
co-chairs of the Congressional Men’s
Health Caucus, and I encourage my col-
leagues to join us in recognizing Amer-
ica’s health and wellness coaches.
f
METHANE RELIEF ACT
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, in 2016, the Environ-
mental Protection Agency announced
the New Source Performance Stand-
ards for the oil and natural gas indus-
try to further regulate methane emis-
sions. Thankfully, the EPA is revis-
iting this regulation in an effort to
provide flexibility and relief moving
forward.
For many small oil and gas pro-
ducers, these requirements contained
in the original regulation are simply
unworkable and overly burdensome.
For example, the regulation would
even apply to wells that produce less
than 15 barrels of oil and less than
90,000 cubic feet of natural gas per day.
Because these wells produce at low vol-
umes, the profit margin remains tight
for the operators.
However, under the original rule,
these low-volume producers would be
subject to expensive upgrades, addi-
tional reporting requirements and ad-
ministrative costs in order to comply
with the regulation.
Madam Speaker, today I introduced
H.R. 1391, the Methane Relief Act of
2019, which would exempt these low-
volume wells from the rule’s require-
ments. Doing so will allow for com-
monsense regulatory relief and cer-
tainty for these smaller operators
which account for an important part of
our domestic energy industry.
f
AN ACTUAL NATIONAL
EMERGENCY
(Ms. WILSON of Florida asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to address an ac-
tual national emergency. There are too
many damn guns in America, and far
too many lives have been lost. Last
year alone 40,000 Americans were fa-
tally shot, the most in 50 years.
My county suffers from gun violence
on a near-daily basis. In the last 5
years, we have lost 370 people to gun
violence; 127 of these victims were chil-
dren.
Recently, a pregnant mother was
killed, and her teenage daughter in-
jured in a senseless shooting. The fam-
ily had already lost a relative to gun
violence.
Almost as shocking as these statis-
tics, for 25 years Congress failed to pass
significant gun control legislation
until today. I am comforted by how
swiftly House Democrats began tack-
ling this crisis, and pray that the Sen-
ate finds the courage to follow our
lead.
American voters sent us an urgent
message last November; thoughts and
prayers and moments of silence are not
enough. Let us reassure them that
passing the Background Checks Act of
2019 is just the first step of many more
to come; and we won’t stop until this
national emergency is over.
f
THE TEXAS SKY HAS A NEW STAR
(Mr. OLSON asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, we all
know an iconic Texas song: ‘‘The stars
at night are big and bright, deep in the
heart of Texas.’’
The sky of Texas has a new star, the
brightest star ever. Her name is Marlee
Hope Pack. She is glowing right beside
me.
After a courageous fight with child-
hood cancer, God called Marlee home
on February 23. Marlee’s cancer would
not be stopped. Her dad, Bill, kept ask-
ing Marlee: What is your wish with
Make-A-Wish?
After a few weeks, sweet Marlee an-
swered: ‘‘Dad, if I have to think about
it this hard, I don’t need a wish.’’
Marlee turned Make-A-Wish into
make a gift. She opened Marlee’s Bear
Workshop and partnered with Build-A-
Bear to give kids with cancer teddy
bears and hope.
Thank you, Bill and Shelly, and all
who loved Marlee for giving us such a
special person. She made our world bet-
ter.

175TH ANNIVERSARY OF DOMINI-
CAN INDEPENDENCE FROM HAITI
(Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor the 175th anniver-
sary of Dominican independence and
the birth of the first country I call
home.
On February 27, 1844, the founding fa-
thers of the Dominican Republican,
great statesmen and lovers of freedom
and democracy, raised the flag of a new
republic in Santo Domingo and pro-
claimed their independence from Haiti,
bringing another democratic republic
into the family of nations.
In the words of Dominican icon and
independence leader Juan Pablo
Duarte: ‘‘Love of country led us to
make sacred commitments with the
next generation,’’ and the commit-
ments that he and his fellow patriots
made 175 years ago live on in the
hearts of every Quisqueyano, whether
they are still on the island of their
birth or whether they have made a new
home abroad.
Today is the day for all of us to cele-
brate the contributions of the Domini-
can people, just as my compatriots cel-
ebrate their independence throughout
the country.
f
RECOGNIZING JALISA PETERSON
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms.
Jalisa Peterson from Liberty County
High School on being a finalist for the
2019 Prudential Spirit of Community
Awards.
One of 29,000 students across the
country who participated, Ms. Peterson
was one of only eight high school stu-
dents acknowledged in the State of
Georgia for exceptional projects of
community service. Specifically, she
volunteered at a local orphanage, play-
ing games, crafting art, reading, and
building relationships with children,
all the way from newborns to 18-year-
olds.
I am very proud of Ms. Peterson’s
work and glad to have someone like
her in the First Congressional District
of Georgia.
I am glad to see this award is encour-
aging more community service, a cru-
cial aspect in order to make our world
a better place to live.
f
GUN VIOLENCE: WE NEED TO DO
MORE
(Mr. CASTEN of Illinois asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, we just voted on H.R. 8. It is
the first gun control measure we have
taken up in years. It is progress, but we
still have so far to go. There are so
many lives that have been taken from
too many communities.
On February 15 in Aurora, Illinois, on
the edge of my district, that was the
community where a man with a gun
took five innocent lives: Trevor
Wehner, Clayton Parks, Vicente
Juarez, Russell Beyer, and Josh
Pinkard.
They were fathers, brothers, sons, un-
cles, friends, and they joined a long
line of Americans who have been going
about their daily lives and got killed.
Here is what is really sickening:
Most of the Members of this body don’t
even know their names. A week from
now, you are going to forget their
names, and you are going to replace
them with another set of names, not
because they don’t deserve to be re-
membered, but because every day in
America, 100 people get shot.

Can we remember all their names? I
can’t. And shame on us for allowing
that to happen.
Occasionally, one of those shootings
captures our attention, and we offer
some thoughts and prayers. Leave that
to families. Leave that to people of
faith. We are lawmakers. Our job is to
write the laws, fix the laws.
If we took 100 million guns off the
street tomorrow, we would still have
more guns than any other country. We
need to do more.
f
GREATER BRANDON CHAMBER OF
COMMERCE
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to call attention to the Greater
Brandon Chamber of Commerce, an in-
stitution that has helped small busi-
nesses and business owners in the
Tampa Bay area succeed for over 60
years.
I think specifically of Ron Pierce, a
very good friend of mine who started
his own consulting firm 10 years ago.
Over the past decade, he has grown his
small business to include four other
consultants and now provides advice to
some of the largest interests in Tampa,
including the Tampa Bay Lightning
and the Port of Tampa Bay.
On top of managing his own success-
ful business, he is also an upstanding
member of our community. He regu-
larly volunteers to bring food and
clothing to families in need. He has
worked on youth drowning prevention
and provided advice to leaders in
Tampa Bay on how to improve our
local economy.
In recognition of his service, the
Chamber recently bestowed upon him
the Community Leadership Award, the
highest honor granted by the organiza-
tion.
The Greater Brandon Chamber of
Commerce is a model organization in
my district, and it helps small busi-
nesses succeed in their work so that
they can then help others.
I am proud to be a member of the
Brandon Chamber of Commerce. As a
member of the Small Business Com-
mittee, I look forward to working with
them to create a stronger economy for
Tampa Bay.
f
GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION
(Mr. SUOZZI asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I just
voted for H.R. 8, and I stand in support
of H.R. 1112.
It has been 1 year since Parkland. It
has been 6 years since Sandy Hook. It
has been 19 years since Columbine. It
has been 25 years since the Long Island
Rail Road massacre, when Congress-
woman Carolyn McCarthy lost her hus-
band and her son was shot in the head.
It has been 37 years since President
Reagan was shot.
Think of all the suffering that each
of these shootings has caused. Think of
the missing seats at the dinner table
and other family events.
Countless families have been torn
apart because of gun violence, includ-
ing that of one of my constituents,
Linda Beigel Schulman.
Linda’s son, Scott, was one of the 17
innocent people who lost their lives in
Parkland that day last year. Scott, a
geography teacher and a cross-country
coach, gave his life protecting his stu-
dents. Scott died heroically while lock-
ing the door to his classroom, where
students were hiding from the ap-
proaching gunman.
Since that date, we have been push-
ing more and more for commonsense
gun reform, and H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112
are just that.
Last week, Linda said to me, ‘‘If a
universal background check prevents
just one shooting, it has served its pur-
pose.’’
She inspires me. And I am inspired
by my colleagues who are fighting for
commonsense gun reform, whether
they be Democrats or Republicans.
f
EUREKA BASKETBALL
(Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise
to congratulate the Eureka College
men’s basketball team, which last
weekend clinched their first ever Divi-
sion III NCAA tournament bid.
On Saturday night, the Red Devils
knocked off top-seeded Webster 70–69
on the road to secure their conference
championship, assuring their spot in
the Division III tournament.
With just a few weeks remaining in
the regular season, the Red Devils
needed to win out their remaining four
games to enter the conference tour-
nament, and they did just that.
The never-give-up spirit embodied by
the team is a testament to the great
work done by Coach Chip Wilde, and I
have no doubt it will carry them
through the NCAA tournament.
Our community in central Illinois is
immensely proud of the historic ac-
complishments of this year’s Eureka
men’s basketball team, and we will be
cheering them on as they take on the
number-one-seeded Nebraska Wesleyan
this weekend.
Congratulations, and go Red Devils.
f
RECOGNIZING MAMA LILA CABBIL
(Mr. LEVIN of Michigan asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam
Speaker, as we recognize Black History
Month, I rise to celebrate the life and
contributions of a remarkable Detroit
community activist.
While I was at the Macomb County
Celebration of Black Excellence last
Saturday, the Michigan activist com-
munity received news of the loss of
Mama Lila Cabbil.
A close friend of Rosa Parks for 30
years, Ms. Cabbil was a national leader
in the fight against racism and a pow-
erful Detroit activist, particularly in
the struggle for clean and accessible
water.
At Rosa Parks’ funeral service in
2005, Ms. Cabbil invoked Matthew 7:16:
‘‘You shall know them by their fruits.’’
When I read those words today, I think
of Mama Lila’s commitment to Michi-
gan’s Black community and to all com-
munities that have suffered the theft of
their voting rights and the unjust loss
of their homes and their water.
During Black History Month, it is
my honor to highlight Mama Lila’s
contribution to Detroit and our region
and the example she sets for all of us as
a passionate servant leader.
f
RECOGNIZING JOHN WILLIAM
TYSON
(Mr. WOMACK asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the life and legacy
of Arkansas businessman and Tyson
Foods founder, the late John William
Tyson.
John spent his life building Tyson
Foods into one of the world’s leading
food companies and was equally com-
mitted to serving northwest Arkansas.
In 1931, John Tyson moved his family
to Springdale with only a nickel in his
pocket. There, he laid the foundation
for a future Fortune 100 company.
John transformed the poultry indus-
try. He developed a novel in-transit
feeding system, hatched chickens, and
produced commercial feed himself.
With each new venture, John diversi-
fied and grew his business.
In 1947, Tyson Feed and Hatchery was
incorporated. Over time, the business
expanded to become the successful
company that we know today.
He exemplified the entrepreneurial
spirit of our State, and it is for his con-
tributions to the Arkansas economy
that he is being posthumously en-
shrined in the Arkansas Business Hall
of Fame.
I congratulate his family for this ter-
rific honor.

act right in front of my house in Little
Village in Chicago. As of Sunday, our
city had witnessed 241 shootings in 2019
so far, including two in my neighbor-
hood in the last week.
In fact, in Chicago, five of six homi-
cides remain unsolved, but Chicago has
some of the most stringent gun laws in
the U.S. What we need is Federal legis-
lation that makes it harder to access
guns.
It is our responsibility to stand up
for the safety of our communities we
serve. I am proud to have voted for the
passage of the Bipartisan Background
Checks Act moments ago. Tomorrow,
we will vote to close the Charleston
loophole, and I urge my Senate col-
leagues to advance these efforts imme-
diately.
f
REQUIRE NICS TO REPORT TO ICE
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I was
disappointed in the passage of H.R. 8
just a few moments ago, which will do
nothing to address the rash of mass
shootings that have occurred across
this country in recent years but will
place impediments in the way of law-
abiding citizens acquiring firearms and
in defense of their Second Amendment
rights. But I was pleased that the mo-
tion to recommit was adopted.
That motion was based on an amend-
ment I offered in committee to require
the national instant background sys-
tem to report to ICE when an illegal
immigrant tries to obtain a firearm in
violation of current law. I was pleased
that it received 220 votes.
I have drafted it as a standalone bill.
I will offer it for cosponsorship. I hope
my colleagues will join me in cospon-
soring the bill and ensuring those not
here legally who try to purchase a gun
are reported to ICE and deported before
they commit additional crimes.

YOUTH ACTIVISM AGAINST GUN
VIOLENCE
(Mrs. MURPHY asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mrs. MURPHY. Madam Speaker,
Newtown, Charleston, San Bernardino,
my hometown of Orlando, Vegas, Park-
land: Young Americans have grown up
associating these cities with pain and
tragedy. They have only known a Con-
gress that is unwilling to address gun
violence or be moved even by the
senseless murder of innocent children.
After car accidents, gun violence is
now the second leading cause of death
among young people. This is a stag-
gering statistic, and my young con-
stituents know it. They live in fear
that their classmates, friends, family
members, or neighbors could be the
next target. But instead of sitting on
the sidelines, young Americans have
marched, mobilized, and found purpose.
Today, their collective voices rever-
berated across the Halls of Congress as
the House, for the first time in decades,
answers their calls for commonsense
gun safety measures.
I am proud to support legislation
that will strengthen our background
check system to help keep dangerous
weapons away from dangerous people.
By passing these commonsense meas-
ures, we are finally taking concrete
steps to defend the lives of these young
Americans and guarantee them a safer
future.
As chair of the Future Forum, I
thank every young leader who has
helped us get to this historic moment.
We hear your pleas. We value your ac-
tivism. And we will keep fighting with
you to end gun violence once and for
all.

NO MORE
(Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute.)
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts.
Madam Speaker, after the Parkland
shooting, high school students in my
district told me a heartbreaking truth.
They didn’t believe that Congress cared
about their lives or their future. Sadly,
I understood why.
Complacency defined the Republican
Congress’ position on gun violence.
They did nothing after moviegoers
were slaughtered in Aurora, kinder-
gartners were murdered in Newtown,
and after one of our own colleagues,
Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, was
shot doing her job as a U.S. Represent-
ative.
After 46 people were gunned down at
the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, I sat on
this very floor in protest. My col-
leagues and I sat in solidarity with a
very clear but somber message: No
more. No more moments of silence. No
more inaction while Americans had
senseless deaths due to gun violence.
No more would the entirety of solu-
tions to gun violence be tweets with
our thoughts and prayers.
It has been 2 years since the sit-in
and, finally, the inaction has come to
an end. Thanks to the brave survivors,
the students, the advocates, and the
family members, we have been able to
pass commonsense gun safety.
Today is a new day, and we will con-
tinue this fight.

HONORING THE 110TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE NATIONAL ASSO-
CIATION FOR THE ADVANCE-
MENT OF COLORED PEOPLE AND
RECOGNIZING BLACK HISTORY
MONTH
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
WILD). Under the Speaker’s announced
policy of January 3, 2019, the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN) is rec-
ognized for 60 minutes as the designee
of the majority leader.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the majority leader and all
of those persons in leadership who
make it possible for us to have these
opportunities.
I am especially proud to be here to-
night because we have two resolutions
that will be presented. These two reso-
lutions have been presented before. One
is H. Res. 154. This resolution is one
that honors and praises the NAACP,
the National Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored People. The sec-
ond is H. Res. 155. It is a Black history
resolution.
It is interesting to note that the
NAACP was founded during Black His-
tory Month. The NAACP was founded
February 12, 1909. The NAACP has a
proud history, and I will say more
about it in just a moment.
Next, I would like to talk for a brief
moment about the resolution that we
have for Black History Month.
Black History Month didn’t start out
as Black History Month. The Honor-
able Carter G. Woodson initiated what
was called Negro History Week. Negro
History Week was a time for us to ac-
knowledge the accomplishments of Af-
rican Americans, at that time called
Negroes. We have metamorphosed
through many titles, many names,
from Negroes to African Americans.
Black History Month was something
that Mr. Woodson found to come into
being in 1976. This was done by Presi-
dent Joe Ford. As it has been des-
ignated as Black History Month, we
have celebrated it as such across the
length and breadth of this Nation.
Carter G. Woodson was a person with
great vision. He obviously knew that in
1926, when this was initially brought to
the attention of the public, there was
not a good likelihood that you would
be able to have a Black History Month.
But he knew that, if you can start
someplace, you might finish in a great-
er place. So he started in 1926 with
Black History Week, and it has meta-
morphosed into a month.
You and I know that every day is a
day that we should celebrate all his-
tory, and Black history is no excep-
tion. I am not a person who believes
that we should have Black History
Month forever. I think that Black his-
tory, properly incorporated and cele-
brated within American history and
world history, would be more than
enough. But today, we are honored to
celebrate Black History Month and the
NAACP as an organization that was
founded during Black History Month.
I would like to say just a few words
about this NAACP resolution in terms
of the first time we brought it to the
floor of the Congress of the United
States of America.
When we brought it to the floor the
very first time, the cosponsor of the
resolution was Mr. Henry Hyde, and
the person who controlled the time was
Mr. JIM SENSENBRENNER. Mr. SENSEN-
BRENNER, at that time, was the chair-
person of the Judiciary Committee. I
recall Mr. SENSENBRENNER standing

over to my right and making his com-
mentary about the NAACP. He spoke
with a degree of fervor that I thought
was needed at the time.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER, while he
brought it to the floor and did direct
the traffic, I would note that it was not
an easy resolution to get past the
House of Representatives. It did pass
with consent of the House. It was
agreed to, if you will.
Mr. SENSENBRENNER and Mr. Hyde
had a difficult time getting it through
the House. I am proud that they did,
and I am pleased that none of the Mem-
bers at that time voiced objections to
the resolution being agreed to. Mr.
SENSENBRENNER I will always remem-
ber as a person who was a champion for
this resolution, and Mr. Hyde was the
cosponsor of the NAACP resolution.
The NAACP is celebrating its 110th
anniversary. This is probably the Na-
tion’s oldest and best known civil
rights organization, founded on Feb-
ruary 12 of 1909, the date of the centen-
nial of Abraham Lincoln’s birth, the
centennial of his birth.
It is interesting to note that Black
History Month was considered because
of Abraham Lincoln’s birth as well, so
the two resolutions have this in com-
mon, Black History Month and the
NAACP’s being celebrated and recog-
nized today.
It was founded by a diverse group of
persons who were outstanding citizens.
I would also add that it was not found-
ed by a group of persons all of whom
were African American. I will call off
the names for you to give you some in-
dication.
Ida Wells-Barnett, the well-known
W.E.B. Du Bois, Henry Moscowitz,
Mary White Ovington, Oswald Garrison
Villard, and William English Walling—
all persons who were founders of the
NAACP.
The NAACP, for the early part of its
history, had a minority of minorities,
meaning African Americans were not
the dominant force within its leader-
ship. They had persons who were car-
rying the torch of freedom such that
African Americans could be a part of
it. But it is interesting to note that,
early on, the leadership was predomi-
nantly Anglo persons.
The NAACP, as indicated, is the old-
est, largest, and most widely recog-
nized grassroots-based civil rights or-
ganization in the United States. The
active membership is in all 50 States,
including State conferences of
branches and local branches, as well as
branches in prisons and chapters on
college campuses and high schools
throughout the Nation.
The NAACP has its national head-
quarters in Baltimore, Maryland.
The NAACP is here to ensure the po-
litical, educational, social, and eco-
nomic rights of all persons and to
eliminate racial hatred and racial dis-
crimination.
The NAACP is committed to achiev-
ing its goals through nonviolence, in-
cluding negotiation, litigation, and
protestation.
The NAACP is well known for its liti-
gation. The Honorable Thurgood Mar-
shall, an African American to become
Supreme Court Justice, was the chief
litigator for the NAACP. Under his
leadership, with the assistance of a
good many other people, the NAACP
was able to win many lawsuits before
the Supreme Court. The lawsuit Brown
v. Board of Education is one of the
most notable lawsuits that the NAACP
championed.
The NAACP has used political pres-
sure, marches, demonstrations, and ef-
fective lobbying to secure the voice for
those who are considered voiceless in
the United States of America.
The NAACP has been fighting seg-
regation in public schools under the
leadership of Thurgood Marshall, as I
indicated earlier, and its greatest vic-
tories, of course, include, as I indi-
cated, Brown v. Board of Education.
The NAACP, in 2005, launched the
Disaster Relief Fund to help hurricane
survivors in Louisiana, Mississippi,
Texas, Florida, and Alabama to rebuild
their lives.
So the organization has metamor-
phosed into one that does more than
champion the causes of civil rights as
they relate to persons being discrimi-
nated against. It also champions the
causes of those who are among the
least, the last, and the lost in our soci-
ety: persons who have been locked out,
persons who have been left behind, per-
sons who but for the NAACP might not
have a voice.
I was very honored to be a part of the
NAACP’s disaster relief help. I am also
honored to have been a branch presi-
dent of the NAACP in Houston, Texas.
The NAACP was instrumental in the
enactment of the Matthew Shepard and
James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Preven-
tion Act, which generally and greatly
expanded the legal definition of a hate
crime. This was an important piece of
legislation. I was honored to be here at
the time we took up the legislation.
Hate crimes are still crimes that we
have to not only acknowledge exist,
but the law ought to have con-
sequences for persons who commit
these dastardly deeds.
Throughout its existence, the
NAACP has led the charge to defend
the constitutional right to vote. That
is an important piece of commentary,
the right to vote. The NAACP is still a
part of the effort to assure every per-
son the right to vote in this country.
The NAACP has taken on the chal-
lenge of dealing with the photo IDs
that are required in an insidious way.
It has also taken on the challenge of
making sure that persons are properly
registered so that they can vote, and
also making sure that those who would
thwart the efforts to register persons
to vote are not successful in doing so.
The NAACP has led the effort to
strengthen the Voting Rights Act and
to protect the principle of one person,
one vote. The NAACP led the charge in
raising awareness about and chal-
lenging voter suppression laws in Fed-
eral courts across the Nation.
The NAACP board of directors unani-
mously elected Derrick Johnson as its
President and CEO, who is doing an
outstanding job. I am proud to be asso-
ciated with him and the endeavors.
I am a proud member of the NAACP.
I have been such for a good deal of my
life. I am honored to have a life mem-
bership, to have a golden heritage
membership, and to have a diamond
membership.
I believe those of us who have bene-
fited from the NAACP ought to be
members of the organization that has
made it possible for us to have many of
the opportunities that we have. I al-
ways acknowledge my membership in
the organization, and I encourage oth-
ers to do so who happen to be members
as well: the NAACP, a proud organiza-
tion that we celebrate during this
Black History Month.
The Black history resolution covers
more than the NAACP. It talks about
Black migrations. It emphasizes the
movement of people of African descent
to new destinations and new social re-
alities. This focuses on, primarily, the
migration of African Americans in this
country. It focuses specifically on the
20th century through today.
It deals with patterns of movement,
including the relocation of persons of
African ancestry from Southern farms
to Southern cities; from the South to
the Northeast, Midwest, and West; and
from the Caribbean to the United
States. Black people have been in mo-
tion in the 20th century and up to this
date, and this resolution acknowledges
this.
b 1630
It also talks about the interactions
with law enforcement that often result
in some ugly circumstances, imprison-
ment and convict leasing.
Convict leasing is something that we
should give a little bit more emphasis
to.
In the State of Texas, we recently
discovered a grave site containing 95
bodies. These 95 bodies were of persons
who were victims of the State’s law
that allowed convict leasing.
Many times persons were charged
with minor offenses and while they
were incarcerated, they could be leased
to private parties for the purpose of
having them work as convicts. And
many times—too often, I might add—
the persons who were leased out, were
not treated properly. In fact, they were
treated poorly.
Many times they were not given
proper food, proper clothing, and prop-
er shelter; and as a result, many of
them died at an early age. In this grave
of 95 persons, there are persons who
were thought to have been teenagers at
the time of that death.
We are not absolutely sure they were
all African Americans, but the sus-
picion is that a good many of them
were. Some of them were likely to have
been Anglos as well.
After finding their bodies in Sugar
Land, Texas, on the site of a school,

school property, the bodies were ex-
humed, and they were to be relocated
to another place. And in so doing, a
good many of the citizens, the activist
community, decided that this was an
inappropriate thing to do—the bodies
being exhumed and reinterred at an-
other location.
There was a serious meeting before
the school board. And the school board
and the county commissioners, the
commissioners court decided that it
would be appropriate to further study
the possibility of inhuming these bod-
ies in the place where they were ex-
humed.
And my hope is we would follow
through on this and give them not only
a burial site with a proper plaque to
memorialize their being in this place,
but also to do a little bit more and
have some sort of structure or facility
that would allow persons to acquire in-
telligence about what actually hap-
pened to these people, how they lived,
and how they died, and why.
This country has come a long way,
but, of course, we still have much more
to do. But we want to make sure that
we do not overlook the history associ-
ated with persons who were leased as
convicts to private persons for the pur-
pose of performing work for them.
This migration that I spoke of ear-
lier, known as the Great Migration,
was caused by a lack of economic op-
portunities because of harsh segrega-
tion laws in the south and because of
the terror that was perpetrated against
African American communities by the
KKK.
The KKK, obviously, was active in
the south; and the KKK, obviously, was
in the business of terrorizing African
American persons. And it is interesting
to note that while this House has con-
demned a good many persons for their
activities, I have not been able to find
a record showing that the KKK has
been condemned for its activities by
way of a resolution that actually fo-
cuses on a person who has been associ-
ated with that organization.
The KKK has a horrible history in
this country, and it is my hope that we
in the House of Representatives will
take up a resolution condemning this
entity for what it has done.
I plan to bring such a resolution to
the attention of the House.
This resolution on black history indi-
cates that prior to 1910; more than 90
percent of African Americans lived in
the south. And by the 1970s, 47 percent
of all African Americans were living in
the north and in the west.
This is why it is called the Great Mi-
gration. When you have this much of a
population moving for opportunities,
moving for reasons associated with
concern for their well-being, that is a
significant migration.
And during World War I, when slow-
ing immigration from Europe created a
labor shortage in the north, companies
began recruiting African Americans to
fill the assembly lines, to work in steel
mills and railroads and factories. It
was not unusual to hear persons talk
about ‘‘going up north,’’ going up north
so that they could have opportunities
in the north that they were unable to
acquire in the south.
African Americans who migrated to
the north still faced racial discrimina-
tion in the form of redlining, in the
form of racially based housing ordi-
nances, in the form of higher rent
based on race, and for the resurgence of
the KKK, and the rising instances of
race riots.
African Americans were not always
welcomed with open arms when they
sought to migrate to these new des-
tinations.
African Americans created their own
cities and neighborhoods, free of dis-
crimination, where their culture ex-
panded.
For example, in Harlem, New York
City, that housed over 200,000 African
Americans, there was a culture that
was created there in Harlem. And we
are proud to say that that culture still
exists. Harlem has been a very impor-
tant part of African American history.
Efforts were made to provide edu-
cational opportunities for African
Americans, including the founding of
what is now North Carolina Central
University.
Greenwood, Oklahoma, is another
part of the history that we ought to ac-
knowledge. It was a part of Tulsa, and
became the home of a thriving black
business—a section also known as
Black Wall Street—until the Tulsa riot
of 1921, in which a white mob literally
burned down Greenwood.
U.S. history has some parts of it that
we are not proud of, but we do have to
acknowledge.
In Houston, Texas, there is an area
known as Freedmen’s Town. And freed
slaves were given the opportunity to
purchase land and build their homes
along the bayou, known as Buffalo
Bayou in Houston, Texas. And this was
at the end of the Civil War.
And over six decades, the town
thrived with churches and schools and
stores and theaters and jazz spots—
clubs, if you will. This was a thriving
area dominated by African Americans.
I would also like to mention another
personality;
Judge Frank M. Johnson, who was
said to be one of the most courageous
judges ever to occupy a Federal bench;
he was a part of the effort to integrate
the south. There are many people who
have praised him, including Dr. Martin
Luther King.
He is the person who issued the order
to require the constabulary to allow
the marches to proceed across the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge as they marched
from Selma to Montgomery.
He is the person who filed the order—
along with the other judges—to inte-
grate the bus line, that was called the
Montgomery bus boycott. He opened
the doors to persons of all hues, espe-
cially those of African ancestry who
had been locked out.
Frank M. Johnson will ever be re-
membered as a champion of human
rights. In fact, he will also be remem-
bered as a person who did it under ad-
verse circumstances, because he had to
have, for many years, 24-hour security.
His mother’s home was torched at one
time.
It was not easy to be on the side of
African Americans in the early part of
history.
Frank M. Johnson took such a stand.
We would also recognize Senator Ed-
ward Brooke, III, who became the first
African American popularly elected to
the United States Senate.
He was from Massachusetts, and he
served there for many years. He was
the first attorney general of African
ancestry in any state.
In 1962, he cowrote the Civil Rights
Act of 1968, which prohibited discrimi-
nation in housing. He was the first Re-
publican to call for President Nixon’s
resignation in light of the Watergate
scandal.
The history of African Americans in
the north is one that is rich; the his-
tory in the south is one that is rich;
but they all started, to a greater ex-
tent, with a migration that proceeded
from the south to many destinations in
the north, as well as in the west.
So today, we have a resolution that
encourages the continued spread of
knowledge regarding black history, and
that it not be limited to one month,
but that we do this throughout the en-
tire year.
I am so honored that my colleagues
have signed on to this resolution. We
have had more than 60 colleagues to
sign on to one, and I would hope that
as we continue to present these resolu-
tions, we will have more persons who
will find favor with them.
In closing, simply this: The success
that we have had as African Ameri-
cans—if we look closely at our his-
tory—we will find that it was not
something that was acquired by our
own efforts alone.
Of course, we have done our part to
extricate ourselves from some cir-
cumstances that were indeed unpleas-
ant and very harmful and hurtful, but
there were other persons who were
there to be of assistance and help.
Many of the stations at the Under-
ground Railroad had persons who were
not of African ancestry that were there
for us as we were traversing our way to
freedom.
In many of the battles that were
fought in the courtrooms, there were
persons who were funding the litiga-
tion that were not of African ancestry.
The Spingarn brothers are such per-
sons. The NAACP awards its highest
medal annually in the name of the
Spingarns.
When we have had few people to
stand with us, the Jewish community
has been there. When we have had few
people to stand with us, the LGBTQ
community has been there. When we
have had few to stand with us, we have
had persons of all stripes; Muslims
have been there; persons of all faiths
have been there.

Vol. 165 WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 2019 No. 36
Senate
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was
called to order by the President pro
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).
f
PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
Precious Lord, take our hands. Lead
us forward, and help us to stand.
We praise You for the gifts and tal-
ents You have given our Senators. Con-
tinue to bless them with influence that
can make a difference. Lord, give them
the wisdom to cut through the complex
issues and discover solutions to the
challenging problems that threaten our
freedom. Remind them to be good stew-
ards of the abilities You have so gener-
ously given them. Prepare their hearts
to respond to You with gratitude as
they strive to live for Your glory.
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

leadership time is reserved.

CONCLUSION OF MORNING

business is closed.

EXECUTIVE SESSION
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read the nomination of Michael J.
Desmond, of California, to be Chief
Counsel for the Internal Revenue Serv-
ice and an Assistant General Counsel
in the Department of the Treasury.
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday, the Senate confirmed the 31st
new circuit judge since January of 2017.
Eric Miller came to the Senate for our
consideration with a stellar resume
and a sterling legal reputation. We had
every indication he would interpret our
Nation’s laws and Constitution as they
are actually written. This is exactly
the kind of judge the American people
deserve to sit on our Nation’s courts of
appeals. That is why the Senate will
continue to make judicial nominations
a top priority.
This week, however, we need to make
more progress on the backlog of impor-
tant executive branch nominees whom
Democrats’ delaying tactics and ob-
struction have left literally lan-
guishing on the Senate calendar.
The first is Michael Desmond, the
President’s choice to serve as Chief
Counsel of the IRS. Mr. Desmond has
put his legal expertise to work through
years of public service, including at the
Department of Justice Tax Division
and at the Department of the Treasury.
He has an impressive private sector
background as well.
So listen to this: In the last Con-
gress, the Finance Committee rec-
ommended Mr. Desmond to the full
Senate by a vote of 25 to 2. That was
last August. Yet this noncontroversial
nominee never got a floor vote and had
to be sent back to the White House.
Well, Mr. Desmond was renominated.
Earlier this month, our colleagues on
the Finance Committee reported him
favorably yet again—26 to 2.
I am sorry my Democratic colleagues
required us to file cloture on this thor-
oughly noncontroversial nominee. It is
a good example of the unreasonable
tactics that have, sadly, become their
standing operating procedure in many
cases, but I am glad we voted to ad-
vance the nomination yesterday, and I
urge everyone to join me in voting to
confirm him soon.
THE GREEN NEW DEAL
Mr. President, on another matter,
the Environment and Public Works
Committee, led by Chairman BAR-
RASSO, is meeting today to consider
legislation that would help reduce, cap-
ture, and find productive uses for car-
bon dioxide emissions. It is an impor-
tant subject and deserves a serious ap-
proach, but, as we all know, some on
the far left have recently offered other
ideas on this subject. That is right—
the much heralded Green New Deal.
Nothing says forward-thinking and
fresh ideas quite like borrowing the
name of an 80-plus-year-old policy pro-
gram and just adding the color
‘‘green.’’
So what is this thing all about? That
turns out to be an interesting question.
It depends on whom you ask. The
Democrats who authored it say it is a
massive reorganization and govern-
ment takeover of our Nation’s econ-
omy and our culture. Some have ar-
gued it is the only way to stop the
world from ending in about a decade.
This was interesting news, even to
many of their fellow Democrats. Our
colleague Senator DURBIN reacted this
way:
I have read it, and I have reread it, and I
asked [Senator] Ed Markey: ‘‘What in the
heck is this?’’
That was the assistant Democratic
leader.
But it looks like, one way or the
other, the Democratic Party as a whole
is eager to get behind this great idea.
So what is in it? Here are just a few
of the hits in the 16-page resolution the
Senate will soon be voting on.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1498 February 27, 2019
Here is one you will like: ‘‘Upgrading
all existing buildings in the United
States and building new buildings.’’
Don’t want a Federal bureaucrat to
decide how your house should look or
what size it should be? Don’t want to
pay to rebuild the entire downtown?
Don’t want to tear down your small
business so it can be replaced by the
government? Too bad. These new social
planners know best.
Here is another quote: ‘‘Meeting 100
percent of the power demand in the
United States’’—listen to this—with-
out using any American fossil fuels or
nuclear power whatsoever.
That is right. It is the War on Coal
on steroids. Say goodbye to all of those
jobs, and say hello to a new wave of
cronyism that would make the half a
billion dollars in taxpayer losses from
Solyndra look like pocket change. Ev-
erything in your garage will have to go
too. A lengthy background document
that this plan’s authors have since
tried to scrub from the internet help-
fully explains that a Green New Deal
would mean ‘‘replac[ing] every combus-
tion engine vehicle.’’
How about this one: ‘‘Guaranteeing a
job . . . to all people of the United
States.’’
That one is buried on page No. 14—a
government-guaranteed job for every-
one. That may sound like a good uto-
pian goal, but their handy background
document makes the real intention
known, promising ‘‘economic security
for all’’—listen to this—even for those
who are ‘‘unwilling to work.’’
That is a lot of magic wand-waving,
but I have only scratched the surface.
The background document also called
for a plan to ‘‘build out high-speed rail
at a scale where air travel stops becom-
ing necessary.’’ As our colleague Sen-
ator HIRONO pointed out, this might be
a tough sell in Hawaii or in Puerto
Rico or in other places. The Governor
of California just scaled back a high-
speed rail project in California because,
as he put it, it ‘‘would cost too much
and, respectfully, take too long.’’ Even
with heavy Federal subsidies, it is bil-
lions over budget and behind schedule.
That document also promised to,
magically, ‘‘remove pollution and . . .
emissions from manufacturing’’ just
like that. I wonder why nobody has
thought of that before.
So it is clear what we have here. It is
the far left’s Santa Claus wish list that
is dressed up to look like serious pol-
icy.
Bad ideas are nothing new, and silly
proposals come and go, but the philoso-
phies and the ideas behind this text-
book socialism are not just foolish;
they are dangerous. Their ascent in the
Democratic Party is a real threat to
American prosperity and to working
families.
Chairman BARRASSO reported that
one analysis found that this proposal
could increase the average household’s
power bills by as much as—listen to
this—$3,800 a year. Another estimate
predicted that families would have to
spend hundreds of billions of dollars
just to replace common household ap-
pliances with Washington-approved
models.
What about the total cost to the gov-
ernment for this socialist shopping
spree? One recent estimate has that
pegged at a cool $93 trillion over the
first 10 years—more than the combined
GDP of the entire world. Let me say
that again. Their plan is predicted to
cost more than the entire economic
output of every country on Earth com-
bined.
Remember what the American people
are supposedly getting in return—a
sprawling socialist state to rule over
us, a host of good jobs and key indus-
tries ripped away, and an end to every
energy source that the middle class can
actually afford. Remember, China has
already sailed past the United States
in terms of carbon emissions. The far
left still wants us to unilaterally dis-
arm our whole economy—lots of pain
for us and no meaningful gain in con-
taining global emissions. We will go
bankrupt, but at least it will be great
for China. I bet they are cheering in
the streets.
So the way I see it—the way most
Republicans see it—is this proposal is
either a brilliant piece of comedy or a
disastrous socialist vision that is to-
tally alien to the United States of
America.
What about our Democratic col-
leagues? Where do they stand?
Recently, I announced that Senators
will get to go on record and vote for or
against all of this, but curiously
enough, this planned vote was met
with outrage from the very people who
were claiming to champion the pro-
posal.
Last night, our colleague from Rhode
Island said it was ‘‘truly preposterous’’
for me to schedule a vote on the Green
New Deal. That is not exactly a ringing
endorsement of a plan the Democrats
claim to support. He does not seem to
be alone in his uneasiness. At one
point, the Speaker of the House dis-
missed her party’s own plan as the
‘‘green dream.’’ The senior Senator
from California worried publicly the
other day that there is no way to pay
for it. As I noted, the assistant Demo-
cratic leader summed up a lot of peo-
ple’s thinking when he asked: ‘‘What in
the heck is this?’’ I think a great many
Americans all across the country are
asking themselves the very same
thing—what the heck is this?
Before much longer, every Member of
this body will have a chance to go on
record, loud and clear. Do our Demo-
cratic colleagues really support this
fantasy novel that is masquerading as
public policy? Do they really want to
completely upend Americans’ lives to
enact some grand socialist vision? Do
they really want this to be their Demo-
cratic Party? Well, before long, the
Senate will vote, and these questions
will be answered.
Mr. President, I suggest the absence
of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader is recognized.
THE GREEN NEW DEAL
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I
heard Leader MCCONNELL knocking the
Green New Deal. I would ask the lead-
er—and we are going to keep asking
him and every Republican in this
Chamber—what they would do about
climate change, about global warming.
So, Leader MCCONNELL, do you be-
lieve that climate change, global
warming, is real? Yes or no.
Second, do you believe that climate
change, global warming, is caused by
humans?
And, three, do you believe that Con-
gress should take immediate action to
deal with the problem?
Until Leader MCCONNELL and his Re-
publican majority answer those ques-
tions, the games they are playing here
will have no meaning. This is not a de-
bate. It is a diversion. It is a sham.
Democrats will be introducing a reso-
lution in a few days—shortly—that
says we believe in these three things,
and we will be asking our Republicans
if they support or oppose that resolu-
tion.
The silence of the Republican major-
ity on climate change is enormous. Is
it because the oil industry gives so
much money to our Republican
friends? Is it because they are
antiscience? What is the reason?
Not a single bill has been brought to
the floor to deal with climate change
or global warming in the 5 years Lead-
er MCCONNELL has been the majority
leader. What is your plan, Leader
MCCONNELL? What is your answer? We
know what you don’t like. What do you
like? Anything?
NORTH KOREA
Now, the Trump administration is in
the middle of two crucial negotiations
with foreign capitals, the result of
which will have ramifications for dec-
ades.
In Vietnam, President Trump will
meet with Chairman Kim to continue
discussions over the denuclearization
of the Korean Peninsula, while at the
same time administration officials con-
tinue negotiations with Beijing over a
major trade pact. In both instances,
President Trump would have the best
chance of having success if he articu-
lated clear objectives and maintained a
hard line until those objectives were
achieved.
For a time, that approach—the right
approach—seemed to hold sway at the
White House, as sanctions and tariffs
brought both North Korea and China to
the negotiating table. Recently, how-
ever, President Trump seems headed

down the path of capitulation on both
North Korea and China, prepared to
trade away our leverage in exchange
for flimsy agreements. The President
can’t seem to stick to a policy, even
when it is beginning to work. So eager
is he for that quick photo op.
There is an old expression that
March comes in like a lion and goes
out like a lamb. Well, based on all re-
ports, when it comes to North Korea
and China, spring is coming a little
early at the White House. President
Trump, on both China and North
Korea, came in like a lion, with tough
rhetoric and hard-line policies, but now
President Trump is poised to go out
like a lamb, meekly accepting half-
baked agreements from both capitals
for the sheer sake of it.
In North Korea the highest priority
of U.S. foreign policy has been the
complete, verifiable, and irreversible
denuclearization of the Korean Penin-
sula, as well as the cessation of human
rights abuses by the brutal, despotic,
and murderous Kim regime. But just
this weekend, before leaving for Hanoi,
President Trump said: ‘‘I don’t want to
rush anybody; as long as there’s no
testing, we’re happy.’’ That is a far cry
from the complete denuclearization
that he called for in the past, and it
signals a dangerous softening of our po-
sition before the talks even started.
The irony of ironies is that for all the
talk of ‘‘maximum pressure’’ and ‘‘fire
and fury,’’ President Trump’s stance on
North Korea may wind up far weaker
than Hillary Clinton’s. I know he
doesn’t like to hear that, but the truth
is the truth.
President Trump seems more inter-
ested in touting his warm relationship
with Chairman Kim as an accomplish-
ment in and of itself. President
Trump’s calling a brutal autocrat a
friend on Twitter is no substitute for
actually achieving something for the
American people in Hanoi.
I hate to say it, but it would be abso-
lutely incredible and even pathetic if
President Trump were giving in to
North Korea for the sake of a photo op
to knock Michael Cohen’s hearing from
the front page, but if the past behavior
of the President is any guide, some-
thing like that is, unfortunately, to-
tally conceivable.
CHINA
Now, Mr. President, the same situa-
tion is playing out in China. After
starting down the right path, press re-
ports indicate that President Trump
appears to accept something far short
of his initial aims. President Trump
has already started promoting a ‘‘sign-
ing summit’’ at Mar-a-Lago before an
agreement has even been inked. Just
imagine how that undercuts our nego-
tiators—to say already he is going to
sign something when we are eyeball to
eyeball with the Chinese. That is not
the art of the deal. That is the art of
capitulation.
As the Times reported this morning,
‘‘Mr. Trump has grown impatient with
the talks, and a consensus is growing
in Washington that Mr. Trump will ul-
timately accept a weak deal.’’ Shame
on him if he does.
China is robbing and stealing our
family jewels: American industrial
know-how, American information tech-
nology, Americans’ ability to do
things.
When we are good at it, China doesn’t
let us in and compete, unless we give
them all of the knowledge of how to do
it themselves, and China steals our in-
tellectual property. Just 2 weeks ago,
there was another hacking—and now
we are going to capitulate?
What the Times goes on to say is
that ‘‘the Chinese have so far declined
to make concrete commitments to re-
form their economy that the adminis-
tration has demanded’’—these are the
words of the New York Times—‘‘includ-
ing ending China’s practice of sub-
sidizing companies, engaging in cyber-
theft and forcing American companies
to hand over intellectual property to
Chinese partners in order to do busi-
ness there.’’
Even our business community does
not want the President to capitulate. I
met with a bunch of them. They want
him to stay strong. Everyone wants
him to stay strong. Now he is caving.
This President cannot take a policy
and pursue it to its end. His attention
span is so small, his desire for imme-
diate gratification seems to be so large
that the American worker loses. If we
capitulate to China, that American
worker will lose for decades. That
American worker’s children will lose.
So I say to President Trump, it
would be a momentous failure if you
relent now and don’t receive meaning-
ful, enforceable, and verifiable commit-
ments on structural reforms to China’s
unfair trade policy. Simply buying
more soybeans or buying more mate-
rials or planes is not going to solve the
structural problem, and in a few
months China will continue to unfairly
gain on us—not right.
So, I wonder, where are all the sup-
posed hawks? Where is Secretary
Pompeo on China and North Korea?
Where is Ambassador Bolton? Do they
feel they can argue internally with the
President and he overrules them and
that is that? What good is it for them
to be there? Oh, yes, they can say: It
would have been even worse if we
weren’t there. That is no way to do pol-
icy when either American safety, in re-
gard to North Korea, or American eco-
nomic prosperity in the future, in re-
gard to China, is at stake.
I believe Ambassador Lighthizer has
made a sincere effort to do the right
thing on China, but his efforts are con-
strained by a President who seems in-
tent on weakening his hand every few
weeks. Again, where is Bolton? Where
is Pompeo? Where are they? They have
been hawks on these two issues their
whole lives. Now they get in the ad-
ministration; they just go along, when
they were among the loudest critics of
President Obama and President Clin-
ton? Not right. Not good for America.
It just so happens that two of Presi-
dent Trump’s signature foreign policy
issues will come to a head at roughly
the same time. There are historic op-
portunities here to make America safe
by removing nuclear weapons from a
rogue regime and to end two decades of
rapacious Chinese trade policy. We can
finally put American companies on a
level playing field with our largest
competitor. If the President, having
brought the Chinese to the table with
tough sanctions and tariffs, takes 10
percent or 20 percent of what we can
get, that would be very bad for this
country, American workers, and Amer-
ican incomes. As they continue to stay
flat or decline, one of the main reasons
is unfair trade practices by China. We
have to be strong and tough. We can
win this fight if we can stay strong.
The bottom line is this. If over the
course of the 1 month President Trump
capitulates to both Beijing and
Pyongyang, the foreign policy of his
Presidency will be in shambles. It will
zig and zag to no real accomplishment.
More importantly, the national secu-
rity and economic security of the
American people will greatly suffer as
a consequence.
I yield the floor.

jority whip is recognized.
THE GREEN NEW DEAL
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, in a doc-
ument later removed from her website,
one of the Green New Deal’s sponsors
had this to say about the Green New
Deal: ‘‘The question isn’t how we will
pay for it, but what we will do with our
new shared prosperity.’’
‘‘The question isn’t how we will pay
for it . . .’’ That was the quote. That is
a pretty staggering statement when
you consider that the Green New Deal
plans to upend most of American soci-
ety as we know it, from transportation
to healthcare, but I suspect there was a
simple reason the Green New Deal au-
thors didn’t want to talk about how to
pay for it—because they couldn’t figure
out how.
This week, one think tank released a
first estimate of what the Green New
Deal would cost, and here is the an-
swer: between $51 trillion and $93 tril-
lion over 10 years—between $51 trillion
and $93 trillion. Those numbers are so
large that they are almost impossible
to process.
Just for perspective, consider the
fact that the entire Federal budget for
2019 is less than $5 trillion. That is the
entire Federal budget—defense spend-
ing, domestic priorities, Medicare and
Medicaid, Social Security, everything.
The Green New Deal could end up
costing $9.3 trillion each year—double
the current Federal budget—and the
government would still have to pay for
a lot of other priorities on top of that.
That money wouldn’t cover defense
spending, or Social Security, or a num-
ber of other urgent needs.
The Green New Deal would assuredly
raise Americans’ energy bills, but that
is just a tiny fraction of what Demo-
crats’ Green New Deal, which goes far

beyond mere energy policy, would cost
American families. It is difficult to
even imagine the staggering tax hikes
that would be required to pay for this
plan.
This plan would never be paid for just
by taxing the well-off. That is always
the argument we hear. Taxing every
household making more than $200,000 a
year at a 100-percent rate for 10 years
would leave the Democrats far short of
$93 trillion. Taxing every family mak-
ing more than $100,000 a year at a 100-
percent rate for 10 years would still
leave Democrats far short of $93 tril-
lion. In short, actually implementing
this so-called Green New Deal would
involve taking money not just from the
well-off but from working families in
this country—and not a little bit of
money either.
Ninety-three trillion dollars breaks
down to over $600,000 per household.
That is over 10 times the median
household income in my State of South
Dakota.
Should the Democratic Green New
Deal come to pass, ordinary Americans
would see incredible tax hikes. Middle-
class Americans would see a substan-
tial and permanent reduction in their
standard of living.
When we talk about Democrats’ so-
cialist fantasies, we tend to quickly
fasten on the staggering costs of these
programs, but it is important to also
remember what else they would cost
Americans.
Socialism just doesn’t come with a
staggering pricetag; it also comes with
less freedom, fewer choices, and less
control of your own destiny.
Socialized medicine like Medicare for
All wouldn’t mean just big tax hikes; it
would mean giving up your private in-
surance plan, even if you like your cov-
erage. It would mean being forced onto
the government’s healthcare plan,
whether you like it or not. It would
mean waiting in long lines. It would
mean long wait times you can’t do any-
thing to avoid.
The Green New Deal would mean
higher electricity bills and higher
taxes, but it would also mean limited
transportation choices, including no
airplane travel, increased government
control over your housing options, less
reliable energy, and the list goes on.
Democrats’ socialist fantasies would
cost Americans untold amounts of
money and permanently damage our
economy, but the loss of choice and
freedom would cost Americans even
more. Democrats’ green dream would
be a green nightmare for Americans
and American families.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if you
are a student of history, the speech you
just heard is not a new speech. It is a
speech that has been given repeatedly
in the Senate Chamber. It was back in
the 1930s, when a President named
Franklin Delano Roosevelt had an idea,
and the idea was radical at the time.
Here was the radical idea: Shouldn’t we
allow people, during the course of their
work-life, to put a little money away
and to invest for their retirement so
that when they reach the age of 65,
they will have a program called Social
Security?
That was considered a radical social-
ist idea, taking money from everyone
to create a positive program to help re-
tirees across America when they reach
retirement age. It takes away our free-
dom, they said. We ought to be able to
make our own choices in life. They re-
sisted it, but, fortunately, they failed
and in their failure allowed the cre-
ation of the Social Security Program,
which is the single most popular gov-
ernment program in America today.
Over 95 percent of Americans count on
Social Security to make sure that
when they reach retirement, there is
something there to take care of them,
but that wasn’t the end of the speech
you just heard. It was repeated again
in the 1960s because another Demo-
cratic President by the name of Lyn-
don Baines Johnson came up with a no-
tion that, perhaps, if people are going
to live a little longer and have Social
Security, they should also be able to
have affordable healthcare. So Lyndon
Baines Johnson suggested the creation
of Medicare.
What did the critics say about Medi-
care? Socialism; that you would collect
money from people all across America
just to provide for the benefits to those
who are retired; that you would take
away our freedom to make our own
savings plans for our future by saying
we have to pay into Medicare. It is an
attack on our freedom, they said. It is
a socialist idea, they said. Thank good-
ness they lost in that debate as well.
What happened, of course, was a cre-
ation of a Medicare Program, and we
can see what came about as a result of
it, a dramatic increase in the number
of hospitals in America and doctors in
America. We started taking healthcare
seriously when it came to senior citi-
zens. What is the proof in the pudding?
Senior citizens started living longer
and longer lives. They were healthier,
they were independent, they were
strong because of this so-called social-
ist program of Medicare.
So if you listened this morning as
Republican leaders came to the floor
and decried socialism again, what is
their point now? Their point now is,
they believe that if we make a national
effort toward dealing with climate
change and global warming, it is so-
cialism. It takes away our freedom.
I would agree with them in this re-
spect. If we do something as a nation,
a sensible approach that is moderate,
constructive, and positive, it is going
to change the future. It is going to
take away the opportunity that some
of us will have to leave a planet for our
children that is uninhabitable.
Does anyone doubt—does anyone
doubt—that we are dealing with some
change in the climate that we face
around this world? Does anyone doubt
that the scientific evidence, year after
year after year, about the increased
temperature of this planet has had a
negative impact on the world we live
in—more extreme weather events than
we have ever seen, tornadoes in
Taylorville, IL, in December?
Listen, I grew up in Illinois. I was
awakened many times in the summer
to get down in the basement because
there was a tornado warning. My par-
ents were worried about it. It was part
of growing up in the Midwest, part of
growing up in Illinois. I don’t recall
ever going down to the basement
around Christmas. It turns out that
tornado season in Illinois, and many
other places, is now becoming a year-
round event and flooding and fires and
flooding in the city of Miami. All of
these things are evidence to me that
something is going on, and we have the
scientific explanation. Greenhouse gas
emissions are creating a different envi-
ronment, warming our planet, chang-
ing our weather patterns.
I have come to the floor repeatedly
over the last several years and asked
one basic question, can anyone name
any major political party in the world
today—any major political party in the
world today—that, like the Republican
Party of the United States, denies cli-
mate change?
I make that open challenge over and
over again on the floor and have never
had a Republican come to me and say:
No, there is another party somewhere
that takes our position on the issue
that climate change is a fallacy and a
fiction. I will tell you, though—maybe
I am not supposed to repeat this—but
one Republican Senator, after I made
that challenge over and over again,
drew me aside in the elevator, looked
in both directions, and said: I think
there is a political party in Australia
that also denies climate change. That
is as good as it gets—one more party
somewhere halfway around the world.
When Senator SCHUMER, the Demo-
cratic leader, comes to the floor and
challenges the Republican leader, Sen-
ator MCCONNELL, with the basic ques-
tions, I believe we have the right to
ask for an answer.
To the Republicans, to my friend
from South Dakota who just spoke, to
Senator MCCONNELL of Kentucky, the
first question is this: Do you believe
that there is such a thing as climate
change and global warming? That is a
pretty easy question. The scientists
overwhelmingly believe it. I do too.
The second question that Senator
SCHUMER has posed to them is this: Do
you believe that our human activity
has something to do with it? Well, the
scientific evidence is overwhelming
again. Once we got into the industrial
age and starting spewing all of the
smoke and chemicals into the air,
things started warming up on this
planet Earth.
The third question that Senator
SCHUMER has posed to the Republicans
is basically fundamental, as well: What

are you going to do about it? The an-
swer is obvious. For the 4 years the Re-
publicans have been in control in the
Senate, they have done nothing—noth-
ing. Now they have a President who
has the United States as the only coun-
try in the world—the only Nation on
Earth—that has withdrawn from the
Paris accord, which tried to create a
global strategy to deal with climate
change.
The President is enthralled by the
notion that climate change is a fallacy,
a fiction, and so are the Senate Repub-
licans. So any effort to address this is
socialism. Any idea that we should
come together as a nation and work to-
ward a planet that our kids can live on
is taking away our freedom. Well, we
know better.
Under President Obama, we started
moving toward more fuel-efficient cars
and trucks. A gallon of gas is giving us
more mileage because of government
policy. Well, I guess it took away the
freedom of gas guzzlers, but we can at
least say we made a positive step for-
ward, and this administration is step-
ping backward, and they are doing it
for the fossil fuel industry—for oil and
gas and coal interests. They are com-
ing to the floor and trying to get us
into a fight, once again, over socialism
when we talk about government poli-
cies that would guide us in the right di-
rection for the future.
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS
Mr. President, I come to the floor
this morning to give the first of what
may turn out to be many speeches on a
subject that affects every single Amer-
ican. The question is the rising cost of
prescription drugs in this country.
The first drug that I wanted to ad-
dress, I wanted to choose carefully be-
cause I wanted to choose a drug that
really is important to the largest num-
ber of Americans. So I thought to my-
self, what is the most commonly used
life-or-death drug in America today?
There is some debate about it, but I am
going to suggest that it is insulin.
In 1923—almost 100 years ago—re-
searchers were awarded the Nobel Prize
for the groundbreaking discovery of in-
sulin to treat diabetes—1923.
The chief scientist in the discovery
was Dr. Frederick Banting. He believed
that insulin should be accessible to ev-
eryone. His team sold the patent to the
University of Toronto for $1 so that
‘‘no one could secure a profitable mo-
nopoly’’ on the production of insulin.
That might seem hard to believe today,
with the price of insulin having in-
creased more than 600 percent over the
past two decades.
Take a look at the chart, which maps
the increases in price. Eli Lilly’s block-
buster insulin drug, Humalog, was in-
troduced in 1996 at a cost of $21. By
2019, the cost went up to $329.
Sanofi’s Lantus was $35 when it came
to the market in 2001. It now costs $270.
The insulin drug, NovoLog, cost $40 in
2001. By 2018, it went up to $289—for in-
sulin.
How many Americans are affected by
this? There are 30 million Americans
who live with type 1 or type 2 diabe-
tes—almost 10 percent of our popu-
lation. Approximately 7.5 million of
them rely on insulin to manage their
blood sugar levels. It is a matter of life
and death. Yet patients are suffering
because of these dramatic price spikes.
A recent study found that one-quar-
ter of patients who rely on insulin have
been forced to ration their doses due to
cost, basically in contravention of the
advice of their doctors.
This is a story that many of us have
heard here. Last year, we heard from
the mother of Alec Raeshawn Smith.
He went off his mom’s health insur-
ance. Under the Affordable Care Act,
he could remain covered until he
reached the age of 26. He had diabetes.
He had coverage for his insulin until he
reached the age of 26. Then he couldn’t
afford to buy health insurance. So
when he went off of that insurance, he
was faced with the monthly cost of his
insulin out of pocket. That monthly
cost was $1,000.
He managed a little restaurant, and
he couldn’t come up with $1,000. So he
decided that he would ration his insu-
lin and not take as much as was re-
quired by his doctor, trying to make it
last between paychecks. Alec died as a
result of that decision.
How is it that in the richest country
on Earth, patients are having to ration
their insulin or start GoFundMe
websites just to survive?
Insulin was a cure found in the 20th
century that patients now cannot af-
ford in the 21st century. Pharma’s war
on patients with diabetes must come to
an end.
Yesterday, there was a hearing, wide-
ly televised, where seven or eight of
the CEOs of major pharmaceutical
companies faced the music before the
Senate Finance Committee. Senator
GRASSLEY, Senator WYDEN, and many
others asked questions about the issue
I am raising today: What is going on?
Why are you raising prices so high?
There were no good answers coming
from these executives.
Today, I am going to start high-
lighting on the floor of the Senate the
egregious cases of pharmaceutical
greed in the United States.
Years ago, there was a Senator from
Wisconsin named William Proxmire.
He was an unusual man. He was far dif-
ferent than most Senators today. He
was the type of fellow who would show
up at the University of Wisconsin
games, passing out cards. That was his
style of campaigning. He didn’t spend a
lot of money on television and radio.
He really was a grassroots politician,
and he was a tenacious fellow. He
started something called the Golden
Fleece Award—Proxmire of Wisconsin’s
Golden Fleece Award. Once a month or
more, he would come to the floor and
talk about waste—taxpayer waste—in
our Federal Government. It developed
a national reputation.
In deference to Senator Proxmire,
whom I had a chance to meet when I
was a college student, I am going to
try to follow in his tradition by point-
ing out egregious examples of greed by
the pharmaceutical industry in the
United States on a regular basis with
the Pharma Fleece Award.
My first Pharma Fleece Award is for
the pharmaceutical industry’s extor-
tion of 7.5 million diabetic patients in
America who depend on insulin. This is
a lifesaving product that has been
around for almost a century.
How can the most common life-and-
death drug be so expensive? First, the
United States is an outlier. The same
companies I am talking about sell ex-
actly the same drug in other countries
around the world for a fraction of the
cost.
The United States represents only 15
percent of all of the global insulin mar-
ket; yet we generate more than half—
more than 50 percent—of Pharma’s rev-
enue for this drug.
How can Lantus cost $372 in the
United States? The exact same drug
made by the same company costs $46 in
France and $67 in Canada. Why? Why
are we paying five, six, and seven times
more in the United States for exactly
the same drug? It is because the gov-
ernments of France and Canada care
about the cost, and they say to the
company Sanofi, in this case, that
makes Lantus: If you want to sell
Lantus in Canada, we are not going to
let you hike the prices and raise them
to the high heavens. We are going to
keep the prices reasonable so that the
people of Canada can afford this life-
saving drug. What do we do in the
United States? Nothing. We let them
charge whatever they wish.
How can Lantus cost $372 for Ameri-
cans, while the same, exact drug for
the French is $46, and just across the
border, in Canada, it is $67?
Our problem is that our system
doesn’t function as a free market.
There is virtually no competition.
Three companies control the insulin
supply in America: Eli Lilly, Sanofi,
and Novo Nordisk.
Typically, in a free market, three
competitors would lower the prices,
wouldn’t they? But in America, these
three charge as much as they can and
get away with it because they are pro-
tected by government-granted monopo-
lies.
We should reward innovation, we
should promote research, and we
should ensure that companies do make
a profit for their good work, but abu-
sive manufacturers should not be pro-
tected from competition by our govern-
ment.
Lantus has been on the market since
the year 2000. Sanofi has received 49
secondary patents on insulin. What
does that mean? They have created a
fortress around this lucrative drug for
a 37-year monopoly in offering this
drug for sale in America.
Unfortunately, there is no effective
deterrent today against Big Pharma’s
greed and price gouging on these and so
many other drugs. That is why, earlier
this month, I introduced a bill called

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1502 February 27, 2019
the Forcing Limits on Abusive and Tu-
multuous Prices Act, or FLAT Prices
Act. This legislation will discourage
and deter the pharmaceutical industry
from raising prices by reducing the
government monopoly periods when
they do.
You see, companies are awarded mo-
nopoly periods from 5 to 12 years by
the Food and Drug Administration for
drug approval beyond the patent pro-
tection. My FLAT Prices Act would re-
duce this FDA-granted exclusivity pe-
riod for a drug whose price increases
more than 10 percent a year, bringing
generic competitors into the market-
place, creating real competition, and
trying to lower prices for Americans.
That brings us to another issue.
Today, there remains no generic, no
biosimilar insulin that can be sub-
stituted in a pharmacy. Think about it.
Almost a century after the discovery of
human insulin and even half a century
after the discovery of synthetic and
analog insulin, we still don’t have a ge-
neric insulin for sale in America that is
affordable.
I will acknowledge that these
changes in insulin have improved the
quality of life for patients. They have
made them safer, more effective, and
more convenient, but these changes
have delayed the development of ge-
neric substitutes.
There are other reasons the FDA has
regulated insulin as a drug rather than
as a biologic, placing insulin under a
framework with a much higher bar
than generics to prove they are sub-
stitutes. Thanks to the Affordable Care
Act—ObamaCare—the Food and Drug
Administration is supposed to be shift-
ing its regulatory process for insulin to
enable copycat versions, known as
biosimilars, to be approved quickly.
Unfortunately, FDA’s plan to imple-
ment this law will not bring relief to
patients any time soon.
I do believe that the Food and Drug
Administration Commissioner, Dr.
Gottlieb, truly wants to lower costs
and spur competition. I wasn’t con-
vinced when his nomination came up
for a vote, but I have had subsequent
conversations with him, and I think he
is genuine. I think he wants to see the
prices come down.
However, the Food and Drug Admin-
istration’s current plan will effectively
freeze the approval process for lower
cost insulin and force generic insulin
makers who are under review to resub-
mit their new applications each year.
This creates a 2-year lockup where it
is unlikely that any new insulin com-
petitors will come to market. Amer-
ica’s diabetic patients cannot wait.
That is why Senator CRAMER, a Re-
publican from North Dakota, and I are
sending a letter urging the Food and
Drug Administration to revise and
bring flexibility to this process so we
can get the lower cost insulin on the
market approved sooner.
Two weeks ago, I received a little
note from a constituent in Mount
Vernon, IL. That is downstate, near
where my father was born. He wrote
that both he and his daughter had been
diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 1997.
At that time, their Humalog insulin
cost $10. Today, he writes that the cost
is $300 a bottle, and he needs six bottles
a month.
His monthly costs have risen from
$600 to $1,800. Here is what he said in
this letter:
At some point, drug companies must be
held to account for the actions they are tak-
ing. These cost increases are costing Amer-
ican citizens to choose between insulin and
eating in many cases. I’m tired of listening
to all the excuses. . . . what is it going to
take for Congress to do its job?
I agree with my constituent. Con-
gress needs to step up and demand real
change. The sky-high cost of life-or-
death insulin is literally killing Ameri-
cans.
My work with Senator CRAMER to
speed FDA approval of lower cost insu-
lin and my bill to shorten monopolies
for abusive pharma companies are a
start. This pharma fleecing of insulin
patients across America must end.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
SASSE). The Senator from Iowa.
PROPOSED RULES CHANGE
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I am
pleased to be joined today on the floor
by my colleagues to discuss the unprec-
edented levels of obstruction aimed at
President Trump’s nominees. This
issue plagued the 115th Congress, and it
is one I am hopeful we can remedy
moving forward in this new session.
The Senate is tasked with the crit-
ical role of providing advice and con-
sent on many of the President’s nomi-
nations, including executive branch of-
ficials and Federal judges. Vetting
these officials is a task that I take ex-
tremely seriously, and I have often
welcomed discussion regarding these
critical appointments with my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle, as
well as my constituents.
We can all agree that these positions
must be filled by our Nation’s most
qualified candidates, individuals who
are committed to public service and
upholding the values and principles
that make our Nation so great. We
should also be able to agree that these
positions should be filled using an ex-
pedient and timely process.
As any Iowa small business owner
can tell you, if you don’t have employ-
ees, you can’t function. Iowans and
many others across this Nation expect
the Federal Government to run on the
same commonsense principle.
The recent levels of obstruction for
the President’s nominees have not only
kept the executive branch and our Fed-
eral courts from staffing critical posi-
tions but have also prevented the Sen-
ate from moving forward on other crit-
ical legislative priorities and initia-
tives.
In the past, the Senate has been able
to disagree on certain nominations and
still move forward in a respectful and
expedient manner to ensure that the
Federal Government operates effi-
ciently. However, during President
Trump’s first Congress, my colleagues
on the other side of the aisle have uti-
lized a series of procedural tactics to
eat up time on the Senate floor and to
stall the President’s nominees.
To put this in perspective, during
President George W. Bush’s first Con-
gress, the Senate forced a cloture vote
on nominations only 4 times. That was
during President Bush’s first Congress.
So it was 4 times.
During President Clinton’s first Con-
gress, this increased to a mere 8 clo-
ture votes—8 cloture votes for Clinton.
During President Obama’s first Con-
gress, the use of this tactic still re-
mained minimal, with only 12 cloture
votes on nominations. So it was Bush,
4; Clinton, 8; and President Obama, 12.
Compare that to the use of cloture
votes during the 115th Congress. My
Democratic colleagues forced cloture
votes 128 times—128 times. That is 10
times more often than during Presi-
dent Obama’s first Congress.
Despite that President Trump sub-
mitted nearly the same number of
nominees as President Obama, 29 per-
cent more Obama nominees than
Trump nominees were confirmed dur-
ing each President’s respective first
Congress. Yet these delays have often
not been used to raise objections to
controversial or unqualified nominees.
That is just not the case.
In fact, nearly half of all recorded
cloture votes—48 percent, to be exact—
received 60 or more votes to end de-
bate. Furthermore, nearly a third re-
ceived 70 or more votes to end debate.
These nominees were confirmed with
widespread bipartisan support.
Cloture was not invoked in order to
extensively debate the merits or the
qualifications of those candidates. In-
stead, this procedural tactic has been
used to run down the clock and prevent
the Senate from moving forward with
other important business.
Many nominees from my home State
of Iowa have been fortunate enough to
escape some of these political games. I
was proud to see the Senate reach an
agreement in September to move for-
ward and confirm Judge C.J. Williams
to the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Iowa by a 79-to-12
vote. I am also glad that multiple U.S.
marshals and U.S. attorneys have been
able to fill critical Federal law enforce-
ment positions in Iowa after being con-
firmed by a voice vote in the Senate.
However, while many of these posi-
tions have been filled back in my home
State, Iowans are still greatly harmed
when the Senate fails to efficiently fill
executive branch positions whose du-
ties do impact the entire Nation.
Furthermore, many States across our
Nation have faced unnecessary chal-
lenges to filling critical positions after
cloture was invoked for noncontrover-
sial nominees.
Take a State like Alabama, for ex-
ample. Judge Annemarie Carney Axon
received bipartisan support from both

of her home State Senators for her
nomination to serve on the U.S. Dis-
trict Court for the Northern District of
Alabama. However, Democrats forced a
cloture vote on her nomination before
confirming her by a vote of 83 to 11.
Similarly, Judge Terry Doughty was
confirmed to be a judge on the U.S.
District Court for the Western District
of Louisiana by a 98-to-0 vote after a
forced cloture vote.
These are not isolated examples. Just
last year, multiple district judge nomi-
nees in Kentucky and Texas received
the support of more than 90 Senators,
but only after their nomination was
first stalled, again, by an unnecessary
cloture vote.
We cannot continue to allow the Sen-
ate to be bogged down by unprece-
dented obstruction tactics. The Amer-
ican people expect and deserve a fully
functioning government with the right
personnel in place.
That is why I want to thank Leader
MCCONNELL for continuing to make
nominations such a priority and man-
aging to confirm so many Federal
judges, despite these tactics. I also
thank my colleagues, Senators BLUNT
and LANKFORD, for introducing a pro-
posal that accelerates the nomination
process for lower level nominees.
This commonsense proposal builds on
the previous Reid-Schumer rule affect-
ing Senate considerations of Obama
nominees during the 113th Congress—a
rule that garnered widespread bipar-
tisan support, including the agreement
of 35 of my Democratic colleagues who
still serve in the Senate today.
I urge my colleagues to support this
reasonable proposal that enables us to
move forward in a timely manner while
still encouraging input and debate on
those candidates. It is time for the
Senate to put a halt to these delay tac-
tics and get back to fulfilling our com-
mitments to the American people.
Again, I urge support of the proposal.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas.
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, maybe
the fastest way to put people to sleep is
to give a speech on cloture here in the
Senate, but I hope that is not the case,
because, as my colleague from Iowa
just pointed out, this is an abuse of the
Senate rules to do nothing but to ob-
struct and to slow down President
Trump’s well-qualified nominees for
important positions.
This is not about their qualifications.
This is not about exercising the con-
stitutional responsibility of advice and
consent. In virtually every instance in
which the clock has been burned to get
to an eventual vote, these largely non-
controversial nominees have been con-
firmed overwhelmingly.
Call it part of the ‘‘Trump derange-
ment’’ syndrome or the ‘‘never Trump’’
effort. It is very clear to me that rath-
er than take these nominees one at a
time, treat them fairly, assess their
qualifications, and vote on their nomi-
nation, these people are being delayed
and denied an opportunity to serve,
and many of them have just simply
given up because of the backlog of
nominations. It is unfair to them, it is
unfair to this administration, and it is
completely an abuse of the Senate
rules.
We know that our Democratic col-
leagues have unnecessarily blocked
nominees, put them through the ringer
in hearings, and, in one particular
case—the Kavanaugh nomination—en-
gaged in an all-out smear campaign.
This treatment has grabbed head-
lines, but the story that doesn’t get
much attention is what I want to talk
about now—this practice of eating up
time on the floor, using every second of
the rules to essentially eliminate the
possibility that we can take up other
bipartisan legislation or consider these
nominees on any sort of efficient and
effective basis.
As a result of the work, these nomi-
nees are being denied an opportunity to
serve, the floor is being occupied by
nominations that are uncontroversial,
and we are unable to get to other im-
portant work that the American people
want us to do.
Now, it is true that the Senate is not
known for speed, and, more often than
not, there is a good reason. When we
are appropriating taxpayer dollars or
debating sanctions on hostile govern-
ments or negotiating changes to our
healthcare system, speed is not always
an asset.
But when it comes to confirming
nominees—those who already have had
a hearing, who aren’t controversial,
who have already received a vote in
committee—the process should be able
to move rather quickly and efficiently.
But, as I said, this is part of a con-
certed effort to undermine the Trump
administration, to deny them the ap-
pointees necessary for them to conduct
the Nation’s business, and, in many in-
stances, these are Ambassadors who
should be representing the United
States of America in foreign countries
where it is important we maintain
good communication with those other
countries.
Over the last 2 years, our colleagues
on the other side of the aisle have
forced votes on nominees who in pre-
vious years would have sailed through
the Senate.
Let’s look at some of these numbers.
You can see how much red there is on
this chart—cloture votes in the first
Congress. President Trump had 128 clo-
ture votes, President Obama had 12,
President Bush had 4, and President
Clinton had 8. What that means is that,
for example, in the Clinton administra-
tion, there were 120 nominees who were
confirmed without the necessity of
even going through the procedure of
cloture. Frequently, these nominees
are either passed by voice vote or
unanimous consent or at some agreed
upon time. Even fewer required a clo-
ture vote under President George W.
Bush. There were 12 under President
Obama and 128 under President Trump.
If we were to continue down this same
path, we would not be able to do any-
thing else except consider nominations
by this President, and we still wouldn’t
get to the end of the list.
Our Democratic colleagues don’t
want to hold votes on these nominees
to support or oppose a nomination;
they simply want to waste the Senate’s
time and to test the patience of the
American people. The majority of
these nominees, as I said, aren’t con-
troversial. Nearly half received the
support of 60 or more Senators during
the cloture vote, and more than one-
third got 70-plus votes.
As I said, the delay and obstruction
have led to a long list of vacancies
across every Department and Agency.
Critical leadership positions have gone
unfulfilled while the nominees await
confirmation votes from the Senate. As
I said, many have simply given up, un-
willing to accept any more disruption
in their personal lives in the vain hope
that perhaps someday, somehow, they
will get a vote in the Senate. This list
includes Ambassadors, Federal judges,
Under Secretaries, Assistant Secre-
taries, and inspectors general. The list
continues to grow while our Demo-
cratic colleagues insist on votes that
will not change the outcome.
It is one thing to have a nominee
whose qualifications are controversial
or where a debate would enlighten the
Members of the Senate on how best to
cast their vote, but that is not what is
happening here.
Despite our repeated pleas for Demo-
crats to cooperate, things aren’t going
to change. That is why the rules
change we are contemplating is so im-
portant. It would expedite the process
for many nominees to receive a vote on
the floor. It won’t change the number
of votes they need to get confirmed—
they will still need to get a majority of
votes—or tilt the scale in their favor in
any way; it will simply make sure we
are not wasting time that is not being
used in order to delay or defeat nomi-
nations.
Ironically, we have been told by our
Senate colleagues on the other side
that if we were to pass a rule limiting
the postcloture time to 2 hours and we
would start it in 2021, at the end of
President Trump’s current term of of-
fice, they would vote for it. So this is
really an unprincipled and nakedly par-
tisan approach, because while they are
willing to do it for the next President—
and that could well be a second Trump
term, or it could well be another Presi-
dent—they won’t do it now, which dem-
onstrates the hypocrisy they are exhib-
iting.
What would happen is, a nominee
would get a hearing in front of the ap-
propriate committee. That would be
debated, and there would be a vote up
or down. If the nominee was passed out
of the committee and made available
to come to the floor, the Senate major-
ity leader could still file a paper asking
for a cloture vote. If that was obtained,
then the postcloture time would be re-
duced from 30 hours to 2 hours. In the

meantime, there would be an inter-
vening day during which debate would
occur. Every Senator would still enjoy
the right to vote against any nominee
they don’t support, but to just burn
time for time’s sake is an abuse of the
Senate rules and needs to stop. It is
not just hurting these nominees; it is
not just hurting the Senate; it is hurt-
ing the country. These Ambassadors,
judges, and appointed officials who
serve in the State Department, the De-
partment of Defense, and the inspec-
tors general who make sure that tax-
payer dollars are spent legally and effi-
ciently and that people are doing their
jobs—none of those positions are able
to be filled.
I would point out that this rule
change does not apply to all nominees.
High-level Cabinet positions and Su-
preme Court Justices would still re-
ceive the 30 hours of debate time after
51 Senators have voted to proceed to
that vote.
It is important to note that this type
of rules change isn’t new. Actually, in
2013, there was a negotiated, bipartisan
standing rule when Majority Leader
Harry Reid and the current Democratic
leader, CHUCK SCHUMER, introduced a
similar change to speed up the process,
and this simply builds on the founda-
tion they laid down. So if we asked
them to do now what was done then on
a bipartisan basis, their answer will be
no—for no good reason other than it is
President Trump who would presum-
ably benefit from this restoration of
that same process.
As I said, the real hypocrisy of their
position is indicated by the fact that
they said they would vote for this rule,
but they don’t want it to take effect
now. They want it to take effect in
2021. In short, they appear to believe
that what we are trying to do is an im-
portant rules change to make, but they
don’t want to do it if it benefits a
President they clearly despise.
This political theater is being orches-
trated by Senate Democrats and is im-
pacting our ability to carry out our
constitutional duty of advice and con-
sent. I believe this is a necessary step
to get the Senate back on track, and I
will support this rules change when it
comes to the floor for a vote and would
encourage all of my colleagues to do
the same.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise
today as one of a number of our col-
leagues to talk about something that
really bothers me. We are seeing his-
toric obstructionism in the Senate
today. It has been going on for the last
2 years.
One of the fundamental responsibil-
ities in the Senate is to provide advice
and consent on Presidential nomina-
tions. When President Trump took of-
fice, he acted with urgency to fill posi-
tions in his administration with highly
qualified and highly skilled, experi-
enced individuals from the real world—
not just people from the bubble but
people from America. Unfortunately,
Democrats have slow-walked this con-
firmation process every step of the
way. In my view, this is historic ob-
structionism, and it needs to stop.
This is the first time in U.S. history
that the minority party has not waived
the 30-hour debate rule to this degree.
As a result, of the 1,200 nominees to be
confirmed by any new President, only
714 have been confirmed to date. At the
end of last year, because of this his-
toric Democratic obstructionism, we
had 386 nominations in line waiting to
be confirmed. At the end of Obama’s
first 2 years, only 5 nominees were out-
standing, compared to the 386 for Presi-
dent Trump at the end of last year.
Let me say that again. At the end of
President Obama’s first 2 years, only
five nominees had not been confirmed.
That means that out of everybody he
sent to the Senate, only five at that
point had not been confirmed. How-
ever, at the end of December this past
year, President Trump still had 386
nominees in the pipeline right here in
the U.S. Senate, waiting for us to get
to them.
Of the last three Presidents, we have
collectively only had 24 cloture votes
required by the minority party—only
24. However, during President Trump’s
first 2 years, Democrats forced 128 clo-
ture votes on nominees on the Senate
floor. Each one of these cloture votes
requires 30 hours of debate. We can’t do
anything else on the floor while we are
doing that. That means the normal
business of the Senate cannot be trans-
acted because we are waiting, due to
the 30-hour debate rule, to get to the
vote. Basically, under those realities,
the Senate is able to do only one con-
firmation per week. Do the math—386
weeks is a long time.
What is going on here has nothing to
do with the nominees’ qualifications,
either. Every single one of Donald
Trump’s nominees who received a re-
corded vote was passed. Not one has
failed to pass in this body—not one.
The vast majority of these nominees
are noncontroversial and get more
than 70 or 80 votes and in some cases
more than that.
This chart shows that of the cloture
votes we have had to take, 48 percent
got more than 60 votes, and 37 percent
got more than 70. That means 70 per-
cent of the nominees got more than 60
votes. These are not controversial
nominees. That is not the issue.
My own cousin, who is now Secretary
of Agriculture, waited 4 months. I
know this personally because he
bunked in my place for 4 months while
we were waiting to get his confirma-
tion. When he finally got to the floor of
the Senate, he got 87 votes.
It is clear that the Democrats will
stop at nothing to obstruct the Senate
from working on real issues. Every
hour we have to spend in the 30-hour
waiting period is time we can’t utilize
to take up the country’s business and
the priorities Americans want us to be
working on. If this obstruction con-
tinues, President Trump will not have
his full team in place until the end of
his second term.
These delays are petty, and the
American people have had enough. I
hear about it every time I go home.
For the last 2 years, several of my
colleagues and I have pushed to keep
the Senate in session during the tradi-
tional August State work break in
order to confirm nominees and make
progress on funding the Federal Gov-
ernment. In August of 2017, the leader
of the majority party, Senator MCCON-
NELL, agreed to keep us here for the
month of August in order to work on
several things we were working on, in-
cluding confirming these nominees.
The minority party agreed, after 4
days, to basically confirm 77 nominees
on that one day. What makes that im-
portant is that prior to that time in
August, in all of that year, we had only
been able to get 44 nominees con-
firmed. While staying here last August,
in 2018, we confirmed 43 nominees and
completed 75 percent of the govern-
ment funding bills.
As I speak today, there are 249 nomi-
nees before the U.S. Senate waiting to
be confirmed. Basically, that would re-
quire 249 weeks to do if we follow the
rule we have been following over the
last 2 years. These nominees include
the Assistant Secretary of Readiness
for the Department of Defense, who has
been waiting to be confirmed for 8
months. This is in the Department of
Defense, the Assistant Secretary for
Readiness—one of the crisis areas we
have in our military. For 8 months this
nominee has been waiting to be con-
firmed. The Under Secretary for Food
Safety in the Department of Agri-
culture—one I hear a lot about—has
been waiting 9 months in line to be
confirmed.
The people on the other side are say-
ing: The President is just not sending
up nominees fast enough.
Well, what happens with these folks
who have been sitting here for 9
months waiting to be confirmed?
The Assistant Secretary for Eco-
nomic Development at the Department
of Commerce has been waiting to be
confirmed for 8 months.
These are not low-level nominees;
these are Assistant Secretaries who are
waiting to be confirmed.
This has to stop. This President is
not even able to form his own Cabinet
in complete terms because these As-
sistant Secretaries are not in place. We
should be working around-the-clock to
get these people confirmed.
If this obstructionism continues, we
should try to change the existing rules
for confirming nominees by reducing
the 30-hour debate rule at minimum.
There is a plan in the Senate right now
that would reduce the 30 hours of de-
bate to 8 hours for most and 2 hours for

some. Reducing the debate time re-
quired would speed up the confirmation
process and allow us to focus on other
business in the Senate that people
want us to address. Every single Demo-
crat in the Senate today who was also
here in 2013 supported reducing debate
time on nominees, and they should do
so again right now.
I will close by saying that despite
this historic obstructionism, the Sen-
ate has, indeed, over the last 2 years—
because we focused on this as a pri-
ority, even with this 30-hour debate
rule being enacted—we confirmed 63
district court judges, 31 circuit court of
appeals justices, and two Supreme
Court Justices. These judges will have
an impact on the judiciary for years to
come.
By the way, these are not activists
with political agendas or motives.
They are accomplished, experienced ju-
rists, dedicated to upholding the Con-
stitution and adhering to the rule of
law. It is criminal that we waited that
long to get these people confirmed.
I applaud the President for nomi-
nating such outstanding individuals to
these positions. If this historic obstruc-
tionism continues in the Senate, I be-
lieve President Trump will not have his
full team in place until the end of his
second term, if then. This obstruction
needs to end. The resistance movement
threatens the security of our country
and our ability to deal with the prob-
lems facing America today. It is time
to rise above this partisan gridlock,
change the rules, confirm these nomi-
nees, and finally begin to get results
for the American people.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I
come to the floor to talk about the IRS
and tax issues and the tax bill last
year, but following on what Senator
PERDUE said, I want to, first of all,
compliment him for not only this
speech but several times he has talked
about how the Senate has stalled time
after time on nominees.
I want to bring to my colleagues’ at-
tention that at one time, there was a
lot of concern by President Obama that
his nominees were not being confirmed
fast enough. We started hearing that in
January 2013. All of a sudden, there was
a feeling that we ought to have a bipar-
tisan solution to this issue to speed
along President Obama’s nominees. At
one time, the Democratic leader then
was talking about using a nuclear op-
tion to accomplish a change in rules.
Both Republicans and Democrats
thought that wasn’t a very good idea,
so Republicans and Democrats got to-
gether and agreed to reduce
postcloture debate time for the rest of
the 113th Congress, although, before
that Congress ended, Senator Reid de-
cided to use the nuclear option any-
way, and he did that at a later time.
If Republicans and Democrats could
get together in the 113th Congress to
speed up the time and have less
postcloture debate time, why can’t we
do it now? The problem, of course, is
for the Trump nominees being held up
in the Senate, the time is far worse
than it was under President Obama or,
for that matter, any other President
before that.
It seems to me, as we are talking
about changing the post-debate time
again—because there is a resolution
out of our Rules Committee—I think it
is about time that we think that what
is good for the goose is good for the
gander, and we ought to reinstate that
bipartisan agreement. I hope we can
get the support of Democrats to do
that like they had the support of Re-
publicans to do that when we had a
Democratic President.
I thank Senator PERDUE for what he
spoke about on a longer basis than I
just did, but I want to back him up
fully.
TAX REFORM
Mr. President, we are in the fifth
week of the tax filing season. Based on
all reports from the IRS, the filing sea-
son is running smoothly. All systems
are operating as expected. Returns are
being processed and refunds are being
sent out without any major complica-
tions.
According to IRS Commissioner
Rettig, his Agency has even set a cou-
ple of internal records for the speed at
which returns are being processed. At
one point, the IRS processed 1.9 million
returns in an hour. That is 536 every
single second.
Of course, you don’t hear much about
how the filing season is running
smoothly from our mainstream press.
There is a lot of positive news, but
positive news doesn’t seem to make
good headlines. Instead, an obsession
has developed around the size of the
tax returns, not the exact tax that
might actually be paid.
Let’s set aside that the available
Treasury data is merely in the first few
weeks of a very unusual tax season due
to the partial government shutdown.
Never mind that the size of the average
tax refund can vary greatly from week
to week, making year-over-year com-
parisons early in the filing season es-
sentially meaningless. Let’s ignore the
important fact that less than half as
many child tax credits and earned-in-
come tax credits have been issued as
compared to the last year based almost
entirely on calendar factors, and, most
importantly, we ought to somehow for-
get about the fact that the size of one’s
tax refund tells you absolutely nothing
about a taxpayers’ overall tax return.
I have been amazed by how many of
my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle, who should know better, have
sought to equate incomplete informa-
tion about lower average refunds—tell-
ing us all that means people have not
received a decrease in their taxes.
I want to quote Howard Gleckman,
who should be well respected by people
on the other side of the aisle because
he is a senior fellow at the liberal Tax
Policy Center. He characterized the
current obsession with tax refunds as
‘‘wrong-headed,’’ noting that it is ‘‘not
how big a refund check filers get this
year but how much total tax they paid
for 2018.’’ That is common sense. I
thank Howard Gleckman for his com-
mon sense.
Yet my colleagues—again, on the
other side—continue to try and push
the false narrative that a smaller re-
fund is synonymous with tax increase.
That doesn’t meet the commonsense
test.
Just such a claim by a Senate Demo-
crat running for President was ob-
served by the Washington Post’s Fact
Checker as being ‘‘nonsensical and mis-
leading.’’ The claim was awarded four
Pinocchios. Four Pinocchios is a rating
the Post reserves for the biggest whop-
pers.
Here are the straight facts. Anyone
telling the American public that a
smaller refund is the same as a tax in-
crease is being intentionally mis-
leading and doing a disservice to the
public. I classify that as a big lie. The
size of one’s tax refund merely reflects
what that taxpayer overpaid the IRS in
your paychecks last year. For the vast
majority of Americans, the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act of December 2017 deliv-
ered larger paychecks starting last
February. The liberal Tax Policy Cen-
ter confirms that 90 percent of middle-
income taxpayers will receive a tax
cut. That is right. Taxes went down,
not up, for the vast majority of Amer-
ican families.
This tax relief stems from the com-
bination of pro-middle-class and pro-
family provisions, including a nearly
doubled standard deduction, an in-
crease in the child tax credit from
$1,000 to $2,000, and overall lower tax
rates. That is how you give the middle
class a tax cut.
Some may believe that we would
have been better off depriving tax-
payers of their tax cuts until the IRS
sent them a refund after the end of the
year, but this thinking gets things ex-
actly backward. The excess tax with-
held from paychecks throughout the
course of a year doesn’t belong to the
government; it belongs to the tax-
payers who earned that money. It is
the taxpayers who should be able to de-
cide whether they want to put their
weekly or monthly tax savings in a re-
tirement account, pay down a credit
card bill, enroll their children in some
club, sport, music, or dance lessons, or
maybe even make an extra car pay-
ment.
I encourage all taxpayers interested
in how tax reform affects their bottom
line to compare this year’s tax return
with last year’s tax return. That is the
commonsense way of figuring out
whether your taxes went up or down as
a result of the tax bill of 2017. When
they do that, the vast majority will see
less of their hard-earned money being
sent to Washington, DC. Really, that is
what ought to matter.
I encourage those in the media who
are actually interested in how tax re-
form has affected taxpayers to take

into account the positive signs we see
all around. It is a positive sign when
we write about how blue-collar employ-
ment has surged; positive signs about
how low-income workers experienced
the highest wage growth in a decade;
positive signs when we report how new
business startups are climbing and how
U.S. manufacturers had their best year
since 1997; and positive signs as you
discuss how the economy grew almost
50 percent faster in 2018 than as Presi-
dent Obama’s economists predicted
when they predicted slow growth would
be the new normal.
All of these subjects are far more im-
portant than what has thus far, in
most all respects, been an uneventful
filing season. Compare this year’s tax
bottom line with last year’s tax bot-
tom line to decide whether you got a
tax decrease or a tax increase, not the
size of your refund.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask

PROSPOSED RULES CHANGE
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, 2
years ago, I came to this floor of the
Senate to talk about the rules process
and nominations in particular because,
even 2 years ago, we were experiencing
the beginning of what I saw to be a
trend.
When elected to office, every Presi-
dent has about 1,200 nominations that
have to come through the Senate for
what is called advice and consent.
Those individuals go through back-
ground checks at the White House,
they go through interviews through the
White House, and they go through the
extensive review of references. Then
they are recommended to the respec-
tive committees here, where they again
go through background checks, have
conversations, interviews, public hear-
ings, questions for the record after the
hearings are over, and go through any
followup from any individual American
who wants to give input whether that
input be from outside groups here or
from anywhere else in the country.
Then they come to the floor of the Sen-
ate.
In the past, those individuals moved
through quickly because there were
1,200 of them, but the minority has al-
ways had the right to have one last,
little slowdown when they have gotten
to the floor. They can make what is
called a cloture vote request. The mi-
nority—any individual—could always
make a request for a cloture vote to
say: I know they have gone through all
of these extensive checks, that they
have already passed the committee,
that they have gone through all of the
process, but at the end, I want an addi-
tional 30 hours of debate on these peo-
ple. Yet it is not just 30 hours of de-
bate; it is actually what is called a full
intervening day. After that, there is an
additional 30 hours of debate for that
person.
That has been done in the past but
very rarely in the first 2 years of a
Presidency because there are so many
nominations that have to go through
the process. If we go back to President
Clinton, there were eight of those re-
quests. For President Bush, there were
four of those. For President Obama,
there were 12 of those. For President
Trump, there have been 128 of those.
Two years ago, I saw the trend of
where this was heading. This was a new
structure for the beginning of a Presi-
dency. I was concerned at that time,
but I have an even greater concern
now. It is the trend of where we are
headed as a Senate. Is this going to be
the new normal? This used to be what
was normal: Occasional nominees
would come through if they were very
controversial. Yet most of these nomi-
nees were not really all that controver-
sial. In fact, 48 percent of those nomi-
nees who had the additional cloture
time then got more than 60 votes. In
fact, 37 percent of them got more than
70 votes. These were not controversial
individuals coming through; it was just
an intentional slowing down of the
process.
I have heard folks say: There are so
many of these judges who are coming
through at the district court level that
they become very controversial.
Quite frankly, every single judge who
comes through has to be approved by
the two Senators from that State
through what is called the blue-slip
process. This is for all of those district
court judges. It is a process that has
been honored by previous administra-
tions and by this administration. This
Senate has honored those same blue
slips for all of the district court judges.
If the judges are from a Democratic
State, both of those Democratic Sen-
ators have to approve of them before
they come. If the judges are from a
State that has one Democrat and one
Republican, it has to be split. If there
are two Republicans, they both have to
agree to it. This is for all of the dis-
trict court judges. Yet they are still
being slowed down. They have gone
through the background checks, and
they have been approved by their home
State Senators regardless of party; yet
they are slowed down.
So whether they are executive nomi-
nees or whether they are judicial nomi-
nees, these 128 individuals being slowed
down has created a new slowdown in
the Senate.
Two years ago, I made a proposal to
go back to something that Harry Reid
proposed and was passed by this Senate
in 2013, which was long before I was
here. It was a 2-year agreement to just
say: Here is how we are going to deal
with what is called postcloture debate
time. If there is a controversial nomi-
nee, here is how we will handle it.
I went to my colleagues and said:
Let’s revive that rule. Instead of mak-
ing it for 2 years, which was the Harry
Reid rule, let’s just make it from here
on out. I made that proposal in the last
Senate. We took that to the Rules
Committee. It passed the Rules Com-
mittee, but it could not pass on this
floor.
I thought it was eminently kind and
bipartisan to say that I would go back
and grab Harry Reid’s rule and that if
it was good for the Democrats when
they were in the leadership, it should
be good for everybody regardless of
whether it is the Republicans or the
Democrats. It did not pass.
I have once again come back and
made a proposal to say let’s fix this
and to not just fix this for now but to
fix this from here on out. Whether
there will be a Democratic President or
a Republican President in the future,
let’s have a simple rule: If we get to a
nominee who has gone through the
background checks of the White House,
has gone through the committee and
passed the committee, and has gone
through additional questions for the
record—all of that—if people still want
additional time, they can still request
the intervening day, but then instead
of 30 hours after that full day, it would
be just 2 hours of additional time.
Quite frankly, during most of the
time that we have had the 30 hours of
debate, there hasn’t really been debate
on the floor for 30 hours; there has been
debate on the floor for, say, 15 or 20
minutes. For the rest of the time, the
floor has sat empty or we have debated
other things other than the nominee.
So we would set aside 2 additional
hours. We would do this for district
court judges, and we would do this for
most of the nominees for the executive
branch, but we would still hold that 30
hours for things like nominees for the
circuit court, the Supreme Court, and
those at the Cabinet level. For those
types of positions, sure, keep the 30
hours, but for the other 1,000-plus
nominees who are to be the Deputy
Secretaries or assistants of whatever it
may be, allow them to go through the
normal process and not slow it down.
The Chief Counsel for the IRS has
not been confirmed. He went through
the last Congress, but he didn’t get
there. He passed 25 to 2 out of com-
mittee. He passed 26 to 2 out of com-
mittee this time; yet there is a require-
ment of 30 additional hours of debate
on the floor. He will probably pass
overwhelmingly, but it is just a tactic
to slow down this floor.
We have a lot of business to do. Let’s
make a rule that is fair, and let’s make
it work for everyone. My concern is,
long-term for the Senate, this will be
the new trend, and the next time there
is a Democratic President, this is what
Republicans will do to Democratic
Presidents, and this will be the new
way that we operate.
This isn’t helpful for any President;
this isn’t helpful for the Senate; and
this is something we need to fix.
We have 2 years of muscle memory
on this now—of doing it over and over

and over. I don’t think this gets better
because I think the political pressure
will be there just to keep doing this
and slowing things down for everybody.
So we put a rule out there. It has
gone through the Rules Committee. I
have encouraged my Democratic col-
leagues to join in with this because
there will be a Democratic President
someday in the future, and they will
not want this coming back at them and
will say this is unfair, and I will agree.
But it will happen, so let’s fix it now.
Let’s resolve this in this Senate in this
time from here on out—not a short-
term rule but long-term, permanent—
to take us back to this being the norm,
when we could work better together.
I love hearing everyone say that we
should be more bipartisan as a body. I
would love to get this body working
again. That is this proposal. This pro-
posal is not a partisan proposal. It is
not trying to get leverage on anybody.
It is trying to get this body back to
working again, and I hope in the weeks
ahead, when this rule actually comes
to the floor of the Senate, we can get
overwhelming bipartisan support for it
so that we can get back to working to-
gether.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan.
NOMINATION OF ANDREW R. WHEELER
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I
rise today to speak about a vote that
we will be having in just a few minutes
on the process of moving Andrew
Wheeler forward as the EPA Adminis-
trator.
This is not a time for talk; it is not
time for theoretical debates. This is
certainly not the time for an EPA Ad-
ministrator who, during his time at the
EPA, has ignored climate scientists,
rolled back climate regulations, and
taken action that will lead to more
carbon pollution.
Instead, this is a time for bold, deci-
sive action. We need to act today be-
cause life on our planet depends on it.
The fate of our Nation depends on it.
Our children’s and grandchildren’s fu-
tures depend on it.
For those reasons, I cannot support
Andrew Wheeler for the critical posi-
tion of EPA Administrator.
Climate change is real. In fact, it is
more than real. It is an existential cri-
sis, and it is already having real im-
pact on Michigan families and Michi-
gan’s economy.
Some call it global warming. Kath-
arine Hayhoe, a climate scientist from
Texas Tech, has a better term. She call
calls it ‘‘global weirding.’’ Ask any-
body in Michigan. Things have been
weird.
Our lakes are heating up. In fact,
Lake Superior is getting about 2 de-
grees warmer each decade. That could
make the lake a happy home for
invasive species, like sea lamprey.
As the waters warm, these parasites
grow and kill off more trout and salm-
on and other fish that are key to the
Great Lakes’ $8 billion recreational
fishing industry. It is believed that
warmer temperatures contributed to
algal blooms on the lake last summer.
Other changes we are seeing are life-
threatening.
Thanks to the polar vortex in Janu-
ary, Michigan experienced tempera-
tures colder than Antarctica. Sci-
entists believe that climate change has
caused the jet stream to become
wobbly—that is a technical term,
‘‘wobbly’’—pushing dangerously frigid
air south.
Folks say: Well, how can it be global
warming when we see the polar vortex?
It is about what is happening to desta-
bilize the atmosphere and the planet
and the changes that are occurring.
Last weekend, a bomb cyclone hit my
State, leaving tens of thousands of
Michigan residents without power.
We are having to come up with new
terms. I had never heard of a bomb cy-
clone—60-mile-an-hour winds, ripping
up homes and farms and roadways.
The intensity of what is happening is
incredible. The travel was so treach-
erous in Otsego County that all roads
were closed—all of the roads were
closed. Even drivers on Interstate 75
were getting stuck in drifts. That is
our major highway.
We can’t link any specific storm to
climate change. However, we do know
that overall climate change is making
storms more intense. They are longer.
They are more intense. They are hap-
pening more frequently with more in-
tensity.
Last summer in Houghton County,
more than 51⁄2 inches of rain fell in 6
hours. It caused at least $100 million in
damage to infrastructure, and a 12-
year-old-boy died when the basement of
his home collapsed.
Our climate is changing, but you
don’t have to take my word for it. Just
ask insurance company executives.
Their companies paid out a record $135
billion—billion dollars—from natural
disasters in 2017 alone. That is almost
three times as much as the historic an-
nual average, and their projections
show it getting worse.
We need to take action on climate
change. While it is not widely recog-
nized, I want to speak about something
positive that we have done, and that
was last year’s farm bill.
As you know, the farm bill passed the
Senate with a vote of 87 to 13—the
most votes in history. While the bill
was historic for a number of reasons,
one of those is that it includes the
most ambitious Federal climate-smart
agricultural and forestry policies to
date, working with farmers and ranch-
ers as partners.
It helps farmers implement climate-
smart policies by revamping USDA
conservation programs to prioritize in-
vestments in soil carbon sequestration,
incentivizing the planting of cover
crops, and expanding USDA support for
farmer participation in carbon mar-
kets.
It also invests in the Rural Energy
for America Program, which helps
farmers and rural small businesses in-
stall renewable energy systems and
creates a joint USDA-Department of
Energy education grant program to
drive carbon capture projects across
rural America.
We must also protect forests and
farmland, which serve as vital carbon
sinks that hold carbon rather than re-
leasing it and making the destabiliza-
tion even worse.
The farm bill amends the popular
Healthy Forests Reserve Program to
prioritize carbon sequestration prac-
tices programs and discourage the de-
velopment of forestland. It authorizes
new programs to restore national for-
est landscapes, protect carbon-rich,
old-growth trees, and prevent
uncharacteristic wildfires and their
emissions. It establishes a landmark
soil health demonstration trial to keep
carbon in the ground and promote
healthy and productive farmland.
I am proud of what we did. It was
done with the partnership of farmers
and ranchers, and I have to say that
our farmers understand the importance
of protecting our land—their land—air,
and water, I think, as much as, if not
more than anyone else. No one’s busi-
ness is more impacted by severe and er-
ratic weather than our farmers. They
are caught right in the middle of it,
and I appreciate their working with us
to be part of the solution.
I am also working with my col-
leagues on policies to ensure that the
United States, not China, is the global
leader on advanced transportation
technologies like electric and hydrogen
vehicles.
Meanwhile, Andrew Wheeler and the
Trump administration are upending
fuel economy and carbon regulations in
a way that hurts the auto industry,
consumers, and our environment. We
need to invest more in renewable en-
ergy and the research that is making it
more affordable all the time.
Electric utilities in Michigan have
committed to dramatically increase re-
newable electricity, reduce carbon
emissions by 80 percent, and stop burn-
ing coal.
Meanwhile, Andrew Wheeler and the
Trump administration have rolled back
the historic Clean Power Plan.
I am proud of the fact that Michigan
utilities are moving forward anyway
because they know it is the right thing
and they know what is at stake. But
this administration—Andrew Wheeler—
has rolled back the historic Clean
Power Plan, the Nation’s first regula-
tion of greenhouse gases from the
power sector.
We need to be laser-focused on cli-
mate change and the existential threat
it represents. Meanwhile, Andrew
Wheeler and the Trump administration
are doing their best to pretend that cli-
mate change is no big deal. That is
even as the Pentagon recently con-
cluded that two-thirds of critical mili-
tary installations are threatened—two-
thirds of critical military installations
are threatened—by climate change.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1508 February 27, 2019
Climate change is a big deal, and it is
time to do something about it that is
real—not play political games, but to
actually do something thoughtful and
real about it.
In the wise words of Hank Williams,
Jr., ‘‘We need a little less talk and a
lot more action.’’ Andrew Wheeler has
repeatedly shown no interest in acting.
In fact, he wants to take us backward—
and is taking us backward—on climate
change. He has no interest in reducing,
let alone eliminating, carbon pollution.
We need to act, and it is clear that An-
drew Wheeler is the wrong person to
lead the EPA at this critical time for
our country.
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on Andrew Wheel-
er for EPA Administrator.
NOMINATION OF NEOMI RAO
Mr. President, one other brief com-
ment, as some colleagues will be com-
ing to the floor in a bit, and I want to
join them in speaking about the DC
Circuit Court nominee Neomi Rao. I
stand with them in opposing this nomi-
nation.
In the era of #MeToo, when women
are sharing their stories about assault
and abuse, we don’t need a judge who
has written that women who drink are
to blame if they are then sexually as-
saulted.
We do not need a judge who blocked
a critical equal pay measure intended
to help close the wage gap.
So I join with colleagues in encour-
aging, at the appropriate time, a ‘‘no’’
vote on this nomination.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington.
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that both Senator
MENENDEZ and I be permitted to speak
for up to 5 minutes each prior to the
roll call vote on the Desmond nomina-
tion.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am
delighted to join the Senator from
Michigan today, to add to her com-
ments about the replacement for now-
Justice Kavanaugh after he was con-
firmed to the Supreme Court last year,
and I want to remind my colleagues
about the people who spoke up during
Justice Kavanaugh’s nomination and
the critical issues that they spoke
about.
Women stood up. They rallied. They
marched. They made clear they do not
want to go back to the days before the
Roe v. Wade decision affirmed their
right to make their own healthcare de-
cisions.
Incredibly brave survivors, such as
Dr. Ford and so many others, said they
wanted to be heard and believed, not si-
lenced.
Families across the country said
they wanted a Justice who would inter-
pret the law fairly and objectively,
without partisanship—someone whose
priority is the Constitution and people
across the country, not President
Trump and his extreme agenda.
Unfortunately, but not surprisingly,
it is clear that President Trump and
Republicans in Congress aren’t listen-
ing to women or survivors or families,
because the next nominee for the DC
Circuit Court fails on each and every
count I just listed.
As we speak, Neomi Rao is enacting
the Trump agenda in her role as the
head of the Agency that reviews and
approves the Trump administration’s
changes to regulations impacting so
many people in communities who stood
up to oppose Justice Kavanaugh’s nom-
ination.
Under Ms. Rao’s leadership, the
Trump administration finalized a rule
that prevents healthcare providers
from even informing patients who
come to title X-funded health centers
about where to go to get safe—safe—
legal abortions and places new, burden-
some, medically unnecessary require-
ments on title X-funded health centers,
designed specifically to prevent
Planned Parenthood from receiving
these funds, meaning millions of pa-
tients may lose a source of quality, af-
fordable, basic healthcare they trust.
Ms. Rao has helped put forward rules
that would make it harder for members
of the LGBTQ community and women
to get the care they need by allowing
providers to turn them away simply be-
cause of who they are or because they
want birth control.
I also want to take a few minutes to
address Ms. Rao’s deeply concerning
comments about rape and sexual as-
sault. While in college, she wrote that
‘‘a good way to avoid a potential date
rape is to stay reasonably sober.’’
Let’s be clear. It is never a survivor’s
fault, ever, that someone raped or sex-
ually assaulted them.
Ms. Rao was given an opportunity to
explicitly reject those comments and
failed to do so. She then sent a letter
attempting to walk them back, but her
actions speak louder than a letter sent
during a nomination process, and her
actions on this issue have been harm-
ful.
In her role within the Trump admin-
istration, Ms. Rao has helped Secretary
DeVos to roll back protections that
help survivors get justice when they
are sexually assaulted on campuses. In
other words, at the same time that Ms.
Rao claims her views have changed on
sexual assault and consent, her actions
are aligned with those who believe
what she wrote in college. To the sur-
vivors I hear from and those who
bravely spoke out against Justice
Kavanaugh and so many others, Ms.
Rao’s actions are what matters.
Ms. Rao is also listening to corporate
lobbyists instead of scientists when it
comes to climate and our public health
and is advancing rules that would
allow more discrimination in our Na-
tion’s housing programs. Unfortu-
nately, it seems that on many issues,
where President Trump wants to do
damage and hurt families, Ms. Rao is
right behind him with a rubberstamp,
just like Justice Kavanaugh and so
many others President Trump has
nominated to the bench.
We need judges who will do what
workers and families expect of a
judge—to interpret our laws according
to the Constitution and what is best for
our country, not according to politics
and what is best for President Trump.
That is why I am strongly opposing her
nomination, and I hope all of our col-
leagues will join us in doing so.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey.
NOMINATION OF MICHAEL J. DESMOND
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I
rise today in opposition to President
Trump’s nominee for Chief Counsel of
the Internal Revenue Service, Michael
Desmond.
This nominee comes before us just a
week into this year’s filing season,
when our need for an IRS that treats
all taxpayers fairly is clearer than
ever.
Already, thousands of taxpayers
across America are grappling with the
fallout of the Trump tax bill and its
capping of the State and local tax, or
SALT, deduction. Already, the IRS has
reported an average 17 percent drop in
the size of tax refunds this year. Al-
ready, the broken promises made by
President Trump and his Republican
allies are being laid bare.
They promised middle-class families
thousands of dollars of tax relief and a
$4,000 raise in their salaries. Instead,
they got $1.5 trillion in more debt and
an economy that is even more rigged
for big corporations and wealthy CEOs.
As bad as the Trump tax scam is for
the whole country, it is worse for New
Jersey families. That is because Repub-
licans paid for a big chunk of their cor-
porate giveaways by gutting the State
and local tax deduction that New Jer-
sey and other States’ middle-class fam-
ilies depend on to write off their prop-
erty taxes. In 2016, 1.8 million people—
about 40 percent of New Jersey tax-
payers—deducted their property and
State income taxes. More than 80 per-
cent of them earned less than $200,000,
and the average deduction totaled
$18,000—far above the arbitrary cap im-
posed by the Trump tax bill.
With tax season under way, many
homeowners are just now realizing how
badly their President ripped them off.
To add insult to injury, the IRS issued
haphazard guidance for the Trump tax
bill that unfairly targets States like
New Jersey, trying to simply lessen the
burden heaped on them by the GOP.
In the final days of 2017, just days
after President Trump signed the tax
bill, New Jerseyans rushed to prepay
their 2018 local property taxes and pre-
serve their deductions before the new
cap on the SALT deductions took ef-
fect. But then came Trump’s IRS,
which issued guidance to try to limit
their ability to deduct property tax
payments made in 2017 on their Federal
returns—a stunning backdoor attempt
to retroactively apply the cap on prop-
erty tax deductions without cleared
legislative tax to warrant doing so.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1509
February 27, 2019
Months later, the IRS again changed
the rules on us by attacking New Jer-
sey’s new charitable deduction tax
credit program. The IRS never had a
problem when 32 other States offered
tax credits for charitable donations.
Only when New Jersey and other simi-
larly situated States created a similar
program did the IRS decide to change
the rules.
Mr. Desmond would be the Chief
Counsel of the IRS, the position di-
rectly overseeing the IRS’s interpreta-
tion of these rule changes. Throughout
his nomination, I was given no indica-
tion that Mr. Desmond would give fair
treatment on these important issues
affecting New Jersey and other States.
The full deductibility of State and
local taxes has been a bedrock prin-
ciple of our Tax Code since the income
tax’s creation in 1913, and that concept
stretches all the way back to Alex-
ander Hamilton’s writings about the
autonomy of States under the U.S.
Constitution.
This commonsense policy allows
States to invest in things like public
safety, education, and infrastructure—
the very things that make New Jersey
a great place to live, work, and raise a
family.
Make no mistake, the property tax
deduction isn’t just important for
homeowners. It matters to all New Jer-
sey families. It is why our public
schools rank among the best in the Na-
tion. It is why Save the Children
named us the No. 1 State in America to
raise a child. I want it to stay that
way.
We must protect the investments
that make New Jersey a place where
families thrive. That is why last month
I introduced bipartisan legislation to
fully restore the State and local tax de-
duction. It is called the SALT Act,
which stands for ‘‘Stop the Attack on
Local Taxpayers.’’ It is no secret that
in New Jersey and in many of the Na-
tion’s most economically productive
States, families face high property tax
bills and a higher cost of living. Our
bill is designed to provide some relief.
Simply put, the more you pay in prop-
erty and State taxes, the more relief
you get from our bill, and we help pay
for it by repealing some of Trump’s
most unnecessary tax breaks for the
superwealthy. It is the exact opposite
of what the Trump tax bill says, which
is, basically that the higher the cost of
living is in your State, the more you
pay in State and local taxes and the
more you will owe to the Federal Gov-
ernment. That makes no sense.
Make no mistake, President Trump
and his administration and the IRS
have it out for States like New Jersey.
Mr. Desmond would be the arbiter of
how the IRS would interpret important
tax issues affecting these States. That
is why I oppose his nomination.
I yield back my time.

the previous order, all postcloture time

The PRESIDING OFFICER. There

ly divided, prior to the cloture vote.
The Senator from Wyoming.
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, it is
time to vote on the nomination of An-
drew Wheeler to be the Administrator
of the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy.
For the past year, Andrew Wheeler
has served as the Senate-confirmed
Deputy Administrator of the EPA, and
for the past 7 months, he has served as
the Acting Administrator. He has done
an admirable job in charge of the EPA.
Under his leadership, the EPA has
put forward commonsense proposals to
roll back punishing regulations and
still protect America’s air and water.
He is committed to protecting both
human health and the environment.
Andrew Wheeler’s qualifications are
without question. He has spent decades
working in environmental policy at the
EPA itself, here on Capitol Hill, and as
a consultant to environmental and en-
ergy clients.
President Trump picked the right
person to lead the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency when he nominated An-
drew Wheeler. It is time for the Senate
to confirm him to this important post.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware.
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise in
opposition to the nomination of An-
drew Wheeler as the Administrator of
the EPA. Under the provisions of the
Federal Vacancies Act, Mr. Wheeler
can continue to lead the EPA until Au-
gust 7 of this year.
Rushing to judgment on his nomina-
tion will close the window of oppor-
tunity the Senate has now to ensure
that he reverses course on a handful of
important policies that protect our
planet while creating American jobs.
I am not calling for delay for delay’s
sake. We have 161 days to ensure that
Mr. Wheeler withdraws his proposal to
put the mercury and air toxics stand-
ards rule in legal jeopardy. We have 161
days to hear him say that he supports
Senate ratification of a treaty that
phases out harmful HFCs while cre-
ating jobs. We have 161 days to ensure
that he negotiates with a coalition, in-
cluding California and 12 other States,
on vehicle fuel efficiency standards and
greenhouse gas emissions while giving
the auto industry the certainty they
need.
While progress is being made on
these important issues, I am asking my
colleagues to vote no today on cloture
on the motion to proceed to this nomi-
nation.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, after
careful consideration, I have decided to
oppose the confirmation of Andrew
Wheeler, the nominee for Adminis-
trator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, EPA.
While Mr. Wheeler is certainly quali-
fied for this position, I have too many
concerns with the actions he has taken
during his tenure as Acting Adminis-
trator to be able to support his pro-
motion. I believe that Mr. Wheeler, un-
like Scott Pruitt, understands the mis-
sion of the EPA and acts in accordance
with ethical standards; however, the
policies he has supported as Acting Ad-
ministrator are not in the best interest
of our environment and public health,
particularly given the threat of cli-
mate change to our Nation.
I met at length with Mr. Wheeler,
and we discussed many important envi-
ronmental issues about which I care

deeply, from EPA’s enforcement of
landmark environmental laws to green-
house gas emissions and mercury pollu-
tion. Since last August, the EPA has
proposed to roll back environmental
protections, including determining it is
no longer ‘‘appropriate and necessary’’
to regulate mercury emissions from
power plants, halting efforts to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions from cars
and trucks, and replacing the Clean
Power Plan.
These efforts are of great importance
to the State of Maine, which is located
at the end of our Nation’s ‘‘air pollu-
tion tailpipe’’ and is on the receiving
end of pollution generated by coal-fired
power plants in other States. More-
over, there is no doubt that the green-
house gas emissions driving climate
change pose a significant threat to our
State’s economy and our natural re-
sources, from our working forests, fish-
ing, and agricultural industries, to
tourism, and recreation.
Reducing harmful air pollutants is
critical for public health, particularly
for Maine, which has among the high-
est rates of asthma in the country. In
Maine, cars, trucks, and other vehicles
produce more than 50 percent of our
State’s greenhouse gas emissions. Con-
trols for mercury, one of the most per-
sistent and dangerous pollutants, are
especially important for children and
pregnant women. The Agency’s recent
efforts to halt progress in these critical
areas takes us in the wrong direction.
In keeping with my past practice, I
will vote to allow the full Senate to
consider Mr. Wheeler’s nomination so
that every Senator can have a clear up
or down vote on this important nomi-
nation of a member of the President’s
Cabinet.
However, due to the actions Mr.
Wheeler has taken during his tenure at
the EPA, I will vote against his con-
firmation.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The

read the nomination of Andrew Wheel-
er, of Virginia, to be Administrator of
the Environmental Protection Agency.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware.
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise to
speak this afternoon about the nomina-
tion of Andrew Wheeler to become Ad-
ministrator of the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency.
The day after Mr. Wheeler was named
EPA Acting Administrator, I wrote
him a letter. I reminded Mr. Wheeler of
the opportunity he had to try a new
course for that Agency after Scott Pru-
itt’s scandal-plagued administration.
Yet in the 7 months as Acting Adminis-
trator, unfortunately, Mr. Wheeler has
so far chosen not to reverse course at
EPA in too many important instances.
In some cases, he has even accelerated
the environmental damage and regu-
latory zeal that his predecessor began.
I knew that Mr. Wheeler and I would
not always agree on every issue, but
like so many others, I did hope that he
would moderate some of Scott Pruitt’s
most egregious and environmentally
destructive policies, specifically on
policies where industry and the envi-
ronmental community are in broad
agreement. Sadly, my hopes have not
been realized.
To be clear, Mr. Wheeler is not the
ethically bereft embarrassment that
Scott Pruitt was. Mr. Wheeler has also
engaged more frequently and sub-
stantively than Scott Pruitt did with
both Congress and EPA career staff,
but time and again, Mr. Wheeler has
proven that his environmental policies
are almost as destructive and extreme
as his predecessor’s, despite the ex-
plicit promises Mr. Wheeler has made
to Members of Congress, both in pri-
vate and in public meetings.
One of those promises was Mr. Wheel-
er’s recent insistence that, when it
comes to getting a deal on vehicle fuel
economy and greenhouse gas standards
with California and a coalition of 12
other States, including my State and
the Presiding Officer’s State, ‘‘no one
wants a 50-State deal more than I do.’’
That was Mr. Wheeler’s promise during
his nomination hearing in front of the
Environment and Public Works Com-
mittee in January.
Just weeks later, the headlines told a
different story. For months, Mr. Wheel-
er said repeatedly that he shared my
goal of striking a deal—not just my
goal, but the goal of many of us here—
with the State of California and a
dozen of other States on fuel economy
and greenhouse gas emissions stand-
ards. Not long after he became Acting
Administrator, however, Mr. Wheeler
signed off on the Trump administra-
tion’s proposal that freezes the stand-
ards for the better part of a decade,
eliminates most of the air condi-
tioning, electric vehicle, and other
compliance credits that are supported
by chemical companies, automobile
and parts manufacturers, and utilities
and preempts California’s authority to
set its own stronger standards.
What is more, the Trump administra-
tion reportedly plans to penalize rules
that call for a 0.5-percent increase.
That is a one-half of 1-percent increase
in the stringency of those standards—
one-tenth the pace called for in the
rules that are already on the books.
Since that proposal was put forth,
the entire automobile industry, many
Members of Congress, and many other
stakeholders have repeatedly asked the
EPA to forge a compromise that avoids
years of costly litigation and uncer-
tainty for our automobile industry. So
far, that is all for naught.
Just last week, unfortunately and
inexplicably, EPA announced, with the

February 27, 2019
White House and the Department of
Transportation, that they decided to
end their so-called negotiations with
the State of California and, effectively,
with 12 other States. These negotia-
tions were superficial, at best, or
duplicitous and designed to fail, at
worst. Between you and me, I don’t see
how these discussions could have ended
or failed because they never seriously
began in the first place. It is out-
rageous.
That brings me back to Mr. Wheeler’s
promise. After his emphatic insistence
that he wanted to find a 50-State solu-
tion for these standards, the decision
to end them without ever making a se-
rious effort to ever reach a compromise
sends a clear message that, sadly, Mr.
Wheeler—at least, in this instance—is
unable to keep his word. I say that
with no joy, but I say it nonetheless.
A second example of Mr. Wheeler’s
failure to lead in an appropriate way
lies in his unreasonable opposition to
submitting to the Senate for ratifica-
tion something called a the ‘‘Kigali
Amendment’’ to the Montreal Pro-
tocol.
I mentioned this to one of our col-
leagues. He said: Talk to me in

I reminded him that we used to use
something called CFCs. It was a refrig-
erator coolant that was broadly used in
this country until we found out it had
very serious consequences for our
ozone layer. Science, chemical compa-
nies, and chemists came up with a re-
placement to CFCs. We call them
HFCs, or hydrofluorocarbons, which
are better for the ozone. They are still
destructive to the greenhouse gas and
destructive to our planet. Well, guess
what. Scientists and chemists have,
again, come up with a follow-on prod-
uct to HFCs. It is not scientists and
chemists in companies in other coun-
tries. They are right here in America.
They have invested in a lot of money
to come up with this discovery, this in-
vention. They want to sell it. That re-
quires the phaseout over time of HFCs.
We need the Kigali Amendment to be
submitted to the Senate for ratifica-
tion in order to open the door for our
American companies to compete with a
new technology that is good for jobs in
America and good for our planet. Our
country could gain 150,000 direct and
indirect new jobs, and almost $40 bil-
lion in annual economic benefits by
2027 because the safer substitutes to
HFCs are made in Texas and Louisiana.
These are good-paying jobs. These are
green manufacturing jobs that could
help our efforts to address climate
change while bolstering our country’s
economy.
Ratification of this treaty is sup-
ported by an extraordinary list of
stakeholders, including more than a
dozen of our Republican colleagues
here in this Chamber. From the Amer-
ican Chemistry Council to the Chamber
of Commerce, to FreedomWorks, to the
Sierra Club, it seems that just about
everyone supports ratification of this
amendment, as best I can tell—every-
one, that is, except EPA.
Under Mr. Wheeler’s leadership, EPA
also decided it is no longer ‘‘appro-
priate and necessary’’ to protect ba-
bies’ brains from mercury and air toxic
pollution emitted by electric utilities.
In the eleventh hour before the gov-
ernment shutdown, Mr. Wheeler signed
a proposal that guts the legal founda-
tion of the mercury and air toxics
standards, also known as the MATS
rule. Using outdated data and deciding
that some benefits—like reduction in
cancer, birth defects, and asthma at-
tacks—are no longer important for the
Agency to count, EPA is now setting a
dangerous precedent and putting the
mercury and air toxics standards rule
in legal jeopardy. In fact, EPA has
gone so far as to request public com-
ment on whether the standards should
be eliminated altogether.
Mr. Wheeler says that this action
was necessary and that the proposal
strikes a balance. That is just not true.
In fact, the utility industry is in full
compliance with these standards al-
ready, and they have done so at a third
of the expected costs. That is why
every stakeholder—from coal-fired
utilities that comply with the rules to
religious leaders, to environmental or-
ganizations, to the Chamber of Com-
merce—urged this administration not
to take this step. In fact, utility groups
and organized labor organizations
wrote to EPA saying:
The industry already has invested signifi-
cant capital—estimated at more than $18 bil-
lion—in addition to these operating costs,
and states are relying on the operation of
these controls for their air quality plans.
Therefore, we—
This being the group that wrote to
EPA, including utility groups and or-
ganized labor groups—
urge EPA to . . . leave the underlying MATS
rule in place and effective.
Yet Mr. Wheeler has chosen to ignore
the chorus of stakeholders who all
hoped he would chart a more respon-
sible path—on this front, too—even
though utilities are not asking for this
action that he is taking and the EPA is
taking, and the courts are not requir-
ing it.
Yet, from the stakeholders, from the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the
utility industry over here to all of the
NGOs and environmental groups and
health groups over here, everybody
says to leave this rule alone. It was
adopted 7 years ago, and it works. It
has worked at half the cost or at one-
third of the cost. Leave it alone. I just
don’t get this. This is just another ex-
ample of when Mr. Wheeler has taken a
recklessly and unnecessary extreme
course of action at the EPA.
Here is another one.
In May of 2018, after meeting with a
victim’s mother, Scott Pruitt, the
former EPA Administrator, announced
plans to finalize the Obama adminis-
tration’s ban to prohibit consumer and
commercial paint stripping uses for
something called methylene chloride—
a hazardous chemical that has killed
dozens of unsuspecting users in this
country alone.
Despite explicit assurances provided
to my office and others that the EPA
would follow through with Mr. Pruitt’s
promise to protect both consumer and
commercial users from methylene
chloride, under Mr. Wheeler’s leader-
ship, the EPA sent a final rule restrict-
ing only the consumer uses of meth-
ylene chloride to the White House’s Of-
fice of Management and Budget. There
have been 56 accidental exposure
deaths related to methylene chloride
since 1980—56—including properly
trained workers who have worn protec-
tive gear on the job. Yet the EPA,
under Mr. Wheeler’s leadership, has de-
cided to exempt workers from the
methylene chloride ban.
A number of people have said to me
they think it is unconscionable. I think
they are right. With Mr. Wheeler at the
helm, the EPA cannot even manage to
ban a chemical that is so harmful to
human health that stores—and this in-
cludes Walmart, Sherwin-Williams,
Ace Hardware, Home Depot, and oth-
ers—have already voluntarily taken it
off their shelves.
That is not all. Even the EPA’s re-
cently announced PFAS Action Plan,
which was released with much fanfare 2
weeks ago, did not do much more than
renounce the same measures an-
nounced by Scott Pruitt almost a year
ago. PFAS is sometimes referred to as
forever chemicals. The reason, my col-
leagues, is that they last forever in our
environment. It took a public outcry to
make Mr. Wheeler reverse the Agency’s
inexplicable decision not to set an en-
forceable drinking water standard for
PFAS. At his hearing last month, I
asked him if he would agree to set a
clean drinking water standard in 2
years—not in 2 weeks, not in 2 months
but in 2 years—and he could not do
that.
In short, over the past 7 months as
the Acting Administrator, Mr. Wheeler
has perpetuated and in at least one in-
stance I have cited here today has
worsened the preexisting inadequacies
and failures Scott Pruitt left behind.
When faced with opportunities to pro-
tect human health and the environ-
ment in ways that also have the sup-
port of the industries that would be
regulated, time and again, Mr. Wheeler
has failed to act in a way that I believe
is responsible and has, instead, listened
to some of the most extreme voices
around him.
As I have said before and will say
again, I am not making some futile at-
tempt at changing the hearts and
minds about this nominee at the elev-
enth hour. I am not that kind of Sen-
ator and never have been, and I was not
that kind of Governor. I am not
grandstanding, trying to get any press
attention, or the perfect sound bite. I
am, however, trying to convince some
of my colleagues to seize this window
of opportunity we have now to ensure
that Acting Administrator Wheeler re-
verses course and governs responsibly

at the EPA. That is what I am trying
to do. That is what we are trying to do.
As the President’s nominee to lead
this Agency, under the provisions of
the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, Mr.
Wheeler can continue to lead the EPA
as Acting Administrator until August 7
of this year. He is there, and he is
going to be there. Rushing to judgment
on this nomination will close the win-
dow of opportunity we have to ensure
the Acting Administrator reverses
course at the EPA and embraces the
commonsense, bipartisan policies I just
laid out—policies which make our envi-
ronment cleaner and safer while they
also create jobs and strengthen Amer-
ica’s economy. I think we all want
that. I think that is why people sent us
here to negotiate those kind of win-win
agreements.
I urge my colleagues to join me in
voting no on this nomination so we can
achieve those win-win situations that
are there for the taking.
I thank the Presiding Officer.
I reserve the balance of my time.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming.
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, the
Senate is today considering the nomi-
nation of Andrew Wheeler to serve as
the Administrator of the Environ-
mental Protection Agency. It is the job
of the EPA to protect both the environ-
ment and human health. This critically
important Agency needs Senate-con-
firmed leadership in place.
President Trump picked the right
person to lead this Agency when he
nominated Andrew Wheeler. Since
April of last year, he has served as the
Deputy Administrator of the Environ-
mental Protection Agency, and since
July of last year, he has served as the
Acting Administrator of the Agency. I
believe Andrew Wheeler has done an
outstanding job in leading the EPA
over the past 7 months.
During the last administration, the
EPA issued punishing regulations that
would hurt the economy and raise
costs on families. Under Acting Admin-
istrator Wheeler’s leadership, the EPA
has taken a different approach. The
Agency is now putting forward pro-
posals that both protect our environ-
ment and allow the country’s economy
to flourish.
Acting Administrator Wheeler has
led efforts to issue commonsense regu-
latory proposals. These include the af-
fordable clean energy rule and revising
the definition of the waters of the
United States. Both of these proposals
show Mr. Wheeler is serious about
clean air and clean water while they
also show he understands there is an
important role for States and local
communities to play. It can’t be a top-
down, Washington-knows-best ap-
proach.
Acting Administrator Wheeler has
played a critical role in implementing
updates to the Toxic Substances Con-
trol Act and has taken steps to limit
people’s exposure to dangerous and
toxic chemicals. These updates are the
result of major bipartisan legislation
that came out of the Senate Environ-
ment and Public Works Committee in
2016.
Andrew Wheeler is working to limit
lead exposure as well. Last December,
he helped to unveil the Trump adminis-
tration’s multiagency effort to reduce
the number of children exposed to lead
in drinking water, in consumer prod-
ucts, and in paint. During his tenure,
the EPA has also worked to provide
greater regulatory certainty to States,
to Tribes, to communities, and to the
industries it regulates.
Mr. Wheeler is well qualified for the
position of EPA Administrator. He has
spent decades—actually, over 25
years—working in environmental pol-
icy. He has served as a career employee
at the EPA as an environmental pro-
tection specialist. This experience
makes him uniquely qualified to serve
as the head of the Agency.
After that time, he spent over a dec-
ade here on Capitol Hill. When he left
the EPA, he came here to work on the
Environment and Public Works Com-
mittee. He served as the staff director
of the Senate Environment and Public
Works’ Clean Air and Nuclear Safety
Subcommittee for 6 years. Then he
spent another 6 years working as the
Republican staff director and chief
counsel for the full committee under
Chairman JIM INHOFE. After his time
on the Hill, he also worked as a con-
sultant for a variety of energy and en-
vironmental clients. He is very well
qualified, and that is a big reason his
nomination has received broad support.
There are 63 agricultural and forestry
groups that wrote a letter in support of
Mr. Wheeler’s nomination to be the Ad-
ministrator: ‘‘It is hard to imagine a
more qualified individual for the role
of EPA administrator, and we respect-
fully request that the committee move
to confirm his nomination so that he
may be considered by the full Senate,’’
they say, ‘‘at the earliest date pos-
sible.’’
Mr. Wheeler has received praise from
the United Mine Workers of America.
Cecil Roberts, the union’s inter-
national president, said the following
about Mr. Wheeler: ‘‘[H]e will be a rea-
sonable voice within the agency, and
will recognize the impact on both the
workers and mining communities that
are directly affected as EPA develops
future emissions regulations.’’
His experience and commitment to
sound environmental policies has re-
ceived recognition from the Democrats
as well.
Senator CARPER, who is with me on
the floor and was the ranking member
of our committee at one point, said of
Mr. Wheeler when he was nominated
for the Deputy Administrator’s role: ‘‘I
think having worked in the agency, he
actually cares about the environment;
the air we breathe; the water we drink;
the planet on which we live.’’ I agree.
It is time to end the needless delays
by the Senate Democrats. Andrew
Wheeler’s nomination to serve as the
Deputy Administrator was delayed for
months and had to be reported out of
the EPW Committee twice before he
was confirmed. Now the Senate Demo-
crats are calling to delay the process
again. These delays only slow down the
Agency from meeting its objectives of
helping communities and protecting
the environment.
The EPA needs a Senate-confirmed
Administrator in office. The EPA Ad-
ministrator plays a central role in de-
veloping and implementing programs
that are focused on meeting the EPA’s
mission of protecting human health
and the environment. Andrew Wheeler
is well qualified to lead this Agency
and to serve in the President’s Cabinet.
He is the right person to be the Admin-
istrator of the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency, and I strongly encourage
every Senator to support the nomina-
tion.
NOMINATION OF JOHN L. RYDER
Mr. President, I also rise in support
of the nomination of John L. Ryder to
serve as a member of the Board of Di-
rectors of the Tennessee Valley Au-
thority, the TVA.
The TVA serves 9 million people in
parts of seven Southeastern States. It
provides affordable electricity for busi-
ness customers and local power compa-
nies, for flood control, navigation, and
land management for the Tennessee
River system, plus economic develop-
ment for the region. The TVA is cred-
ited with transforming the region into
a growing population and a growing
economic base.
With over 40 years of experience as a
lawyer, Mr. Ryder will be a strong
complement to the TVA’s Board of Di-
rectors. The Environment and Public
Works Committee attested to this fact
when it reported his nomination favor-
ably to the Senate by a voice vote
twice—first, on May 22, 2018, during the
115th Congress, and the next on Feb-
ruary 5 of this year after he had to be
renominated during this Congress be-
cause of the delays in the nomination
approval process last year. Mr. Ryder
is another example of how the con-
firmation process has deliberately run
aground. Mr. Ryder, in normal times,
would have been confirmed and in of-
fice last summer. Instead, we have to
go through a cloture vote on a well-
qualified nominee who has twice been
reported unanimously through the En-
vironment and Public Works Com-
mittee.
Let’s not delay this any longer. I
urge my colleagues to vote with me in
supporting the nomination of John L.
Ryder to be a member of the Board of
Directors of the Tennessee Valley Au-
thority.
I thank the Presiding Officer.
I yield the floor.

ator from Connecticut.
BIPARTISAN BACKGROUND CHECKS BILL
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, later
today, the House of Representatives
will pass a proposal that will be sup-
ported by 95, 97 percent of Americans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1513
February 27, 2019
This is a proposal to make sure any-
body in this country who wants to buy
a gun in a legitimate transaction has
to go through a background check—a
background check that in 90 percent of
the cases takes less than 5 minutes of
time. That background check will as-
sure that only people who should be
buying guns and owning guns will be
buying and owning guns—people who
don’t have violent criminal histories
and people who don’t have histories of
serious mental illness. It is a popular
proposal. It is an impactful proposal. It
will save thousands of lives all across
this country.
I have come down to the floor to just
remind my colleagues as to why this is
so important, and I want to tell a
quick story to try to put a little meat
on the bone when it comes to this con-
versation we are having about the im-
portance of making sure people go
through background checks before they
buy weapons.
Mr. President, 2008 to 2012 was a pe-
riod of time in this country’s history
where violence was declining. Homi-
cides were declining. Gun murders were
declining. They were declining across
the country. Specifically during that
period of time, they were declining in
the Midwest. Yet there was one State
that stood out as a curious outlier dur-
ing that period of time, and that was
the State of Missouri.
In the State of Missouri, there was a
dramatic jump during this period of
time in gun homicides. In fact, it hap-
pened right away after 2007. In 2008 and
2009, about 50 to 60 to 70 additional peo-
ple every year were being murdered
with guns inside Missouri. A researcher
from Johns Hopkins went to try to fig-
ure out why this was, and I think it is
important to tell that story on the
floor today.
Let me give a little historical con-
text first. During the Civil War, Mis-
souri was one of the most violent, most
dangerous places in the country be-
cause there were these outlaws, these
renegades of Confederates who were
out in the bush—they call them the
bushwhackers—who were doing regular
battle with Union troops. It was one of
the first instances of true, sustained
guerilla warfare in this Nation. When
the Civil War was over, they didn’t go
home. They had been brutally put
down by the Union, but they stuck, and
they formed their own smaller crimi-
nal enterprises.
We know about this because Jesse
James and his brother Frank were
amongst those who made their name as
bushwhackers fighting the Union and
then turned into criminals who robbed
stage coaches and banks and trains.
To combat this post-Civil War con-
tinuation of violence, Missouri decided
to change its firearms laws, and it
started with a crackdown on the abil-
ity of individuals to conceal weapons.
It extended to a change in the Con-
stitution to make it perfectly clear
that Missouri politicians had the abil-
ity to limit who could own guns and
who couldn’t.
Eventually, a provision got passed
that said that in order to own a hand-
gun, you had to get a permit from your
local authority. As time went on, that
permit came to include a background
check, so that if you wanted to own a
gun in Missouri, you had to go and get
a background check. You had to prove
you did not have a serious criminal his-
tory or a serious history of mental ill-
ness.
What happened in 2007 was that, very
quietly, that provision got repealed. It
was part of a much louder effort to re-
peal a whole host of gun laws in Mis-
souri. Missouri kind of became the epi-
center of the NRA’s focus in the 2000s.
It was this Southern—semi-Southern
State that still had pretty tough gun
laws, and the NRA went all in and had
their annual convention in St. Louis
and spent millions of dollars trying to
elect folks who would sign laws they
were pushing through the legislature.
In 2007, they finally got their way.
They got all these laws that had been
passed since the Civil War repealed.
One of them was the law that required
you to get a background check before
you could buy a gun.
The researcher from Johns Hopkins
sort of looked at all these laws, con-
trolled for all sorts of other factors,
and came to the conclusion—you
should read the paper; it is very well
done—that it was this provision which
removed the background check that led
to this dramatic spike in violence. He
has all sorts of interesting data to
show why that is. All the other violent
crime in Missouri stayed flat from 2008
to 2012, but gun crimes spiked. All of a
sudden, guns bought in Missouri were
being used in crimes all over the re-
gion. Other States started to report an
increase—a curious, sudden increase—
in crime guns that were bought in Mis-
souri. Well, guess why. It was because
all of a sudden, you didn’t have to get
a background check if you wanted to
buy a gun in Missouri. All of a sudden,
criminals and people with serious men-
tal illnesses could get guns through
gun shows and internet sales—trans-
actions on the private market—with-
out that background check.
I tell this story because I hear oppo-
nents of this bill in the House saying:
This isn’t meaningful. It won’t work.
These mass shootings weren’t perpet-
uated with weapons that were bought
without background checks.
Well, that is true. This one public
policy intervention won’t stop every
single bad thing that happens in this
country. But the data is the data, and
it shows us that States that have back-
ground checks have dramatically lower
rates of gun crime than States that
don’t have them.
A little bit earlier than the changes
made in Missouri, my State of Con-
necticut made the opposite change. My
State of Connecticut made a change to
go from being a non-background check
State to a background check State. We
put in a local permit that came with a
background check requirement. So
even if you bought your gun outside of
a bricks-and-mortar gun store, you had
to get a permit, and that permit re-
quired you to get a background check.
Well, that same researcher went to
Connecticut, ran all the numbers, and
found out that in Connecticut, after
that change was made, gun murders
dropped by 40 percent. They increased
in Missouri by about 25 percent and de-
creased in Connecticut by about 40 per-
cent—and again controlling for all
sorts of other factors that could ex-
plain those changes.
So on both sides of the ledger, there
is what I would tell you is incon-
trovertible evidence that a State that
has background checks is going to end
up having many fewer gun crimes than
a State that doesn’t have them. The
problem is, as we saw in and around
Missouri, guns don’t respect borders, so
when Missouri dropped its gun back-
ground check requirement, those guns
started moving into other States.
That is what happened in my State.
The guns that are used to commit
crimes in our cities—the guns that are
trafficked out of the back of vans—
aren’t bought from Connecticut gun
stores; they are bought by criminals in
other States because they know they
can go to gun shows and they can turn
to internet sales in those other States
and buy those weapons.
The same thing happens as weapons
move across our border. I have heard
an awful lot from this President about
how dangerous Mexico and Central
America are. Well, there is some truth
to that, but the guns that are being
used in those crimes are trafficked
from the United States of America, and
the way they get to the southern bor-
der is through States that don’t have
background check requirements.
Just go online and check out what
people say who have been arrested for
gun trafficking. They tell you exactly
how they did it. They go to gun shows
in Texas. They buy guns at unregu-
lated gun shows in Texas, and they
take them back across the border and
sell them in Central America.
So we have all the evidence we need—
empirical evidence, anecdotal evi-
dence—to pass this piece of legislation,
but maybe the most important reason
that we should pass it, that we should
take it up here in the Senate when it
passes the House later today, is that it
is just so darn popular. There really
isn’t anything else in America today
that is as popular as universal back-
ground checks. The minimum score is
about 90 percent. There is plenty of
really good polling that says that 97
percent of Americans support universal
background checks. Grandma isn’t that
popular. Apple pie isn’t that popular.
There is nothing we debate here that
gets 97 percent on agreement other
than the issue of background checks.
So I am here on the floor today to try
to fill in some of the details on why
this is so important and to implore my
colleagues, once it passes the House of
Representatives, to bring it here. Obvi-
ously, I would love to have a vote on

S1514 February 27, 2019
the House bill, but I understand how
this place works. We are going to send
a letter to Chairman GRAHAM asking
him to at the very least convene a
hearing on background checks in the
Judiciary Committee.
We came to a conclusion here in the
Senate as to a bipartisan background
checks proposal that could get 50
votes—in 2013—and I would love to
start that process again. But there is
no reason not to do it because all the
evidence tells us that when we make
sure that only the right people buy
guns, a lot less people die from gun
crimes.
This is not controversial anywhere
except for Washington, DC. Everybody
out there in the American public wants
us to pass universal background
checks. Maybe some other interven-
tions in this space are a little bit more
controversial, split folks a little bit
more, but not background checks. This
thing is decided outside of the Senate
Chamber and the House Chamber. Pop-
ular in the public, deeply impactful,
will save thousands of lives—that is a
triple we don’t get very often here, and
we should take advantage of the oppor-
tunity.
Let me leave you with this: I con-
vened a panel a couple of nights ago to
talk about the importance of back-
ground checks, and there were a num-
ber of parents of those who were lost to
gun violence. One of the parents was
from Sandy Hook. Another was a par-
ent of a child who was killed in Chi-
cago, and she really wanted to make
sure we knew what the real impact of
gun violence in America was. She
wanted to make sure we knew that the
victims aren’t just those who show up
on the police blotter; the victims are
the parents and the brothers and the
sisters and the friends and the cowork-
ers.
The average number of people who
experience some diagnosable trauma
when somebody in their life is shot and
killed is 20. So when you hear the num-
ber that 100 people in the United States
die every day from guns—which is a
number 10 to 20 times higher than in
any other high-income nation on a per
capita basis—you have to understand
that number isn’t really 100; that num-
ber is 20 times higher than that be-
cause the people who have to live with
that loss have to ask these questions:
Why did they shoot themselves? What
do I do about that individual who shot
my son? How do I get over that com-
bination of pain and anger? That is
hard to understand unless you have
spent time with the mothers and the
fathers who will be dealing with this
catastrophic, life-changing trauma for
the rest of the time they are on this
Earth.
So that is why this is so serious to
me. It is because we have an answer for
their pain—not an answer that will
stop every gun crime in this country
but an answer that will result in thou-
sands fewer people dying. We know
that because the evidence tells us that.
And I can’t explain to these families—
to that mother in Chicago—why some-
thing that has been proven to work and
is supported by 90 percent of Americans
can’t get a vote or a debate in the Sen-
ate.
I will leave it at that for today. I
hope that when this passes in the
House with a big bipartisan majority,
we will take advantage of the oppor-
tunity to get a big bipartisan majority
here in the Senate. If the Republican
majority commits to starting that
process, I guarantee that will be the re-
sult.
I want to thank all of the people who
made this possible in the House today.
For the record, I have introduced a
version of H.R. 8 here in the U.S. Sen-
ate.
To Chairman NADLER, MIKE THOMP-
SON, Speaker PELOSI, Majority Leader
HOYER, and to their Republican cospon-
sors who helped bring it to the floor—
I thank them on behalf of all of the
folks they will never know, those lives
they will save by their action today if
we do the right thing and take it up
here in the Senate.
I yield the floor.

CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it
was 1986, a third of a century ago. Six
U.S. Senators wrote a letter to the Of-
fice of Technology Assessment, the of-
fice then charged with providing tech-
nical and scientific advice to Congress.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that their letter be printed in the
RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
UNITED STATES SENATE,
COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT
AND PUBLIC WORKS,
Washington DC, December 23, 1986.
DR. JOHN GIBBONS,
Executive Director, U.S. Congress, Office of
Technology Assessment, Washington, DC.
DEAR DR. GIBBONS: The Senate Environ-
ment and Public Works Committee has held
three days of hearings this year on the mas-
sive and, to some degree irrevocable, alter-
ations in the stratosphere commonly re-
ferred to as the ‘‘greenhouse affect’’, as well
as ozone depletion.
The testimony convincingly portrayed a
fundamentally altered planet, with shifts in
ocean circulation and climate zones; altered
precipitation and storm patterns; more fre-
quent and extreme weather events such as
droughts, monsoons, and lowland floods. In-
dividually and collectively, these changes
bring about others, ranging from disruption
of forest, crop, and ocean productivity to
shifts in populations. Witnesses before the
Committee testified that the Earth is now
committed to a substantial greenhouse
warming, projected to be about 2 degrees
Centigrade, as well as an ozone layer deple-
tion.
We are deeply troubled by the prospect of
such a rapid and unprecedented change in
the composition of the atmosphere and its
implications for the human and natural
worlds. It may be necessary to act soon to at
least slow these trends or, perhaps, halt
them altogether.
We therefore request that the Office of
Technology Assessment undertake a study
for the Committee on Environment and Pub-
lic Works of policy options that, if enacted,
could lead to the stabilization and minimiza-
tion of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
These gases include carbon dioxide, meth-
ane, nitrous oxide, tropospheric ozone and
chlorofluorocarbons. This is a large and dif-
ficult task but fundamental and perhaps per-
manent alteration of the stratosphere has
profound implications for the future of the
world as we know it.
The Office of Technology Assessment has
proven itself capable of policy analysis on
difficult and complex issues. Despite this,
OTA may find it difficult to immediately
provide a set of options which both complete
and detailed. However, the Congress must
soon begin to weigh the alternatives facing
the United States and other nations. For this
purpose, we hope that you can provide infor-
mation on omissions as well as other consid-
erations relevant to those decisions.
Due to the likelihood that legislation will
be seriously considered by the Committee
early in the next Congress, it would be most
helpful if this analysis could be undertaken
without delay. If we or our staffs can be of
assistance to you or your staff, please do not
hesitate to call upon us.
Sincerely,
ROBERT T. STAFFORD,
U.S. Senate,
JOHN H. CHAFEE,
U.S. Senate,

Mr. WHITEHOUSE. These six U.S.
Senators were troubled by testimony
they had heard about climate change
in three separate hearings of the Sen-
ate’s Environment and Public Works
Committee. They wrote:
The testimony convincingly portrayed a
fundamentally altered planet, with shifts in
ocean circulation and climate zones; altered

quent and extreme weather events such as

Well, that was quite a prediction.

February 27, 2019
Burdick, Democrat from North Dakota;
Max Baucus, Democrat from Montana;
George Mitchell, Democrat from
Maine; Robert Stafford, Republican
from Vermont, the chairman then of
the committee; Dave Durenberger, Re-
publican of Minnesota; and Rhode Is-
land’s Republican Senator, John
Chafee.
You cannot help but be struck that
the prediction back then by these six
Senators is now our reality. Every-
thing they predicted is happening. The
scientists they listened to had it right.
Global temperatures have already risen
by around 1 degree Celsius, and we are
headed to over 2 degrees Celsius of
global warming by the end of the cen-
tury.
Their grim predictions, which we now
live with as fact, motivated these six
Senators to ask the Office of Tech-
nology Assessment for policy options
that ‘‘could lead to the stabilization
and minimization of greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere.’’
Why did they want these policy op-
tions? They wanted to learn about pol-
icy options because, as they continued
in their letter:
Congress must soon begin to weigh the al-
ternatives facing the United States and
other nations. . . . Due to the likelihood
that legislation will be considered by the
Committee early in the next Congress, it
would be most helpful if this analysis could
be undertaken without delay.
‘‘Without delay.’’ Since then, Repub-
licans have demolished the Office of
Technology Assessment; that office no
longer exists. Republicans have relent-
lessly blockaded legislation to address
carbon emissions and have trafficked
in phony climate denial, all while ac-
cepting hundreds of millions of dollars
of political contributions from the fos-
sil fuel industry.
Today, five of those six States are
represented again, having a reunion on
the Senate floor. I see Senator TESTER
from Montana here. I will yield to him
now. We will also be joined by PATRICK
LEAHY of Vermont, AMY KLOBUCHAR of
Minnesota, and ANGUS KING of Maine.
I yield to JON TESTER of Montana,
taking the position of his predecessor,
Max Baucus—whom, by one of the
weird coincidences of the Senate, I just
passed coming out of the trolley.
Senator TESTER, the floor is yours.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana.
Mr. TESTER. I thank Senator WHITE-
HOUSE.
I could not in my wildest dreams be
able to replace Senator Baucus in what
he did. But what he did back in 1986,
along with a number of other Senators
Senator WHITEHOUSE just talked about,
was visionary.
He signed a letter asking Federal re-
searchers to study solutions for lim-
iting the causes of climate change.
This was in 1986, some 33 years ago.
That same year, as I am today, my wife
and I were farming in North Central
Montana, a farm that then had been in
the family for about 70 years.
During the time before 1986, and
since 1986, we have seen a lot of
changes on the farm. That is why it is
interesting—because those changes
have increased more than ever, I be-
lieve, in the last 20 years.
When this letter was sent off to study
solutions in 1986, it was incredibly vi-
sionary because it was before climate
change was even talked about much.
Yet this group of Senators was able to
see the negative impacts of this com-
ing down the pike.
By the way, when we talk about neg-
ative impacts of climate change—you
probably have this, Senator WHITE-
HOUSE, but somebody ought to put to-
gether how many hundreds of billions
of dollars we have spent on natural dis-
asters in the last 10 or 12 years com-
pared to how much we spent in years
previous. I can tell you, it was a few
years ago that every State in the
Union except one or maybe two had a
natural disaster. That is because our
climate is changing. It is because our
climate is getting more erratic. I have
seen it on our farm. I have seen August
turn from the driest month to one of
the wettest months. Over the last 20
years, I have seen a reservoir—a res-
ervoir is a manmade area to hold water
for livestock. I have seen a reservoir
that never went dry from the time my
father built it in the early 1950s to
going dry for consecutive years. I have
seen dangerous floods. I have seen
water where we have never had it be-
fore. I have seen drought like we have
never had it before.
I would just say, in regard to that, we
just had a vote on a guy by the name
of Wheeler, whom the President nomi-
nated to lead the EPA, who actually is
one of these guys who doesn’t believe
in climate change at all. I don’t know
where the President finds these people,
and I don’t know how this body can
support somebody who is this big of a
denier, who wants to slow enforcement
on polluters.
There is one thing we need to keep in
mind in this country when we try to
put people like Wheeler up for head of
EPA. If you take a look at the third-
world nations in this world, those are
the nations that have destroyed their
resource base. If you want to pollute
our water and if you want to pollute
our air, that is destroying our resource
base. I guarantee you, that is not a way
to make America great. It is not even
a way to keep America great.
This nominee is rolling back the
clean water rule. He has allowed more
uses for asbestos in commerce when, in
our State of Montana, Libby can tell
you all about asbestos. People are still
dying from its effects.
That aside—the Wheeler nomination,
which is a catastrophe in itself—I could
tell you that the Senators who stood
on this very floor 33 years ago under-
stood—understood—that we have a
challenge in front of us greater than
any other challenge we have faced be-
fore, and that is climate. As we talk
about what they did in 1986—we are in
2019 now—now is the time to come up
with some workable solutions—work-
able for our climate and workable for
our economy—to get our arms around
this very serious problem.
I am going to tell you what is at risk
here. I love Nevada, but I don’t want
Montana turning into an ecosystem
like Nevada has. We raise some of the
best wheat and the best cattle and the
best post-crops in the world, but it
takes a predictable environment to do
that. In some places in our State, we
are on the edge of desertification, turn-
ing into desert.
The issue that revolves around cli-
mate change impacts each and every
one of us in this body. Whether we are
in denial or not, that is a fact, and it is
incumbent upon us, as Senators who
represent great States all around this
Nation, to come up with solutions that
our kids and our grandkids will be
proud of.
I yield the floor back to Senator
WHITEHOUSE.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank Senator
TESTER.
I will turn to the Rhode Islander who
was in that early bipartisan effort to
understand and address climate
change. Senator John Chafee’s history
of service to his State and country was
remarkable. He saw bloody combat in
World War II on Guadalcanal and Oki-
nawa with the 1st Marine Division. He
went back as a Marine rifle company
commander during the Korean war
with Dog Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th
Marines. He served in Rhode Island’s
legislature and as our Governor. In
1969, he was appointed Secretary of the
Navy. He was elected to the U.S. Sen-
ate in 1976 and chaired the Environ-
ment and Public Works Committee
from 1995 until his death in 1999. In the
small Rhode Island world, he was also
my father’s college roommate and life-
long friend.
The environment was an abiding pas-
sion for this man, and his devotion
showed in his work in the Senate. His
legacy includes the Superfund Pro-
gram, the Oil Pollution Act, and the
1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act,
and his legacy is his early recognition
that climate change, driven by carbon
pollution, caused by fossil fuels, poses
an existential threat to humanity and
the planet we call home.
At the 1986 hearing that led to this
bipartisan letter, Chafee declared:
This is not a matter of Chicken Little tell-
ing us the sky is falling. The scientific evi-
dence . . . is telling us we have a problem; a
serious problem.
This is 1986, and the Republican
chairman of the Environment and Pub-
lic Works Committee is saying that the
scientific evidence is telling us we have
a serious problem.
He went on to say:
Scientists have characterized our treat-
ment of the greenhouse effect as a global ex-
periment. It strikes me as a form of plan-
etary Russian roulette. . . . By not making
policy choices today, by sticking to a ‘‘wait
and see’’ approach . . . [b]y allowing these

gases to continue to build in the atmosphere,
this generation may be committing all of us
to severe economic and environmental dis-
ruption without ever having decided that the
value of ‘‘business as usual’’ is worth the
risks.
Those who believe that these are problems
to be dealt with by future generations are
misleading themselves.
Senator John Chafee, 1986.
I yield now to the distinguished
ranking member of the Appropriations
Committee and honorary Senator pro
tempore, PATRICK LEAHY, here on be-
half of the State of Vermont.
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank
my distinguished colleague from Rhode
Island.
I could not help but think—as I saw
the picture of John Chafee, with whom
I had the honor of serving here in the
Senate—of John Chafee’s close friend-
ship with Robert Stafford, who was my
senior Senator when I came here, both
having served in World War II, both
with a naval background, both people
who cared first and foremost about the
country and the environment. I am
going to speak a little bit further
about Bob Stafford as we go.
When we laid John Chafee to rest in
Rhode Island, I remember sitting there
and listening to the eulogies. Both Re-
publicans and Democrats were speak-
ing about this man.
Also, referring to what the Senator
from Rhode Island has said, more than
30 years ago we had cooperation and bi-
partisanship. It was a hallmark of the
U.S. Senate. It was a bipartisan group
of Senators who sounded the alarm
about climate change. They made a
very modest request to the Office of
Technology Assessment. They said:
Study the issue of climate change and
make recommendations to avert global
disaster.
Those Senators, Republicans and
Democrats alike, were concerned that
human activity might directly cause
permanent, destructive, and wide-
spread changes to our planet’s climate
system—changes that would put our
entire economy, ecosystem, and, our
very own existence at risk.
As I said, one of these Senators was
my senior Senator, my mentor, when I
came here and one of the finest Sen-
ators who ever served—Republican
Robert Stafford, from Vermont.
Today, led by Senator WHITEHOUSE, I
think that what many of us are trying
to do is what Senator Chafee and Sen-
ator Stafford did. We want to recall
that moment in 1986 and renew the
warning those Senators issued 33 years
ago.
Let me speak about Senator Stafford.
When I came here at the ripe old age of
34, I was the only Democrat ever elect-
ed in my State. Robert Stafford was
‘‘Mr. Republican.’’ He took me under
his wing. He had been a Congressman.
He had been a Governor. He had been
an attorney general. He served in
World War II and in Korea. He was a
mentor, but he was also an example.
His legacy is one of sensible, pragmatic
Vermont values that he brought to
Washington for decades. They weren’t
Republican or Democratic.
Senator Stafford was—like most
Vermonters—a champion for the nat-
ural environment. With his work on
landmark environmental legislation,
like the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air
Act, and the Superfund program, Sen-
ator Stafford represented the best of
Vermont’s commitment to sustain-
ability.
His appeals to reason and for com-
mon ground, and his belief in sound
science resonate even more today than
when he left this body three decades
ago. If he were here today, I believe he
would be calling on both sides of the
aisle to act now to ensure that we can
pass on a secure and livable planet for
generations to come and to act before
it is too late.
Today, so many people still refuse to
accept what is now an overwhelming
scientific consensus—that climate
change is real and that humans are the
dominant cause of it. What is worse,
for the last 2 years many in Congress
have willfully accelerated the devasta-
tion caused by global warming by ena-
bling the Trump administration’s ero-
sion of our Nation’s bedrock environ-
mental protections—protections that I
have fought for throughout my nearly
45 years in the Senate.
As climate scientists warn of the ur-
gent need to reduce emissions and re-
verse the global rise in temperatures,
many Senators have refused to pre-
serve even the status quo. Instead, in
the last 2 years, we have seen the roll-
back of commonsense regulations,
often at the behest of private interests
that have spent decades misinforming
the public and suppressing their own
science on the long-term hazards of the
fossil fuel industry.
Alarmingly, this week the Senate is
poised to confirm someone to lead the
Environmental Protection Agency—the
Agency that is charged with safe-
guarding the air and water on which we
depend—who, despite the scientific
consensus, denies that climate change
is the great threat we face today.
To growing numbers of Americans it
is saddening—actually, it is mad-
dening—and most of all, deeply alarm-
ing that the Trump administration and
many others in leadership positions
have made Trumpism’s anti-science,
know-nothing agenda their default po-
sition. This poses existential threats
not only to our children and grand-
children but to our generation.
More than three decades ago, long be-
fore protecting our planet became a
partisan issue, the Environment and
Public Works Committee held 3 days of
hearings on climate change. Those 1986
hearings compelled a bipartisan group
of Senators to acknowledge and warn
the public about a ‘‘fundamentally al-
tered planet’’ as a result of the ‘‘sub-
stantial greenhouse warming’’ that was
projected.
They asked what could be done to
prevent consequences ‘‘ranging from
disruption of forest, crop, and ocean
productivity to shifts in population,’’
and ‘‘extreme weather events, such as
droughts, monsoons, and lowland
floods.’’ These words of warning were
neither radical nor partisan. They were
sensible.
So what has changed since then? The
ice caps are melting—only faster. Cer-
tainly, the glaciers I saw when I visited
Antarctica 25 or so years ago had been
there for eons, and they are now fast
disappearing. Our coastline is still dis-
appearing but faster. Farmers and
ranchers are still concerned about pro-
longed droughts and extreme weather,
only, today, the fires and storms are
more frequent and more devastating.
Just last month, the intelligence
community’s ‘‘Worldwide Threat As-
sessment’’ offered a sobering conclu-
sion. This is the intelligence commu-
nity’s assessment: ‘‘Global environ-
mental and ecological degradation, as
well as climate change, are likely to
fuel competition for resources, eco-
nomic distress, and social discontent
through 2019 and beyond.’’
We know that bipartisan action on
big environmental threats is possible.
In fact, soon after the climate change
hearings in 1986, Marcelle and I climbed
Vermont’s Camel’s Hump with Presi-
dent Reagan’s EPA Administrator. We
wanted to show him the terrible dam-
age caused by acid rain. We could see
that mountain from our home. We
could see the changes up close. They
were very obvious. With President Rea-
gan’s EPA Administrator’s support, we
moved ahead with the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990, and they were
signed into law by President George H.
W. Bush. It was not a partisan issue.
The result was a great reduction in the
scourge of acid rain. We see these re-
sults every day.
Today we are in danger of taking
such results for granted. It is up to us
to protect this planet. If we don’t, who
will? There is no more urgent responsi-
bility.
There are bold ideas for how to ad-
dress this challenge. The Green New
Deal offers a valuable roadmap for de-
bate and a pathway for action. The
time for dallying around the edges of
the issue is over. We all share responsi-
bility for where we are today. So, like-
wise, we have an obligation to attack
this issue, but not with cynical show
votes, not with feel-good votes in-
tended to demonstrate a political di-
vide rather than what should be uni-
versal acknowledgment of what we
know to be true—that climate change
is real, and human activity is the pri-
mary cause of these threats to our way
of life, our communities, and our plan-
et.
We have to channel the American in-
novative spirit that has improved our
lives for centuries. We have to find cre-
ative solutions for reducing carbon
emissions, and then we have to invest
in those solutions. We have to reorient
our workforce toward the great oppor-
tunities that are opening for green-
economy jobs. We should invest in

leading the whole world in developing
clean energy solutions. We have to ad-
dress this real emergency head-on. Not
only can we curb climate change, but,
in doing so, we can transform the
American economy.
Over 30 years ago, a handful of for-
ward-looking Republicans and Demo-
crats stood together in this Senate. I
was proud to be here when they issued
their challenge, but the time for delay
is over. In fact, our time is running
out.
Let this renewed vigor in addressing
climate change, brought about by the
bold proposed Green New Deal, be the
catalyst for real change. Let’s stand
together.
Senator WHITEHOUSE has enlightened
us on so many of these issues, but we
have also learned, as he did, from our
mentors—like Senator Chafee, Senator
Stafford, and the others who got to-
gether in 1986. It is not partisan and it
is not political. It is survival.
I yield the floor.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the dis-
tinguished Senator from Vermont, who
is not only a towering physical pres-
ence on the floor of the Senate but a
towering historic presence on this
floor, as well, and brings a rare and
valuable perspective. I appreciate his
words so much.
The sad thing that we face is that de-
spite words like those uttered by Sen-
ator John Chafee—‘‘allowing these
gases to continue to build in the at-
mosphere . . . may be committing all
of us to severe economic and environ-
mental disruption’’—or the words in
the letter that John Chafee signed
right here and that Senator LEAHY’s
mentor, Bob Stafford, signed right here
back on December 23, 1986, no Repub-
lican Senator can utter those words
today. Today’s Republican Party will
not even acknowledge that climate
change is a serious problem—let alone
put forward a serious proposal to tack-
le it. Republican Leader MITCH MCCON-
NELL’s latest trick is to call, for the
first time, a climate-related measure
on the Senate floor for his side to vote
against it. The leader has not brought
a single piece of climate legislation to
the floor for a vote, ever, until this
vote, which he is bringing up for his
side to vote against.
It actually gets worse. Since the infa-
mous Citizens United Supreme Court
decision almost 10 years ago, no Repub-
lican in the Senate has offered or spon-
sored comprehensive climate legisla-
tion to limit carbon pollution—none.
So we look back with some real sor-
row to 1986, when this bipartisan letter
was written. Of course, Minnesota was
represented in that letter by Dave
Durenberger, and Minnesota is rep-
resented here on the floor today by
Senator KLOBUCHAR.
I yield to her.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota.
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I
thank the Senator from Rhode Island
for his leadership day in and day out on
this issue.
I rise to join him and my other col-
leagues to talk about this letter and to
look back at that moment in time but
really to do it to look forward because
we know it is long past time for bipar-
tisan action on climate change.
As the Senator from Rhode Island
has explained with a copy of that let-
ter, back in 1986, a bipartisan group of
Senators came together to voice their
concerns about the future of our world.
This forward-thinking group of our
predecessors, who were from the same
States as my colleagues who are here
today, held 3 days of hearings on cli-
mate change. That sounds like a pretty
good idea for something we should be
doing right now. It was chaired by, of
course, the Republican Senator from
Rhode Island, Mr. John Chafee.
Minnesota Senator David Duren-
berger was among that group of Sen-
ators. He was born in St. Cloud. He
earned his law degree from the Univer-
sity of Minnesota, was the top-rated
cadet in his ROTC class, and served as
a lieutenant in the Army Counter In-
telligence Corps and as a captain in the
U.S. Army Reserve.
Senator Durenberger took over the
seat left by Senator Humphrey, and
during his 17 years of service in the
Senate, Senator Durenberger proved
time and again that he is a true be-
liever in bipartisanship. He worked
across the aisle to tackle big issues,
and that included talking about cli-
mate change way back in 1986.
I called Senator Durenberger this
week to talk to him, and our staff did,
to get some sense of where he was on
climate change years later. He reported
to us that, in his words, he wanted to
remind Americans there was a time in
our very recent history when the U.S.
Senate made it its responsibility to de-
fine and address some of the critical
national and international policy
issues that threaten the security of our
communities, our Nation, and the
world.
This is Senator Durenberger speak-
ing in the year 2019. He said he could
say ‘‘without reservation that it was
bipartisan Senate leadership that en-
couraged the four Presidents with
whom [he] served—Carter, Reagan,
[George H.W.] Bush, and Clinton—to
prioritize environmental problem defi-
nition and solution.’’
He also recalled working with his col-
leagues on the Environment and Public
Works Committee to ‘‘challenge’’—and
these are his words—‘‘challenge the
scientific community and the business
community to work harder at reducing
the impact [of greenhouse gases] and
suggesting what policies best
incentivize alternative fuels.’’
It was in this bipartisan spirit that
this group of Senators sent a letter to
Dr. John Gibbons, who was then the ex-
ecutive director of the Office of Tech-
nology Assessment. In that letter, they
talked about the need to meet ‘‘the
massive and, to some degree irrev-
ocable, alterations in the stratosphere
commonly referred to as the green-
house effect.’’
The letter goes on to discuss con-
cerns about ‘‘altered precipitation and
storm patterns,’’ something certainly
the Senator from Rhode Island knows
we are seeing right now. These Sen-
ators were ahead of their time—altered
precipitation and storm patterns.
‘‘[M]ore frequent and extreme weath-
er events,’’ they talked about that.
Look at what we are seeing with the
hurricanes, with the rising sea levels,
and with the wildfires in Colorado and
in California.
‘‘[D]isruption of forest, crop, and
ocean productivity.’’ That letter may
have been sent in 1986, but certainly
those Democratic and Republican Sen-
ators were ahead of their time. Ameri-
cans are now increasingly feeling the
effects of changing climate patterns
and extreme weather events. Farmers
are already living through these dis-
ruptions to crop productivity.
So what else did the letter say? Well,
it said this: ‘‘We are deeply troubled by
the prospect of such a rapid and un-
precedented change in the composition
of the atmosphere and its implications
for the human and natural worlds.’’ It
also stated that ‘‘it may be necessary
to act soon to at least slow these
trends or, perhaps, halt them alto-
gether.’’
Think of those words way back in
1986 asking us to act soon. They were
right back then, and they are still
right today. The true tragedy is that
the final paragraph of the letter notes
that any analysis should be undertaken
without delay ‘‘due to the likelihood
that legislation will be seriously con-
sidered by the Committee early in the
next Congress.’’
Well, the truth is, we are still wait-
ing for that legislation to be seriously
considered. The bipartisan call in that
1986 letter came in the 99th Congress,
and we are now beginning the 116th.
Just as troubling, we have lost some of
the bipartisan spirit that guided David
Durenberger and those 1986 lawmakers.
Our inaction has outlasted even the Of-
fice of Technology Assessment itself.
I ask my colleagues, in the spirit of
bipartisanship—from back in 1986, my
colleague Senator Durenberger, who I
hope is listening today—let us continue
that spirit, and let’s get some serious
climate legislation to the floor of the
U.S. Senate.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President,
let me thank Senator KLOBUCHAR for
her wonderful remarks, and of course
Minnesota is a Northern State which
sees this up close all the time.
The Senator spoke of bipartisanship.
Do you know who voted with Senator
Chafee for the Clean Air Act amend-
ments of 1990? The Republican Senate
majority leader did, as did a majority
of the Republican caucus in the Senate.
In fact, those powerful 1990 Clean Air
Act amendments passed 89 to 10. Where
do I go to get a majority leader like
that back? Where do I go to get a Sen-
ate Republican Party like that back?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1518 February 27, 2019
As late as 2009, Donald Trump pub-
lished an advertisement in the New
York Times that said that the climate
science was ‘‘scientifically irref-
utable’’—scientifically irrefutable—and
that if we didn’t do anything about it,
there would be ‘‘catastrophic and irre-
versible consequences for humanity
and our planet.’’ That is Donald Trump
in 2009.
Where do I go to get that Donald
Trump back? What happened? In 2007,
when I first joined this body, there
were Republicans working on climate
legislation all over the place. Senator
KLOBUCHAR and I came together that
year. We had, by my count, five pieces
of bipartisan climate legislation that
were working through this body in var-
ious stages in 2007, 2008, and 2009, when
Donald Trump put this advertisement
in the New York Times saying that the
science was scientifically irrefutable
and the consequences would be cata-
strophic and irreversible.
Then came January of 2010. Then
came the Citizens United decision.
Then came unlimited and often anony-
mous fossil fuel money sloshing around
in America’s politics and all the
threats and promises that unlimited
money allows special interest to en-
gage in. Now, those days, the Donald
Trump of 2009, Republican cooperation
of 2007, 2008, and 2009, and of course this
letter from as long ago as 1986 seems
impossible, but I hope we can get to-
gether. We have to do better than Re-
publican political mischief on climate
change.
Calling up bills that you intend to
vote against—give me a break. Where
is the plan, the Republican, conserv-
ative, serious plan for addressing the
climate crisis? I will tell you where it
is. It is nowhere. Zero. Nada. Nothing.
That has to stop.
Here, on this letter, is one of the
most distinguished, wonderful men
ever to serve in the U.S. Senate, Mr.
George Mitchell of the State of Maine,
and here, representing him today, is
Senator ANGUS KING from the great
State of Maine.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine.
Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise in
sadness and somewhat perplexed be-
cause what we are doing in this col-
loquy is recreating a statement, a let-
ter, as the Senator from Minnesota
outlined, that was sent by six of our
predecessors in December of 1986, warn-
ing about the dangers of climate
change, warning about what this can
do to our country and to our world,
about costs, and about how we had to
take action.
One of those Senators was George
Mitchell of Maine, one of the great leg-
islators of the 20th century. I am hon-
ored to be in the seat that once was oc-
cupied by George Mitchell and also by
his predecessor, Edmund Muskie. I
think the story of the major environ-
mental legislation of the 20th century,
sponsored principally at the beginning
by Edmund Muskie, the Clean Air Act
and Clean Water Act, is worth men-
tioning, if only briefly.
The most important point is that the
Clean Air Act, one of the most impor-
tant and comprehensive environmental
pieces of legislation in our Nation’s
history, passed this body unanimously.
It passed this body unanimously.
It disturbs me that we couldn’t agree
on the time of day around here unani-
mously these days. I don’t know when
this issue became a partisan issue, but
I deeply regret it because it is causing
harm to our country.
What I would like to do is step into
George Mitchell’s shoes for a moment
and read a statement that he himself
wrote and made back in 1986, and you
are not going to believe how prescient
this statement is. It could have been
written yesterday. Here are George
Mitchell’s words:
The problem of global warming is one of
immense significance. It is the most serious
and more pressing than anticipated. Pre-
viously, most of the models forecasting the
rate of global warming focused on the air
pollutants produced by the combustion of
fossil fuels. More recent data suggest that
trace gases may also increase the rate of
warming by a factor of two. This means that
warming may be increasing twice as fast as
previously thought.
The data produced to date suggests there
may be an average increase in temperature
of 1°C since the beginning of the industrial
revolution.
This was in 1986. We are now at about
1.5 degrees centigrade.
Considering how much warmer this June
has been than average, a 1 degree difference
may appear to be insignificant, but an aver-
age of 1 degree increase could be devastating,
so the experts tell us. A 1 degree increase in
the average global temperature would melt
glaciers—
That is happening—
and such melting would increase the sea
level.
That is happening.
There are uncertainties in predicting how
much the sea level would increase in a par-
ticular area. In some cases, it could be an av-
erage increase of a few feet; in others, much
more. For a coastal State like Maine and to
other States along the coastline, such an in-
crease would be devastating.
To deviate from George’s words for a
moment, this is what we see hap-
pening. We are now seeing what are
called rainy day floods, flooding in
areas of our country along the coast
that were rare. Six-month events are
now every high tide.
George Mitchell says:
An average of 1 degree increase in tempera-
ture could have major impacts on agri-
culture. This country’s Midwestern bread
basket could again become a dust bowl. More
heat would mean less water for crops and
variations in growing seasons. It is impor-
tant to keep in mind that this average in-
crease is global in nature. It is not a na-
tional or regional problem. If American
farmers suffer for lack of water, so will farm-
ers all over the planet. If shorelines along
our coasts are flooded, so will shorelines ev-
erywhere in the world.
The enormity of this phenomenon is stag-
gering, and we have a responsibility to limit
emissions of pollutants that trap the heat in
our atmosphere. As difficult, as immense,
and as seemingly remote as the problem is to
our daily lives, we cannot delay.
This was George Mitchell in 1986—we
cannot delay.
There will be those who argue that more
research is necessary to completely under-
stand the phenomenon and to answer every
scientific question.
We are still hearing that argument
today—we need more science; we need
more studies; we are not sure.
George goes on:
As in the case of acid rain, such complete
understanding will come only after we floun-
der in the weight of our shortsighted poli-
cies. This is one more indication that the
benefits of industrialization carry with them
the burden of controlling pollutants. These
pollutants threaten our lakes, fish, health,
and forests today in the form of acid deposi-
tion.
We will hear today that these pollutants
also threaten the future of our planet, which
cannot tolerate such a sudden and dramatic
increase in temperature and survive in a
form familiar to us.
In 1986 George Mitchell said:
Solutions are possible and available. The
statement released at the conclusion of the
Villach Conference in Austria last October—
This was in 1985—
addresses the common nature of some of our
environmental problems. That statement
said in part that ‘‘climate change and sea
level rises due to greenhouse gases are close-
ly linked with other major environmental
issues, such as acid deposition and threats to
the Earth’s ozone shield, mostly due to
changes in the composition of the atmos-
phere by human activity.’’
Reduction in coal and oil use and energy
conservation undertaken to reduce acid dep-
osition will also lower concentration of
greenhouse gases. Reductions in emissions of
chlorofluorocarbons—
Which we achieved—
will help protect the ozone layer and will
also slow the rate of climate change. The
rate and degree of future warming could be
profoundly affected by governmental policies
on energy conservation, use of fossil fuels,
and the emission of greenhouse gases.
Those words were written 32 years
ago.
The rate and degree of future warming
could be profoundly affected by govern-
mental policies on energy conservation, use
of fossil fuels, and the emission of green-
house gases.
The testimony that they were in-
tending to hear at the hearing that
George is describing demonstrated
‘‘that such governmental policies are
needed . . . nationally and on a global
basis.’’
I pause on ‘‘a global basis’’—the trag-
edy of leaving the Paris climate ac-
cord, because the only solution to this
problem has to be local, national, and
global.
The testimony from Federal Agencies
will be that the current government
policy is to conduct more research, a
familiar refrain on issues of this type.
George Mitchell said:
What is missing in the Federal effort is ac-
tion. The problem of global warming brings
another round of scientists before us decry-
ing the folly of waiting until it is too late to

prevent irreversible damage. In the case of
acid rain, research has been offered as a sub-
stitute for much-needed action. This policy
has produced more bodies of water that can-
not sustain life, more trees that are dying,
and more people who find it hard to breathe.
The policy has produced more studies, not
any meaningful change in policy. I hope
these two days of hearings will help persuade
the administration—
And the people of the country—
that inaction has its own costs, almost in-
variably higher than the cost of action.
George Mitchell was right. The cost
of inaction is invariably higher than
the cost of action.
George concluded by saying:
I represent a State that already has been
affected by acid deposition. I want to do all
I can to keep Maine, the rest of our country,
and our planet from facing potentially more
dramatic environmental damage from global
warming. The best way to avoid these unde-
sirable outcomes is to begin taking action
now to prevent further damage rather than
spending twice as much time and later
money repairing damage.
George Mitchell was right in 1986.
Tragically, he is even more right today
because we did not heed his call. We did
not take action. We have avoided ac-
tion.
I don’t want to be the generation
that our children and grandchildren
look back on and say: Where were you
and what did you do when the climate
was deteriorating, when the glaciers
were melting, when the ice sheets were
melting, when the sea level was rising,
when the storms were increasing in in-
tensity, when the wildfires were burn-
ing our States? What did you do, Sen-
ator?
I, for one, want the answer to be ‘‘I
took action.’’ The answer should be
‘‘we took action.’’
Today, this is a challenge even great-
er—significantly greater—than it was
in 1986, but the very fact that people
like Quentin Burdick, George Mitchell,
John Chafee, Bob Stafford, and David
Durenberger saw the future and pre-
dicted it so succinctly and profoundly
should spur us to the type of action
that is necessary to meet, confront,
and overcome this most serious of chal-
lenges before us.
Thank you.
I yield to my colleague from Rhode
Island.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island.
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I will close out
this colloquy by pointing out that the
Republicans of 2007, 2008, and 2009 who
were working on climate legislation
before the Citizens United decision
have left or died or gone to ground. It
is sad to see. These Republicans of 1986,
a third of a century ago, would be
shocked at what has become of their
party. So, today, we, their successors
in five of these six States, gathered on
the floor to honor their memory, to
mourn what has become in the inter-
vening years of the Republican Party,
and to grieve for what this body has
lost.
I yield the floor.

S. RES. 70
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, on Feb-
ruary 13 the Rules Committee approved
S. Res. 70, which authorizes funding for
the Senate’s committees from March 1,
2019, through February 28, 2021. For
this 24-month period, the 18 commit-
tees covered by this resolution are au-
thorized to spend up to $214,055,860.
This is a small increase over the fund-
ing authorized by the current com-
mittee funding resolution, S. Res. 62.
For the information of my colleagues,
committee funding authorized by S.
Res. 70 remains 13 percent below levels
from a decade ago.
Committees are the lifeblood of the
legislative process. It is in our commit-
tees that policy is created and pro-
grams and agencies are overseen. Our
committees are where the Senate first
exercises its advice and consent func-
tion over the executive branch’s nomi-
nees. Well-functioning committees are
crucial to the Senate’s role as a sepa-
rate but equal branch of the govern-
ment.
The resolution before the Senate is
the result of a bipartisan process Sen-
ator KLOBUCHAR, the Rules Commit-
tee’s ranking member, and I undertook
this year to solicit more input from
committee chairmen and ranking
members. The resolution reflects the
needs identified by our colleagues and
will help ensure our committees are
able to carry out their responsibilities
and duties.
I would like to thank Fitz Elder and
Rachelle Schroeder from my com-
mittee staff; Lizzy Peluso and Lindsey
Kerr from Senator KLOBUCHAR’s com-
mittee staff; and Cindy Qualley, the
Rules Committee’s chief clerk. Addi-
tionally, I would like to thank Ileana
Garcia and Ted Ruckner from the Dis-
bursing Office and John Henderson
from the Office of Legislative Counsel.
I greatly appreciate their hard work in
developing this resolution.

THE GREEN NEW DEAL
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I just lis-
tened to the other debate on the floor,
and it reminded me of the fact that our
friends on the other side of the aisle in-
troduced a resolution calling on the
Federal Government to adopt what
they call the Green New Deal.
From my point of view, the legisla-
tion is pretty far outside the main-
stream in what it is proposing and how
it is proposing the problems we should
be debating. I don’t have any problem
with that. Those problems should be
solved, and even though it seems pret-
ty far outside the mainstream of
thought, at least 12 of our colleagues in
the Senate have cosponsored it. The
majority leader thought it would be
fair if we had that idea out there—it is

getting a lot of public attention—to
have a chance to debate this legislation
and vote on it in the Senate.
The Democrats have called it a sham.
They said: Why should we have debate
on this piece of legislation? Why would
we want to vote on this piece of legisla-
tion?
Now, it is not cosponsored by a ma-
jority of the Members of the Senate,
but it is cosponsored by over 25 percent
of the Democrats in the Senate, and
one would think that if 25 percent of
their conference is sponsoring a bill,
they would be glad to come to the floor
and talk about that bill and talk about
what it does.
So let’s talk for just a couple of min-
utes about what that bill actually says.
One of the things that it does is that it
calls for the United States to use 100
percent renewable energy by 2030. That
is just a little more than 10 years from
now. It says, basically, that we want to
have a zero-carbon-dioxide emissions
by then.
I know there was some discussion in
the rolling out of this bill that that
would mean that ground transpor-
tation and air transportation would ei-
ther be eliminated or minimized—at
least the way we travel right now
would be. At some point in the future
that may happen, but it is highly un-
likely it is going to happen in the next
10 years, which is what the bill calls
for. Maybe that is why they don’t want
to debate it. Even President Obama’s
former science adviser says that this is
not feasible. Harvard University pro-
fessor John Holdren was quoted in the
New York Times saying: ‘‘As a tech-
nologist studying this problem for 50
years, I don’t think we can do it.’’
So that is a pretty good source who
indicates that what we are talking
about here can’t happen. So that big
headline goal appears to be impossible,
but we probably could debate it any-
way. Let’s hear from the other side,
particularly the 12 cosponsors, to say
why it is possible, why we should be
able to do that, and why that is in the
legislation that they filed.
The rest of the legislation goes really
beyond things that don’t relate to the
environment. There is a laundry list of
policies that appear to be popular right
now in the so-called progressive discus-
sion. One is a single-payer health sys-
tem and the other is a Federal job
guarantee. The talking points sug-
gested that that would be a Federal job
guarantee for people who can’t work or
aren’t willing to work. Of course, that
was so controversial that immediately
people began to say: Well, maybe that
is something that the Republicans
snuck into our talking points. But it
turned out that wasn’t true.
There is a provision calling for ‘‘re-
pairing the historic oppression of . . .
youth.’’ That is sort of what this whole
Green New Deal seems to focus on—ac-
cepting responsibility in a debate for
things that really don’t make the kind
of sense one would want them to make
as you move toward legislation. They
don’t really say what the ‘‘historic op-
pression of youth’’ was. Probably that
is not related to the economy or the
environment or the greenness of the
Green New Deal.
But even if we agree that these ideas
are good ideas, the other question is
this: How much is it going to cost?
The American Action Forum looked
at the biggest parts of the legislation,
and they estimated that the total
would run anywhere from $51 trillion
to $94 trillion over 10 years. To put this
in perspective, the Congress right now
appropriates about $1.5 trillion a year.
We spend more than that through pro-
grams that are in place like Social Se-
curity, Medicare, and Medicaid, but we
appropriate $1.5 trillion a year. If the
estimates of the Green New Deal are
right, that would suddenly become $5
trillion to $9 trillion a year. That is a
pretty good multiplier of $1.5 trillion a
year—six times, in fact, of what we are
spending now—at the $9 trillion level.
That works out to be about $65,000 per
family per year. That would probably
be more government than we could af-
ford, but that is how it works out.
There is nothing that talks about
how families are supposed to come up
with their share of the bill.
While some of the ideas in the Green
New Deal—Medicare for all or a job for
everybody, guaranteed by the govern-
ment—sound like good ideas, I don’t
think they are going to stand the test
of the debate. I think that is one of the
reasons that maybe the other side
doesn’t want to have the debate.
Some talk about: Well, maybe we
will all vote present or we will not vote
at all.
I think it is pretty hard to defend
what you are out there talking about
when you are not willing to come to
the floor and talk about it. That is a
debate we are going to have. I suspect
we are going to have it sometime this
month, and I look forward to engaging
in that debate.
This week, we are having another de-
bate on nominees. Right now, the de-
bate is on the nominee for the Admin-
istrator of the EPA. There has been
some discussion of the environment in
the debate on the Administrator of the
EPA. Next, we are going to go to some-
one to serve on the TVA commission.
This is somebody who has been voted
out of committee two times in bipar-
tisan voice votes and never allowed to
have a vote in the Senate.
I will remind my colleagues again
that under President Reagan, the aver-
age time in days from when a person
was voted out of committee—and re-
member, as all of us on the floor would
know, the committee is where ques-
tions are asked, and the background
check has been completed. That may
take a substantial amount of time, de-
pending on the nominee and how com-
plicated their information is—some-
times less time, sometimes more. That
has all happened in the committee.
Under President Reagan, the average
number of days from the time a person
was voted out of committee until they
were voted on, on the floor was 5. The
total number of times the majority had
to file cloture to get that vote was less
than a handful in the entire first 2
years.
For President Trump, the average
number of days for a nominee to be
voted on is 55, and the majority leader
had to file cloture 128 times even to get
a vote. We are going through some of
those votes this week. The 30 hours of
debate almost never includes debate
about the nominee who is using up
floor time that could be used for debat-
ing how we spend our money, how we
defend our country, or what our foreign
policy oversight responsibilities are
going to be.
We are going to continue to look at
the options and continue to talk to our
friends on the other side about how 60
Senators can work together to change
the rules in a way that they would be
changed going forward to get the rules
back more to the days of Ronald
Reagan, George Herbert Walker Bush,
Bill Clinton, and all of their prede-
cessors, where nominees were never
used as a way to use up time. Nominees
were never held hostage so that other
legislation or debate couldn’t occur.
We are working hard to find 60 of us
who want to return to a time when leg-
islative priorities in the Senate still
had the protections of the minority
that have always been there, but those
protections couldn’t be used to the dis-
advantage of people who have stepped
up and are willing to serve and are
often voted out of committee on a bi-
partisan basis, only to be held up on
the floor.
I look forward to the debate on the
Green New Deal. I look forward to the
other debates we are going to have on
the floor of the Senate this year.
For the people who are willing to
serve, who have been reported out of
committee, who have been thoroughly
questioned and investigated but can’t
get that vote and get to work, that is
not what we want to do. That is not
who we should want to be. I hope we
can work together to find a way to
change that rule as well.
I see my good friend, the Senator
from Hawaii, is here. We are working
on some things together right now that
we would like to get to the floor and
have those bills voted on later.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). The Senator from Hawaii.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I thank
the Senator from Missouri. I thank
him for his leadership and
levelheadedness.
As he is on his way out, I will say
that I think the current way we deal
with nominees is not tenable. I imagine
a scenario where we have a Democratic
President, and it will take even longer
than it is currently taking to confirm
nominees. I think there are a number
of us on both sides of the aisle who are
open to modifying the way we operate.

with the blue slips undermines the in-
dividual ability for any Senator to
have their say, especially as it relates
to the circuit courts, but I think there
is an opportunity to have a conversa-
tion.
On climate generally, I am looking
forward to a debate, but it is very dif-
ficult to debate in the Senate when
only one party proffers a proposal. I
don’t mean this as rhetorical flourish.
I don’t mean this as a personal accusa-
tion or a partisan attack. It is just a
fact that there are no climate pro-
posals coming from the Senators who
are Republican. There are zero. So they
are trying to have a debate about a res-
olution which was nonbinding and
which was signed by 12 Senators. I get
it, but I think, given that this is the
world’s greatest deliberative body, we
ought to have a proper debate about
climate change.
We are actually in a climate emer-
gency. This is the most important mo-
ment in the world’s history as it re-
lates to this particular crisis. We are
sitting here trying to score points
about an FAQ that was posted on a new
Congresswoman’s website and trying to
make fun of each other and say: They
are going to ban cows and ice cream. It
is very silly, and it is not worthy of the
seriousness of the moment.
I would ask my Republican col-
leagues—I see a number of them who
take the debt, foreign policy, cyber se-
curity, personal privacy, and the rules
of the Senate very seriously. They are
very levelheaded human beings with a
seriousness of purpose. Yet when it
comes to climate change, it gets into
this goofy thing where they are doing
everything except debating climate
change and what ought to be done
about it.
We spent 5, maybe 10 years trying to
get most Republicans to concede that
this problem exists at all. Now a lot of
them are feeling comfortable saying:
Yes, this problem exists, but all of the
solutions proposed by Democrats are
wrong.
That is fine, but I ask this question
in all sincerity: What do Republican
Senators propose to do about the cli-
mate crisis? What is your plan? If you
don’t like cap and trade; if you don’t
like a fee on carbon; if you don’t like
massive investment in green tech-
nology and clean technology; if you
don’t like the extension of the invest-
ment tax credit and the production tax
credit; if you don’t like our solution; if
you don’t like being part of the Paris
climate accord—which, by the way, is
nonbinding, which means we get to de-
cide what our pathway is to clean en-
ergy. It is not as though the U.N. gets
to tell us what to do. It gives us lever-
age to make sure that as we move for-
ward toward clean energy, the other
countries don’t cheat. It actually gives
us leverage in this situation.
If you don’t like our solutions, that
is fine. This is the world’s greatest de-
liberative body. This is where the
greatest debates in U.S. history have
happened. Yet, maybe 19 times out of
20, I have come down to the floor to
talk about climate change, and there
were Members on this side of the aisle
and zero Members on the other side of
the aisle. Again, I don’t mean this as
an attack; I just want a real debate.
I am looking at the Senator from
Georgia. We have had robust discus-
sions about debt and deficits and the
way we try to avoid shutdowns and se-
quester and all the rest of it. When it
comes to climate change, everybody
gets really goofy. Everybody puts on
their partisan uniform and refuses to
engage. If this debate about the Green
New Deal offers us an opportunity to
talk about the planetary crisis, then I
am happy for it.
We are in debate time on the nomina-
tion of Andrew Wheeler to lead the
EPA, so it might be helpful to know
the origins of the Agency.
In the 1960s, the state of the environ-
ment was catastrophic. Millions of
freshwater fish and rivers around the
country were being poisoned by insecti-
cides, hurting consumer trust and the
countless fishermen and families who
made a living that way. Pollution was
so bad that debris floating in the Cuya-
hoga River actually caught on fire,
causing thousands of dollars in prop-
erty damage. The water in Lake Supe-
rior became so toxic from companies’
dumping asbestos-laden waste that
local communities had to start fil-
tering their own water. Think about
that. People could drink the water
from their local reservoirs unfiltered
until industrial pollution came along.
This was the path our country was
on. Pollution was destroying many of
the most beautiful places in the coun-
try and, maybe more importantly, put-
ting the health of the public at risk.
A scientist named Rachel Carson
came along and changed everything
when she wrote a book that helped the
United States see that we couldn’t go
on like this. Her book was a call for
change, and millions of Americans, on
a bipartisan basis, demanded change.
There was a predictable backlash.
Here is what one industry spokesman
said as public opinion began to coa-
lesce around addressing pollution:
The major claims of Miss Rachel Carson’s
book ‘‘Silent Spring’’ are gross distortions of
the actual facts, completely unsupported by
scientific, experimental evidence, and gen-
eral practical experience in the field. Her
suggestion that pesticides are in fact
biocides destroying all life is obviously ab-
surd in the light of the fact that without se-
lective biologicals, these compounds would
be completely useless.
This controversy went on for the
next few years. The public, the science,
and the reality pointed toward the
truth, but a few loud voices tried to
stop the country from making
progress. They said that Rachel Carson
distorted the facts, that the science
wasn’t there, and that there was no
need to rush judgment.
The U.S. Government moved forward
anyway and began to lay the founda-
tion for a new America—one that
would preserve and protect our country
and its resources for the next genera-
tion.
In 1970, President Nixon united sev-
eral offices and bureaus already in the
Federal Government into one single
agency, the EPA. The EPA was charged
with protecting the Nation’s health
and being the steward of the environ-
ment. It has a legacy of fulfilling that
mission. The Agency ended the use of a
dangerous pesticide called DDT. It
found a solution to acid rain, which
was once a major issue for fish, forests,
and farming. It took on secondhand
smoke, banning smoking in indoor pub-
lic places.
Thanks to the EPA, Rachel Carson’s
‘‘fable for tomorrow’’ did not become a
reality, but here we are decades later
facing another environmental crisis,
one that affects the United States and
every other Nation on this planet, and
I am worried that we are not going to
do the right thing this time.
Instead of facing head-on and in a bi-
partisan way the biggest crisis in the
planet’s history, the party in power is
not just ignoring the problem; they are
making it worse. And they are doing it
by nominating and confirming people
like Andrew Wheeler. This is someone
who said: ‘‘Manmade global warming is
the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on
the American people.’’ This is the guy
to head the EPA. He says manmade
global warming is a hoax. This is some-
one who was formally the vice presi-
dent of the Washington Coal Club, who
lobbied for coal companies.
We are in a planetary emergency, and
Republicans want someone who is ad-
vancing the interests of top polluters
to be the Nation’s chief environmental
steward so that he can continue to ad-
vance the interest of the top polluters.
Again, it is not just that they are ig-
noring climate change, which would be
bad enough; it is that they are aggres-
sively, proudly, gleefully sometimes,
making it worse.
Researchers at Harvard found that
the EPA’s recent plans to gut the
Clean Power Plan will lead to more
greenhouse gas emissions. Their plan
will be worse for climate than if they
did nothing at all. Think about that. If
the EPA did nothing at all, it would be
better than what they are doing now.
This is the result of Mr. Wheeler’s lead-
ership, which has until now been in an
Acting Director capacity.
During the Presidency of Ronald
Reagan, the EPA was led by Anne
Gorsuch Burford, who ended up resign-
ing in scandal. President Reagan nomi-
nated as her replacement William
Ruckelshaus, whom people trusted to
do the job and stabilize the EPA. He
was a moderate. He was a steady hand.
The EPA could use a steady hand after
Scott Pruitt, who promoted the inter-
ests of polluters over the health of the
American people and who crossed many
ethical lines. Yet Andrew Wheeler is no
Ruckelshaus. That much is clear from
his time at the EPA. Under his leader-
ship, EPA inspections are at a 10-year

low. EPA fines are at a 25-year low. Re-
strictions on new coal plants have been
eliminated. Limits on methane pollu-
tion are in the process of being rolled
back. In other words, polluters are get-
ting their way. That is great news for
people who own oil and gas companies,
but it is horrible news for people with
asthma, for farmers who are trying to
get through the worst drought season
seen in a century, and for small busi-
nesses that are losing customers be-
cause of fires.
Listen, climate change is here. It is
hurting everything from local econo-
mies, to public health, to national se-
curity, and the Republicans have de-
cided that the best person to lead the
Agency to do something about it is a
coal lobbyist. It would be funny if it
were not so outrageous.
The Democrats have a plan for cli-
mate change. We have ideas to invest
in clean air, clean water, and smarter
infrastructure. We have bills on invest-
ment and production tax credits, solar
energy, wind energy, conservation and
efficiency, carbon pricing, and planting
trees, and we have stood together
against nominations like this one. It is
time for the Republicans, if not to
stand with us, to at least then stand on
the other side against us and engage in
this great debate. What are we going to
do with climate change? We have pro-
posals, and they have none.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia.
DISASTER RELIEF
Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise to
talk about a crisis in my home State
and indeed five other States across the
Southeast. I rise to talk about disas-
ters in California and to talk about our
friends in Puerto Rico.
On October 10, 2018, Hurricane Mi-
chael made landfall on the Florida
Panhandle as a category 4 hurricane. It
was one of the strongest storms to ever
hit the United States. Over the next
few hours, Hurricane Michael barreled
through Florida and tore through
southwest Georgia. In a matter of min-
utes, homes were flattened, tracks of
timber were destroyed, and farmers’
crops lay down in the field. People’s
lives were radically affected forever.
This hurricane hit at exactly the
time of year when most crops were
ready for harvest. It doesn’t matter if
they were peanuts, cotton, or pecans—
they were all just beautiful this year.
As a matter of fact, in the State of
Georgia, I grew up working on our fam-
ily’s farm there, and I have to say the
cotton crop last year was probably the
best I had ever seen. It was almost
cruel. Today, agriculture is Georgia’s
top industry and our No. 1 economic
driver. Before the hurricane, farmers in
my State were expecting a record har-
vest. Instead, their crops were com-
pletely destroyed.
Shortly after the hurricane hit,
President Trump, Vice President
PENCE, and Secretary of Agriculture
Perdue all came down to Georgia. To-
gether, we toured the devastation and
heard from farmers and local officials
about the tough road of recovery
ahead. Some farmers said they could
clean up, replant, and have a crop next
year as long as they had adequate re-
sources. Other farmers were not so
lucky.
Georgia is the top pecan-producing
State in the country. One of our larg-
est pecan farms is owned by two broth-
ers in Bainbridge, which the Vice
President and I personally visited. We
personally saw the damage in their
fields. Some 800 acres of pecan trees
were gone. I cannot describe to you
what that looks like. On the ground
was a solid carpet—if you can imagine
this—of mature, beautiful, inch-long
pecans that were ready to be harvested
but were on the ground, ruined.
One brother said:
The farmer in me wants to farm this land,
but there’s no way I can make it. Next year
is the year I’ll lose it, because we’re not like
the cotton guy. Nothing against them, but
they get to replant a seed next year and have
a crop. I don’t.
The problem is that the pecan crop
can be annually insured, but there is
no insurance product for insuring
pecan trees. If these two brothers re-
plant, it could take 7 to 10 years for the
trees to mature enough to even gen-
erate a minimum revenue. Most likely,
full production would take over 12
years. For them, this is truly a genera-
tional loss.
The other brother said:
My brother and I built this business from
nothing. We will make it. We may not be in
the pecan business anymore, but we will be
doing something else. We are fighters. [Our
families are committed to this land.] You
just have to go on.
When they saw the devastation,
President Trump and Vice President
PENCE stepped up to the plate and
made a commitment to our agriculture
community.
President Trump said: ‘‘Farmers
really got hurt here, especially in
Georgia, but we’re going to get it
taken care of.’’
Vice President PENCE said:
We will rebuild these crops and these com-
munities. We will restore southwest Georgia.
We will restore the Sunbelt region bigger
and better than ever before.
This afternoon, I am here to say that
the Vice President and the President
are living up to their word. After this
disaster relief was caught up in the po-
litical nightmare of funding the last 25
percent of this year’s budget, we now
have the opportunity to put this stand-
alone supplemental appropriations bill
on the floor of the Senate. The Presi-
dent and Vice President have been ab-
solutely resolute in their support of
getting aid to the victims of these dis-
asters. They are now asking Congress
to pass this all-inclusive disaster relief
bill right now.
The State of Georgia has already
stepped up and offered tax credits,
short-term financing, and other forms
of direct assistance to those who have
been impacted, but they have only
scratched the surface. The people of
Georgia have come together and helped
their neighbors, served meals to each
other, and assisted first responders in
their recovery efforts.
In Florida alone, then-Governor RICK
SCOTT, who is now our colleague here
on the Senate floor, was in the race for
this Senate seat, and he actually sus-
pended his campaign to devote all of
his time, in his responsibility as the
Governor, to lead the effort of ana-
lyzing the damage in Florida and deter-
mining what needed to be done. He can
speak directly to the need. He is a co-
sponsor of this bill, I might add.
However, despite efforts by Senator
ISAKSON and others and me in our
State, this Senate body has yet to take
action on disaster relief for the agri-
culture community in the Southeast.
Our farmers simply cannot wait any
longer. The situation in my State is
dire. I would say it is the same across
the South. Because revenue from the
2018 harvest was destroyed, bankers
can’t lend money to farmers who right
now are asking to borrow money to put
seed in the ground, to fertilize the
ground, and to prepare the ground for
next year’s crop. It is as simple as that.
Growers cannot replant because they
can’t get their financial houses in
order because we haven’t adopted a res-
olution for last year’s harvest that
they were not able to achieve. Rural
communities are suffering, and in
many places, economic activity is at
an absolute standstill as it waits for
the Federal Government—this body
and the House of Representatives—to
do its job.
For some in my State, the timing of
assistance is not just a matter of put-
ting a crop in the ground this year; it
is a matter of potentially never putting
a crop in the ground again. If we do not
help these people right now, they may
lose their businesses and livelihoods
through no fault of their own. That is
the reality we are facing here. The peo-
ple in my State have asked me to uti-
lize every sphere of influence, turn over
every stone, and exhaust all options to
get disaster relief right now.
We are past the time when this
should have gotten done. I have spoken
with the President many times about
this. His commitment to our farmers is
unwavering. Just last Monday night,
he said: DAVID, get it done. He called
me again on Saturday night before he
left for Vietnam. He said: DAVID, what
do we have to do to get this bill across
the Senate floor? Talk to our friends in
the House, and make sure that every-
thing that is needed is in.
Senator ISAKSON, I, and several other
Senators have introduced a supple-
mental disaster relief bill on the floor
of the Senate, and President Trump
has agreed to sign it. Our bill includes
disaster relief for agriculture. It also
provides additional funds for Georgia
and other States like Florida, Ala-
bama, the Carolinas, Alaska, Hawaii,
and California that have battled nat-
ural disasters over the last year on

their own. It also builds on the Trump
administration’s past efforts and in-
cludes the remaining funding for Puer-
to Rico.
Both the House and Senate have pre-
viously supported similar proposals.
They should be even more inclined to
do so now that it is not tied up with
the overall 2019 budget drama. This is a
standalone supplemental bill that in-
cludes those things that people on both
sides of this body agreed to and voted
for just last year. This bipartisan pack-
age is a win for our farmers. It is a win
for families and businesses that were
devastated by historic hurricanes in
the Southeast and wildfires in the
West. It is a win for the people of Puer-
to Rico whom the President has pre-
viously helped. He was committed to
including that in this bill.
I sincerely hope this body will move
quickly and pass this disaster relief
bill without further delay. I humbly
ask each of my colleagues in this body
for their individual support and for
their vote in this disaster relief pack-
age that will save hundreds, if not
thousands, of farming families in my
home State from having to give up
what they love, and that is farming the
land that in many cases they inherited
from their families. In other cases, peo-
ple who graduated from HBCUs—some
of our brightest young people—bor-
rowed money to buy the land or are
leasing the land, and they are in dan-
ger of losing this dream of making a
living on the ground in Georgia.
Our country and our people are
counting on us to get this done, and
time is of the essence.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
NOMINATION OF ANDREW WHEELER
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I
come to the floor in opposition to An-
drew Wheeler’s nomination to lead the
Environmental Protection Agency.
Americans across this country de-
pend on EPA to protect their public
health, yet under this administration,
EPA has failed again and again to reas-
sure my constituents that their basic
rights to breathe in clean air and sip
clean water are being prioritized.
Listen, I am proud that EPA’s Region
5 office is headquartered in Chicago.
Region 5 has led the country in enforc-
ing the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water
Act, and other bedrock environmental
policies that Congress has passed. But
under Mr. Wheeler and this administra-
tion, EPA has made it harder for the
scientists, engineers, and public health
experts in Region 5 to do their jobs.
EPA is severely understaffed and un-
derfunded, and in 2018, major enforce-
ment actions dropped to their lowest
levels in more than 10 years. Last year,
EPA competed fewer than 11,000 inspec-
tions and evaluations of polluters
across the country—the lowest number
in almost two decades.
In 2018, EPA sent just 123 civil pollu-
tion violation cases to the Justice De-
partment for prosecution. That is
about 40 percent less than the annual
average during the Obama administra-
tion. So, sadly, it should come as no
surprise that a report from the Envi-
ronmental Integrity Project this
month found that communities across
the country are now being put at risk
of exposure to dangerous contami-
nants.
To make matters worse, the EPA’s
enforcement workforce has been
shrinking for years, and the Trump ad-
ministration wants to cut it back even
further.
These cutbacks are leaving commu-
nities, especially low-income commu-
nities and those of color, exposed to
public health risks. Meanwhile, pol-
luters are being let off the hook for se-
rious violations of the law.
I have seen firsthand what happens
when EPA fails to enforce our laws and
protect public health. It causes fear
and confusion. For months, residents
in Willowbrook, IL, have lived in fear
that the air they breathe in has been
making their family sick.
Here is a little background. A facility
in their community has been releasing
cancer-causing emissions for decades.
Unfortunately, even since EPA discov-
ered just how toxic this chemical was
years ago—years ago—they have re-
fused to issue new regulations updating
safety standards based on the latest
science.
Making matters even worse, EPA of-
ficials refused to notify local public
health or elected officials about their
discovery, leaving communities in the
dark even while their health is at risk,
leaving more families more likely to
get sick, leaving more children more
likely to die.
As a mother, this is heartbreaking.
As a Senator, this is outrageous.
When Willowbrook residents first
started to raise concerns, EPA wasn’t
the least bit transparent. The Agency
had to be pushed by Senator DURBIN,
other Members of the Illinois congres-
sional delegation, and me just to hold
community forums.
My office also received alarming in-
formation alleging that senior political
appointees instructed EPA personnel
not to inspect any facility in Region 5
that emits the same carcinogen found
at this facility. If true, this type of po-
litical interference is beyond unaccept-
able. If true, it is happening on Mr.
Wheeler’s watch.
I have asked EPA to take several
steps to fix this crisis, and I am still
waiting for their response.
In the absence of leadership from
EPA, Senator DURBIN and I have au-
thored two pieces of legislation to en-
sure that this kind of crisis never hap-
pens again.
Here is what Gabriela, a resident of
Willowbrook, said when she saw the
list of health problems associated with
this facility: ‘‘It was like reading our
medical history.’’
Since she moved to her home in 2009,
Gabriela has suffered from intense
headaches, dizziness, nausea, inability
to concentrate, and memory loss. She
has found it difficult to read through
briefs and almost instantly forgets
movie plots and even some conversa-
tions.
Both of her children, who have lived
in the house for most of their lives,
have had respiratory problems since
they were little. Her 12-year-old daugh-
ter has often coughed to the point of
vomiting and has developed a bone
cyst.
One of her 9-year-old daughter’s
classmates was recently diagnosed
with leukemia, as was Gabriella’s next-
door neighbor, an otherwise healthy
man in his early fifties.
Another woman I have gotten to
know from Willowbrook is named
Neringa. She told me that when she
and her husband were moving to Chi-
cago 5 years ago, they picked their
home because it seemed like a place
where their children would be safe.
She went on:
You look for sexual predators, good
schools, taxes. You don’t think you would
have to look at air and water. You feel like
it is the one thing in our country we
wouldn’t have to think about.
Exposure from toxic pollution is a
matter of life and death for these resi-
dents. It was uncovered only when ca-
reer civil servants did their job and
flagged a risk they observed in a rou-
tine model that EPA publishes.
I am extremely concerned that other
areas in Illinois could face similar
issues and that other kids in other
communities could be breathing in air
full of cancer-causing chemicals when
they are playing on the swings at re-
cess or walking home from school later
that afternoon.
I need EPA to respond to the re-
quests I have made on behalf of Lake
County and actually conduct the kind
of monitoring that exposed the prob-
lem in Willowbrook there and in every
community that may be at risk.
Not far from Willowbrook, residents
in Chicago have also been facing sev-
eral public health threats for decades.
Chicago, IL, is the birthplace of
Hazel Johnson, the ‘‘Mother of the En-
vironmental Justice Movement,’’ a pio-
neer of environmental justice activism
on the South Side of Chicago.
She founded People for Community
Recovery in 1979 in an effort to get as-
bestos out of the buildings in her com-
munity. Soon she managed to trace air
and water pollution in her community
to nearby industry, which was using
the predominantly lower income Afri-
can-American community as a dump-
ing ground.
Hazel Johnson knew what I know:
Every American has a right to breathe
in safe air, drink clean water, and live

on uncontaminated land, no matter
where they live, no matter the color of
their skin, no matter their tax bracket.
Yet I still hear about manganese pol-
lution, petcoke, particulate matter,
and lead exposure from these residents
on a daily basis.
Chicago residents deserve—no, they
need—environmental justice. But for
some reason, this administration has
dismantled the office that is supposed
to lead this work, even trying to elimi-
nate EPA’s environmental justice fund-
ing and drive out the office’s top tal-
ent.
Lead exposure is an issue that im-
pacts low-income families and commu-
nities of color disproportionately. I had
high hopes that I would be able to work
with Mr. Wheeler on the administra-
tion’s response to this crisis. Yet after
months and months of delays, I am
very disappointed by their so-called
plan.
Mr. Wheeler’s lead action plan falls
short of what was promised and the
‘‘war on lead’’ his predecessor declared.
This is not a plan with goals, strate-
gies, and deadlines. Instead, it is a re-
packaged version of a report published
under the Obama administration. Lit-
tle has changed, other than the window
dressing.
What disappointed me most was that
the administration appears to be walk-
ing back our goal of eliminating lead
exposure, settling simply for reducing
it. That is unacceptable.
Even to this day, in a post-Flint cri-
sis world, too many in power are sit-
ting idly by as countless Americans are
exposed to lead. More than 6 million
homes get water from lead service
lines, and 24 million homes have lead
hazards in paint, dust, or soil. Nearly
half a million children have elevated
levels of lead in their blood.
Let’s be clear. For children, there is
no safe level of lead allowable in drink-
ing water. Even low levels can cause
permanent brain damage in kids, low-
ering IQ, and inflicting other cognitive
damage. Imagine if your child were one
of those who had gotten sick because
the EPA refused to take action on such
an obvious crisis. Imagine how infuri-
ating, how devastating that would be.
We must make meaningful progress
in tackling sources of exposure, and
EPA must take up an aggressive, com-
prehensive, and practical strategy.
I know we can make real progress in
reducing lead in our society, but the
new lead action plan is a missed oppor-
tunity to advance those efforts.
I also believe that Mr. Wheeler has
far too many conflicts of interest to be
running the EPA. As a former lobbyist
for Murray Energy, Mr. Wheeler has
worked closely with the industries he
would regulate as the leader of the
EPA. It is well reported that Mr.
Wheeler’s former firm lobbied the EPA
on efforts Wheeler now oversees.
Even after he took temporary reins
of the EPA, he made no secret of meet-
ing with former clients and fossil fuel
industry representatives. CNN and
Reuters have both reported that Wheel-
er is heavily prioritizing meetings with
industry over anyone else and has at-
tended more than 50 meetings with
companies or industry groups that
EPA regulates.
If this news doesn’t alarm you, it
may be because corruption is becoming
routine under this administration.
After all, just earlier this week, the
Washington Post reported that the As-
sistant Administrator for Air and Radi-
ation, Bill Wehrum, has been routinely
meeting with former clients in the fos-
sil fuel industry from his not-so-long-
ago lobbying days.
I placed a hold on Mr. Wehrum’s
nomination because I did not think he
could be trusted with our Nation’s air.
I feel the same way about Mr. Wheel-
er’s leading the EPA.
According to the Sierra Club, every
third day during his first 100 days as
Acting Administrator, Mr. Wheeler ei-
ther, one, rolled back a new climate
policy; two, ignored or contradicted
science; three, met with big polluters;
four, limited the EPA’s ability to pro-
tect us from pollution; or, five, gave in
to corporate polluter demands—all of
that in just his first 3 months and
change. Imagine what would happen if
we gave him the reins for good.
Mr. Wheeler’s position on climate
change policy alone is disqualifying.
Consider, for example, his attack on
the Clean Power Plan. Climate change
is a major threat to our environment,
our economy, and our national secu-
rity—something that even Donald
Trump’s own intelligence officials
admit.
My home State of Illinois is already
experiencing the consequences of inac-
tion. Growing seasons are changing,
heat waves are increasing, and extreme
floods are becoming more frequent and
more severe. Just this December we
had a hurricane. Mitigating these ef-
fects will require sensible policies that
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and
invest in clean energy.
Under the Clean Water Act, EPA is
legally required to limit carbon pollu-
tion from powerplants, pollution that
we know is the primary driver of cli-
mate change.
That is why the Obama administra-
tion established a Clean Power Plan—
to provide States the flexibility they
need to meet a national goal of 32 per-
cent reductions in carbon pollution by
2030. This plan was the culmination of
robust and rigorous public participa-
tion, and EPA received millions of
comments supporting the program
from States, through its utilities, com-
munities of color, Tribes, environ-
mental groups, labor unions, and the
public at large.
The Clean Power Plan was not only
good for the environment; it was good
for the economy, too. In Illinois, resi-
dents are expected to save an average
of up to 4 percent on electricity bills by
2030. Illinois energy efficiency invest-
ments alone are estimated to grow our
economy by $2 billion in that same
year, and we lead the Midwest in clean
energy jobs.
But no matter the obvious global, na-
tional, and economic benefits, Mr.
Wheeler has led the administration’s
efforts to roll back the Clean Power
Plan. His replacement proposal would
adversely impact public health and
lead to as many as 1,400 premature
deaths from increased soot, up to 15,000
new cases of upper respiratory prob-
lems, and 100,000 missed school and
work days annually by 2030.
Internationally, this proposal would
leave the United States further behind
our allies that have taken aggressive
action on climate change. The proposal
also fails low-income communities and
communities of color, which bear the
brunt of our environmental and public
health burdens. Unlike the Clean
Power Plan, this platform doesn’t even
require States to engage environ-
mental justice and community groups
in their plan development processes. It
also fails to encourage States to con-
duct environmental justice analysis of
their own as they develop implementa-
tion plans.
EPA should be working to strengthen
policies like the Clean Power Plan. It
is more than troubling that Mr. Wheel-
er and the Trump administration are
instead seeking to repeal them en-
tirely. Now is not the time to move
backward.
Here is what Evan, who grew up in
Libertyville, IL, shared with me:
I write because I am concerned about the
future. The future of the world, the future
for the United States and my own future. At
this time, I feel that perhaps the greatest
threat to that future is climate change. The
current Administration’s stance towards the
issue has discouraged me to no end, and I
can’t help but despair as the President
makes light of this existential threat to the
wellbeing of the planet.
I know, of course, that not all lawmakers
share the President’s stance towards this
issue. Please, make some noise.
Evan, I hear you. I hear your fear,
and I want you to know that I believe
the Nation should be focused on build-
ing a clean energy economy and a cli-
mate-safe future for your generation. I
hear you, and I am going to make that
noise for you.
I am also angry at EPA’s abuse of the
small refinery waiver program under
the renewable fuel standard. The RFS
includes a policy to help small refin-
eries that cannot afford to comply with
the RFS. Before Donald Trump took
power, this policy was rarely used.
Under the Trump administration, how-
ever, nearly every exemption applica-
tion has been secretly granted. This in-
cludes applications from large, multi-
billion dollar companies like Exxon
and Chevron that are earning record
profits. These companies’ CEOs have
even pointed to hardship waivers on
earnings clauses as contributing to
their profitability.
The administration’s stance reduces
incentives for blending—slashing de-
mands for biofuels and feedstocks—ac-
tively hurting farmers and biofuels

companies. These waivers could hurt
the markets for years to come, holding
back homegrown biofuels while cre-
ating windfall profits for large oil re-
finers—the exact opposite of this ad-
ministration’s promise to voters.
Let’s be blunt. EPA is taking money
out of farmers’ hands and giving it to
billionaire oil companies. These ac-
tions come at a time when biofuel pro-
ducers and farmers across our country
are already hurting. Farm income is at
its lowest since 2006, and retaliatory
trade measures from China threaten to
deepen the crisis.
Yet early reports indicate that the
small refinery waivers EPA has grant-
ed under President Trump and Mr.
Wheeler will reduce demand for
biofuels by billions. Over the past 6
months, we have seen more ethanol
plants sold, idled, or closed than ever
before. When I asked Mr. Wheeler dur-
ing the confirmation hearing about
EPA’s apparent change in policy to
now seemingly granting every exemp-
tion application, he made excuses jus-
tifying them. We need a leader at the
EPA who is going to stand up for our
farmers, not capitulate to the demands
of Big Oil.
We also need a leader at the EPA who
is going to protect the Great Lakes.
The 1,000 employees in Region 5 work
tirelessly to protect the environment,
health, and safety of Americans living
in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Min-
nesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. They live,
work, and raise their families in the
communities they protect, and they
are leaders in the fields of water qual-
ity, Superfund cleanup, and Great
Lakes restoration.
Region 5 is also home to the Great
Lakes Program Office, which ensures
that we keep the promises we made to
Canada under the Great Lakes Water
Quality Agreement. It also leads the
Nation’s Great Lakes Restoration Ini-
tiative, which has funded more than
2,000 projects that improve water qual-
ity, protect wildlife, and clean up toxic
pollutants that threaten our water sup-
ply.
To date, the program has invested
more than $2.2 billion in Great Lakes
restoration projects. Coordinated in
both the United States and Canada,
GLRI sets the standards for inter-
agency and international cooperation.
Every $1 invested in Great Lakes res-
toration results in a $2 return in the
form of increased fishing, tourism, and
home values. But in addition to endur-
ing a shutdown, the employees in Re-
gion 5 who lead these programs have
been bought out, undermined, and reor-
ganized into positions they are not
suited for, and that is unacceptable.
What is also unacceptable is Mr.
Wheeler’s attacks on science and
science integrity. Science does not
have a political affiliation. Science is
about learning, and it never stands
still. It gives us the building blocks to
help us increase our knowledge over
time and to find ever-better solutions
to the challenges we face. Unfortu-
nately, this EPA has led the adminis-
tration’s attacks on science when it
doesn’t fit with their pro-polluter agen-
da.
What is at stake is not just our
health and future but also America’s
standing and influence in the world.
Just this month, EPA released the
names of eight new members of its
science advisory board. I am concerned
that several of the new members rep-
resent interests who seek to undermine
the independence and quality of the
scientific advice given to the EPA.
University researchers are now in the
minority on the board, while the num-
ber of industry-affiliated members and
members listed as consultants has in-
creased.
Here is how the Union of Concerned
Scientists summarized the new ap-
pointments made by Wheeler to the
Science Advisory Board. Take Dr. John
Christy. He has a reputation for con-
troversial climate research and deny-
ing the evidence of global warming.
Then, there is Dr. Brant Ulsh, a con-
sultant who argues that radiation at
low doses isn’t a big deal, contrary to
the conclusions of the National Acad-
emy of Science.
New member Dr. Richard Williams
has received compensation from the
American Chemistry Council’s form-
aldehyde panel, which was set up to ob-
fuscate the health impacts of this car-
cinogen. He is also on the board of
trustees of the International Life
Sciences Institute, an industry-funded
organization that is notorious for push-
ing out shoddy nutrition science.
Dr. Barbara Beck is a consultant
with Gradient, which has itself earned
a reputation for helping industry de-
fend their products with favorable sci-
entific studies. Beck herself helped to
write a paper arguing that exposure to
lead at low doses is not necessarily
harmful to children, which is in stark
contrast to the CDC’s assessment that
there is no safe level of exposure to
lead.
The common thread among these in-
dividuals is that they are practitioners
of the widely used disinformation play-
book. They frequently work to inject
uncertainty into science by criticizing
risk assessments and underlying mod-
els. They argue that exposure to pol-
lutants at low doses is not worth wor-
rying about. That is not true. Pollu-
tion is pollution, and it is bad for com-
munities, and it is bad for public
health.
I also want to spend some time dis-
cussing the administration’s new clean
water rule. For more than 45 years, the
Clean Water Act has preserved, pro-
tected, and restored our Nation’s most
important natural resource and radi-
cally transformed how our Nation uses
water. That is why admirers of CWA
appropriately labeled this law as one of
the most successful public health ini-
tiatives ever enacted. Continued suc-
cess of the CWA requires developing a
clear, concise rule for determining
which bodies of water are protected by
the Clean Water Act. However, Mr.
Wheeler and the Trump administration
have proposed a rule that fails to pro-
vide the clear-cut certainty requested
by my constituents. It would cancel
protections for drinking water sources
of tens of millions of people. It would
also cancel protections for streams and
wetlands that provide habitat for wild-
life and protect communities from
flooding.
Communities across the country,
particularly low-income communities
and communities of color, already
struggle to access clean water. Mr.
Wheeler’s proposed rule will make it
even harder for these communities. Mr.
Wheeler’s water rule puts the profits of
corporate polluters before our health
and clean water for our families.
Alan, from Wheeling, IL, wrote to me
and said:
This is insanity. There is nothing more im-
portant than protecting the sources of water
that many people in this country drink from.
No source of drinking water should be open
for pollution or destruction, but that is ex-
actly what this proposal does by stripping
protections from critical streams and wet-
lands across the country.
Senator Duckworth, please do anything
that is possible to protect our environment
and industries that depend upon clean water.
Alan, thank you for writing to me. I
agree with you. This rule makes no sci-
entific, legal, public health, or fiscal
sense.
Another constituent, Dave from
Rockford, shared with me similar con-
cerns. He wrote:
Clean water is not a political issue. Pro-
tecting our watersheds and ensuring that
clean, fresh water is available for fish, farms
and communities is not an option—it’s a re-
sponsibility.
I cannot think of a more enjoyable satis-
faction [than] just standing in a clean river,
seeing all the life teaming in it, and knowing
that our hard work is paying off.
Dave is right. Streams and wetlands
work as natural filters and sponges,
keeping our drinking water supplies
safe, while reducing the impact of
floods.
Like our water, I am concerned by
this administration’s attacks on clean
air. One group that comes to mind that
has been fighting for our clean air is
Mom’s Clean Air Task Force. They are
a group of moms who know how painful
it is when their child can’t play outside
because they have asthma or there is
smog outside. They are fighting for
cleaner air and stronger kids.
They list ten reasons they oppose Mr.
Wheeler, and among those reasons are
his attacks on rules to control mercury
pollution, to make our cars more fuel
efficient, and to reduce smog.
Mr. Wheeler’s attacks on these prior-
ities hits close to home for me. Cur-
rently, the rate of asthma in Illinois is
13 percent higher than the national av-
erage. The Asthma and Allergy Foun-
dation of America ranks Chicago in the
top 10 percent of the most challenging
places to live with asthma. Asthma is
hitting the frontline neighborhoods in
Chicago harder than in many other

places in the Nation, with asthma rates
in some neighborhoods soaring as high
as 33 percent. As the climate gets hot-
ter, air pollution, allergies, and tem-
peratures will trigger more asthma at-
tacks in children.
I want to end on a high note. I com-
mend Mr. Wheeler for following
through on his promise to make him-
self accessible and to conduct proactive
outreach. Compared to Mr. Pruitt, he
is an upgrade in terms of profes-
sionalism, but that is an incredibly low
bar.
At the end of the day, my constitu-
ents are depending on me to protect
them from pollution, even if it upsets
some in industry. I believe we need an
Administrator who is ready to fight for
our kids, to fight for the Great Lakes,
to fight for the civil servants that
work at EPA, and to fight for every
American’s right to clean air, clean
water, and a healthy environment. I
believe EPA will achieve its mission
when it requires rigorous enforcement
when human health is at stake.
Mr. Wheeler believes that public
health must be balanced against the
health of corporations and industry in-
terests who always want less rules, less
oversight, and certainly less enforce-
ment. That is why I must vote no.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
The Senator from Oregon is recog-
nized.
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, this
week the Senate is debating the nomi-
nation of Andrew Wheeler to serve as
Administrator of the U.S. Environ-
mental Protection Agency.
I am going to make this short be-
cause this is bad news for anybody who
wants the Environmental Protection
Agency to live up to its fundamental
mission; that is, to protect the public
health so our citizens, from sea to shin-
ing sea, can breathe clean air and drink
clean water.
In my view, Andrew Wheeler is Scott
Pruitt without an appetite for luxury
travel on the taxpayers’ dime—yet an-
other Trump appointee doing the bid-
ding of the dirtiest, most powerful in-
dustry in America, no matter what
physical harm it might do to the peo-
ple of our country.
To me, the fundamental obligation of
an EPA Administrator should be to
make sure we don’t compromise our
health and the environment. Regret-
tably, Mr. Wheeler has spent his career
doing essentially the opposite.
Given what he has done during his
time as acting head of the Agency, he
has already proven what sort of back-
ward-thinking Administrator he will
be. In fact, I think it would be fair to
say Andrew Wheeler is sure to be ‘‘Ad-
ministrator Rollback.’’
During his time as Acting-Adminis-
trator, he’s rolled back fuel economy
standards that reduce pollution and
help drivers save money at the pump.
Not even the car companies support
him on that. He is rolling back the
rules designed to stop dirty power-
plants from belching toxic gases into
the air. He is rolling back rules de-
signed to protect workers from expo-
sure on the job to dangerous chemicals
that can cause heart attacks, for exam-
ple. He is rolling back EPA enforce-
ment—basic enforcement—of a host of
safeguards that are already on the
books.
Civil penalties against polluters are
now at their lowest since 1994. Inspec-
tions of potentially toxic industrial
sites amount to half of what they were
just in 2010. Civil fines have plummeted
on his watch. Judicial enforcement
cases that have begun and are con-
cluded have been cut in half. The
Wheeler EPA is already letting envi-
ronmental criminals off the hook. It is
my view that these criminals are not
creating victimless crimes—what they
are doing is poisoning our commu-
nities, our workplaces, our air, and our
water.
Perhaps what is most alarming about
his appointment is that he essentially
waves a hand of dismissal to the exis-
tential threat of climate change.
I have a lot of open-to-everybody
townhall meetings in my State. We
have now had more than 920. Just last
week, I held five in different parts of
our State. In counties where Donald
Trump won and in counties where Hil-
lary Clinton won, the issue of climate
change comes up everywhere.
At the root of the questions I get in
communities that span the philo-
sophical spectrum is that people are
terrified—terrified—of what climate
change is going to bring. They see the
news coming out of Washington. They
see that the Trump administration
isn’t just waving the white flag of sur-
render on climate change. In effect, it
almost feels as if the Trump people
want to bring on those climate changes
even faster. Anybody who is walking
around in our communities and sees
temperature shifts of more than 30 or
40 degrees on a dime is completely
aware of what I am talking about, even
if the Trump administration is not.
In my home State, when you talk
about climate change, the first thing
Oregonians think about are wildfires.
These fires are not your grandfather’s
fires. They are bigger. They are hotter.
They are more powerful.
Not too long ago, we actually had a
fire leap the Columbia River—our mag-
nificent Columbia River. This is note-
worthy for a variety reasons but espe-
cially because our rivers historically
have acted as fire bricks. Now we have
these bigger and more powerful fires
almost all year round, not just a few
months in the summer, the way it used
to be. These new megafires are extraor-
dinary.
It is almost as if we are trying to get
acclimated to the idea of clean air ref-
ugees—people who live near areas
where fires break out, with ash built up
on their cars like snow in the winter-
time.
California has seen its own huge in-
fernos causing horrible fatalities in the
last few years. Nevada has seen it, Col-
orado and Washington as well. People
are literally homeless, out and about in
their communities, trying to just find
a safe place for shelter.
Climate change is also not just about
fires. Across the West, there is the
threat of crippling drought. The hurri-
canes that battled the East Coast and
the Gulf of Mexico are intensifying and
drowning our cities with rain. It seems
like every day there is another report
about how sea levels are rising faster
than previously estimated.
Climate change is affecting wildlife
in catastrophic ways. Entire eco-
systems could be lost. This week, there
were reports that an ice sheet larger
than the island of Manhattan broke off
from Antarctica. So the effects of cli-
mate change aren’t some threat way
off in the future. It is already a mas-
sive problem today. Americans feel it,
and they see it in their communities
again and again.
My wife and I are older parents. We
have 11-year-old twins and a 6-year-old
daughter. I—and I am sure there are
plenty of other Senators—think about
what their generation is going to be
dealing with down the road. This is
why there is so much grassroots energy
out there about the Green New Deal,
which I am proud to cosponsor.
I can tell you from the conversations
I had in Oregon, people know what a
grave threat climate change poses.
They want action. My hope is that
there are a variety of ways, like we saw
with the original New Deal, in which
we can find some common ground.
I am the ranking Democrat on the
Senate Finance Committee, which
writes the tax laws. We have more than
40 separate tax breaks for energy that
are on the books today, and most of
them are dirty energy tax relics of yes-
teryear.
What I have proposed is that we basi-
cally throw those 40 energy tax
breaks—relics of dirty energy—in the
trash can and substitute three; one for
clean energy, one for clean transpor-
tation fuel, and one for energy effi-
ciency.
The Presiding Officer is new here.
She is getting out and talking to Sen-
ators about a variety issues. I can tell
her that what I will be saying to col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle is
something like, my idea responds to
what Republicans have been talking
about, the need for fewer subsidies. We
ought to have fewer subsidies for en-
ergy.
Why don’t we try to work together,
find common ground, and do it particu-
larly on an issue that helps us to pro-
mote clean energy at a time of dra-
matic climate change?

That is why I believe Andrew Wheel-
er is the wrong person to lead the EPA.
Just when we need Democrats and Re-
publicans to come together to find
fresh ideas to combat climate change,
he basically says that it really isn’t a
threat at all.
It really isn’t a threat to Mr. Wheel-
er, and he is making the climate
change challenge worse by basically
suppressing the authority and the abil-
ity of the Agency to take this existen-
tial challenge head-on.
The mission of the EPA is all about
protecting human health, fighting for
clean air, fighting for clean water, and
fighting on behalf of Americans from
sea to shining sea.
Andrew Wheeler fights for those who
endanger our health and pollute our air
and water. This isn’t a tough call. I am
a no on a nomination that represents
danger and going backward. I urge my
colleagues to stay with me.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

f
RECOGNIZING THE 150TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
NEBRASKA-LINCOLN
Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I
rise today because in 1869, 150 years
ago, the Nebraska Legislature unani-
mously passed and our Governor signed
legislation that established the Univer-
sity of Nebraska.
The Morrill-Land Grant Colleges Act,
signed into law by President Abraham
Lincoln in 1862, provided Nebraska
with land to establish colleges focused
on agriculture and the mechanic arts.
The university opened its doors in our
State capital, Lincoln, where we honor
President Lincoln’s namesake.
Since then, the University of Ne-
braska-Lincoln has grown to an enroll-
ment of over 25,000 students, providing
over 5,000 new graduates to the work-
force each year and over $2 billion in
annual economic impact for Nebraska
across our 93 counties.
The university holds a special place
in my heart. I am a graduate of the
university. Staying true to its roots,
UNL remains a national leader in
water, agriculture, and rural develop-
ment research, helping to transform
our State, which was once called the
Great American Desert, into one of the
greatest agricultural exporting regions
in the world.
On top of equipping Nebraskans with
the skills to feed the world, the univer-
sity has emerged as a leading institu-
tion for early childhood education and
national security and defense research.
The university’s sports teams unite
our Nebraska communities, and they
fuel our pride in our great State.
Whether it is to cheer on our five-time
national championship winning foot-
ball team at Memorial Stadium or at
the Devaney Center to support one of
our State’s treasures, the five-time na-
tional champion women’s volleyball
team, Lincoln is filled with a sea of
Husker red on game days.
What is more, the University of Ne-
braska-Lincoln leads the Nation with
333 Academic All-Americans across our
Cornhusker sports teams.
The university is also important to
the culture of our State, showcasing
some of the best of the good life—at-
tractions such as the State Museum,
which is the largest natural history
museum in Nebraska or the Larsen
Tractor Test and Power Museum or the
East Campus Dairy Store known across
our State for its wonderful cheese and,
of course, ice cream.
The university, like our State, has
grown and accomplished much over the
last century and a half, and that is why
my colleague from Nebraska and I have
introduced a Senate resolution recog-
nizing UNL’s 150th anniversary on Feb-
ruary 15 of 2019.
This is a formal way for this body to
extend our congratulations to the Uni-
versity of Nebraska-Lincoln on this
special milestone in its history. I urge
my colleagues to support the passage
of the resolution because, as my col-
league and I know so well, there is no
place like Nebraska.
Here is to the next 150 years and be-
yond for the University of Nebraska-
Lincoln.
Madam President, I yield some time
to my colleague from Nebraska so that
he may make remarks on this resolu-
tion as well.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska.
Mr. SASSE. Madam President, I
thank my senior Senator, DEB FISCHER,
for her leadership and drawing atten-
tion to the 150th anniversary of the
University of Nebraska. Senator FISCH-
ER is a tireless champion of our State
and of this special university, her alma
mater.
I am sad to admit in public that I am
not a graduate of the University of Ne-
braska, but I had lied about my age for
many, many years to be able to vend
and sell concessions at Huskers sport-
ing events before I was old enough to
do it so that I could be deeply affiliated
with this institution, even though I
didn’t graduate from there.
I salute my senior Senator and her
leadership in drawing attention to this.
I want to tell stories about Coach
Osborne, who was my boyhood hero,
about crying as a 12-year-old after the
January 2, 1984, national championship
game in Miami, about Scott Frost and
how he is going to soon lead us back to
the promised land, but I have already
been warned by the Presiding Officer
that the Senate has some informal un-
written rules that actually prohibit
football evangelism on the floor.
I will move along to celebrate, with
my senior Senator, our volleyball na-
tional championships, our bowling na-
tional championships, and the fact that
Nebraska is or was once known as the
Great American Desert, and we are
now the most trade-dependent, export-
dependent State per capita in the
Union precisely because we live on the
great Ogallala Aquifer, the most pro-
ductive land anywhere on Earth and at
any point in the history of the Earth.
We grow so much more food than we
can ever conceivably consume that we
feed the world from Nebraska, and a
huge part of that is because of the ag
extension programs of the University
of Nebraska-Lincoln. There are a lot of
great Americans and great patriots
who serve at the University of Ne-
braska on the faculty, in the adminis-
tration, and donors and alumni and our
current students, and the 150th anni-
versary is a great moment for our
State. All 50 States have colleges and
universities they are proud of, but
there is no State that is more identi-

I would like to join my senior Senator

Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I
thank my colleague from Nebraska for
his words and recognizing the impor-
tance of the University of Nebraska to
our State as an economic engine of the
State, as an institution that draws on
the strengths of the State of Nebraska,
and especially looking at Innovation
Campus at the University in Lincoln,
where there is a focus on water and on
food. We are blessed in Nebraska with
that water resource, and we do feed the
world.
Madam President, as in legislative
session, I ask unanimous consent that
the Senate proceed to the consider-
ation of S. Res. 82, submitted earlier
today.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the resolution.
The senior assistant legislative clerk

are having with regard to the nomina-
tion or, I should say, confirmation of
the EPA Administrator.
All of us in this Chamber and the
other body, the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives—frankly, anyone in gov-
ernment—has an obligation to act in
accordance with a goal of being good
stewards of the Earth. Some might call
it creation care—care of God’s cre-
ation.
Unfortunately, the Environmental
Protection Agency, under its current
leadership, is, in my judgment, failing
to meet that obligation. From day one,
the administration has prioritized gut-
ting environmental protections and
rolling back policies that had us on a
path toward a more sustainable future.
From attacking the Clean Power
Plan to weakening methane protection
standards, this administration has re-
peatedly prioritized the interests of
polluters over the health and wellness
of the American people.
Andrew Wheeler, the nominee, if he
is confirmed to run the EPA or, I
should say, the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency, which we call the EPA—
this assault on clean air, clean water,
and so many other protections will
continue if he is, in fact, confirmed.
Some of the most troubling EPA ac-
tions have come while Mr. Wheeler has
been running the EPA in an acting ca-
pacity.
In recent weeks, the EPA has decided
to move forward with a rollback of the
clean car standard and to gut the mer-
cury and air toxics rule. These moves
will harm public health and the health
of our children, in particular.
The American Lung Association re-
ports that 5 Pennsylvania counties, 5 of
our 67 counties, which are home to ap-
proximately 4 million people, rank
among the top 25 counties most pol-
luted by particulate matter year
round.
Rolling back the clean car standards
and clean air standards will cause more
exposure to harmful pollutants that
lead to increased mortality, res-
piratory problems, emergency room
visits, and work-loss days.
As we know, the transportation sec-
tor is the largest source of greenhouse
gas emissions in the United States. We
also know that the MATS rule, the so-
called mercury and air toxics rule, is
an environmental and public health
success story.
Mercury pollution is particularly
harmful for unborn children, who are
much more sensitive to exposure and
who may suffer neurological and devel-
opmental problems.
Powerplant mercury emissions have
declined by 90 percent because of the
MATS rule. This was achieved ahead of
schedule and at one-third of the pro-
jected cost. Let me say that again.
Powerplant mercury emissions have
declined by 90 percent because of the
MATS rule. This was achieved ahead of
schedule and at one-third of the sched-
uled cost.
Let me give testimony from two
Pennsylvanians—partial testimonies,
though they are from longer letters
that they wrote to us.
Mollie Michel of South Philadelphia
wrote to me, and I am quoting her:
As parents, my husband and I spend a lot
of time making sure our daughters are safe
and healthy. We make sure they eat healthy
foods, get enough sleep, do their homework,
and treat each other and their peers with
kindness and respect. But the one thing we
cannot control is the air they breathe. For
that, we rely upon our elected officials to
enact the policies that protect the health
and well-being of my children.
The only thing I would correct in
Mollie’s excerpt of her letter is that it
is the obligation not just of elected of-
ficials but of appointed officials, as
well—those confirmed by the U.S. Sen-
ate, in this case, the Administrator of
the EPA. Of course, it is our duty, as
elected officials, to make sure that we
confirm people who will meet the le-
gitimate expectations of a mom like
Mollie.
Patrice from Gibsonia, PA, wrote to
me to say:
As a mom of two boys, I am deeply con-
cerned by the track record of Acting Admin-
istrator Wheeler. He has spent his time at
EPA proposing and implementing dangerous
rollbacks to and attacks on pollution protec-
tions. He is putting our children’s health and
future at risk.
So said Patrice of Gibsonia.
While we are on the subject of major
threats to the environment, major
threats to our communities, to our
children, and to our families, we can-
not forget about climate change itself.
Climate change is a threat to the
health and well-being of our children
and future generations. We must take
action to address the global climate
crisis with a sense of urgency and de-
termination. The effects of climate
change are real and have become
worse, and unless we take action, we
are going to be in a position where it
will be impossible to take any action if
we do it too late.
We can address the challenge of cli-
mate change and continue to protect
jobs. We can and we must do both. One
is not exclusive of the other. We have
already demonstrated that we can
make advancements in clean energy
and that it can happen quickly while
also benefiting the economy and cre-
ating jobs.
According to the Business Council for
Sustainable Energy and Bloomberg
New Energy Finance, renewables—re-
newable sources of energy—now ac-
count for 18 percent of power genera-
tion in the United States, up from just
9 percent in 2008.
According to the 2018 U.S. Energy
Employment Report, the wind and
solar industries support three times as
many jobs as oil and gas—three times
as many jobs as oil and gas. According
to S&P Global, battery storage cost for
a 20-megawatt facility declined by 40
percent in 2018. So I think it is entirely
possible, and the data proves it, to deal
with this crisis, to meet our obliga-
tions, to continue to create and grow
jobs, and also to make sure that our
economy grows as well.
I live in a State where more than a
generation ago we passed a State Con-
stitution provision. Article I, section 27
of the Pennsylvania Constitution says
in pertinent part that people have a
right to clean air, pure water, and to
the preservation of the natural scenic,
historic, and aesthetic values of the en-
vironment. That constitutional provi-
sion goes on to say that we are trust-
ees. We, the citizens of the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania, are the trust-
ees of our natural resources, and they
specifically talk about future genera-
tions.
That is my obligation, not only as a
citizen of the Commonwealth and not
only as an elected official but, I be-
lieve, as an American as well.
To confront these crises—whether it
is attacks on clean power standards,
clean air and clean water standards or
whether it is the challenge of climate
change itself—we need an EPA and an
EPA Administrator who is totally com-
mitted to that same spirit that is set
forth in that State constitutional pro-
vision that the people have a right to
clean air and clean water, and, I would
argue in a larger sense, the right to the
kind of creation here that is connected
directly to the question of climate
change.
We are talking about God’s creation
and preserving His creation. If we are
trying to preserve God’s creation, we
better make sure we nominate and con-
firm people committed to preserving
creation itself. We are but stewards of
that creation.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

REMEMBERING COLONEL JOE JACKSON AND
LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES KETTLES
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I
would like to take this opportunity to
commemorate two Medal of Honor re-
cipients who passed away last month.
Every Medal of Honor recipient has
served his country with extraordinary
valor and with little or no regard for
his own life and safety.
Air Force Col. Joe Jackson and Army
LTC Charles Kettles were no excep-
tions. They were both pilots and both
served honorably in the Vietnam war.
Both were responsible for extraor-
dinary rescue missions of American
soldiers trapped deep behind enemy
lines against incredible odds. These
two men were patriots who by chance,
skill, and strength of character became
true American heroes. They are gone
now, but their legacies and examples
will always live on. It is up to us to
learn from them.
Col. Joe Jackson passed away on
January 12 at the age of 95.
Jackson enlisted in the Army Air
Corps in 1941, serving as a gunnery in-
structor for the duration of World War

II. But he may never have been a
pilot—may never have been a hero—if
not for a chance event in that war.
One of his friends, a flight engineer,
fell ill right before a B–25 bomber
flight. Jackson agreed to take his
place. During the flight, one of the en-
gines caught fire. The pilot didn’t
know what to do, but Jackson did. His
timely instructions helped extinguish
the fire, possibly saving the aircraft.
Emboldened by this incident, Jackson
decided to become a pilot—and he did,
flying 107 missions as an F–84
Thunderjet pilot during the Korean
war and becoming one of the very first
pilots of the U–2 spy plane.
That in itself would be a pretty dis-
tinguished career of honorable service,
but Joe Jackson returned for more,
decades later. At the age of 45 he an-
swered the call of service once again,
volunteering with the Air Force’s 311th
Air Commando Squadron to fly cargo
planes in Vietnam. It is not often a
cargo pilot gets a chance to distinguish
himself in combat, but it was in that
very role that Joe Jackson earned the
Nation’s highest honor.
May 12, 1968, was supposed to be a
routine cargo mission for Joe Jackson
and the crew of his C–123. That all
changed when the American special
forces camp at Kham Duc was attacked
by the North Vietnamese. As the Viet
Cong overran the camp and established
firing positions just off the landing
strip, an emergency evacuation began
of the much smaller American contin-
gent.
The evacuation quickly turned into a
turkey shoot. Eight aircraft and heli-
copters were shot down or destroyed on
the runway during the desperate evacu-
ation of Kham Duc. In a horrible trag-
edy, one cargo plane was shot down by
North Vietnamese forces shortly after
takeoff. All aboard the aircraft per-
ished—the American air crew, plus
some 150 South Vietnamese civilians.
Eventually, the airlift succeeded in
evacuating nearly all of the camp’s
survivors. But as the last scheduled
plane left the runway and the order
was given to bomb the remainder of the
camp, a horrible discovery was made:
Three American soldiers had acciden-
tally been left on the ground. Joe Jack-
son’s plane was the closest to the area,
so he made a split-second decision.
‘‘We’re going in,’’ he said.
The C–123 cargo plane was not known
for its agility, but Joe Jackson tested
its limits as an aircraft. He banked the
plane into a breathtaking turn and de-
scent, dropping 9,000 feet to the runway
in a matter of seconds. The plane in-
stantly drew fire from the enemy, in-
cluding an anti-armor rocket that
crashed just shy of the aircraft but,
providentially, did not detonate. The
three beleaguered soldiers boarded Joe
Jackson’s aircraft, and he gunned it,
lifting them to safety.
That terrible assault on Kham Duc
exacted a high toll in American lives.
But thanks to Joe Jackson’s quick wits
and skillful flying, that toll was much
lower.
Joe Jackson remained in the Air
Force until 1974, when he retired as a
full colonel. He taught at the Air Force
Air War College so that future pilots
could learn from his example. Then he
worked for Boeing, helping that great
company build airplanes for use in
peacetime, not just wartime. He ulti-
mately settled in Kent, WA, with
Rosamund, his wife, to whom he was
married for 74 years and with whom he
had two children.
Joe Jackson was awarded the Medal
of Honor by President Lyndon Johnson
in January of 1969. He later described
the heavy burden that recipients of
that honor must shoulder. He said:
I have to represent the thousands of Amer-
icans who have served the country. You have
to make them proud of what you have done
and what they have done.
As a former soldier and as an Amer-
ican, let me state that there can be no
finer representative of courage under
fire than Joe Jackson. May he rest in
peace.
LTC Charles Kettles passed away on
January 21 at the age of 89.
Kettles was a helicopter pilot with
the Army’s 176th Assault Helicopter
Company, 14th Combat Aviation Bat-
talion, Task Force Oregon.
Flying was in Kettles’ blood. He was
born in Ypsilanti, MI, to a father who
had flown for the Canadian Royal Air
Force in World War I and later for the
U.S. Army Air Corps in World War II.
Kettles was drafted in 1951, which
began a whirlwind of Active Duty tours
in Korea, Japan, and Thailand. He re-
turned to the armed services in 1963,
volunteering as a pilot. That is one
thing to note about Charles Kettles. He
was always willing to volunteer for
dangerous assignments. Vietnam would
give him many opportunities to volun-
teer.
On May 15, 1967, then-Major Kettles
volunteered to lead a flight of six
Hueys to reinforce the brigade of the
101st Airborne Division that had been
ambushed by a battalion of North Viet-
namese.
The situation was pretty hairy. It
pitted Americans against hundreds of
the VC, and the Americans were taking
heavy fire. Worse still, they were
trapped in little cover in what was
called ‘‘Chump Valley,’’ so nicknamed
because only a chump would go there.
Major Kettles and his team landed
under heavy fire from the enemy. One
of the aviators later recalled that the
tracers were ‘‘like rain . . . coming
straight out of the wood line.’’ So in-
tense was the enemy fire that several
Americans were killed as they ap-
proached the evacuation zone. Never-
theless, Major Kettles stayed until re-
inforcements were offloaded and
wounded soldiers were brought on
board.
After that insertion, Major Kettles
returned to the battlefield a second
time when his helicopter was raked
front to back by machine-gun fire. Me-
chanics later counted 40 holes in his
Huey. Major Kettles’ gunner was seri-
ously wounded in this trip, but Kettles
piloted his aircraft, limping back to
base streaming fuel.
Those two flights would be a full
day’s work and then some for any avi-
ator, but Major Kettles wasn’t done
yet.
Later that day, with the situation in
the valley growing yet more desperate,
Kettles volunteered for a third time to
evacuate the remaining 44 soldiers. So
dangerous was the situation that Ket-
tles was ordered to stand down. How-
ever, he disobeyed that order.
Kettles led six helicopters on a third
landing as fiercely contested by the
enemy as the previous two. Soon the
last helicopter reported all personnel
were evacuated off the ground, and the
helicopters evacuated the area. The all
clear had been given too soon; a small
group of American soldiers who were
bravely fighting a rearguard action had
been left behind.
One of those soldiers later recalled
the feeling when he saw the helicopters
disappear over the jungle canopy: ‘‘If
it’s possible for your heart to fall into
your boots, that’s what mine did.’’
There were now eight Americans
stranded in Chump Valley against hun-
dreds of Viet Cong. Those are long odds
even for the Screaming Eagles of the
101st.
So for the fourth time that day—the
fourth time—in a split-second decision,
Kettles turned around his aircraft to
land in a hot LZ. This time he returned
alone with no gunship support.
When he landed, a mortar exploded
near the front of his aircraft, blowing
out his Huey’s chin bubble, wind-
shields, tail boom, and rotor. His heli-
copter returned with 40 holes and was
600 pounds overweight because all eight
American soldiers were onboard. They
all attribute their survival to his brave
actions.
Kettles was later awarded the Distin-
guished Service Cross for his extraor-
dinary courage and self-sacrifice, but
he wasn’t immediately awarded the
Medal of Honor. There is one thing
Charles Kettles wouldn’t volunteer
for—the spotlight. He accepted the Dis-
tinguished Service Cross and moved on
with his life, retiring from the military
in 1978 after another tour in Vietnam.
Kettles moved back to Michigan,
where he taught aviation management
at Eastern Michigan University and
worked for Chrysler Pentastar Avia-
tion. He married twice and had nine
children, who survive him, along with
his wife Ann.
That is how the Kettles’ story may
have ended if not for a local historian
who persuaded Congress and the Army
to reopen the file. When they did, it be-
came apparent to all that he deserved
the Nation’s highest honor. Charles
Kettles was awarded the Medal of
Honor in 2016 at the young age of 86.
Kettles did what he could to downplay
his role in saving his comrades in arms.
According to him, ‘‘The bottom line of
the whole thing is simply that those 44
[soldiers] did get out of there and are

not a statistic on that wall in DC. The
rest of it is rather immaterial, frank-
ly.’’
Pardon me here if I disagree for once
with Lieutenant Colonel Kettles. It
was due to his bravery that those 44
soldiers returned alive and back to
their families. On the battlefield, valor
is hardly immaterial; it is essential.
Charles Kettles proved that on his four
volunteer rescue flights that fateful
day.
May he rest in peace. May both of
these great warriors rest in peace.

TRIBUTE TO MAURA KEEFE
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I
come to the floor this afternoon with
mixed emotions—mixed emotions be-
cause I feel a tremendous sense of grat-
itude but also sadness because at the
end of this month, tomorrow, after
more than a decade of working to-
gether, my chief of staff, Maura Keefe,
will leave to start a new adventure.
Maura is here on the floor today with
my new chief of staff, Chad
Kreikemeier, and most of our staff here
in DC are in the Gallery watching. Ev-
eryone is here because we think so
much of Maura, and we are so sad that
she is leaving but wish her Godspeed in
everything she does. She has been an
incredible asset as we worked together
to improve the lives of Granite Staters.
I must thank her for her service and
share some of the memories from the
past 10 years. In New Hampshire, where
we are the home of the first primary
State, public service and political en-
gagement are part of our culture. It is
a culture that is epitomized by Maura
and her family.
Maura helped me get elected in 2008.
Actually, she helped me before that—in
2002, when I didn’t win the election. De-
spite our loss, she came back and she
worked with me in 2008, and then when
we won, she set up the office. She had
already accumulated several careers by
that time in political campaigns and
nonprofits and in the private sector. At
each and every step along the way,
Maura made new friendships, and she
blazed a trail of accomplishments. Her
time with us has certainly been no dif-
ferent.
I remember right after that election,
she and a small group of people were
working to set up the office. She
showed me the files of people who were
interested in working on the staff. I
was down here for orientation, and she
and the woman who would become the
deputy chief of staff spent the whole
weekend—while I was running around
doing fun things, they were working
into the night to go through those
résumés to hire the best possible people
to open the office.
Maura’s father, who served as chief of
staff to New Hampshire Senator Tom
McIntyre, whose seat I now hold, would
be very proud of everything she has
done and all of her accomplishments.
I will never be able to thank her
enough for building our wonderful
team, for hiring a staff of dedicated
public servants who work hard for the
people of New Hampshire.
Those of us who have had the pleas-
ure to work with Maura know her sense
of humor. She does great birthday
cards that are very funny. Every
month when we do birthdays in the of-
fice, she does farewell cards that are
sort of testimonials but more roasts—
or equally roast and testimonial. Her
sense of humanity is also what makes
her special. I have certainly benefited
from both of these over the last 10
years.
Maura is going to be missed, not just
in our offices here in Washington and
in New Hampshire but throughout the
Senate because for the last several
years, she has played an important
leadership role among the Democratic
chiefs of staff and among the women
chiefs of staff. She has made a positive
difference for all of our offices, and she
has made important and constructive
inroads with Senate leadership on both
sides of the aisle. Her presence will be
missed by so many people in this insti-
tution.
Of course she is going to be missed
for forging important consensus on the
golf course as well. Our office does a
golf outing every summer, and Maura
is always the one who comes out on top
in those golf outings. She has two holes
in one, and she displays the plaques for
those holes in one on the wall that is
between our two offices. They are a re-
minder that from the Capitol to the tee
box and everywhere in between, Maura
is a fierce competitor.
Over the last 10 years, there have
been real historic moments. I hope
those moments will be the cornerstone
of Maura’s memories from the Senate—
the passage of healthcare reform that
was decades in the making, ushering in
the first bipartisan energy efficiency
legislation in a generation, working to
put a woman on the twenty-dollar bill,
increasing funding and resources to
combat the opioid crisis, expanding
critical investments for the Office on
Violence Against Women, and so many
other critical infrastructure projects,
changes in New Hampshire that have
meant jobs and that have improved the
lives of so many of our citizens.
Perhaps the most succinct descrip-
tion of Maura can be credited to Con-
gresswoman ROSA DELAURO, for whom
Maura worked as chief of staff in the
1990s. Congresswoman DELAURO once
told a reporter aptly that Maura is
‘‘someone who doesn’t mince words.’’ I
can attest to that. When I do things
that she thinks are not quite what I
ought to be doing, she doesn’t mince
words; she lets me have it.
I am going to greatly miss her daily
doses of wisdom and wit. Her sup-
porting counsel has always been in-
valuable to me. I can’t thank her
enough for her dedicated service.
Thank you, Maura. We are all going
to miss you but me, most of all.
Thank you, Madam President.
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF ANDREW WHEELER
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as we
are considering the leadership of the
Environmental Protection Agency, I
think we should pause a moment to
recognize this administration’s record
on the environment—or should I say
the missed opportunities—and what
this administration has done in moving
America in the wrong direction on en-
vironmental protection. This adminis-
tration’s record in dealing with the
greatest challenge we have—global cli-
mate change—is deplorable.
I had the opportunity to lead a dele-
gation of 10 Members of the Senate to
the Paris climate talks in which U.S.
leadership demonstrated our ability to
get universal consensus that climate
change is real, is happening, that it is
primarily caused by the activities we
do here on Earth, and that we can
make a difference in the trajectory of
climate change and the impact it will
have on our lives. If we follow what
science tells us, we can change the
course for the better for future genera-
tions.
I saw in Paris the importance of U.S.
leadership. We had been trying for a
long time to get a global agreement to
deal with this challenge. It wasn’t
until America’s leadership in Paris
that we were able to get a global con-
sensus. In fact, every country in the
world signed on to the Paris Agree-
ment and recognized that every nation
has the responsibility to respond be-
cause what happens in the environment
knows no state boundaries—we are all
in this together.
Then there was the election of Don-
ald Trump as President of the United
States. One of his first actions was to
withdraw America from the Paris cli-
mate agreement. America became the
only Nation in the world not to be part
of the global effort to deal with cli-
mate change.
Our leadership was now going to be
lost, but the Trump administration
didn’t stop there. They have withdrawn
the powerplant rules even though it
was in 2007 that the Supreme Court, in
Massachusetts v. EPA, determined that
carbon dioxide is a dangerous air pol-
lutant and is required to be regulated
by the Environmental Protection
Agency under the clean air rules. Yet
the administration is moving in the
other direction as it relates to clean
air.
They did the same thing with water.
The Supreme Court issued certain deci-
sions in regard to regulated waters. It
required Congress to act. Congress
didn’t act. The administration under
President Obama issued regulations
that were similar to what we had be-
fore the Supreme Court decision, and
now the Trump administration has
withdrawn those regulations as they
relate to clean water.
The list goes on. The Trump adminis-
tration is now backing down on CAFE
standards. That is energy efficiencies

in our automobiles. Maryland is one of
12 States under section 177 that follow
California’s tougher standards. That is
now being jeopardized by the Trump
administration.
As we are considering the leadership
of the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy, we have to recognize that the
Trump administration has moved us in
the wrong direction. We take pride
that with every administration, Con-
gress adds to the protections we have
for clean air and clean water and deal-
ing with our environment. Yet we find
with this President, the opposite is
true. That puts special responsibility
on us in Congress. We have to fill that
vacuum. Yet the Republican leadership
in Congress has made no effort to bring
forward legislation to deal with cli-
mate change. They have not acknowl-
edged that climate change is real. They
have not acknowledged that our activi-
ties here are the primary cause of cli-
mate change. They have not acknowl-
edged that science tells us that if we do
the right thing, we can affect for the
better the impact of climate change in
our communities. All that has been de-
nied by this administration.
What we should do is bring forward
comprehensive legislation to reduce
greenhouse gases. We should put a true
cost on carbon. Let the market forces
help solve the problems we have here.
We should provide for the continued ef-
ficiency of the transportation sector.
We should restore America’s leader-
ship. That is what this Congress should
be considering. Yet under Republican
leadership, we have had no opportunity
to consider comprehensive legislation
in this area.
If we acted, it would be good for our
environment. There is no question
about that. Why should we all be con-
cerned about that? Let me give some
examples from my State of Maryland.
Over the last 50 years, Maryland has
experienced a 70-percent increase in
rainfall. Tell the people of Ellicott
City, who have experienced two 1,000-
year floods in the last 20-month period.
These are floods that they have never
seen before in their lifetime. A large
amount of rain that fell in a very short
period of time caused tremendous dam-
age to the people of Ellicott City. Tell
the 13 million people who are in danger
of being displaced by the end of this
century because of rising sea levels.
Tell the people in the Western United
States whose homes were taken by
wildfires. We need to act. It would be
good for our environment.
I am proud to be one of the Senators
who represent the Chesapeake Bay Wa-
tershed. There are 18 million people
who live in the Chesapeake Bay Water-
shed. We see a rise in the sea level.
This is a vulnerable body of water.
The warming of the Chesapeake Bay
is causing the loss of seagrasses that
are important for the aquatic life. The
salinity of the bay is being diminished
because of more freshwater, and that is
affecting the ecology of the bay. Algae
growths are greater and longer because
of the warm waters. All of that affects
the Chesapeake Bay. If we respond to
climate change, we have a much better
chance of improving the quality of the
Chesapeake Bay, which is critically
important for the way of life for the
people who live in the Chesapeake Bay
Watershed.
It is also, by the way, an important
economic issue. If we do what is right
and respond to climate change, we will
also be helping our economy. The
Chesapeake Bay alone adds $1 trillion
to our economy. A clean bay helps our
economy. Green energy creates jobs—
many more jobs than do traditional
fossil fuels.
It also is good for our national secu-
rity. If we use more of the renewables
and fewer fossil, we as a nation will be
stronger from the point of view of not
being dependent on other countries
that don’t agree with our way of life
for supplying energy needs not only to
us but to our allies around the world—
to the democratic countries around the
world. It makes sense.
As we are considering the future
leadership of the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency, let us recommit our-
selves to recognizing that we have re-
sponsibilities to advance these environ-
mental issues and implore upon the Re-
publican leadership to bring forward
comprehensive legislation that, in fact,
will make a significant difference on
the trajectory of climate change here
in the United States and will restore
America’s global leadership on this
critically important issue.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRAMER). The Senator from Maryland.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I
start by associating myself with the re-
marks of my friend, the senior Senator
from the State of Maryland, Mr.
CARDIN, both with respect to the vital
importance of moving forward on cli-
mate change legislation here in the
Senate and with respect to my opposi-
tion to the nomination of Mr. Wheeler.
I think we need somebody at the head
of the EPA who is going to make the
issue of climate change and other vital
environmental issues a priority.
DECLARATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY
Mr. President, I come to the floor
with respect to another critical issue
facing this Senate right now. I would
just start by noting the fact that ear-
lier this week, in this very Chamber,
the senior Senator from Nebraska, Mrs.
DEB FISCHER, gave the annual reading
of George Washington’s Farewell Ad-
dress, reminding all of us of the advice
that our first President gave our coun-
try upon his resignation. He encour-
aged us to review the words of his fare-
well address frequently as the ‘‘disin-
terested warnings of a parting friend,
who can possibly have no personal mo-
tive to bias his counsel.’’ Those were
the words of George Washington in his
farewell address as he gave us all some
warnings and admonitions.
Maryland is particularly proud of the
fact that President Washington re-
signed his military commission in An-
napolis, in our Old Senate Chamber.
Every year, in the Maryland Senate,
where I once served, we honor Presi-
dent Washington for Presidents Day.
One year, I had the honor of giving the
commemorative address on that occa-
sion, and I appreciate the fact that the
U.S. Senate recognizes the extraor-
dinary farewell address delivered by
our first President. His words of warn-
ing have been prescient throughout
history, from his caution against inter-
nal divisions, including geographic di-
visions between the North and the
South, to the necessity of avoiding for-
eign entanglements that would imperil
our own unity.
At this particular moment in time,
as we reflect on President Washing-
ton’s Farewell Address, we have to do
it in the context of the current Presi-
dent’s extraordinary, unnecessary, and,
I believe, totally unlawful declaration
of emergency powers for the sole pur-
pose of diverting taxpayer money,
which has been previously appropriated
by this Congress, to a different pur-
pose, especially to build a wall along
our southern border. In that context,
we really need to reflect on the words
of our first President and remember
that our Constitution entrusts us,
through article I, as a coequal branch
of government, to do our duty under
the Constitution.
We know the history. We know that
after winning our independence from
England, President Washington, along
with many of our other Founders, was
concerned with the possibility of
authoritarianism and of the critical
need to build checks and balances into
our political system. Here is the key
warning in the farewell address on this
score: ‘‘The habits of thinking in a free
country should inspire caution in those
entrusted with its administration to
confine themselves within their respec-
tive constitutional spheres, avoiding in
the exercise of the powers of one de-
partment to encroach upon another.’’
President Washington argued that
this encroachment of one branch of
government on the constitutional pow-
ers of another is a natural impulse and
one that we must guard against as a
self-governing people because of the
‘‘love of power and proneness to abuse
it,’’ and that is why checks and bal-
ances are necessary to prevent it.
He went on to write:
The necessity of reciprocal checks in the
exercise of political power, by dividing and
distributing it into different depositaries and
constituting each the guardian of the public
weal against invasions by the others, has
been evinced by experiments ancient and
modern, some of them in our country and
under our own eyes. To preserve them must
be as necessary as to institute them.
Now let’s review what just happened
here in our political system in the last
couple of weeks. Just a few weeks ago,
President Trump, after failing to
achieve his desired outcome through
the legislative process, through con-
gressional action, decided that he
would bypass the Congress by declaring

a national emergency in order to redi-
rect funding to build the wall. This is a
textbook example of the kind of power
grab by an executive branch that
George Washington warned us about in
his farewell address.
President Trump is claiming he has
this authority pursuant to the Na-
tional Emergencies Act of 1976, but a
review of the legislative history of the
National Emergencies Act dem-
onstrates that it was passed not to ex-
pand Presidential power but to curb it.
Three years earlier, Congress’s Special
Committee on the Termination of the
National Emergency was created to
end outdated emergency declarations
and, according to the committee’s re-
port at the time, ‘‘recommend ways in
which the United States can meet fu-
ture emergency situations with speed
and effectiveness but without relin-
quishment of congressional oversight
and control.’’ That was what the spe-
cial committee’s report concluded, and
that formed the basis of the legislation
that followed.
The National Emergencies Act gives
the President very, very narrow and
conditioned-based authority to declare
an emergency and specify the steps
necessary to confront it, and it gives
Congress the authority, as we saw in
the House just yesterday, to pass legis-
lation to disapprove of and to termi-
nate the emergency. Of course, it will
also be subject to court review. I would
suggest that it is not our job to pass
laws which we know to be unconstitu-
tional and simply leave it to the courts
to reach the obvious conclusions. We
have a responsibility here in this
Chamber, not only under the Constitu-
tion but under the very statute the
President proposes to use now for his
declaration, to apply our authority and
responsibility as a coequal branch of
government.
Now let’s review the context of this
decision. The President’s interest in
spending billions of dollars of taxpayer
money for a wall along the southern
border was not a secret to Congress. Of
course, during the campaign—as a mat-
ter of his campaign pledges and as he
continues to insist—he did say that at
the end of the day, Mexico will pay for
it. Yet, for the purposes of today, that
is not the main point. The point is that
the President had told this Congress
that it was his intention to try to
spend billions of dollars to build a wall.
His original budget request to the
Congress for the fiscal year that we are
in was $1.6 billion. That was the budget
request we got from the Senate Appro-
priations Committee. Then, last fall
and last winter, in December, the
President began demanding much high-
er amounts for the wall he wants to
build. In fact, in his meeting with then-
Democratic Leader NANCY PELOSI and
Democratic Leader SCHUMER on De-
cember 11, here is what the President
said: If we don’t get what we want, one
way or the other, through you or the
military or anybody else, yes, I will
shut down the government.
That was in December. What the
President was saying was that if he
doesn’t get his appropriations—the
budget request—through the Congress,
he was going to shut down the govern-
ment. He did, and he did that for 35
days. That was his constitutional pre-
rogative not to sign a bill. It, obvi-
ously, caused great harm and disloca-
tion around the country. It caused a lot
of economic pain and a lot of personal
financial pain to millions of Ameri-
cans, but the President clearly had the
authority to do that.
As the Congress, we were aware of
the President’s position. He made it
very clear. Then, after the government
shutdown was over, of course, we
passed that short-term piece of legisla-
tion to keep the government open for 3
weeks as we worked on a longer term
budget plan.
Around February 14 of this year, we
passed a compromise budget bill—a
compromise appropriations bill. That
bill provided $1.375 billion for 55 miles
of pedestrian and levee fencing along
the U.S. border with Mexico. That bill
passed the U.S. Senate by a vote of 83
to 16, and it passed the House of Rep-
resentatives by a vote of 300 to 128. As
with most bills that pass the Congress
with those kinds of bipartisan majori-
ties that are compromises, it didn’t
have everything everyone wanted. It
had some things in it that one side or
the other may not have wanted, but it
was a compromise, and it was made
necessary to pass a bill to keep the
government open. It was to make sure
our constituents received the services
of their government and to make sure
that we met the needs of the country.
On the very morning that we consid-
ered that bill here in the Senate Cham-
ber, President Trump was considering
his next steps. In fact, Majority Leader
MCCONNELL announced on the floor
here that President Trump had told
him that he was going to sign the bill
but that he was also going to sign an
emergency declaration to override the
appropriations in the bill and divert
those moneys to some other purpose
that Congress had not authorized. In
fact, while Senator MCCONNELL was
making that statement at the time we
were considering and voting on the bill,
it was not a surprise that the President
had been considering it. He had been
talking for weeks and threatening the
Congress that if he didn’t get the ap-
propriations levels he wanted for the
wall—if he didn’t get the budget alloca-
tion he wanted—he was just going to
declare a national emergency and do it
himself. That was his threat.
Clearly, he hoped that threat would
force Congress to provide the extra
moneys the President requested for the
wall, but the Congress didn’t do the
President’s bidding. We passed that
compromise bill by those large bipar-
tisan majorities. So what did the Presi-
dent do? Of course, he declared this
emergency.
I should note that even as he an-
nounced his emergency declaration in
the Rose Garden, the President said: ‘‘I
could do the wall over a longer period
of time. I didn’t need to do this . . . but
I’d rather do it much faster.’’ That is
what the President said at the time. He
said he didn’t need to do this, not in
that way, but he wanted to do this
quickly.
Here is the thing. He didn’t need to
do it. He made it very clear that he de-
cided to do it simply because he didn’t
get what he wanted from the U.S. Con-
gress; that because we didn’t do what
the President—what the Executive
asked, heck, he was going to declare
some emergency to divert money from
areas the Congress had approved on a
bipartisan basis to some other area the
President wanted to spend money on,
in this case the wall.
Now, look, the Constitution is pretty
clear. The President had the power to
veto that bill. He, of course, had re-
fused to go along with an earlier pro-
posal, and that led to a 3-week govern-
ment shutdown. The President could
have done that again. That would have
been in his power to do it, and of
course the choice for the Congress at
that point would have been whether to
override the President’s veto.
If you look at the size of the votes
that appropriations bill passed by—83
to 16 in the U.S. Senate and 300 to 128
in the House—he could have overridden
the veto. That would have been the
constitutional way for the President of
the United States to try to get his way,
but that is not what he did. He decided
to do something different, declare an
emergency in an unconstitutional way.
The question we have to ask our-
selves—and I am talking Republicans
and Democrats, and I am talking about
the Senate as an institution, the House
of Representatives as an institution—is
should this President or any other
President—or any other President—be
able to override an appropriations law
to the tune of billions of dollars right
after Congress has already expressed
its position in a bill that we passed by
overwhelming majorities or by any ma-
jority, a bill that passed.
In declaring this alleged emergency,
the President has announced his inten-
tion to divert $2.6 billion from the De-
partment of Defense counterdrug ac-
tivities. This is an ironic diversion,
considering the President’s stated con-
cern, which I share, about drug traf-
ficking.
The Defense Department has indi-
cated that those moneys the President
is proposing to take from drug traf-
ficking are being spent for that purpose
and that only about $85 million re-
mains in that account. So that means
they are going to have to take other
moneys from other Defense Depart-
ment priorities, and the President has
indicated they want to take $3.6 billion
from military construction accounts—
moneys that this Congress, on a bipar-
tisan basis, has already appropriated
for those military construction
projects.
Article I is crystal clear. Article I of
the Constitution vests this Congress—

February 27, 2019
this Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives—with the power of the
purse.
I have my handy, small Constitution
right here, and I would just again like
to remind our colleagues that it says:
‘‘No money shall be drawn from the
Treasury, but in Consequence of Appro-
priations made by Law, and a regular
statement and account of the receipts
and expenditures of all public money
shall be published from time to time.’’
So article I of the Constitution is
very clear. It is the U.S. Congress that
has the power of the purse and has the
authority to direct taxpayer moneys to
the priorities that we decide.
I ask my colleagues whether they are
prepared to relinquish that authority.
In fact, I would make the point it is
really not ours to relinquish because
the Constitution is quite clear on this
point.
We all know that yesterday the
House of Representatives took a vote
to say the President is not able to use
the particular law he used the other
day to declare an emergency. This Sen-
ate is going to be voting on that soon,
and we have to ask ourselves as Sen-
ators what kind of precedent we want
to set.
Do we want to adhere to our duties
under the Constitution? Should any
President be able to say, ‘‘Oh, my good-
ness. I don’t like what the Congress
just did. I don’t like the fact that the
Congress, through their duly elected
Representatives and duly elected Sen-
ators, didn’t give me all the money I
wanted for the wall, and so I am going
to throw the Constitution out, and I
am going to take money that the Con-
gress proposed for one purpose, and I
am just going to move it somewhere
else’’?
I want my colleagues to think really
carefully about the precedent we would
be establishing if we allow that action
to go unchecked.
We were just having a conversation
here on the floor, my colleague from
the State of Maryland and others,
about the dangers and risks of climate
change. That is a real crisis. I believe
we should be investing a lot more funds
in building out our clean energy infra-
structure.
We may well have a future President,
maybe sooner rather than later, who
wants to do that. I just ask my col-
leagues whether they think that Presi-
dent should be able to declare a na-
tional emergency and spend money for
that purpose even if this Congress has
not appropriated the moneys for that
purpose.
The idea that the President of the
United States—any President of the
United States—is going to declare an
emergency simply because he or she
did not get the appropriations request
they asked for is unprecedented. We
have looked. There have been times
when people have declared emer-
gencies, but we were not able to find
any time where we have a situation
like this, where a President, who tried
to get a certain appropriation for a cer-
tain purpose out of Congress, didn’t get
it and immediately turned around and
asked for a national emergency to do
what the Congress had just denied
them the authority to do.
Just this morning President Trump’s
adviser, Kellyanne Conway, was on
‘‘FOX & Friends’’ and said the Presi-
dent had to act because Congress
didn’t. In other words, the President
had to act because Congress, on a bi-
partisan basis, through its duly elected
representatives, did not give the Presi-
dent of the United States, the Execu-
tive, what the Executive asked for.
That is why the President gets to de-
clare an emergency.
That would create a lawless situation
and a gross violation of our Constitu-
tion.
She went on to say: ‘‘It’s failed to do
its job since he has been President on
securing the border, and it has failed to
do its job for decades, and so he waited
for them.’’ In other words, because the
President is dissatisfied with what the
Congress did, he gets to tear up the
Constitution and go his own way.
Back in 1983, when President Reagan
was frustrated with the Congress and
its control of the budget, he received a
letter urging him to declare a state of
emergency over our Nation’s finances.
In response, President Reagan ac-
knowledged his frustration but wrote:
‘‘I don’t believe the President has the
power to declare an emergency short of
war.’’
I urge my colleagues—I urge my col-
leagues—to be cautious in allowing any
President to use or claim an emergency
in order to undercut the clear division
of power set forth in the Constitution
between the legislative and the execu-
tive branch.
Yesterday Leader MCCONNELL was
asked about the legality of President
Trump’s move, and the majority leader
acknowledged he ‘‘hadn’t reached a
total conclusion’’ on whether President
Trump is acting legally.
Think about that. You have the ma-
jority leader acknowledging that the
President may be acting unlawfully. I
think it is pretty clear on its face for
those who closely examine the Con-
stitution and the power of the purse.
I think we are all called upon not as
Republicans or Democrats but as
Americans and as Senators in this
Chamber to do our job and reject what
is clearly an unconstitutional power
grab. We should not passively submit
to these actions. We should think
about what we are going to do in light
of the precedent that is being set here,
and I hope we will do our jobs.
I will just close with another state-
ment from President Washington’s
Farewell Address where he cautioned
against allowing any one branch of
government to claim excessive power,
even with the best of motivations. ‘‘Let
there be no change by usurpation; for
though this, in one instance, may be
the instrument of good, it is the cus-
tomary weapon by which free govern-
ments are destroyed.’’
In my view, the President’s actions
are not for the good, but I know many
of my Republican colleagues would
agree with the ends the President seeks
with respect to using more moneys to
build a wall. I understand that is the
position of our Republican colleagues,
but what George Washington warned us
about was—whether we like what the
President is doing or don’t like what
the President is doing—if the President
is diverting money away from the pur-
poses this Senate and the House of
Representatives directed to some other
purpose this President or any other
President may want that we have not
authorized, that is a gross usurpation
of power, and we should not allow it to
happen.
So I ask my colleagues, let’s join to-
gether to do the business of the Senate,
protect the Constitution, and do our
jobs.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico.
NOMINATION OF ANDREW WHEELER
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I would
associate myself with the comments of
Senator VAN HOLLEN, who I think hit
the nail on the head when it comes to
this overreach by the President.
I rise in support of the growing calls
for action on climate change that are
echoing in every corner of this Nation.
The science is overwhelming, the evi-
dence is clear, and unless we take im-
mediate action, we will lose our planet
as we know it. There is nowhere that
has more at stake than my home State
of New Mexico and the Southwest,
which are in the bullseye of global
warming. Unless we act against green-
house gas pollution, rising tempera-
tures, drought, wildfires, deforestation,
we will permanently harm our commu-
nities.
Because I believe in climate science
and because I believe we desperately
need to act, I must strongly oppose the
confirmation of Andrew Wheeler to
lead our Nation’s Environmental Pro-
tection Agency. Mr. Wheeler has con-
sistently advocated for measures that
would damage the environment, hurt
public health, and do long-term injury
to the economy, and his record on cli-
mate change and the record of his ad-
ministration are simply disqualifying.
Mr. Wheeler’s nomination is among
the worst in a long line of backward
nominations by this President. For
someone who wants to lead the EPA—
the key word being ‘‘protection’’—Mr.
Wheeler’s priorities are upside down.
Let’s be blunt with the American
people. Mr. Wheeler was not nominated
to protect the environment and human
health. He was nominated to unravel
and undo the environmental protec-
tions that are now in place. He was
nominated to stop any new environ-
mental and public health protections
from being initiated. He was nominated
to go easy on those who violate exist-
ing environmental laws. He was nomi-
nated to stand in the way of climate
science and climate action.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1534 February 27, 2019
So far, by these measures, he has
been a great success for a President
who mocks climate science and who de-
nies that this existential threat even
exists, but there is no success for the
American people. Mr. Wheeler’s nomi-
nation puts the American public at
great risk, and we should firmly oppose
making his appointment permanent.
Unfortunately, Mr. Wheeler’s upside-
down priorities don’t end at climate
change. In addition to actively resist-
ing climate action, Mr. Wheeler is not
looking out for the health and well-
being of my constituents or protecting
my State’s most precious resource, our
water. There, like in so many other
parts of the country, fire foam used by
the Air Force has contaminated
groundwater with toxic chemicals
known as PFAS. These chemicals are
linked to various cancers, heart dis-
ease, and other ailments. Groundwater
in and around Cannon Air Force Base,
near Clovis, NM, is contaminated with
PFAS.
This is dairy country. One dairy is
actually being put out of business be-
cause the PFAS is in groundwater and
it has contaminated this farmer’s
water wells. The family that owns the
dairy and its hard-working employees
have drank water from these wells for
years.
Will a Wheeler EPA put us in this sit-
uation? Will they help us out of it?
During his confirmation hearings, he
refused to commit to setting a drink-
ing water standard. Then, later, we
find out that he had already decided
not to set standards for these toxic
chemicals in December of last year.
Under bipartisan pressure, he has since
backed down and says EPA will set a
standard—someday. I wouldn’t hold my
breath. In the meantime, millions of
Americans and the dairies in eastern
New Mexico are being hurt.
Furthermore, Mr. Wheeler is a com-
mitted soldier in the long-running as-
sault on science that President Trump
has championed. One of my constitu-
ents, Celerah Hewes, wrote this week
asking me to vote against this nomina-
tion. She writes:
I grew up in Corrales, surrounded by farm-
land and fresh air. I remember when the Rio
Grande was full of water and the ditches in
the bosque flowed freely.
Climate change and drought have forever
changed the land I call home and my daugh-
ter will not remember a time without severe
fire danger and ozone pollution.
Celerah wants me to vote no because
Mr. Wheeler ‘‘is putting our children’s
health and future at risk.’’
According to the 2018 ‘‘Fourth Na-
tional Climate Assessment,’’ we have
12 years to turn this around for
Celerah, her daughter, and the world.
Soon, the impacts will become irre-
versible.
The previous EPA set rules to reduce
carbon pollution from powerplants by
32 percent by 2030. Mr. Wheeler’s new
plan will allow increased emissions
from fossil fuel plants instead.
He is no better when it comes to even
modest standards for methane waste
from oil and gas operations. Methane is
an extremely potent greenhouse gas, 84
times more potent than carbon dioxide
over the initial 20-year period. EPA’s
prior methane rules would have cut
back methane pollution in a cost-effec-
tive way. Those regulations are out the
window under Mr. Wheeler and re-
placed with loose rules, adding hun-
dreds of thousands of tons of methane,
volatile organic compounds, and toxins
into the air.
Climate change is the most signifi-
cant threat facing our planet. The EPA
is the Agency that should be leading
the charge on tackling this threat, but
Mr. Wheeler is a former lobbyist for
the coal industry. Like so many other
nominations, the President has again
put the fox in charge of the henhouse.
This time, the consequences could be
disastrous and irreversible for our
country and our planet. If we vote to
confirm him, there will be little, if
any, hope for climate action for the
next 2 years.
Mr. Wheeler leaves no doubt whose
side he is on. His record shows that,
under his watch, big polluters will get
off scot-free.
Companies that pollute often try to
reduce their cost of business and in-
crease their profits by dumping that
pollution and its costs on society as a
whole. When environmental officials
fail to enforce the rules against pol-
luters, bad actors get an unfair advan-
tage. Lax environmental enforcement
is bad for American businesses that do
the right thing and bad for taxpayers,
who get stuck with the cleanup bills.
Sadly, Mr. Wheeler’s EPA is the post-
er child for lax enforcement. In 2018,
EPA collected the smallest amount of
civil penalties against polluters since
1994. Inspections are half of what they
were in 2010. EPA charged the fewest
criminal defendants since 1991. It saw a
steep drop in civil judicial enforcement
cases as well. The bad news goes on and
on.
So the best that can be said of Mr.
Wheeler’s record is that he is not Scott
Pruitt. As far as we know, he has not
abused taxpayer funds or staff for a va-
riety of luxurious perks or rented his
house from a lobbyist. But the bar is so
low that it is in the Capitol basement.
Indeed, I believe that the EPA under
this President has reached an all-time
low. There is hardly even any pretense
that their goal is to safeguard the envi-
ronment and public health. They are
actively damaging our environment
and actively resisting action on cli-
mate change at a time when young
people and so many others across New
Mexico and this country are crying out
for action. We simply must do better.
So I will vote no, and I will urge my
colleagues to consider the con-
sequences of this nomination for their
children, grandchildren, and beyond,
and to vote no as well.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The legislative clerk proceeded to
call the roll.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.

BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to
submit to the Senate the budget
scorekeeping report for February 2019.
The report compares current-law levels
of spending and revenues with the
amounts the Senate agreed to in the
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, BBA18.
This information is necessary for the
Senate Budget Committee to deter-
mine whether budgetary points of
order lie against pending legislation.
The Republican staff of the Budget
Committee and the Congressional
Budget Office, CBO, prepared this re-
port pursuant to section 308(b) of the
Congressional Budget Act, CBA.
This is my second scorekeeping re-
port this year. My last filing can be
found in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD for
January 10, 2019. The information in-
cluded in this report is current through
February 25, 2019.
Since my last filing, two bills with
significant budgetary effects cleared
Congress, the Medicaid Extenders Act
of 2019, P.L. 116–3, and the Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2019, P.L. 116–6.
Budget Committee Republican staff
prepared Tables 1–3.
Table 1 gives the amount by which
each Senate authorizing committee ex-
ceeds or is below its allocation for
budget authority and outlays under the
most recently adopted budget resolu-
tion and the fiscal year 2019 enforce-
able levels filing. This information is
used for enforcing committee alloca-
tions pursuant to section 302 of the
CBA. Over the current 10-year enforce-
able window, authorizing committees
have increased outlays by a combined
$3.4 billion. For this reporting period,
as in my last report, 8 of the 16 author-
izing committees are not in compliance
with their allocations. Two of these
committees, Finance and Judiciary,
further exacerbated their violations
during this work period with the pas-
sage of Medicaid Extenders and the au-
thorizing division, Division H, of the
final 2019 appropriations bill, respec-
tively. For the Finance Committee,
P.L. 116–3 was estimated to increase
budget authority over each enforceable
period for its allocation, with the larg-
est violation, $120 million, occurring in
2019. For the Judiciary Committee, Di-
vision H of P.L. 116–6, which included
various immigration extenders, was es-
timated to increase budget authority
and outlays by $30 million over the
next 10 years.
Table 2 provides the amount by
which the Senate Committee on Appro-
priations is below or exceeds the statu-
tory spending limits. This information
is used to determine points of order re-
lated to the spending caps found in sec-
tions 312 and 314 of the CBA. Appropria-
tions for fiscal year 2019, displayed in
this table, show that the Appropria-
tions Committee is compliant with
spending limits for fiscal year 2019.
Those limits for regular discretionary
spending are $647 billion for accounts
in the defense category and $597 billion
for accounts in the nondefense cat-
egory of spending.
The fiscal year 2018 budget resolution
contained points of order limiting the
use of changes in mandatory programs
in appropriations bills, CHIMPs. Table
3, which tracks the CHIMP limit of $15
billion for fiscal year 2019, shows the
Appropriations Committee has enacted
$15 billion worth of full-year CHIMPs
for fiscal year 2019. The fiscal year 2019
CHIMPs were contained in the Labor,
Health and Human Services, Education
and Related Agencies division of P.L.
115–245 and the Commerce, Justice,
Science, and Related Agencies division
of P.L. 116–6. This information is used
for determining the point of order
under section 4102, overall limit, of H.
Con. Res. 71, 115th Congress.
In addition to the tables provided by
Budget Committee Republican staff, I
am submitting CBO tables, which I will
use to enforce budget totals approved
by Congress.
For fiscal year 2019, CBO estimates
that current-law levels are $2.8 billion
above and $3.3 billion below enforceable
levels for budget authority and out-
lays, respectively. Revenues are $426
million below the level assumed in the
budget resolution. Further, Social Se-
curity revenues are at the levels as-
sumed for fiscal year 2019, while Social
Security outlays are $4 million above
assumed levels for the budget year.
CBO’s report also provides informa-
tion needed to enforce the Senate pay-
as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The PAYGO
scorecard shows deficit increases in fis-
cal year 2019 of $1,930 million—$427 mil-
lion revenue loss, $1,503 million outlay
increase—over the fiscal year 2018–2023
period of $3,337 million—$894 million
revenue loss, $2,443 million outlay in-
crease—and over the fiscal year 2018–
2028 period of $425 million—$634 million
revenue loss, $209 million outlay de-
crease. During this work period, one
bill, the Consolidated Appropriations
Act, 2019, included a statutory exemp-
tion for the budgetary effects of its Di-
vision H from the Senate’s PAYGO
scorecard. The Senate’s PAYGO rule is
enforced by section 4106 of H. Con. Res.
71, 115th Congress.
This submission also includes a table
tracking the Senate’s budget enforce-
ment activity on the floor since the en-
forcement filing on May 7, 2018. Since
my last report, no new budgetary
points of order were raised.
All years in the accompanying tables
are fiscal years.
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables be printed in the
RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:

n.a. = not applicable; P.L. = Public Law.
a. Sections 1001–1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255) require that certain funding provided for 2017 through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services—in particular the Food and Drug Administration and
the National Institutes of Health—be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) or the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974
(Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include $771 million in budget authority, and $767 million in estimated outlays.
b. For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as approved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, current
level does not include those items.
c. Pursuant to section 232(b) of H.C. Res. 290 (106th Congress), the Concurrent Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2001, the budgetary effects related to the Federal Reserve’s surplus funds are excluded. As a result, the amounts shown
do not include estimated increases in revenues of $655 million in fiscal year 2019, $570 million over the 2019–2023 period, and $454 million over the 2019–2028 period.
d. Division I of P.L. 115–254 provided $1.68 billion in supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2019, and designated those amounts as being for emergency requirements pursuant to section 251 of the Deficit Control Act. In general,
the budgetary effects of authorizing legislation are recorded as direct spending or revenue. However, consistent with the language in Division I, and at the direction of the Senate Committee on the Budget, those budgetary effects are clas-
sified as discretionary spending.
e. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116–5), as amended, extended several immigration programs through February 15, 2019, that would otherwise have expired at the end of fiscal year 2018. The estimated budgetary ef-
fects of those previously enacted extensions are charged to the Committee on Appropriations, and are included in the budgetary effects of P.L. 116–6 shown in the ‘‘Appropriation Legislation’’ portion of this report. In addition, division H of
P.L. 116–6 further extended those same programs through the end of fiscal year 2019. Consistent with the language in title III of division H of P.L. 116–6, and at the direction of the Senate Committee on the Budget, the budgetary ef-
fects of extending those immigration programs for the remainder of the fiscal year are charged to the relevant authorizing committees, and are shown in the ‘‘Authorizing Legislation’’ portion of this report.
f. Section 30103 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 required—in the absence of a concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2019—that the Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget publish the aggregate spending
and revenue levels for fiscal year 2019; those aggregate levels were first published in the Congressional Record on May 7, 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also allows the Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget to revise
the budgetary aggregates:

S1538 February 27, 2019
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
REMEMBERING PARKER GREENE
∑ Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, today I
wish to recognize a great loss suffered
in my home State of Georgia and more
specifically in the city of Valdosta. For
more than 40 years, Parker Greene
spent every day of his life thinking
about how he could make a difference
in his community by supporting the
various missions at Moody Air Force
Base, which is located just on the out-
skirts of Valdosta in South Georgia.
Parker passed away on December 18,
2018, at the age of 86. He leaves behind
a lasting legacy that will be remem-
bered throughout my home State for
decades to come.
Parker moved to Valdosta in 1970 and
immediately became involved with the
Valdosta-Lowndes County Chamber of
Commerce. He was named to the mili-
tary affairs committee and quickly de-
veloped a fondness for the airmen sta-
tioned at Moody, as well as the mul-
tiple missions housed at the base.
Through the years, his level of advo-
cacy for Moody continued to increase.
The local community recognized this
and created the Moody Support Com-
mittee and named Parker as its chair-
man. As chairman, Parker took count-
less trips every year to Washington,
DC, to impress upon congressional and
Department of Defense leaders the im-
portance of maintaining a robust Air
Force presence at Moody due to its
strategic location in the southeastern
U.S. and unmatched community sup-
port.
In the 1990s, when the Base Realign-
ment and Closure Commission rec-
ommended closing Moody and moving
its missions to other bases, Parker and
the Moody Support Committee tire-
lessly walked the halls of Congress and
the Pentagon to advocate for the re-
moval of Moody from the BRAC list
and to increase its mission presence.
Parker’s efforts proved successful. His
determination allowed Moody to con-
tinue its mission, while sparing the
Valdosta community from certain eco-
nomic loss due to the closure of the
base.
Following his successful efforts in
the 1990s, Parker continued his work on
Moody’s behalf to relocate new mis-
sions to the base in order to diversify
Moody’s mission presence and further
prove its strategic importance. In fact,
in 2007, the newly constructed consoli-
dated base support center at Moody
was named after Parker because of his
efforts on behalf of the base and its air-
men. Former Air Force Chief of Staff
Michael Moseley was at the renaming
and presented Parker with the first-
ever Chief of Staff Exceptional Service
Award.
Several years later, Parker was
awarded the highest honor the Air
Force can bestow on a civilian: the Air
Force Distinguished Public Service
Award. The award stated that Parker
‘‘distinguished himself by service as an
Air Force advocate, with both an inti-
mate knowledge of Air Force oper-
ations and a deep grasp of social and
economic issues vital to Moody Air
Force Base. He has expertly advised
the Secretary of the Air Force, the
Chief of Staff, and senior Air Force
leaders on these matters while serving
as an Air Force civic leader to the com-
munity surrounding the installation.’’
Of course, Parker could not have ac-
complished his many feats without the
loyal and steadfast support from his
lovely wife Dr. Lucy Greene. Together,
they made an unstoppable duo, and
Lucy proved to be as tireless an advo-
cate for Moody as Parker. I know I
speak for the entire State when I offer
my heartfelt condolences to Lucy and
their two children, Buck and Sharon.
While we mourn Parker and the loss
to Moody AFB and south Georgia, I
know that everyone can look at Park-
er’s record of achievement and see an
unparalleled legacy of selflessness,
kindness, and service to others. I have
no doubt that Moody will continue to
be a leading example of Air Force ex-
cellence because of Parker’s impact on
the base and his advocacy for the re-
gion in Atlanta and Washington.∑

REMEMBERING NORMAN W.
DESCHAMPE
∑ Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, I would
like to acknowledge the contributions
and legacy of Norman W. Deschampe,
the longtime chairman of the Grand
Portage Band of the Lake Superior
Chippewa, who recently passed away on
February 9, 2019.
Norman Deschampe was born on Feb-
ruary 26, 1953, and lived with a commit-
ment to improving the lives of the peo-
ple of the Grand Portage Band of Lake
Superior Chippewa. For more than 40
years, Norman Deschampe served the
people of the Grand Portage Band, first
as a Tribal council member and later
as secretary-treasurer and, for 27 years,
as chairman. He also served for 6 years
as vice president and 22 years as presi-
dent of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe.
Norman Deschampe’s legacy includes
a longstanding commitment to sup-
porting the health, education, and eco-
nomic development of the Grand Por-
tage Band. He promoted environmental
stewardship and fostered relationships
with local, State, and Federal govern-
ments to encourage conservation on
the reservation and beyond. Norman
Deschampe encouraged the apprecia-
tion and preservation of the traditions
and customs of the Grand Portage
Band and is remembered by many for
his kindness and generosity.
Norman Deschampe made a lasting
contribution to the Grand Portage
Band and the State of Minnesota, and I
am proud to recognize his legacy as
Minnesota celebrated Norman
Deschampe Day on Tuesday, February
26, 2019.∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1542 February 27, 2019
Courts, an estimated 1.3 million adults
are under the care of guardians—family
members or professionals—who control
approximately $50 billion of their as-
sets. Guardianship is a legal relation-
ship created by a court that is designed
to protect those with diminished or
lost capacity. We found, however, that
in some cases, the system lacks basic
protections against inappropriate use
of guardianship and abuse by those in
power, leaving the most vulnerable
Americans at risk of exploitation.
In November 2018, the Aging Com-
mittee released a bipartisan report fol-
lowing a year-long investigation into
State guardianship programs. Titled,
‘‘Ensuring Trust: Strengthening State
Efforts to Overhaul the Guardianship
Process and Protect Older Americans,’’
the report included a number of rec-
ommendations intended to help stem
the wave of guardianship abuse, en-
courage reforms to State systems and
restore trust in guardianship arrange-
ments.
Throughout the course of our inves-
tigation, we heard harrowing tales
from families around the Nation who
have struggled with abusive guardians,
unscrupulous individuals exploiting
vulnerable Americans for their per-
sonal profit. Yet we also spoke with
families who had heartening stories to
share—of dedicated and faithful guard-
ians stepping up to protect the assets
of seniors with dementia and other
conditions affecting their capacity. A
good guardian can provide years of sup-
port for a protected individual, ensur-
ing a full life directed, wherever pos-
sible, by the person’s own choices and
preferences. Once a guardianship is im-
posed, however, the individual’s rights
are removed, and oversight to protect
the individual from abuse, neglect and
exploitation becomes critical.
Our Committee gathered informa-
tion, analysis and recommendations
from States, courts, and organizations
representing older Americans and
those with disabilities around the
country. We found signs of progress in
a number of jurisdictions. For example,
in 2017, Maine was the first state to
enact the Uniform Law Commission’s
Uniform Guardianship, Conservator-
ship, and Other Protective Arrange-
ments Act. Among the reforms made to
Maine’s guardianship system, this leg-
islation highlighted the importance of
exploring all options to limit or pre-
clude the need for guardianship when
appropriate, including the use of sup-
ported decision making. Maine’s law
also mandates the regular review of re-
ports filed by guardians to determine,
among other things, whether the
guardianship should continue and
whether the guardian has complied
with his or her duties.
Yet stories in the news continue to
call our attention to this important
issue. Appalling stories, such as that of
a guardian from Nevada who allegedly
used the guardianship process to finan-
cially exploit more than 150 individ-
uals, and that of another guardian
from North Carolina who, along with
an attorney, an advocate, and a pro-
fessor, took advantage of two men
under guardianship and allegedly stole
hundreds of thousands of dollars, re-
mind us of the vulnerabilities created
by these relationships and the need for
diligent oversight.
In the course of the Committee’s in-
vestigation, we received more than 100
comments identifying gaps in the sys-
tem and, most important, offering so-
lutions. The Committee found a pat-
tern of barriers to proper oversight and
a need for greater use of alternatives to
guardianship. We found persistent and
widespread challenges that require a
nationwide focus in order to ensure the
guardianship system works on behalf of
the individuals it is intended to pro-
tect. The Committee’s report outlines
policy recommendations at local, state
and federal levels that would improve
outcomes for Americans subject to
guardianship.
The Guardianship Accountability
Act, which we are introducing today,
addresses many of the report’s rec-
ommendations. The bill would direct
the Elder Justice Coordinating Council
to establish a National Online Re-
source Center on Guardianship to col-
lect and publish information relevant
to guardianship for use by guardians,
individuals subject to guardianship, as
well as courts, states, local govern-
ments, and community organizations.
The resource center would also publish
model legislation and best practices de-
veloped pursuant to the Elder Abuse
Prevention and Prosecution Act, com-
pile and publish training materials for
guardians, share research related to
guardianship, and maintain a database
on state laws regarding guardianship
and the use of less restrictive alter-
natives. In addition, our legislation
would also expand the availability of
federal demonstration grants estab-
lished by the Elder Justice Act, so
funds can be used for developing state
guardianship databases, for training
for court visitors, and for sharing in-
formation on guardian background
checks.
Combating financial abuse and ex-
ploitation of seniors requires law en-
forcement and social service agencies
at all levels of government to work to-
gether, and the bipartisan Guardian-
ship Accountability Act promotes this
kind of collaboration. I urge my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan leg-
islation.

lators;
Whereas Boris Nemtsov was co-chairman
of a leading opposition party, won election
to the Yaroslavl Regional Duma in 2013, and

Novaya Gazeta newspaper on December 9,
2016, operatives of the Federal Security Serv-

Ruslan Geremeyev’s driver, Ruslan
Mukhudinov, who is named alongside ‘‘other
unidentified persons’’;

the Russian Federation and the Moscow Dis-
trict Military Court have refused to classify

ing to political motives behind the assas-
sination;

and Ms. COLLINS) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to:
S. RES. 83
Whereas cardiovascular disease affects
men, women, and children of every age and
race in the United States;
Whereas, between 2003 and 2013, the death
rate from cardiovascular disease fell nearly
30 percent, but cardiovascular disease con-
tinues to be the leading cause of death in the
United States, taking the lives of approxi-
mately 800,000 individuals in the United
States each year and accounting for 1 in 3
deaths across the United States;
Whereas congenital heart defects are—
(1) the most common birth defect in the
United States; and
(2) the leading killer of infants with birth
defects;
Whereas, each year, an estimated 790,000
individuals in the United States have a heart
attack, of whom an estimated 115,000 die;
Whereas, in 2015, cardiovascular disease ac-
counted for $555,000,000,000 in health care ex-
penditures and lost productivity;
Whereas, by 2035, cardiovascular disease
will account for $1,093,900,000,000 in health
care expenditures and lost productivity an-
nually;
Whereas individuals in the United States
have made great progress in reducing the
death rate for cardiovascular disease, but
this progress has been more modest with re-
spect to the death rate for cardiovascular
disease in women and minorities;
Whereas many people do not recognize that
cardiovascular disease is the leading killer of
women in the United States, taking the lives
of over 400,000 women in 2016;
Whereas nearly 2⁄3 of women who unexpect-
edly die of cardiovascular disease have no
previous symptoms of the disease;
Whereas over 1⁄2 of all African-American
adults have some form of cardiovascular dis-
ease, including 57.1 percent of African-Amer-
ican women and 60.1 percent of African-
American men;
Whereas more Alaska Natives and Amer-
ican Indians die from cardiovascular disease
than individuals from other ethnic groups;
Whereas it is estimated that 36 percent of
Alaska Natives and American Indians who
die of cardiovascular disease die before
reaching 65 years of age;
Whereas Native Hawaiians have higher
mortality rates and die at a younger average
age from cardiovascular disease than other
ethnic groups in Hawaii;
Whereas many minority women, including
African-American, Hispanic, Asian-Amer-
ican, and Native American women and
women from indigenous populations, have a
greater prevalence of risk factors or are at a
higher risk of death from heart disease,
stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases,
but are less likely to know of the risk;
Whereas, between 1965 and 2018, treatment
of cardiovascular disease for women was
largely based on medical research on men;
Whereas, due to the differences in cardio-
vascular disease between men and women,
more research and data on the effects of car-
diovascular disease treatments for women is
vital;
Whereas extensive clinical and statistical
studies have identified major and contrib-
uting factors that increase the risk of car-
diovascular disease, including—
(1) high blood pressure;
(2) high blood cholesterol;
(3) smoking tobacco products;
(4) exposure to tobacco smoke;
(5) physical inactivity;
(6) obesity; and
(7) diabetes mellitus;
Whereas an individual can greatly reduce
the risk of cardiovascular disease through
lifestyle modification coupled with medical
treatment when necessary;
Whereas greater awareness and early de-
tection of risk factors for cardiovascular dis-
ease can improve and save the lives of thou-
sands of individuals in the United States
each year;
Whereas, under section 101(1) of title 36,
United States Code, the President is re-
quested to issue an annual proclamation des-
ignating February as American Heart
Month;
Whereas the National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute of the National Institutes of
Health, the American Heart Association, and
many other organizations celebrate National
Wear Red Day during February by ‘‘going
red’’ to increase awareness about cardio-
vascular disease as the leading killer of
women; and
Whereas, every year since 1964, the Presi-
dent has issued a proclamation designating
the month of February as American Heart
Month: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) designates—
(A) February 2019 as ‘‘American Heart
Month’’; and
(B) February 1, 2019, as ‘‘National Wear
Red Day’’;
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Amer-
ican Heart Month and National Wear Red
Day;
(3) recognizes and reaffirms the commit-
ment of the United States to fighting cardio-
vascular disease—
(A) by promoting awareness about the
causes, risks, and prevention of cardio-
vascular disease;

Mr. MORAN, Mr. SCOTT of Florida, Mr.
SULLIVAN, and Mr. MENENDEZ) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which
was considered and agreed to:
S. RES. 84
Whereas, in 1776, people envisioned the
United States as a new nation dedicated to
the proposition stated in the Declaration of
Independence that ‘‘all men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Cre-
ator with certain unalienable Rights, that
among these are Life, Liberty and the pur-
suit of Happiness . . .’’;
Whereas Africans were first brought invol-
untarily to the shores of the United States
as early as the 17th century;
Whereas African Americans suffered en-
slavement and subsequently faced the injus-
tices of lynch mobs, segregation, and denial
of the basic and fundamental rights of citi-
zenship;
Whereas, in 2019, the vestiges of those in-
justices and inequalities remain evident in
the society of the United States;
Whereas, in the face of injustices, people of
good will and of all races in the United
States have distinguished themselves with a
commitment to the noble ideals on which
the United States was founded and have
fought courageously for the rights and free-
dom of African Americans and others;
Whereas African Americans, such as Lieu-
tenant Colonel Allen Allensworth, Maya
Angelou, Louis Armstrong, Arthur Ashe, Jr.,
James Baldwin, James Beckwourth, Clara
Brown, Blanche Bruce, Ralph Bunche, Shir-
ley Chisholm, Holt Collier, Miles Davis,
Larry Doby, Frederick Douglass, W. E. B. Du
Bois, Ralph Ellison, Medgar Evers, Aretha
Franklin, Alex Haley, Dorothy Height, Jon
Hendricks, Olivia Hooker, Lena Horne,
Charles Hamilton Houston, Mahalia Jack-
son, Stephanie Tubbs Jones, B.B. King, Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr., Coretta Scott King,
Thurgood Marshall, Constance Baker Mot-
ley, Rosa Parks, Walter Payton, Bill Pick-
ett, Homer Plessy, Bass Reeves, Hiram Rev-
els, Amelia Platts Boynton Robinson, Jackie
Robinson, Aaron Shirley, Sojourner Truth,
Harriet Tubman, Booker T. Washington, the
Greensboro Four, the Tuskegee Airmen,
Prince Rogers Nelson, Recy Taylor, Fred
Shuttlesworth, Duke Ellington, Langston
Hughes, Muhammad Ali, Ella Fitzgerald,
Mamie Till, and Edith Savage-Jennings,
along with many others, worked against rac-
ism to achieve success and to make signifi-
cant contributions to the economic, edu-
cational, political, artistic, athletic, lit-
erary, scientific, and technological advance-
ment of the United States;
Whereas the contributions of African
Americans from all walks of life throughout
the history of the United States reflect the
greatness of the United States;
Whereas many African Americans lived,
toiled, and died in obscurity, never achieving
the recognition those individuals deserved,
and yet paved the way for future generations
to succeed;
Whereas African Americans continue to
serve the United States at the highest levels
of business, government, and the military;
Whereas the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln
and Frederick Douglass inspired the creation
of Negro History Week, the precursor to
Black History Month;
Whereas Negro History Week represented
the culmination of the efforts of Dr. Carter
G. Woodson, the ‘‘Father of Black History’’,
to enhance knowledge of Black history
through The Journal of Negro History, pub-
lished by the Association for the Study of
African American Life and History, which
was founded by Dr. Carter G. Woodson and
Jesse E. Moorland;
Whereas Black History Month, celebrated
during the month of February, originated in
1926 when Dr. Carter G. Woodson set aside a
special period in February to recognize the
heritage and achievements of Black people
in the United States;
Whereas Dr. Carter G. Woodson stated,
‘‘We have a wonderful history behind
us. . . . If you are unable to demonstrate to
the world that you have this record, the
world will say to you, ‘You are not worthy to
enjoy the blessings of democracy or anything
else.’ ’’;
Whereas, since its founding, the United
States has imperfectly progressed toward
noble goals;
Whereas the history of the United States is
the story of people regularly affirming high
ideals, striving to reach those ideals but
often failing, and then struggling to come to
terms with the disappointment of that fail-
ure, before committing to try again;
Whereas, on November 4, 2008, the people of
the United States elected Barack Obama, an
African-American man, as President of the
United States; and
Whereas, on February 22, 2012, people
across the United States celebrated the
groundbreaking of the National Museum of
African American History and Culture,
which opened to the public on September 24,
2016, on the National Mall in Washington,
District of Columbia: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) acknowledges that all people of the
United States are the recipients of the
wealth of history provided by Black culture;
(2) recognizes the importance of Black His-
tory Month as an opportunity to reflect on
the complex history of the United States,
while remaining hopeful and confident about
the path ahead;
(3) acknowledges the significance of Black
History Month as an important opportunity
to commemorate the tremendous contribu-
tions of African Americans to the history of
the United States;
(4) encourages the celebration of Black
History Month to provide a continuing op-
portunity for all people in the United States
to learn from the past and understand the
experiences that have shaped the United
States; and
(5) agrees that, while the United States
began as a divided country, the United
States must—
(A) honor the contribution of all pioneers
in the United States who have helped to en-
sure the legacy of the great United States;
and
(B) move forward with purpose, united tire-
lessly as a nation ‘‘indivisible, with liberty
and justice for all.’’.

f
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I am
here today to talk about climate
change and about our climate crisis.
Climate change is an existential
threat to our country and the planet.
We know this because the world’s lead-
ing scientists—the United Nations
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change—just made that very warning
last year. The U.N. report told us that
we have very limited time until we are
past the point of no return and the
most catastrophic impacts of climate
change are irreversible. Our own Fed-
eral scientists across 13 Agencies also
just warned in the ‘‘National Climate
Assessment’’ that the impacts of cli-
mate change are not in the future but
are happening in our communities
right now. Here is what all 13 Federal
Agencies said: ‘‘Our efforts do not yet
approach the scale necessary to avoid
substantial damages to the economy,
environment, and human health.’’
These are Earth-shattering reports
about the state of our Earth. These are
the doomsday reports about what will
happen if we do not take bold action.
The consequences of climate change
will be dire: a tenfold increase in ice-
free summers in the Arctic, a 99-per-
cent loss of coral reefs, and a doubling
of species lost around the world. In
worst-case scenarios in the Northeast,
by the end of the century, both the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and Logan Airport will be underwater.
Climate emissions are not slowing
down. In 2018, greenhouse gas emissions
in the United States increased by 2.8
percent. We have a denier-in-chief in
the White House.
This week, Republicans in the Senate
are poised to confirm a coal lobbyist to
be the head of the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency. It is unbelievable that
we will confirm a coal lobbyist to be
the head of our environment in our
country. Andrew Wheeler’s denial of
the climate crisis should in and of
itself be disqualifying. His record as a
coal lobbyist should be disqualifying.
We should come together and reject
Andrew Wheeler as the next head of the
Environmental Protection Agency. The
impact of climate change on ordinary
families, on their health, on our Na-
tion, on our security, and on our future
is too urgent.
The United Nations tells us that cli-
mate change is an existential threat to
the planet. It is the national security,
health, economic, and moral issue of
our time—of all time. We have a re-
sponsibility to act. We must be bold.
We must be ambitious. That is why I
have introduced the Green New Deal
resolution, because it lays out a seri-
ous, bold, and aspirational set of goals

February 27, 2019
that meet the scale of the threat. It is
a set of principles and not prescrip-
tions. It challenges this country to find
solutions to this problem.
The Green New Deal is a climate plan
about net-zero emissions. The Repub-
lican climate plan is in zero existence.
They don’t have a climate plan. Repub-
licans don’t like the Green New Deal
because they don’t like a functional
government. Republicans don’t like the
Green New Deal because they don’t
like climate science. Republicans don’t
like the Green New Deal because their
allies—the oil companies, the coal
companies, and the corporate pol-
luters—don’t like wind power or solar
power or all-electric vehicles or the
millions of blue-collar jobs they can
create. We can save all of creation by
engaging in massive blue-collar job
creation in this country. Republicans
don’t like the Green New Deal because
clean energy is a direct threat to the
interests and the bottom line of Big Oil
and King Coal.
The Green New Deal isn’t just a so-
cialist manifesto. It isn’t pie in the
sky. It isn’t a takeover. It isn’t any of
the misinformation and distortions
that Republicans and their fossil fuel
allies have called it. The Green New
Deal isn’t, as the Republican leader
called it this morning, ‘‘the far left’s
Santa Claus wish list dressed up to
look like serious policy.’’ If it were,
then Republicans in this Chamber
wouldn’t care enough about it to spend
their entire morning remarks on it,
and the majority leader wouldn’t be
threatening to bring it to the floor
without any hearings, without any ex-
pert testimony, without any amend-
ments, and without any science.
Let’s have the debate. Let’s have the
hearings. Let’s bring in all the experts.
Let’s let the U.N. testify. Let’s let our
own scientists and every one of the
Federal Agencies in America testify.
Let’s bring in all of the corporate ex-
ecutives right now on wind, solar, all-
electric vehicles, and storage batteries
in our society. Bring them in. Let’s
hear the stories. Instead, what we have
is just an attempt to short-circuit the
debate.
They may not believe climate change
is an existential threat to human kind,
but they are smart enough to know
that the bold goals of the Green New
Deal are an existential threat to the
Koch brothers and all of their other
corporate polluter and fossil fuel allies.
Let me just read some of what is in
the Green New Deal that Republicans
are opposed to: securing for all people
of the United States for generations to
come clean air and water, climate and
community resiliency, healthy food,
access to nature, and a sustainable en-
vironment.
Are Republicans opposed to access to
nature? That is in the resolution. Are
Republicans opposed to clean air and
water? That is in the resolution too. Do
you know what is not in the resolu-
tion? Ending airline travel. Do you
know what is not in the resolution? No
more cows.
Do you know what is not in the reso-
lution? A prohibition on nuclear en-
ergy or carbon capture and sequestra-
tion. The Green New Deal resolution is
bold, and it is aspirational in its prin-
ciples, but it is not prescriptive in its
policies.
Let’s look at some of what is actu-
ally in this resolution: to create mil-
lions of good, high-wage jobs—I guess
Republicans don’t believe in that; to
invest in the infrastructure and indus-
try of the United States to sustainably
meet the challenge of the 21st cen-
tury—I guess Republicans don’t believe
in that; guaranteeing universal access
to clean water, supporting family farm-
ing, cleaning up existing hazardous
waste and abandoned sites, ensuring
economic development and sustain-
ability on those sites—I guess Repub-
licans don’t believe in those either.
Those are all part of the Green New
Deal and climate solutions.
We already know that Big Oil and
King Coal and other fossil fuel compa-
nies don’t want to compete with clean
energy because that is a direct threat
to their business plan.
Clean energy makes the air we
breathe cleaner, it saves consumers
money, it makes us safer, and it cre-
ates jobs.
In his remarks, the Republican leader
called the Green New Deal ‘‘foolish and
dangerous.’’ With all due respect to the
leader and my Republican colleagues,
the only foolish and dangerous thing
about the Green New Deal is to ignore
the $400 billion in damage to our coun-
try over the last 2 years from super-
charged storms and wildfires all over
California and all over the West.
To ignore the tens of trillions of dol-
lars in damages we will see from cli-
mate change in the United States by
2100 is something that ultimately, from
my perspective, is foolish and dan-
gerous. An ounce of prevention is bet-
ter than a pound of cure. Ignoring what
is happening, ignoring the warnings
from all of the top scientists in the
world and in the United States and
continuing on the same pathway—that
is foolish, that is dangerous, and that
is going to cost us tens of trillions of
dollars in damages that would have
been otherwise avoided if we unleashed
a technology revolution in our country
that would create millions of new jobs.
It is also dangerous to send our men
and women in the military overseas to
protect tankers of oil coming from the
Middle East to the United States. We
are still bringing in oil from Saudi Ara-
bia. We are still bringing in oil from
other countries in the Middle East.
What if we could dramatically increase
the fuel economy in the vehicles we
drive? What if we could accelerate the
pace to use all-electric vehicles?
Wouldn’t it be great if we could say
that the day arrived when we never
have to see another tanker of oil from
the Middle East coming into our coun-
try? Would that not make us safer?
Would that not give us better control
of our own foreign policy and where we
send young men and women in uni-
form? I think it would.
I think it would be foolish and dan-
gerous not to take that pathway. The
superstorms, the wildfires, the rising
seas, and the other extreme weather
events—the impacts of climate change
if we do not act boldly to stop it—that
isn’t just dangerous; that is an existen-
tial threat. That is what the world’s
scientists have called it.
The Green New Deal is dangerous for
the status quo of doing nothing on cli-
mate change. It is dangerous for the
Koch brothers and those who are used
to killing off every climate debate be-
fore it gets a chance to start. It is dan-
gerous for those who want us to limp
into a frightening future with no plan
and no protections in place. It is dan-
gerous for those who benefit from the
continued devaluation of our workers,
the historic oppression of vulnerable
communities, and from the continued
destruction of the environment. Those
are the ones who would think the
Green New Deal is dangerous.
We want to support working families
and support a safe climate future
where all communities are protected.
We welcome a debate on proposals for
how to get there, but the science is
clear as to where we need to end up.
The Republicans may think that the
Green New Deal is just a resolution,
but it is a revolution. It is a revolu-
tion. Young people want a green energy
revolution in our country. They know
we can do this. They know that all of
these new technologies can be in-
vented; all of these new technologies
can be deployed.
It is not just a resolution; it is a rev-
olution. All across this country, when
the Republicans have refused to bring
their climate plan out there because
theirs is a party of science denial—the
President is the ‘‘Denier in Chief’’ on
climate science—then we are going to
allow this problem to worsen and wors-
en and worsen.
Do you know who should know best?
Donald Trump, because within 30
years, according to the science, Mar-a-
Lago is going to become Mar-a-Lagoon.
It is right on the coast. It has already
begun to happen. It is just going to
continue.
The President might be able to pro-
tect his property, but we are going to
lose tens of trillions of dollars for the
properties of other Americans because
he decided that he was going to deny
the warning that the scientists have
presented to us.
When I was a boy, lying on the rug,
looking at President Kennedy on the
television, he challenged our country
to send a mission to the Moon and to
return that mission safely to the
United States within 10 years.
When he gave that speech at Rice
University, he made very clear in the
speech that we would have to invent
new metal alloys that did not exist. We
would have to invent new transmission
systems that did not exist, that we
would have to return that mission safe-
ly from the Moon through heat half the

intensity of the Sun. We would have to
complete it within 10 years, and we
would have to do it not because it was
easy but because it was hard. We had
to be bold.
Because the challenge from the So-
viet Union was so great, the United
States did not have an option. Failure
was not an option, and we completed
that mission.
Well, the same thing is true here for
a Green New Deal. Failure is not an op-
tion. The consequences will be cata-
strophic for our planet and for the
United States of America, and the solu-
tion is to unleash this green energy
job-creation engine. We now have
350,000 solar and wind workers in the
United States. It is up from almost
nothing in 2008. It has already hap-
pened over 10 years.
We had only 1,000 megawatts of solar
in our country in 2008. We now have
62,000 megawatts of solar.
We had only 25,000 megawatts of
wind. We now have 98,000 megawatts of
wind.
We had only 2,000 all-electric vehicles
in our country in 2008. We now have a
million, and between Tesla and all of
the other companies, they are going to
sell 500,000 just this year in our coun-
try. They have invented new metals.
They have invented new battery sys-
tems. They have invented new propul-
sion systems in order to solve those
problems, but we still have a long way
to go.
It is imperative that we put the tax
breaks for wind and solar, for all elec-
tric vehicles, for batteries on the books
and make them permanent because
this problem is going to be solved only
if we can convince the smartest young
people in our country that all of the in-
centives, all of the policies are there
and that their country has their back
and wants them to solve the problem in
the same way that our whole country
had the back of NASA in the 1960s. If
we do that, we will be successful. There
is no question about it in my mind.
I am a technological optimist, and I
hate the pessimism of the other side. I
hate this ‘‘can’t do’’ mentality that
they have, especially given what has
happened in the last 10 years in electric
vehicles and wind, solar, and storage
technology breakthroughs. It is just
really sad to hear this.
I think, ultimately, something is ris-
ing up across this country. Young peo-
ple, especially, know it is time for the
revolution. They know it is time to
close the door on this era where all we
do is indiscriminately use the atmos-
phere as a sewer for all of this carbon
and all of these greenhouse gases.
I am very confident that one way or
another this body will start to act or it
is going to become one of the top two
or three election issues in 2020 because
this generation knows that the planet
is running a fever. There are no emer-
gency rooms on planets, and it is going
to take action in this body in order to
put the policies in place, in order to
preserve this planet and hand it on bet-
ter than we found it.
The challenge is great. The Green
New Deal sets the framework for lay-
ing out how serious the problem is and
how bold the action has to be to deal
with that serious problem for our plan-
et.
If we do it right, I think future gen-
erations will look back on ours in the
same way we now look back on Presi-
dent Kennedy and that generation, and
they will know that they discharged
their historic responsibility to our
country and to the planet.
With that, I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii.
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, in many
ways, Andrew Wheeler is a perfect ex-
ample of a Cabinet appointment in the
Trump era—conflicted, unethical, and
hostile to the mission of the Agency he
was nominated to lead.
He shouldn’t have been confirmed to
this position as Deputy Administrator
of the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy, the EPA, and he certainly shouldn’t
be confirmed to lead the Agency on a
permanent basis.
Prior to his service at EPA, Mr.
Wheeler spent 8 years lobbying for
many of the special interests that he is
targeted or charged with regulating.
For example, in his work for Murray
Energy, whose president, Robert Mur-
ray, was among the largest donors to
Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, Mr.
Wheeler worked to kill a rule that
would have prevented coal companies
from dumping mining waste into Amer-
ican streams and waterways.
As a lobbyist for Murray Energy, Mr.
Wheeler also fought tooth and nail
against President Obama’s Clean
Power Plan, a forward-looking initia-
tive that would have substantially re-
duced carbon emissions from power
generation.
Mr. Wheeler’s client, Robert Murray,
was present front and center as former
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt signed
an Executive order to begin the process
of dismantling the Clean Power Plan. I
don’t think that was a coincidence.
After Mr. Wheeler’s confirmation as
the EPA’s Deputy Administrator, he
assured Bloomberg News in June 2018:
‘‘If I lobbied on something, I don’t
think it’s appropriate for me to partici-
pate [in policymaking].’’
Of course, he was lobbying on a lot of
things for years. In fact, Mr. Wheeler
participated in meetings with three
former clients with interests before the
EPA. Holding these meetings with
former clients is a clear conflict of in-
terest and ethical lapse. Andrew Wheel-
er fits right in with Donald Trump’s
version of ‘‘draining the swamp,’’
which is more like ‘‘come on in, the
water’s fine.’’
We have already had one EPA Ad-
ministrator, Scott Pruitt, resign in dis-
grace over ethical lapses and poten-
tially illegal behavior in office. We
don’t need another.
Mr. Wheeler’s work at the EPA is
also consistent with the hostility of
Trump Cabinet officials to the core
mission of the Department or the
Agency that they are appointed to
lead.
The EPA is the primary Agency
charged with safeguarding the environ-
ment and protecting public health from
dangerous and toxic chemicals. At its
core, the EPA is tasked with making
sure we have safe air to breathe and
clean water to drink.
Yet, during his time as Deputy Ad-
ministrator, Mr. Wheeler has cham-
pioned a deregulatory agenda that fun-
damentally undermines the EPA’s core
mission. Under Mr. Wheeler’s leader-
ship, the EPA has proposed under-
mining the legal authority of the mer-
cury and air toxics standard to reduce
emissions of mercury and other toxic
air emissions from coal and oil burning
powerplants.
According to the Union of Concerned
Scientists, mercury exposure can dam-
age the nervous, digestive, and immune
systems and is a serious threat to child
development. The EPA’s current ef-
forts to reverse these emission stand-
ards, in place since 2012, come after
utilities across the country had al-
ready invested resources in reducing
mercury emissions by 90 percent.
Under Mr. Wheeler’s leadership, the
Trump administration has also pro-
posed a dramatic weakening of fuel
economy and greenhouse gas emissions
standards for cars. Their proposed rule
would increase air pollution from vehi-
cles and would result in Hawaii fami-
lies ending up paying thousands more
dollars for gasoline to fill less efficient
cars. Through his opposition to the
Clean Power Plan and his efforts to re-
peal it at the EPA, Mr. Wheeler serves
as a primary architect of the Trump
administration’s assault on climate
science and their refusal to act deci-
sively against climate change. This as-
sault can also be seen in a new pro-
posed rule from the EPA that would ex-
clude rigorous, peer-reviewed scientific
studies under the guise of promoting
scientific transparency.
At first glance, the rule sounds like
something everyone should support,
but like so many initiatives proposed
by this administration, the rule’s true
intent is much more sinister.
Insisting that policymaking rely
only on studies that make all of their
data public would exclude studies that
rely on confidential medical informa-
tion that by law cannot be made pub-
lic. Limiting the factual basis on which
the EPA can make decisions in this
manner would have a catastrophic im-
pact on public health.
If this rule had been in effect in 1993,

School of Public Health would never
have transformed the way we regulate
air pollution in this country. The study
showed that Americans living in cities
with more air pollution have shorter
lifespans than Americans living in cit-
ies with less air pollution.
Using confidential medical informa-
tion, the study conclusively dem-
onstrated that fine particulate matter
that is smaller than 2.5 microns is ex-
ceptionally deadly to human beings.
These findings, which have been backed
up in subsequent studies, provide the
basis for cost-benefit analyses done by
EPA for future rules regulating air pol-
lution. Undermining this kind of evi-
dence-based policymaking would give
industry the green light to pollute with
fewer consequences.
This proposed rule is consistent with
an administration-wide effort to pro-
mote ignorance in the face of the real
threat climate change poses to na-
tional security, public health, and pub-
lic safety.
Climate change is an issue where ig-
norance is not bliss. Ignorance is dan-
gerous. The President’s own top secu-
rity officials agree. Director of Na-
tional Intelligence Dan Coats, for ex-
ample, issued a new worldwide threat
that concluded that ‘‘climate hazards’’
like extreme weather, wildfires,
droughts, and acidifying oceans are,
‘‘threatening infrastructure, health
and water and food security.’’
In 2017, then-Secretary of Defense
James Mattis told the Senate Armed
Services Committee that ‘‘climate
change is impacting stability in areas
of the world where our troops are oper-
ating.’’ He went on to say that ‘‘cli-
mate change is a challenge that re-
quires a broader whole-of-government
government response.’’
Instead of accepting the conclusions
of his top national security officials,
Donald Trump is following the rec-
ommendation of William Happer, a no-
torious climate denier and now a Sen-
ior Director on the NSC, to establish a
new Presidential Committee on Cli-
mate Security.
Dr. Happer is particularly notorious
for his assertion that ‘‘the demoniza-
tion of carbon dioxide is just like the
demonization of the poor Jews under
Hitler. Carbon dioxide is actually a
benefit to the world, and so are the
Jews.
Anyone who makes this kind of out-
rageous analogy should not be en-
trusted to lead anything on climate se-
curity, in my view.
No one should doubt that the Presi-
dent and Dr. Happer have a preordained
outcome in mind. They want to legiti-
mize ignorance and denial of climate
change and abandon tens of millions of
Americans to the disastrous impacts of
climate change in the coming decades.
I repeat, with climate change, igno-
rance is not bliss. It is dangerous. It is
dangerous for a State like Hawaii that
would be the hardest hit by the impact
of climate change. With extreme
weather, ocean acidification, coral
bleaching, and rising seas, climate
change poses an existential threat to
our State. It is one of the reasons Ha-
waii has implemented some of the most
ambitious and aggressive policies to
combat climate change in the country.
Hawaii was the first State to sepa-
rately ratify the Paris climate agree-
ment and has set an ambitious goal of
becoming carbon neutral and gener-
ating 100 percent of our power from re-
newable sources by 2045. Hawaii’s ambi-
tious effort to confront climate change
and the success we have already seen in
moving toward our goals demonstrate
that we can embrace similarly ambi-
tious policies at the national level.
It is one of the reasons I have signed
on as a cosponsor of the Green New
Deal—an aspirational effort to trans-
form our economy to combat climate
change.
In the weeks since the plan was in-
troduced, we have endured all kinds of
mocking outrage from people who
would rather stick their heads in the
sand as science and fact deniers. They
paint the Green New Deal as something
scary and dangerous for the country.
What is really scary and dangerous are
people like them who deny that cli-
mate change is real and refuse to do
anything about it in their steadfast
support and alliance with the fossil
fuel industry. History will not be kind
to them.
Rejecting the nomination of Andrew
Wheeler to serve as Administrator of
the Environmental Protection Agency,
we can take one step forward in the
fight against dangerous ignorance.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon.
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, Henry
David Thoreau once said: ‘‘What use is
a home if you don’t have a tolerable
planet to put it on?’’
We might just expand that question
to say what use is anything if we de-
stroy our planet because it is the only
one we have. There is no planet B, no
rescuing by going to some horrific
other planet nearby. We have the gem,
we have the treasure, and we have the
responsibility to make sure we don’t
destroy it.
Here we are. Within a single human
lifetime, we have increased the percent
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by
a dramatic amount—about 30 percent
in my lifetime and more if you are
older—and that chemistry change is
really unseen in geological history on
this planet, such a rapid change with
rapid, deep growth.
That is why we are coming to the
floor to keep talking about this issue,
reach across the aisle, reach across the
country, and find partners to say this
isn’t a blue or red issue. This isn’t a
city or rural issue. It affects us all, and
we need to all work together to re-
spond. As we do so, we need America to
lead the world in responding.
Senator CARPER’s resolution says a
couple simple things. It says we recog-
nize that we have a very warming cli-
mate on Earth. It says we recognize
that human activity burning fossil fuel
has consequences, and it calls on us to
act. There we are. It is time to con-
front this enormous threat to our beau-
tiful blue-green home in the middle of
the cosmos.
There are some who say: That is so
scary, so intimidating, so threatening.
I just can’t open my eyes or ears to
hear that information. I have to pre-
tend it is not real.
We are here in the Senate. We are
here where we don’t have the privilege
of covering our eyes, our ears, pre-
tending it is not happening. We have
the responsibility to face this when
others shy away and act.
There are others who say: You know,
we just can’t be sure exactly what is
happening so let’s wait another 10 or 20
years because we can’t measure it as
precisely as we want. It is like saying:
Oh, cancer is ravaging my body, but I
am not going to take any medicine be-
cause I am not sure if it has affected 15
percent or 16 percent of my cells. Well,
you know you have cancer, and you
know you need to act.
So there we are. Let us not let our
heads be buried in the tar sands. Cli-
mate chaos is real. It is ravaging our
planet. It is because of human activity,
and we do have the responsibility to re-
spond.
The year 2018 was one of the four hot-
test years on record. Nine out of the
ten of the hottest years on record oc-
curred since the year 2000. If we are
looking at this chart, we don’t see the
Earth becoming any cooler. We see the
Earth becoming a lot warmer. Four of
the hottest years on record, 2018, 2017,
2016, and 2015—that was the last 4 years
having been the 4 hottest years on
record. The odds of that happening by
accident is essentially none.
We have some very serious scientific
heft weighing in. In October, the
United Nations climate panel said we
must act dramatically within this next
decade. A month later, on Black Fri-
day, we had the release of the ‘‘Fourth
National Climate Assessment’’—the
Trump administration’s ‘‘Fourth Na-
tional Climate Assessment’’—and it
concluded that ‘‘Earth’s climate is now
changing faster than at any point in
the history of modern civilization, pri-
marily as a result of human activi-
ties.’’
There was a report from the Global
Carbon Project that which found that
global carbon emissions are going up.
They went up 0.7 percent in 2018, hit-
ting a record breaking 37.1 metric tons
around the world. That is human activ-
ity putting out carbon dioxide that
acts as a blanket on the planet. This
isn’t some new thought.
We go back to 1959. We had an emi-
nent scientist who became better
known for his work in the nuclear
world, but he was asked to address the
100th anniversary of the petroleum in-
dustry. At that speech in 1959, he said:

harnessed can do dramatic things to

S1550 February 27, 2019
change the world, but you have a cou-
ple of challenges. One challenge is that
there isn’t an infinite amount of petro-
leum in the ground. Another challenge
is it creates carbon dioxide. It doesn’t
look like a pollutant because you can’t
see it and you can’t smell it, but in
fact, it traps heat. I think he framed it
more scientifically, that it traps infra-
red energy.
He said that is going to be a problem,
and, of course, we are seeing that prob-
lem all the time now. You don’t need
these scientific reports out of a global
panel or a fourth assessment from the
administration to tell us what is going
on because we see the facts on the
ground.
In my home State of Oregon, you
can’t move around the State without
seeing the impact. In Eastern Oregon,
you have the warmer winter. It is not
killing the pine beetles. So the pine
beetles are killing the trees. More pine
beetles and less trees is not a good
thing.
If you are over on the coast, the oys-
ter men will tell you they had a big cri-
sis in 2008 and 2009 because all of the
baby oysters were dying, not because of
a bacteria but because the acidity in
the Pacific Ocean has gone up. How is
that related? Because carbon dioxide is
absorbed by the ocean and becomes
carbonic acid. We burn so much carbon
dioxide that we changed the acidity of
the ocean. Can you imagine that is pos-
sible? It seems impossible, but it
speaks to how much carbon dioxide we
released within a few decades of human
civilization on this planet.
You can keep going on with this
story around Oregon. Our kelp beds are
disappearing. They provide protection
for all kinds of fish species. The kelp
are dying because the blue sea urchins
are eating them. The blue sea urchins
are expanding rapidly because the
starfish are dying because the ocean
got too warm for them. It is one story
after another. There is less irrigation
water, less snowpack, warmer streams,
and harsher conditions for trout and
salmon all within the State of Oregon,
and there are similar stories through-
out our Nation.
Perhaps the most destructive factor,
though, has been the increased number
of forest fires. There are bigger fires,
hotter fires, and a longer fire season.
They are not just ravaging our forests
but producing smoke that has a huge
impact on our towns. We take a lot of
pride in our wine in Oregon, and a lot
of our grapes had smoke taint and
weren’t usable this last year.
We have towns where furniture sales-
men said they couldn’t sell the fur-
niture because it had the lingering
smell of smoke.
It had an impact on the entertain-
ment world. The Shakespeare Festival
had to shut down and partially move
inside to smaller venues, which is hav-
ing a huge impact on their finances and
a huge impact on the tourism attrac-
tion.
This stuff is real. It is why we should
all be here, Democrats and Repub-
licans, talking about the challenge and
saying: What higher calling is there in
our life than to come together to dis-
cuss this honestly and to work to-
gether to find solutions?
This isn’t something where we can
just say that the next generation can
deal with it because the effects are cu-
mulative. They build up. They become
worse. It is a lot worse now than it was
10 years ago, and 10 years from now, it
will be more so.
There is no easy, fast way to strip
the carbon dioxide back out of the air.
We can work at it, but it is not easy.
We can plant more trees, yes, but,
meanwhile, those hotter fires are kill-
ing more trees. Those pine beetles are
killing more trees. In other words, it is
urgent. The time to act is now.
In 1988 George H. W. Bush ran for
President as an environmentalist. He
announced he was going to take on
global warming. His opponent, the
Democrat, ran on the coal industry.
That is not the same partisan alliance
as you might hear today. George H. W.
Bush said: ‘‘Our land, water and soil
support a remarkable range of human
activities, but they can only take so
much and we must remember to treat
them not as a given but as a gift.’’
Those words should echo in this
Chamber. We have other words in this
Chamber that seem to not address all
of the facts that are right in front of
us. One individual said: ‘‘The satellite
says it ain’t happening.’’ Well, one
could probably pick out some one piece
of data from one satellite somewhere
and say it doesn’t show the story, but
you collect all the data together and it
is happening.
Here is a chart of how the globe is
warming over time. It shows the dif-
ference in average temperatures. Here
we are with just one tiny cache where
there is a significant drop in tempera-
ture. There is a little bit of white and
light blue showing that it stayed about
the same, and there is a whole lot of
red saying things are getting a lot
worse. That is the collected data.
Maybe there is some satellite that took
a picture of one little spot here, but to
cherry-pick data like that is dishonest.
We can’t afford to pretend that
things are OK when we are facing such
a dramatic challenge to our blue-green
home in the universe. NOAA, or the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration, works at this, and they
record all kinds of data from all around
the world.
Here is another chart that shows the
Earth’s climate record. This one shows
the zigs and zags over time. We are
going back to 1880, but if we look from
1880 to 1980, we see a significant rise in
the temperature of the planet. If we go
from 1980 until now, it is this abso-
lutely frightening horror show of in-
creasing temperature. That is what is
happening when we talk about
snowpacks. We talk about glaciers, we
talk about coral, we talk about pine
beetles, and we talk about 100 of these
things where there is that feedback.
All of those affect humans. Those
aren’t just some abstract things, like if
a tree falls in the woods but nobody
hears it, did it really happen? Did we
really hear it? Does it matter? No.
These reverberate back on our qual-
ity of life in this planet, including se-
curity concerns. The civil war in Syria
that produced millions of refugees try-
ing to get to Europe started with an
extended drought because of the
stresses of a warming planet.
Our military weighs in and says that
climate chaos accentuates all the secu-
rity concerns we have. It creates insta-
bility around the world. If one doesn’t
want to listen to the scientists, how
about if we listen to our own military?
That is what the discussion of Sen-
ator CARPER’s resolution is all about.
That is what the Green New Deal is all
about. The Green New Deal says a few
simple things. It says we have a big
problem. Check. Yes, we do. It says we
need to take it on boldly and aggres-
sively. Check. Yes, we do. It says when
we take it on boldly, we can create mil-
lions of jobs, and that will be a good
thing for our economy. Check. Yes, it
is.
Creating those jobs is good. It says
when we do that, we shouldn’t leave
our frontline communities behind. We
should make sure those communities—
rural communities and inner-city com-
munities that have been left behind
previously in different economic expan-
sions—can’t be left behind now. Check.
That is absolutely right.
Let’s make this economic surge ben-
efit everyone in every community,
with special attention to communities
that have been struggling.
My colleague is here from Virginia. I
am so glad he is. I am talking a lot
about what is happening on the west
coast of America. Perhaps he will fill
us in a little bit on the perspective
from the east coast. This is not one iso-
lated spot on our planet. This is a con-
cern to all of us. We need bipartisan
work on this. Some suggest we put a
fee on carbon. Let’s have that con-
versation. Some suggest we provide
more subsidies to renewable energy.
Let’s have that conversation. Some say
we should do a green workforce—green
corps training. Let’s talk about that.
Let’s talk about every strategy we can
bring to bear and come to a collective
plan because there is no space in the
urgency of this issue for us to retreat
into blue and red corners. There is no
time. It is unacceptable.
I feel it is such a privilege to come to
this floor and be part of this conversa-
tion, and I encourage all of my col-
leagues to do likewise. There are few
issues that threaten us on this scale,
but this one does. Let’s work together
to save our country and save our plan-
et.

f
VENEZUELA
Mr. President, I actually rise now not
on this topic, which affects Virginia
significantly, especially sea level rise,
but I want to talk a little about the on-
going humanitarian crisis in Ven-
ezuela. I do this on behalf of Ven-
ezuelans. I do this on behalf of Ven-
ezuelan-Americans, many of whom live
in Virginia, but I also do it on behalf of
democracies, because what is hap-
pening in Venezuela today dem-
onstrates, really, in just one country, a
global battle between democracies and
authoritarian nations.
Authoritarian nations are supporting
the regime of Maduro, and the democ-
racies of the world are supporting the
interim government of President
Guaido.
If you want to know, circa 2019, in
the battle being waged between au-
thoritarians and democracies, Ven-
ezuela is a place where you can see it
in one country. You see this global
challenge between democracy and dic-
tatorship.
The Maduro regime has been destroy-
ing Venezuela, which is home to the
world’s largest oil reserve, and it was
once, in recent history, the richest
country in all of Latin America. It is
now in full-fledged economic and polit-
ical collapse, with nearly 80 percent of
the country’s population living below
the poverty line and more than half of
the families unable to meet their basic
food needs.
Right now, inflation in Venezuela is
2.7 million percent and will grow to 10
million percent this year, and most
Venezuelans can’t afford one meal a
day. Medicines and other lifesaving
commodities are too expensive for the
average citizen to purchase, while
Maduro and his colleagues and cronies
syphon funds from state-owned enter-
prises into personal accounts and pro-
hibit humanitarian assistance from en-
tering the country.
Infants have starved to death because
their families couldn’t afford or access
formula. Infectious diseases like ma-
laria, measles, and diphtheria, which
were previously eradicated in Ven-
ezuela, are emerging as public health
system catastrophes.
Maduro is using the power of the
state to subjugate and repress the Ven-
ezuelan people. His security forces use
detention, torture, and lethal force
against demonstrators and political op-
position in what the United Nations
and the Organization of American
States called possible crimes against
humanity.
It has provoked a massive refugee
crisis. There are 3.4 million people and
counting who have made the difficult
decision to leave their homeland be-
cause life has become untenable. Many
have come to Virginia and to the
United States as they have fled two
countries throughout the region and
created Latin America’s worst refugee
crisis, which is worsening by the day.
Make no mistake—this is a manmade
political crisis in a beautiful nation
with beautiful people that would have
ample resources if it were not so poorly
governed.
In May 2018, Maduro declared victory
for a second term in office in an elec-
tion so flawed that the Organization of
American States, the European Union,
and the United States refused to recog-
nize it as legitimate.
Following months of protests, on
January 23, the National Assembly,
which is Venezuela’s only democratic
body, determined that Maduro had
usurped the Office of the President, and
in accordance with the Venezuelan
Constitution’s provision for succes-
sion—and this is important—the Presi-
dent of the National Assembly, Juan
Guaido, assumed the role of the In-
terim President of Venezuela. Again,
that was done pursuant to Venezuelan
constitutional law. The announcement,
which I supported, was swiftly backed
by the United States, by the Organiza-
tion of American States, and by over 50
countries worldwide, including most of
the democracies of the West. In con-
trast, which nations are supporting the
Maduro regime? They are Russia,
China, Iran, Syria, Turkey, Cuba, Nica-
ragua, Bolivia, and Belarus—authori-
tarian nations.
There is a clear international divide
between democracies and authoritar-
ians. We must defend our convictions
and bolster the democracies of the
world. It is about supporting the Ven-
ezuelan people, but it is also about
sending an important message globally
that the United States remains con-
fident that democracy is the way for
people to achieve their hopes and
dreams, and when authoritarians try to
crush the democratic desires of popu-
lations, the United States should be an
ally.
The United States should never tell
another nation who its leader should
be. We have no business being in re-
gime change. We support free and fair
elections. We support constitutions.
That is why I support the current in-
terim Government of Venezuela, which
has been designated pursuant to the
Venezuelan Constitution.
I recently met with the Guaido in-
terim government’s representative to
the United States. I was encouraged to
hear that the National Assembly’s goal
was to move to a democratic system
and replace the interim government
with a national government that would
follow free and transparent elections,
which Maduro has blocked repeatedly.
Support for this goal must continue to
come from the international commu-
nity, the Organization of American
States, and other democracies.
A caution: As a missionary in Hon-
duras in the 1970s, I lived in a military
dictatorship, and I am keenly aware of
the history and the legacy of U.S.
intervention in the Americas. That is
why I was very troubled and remain
troubled by the Trump administra-
tion’s threats of military intervention
in Venezuela. That would be a massive
mistake. The rhetoric is reckless and
counterproductive. Our leaders should
not be bombastic and enflame a deli-
cate situation that could go in the di-
rection of violence and civil unrest. In
fact, the suggestion of U.S. military
intervention actually strengthens the
hand of the dictator because the
Maduro dictatorship would like to
blame Venezuela’s economic challenges
on Uncle Sam or the West rather than
on its own mismanagement of the
economy. The United States should not
be making military threats against
Venezuela.
There are many steps we can take,
though, that would be appropriate. I
support the increase in direct U.S. hu-
manitarian aid for the Venezuelan peo-
ple as the transition unfolds. It is un-
believable that for years, the govern-
ment has refused to allow humani-
tarian aid to enter the country to help
its own people. The scenes we have
seen over the past weekend of road-
blocks on highways entering Venezuela
and the Venezuelan military fighting
to stop humanitarian aid from reach-
ing citizens epitomizes the Maduro re-
gime’s ongoing disregard for the plight
of everyday people.
I support the long needed aid package
that will help international organiza-
tions provide assistance inside Ven-
ezuela that interim President Guaido
welcomes and that former President
Maduro should welcome as well. That
is why I joined Senator MENENDEZ in
cosponsoring the Venezuela Humani-
tarian Relief Act and the Rule of Law
Act, and I will support them in their
reintroductions.
I support the United States in its
playing a role in convincing other na-
tions and the Organization of American
States to also stand for the people of
Venezuela. OAS’s leadership is very
strong, but in the OAS, every member
country has one vote. Venezuela has
used its petroleum reserves to convince
a number of Caribbean nations to back
the dictatorship. I think the United
States could use very plain diplomacy
with Caribbean nations to get them to
support the democracy, the current in-
terim government, and we could do
that and attain some significant suc-
cess.
We should amplify the pressure we
have applied by recognizing the in-
terim government and deploying hu-
manitarian assistance to the border.
South America is absorbing 3.4 million
refugees from Venezuela. The Trump
administration condemns the brutality
of the Maduro Government, but we are
reducing our support for refugees from
Venezuela and elsewhere.
I think the crisis warrants the exten-
sion of temporary protected status to

the Venezuelans who are already in the
United States. If the Trump adminis-
tration is serious about helping Ven-
ezuela recover from a devastating cri-
sis, it cannot require Venezuelans to
return to a deteriorating security situ-
ation there.
It is not our place to dictate the ne-
gotiated terms of a resolution that will
end this crisis. That is the role and the
responsibility of the people of Ven-
ezuela and their representatives, but
the United States and the inter-
national community should create the
right environment for those negotia-
tions to go forward, and they should
provide the assistance to allow this
transition to occur.
We don’t want to see greater violence
or greater civil war in Venezuela. In-
terim President Guaido’s offer of am-
nesty to Maduro’s military and polit-
ical supporters who wish to end their
support for autocratic rule is a good
step, as is his explicit call for a transi-
tional government and free and fair
elections. His role should and must re-
main that of a steward until those elec-
tions take place pursuant to the Ven-
ezuelan Constitution.
There is an example in the region.
The peace agreement in Colombia sig-
naled the end of six decades of conflict.
The hemisphere is on a trajectory to-
ward peace with there being no ongoing
hostilities in the more than 30 coun-
tries. It is critical that we keep it that
way.
In conclusion, during my time in
Honduras, I learned a very important
prayer that we used to say at meal-
time. It was this: (English translation
of the statement made in Spanish is as
follows:) ‘‘Lord, give bread to those
who hunger and hunger for justice to
those who have bread.’’
I call on this body and our colleagues
in the international community to sup-
port the people of Venezuela in their
quest for both bread and justice.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant bill clerk pro-
ceeded to call the roll.
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for
the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, before
my colleague from Virginia leaves, I
admire him so much. I just want to ap-
plaud him and applaud his early work
as a missionary in Honduras.
During our past recess, Senator JEFF
MERKLEY and I and four of our col-
leagues from the House were privileged
to be a part of a 5-day congressional
delegation to Honduras, Guatemala,
and El Salvador. We were there to find
out how the Alliance for Prosperity
was being implemented, of which the
Senator has been very supportive, as
have I, in order to focus on hope, eco-
nomic opportunity, crime, violence,
and corruption.
The Alliance for Prosperity is fo-
cused on all of those matters. The
United States puts up some of the
money to address them, but we expect
the other countries, including Hon-
duras, to put up even more. It is like
being at Home Depot—you can do it,
and we can help. For every $1 in El Sal-
vador, they put up $7, and we leverage
our money to get the support of foun-
dations, NGOs, private companies, and
others to do their share. It is like turn-
ing the course of an aircraft carrier,
and it is starting to turn.
Probably late this week—maybe to-
morrow—I suspect Senator MERKLEY
and I will want to have a colloquy on
the floor. It would be great if the Sen-
ator could join us because he has for-
gotten more about that part of the
world than we will ever know.
Thank you.
I didn’t come to the floor to focus on
that, but I am glad I had the chance to
since Senator KAINE was here.
f
NOMINATION OF ANDREW
WHEELER
Mr. President, I rise this evening to
continue to share with my colleagues
the concerns I have about the nomina-
tion of Andrew Wheeler to be the Ad-
ministrator of the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency.
I want to talk for a couple of minutes
about an issue that is important for all
Americans, and that is reducing mer-
cury and air toxic pollution that affect
the health especially of our children.
As a number of our colleagues know,
reducing mercury and air toxic pollu-
tion from our Nation’s powerplants is
something of a passion for me, and I
know it is for some of my colleagues,
too, Democrats and Republicans. In my
home State of Delaware, for example,
we have made great strides in cleaning
up our own air pollution. Unfortu-
nately, a number of the upwind States
to the west of us have not made the
same commitment.
When I was the Governor of Dela-
ware, I used to say I could have lit-
erally shut down Delaware’s economy—
I could have taken cars, trucks, and
vans off of highways and shut down
every business—and we still would
have been out of compliance for air
quality because of the pollution from
other States. That is because over 90
percent of Delaware’s air pollution
comes from our neighboring States—
over 90 percent.
This air pollution is not only dan-
gerous to our hearts, to our lungs, and
to our brains, but it also costs a great
deal in doctor and hospital bills and in
our quality of life. It makes healthcare
costs in Delaware more expensive than
in other places where they get cheap
electricity. We ended up having to
clean up our emissions. We have more
expensive electricity and higher
healthcare bills. It is just not fair.
Delaware has depended on the EPA
to ensure our neighbors do their fair
share so that we can protect our citi-
zens in the First State. Just recently,
Delaware petitioned the EPA under
something called section 126 of the
Clean Air Act, which requires upwind
powerplants that are located in other
States to turn on and fully operate
their installed pollution technology. I
will say that again—to use their in-
stalled pollution technology. They are
not to turn it off but to leave it on.
Unfortunately, Mr. Wheeler ignored
the health of Delawareans. The people
of Maryland had the same concern, and
the people of Connecticut had the same
concern. He rejected all of our peti-
tions. Talk about the Golden Rule.
How is that consistent with the Golden
Rule of treating other people the way
you want to be treated? It flies in the
face of it. We thought it was unforgiv-
able.
Some of the air pollution that
crosses our border is toxic. It is coming
into our State as a silent killer. It
wasn’t too long ago that uncontrolled
fossil fuel powerplants were the largest
source of unregulated mercury and air
toxics in the country—coal-fired pow-
erplants.
For those who may not know, mer-
cury and other toxics, such as lead, ar-
senic, benzene, and acid gases, that are
emitted by uncontrolled coal-fired
powerplants get into our airways, our
waterways, and our seafood. As we
breathe and ingest these air toxics,
they build up in our bodies and cause
cancer, respiratory illness, mental im-
pairment, and even death.
Mercury pollution is especially dan-
gerous for unborn children, who can
suffer long-lasting neurological dam-
age if they are exposed during their de-
velopment at very early ages—even be-
fore they are born. The American
Academy of Pediatrics has stated there
is no safe level of mercury exposure for
children—none.
Almost two decades ago, Senator
ALEXANDER and I led legislation that
required utilities to reduce mercury
emissions by 90 percent. At the time,
most utilities told us that it could not
be done or that it would be too expen-
sive to achieve.
In 2012, which was a few years later,
the EPA implemented something
called the mercury and air toxics
standards—we call it MATS—which
also required utilities to reduce their
mercury emissions by 90 percent and
other air toxic emissions by half.
Just as with the bill introduced by
Senator ALEXANDER and me about a
decade ago, many utilities claimed
they could not meet those standards to
reduce mercury and other air toxics.
They predicted consumer rate spikes.
They predicted mass powerplant clo-
sures. They predicted brownouts. They
predicted blackouts. Luckily, those
predictions were dead wrong. Under the
2012 MATS rule, the EPA determined it
was appropriate and necessary to regu-
late air toxic plant emissions, like
mercury, lead, arsenic, acid gases, and
benzene, because of the health hazards
of these pollutants. Today, believe it or

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1553

not, 7 years later, every utility is now
in compliance with the mercury and
air toxics rule—every one.
Powerplant mercury emissions are
down by over 80 percent from just 7
years ago.
Compliance with MATS was done
faster than predicted and for one-third
the cost. Imagine that, faster than pre-
dicted, for one-third the cost, and we
have gotten better results than we
could hope for as well.
Let me go on. Consumer retail prices
are lower today than they were before
MATS was implemented. We are also
seeing health benefits, as I said, occur
faster than expected originally, and de-
spite some of the original opposition,
everyone now has embraced MATS.
Isn’t that amazing?
All these utilities and folks who op-
posed what Senator ALEXANDER and I
were trying to do a decade ago, what
the MATS rule that up to 12 years ago
was trying to do—all the folks who
were opposed to it then say: No, this is
good. It didn’t cost as much. We imple-
mented it much faster than we had
ever expected—better results than we
had expected. So it is pretty amazing,
a wonderful outcome—except over the
December holiday break 2 months ago,
for reasons unknown to me, Acting
EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler
signed a proposal to remove the legal
underpinnings of the mercury and air
toxics standards, remove the legal
underpinnings of the MATS rule.
Mr. Wheeler says this action was not
intended to get rid of the rule. He says
it was necessary and that the proposal
strikes a balance. Everyone—every-
one—industry, environmental groups,
health groups—knows that is just not
so. It is just not so.
No court has ordered this action, no
utilities are asking for this action, and
this proposal is not intended to protect
public health.
Here is what EPA has done. In the
proposal, EPA mimics flawed argu-
ments used in a recent Murray Energy
lawsuit against the MATS rule.
Like the lawsuit, EPA uses outdated
data and deems that some benefits—
like reductions in cancer, reductions in
birth defects, reduction in asthma at-
tacks—are no longer important and
shouldn’t even be considered.
Think about that. Think about that.
Based on this information, EPA deter-
mined it is no longer appropriate and
necessary for the Agency to regulate
powerplant air toxic emissions—no
longer appropriate and necessary to
regulate mercury, to regulate lead, ar-
senic, acid gases, benzene pollution
from powerplants. Imagine that.
Yet the Agency also proposes to keep
the MATS rule which regulates power-
plant air toxic emissions in place, even
though it is simultaneously saying
that the rule is not appropriate and
necessary. This confusing conclusion
opens the door for future lawsuits to
vacate the MATS rule entirely.
That is our concern—not just my
concern but a broadly held concern. By
undermining the legal foundation of
MATS, this proposal unnecessarily
puts the MATS rule in legal jeopardy,
and despite Mr. Wheeler’s claim that
he doesn’t plan to eliminate the stand-
ards themselves, EPA is still request-
ing public comment in the proposal on
whether to do just that.
If EPA is successful and the MATS
rule goes away, air pollution control
technologies on coal plants across the
country will be turned off, just like the
coal plants listed in Delaware’s 126 pe-
titions and up in Pennsylvania and I
think to our west in West VA.
On this issue, Mr. Wheeler seems to
be all alone. Environmentalists,
States, labor groups, coal-fired utili-
ties, religious leaders, the U.S. Cham-
ber of Commerce all agree that the life-
saving protections to limit mercury
pollution should stay in place. They all
agree. There are not a whole lot of
things they all agree on. They all agree
on this.
The stakeholders listed on this chart
right over here over my shoulder and
many more urge this administration
not to move forward with their pro-
posal—not to move forward. Mr. Wheel-
er has chosen to ignore the chorus of
the stakeholders who all hoped he
would chart a more responsible path.
In talking with my Republican
friends, I know many of them can’t
make sense of the EPA’s efforts to un-
dermine the MATS rule. They are as
confused as I am by why Mr. Wheeler
would be taking a step that will hurt
public health and, frankly, hurt the in-
dustries that are required to imple-
ment this technology and protect our
health.
I had hoped we could try to help Mr.
Wheeler course correct on this issue
during the nomination process. That
just doesn’t seem to be happening. His
lack of willingness to change course on
the MATS rollbacks is very troubling
to me and one of the reasons I cannot
support his nomination to be EPA Ad-
ministrator at this time.
I have fought for almost two decades
in this body to protect our children
from mercury and air toxic pollution
from powerplants. I am not going to
back down. I am not going to go away.
For my colleagues who are concerned
about regulating mercury, I would ask
that you join me in opposing Andrew
Wheeler’s nomination vote tomorrow.
I yield the floor.

CELEBRATING WOMEN’S HISTORY
MONTH
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with
great respect and admiration that I rise today
in observance of Women’s History Month and
its 2019 theme—Visionary Women: Cham-
pions of Peace and Nonviolence. Each year,
the National Women’s History Project selects
a unifying theme to recognize and promote
Women’s History Month. This year’s theme
features the stories of women from diverse
backgrounds and fields who have advocated
for peace and human rights throughout the
world.
In the United States, women of every race,
class, and ethnic background have played a
critical role in advocating for unity and peace.
For generations, women have contributed to
resolving conflicts and have worked to pro-
mote nonviolence in the workplace, schools,
homes, communities, and government.
Women have insisted upon and continue to
fight for respect, justice, and peace for all of
humanity.
Strong pioneers such as Graciela Sanchez,
Dr. E. Faye Williams, and Dorothy Cotton built
their lives upon fighting for equal rights and
eliminating racism and sexism. Leaders includ-
ing Deborah Tucker advocated for improve-
ments of laws and policies worldwide. Ms.
Tucker helped write and pass the Violence
Against Women Act of 1994. Sister Alice
Zachmann was also a trailblazer who dedi-
cated her life to ending war and violence, giv-
ing much of her time and efforts to organiza-
tions that supported the end of the Vietnam
War. In 1982, Sister Zachmann founded the
Guatemala Human Rights Commission USA
and served as its director for twenty years. For
their leadership and outstanding dedication to
women’s rights, unity, and peace, they are
well deserving of our respect and admiration.
I commend these fine women and the many
others who have fought alongside them for se-
curing rights for all women of every creed,
class, and ethnic background. These fearless
and strong women serve as remarkable role
models who reflect the 2019 theme, Visionary
Women: Champions of Peace and Non-
violence.
Madam Speaker, I am honored to join in
celebrating Women’s History Month and to
recognize that after decades of dedication,
perseverance, contributions, and advances,
great American women from all cultures and
classes are being celebrated. To illustrate the
numerous brave women of our nation’s his-
tory, we remember and recount the tales of
our ancestors’ talents, sacrifices, and commit-
ments that serve as an inspiration to today’s
generation. I ask that you and my other distin-
guished colleagues join me in celebrating
these brave women who have improved Amer-
ican society and whose stories are woven into
the fabric of our nation.

IN HONOR OF MR. JAMES AUSTIN
JENKINS, JR.
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it
is with a heavy heart and solemn remem-
brance that I pay tribute to a great man, out-
standing public servant, and dear friend of
longstanding, Mr. James Austin Jenkins, Jr.
Mr. Jenkins passed away on Thursday, Feb-
ruary 21, 2019. A funeral service will be held
on Saturday, March 2, 2019, at 12:00 p.m. at
Mount Olive Missionary Baptist Church in
Burkville, Alabama.
James Austin Jenkins, Jr. was born on De-
cember 28, 1937, to the late James Austin
Jenkins, Sr. and Octavia McCray Jenkins. A
product of the Lowndes County, Alabama
Public School System, he graduated from
Lowndes County Training School before at-
tending Alabama State University, where he
received his bachelor’s degree in Political
Science.
James built quite an impressive career as a
public servant in our nation’s federal govern-
ment which was demonstrated through his
dedicated services to the National Park Serv-
ice, as a Ranger stationed in the Washington
Monument and as a Horse Mounted Ranger at
Prince William Forest Park in Virginia, as well
as in Federal Government Law Enforcement,
and finally as a National Zoological Park Po-
lice Officer with The Smithsonian Institution.
George Washington Carver once said, ‘‘No
individual has any right to come into the world
and go out of it without leaving behind distinct
and legitimate reasons for having passed
through it.’’ We are all so blessed that Mr.
James Austin Jenkins, Jr. passed this way
during his life’s journey. As a proud member
of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc., his exu-
berant personality captured the attention of all
those he encountered and made him the life
of the party wherever he went. He will be re-
membered for his welcoming spirit and love
for his fraternity, his friends, and above all
else, his family. He leaves behind a great leg-
acy in public service to and warm cherished
memories in the lives of those who knew him.
While he was preceded in death by his par-
ents and brothers, Aaron, Frederick, and Elliot;
he is survived by his children, Karen, Earl,
Bianca, Alicia, and Nathan; and a host of fam-
ily and friends who will miss him dearly.
On a personal note, James and I both un-
derstood the importance of addressing the im-
portant issues facing our nation’s Veterans
and would discuss these issues at the Vet-
erans Brain Trust during the Congressional
Black Caucus’ Annual Legislative Conference,
which he attended regularly.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me, along with my wife, Vivian; and the more
than 730,000 residents of Georgia’s Second
Congressional District in paying tribute to Mr.
James Austin Jenkins, Jr. for his service to
our country. We extend our deepest condo-
lences to his family and friends during this dif-
ficult time of bereavement and pray that they
will be comforted by an abiding faith and the
Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and months
ahead.

Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I
rise today for Hadiya Pendleton and Blair
Holt—because they can no longer rise. Their
promising young lives were cut short by gun
violence.
I rise for Xavier Joy, Julian Gonzalez and
Delmonte Johnson and the thousands of
Americans lost to gun violence over the years.
People are dying in our cities and our rural
counties, in school classrooms and movie the-

In Waffle Houses, synagogues and on our
streets. Nowhere is safe from gun violence
and the American people are sick and tired of
it.
That’s why they sent a historic wave of gun
sense candidates to Congress with a singular
mission: do something and save lives.
Today, we will keep that promise. Today,
we will vote on legislation to ensure a back-
ground check on every gun sale.
This week, we will also vote on legislation
that would have prevented the Mother Eman-
uel tragedy.

gle bill can prevent all gun violence but each

THE UNITED STATES DAVID
O’SULLIVAN UPON HIS RETIRE-
MENT
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the distinguished service of European
Union Ambassador to the United States, David
O’Sullivan, who will retire his post at the end
of the month after nearly five years of tireless
advocacy for transatlantic unity. It has been
my privilege to work alongside Ambassador
O’Sullivan as we strive to secure our mutual
interests in national security, trade, and for-
eign affairs.
Ambassador O’Sullivan was appointed in
November 2014, shottly after receiving the EU
Transatlantic Business Award from the Amer-
ican Chamber of Commerce for his contribu-
tions to improving our economic ties with Eu-
rope. As Ambassador, he has devoted himself
to strengthening the EU–U.S. trade relation-
ship and worked to ensure that other large
economic powers play by the rules. In 2018,
he promoted a trilateral approach between the
EU, the U.S., and Japan to tackle the issue of
Chinese overcapacity in steel manufacturing.
In his four decades of public service for the
European Union, Ambassador O’Sullivan has
worked diligently for international cooperation.
Prior to serving as Ambassador, he helped es-
tablish one of the world’s largest diplomatic or-
ganizations, the European External Action
Service, and served as its Chief Operating Of-
ficer from 2011 to 2014. He held senior posi-
tions with the European Commission, including
Head of Commission President Prodi’s Cabi-
net from 1999 to 2000 and Secretary General
of the European Commission from 2000 to
2005. In his capacity as Director General for
Trade and Chief Negotiator for the Doha De-
velopment Round from 2005 to 2010, he se-
cured numerous free trade agreements, in-
cluding the conclusion ofthe EU’s agreement
with South Korea.
Born in Dublin, Ireland, the Ambassador’s
interest in global politics and international af-
fairs was first inspired by his father, Lieutenant
General Gerry O’Sullivan, who served as
Chief of Staff of the Irish Defense Forces.
While his father served as liaison to the United
Nations in the Congo in 1961, David attended
elementary school in my state of California
and later worked two summers as a YMCA
camp counselor in Chicago.
The bonds of friendship with our trans-
atlantic allies are now more important than
ever and must continue to be founded upon
our shared values of democracy, respect for
human dignity, and the rule of law. Madam
Speaker, I respectfully ask my colleagues to
join me in recognizing Ambassador
O’Sullivan’s enduring contributions to trans-
atlantic unity and EU–U.S. trade relations. I
thank him for his service and wish him a
happy retirement.

INTRODUCTION OF THE HORSE
TRANSPORTATION SAFETY ACT
OF 2019
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of the Horse Transportation Safety Act, a
bill I introduced earlier today along with Rep-
resentatives PETER KING from New York, DINA
TITUS from Nevada and BRIAN FITZPATRICK
from Pennsylvania, to ensure the humane and
safe transportation of horses.
The Horse Transportation Safety Act seeks
to end the exploitation of a regulatory loophole
designed to ban the transport of horses in
double-deck trailers. This loophole gives driv-
ers an incentive to inhumanely transport
horses to assembly points then reload them
into single level trailers just outside their final
destination.
According to the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture, ‘‘Double-deck trailers do not provide
adequate headroom for equines, with the pos-
sible exception of foals and yearlings. We do
not believe that trailers that have two or more
permanent levels that are not collapsible can
be adequately altered to accommodate adult
equines, especially tall equines.’’
This practice is not only dangerous and in-
humane to the horses, but to the traveling
public, as well. We have witnessed the dan-
gerous nature of these double decker trailers
in several horrific accidents. In October of
2007, fifteen horses died when a double deck
trailer carrying 59 Belgian draft horses over-
turned on Route 41 in Illinois. Unfortunately,
we know that accidents like this are not an un-
common occurrence.
The legislation is strongly supported by agri-
cultural interests and animal protection groups
including the Humane Society of the United
States, the Animal Welfare Institute, the Na-
tional Black Farmers Association, and Return
to Freedom Wild Horse Conservation.
Moreover, in 2010 the Committee on Trans-
portation & Infrastructure unanimously adopted
this bipartisan legislation.
This is common sense legislation, and I
urge my colleagues to support the swift pas-
sage of the Horse Transportation Safety Act.
I also want to express my gratitude for the
many years of hard work on this issue by our
esteemed colleague, the late Representative
Walter Jones from North Carolina.

CLARA LUPER
HON. KENDRA S. HORN
OF OKLAHOMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the
visionary and unwavering leadership of Civil
Rights icon and notable Oklahoman, Ms. Clara
Luper. Six months ago, I got to witness his-
tory, as Oklahoma City commemorated the
60th anniversary of the sit-ins she organized.
And even as a 5th generation Oklahoman, I
realized how little I knew.
Clara Luper and her students sparked a
movement: the sit-ins that led into our nation’s
civil rights movement. They deserve to be a
household name.
Clara Luper made her mark in a time where
people of color couldn’t even walk into the
front door of Oklahoma City businesses. They
were relegated to hidden back doors. But she
had a vision for equality, a heart for service,
and a commitment to justice. She, in her
words, ‘‘believed in a sun when it didn’t shine,
and the rain when it didn’t fall.’’ She knew that
Oklahoma and this country could be a place
where everyone is treated with respect, dig-
nity, and humanity.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E217
February 27, 2019
As a history teacher at Dunjee High School
in Spencer Oklahoma, she instilled those prin-
ciples into her students. Her steadfast commit-
ment to ending racism and systemic discrimi-
nation inspired her to organize America’s first
sit in.
In August 1958, she and 14 of her NAACP
walked up to a lunch counter they knew would
refuse them, and they ordered a hamburger
and a Coke. They were denied, but they did
not waver. They knew what was on the line.
In Ms. Luper’s words, ‘‘within that hamburger
was the whole essence of democracy.’’
At their own personal peril, they returned
each day with more people until they broke
the barrier. It was never easy. The protestors
were verbally and physically assaulted. Ms.
Luper received death threats.
Because of Ms. Luper and her students’
fearlessness and determination, Katz Drug
Stores integrated their lunch counters not just
in Oklahoma City, but in Missouri, Kansas,
and Iowa too. When the 1958 sit-in happened
in Oklahoma City, a group of college students
were inspired by what had taken place in
Oklahoma City and took note. So in 1961 the
students launched the Greensboro, N.C. sit-in
at the Woolworth lunch counter—which fueled
momentum within the civil rights movement.
It didn’t end there. For years, Ms. Luper and
others continued their fight. The sacrifices
continued too. Authorities arrested Luper 26
times during her fight for freedom.
Clara Luper empowered young people to
imagine a future brighter than their present
and taught them how to make that future a re-
ality. She changed lives and planted seeds of
ethical leadership into those who were lucky to
be mentored by her. Each of her former stu-
dents talks about the pivotal role Ms. Luper
played in instilling confidence, character, and
dignity in them.
Generations reap the benefits of her sac-
rifice and the efforts to integrate not only busi-
nesses in Oklahoma City, but educational
spaces. Ms. Luper integrated the History de-
partment at the University of Oklahoma, be-
coming the first Black graduate of that Mas-
ter’s program.
Her contributions are reflected across our
state: in a namesake scholarship program at
Oklahoma City University, a Corridor on the
northeast side of Oklahoma City, a classroom
at the University of Central Oklahoma, desig-
nating the Oklahoma City Public Schools Dis-
trict building as the Clara Luper Center, and
naming the African American studies depart-
ment at the University of Oklahoma after her.
As a lifelong Oklahoman, the representative
of the fifth Congressional District, and as an
American, I recognize how we are bene-
ficiaries of Clara Luper’s efforts to create a
more just and equitable place to live. I cannot
and will not take that history and her impact
for granted.
Although we’ve come so far because of her
sacrifices and the sacrifices of other heroes
during the Civil Rights Era, there’s still so
much work left to do. Even with the numerous
accolades given to her, the best way that we
can honor Ms. Clara Luper is to uphold her
legacy through a commitment to justice and
equality in the policies that we propose. She
knew that democracy isn’t a spectator sport. It
is our duty as a Congress and as Americans
to make good on the constitutional promise of
establishing justice and ensuring domestic
tranquility. So we must continue to work for an
inclusive, equitable place for everyone to live
and feel safe as well as build an economy
where every American has the opportunity to
thrive. I thank the sit-inners and I thank Clara
Luper, for their resilience and giving us the
torch to carry.

IN RECOGNITION OF EDWARD P.
CHAPMAN
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in recognition of the life of Edward P. Chap-
man, a decorated war veteran and Captain in
the Springfield Police Department.
Mr. Chapman was born in Brattleboro,
Vermont. In 1942 he enlisted in the United
States Marines and served in the 5th Marine
Division, 27th Marine Regiment. He defended
our country during World War II and was hon-
orably discharged in 1946 and awarded the
Purple Heart following his service fighting in
the Battle of Iwo Jima.
Upon returning home, Mr. Chapman joined
the Springfield Police Department, where he
served the people of Springfield for thirty
years. He received his degree in criminal jus-
tice from Western New England College and
later retired in the early 1980’s as a Captain
in the police department. After retiring, Mr.
Chapman remained an active member of his
community, attending mass at St. Patrick’s
Church in Springfield and belonging to Amer-
ican Legion Post No. 452, as well as fishing
and golfing in his free time.
Surrounded by family, Mr. Chapman passed
away on February 22, 2019, at the age of
ninety-four. His dedication to serving both his
country and his community will long be re-
membered by his growing family and all those
who had the great privilege of knowing Mr.
Chapman.
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor the
life of Edward P. Chapman. I ask that my col-
leagues join me in recognizing his many years
of dedication to his community.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA NON-DISCRIMINA-
TION HOME RULE ACT OF 2019
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Non-Discrimi-
nation Home Rule Act of 2019 to end the
unique applicability of the federal Religious
Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) to
the District of Columbia. My bill would protect
the District’s right to self-government, ensuring
the District is treated the same as states, and
defend LGBTQ and reproductive rights in D.C.
RFRA, which provides more protection for
religious exercise than the First Amendment
requires, applies to the federal government,
the D.C. government and the territorial govern-
ments, but not to state governments. As
RFRA does not apply to the states, under the
principles of home rule, it should likewise not
apply to the District.
While RFRA was designed to be a shield to
protect religious freedom, it is being used, as
evidenced by the Supreme Court’s 2014
Hobby Lobby decision, as a sword to discrimi-
nate against the LGBTQ community and
women. Members of Congress have used
RFRA as a justification for trying—but failing—
to overturn D.C. antidiscrimination laws.
House Republicans have repeatedly tried
since 2015 to nullify or block the District’s Re-
productive Health Non-Discrimination Act
(RHNDA), which prohibits employers from dis-
criminating against employees and their fami-
lies based on reproductive health decisions,
claiming, in part, that it violates RFRA. How-
ever, it appears that no one has challenged
RHNDA’s legality under RFRA in court.
My bill ensures that District residents are
treated the same as residents of the states
under RFRA. I strongly urge my colleagues to
support this legislation.

DENTAL AWARENESS MONTH
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in honor of National Children’s Dental Health
Month. Each February, the American Dental
Association unifies members of our healthcare
community to recognize the importance of
good oral health for our children and many
others. As a former dentist, I know that quality
dental care impacts your overall well-being.
Proper Oral Health starts with the very first
tooth as baby teeth are the building blocks to
a healthy smile.
According to the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, almost 50 percent of
children between the ages of 6 to 11 are af-
fected by tooth decay. Tooth decay also hap-
pens to be the most common chronic disease
in children. When a child suffers from dental
pain, the impact is far reaching and can affect
critical developmental stages including speak-
ing, eating and learning.
Although tooth decay is widespread, it is
preventable. It is important to brush your chil-
dren’s teeth twice a day with fluoride tooth-
paste. This year’s slogan for National Chil-
dren’s Dental Health Month is ‘‘Brush and
clean in between to build a healthy smile.’’ If
we as a society take these preventative meas-
ures to keep our children healthy, we can ulti-
mately reduce healthcare costs and give our
future generations the confidence they need in
life. Please join me in raising awareness about
the importance of oral health.

RECOGNIZING DALLAS GAY,
GAINESVILLE ROTARY CLUB’S
MAN OF THE YEAR
HON. DOUG COLLINS
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize Mr. Dallas Gay, a fel-
low Northeast Georgian who was recently
named Man of the Year by the Gainesville Ro-
tary Club in recognition of his work to combat
the opioid epidemic in Georgia.
Each year, thousands of Americans lose
their lives to opioids. Mr. Gay understands the
severity of this issue better than most, as he
lost his grandson to a drug overdose in 2012.
This tragic loss inspired him to join the fight
and ultimately save countless lives throughout
the state of Georgia.
Mr. Gay has spearheaded several drug-
related campaigns, some of which have led to
new legislation. In May 2017, the Jeffrey Dal-
las Gay Jr. Act was signed into law, making
naloxone—a life-saving antidote for drug
overdoses—available over the counter. He
also co-founded the ‘‘Think About It’’ cam-
paign, which raised awareness of addiction to
opioids and prescription drugs, and ultimately
raised over $400,000.
Mr. Gay was previously recognized by the
Medical Association of Georgia and St. Jude’s
Children’s Hospital for his work on the opioid
epidemic.
In his Man of the Year acceptance speech,
he encouraged others to continue to ‘‘be a sol-
dier’’ in combating this crisis and to question
and safeguard the drugs which are prescribed
to them.
I thank Mr. Gay for his steadfast commit-
ment to fighting this epidemic, and I look for-
ward to witnessing his continued impact on
countless lives across the state of Georgia.

IN MEMORY OF LTC (RET.) JERRY
‘‘JAY’’ WHITE II
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
OF GEORGIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it
is with a heavy heart and solemn remem-
brance that I rise today to pay tribute to a
dedicated husband, father, community servant,
and soldier, LTC (Ret.) Jerry ‘‘Jay’’ White II.
Sadly, LTC White passed away on September
20, 2018. A funeral service will be held on
Wednesday, February 27, 2019, at Old Post
Chapel at Fort Myer and will be followed by a
burial via caisson at Arlington National Ceme-
tery.
LTC White was born on September 23,
1966, to the union of U.S. Army Major General
(Ret.) Jerry and Linda (Pickens) White in St.
Mary’s, West Virginia. As a member of a mili-
tary family, LTC White attended several
schools before graduating from Leilahua High
School in Wahiawa, Hawaii, and going on the
receive a bachelor’s degree in Business from
the University of Hawaii, where he also at-
tended ROTC. He later continued his studies
and earned a masters degree in International
Affairs from The Georgia Institute of Tech-
nology.
It has been said that ‘‘Service is the rent
that we pay for the space that we occupy here
on this earth.’’ LTC White paid his rent and he
paid it well. His distinguished military career
officially commenced when he entered the
Army as a Second Lieutenant of Infantry after
graduating from the University of Hawaii. Over
the course of his career, LTC White distin-
guished himself as a great soldier. After grad-
uating from the demanding Airborne, Ranger,
and Air Assault Courses, he reported for duty
at the legendary 101st Airborne Division (Air
Assault) in Fort Campbell, Kentucky. There he
served in the 1/327 Infantry Battalion, the
same unit where his father had served during
the Vietnam War. He also excelled in leader-
ship positions and was awarded the Bronze
Star and Combat Infantryman’s Badge for his
service during the First Gulf War. His later as-
signments included duty at Fort Lewis, Wash-
ington; Paris, France, and Brussels, Belgium,
where he trained as an Army European For-
eign Area Officer; and Washington, D.C.,
where he served as a liaison officer for United
States Southern Command and later as an
advisor to the Washington, D.C. National
Guard.
Even after honorably serving his country, he
continued to give of himself in service to his
community. As an avid Washington, D.C.
sports fan, he enjoyed attending Redskins and
Nationals games as well as working with youth
by volunteering as the Braddock Road Youth
Club softball commissioner and a team coach
for many years.
LTC White achieved much in his life but
none of it would have been possible without
the love and support of his loving parents,
Jerry and Linda; his wife Jennifer; his children,
Juliana and Jameson; and a host of family
and friends that will miss him deeply.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me, my wife, Vivian; and the more than
730,000 constituents of the Second Congres-
sional District in recognizing LTC (Ret.) Jerry
‘‘Jay’’ White II for his dedicated service to our
country and his community and in extending
our condolences to his family and friends. May
they be consoled and comforted by their abid-
ing faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks

OBITUARY OF MY FATHER
WILLIAM QUIGLEY
HON. MIKE QUIGLEY
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I
rise to include in the RECORD the obit-
uary of my father William Quigley,
published in The Chicago Sun-Times on
February 10, 2019.
WILLIAM QUIGLEY, ARMY VETERAN, FATHER
OF CONGRESSMAN, DIES AT 92
Abandoned by his mother, the baby boy—
he was about 2—ended up at an Indiana or-
phanage during the Great Depression.
His luck changed when a WWI veteran and
his wife filled out the ‘‘boy or girl’’ portion
of an adoption application with the words:
‘‘any child we can love.’’
That veteran, William Earl Quigley, made
his adopted son his namesake and gave him
whatever else he could working as a handy-
man and farmhand in a rural area outside In-
dianapolis.
The origin story stayed with him always—
from when he served in the Army during the
Korean War era as a newlywed to the time he
retired with a pension from AT&T—and
formed the bedrock motivation of his life:
‘‘You work hard to give your kids a better
chance than you had.’’
On Saturday, after a long battle with Par-
kinson’s disease, Mr. Quigley, 92, died know-
ing he did just that.
His daughter Chris is a retired school su-
perintendent. His daughter Linda was a so-
cial worker. His son Dan, who passed away
two years ago, owned a used-record store.
And his son Mike is a U.S. congressman.
‘‘He didn’t like most politicians, so the
irony that his son grew up to be one was not
lost upon him,’’ said Mike Quigley, who rep-
resents Illinois’ 5th Congressional District.
Despite that fact, Mr. Quigley insisted on
standing the entire time as his son was
sworn in to the House of Representatives in
2009.
Mr. Quigley regularly wrote letters to poli-
ticians calling out ‘‘idiocy and hypocrisy’’
and dinner conversation could easily be mis-
taken for political debate at the Quigley
house.
Whatever adopted dog the family had at
the time—there were many and they were all
called ‘‘Missy’’ because it was easy to re-
member—was certainly well fed.
‘‘He’d spoil those dogs rotten, and sing to
them even, because they went through simi-
lar things as him. He knew what it was like
to be an orphan,’’ Mike Quigley said, recall-
ing his dad’s habit of mixing table scraps
with gravy and offering it to the dogs.
Mr. Quigley had a unique appreciation for
food surpluses.
‘‘When you’re hungry, you’ll eat any-
thing,’’ he recalled his father saying. ‘‘We’d
be like, ‘Yeah, right!’ And he’d never elabo-
rate, he’d just say, ‘Trust me.’ ’’
Mr. Quigley, who went by Bill, was start-
ing his second year at Purdue University
when he was drafted into the Army during
the Korean War. He married Joan Louise
Deputy in the chapel of a military training
facility in Georgia; the couple celebrated
their 67th wedding anniversary last June.
Mr. Quigley spent his post-military career
working for AT&T as a supervising engineer.
A promotion brought him to the Chicago
area in 1967. He settled in Carol Stream.
Upon retirement, he moved to Ottawa, Illi-
nois, where he volunteered at a homeless
shelter and served on the Ottawa Planning
Commission.
His hobbies included chess and reading. He
also built radios, stereos—and his family’s
first color TV.
He was also fanatical about the Indianap-
olis 500; he sported his checkered socks and
stopwatches to the race on as many as 60 oc-
casions.
‘‘To me he represented a more realistic as-
pect of the American Dream. He did it all to
put a roof over our heads and food on the
table,’’ Mike Quigley said.
‘‘He came from less than nothing and he
raised four kids. My accomplishments are a
shadow compared to what he was able to do,’’
he said.
In addition to his wife and children,
Quigley is also survived by six grandchildren
and two great-grandchildren.

CELEBRATING THE 200TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE UNITED
STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR
THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF IL-
LINOIS
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the
United States District Court for the Northern
District of Illinois. It is an honor to recognize
a court with such a rich and impactful history
at the heart of the American judiciary system.
The U.S. District Court for the Northern Dis-
trict of Illinois traces its roots back to Illinois’
establishment. Nathaniel Pope, serving as the
Territory of Illinois’ Secretary from inception in
1809, became its Delegate to Congress in
1816. There, he worked tirelessly on part of
the territory’s eventual admission to the Union
as the state of Illinois in 1818. As such, it was
only a natural progression for him to be nomi-
nated and confirmed as the first Judge of its
new District, bringing with him strong anti-slav-
ery views.
Eventually, the United States District Court
for the District of Illinois was subdivided into
the Northern and Southern District Courts in
1855. The Northern District led by its first
judge, Judge Thomas Drummond, continued
the tradition of protecting the rights of all peo-
ple. One such example, was through the sen-
tencing of the abolitionist John Hossack, who
had violated the Fugitive Slave Act by abetting
a runaway slave. Judge Drummond, conflicted
between his duty to the rule of law and his ab-
olitionist conscience, recognized Hossack was
guilty of breaking the law, but chose to hand
down a minimal sentence for the transaction.
Even as the Civil War raged on, Judge Drum-
mond balanced his sense of duty and patriot-
ism, actively supporting the Union and Presi-
dent Lincoln while still defending the Chicago
Times’ right to freedom of speech and criti-
cism.
Today the court exists as the Northern Dis-
trict of Illinois and is led by Chief Judge Rubén
Castillo. It has grown considerably during its
200 years and now contains 22 judicial posts,
ensuring further public and juris prudential ac-
cess to its resources and rulings. I am grateful
to the District Court and its people, for laws
are useless without justice.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Illinois on the 200th
anniversary of the courts establishment.
Through its celebration, we pay tribute not
only to our institutions and the rule of law, but
to our long-standing history of justice.

RECOGNIZING MARFAN
AWARENESS MONTH
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise
today on behalf of Americans affected by
Marfan syndrome and related connective tis-
sue conditions to recognize February as
Marfan Awareness Month.
Marfan syndrome is a rare genetic condi-
tion. About 1 in 5,000 Americans carries a mu-
tation in gene called fibrillin which results in an
overproduction of a protein called transforming
growth factor beta or TGFB. The increased
TGFB impacts connective tissue and since
connective tissue is found throughout the
body, Marfan syndrome features can manifest
throughout the body. Patients often have dis-
proportionately long limbs, a protruding or in-
dented chest bone, curved spine, and loose
joints. However, it is not the outward signs
that concern Marfan syndrome patients, but
the effects the condition has on internal sys-
tems. Most notably, in Marfan patients the
large artery, known as the aorta, which carries
blood away from the heart is weakened and
prone to enlargement and rupture, which can
be fatal. It is for this reason that increased
awareness of Marfan syndrome can save
lives.
While there is currently no cure for Marfan
syndrome, efforts are underway to enhance
our understanding of the condition and im-
prove patient care. I applaud the National In-
stitutes of Health, particularly the National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the Na-
tional Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal
and Skin Diseases for their research efforts in
this regard. I encourage NIH to expand re-
search efforts in this area.
Early diagnosis and proper treatment are
the keys to managing Marfan syndrome and
living a full life. I encourage my colleagues to
join me in supporting a Marfan education and
awareness program at the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention. We can facilitate
proper treatment by raising awareness leading
to early diagnosis. I urge my colleagues to join
me in recognizing February as Marfan Aware-
ness Month.

MACEDONIAN MINORITY IN
GREECE
HON. PAUL MITCHELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Mr. MITCHELL. Madam Speaker, as a co-
chair of the Congressional Macedonian Cau-
cus and representative of one of the largest
populations of Macedonian-Americans in the
country, I would like to include in the RECORD
the following article from the BBC entitled
‘‘Greece’s invisible minority—the Macedonian
Slavs’’. I’m dedicated to maintaining and
strengthening a positive and mutually bene-
ficial relationship between the United States
and Macedonia, and urge my colleagues to
join me in building and enhancing the cultural,
economic, strategic, and governmental ties be-
tween our two nations.
[From the BBC News Stories, Feb. 24, 2019]
‘‘GREECE’S INVISIBLE MINORITY—THE
MACEDONIAN SLAVS’’
By ratifying an agreement with the newly
renamed Republic of North Macedonia,
Greece has implicitly recognised the exist-
ence of a Macedonian language and eth-
nicity. And yet it has denied the existence of
its own Macedonian minority for decades,
says Maria Margaronis. Will something now
change?
Mr. Fokas, 92, stands straight as a spear in
his tan leather brogues and cream blazer,
barely leaning on the ebony and ivory cane
brought from Romania by his grandfather a
century ago. His mind and his memory are as
sharp as his outfit.
A retired lawyer, Mr. Fokas speaks impec-
cable formal Greek with a distinctive lilt:
his mother tongue is Macedonian, a Slavic
language related to Bulgarian and spoken in
this part of the Balkans for centuries. At his
son’s modern house in a village in northern
Greece, he takes me through the painful his-
tory of Greece’s unrecognised Slavic-speak-
ing minority.
Mr. Fokas takes care to emphasise from
the start that he is both an ethnic Macedo-
nian and a Greek patriot. He has good reason

to underline his loyalty: for almost a cen-
tury, ethnic Macedonians in Greece have
been objects of suspicion and, at times, per-
secution, even as their presence has been de-
nied by almost everyone. Most are reluctant
to speak to outsiders about their identity.
To themselves and others, they’re known
simply as ‘‘locals’’ (dopyi), who speak a lan-
guage called ‘‘local’’ (dopya). They are en-
tirely absent from school history textbooks,
have not featured in censuses since 1951
(when they were only patchily recorded, and
referred to simply as ‘‘Slavic-speakers’’), and
are barely mentioned in public. Most Greeks
don’t even know that they exist.
That erasure was one reason for Greece’s
long-running dispute with the former Yugo-
slav republic now officially called the Repub-
lic of North Macedonia. The dispute was fi-
nally resolved last month by a vote in the
Greek parliament ratifying (by a majority of
just seven) an agreement made last June by
the countries’ two prime ministers. When
the Greek Prime Minster, Alexis Tsipras, re-
ferred during the parliamentary debate to
the existence of ‘‘Slavomacedonians’’ in
Greece—at the time of World War Two—he
was breaking a long-standing taboo.
The use of the name ‘‘Macedonia’’ by the
neighbouring nation state implicitly ac-
knowledges that Macedonians are a people in
their own right, and opens the door to hard
questions about the history of Greece’s own
Macedonian minority.
When Mr. Fokas was born, the northern
Greek region of Macedonia had only recently
been annexed by the Greek state. Until 1913
it was part of the Ottoman Empire, with
Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia all wooing its
Slavic-speaking inhabitants as a means to
claiming the territory. It was partly in reac-
tion to those competing forces that a dis-
tinctive Slav Macedonian identity emerged
in the late 19th and early 20th Century. As
Mr. Fokas’s uncle used to say, the family
was ‘‘neither Serb, nor Greek, nor Bulgarian,
but Macedonian Orthodox’’.
In the end, the Slav Macedonians found
themselves divided between those three new
states. In Greece, some were expelled; those
who remained were pushed to assimilate. All
villages and towns with non-Greek names
were given new ones, chosen by a committee
of scholars in the late 1920s, though almost a
century later some ‘‘locals’’ still use the old
ones.
In 1936, when Mr. Fokas was nine years old,
the Greek dictator Ioannis Metaxas (an ad-
mirer of Mussolini) banned the Macedonian
language, and forced Macedonian-speakers to
change their names to Greek ones. Mr.
Fokas remembers policemen eavesdropping
on mourners at funerals and listening at
windows to catch anyone speaking or singing
in the forbidden tongue. There were lawsuits,
threats and beatings.
Women—who often spoke no Greek—would
cover their mouths with their headscarves to
muffle their speech, but Mr. Fokas’s mother
was arrested and fined 250 drachmas, a big
sum back then.
‘‘Slavic-speakers suffered a lot from the
Greeks under Metaxas,’’ he says. ‘‘Twenty
people from this village, the heads of the big
families, were exiled to the island of Chios.
My father-in-law was one of them.’’ They
were tortured by being forced to drink castor
oil, a powerful laxative.
When Germany, Italy and Bulgaria invaded
Greece in 1941, some Slavic-speakers wel-
comed the Bulgarians as potential liberators
from Metaxas’s repressive regime. But many
soon joined the resistance, led by the Com-
munist Party (which at that time supported
the Macedonian minority) and continued
fighting with the Communists in the civil
war that followed the Axis occupation. (Bul-
garia annexed the eastern part of Greek Mac-
edonia from 1941 to 1944, committing many
atrocities; many Greeks wrongly attribute
these to Macedonians, whom they identify as
Bulgarians.)
When the Communists were finally de-
feated, severe reprisals followed for anyone
associated with the resistance or the left.
‘‘Macedonians paid more than anyone for
the civil war,’’ Mr. Fokas says. ‘‘Eight peo-
ple were court-martialled and executed from
this village, eight from the next village, 23
from the one opposite. They killed a grand-
father and his grandson, just 18 years old.’’
Mr. Fokas was a student in Thessaloniki
then—but he too was arrested and spent
three years on the prison island of
Makronisos, not because of anything he’d
done but because his mother had helped her
brother-in-law escape through the skylight
of a cafe where he was being held.
Most of the prisoners on Makronisos were
Greek leftists, and were pressed to sign dec-
larations of repentance for their alleged
Communist past. Those who refused were
made to crawl under barbed wire, or beaten
with thick bamboo canes. ‘‘Terrible things
were done,’’ Mr. Fokas says. ‘‘But we
mustn’t talk about them. It’s an insult to
Greek civilisation. It harms Greece’s good
name.’’
Tens of thousands of fighters with the
Democratic Army, about half of them Slav-
ic-speakers, went into exile in Eastern bloc
countries during and after the civil war.
About 20,000 children were taken across the
border by the Communists, whether for their
protection or as reserve troops for a future
counter-attack.
Many Slavic-speaking civilians also went
north for safety. Entire villages were left
empty, like the old settlement of
Krystallopigi (Smrdes in Macedonian) near
the Albanian border, where only the impos-
ing church of St. George stands witness to a
population that once numbered more than
1,500 souls.
In 1982, more than 30 years after the con-
flict’s end, Greece’s socialist government
issued a decree allowing civil war refugees to
return—but only those who were ‘‘of Greek
ethnicity’’. Ethnic Macedonians from Greece
remained shut out of their country, their vil-
lages and their land; families separated by
the war were never reunited.
Mr. Fokas’s father-in-law and brother-in-
law both died in Skopje. But, he points out,
that decree tacitly recognised that there
were ethnic Macedonians in Greece, even
though the state never officially recognised
their existence: ‘‘Those war refugees left
children, grandchildren, fathers, mothers be-
hind. What were they, if not Macedonians?’’
It’s impossible accurately to calculate the
number of Slavic-speakers or descendants of
ethnic Macedonians in Greece. Historian Le-
onidas Embiricos estimates that more than
100,000 still live in the Greek region of Mac-
edonia, though only 10,000 to 20,000 would
identify openly as members of a minority—
and many others are proud Greek national-
ists.
The Macedonian language hasn’t officially
been banned in Greece for decades, but the
fear still lingers. A middle-aged man I met in
a village near the reed beds of Lake Prespa,
where the agreement between Greece and the
North Macedonian republic was first signed
last June, explained that this fear is passed
down through the generations. ‘‘My parents
didn’t speak the language at home in case I
picked it up and spoke it in public. To pro-
tect me. We don’t even remember why we’re
afraid any more,’’ he said. Slowly the lan-
guage is dying. Years of repression pushed it
indoors; assimilation is finishing the job.
And yet speaking or singing in Macedonian
can still be cause for harassment. Mr. Fokas’
son is a musician; he plays the haunting
Macedonian flute for us as his own small son
looks on. He and a group of friends used to
host an international music festival in the
village square, with bands from as far away
as Brazil, Mexico and Russia.
‘‘After those bands had played we’d have a
party and play Macedonian songs,’’ he says.
‘‘None of them were nationalist or separatist
songs—we would never allow that. But in
2008, just as we were expecting the foreign
musicians to arrive, the local authority sud-
denly banned us from holding the festival in
the square, even though other people—the
very ones who wanted us banned—still hold
their own events there.’’
At the last minute, the festival was moved
to a field outside the village, among the
reeds and marshes, without proper facili-
ties—which, Mr. Fokas’s son points out, only
made Greece look bad.
‘‘And do you know why the songs are
banned in the square but not the fields out-
side?’’ his father adds. ‘‘Because around the
square there are cafes, and local people could
sit there and watch and listen secretly. But
outside the village they were afraid to join
in—they would have drawn attention to
themselves by doing that.’’
The ratification of Greece’s agreement
with the Republic of North Macedonia—and
its implicit recognition of a Macedonian lan-
guage and ethnicity—is a major political
breakthrough which should help to alleviate
such fears. But the process has also sparked
new waves of anger and anxiety, with large,
sometimes violent protests opposing the
agreement, supported by parts of the Ortho-
dox church.
An election is due before the end of the
year. Greece’s right-wing opposition has
been quick to capitalise on nationalist senti-
ments, accusing the Syriza government of
treason and betrayal. For Greece’s Slavic-
speakers, who have long sought nothing
more than the right to cultural expression,
the time to emerge from the shadows may
not quite yet have arrived.
Mr. Fokas has been referred to by his first
name to protect his identity.

INTRODUCTION OF THE COREY
ADAMS SEARCHLIGHT ACT
HON. GWEN MOORE
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, this week, I
introduced the Corey Adams Searchlight Act
and I rise to urge my colleagues to support
this legislation which would establish a na-
tional Green Alert system at the Department of
Justice to provide assistance and support to
regional, state, and local officials as they work
to help locate missing veterans.
This legislation is a practical step toward
bringing missing veterans home safely.
This issue was brought to my attention by
my constituent Corey Adams. When Corey
went missing, his family knew that something
was wrong—Corey left his eyeglasses, phone,
money, and medications at his parent’s home,
where he was last seen. Despite his family fil-
ing a missing person report within hours of his
disappearance, it took eight days before the
police determined he met the critical missing
persons’ criteria. On April 7, 18 days after his
initial disappearance, Corey Adams’ body was
recovered from a pond in a local park just one
mile from his mother’s home.
After this tragedy, my state of Wisconsin be-
came the first state to create a green alert
system modeled after the ‘‘Amber’’ alert sys-
tem which has proven effective at galvanizing
public attention around abducted children. And
the system has already been used to help lo-
cate missing veterans. Delaware quickly fol-
lowed and more and more states may follow
yet.
I would like to thank the bipartisan cospon-
sors that have joined in this effort so far, Rep-
resentative FILEMON VELA, RAÚL GRIJALVA,

KIND, EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, STEVE COHEN,
ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, and DEBBIE DIN-
GELL. The bill has also garnered the endorse-
ment of Rolling Thunder National, Inc.
Madam Speaker, members of the military do
not leave their fallen behind in battle and we
should not do so when they come home. I
urge my colleagues to cosponsor this impor-
tant legislation and to work with me to see that
it is enacted in the 116th Congress.

FEBRUARY IS NATIONAL CHIL-
DREN’S DENTAL HEALTH MONTH
HON. ROBIN L. KELLY
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Madam Speaker, Feb-
ruary is National Children’s Dental Health
month—an opportunity that brings together
thousands of dedicated professionals,
healthcare providers, and educators to pro-
mote the benefits of good oral health to chil-
dren, their caregivers, teachers and many oth-
ers.
Each year, millions of Americans suffer from
untreated dental disease. Tooth decay re-
mains the most common, chronic childhood
disease. According to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, about 20 percent of
children ages 5 to 11 suffer from tooth decay,
despite the fact that it is a completely prevent-
able disease. Children from low-income fami-
lies are twice as likely to have cavities com-
pared to children from higher-income house-
holds.
Give Kids A Smile (GKAS), sponsored by
the Foundation of the American Dental Asso-
ciation, is an annual centerpiece during Na-
tional Children’s Dental Health Month. Give
Kids a Smile Day is one of the most important
events for children and dentists in this country.
Thousands of dentists and volunteers give
their time to provide free oral health education,
screenings, and treatment to underserved chil-
dren. Since 2003, more than 5.5 million chil-
dren have been cared for by more than half a
million volunteers. Programs like this will con-
tinue throughout the year.
I’m happy to have led the passage of legis-
lation that supports programs such as Give
Kids A Smile and other initiatives aimed at
providing greater access to care. The Action
for Dental Health Act supports a nationwide,
community-based movement focused on deliv-
ering care now to people suffering from dental
disease, strengthening and growing the public
and private safety net to provide more care to
more Americans, and expanding dental health
education and disease prevention within un-
derserved communities.
Ensuring that children and adults receive
accessible, quality oral health care should re-
main a priority for all of us. Thank you for sup-
porting dentistry and the oral health of our na-
tion’s most vulnerable population.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE
HONORABLE PAUL K. LEARY
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in recognition of the life of the Honorable Paul
K. Leary, who led a life committed to justice
as well as improving the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts.
Born in Boston in 1939, Judge Leary spent
his entire life in Massachusetts. After grad-
uating from Suffolk Law School, Judge Leary
worked in the Boston Municipal Court system.
He then moved on to become First Assistant
District Attorney for the Suffolk County District
Attorney’s office. Judge Leary ended his ca-
reer as First Justice of the Boston Municipal
court, where he started his career at the age
of sixteen.
Alongside his jobs in the Suffolk County Dis-
trict Attorney’s office and the Boston municipal
court, Judge Leary taught at Suffolk University
Law School and lectured at New England
School of Law. He served for a period as the
President of the National Board of Trial Advo-
cacy and was awarded their Lifetime Achieve-
ment Award in July of last year.
Judge Leary was a dedicated family man
and a staple in his community. He coached
his son’s youth hockey team in Milton all the
way to the state championship in 1980. Judge
Leary spent his summers in Pocasset, where
he could be found with family and friends,
playing golf or racquetball, or having dinner at
one of his favorite local restaurants.
Judge Leary has led a life dedicated to jus-
tice and upholding the laws of Massachusetts.

HONORING VICTIMS OF SUMGAIT
POGROM
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise to com-
memorate the 31st anniversary of the pogrom
against the Armenian residents of the town of
Sumgait, Azerbaijan. On February 27, 1988,
and for three days following, Azerbaijani mobs
assaulted and killed Armenians. The violence
left hundreds of Armenian civilians dead and
injured, women and girls were raped, and
some victims were burned alive. Thousands
were forced to flee their homes, leaving be-
hind their belongings.
The pogroms came as a direct result of
years of vicious, racist anti-Armenian propa-
ganda by Azerbaijani authorities, dehuman-
izing the Armenian residents of Azerbaijan and
laying the groundwork for mass violence. Az-
erbaijani authorities made little effort to punish
those responsible, instead attempting to cover
up the atrocities in Sumgait to this day and
denying the government role in instigating the
killings. Indeed, even today, racist propaganda
against Armenia and Armenians is prevalent in
Azerbaijan.
The hateful and dangerous Azerbaijani at-
tacks on Armenians is also seen in a horrific
crime which occurred 15 years ago last week.
At a NATO sponsored training in Budapest, an
Azerbaijani Army officer named Ramil Safarov
snuck into the room of an Armenian lieuten-
ant, Gurgen Margaryan, and hacked him to
death with an axe as he slept.
For this brutal and despicable crime,
Safarov was sentenced to life imprisonment in
Hungary. Yet after a determined campaign by
Azerbaijan’s government, he was extradited to
Baku in 2012 where he was greeted not as a
criminal but as a hero, provided back pay, and
promoted in rank. There is no more dramatic
illustration of Azerbaijan’s continued posture of
hatred and aggression towards their Armenian
neighbor than their celebration of a cold-blood-
ed murderer.
The assault on ethnic Armenian civilians in
Sumgait helped touch off what would become
a direct conflict between Armenia and Azer-
baijan which took thousands of lives and dis-
located millions more. The anniversary of
Sumgait is a reminder of the consequences
when aggression and hatred grow unchecked.
Madam Speaker, in two months we will
mark the 104th Anniversary of the Armenian
Genocide, an event the Turkish government,
Azerbaijan’s closest ally, goes to great lengths
to deny. We must not let such crimes against
humanity go unrecognized, whether they oc-
curred yesterday or 30 years ago or 100 years
ago. Today, let us pause to remember the vic-
tims of the atrocities of the Sumgait pogroms.
Madam Speaker, it is our moral obligation to
condemn crimes of hatred and to remember
the victims, in hope that history will not be re-
peated.

RECOGNIZING NACDS RXIMPACT
DAY
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize the NACDS RxIMPACT Day on
Capitol Hill that is coming up next week. This
is a special day where we will have the
chance to recognize the pharmacy industry’s
many contributions to the American healthcare
system.
Organized by the National Association of
Chain Drug Stores (NACDS), this event will
take place on March 5–6, 2019. More than
400 individuals from all 50 states representing
the pharmacy community—including practicing
pharmacists, pharmacy school faculty and stu-
dents, state pharmacy association representa-
tives, and pharmacy company leaders—will be
on Capitol Hill. They will visit every House and
Senate office to share their views with us
about the importance of supporting their ac-
cess agenda—legislative priorities that will en-
sure that our constituents will continue to have
access to more than 40,000 community and
neighborhood pharmacies across the country
and be better able to utilize pharmacists to im-
prove healthcare quality while reducing the
cost of care.
Local pharmacists are important community
leaders, who are trusted by their patients to
efficiently provide high quality, convenient
healthcare services. And as demand for
healthcare services continues to grow, phar-
macists are stepping in to fill gaps in
healthcare delivery by partnering with physi-
cians, nurses, and other healthcare providers
to address the unmet need. Moreover, phar-
macists continually innovate to provide unique
services that improve overall patient health
and wellness.
Further, in many communities the local
pharmacist is a patient’s most direct
healthcare access point. This is particularly
true in rural areas. In fact, 91 percent of Amer-
icans live within five miles of a community
pharmacy. These pharmacies bring value to
their communities by providing care to those
who need it most—older Americans and those
who manage chronic conditions, particularly in
rural and underserved areas. In addition, phar-
macists frequently work with patients to navi-
gate specific pharmacy benefits and the use of
generic substitutions to identify strategies to
save money. Pharmacists also ensure medica-
tions are administered appropriately, and offer
other preventative services that help improve
patients overall wellbeing and quality of life.
The pharmacy advocates attending NACDS
RxIMPACT Day on Capitol Hill will be edu-
cating members on their access agenda. As
we debate the future of healthcare, the phar-
macy community wishes to work with us to
help develop solutions that put pharmacy’s
value to work for patients and payers. Specifi-
cally, NACDS’s advocates will be seeking our
support for policies that will help address pre-
scription drug affordability and transparency
through much-needed reform to DIR fees, a
complicated fee structure imposed on phar-
macies to participate in the Medicare Part D
program. They will also highlight proposals de-
signed to address the opioid epidemic.
I believe Congress should work with the
2019 NACDS RxIMPACT Day on Capitol Hill
advocates to advance policies that support
pharmacists in their effort to improve care, in-
crease access, and lower costs.

RECOGNIZING DANNY RUSSELL
HON. RODNEY DAVIS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Danny Rus-
sell, the morning show host on WMKR in
Taylorville, Illinois, who is leaving the broad-
casting industry after 40 years.
Local media is so important to our commu-
nities and Danny’s service is a prime example
of this.
Danny graduated from the radio-tv program
at Lewis and Clark Community College in
Godfrey and spent 17 years as the weekend
weathercaster for WICS-TV Channel 20 in
Springfield.
His career has included stints at several
Springfield radio stations and in 2011, he
joined the Miller Media Group to become the
Morning Show host on WMKR Genuine Coun-
try 94.3.
Additionally, Danny has been the Miller
Media Group production director, host of the
Saturday Retro Request Show and the ‘‘Brown
Bag Rewind’’ show. He has also broadcast
live from countless events thru-out central Illi-
nois over his nearly 8 years with Miller Media
Group.
I congratulate Danny on 40 years of suc-
cess in the broadcasting industry, and I wish
him well on his next chapter.

SUPPORTING GUN VIOLENCE
PREVENTION LEGISLATION
HON. PETER T. KING
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in support of H.R. 8, the Bipartisan
Background Checks Act and H.R. 1112, the
Enhanced Background Checks Act. Both
pieces of legislation would close deadly loop-
holes in federal law to increase public safety.
I am proud to co-lead these important initia-
tives to reduce gun violence.
H.R. 8, which would require background
checks on all firearm purchases, is a common
sense measure that will help keep our children
and communities safe. This is particularly im-
portant with the rise of internet and gun show
sales, where prohibited purchasers can easily
skirt the law to obtain deadly firearms. This bill
would also reduce firearms trafficking through
secondary sales and enhance law enforce-
ment’s ability to trace firearms used in a
crime.
Similarly, H.R. 1112 would increase public
safety by giving background check operators
sufficient time to complete background checks.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E224 February 27, 2019
While roughly 90 percent of background
checks on gun sales are completed imme-
diately, a small amount requires additional
time for operators to discern whether a pur-
chaser is prohibited from buying a firearm.
However, under current law, if a background
check is not completed within three business
days, the sale can proceed. This loophole al-
lows thousands of prohibited purchasers each
year—including the shooter in Charleston,
South Carolina—from obtaining guns without
the completion of a background check.
H.R. 1112 would keep everyday citizens
safe by keeping firearms out of the hands of
prohibited purchasers. It would also protect
law enforcement by reducing the need for ATF
agents to retrieve guns from individuals who
shouldn’t have been allowed to purchase
them.
While there is no single measure that will
completely eliminate gun violence, these bills
take crucial steps towards reducing it. They
also protect the rights of law abiding gun own-
ers. I am proud to support these pieces of leg-
islation and encourage my colleagues to do
so.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO
OF OREGON
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, yesterday
had I been present, I would have voted in
strong support of S. 47, the Natural Resources
Management Act. I was detained due to se-
vere weather and cancelled flights in Oregon.
S. 47 is a compilation of approximately 100
public lands and natural resources bills. One
of the main provisions would provide perma-
nent authorization of the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund, which I strongly support.
Also included in this essential legislation are
three provisions that I authored to protect crit-
ical salmon and steelhead habitats in south-
western Oregon and designate more than
30,000 acres of public land as Wilderness.
H.R. 994, the Chetco River Protection Act,
would prohibit new mining claims on various
rivers and creeks in Southwestern Oregon.
The waters protected by this legislation supply
clean drinking water to thousands of residents
of Southwest Oregon and Northwest California
and are critical salmon habitat.
H.R. 999, the Devil’s Staircase Wilderness
Act, would permanently protect Devil’s Stair-
case, a remote, unspoiled area in the Coast
Range. The legislation would designate ap-
proximately 30,500 acres of Bureau of Land
Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service
(USFS) lands as Wilderness. In addition, this
legislation designates approximately 14.4
miles of the Wasson and Franklin Creeks,
which support native Coho and Chinook salm-
on, trout, and steelhead runs, as Wild and
Scenic Rivers.
H.R. 1056, the Frank and Jeanne Moore
Wild Steelhead Special Management Area
Designation Act, would designate almost
100,000 acres of public land in the Steamboat
Creek Watershed in the Umpqua National For-
est that is vitally important steelhead habitat.
The legislation would honor Frank and Jeanne
Moore’s lifelong efforts to protect the North
Umpqua River and its tributaries.
The lands protected in these bills are some
of the most beautiful, pristine, and eco-
logically-diverse areas in Oregon. To leave
these areas unprotected would be to subject
them to pollution and mining, endanger drink-
ing water for thousands of families, and dev-
astate local recreation economies.
I am proud that Congress overwhelmingly
passed this legislation and that President
Trump is expected to sign this important legis-
lation into law.

HONORING GRANT THOMPSON
HON. ANN KIRKPATRICK
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Grant Thompson, a 14 year-old
in my district who found a glitch in Apple’s
FaceTime software that allowed iPhones to be
turned into spying devices. He is a Freshman
at Catalina Foothills High School whose inter-
est in technology put him in a position to dis-
cover this critical flaw.
The flaw Grant discovered allowed a user to
be eavesdropped on before they actually ac-
cepted a call. Before his discovery, I’m sure
millions of Americans used the app completely
unaware of this very serious security and pri-
vacy violation. But Grant, his sister, and his
mom took initiative to ensure this vulnerability
was addressed, and for that, we should all be
grateful.
Grant is a lot like other freshmen—he
spends time on Instagram, he plays Fortnite,
and obviously, he enjoys FaceTiming with his
friends. He is a humble young man who told
me that he and his sister Lauren simply stum-
bled across the flaw. His mother, Michele
Thompson, supported her son and reached
out to Apple so that the flaw could be fixed,
which Apple promptly did. Michele is rightfully
proud of her son, and I am too.
Grant’s future is bright. I hear he dreams of
one day being involved in a STEM-related in-
dustry, and I have no doubt that with hard
work and his natural technology skills his
dreams will one day become a reality.
I thank Grant, Lauren, and Michele for pro-
tecting the privacy of people around the world.
I also want to thank Apple for listening to the
Thompson family and for rewarding Grant’s
work with an investment in his future. Arizo-
na’s 2nd Congressional District is excited to
watch Grant grow and thrive.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF BENJAMIN CAMACHO PALACIOS
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS
OF GUAM
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life and legacy of Com-
mand Sergeant Major Benjamin Camacho
Palacios. Mr. Palacios was a Retired U.S.
Army Command Sergeant Major and will be
fondly remembered for his many outstanding
contributions and accomplishments throughout
his military and civilian career.
A dedicated public servant, Mr. Palacios be-
came one of the most senior noncommis-
sioned officers serving with various commands
both in the U.S. and overseas. Primarily serv-
ing in leadership positions within the Armor
Career Management Field, he eventually as-
sumed duty as the United States Army Forces
Command Sergeant Major on July 27, 1998.
He was the Army’s senior ranking enlisted
Soldier in Korea when he was honored with
the South Korean Order of National Security
Merit Gwanbok Medal. Command Sergeant
Major Palacios was the first enlisted soldier to
receive the medal since the end of the Korean
War. He was also the only person who served
over five terms on the Department of Veteran
Affairs Congressional Committee Mandated
Advisory Committee for Minority Veterans
(ACMV).
On Guam and the Marianas, the personal
accomplishments and success of native sons
and daughters are celebrated and adopted as
triumphs for everyone in the community. I am
deeply saddened by the passing of Command
Sergeant Major Palacios and I join the people
of Guam in celebrating his life and legacy. My
thoughts and prayers are with his family, loved
ones, and friends. Command Sergeant Major
Palacios will be deeply missed, and his mem-
ory will live on in the hearts of the people of
Guam.

NATURAL RESOURCES
MANAGEMENT ACT
SPEECH OF
HON. RON KIND
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, February 26, 2019
Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my
support for the bipartisan National Resources
Management Act. Congress has not enacted a
public lands package of this scale since 2009,
and passage of this bill will mark a major mile-
stone for the conservation and future of Amer-
ica’s public lands. This bill will permanently
authorize the Land and Water Conservation
Fund, designate over 1 million acres of wilder-
ness, and protect over 1 million acres of land
from destructive practices.
I have supported the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund for many years and since its
creation, the Land and Water Conservation
Fund has helped preserve America’s outdoors
heritage by supporting anglers and outdoor
recreation for families in every state. Wis-
consin alone has received $211 million in
LWCF funding over the past five decades,
helping to protect the Chequamegon-Nicolet
National Forest, Ice Age National Scenic Trail,
and North Country National Scenic Trail.
I am proud that the package includes the
Migratory Birds of the Americas Conservation
Act, which reauthorizes the Neotropical Migra-
tory Bird Conservation Act to help conserve
migratory birds in rapid decline in Wisconsin
and throughout the country. The Neotropical
Migratory Bird Conservation Act provides more
than $66 million in grants to support long term
conservation, research, and habitat protection
of migratory birds.
As the founder and co-chair of the National
Parks Caucus and longtime member of the
Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus and
Congressional Sportsmen’s Caucus, I am
proud to support this legislation.

H.R. 4, THE VOTING RIGHTS
ADVANCEMENT ACT
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to voice my support for H.R. 4,
The Voting Rights Advancement Act (VRAA).
The VRAA restores the protections and en-
forcement of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) to its
former strength after being gutted by the 2013
Shelby County v. Holder Supreme Court deci-
sion. The VRAA responds to the wave of voter
suppression tactics enacted by states and lo-
calities since that decision, requiring states
with a recent history of voter discrimination to
seek federal preclearance for election
changes.
Voting is the cornerstone of our democracy
and the fundamental right upon which all our
civil liberties rest. In the previous two elec-
tions, we have seen an unprecedented in-
crease in the engagement of voter suppres-
sion tactics. Specifically, in my home state of
Texas, there have been ongoing suppression
efforts, such as including additional obstacles
for voter registration, cutbacks on early voting,
and stricter voter identification requirements.
The VRAA will counteract these unfair prac-
tices by requiring a nationwide, practice-based
preclearance for ‘‘known discriminatory prac-
tices,’’ such as the creation of at-large dis-
tricts, inadequate multilingual voting materials
and cuts to polling places. The VRAA will also
increase transparency by requiring reasonable
public notice for voting changes. Finally, the
bill will allow the Attorney General authority to
request federal observers to be present any-
where in the country where a serious threat to
voter access and fair elections exists.
The reality is that we continue to see a
number of significant obstacles to the free and
fair exercise of the right to vote. Congress
must do everything in its power to ensure that
all Americans have the opportunity to exercise
their constitutional right to vote. I support this
critical legislation, and I urge my colleagues to
vote for this bill as well.

TRIBUTE TO HENRY LEE JONES
HON. GWEN MOORE
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, February 27, 2019
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize a man of faith, Henry Lee Jones.
He was a husband, father, grandfather and
entrepreneur from the Fourth Congressional
District of Wisconsin. Henry Lee Jones was
born on July 19, 1943 in Aberdeen, Mis-
sissippi to the union of Elloyd and Rohdana
Jones and passed away on February 18,
2019.
Mr. Jones moved to Milwaukee in his late
teens and was employed by A. O. Smith as a
welder for 12 years. In 1975, Henry and Bob-
bie’s Bungalow was established on the cor-
ners of 14th Street and Keefe Avenue in Mil-
waukee. The restaurant featured specialties
such as a variety of soul food, BBQ seafood
and scrumptious desserts. The Bungalow’s
signature dessert is peach cobbler.
The Bungalow Restaurant provided catering
services to many individuals in the community,
as well as businesses and organizations. One
of the most famous organizations he catered
to was the Green Bay Packer franchise. In
fact, as quoted in the Shepherd Express
Newspaper, ‘‘The authenticity of Bungalow’s
Southern-styled menu heavy on pork, chicken,
beef and fish has even captured the attention
of the Green Bay Packers. Members of the
Green & Gold have had Bungalow employees
truck their soulful grub to Green Bay for many
years now. Whether ordered from Lambeau
Field or the Bungalow’s cozy brick building,
options abound. You’ll find relatively rare
dishes such as oxtails and smoked ham hocks
in addition to more common fare like fried
chicken, steak and catfish. And though the
Bungalow staff takes pride in making healthy
meat and sides, including yams, turnip greens
and okra, one can still order ‘‘gravy, gravy and
more gravy.’’ Even if you don’t spot a Packer
on a day you visit this establishment, you can
still enjoy the many autographed photos on
the walls.
As a successful entrepreneur, he was in-
spired to expand his business to other loca-
tions across the city of Milwaukee and Keno-
sha. He was never a complainer but rather a
doer. Mr. Jones’ children share his passion
and continue to carry on his legacy and busi-
ness.
He married Bobbie Jones on July 29, 1967
and their union was blessed with 5 sons:
Henry, Jr., Milton, Rodney, Demetrius and
Lavial. Henry was preceded in death by his
parents. He leaves many family and friends to
cherish his memory including his wife Bobbie
Jones and Children: Mitch Malone, Richard
Jones, Henry Jones Jr., Milton Jones. Deme-
trius (Nichole) Jones and Lavial Jones; Sib-
lings: Dorothy (John) Williams, Delores Tools,
Elloyd (Parline) Jones, Yvonne Jones; Grand-
children: Latoya (Emmanuel) Amoah,
Deaquann Forrest, Vegas Jones, Naytosha
Jones, Xavier Jones, Corey Malone, Britany
Malone, Marcus Malone and Cortez Malone; 6
great grandchildren and a host of nieces,
nephews and other relatives.
Henry had a significant impact on the com-
munity who not only enjoyed his cooking but
his loving and joking spirit as well. He was a
pillar of the community, the patriarch of his
family. I have known Mr. Jones for over 30
years, well before I began my legislative ca-
reer and he was my friend. He has made a
positive impact on Milwaukee and it is truly an
honor for me to pay homage to someone who
has contributed so much to Milwaukee and the
State of Wisconsin.
Madam Speaker, for these reasons I rise to
pay tribute to a man whose legacy will con-
tinue to benefit the Fourth Congressional Dis-
trict.
