ment should supersede the language in the

port and the Senate Report should be com-
plied with and carry the same emphasis as
the language included in the explanatory
statement. In providing the operating plan
required by section 516 of this Act, the De-
partments and agencies funded in this Act
are directed to include all programs,
projects, and activities, including those in

nize activities except as provided herein.

are displayed in the detailed table at the end
of the explanatory statement for this divi-
sion. Funding levels that are not displayed
in the detailed table are identified within
this explanatory statement. Any action to
eliminate or consolidate programs, projects,

proposal in the President’s Budget so it can
be considered by the Committees on Appro-
priations of the House of Representatives
and the Senate.

support and incentivize center operators to
build and enhance partnerships between cen-
ters and other training sites to enhance op-
portunity and work experiences for students
in underserved rural or remote communities
as well as in urban settings. Such partner-
ships should use student-focused industry-

dents the opportunity to take coursework
leading to college credit, and demonstrate
strong employer partnerships within the re-
gion in which the center is located.

ment’s public health preparedness and re-
sponse programs and looks forward to con-
sidering and evaluating the Department’s
proposal to shift the funding and oversight of
the SNS from CDC to the Assistant Sec-
retary for Preparedness and Response
(ASPR), as submitted in the fiscal year 2019
budget request. The Committees note that
CDC has unique expertise in public health
preparedness and response, science-based
policy and decision making, public health
communications, and coordination with
State and local partners. Should the pro-
posed move be implemented, the Secretary is
strongly urged to maintain a strong and cen-
tral role for CDC in the medical counter-
measures enterprise.

the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in-
cluding $496,000,000 from the 21st Century
Cures Act (P.L. 114–255), an increase of
$3,000,000,000, or 8.8 percent, above fiscal year
2017.
The agreement continues the commitment
to funding research on Alzheimer’s disease
and increases funding by $414,000,000 to a
total of $1,828,000,000 in fiscal year 2018; in-
creases funding for the All of Us precision
medicine initiative by $60,000,000; increases

the agreement includes $500,000,000 for tar-
geted research on opioid addiction within the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders
and Stroke (NINDS) and the National Insti-
tute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and encourages
NIDA to commit additional funding to this
effort from within its base budget. It also in-
cludes a new initiative to expand research
into Down syndrome. In addition, a funding
increase above fiscal year 2017 is provided to
every Institute and Center to continue in-
vestments in research that will save lives,
lead to new drug and device development, re-
duce health care costs, and improve the lives
of all Americans.
The agreement appropriates funds author-
ized in the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–
255). Per the authorization, $300,000,000 is
transferred to the National Cancer Institute
for cancer research; $43,000,000 to NINDS and
$43,000,000 to the National Institute on Men-
tal Health (NIMH) for the BRAIN Initiative;
and $110,000,000 will be allocated from the
NIH Innovation Fund, in this agreement re-
flected in the Office of the Director, for the
Precision Medicine Initiative cohort
($100,000,000) and regenerative medicine re-
search ($10,000,000).
The agreement increases funding for Clin-
ical and Translational Science Awards to
$542,771,000; increases funding for Institu-
tional Development Awards to $350,575,000;
and continues to support the National Chil-
dren’s Study Follow-on program at
$165,000,000.
The Common Fund is supported as a set-
aside within the Office of the Director at
$588,116,000, plus an additional $12,600,000 to
support pediatric research as authorized by
the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act
(P.L. 113–94).
The agreement expects the 8.8 percent in-
crease of funds over the fiscal year 2017 level
to support an increase in the number of new
and competing Research Project Grants.
The agreement expects that NIH will con-
tinue its focus on emerging investigators and
first-time renewals of these young investiga-
tors with actions to significantly reduce the
average age of an NIH-supported new investi-
gator.
The agreement expects NIH to support an
increase in the number of Ruth L.
Kirschstein National Research Service
Awards and to provide a stipend level and in-
flationary increase to grantees that is at
least consistent with the fiscal year 2018
Federal employee pay raise.
NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE (NCI)
Heavy Ion Cancer Therapy and Research.—
The agreement supports NIH’s continued ex-
ploration of advanced therapeutic cancer re-
search, specifically heavy ion irradiation
technology. Heavy ion technology will intro-
duce a novel treatment option to cancer pa-
tients that is currently not available in the
U.S. The agreement notes that the U.S.
stands to be a world leader in this advanced
research. The agreement encourages NIH to
explore further the development of a state of
the art heavy ion research facility in the
U.S. Furthermore, the agreement encourages
NIH to work with the Departments of De-
fense and Energy, and other applicable Fed-
eral agencies to equip the first U.S. heavy
ion research center. The agreement urges
NIH to capitalize on the expertise and poten-
tial of recently awarded heavy ion facility
planning grant recipients in order to foster a
multidisciplinary approach and advance
heavy ion research that would produce novel,
cutting edge treatments for cancer patients.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND
DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES (NIDDK)
National Commission on Digestive Dis-
eases.—The agreement requests an update on
the implementation and recommendations of
the National Commission on Digestive Dis-
eases report entitled ‘‘Opportunities & Chal-
lenges in Digestive Diseases’’’ in the fiscal
year 2020 Congressional Justification.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL
DISORDERS AND STROKE (NINDS)
Opioids Research.—The agreement in-
cludes $250,000,000 for targeted research re-
lated to opioid addiction, development of
opioid alternatives, pain management, and
addiction treatment.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND
INFECTIOUS DISEASES (NIAID)
Universal Influenza Vaccine.—The agree-
ment directs NIAID to allocate not less than
$100,000,000 in fiscal year 2018 to advance
basic, translational, and clinical research
necessary to develop a universal influenza
vaccine. To date, 128 children have died from
influenza this season, and the hospitalization
rate this season is among the highest since
the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion began collecting these data in 2010. In
response to the severity of the 2017-2018 in-
fluenza season, the agreement encourages
NIAID to continue to prioritize investment
in the basic and clinical scientific research
necessary to develop a universal influenza
vaccine.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL
SCIENCES (NIGMS)
Science Education Partnership Awards
(SEPA).—The agreement expects SEPA to
receive not less than $19,498,000, which is the
fiscal year 2017 level plus the proportional
share of the general increase provided to
NIGMS.
EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE
OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
(NICHD)
Birth Settings Study.—The agreement
notes that rates of home and birth center
births continue to rise and there is ongoing
need for further study on issues related to
the choice of birth setting. Therefore, NICHD
is directed to enter into an agreement with
the National Academy of Sciences to provide
an evidence-based analysis of the complex
findings in the research on birth settings, in-
cluding but not limited to: definitions and
assessment of risk factors; access to and
choice in birth settings; social determinants
that influence risk and outcomes in varying
birth settings; financing models for child-
birth across settings; and the licensing,
training, and accreditation issues impacting
professionals providing maternity care
across all settings.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTHRITIS AND MUS-
CULOSKELETAL AND SKIN—DISEASES—(NIAMS)
Dermatology Branch.—The agreement re-
flects the move of the Dermatology Branch
from NCI to NIAMS.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE (NIDA)
Opioid Research.—The agreement includes
$250,000,000 for targeted research related to
opioid addiction, development of opioid al-
ternatives, pain management, and addiction
treatment. The agreement commends the
NIH Director for initiating a Public-Private
Partnership to develop new medications to
respond to the opioid crisis, but notes, how-
ever, that NIH has failed to identify addi-
tional funding within the NIH’s budget for
efforts to address the opioid crisis. Pres-
ently, NIDA allocates 15 percent of its an-
nual budget to researching issues related to
opioid addiction, arguably one of the great-
est public health threats facing the nation
today. While a significant improvement com-
pared to previous years, in addition to the
new opioid research funding provided by this
agreement, NIH is strongly encouraged to
explore opportunities for committing addi-
tional resources from the significant base
funding included in the agreement for NIDA.
It is understood that $141,000,000 in expiring
grant awards will become available for new
competing awards in fiscal year 2018.
NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON MINORITY HEALTH AND
HEALTH DISPARITIES (NIMHD)
Research Centers in Minority Institutions
(RCMIs).—The agreement continues to sup-
port the core mission of RCMIs to develop
new investigators from under-represented
communities and to conduct world-class bio-
medical research that emphasizes minority
health and health disparities. The agreement
expects the RCMIs to receive not less than
$61,478,000, which is the fiscal year 2017 level
plus the proportional share of the general in-
crease provided to NIMHD.
NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING
TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES (NCATS)
Clinical and Translational Science Awards
(CTSA) Program.—The bill provides
$542,771,000, an increase of $26,651,000, for the
CTSA program.— The agreement continues
to support the program, a stabilization in
the number of hubs funded, and a five year
grant cycle.— The agreement acknowledges
the positive changes made to the program in
response to language included in the fiscal
year—2018 Senate Report, including the in-
crease in communication and collaboration
with the Committees on Appropriations of
the House of Representatives and the Sen-
ate.— The agreement expects the Director to
provide quarterly updates to principal inves-
tigators of CTSA hubs beginning within 30—
days of enactment of this Act and to con-
tinue the ongoing updates to the Commit-
tees.— Finally, the agreement expects writ-
ten notification to continue to be provided
to the Committees at least three days in ad-
vance of any public release of CTSA grant
awards.
OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR
Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act.—
The agreement continues bill language for
specific funds authorized by the Gabriella
Miller Kids First Research Act—(P.L.—114-
255) within the Common Fund to support the
fourth year of the 10-year Pediatric Research
Initiative. The agreement requests an update
in the fiscal year 2020 Congressional Jus-
tification on this effort as described in the
House and Senate Reports.
Down Syndrome.—The agreement directs
the NIH Director to develop a new trans-NIH
initiative-involving, at a minimum, NICHD,
NIA, and NCI-to study trisomy 21, with the
aim of yielding scientific discoveries to im-
prove the health and neurodevelopment of

individuals with Down syndrome and typical
individuals at risk for Alzheimer’s disease,
cancer, cardiovascular disease, immune sys-
tem dysregulation, and autism, among oth-
ers.—This initiative shall bring together re-
search results that will be available to aca-
demic researchers, nonprofit organizations,
and industry researchers. Funding for this
trans-NIH initiative will supplement, not
supplant, existing NIH funding levels for
Down syndrome research.— The agreement
directs NIH to report to the Committees on
Appropriations of the House of Representa-
tives and the Senate within—180 days of en-
actment of this act on the structure, leader-
ship, and key areas of focus for the new
trans-NIH initiative for fiscal years 2018
through 2022.
Strategic Plan for Autism Spectrum Dis-
order (ASD).—The agreement notes the re-
lease of the 2016 2017 Interagency Autism Co-
ordinating Committee (IACC) Strategic Plan
for Autism Spectrum Disorder and encour-
ages NIH to consider the IACC’s rec-
ommendations regarding future research re-
lated to ASD.
Clinical Trials Definition.—The agreement
appreciates efforts NIH has taken to increase
transparency and improve oversight of its
clinical trials and recognizes that the results
of NIH-funded clinical trials have not always
been reported in a timely manner, reducing
the potential benefit from the findings. The
agreement urges NIH to continue to address
this problem through enhanced registration
and reporting through ClinicalTrials.gov.
There is concern, however, that in address-
ing this issue, many fundamental research
studies involving human participants are
being redefined as clinical trials without suf-
ficient notification and consultation with
this segment of the research community.
Fundamental research is critical to the NIH
mission and of value to the public, and there
is concern that policy changes could have
long-term, unintended consequences for this
research, add unnecessary regulatory bur-
dens, and substantially increase the number
of studies in the clinicaltrials.gov database
that are not clinical trials. For fiscal year
2018, the agreement directs NIH to delay en-
forcement of the new policy published in the
Federal Register on September 21, 2017—in-
cluding NIH’s more expansive interpretation
of ‘‘interventions’’’—in relation to funda-
mental research projects involving humans.
The new policy should go forward for re-
search projects that would have been consid-
ered clinical trials under the prior policy.
This delay is intended to provide NIH suffi-
cient time to consult with the basic research
community to determine the reporting
standards best suited to this kind of re-
search. The agreement directs NIH to pro-
vide the Committees on Appropriations of
the House of Representatives and the Senate
a plan and schedule for soliciting comments
and input from the research community
within 30 days of enactment of this act, and
brief the Committees on the results of these
consultations and next steps by June 22, 2018.
Frontotemporal Degeneration (FTD).—The
agreement strongly encourages NIH main-
tain and expand a multi-site infrastructure
and network of clinical sites to extend the
study of genetic and sporadic FTD cohorts.
By supporting research in this way, we may
increase our knowledge of the natural his-
tory of the disease by building an infrastruc-
ture for biomarker discovery and clinical
trials in defined FTD cohorts. A key compo-
nent of this infrastructure includes support
for a bioinformatics framework that will en-
able broad data sharing with the research
community to advance disease modeling, and
target and pathway discovery for thera-
peutic development. The agreement also rec-
ommends NIH prepare plans of action to in-
crease research and treatment initiatives as
they pertain to all forms of dementia, in-
cluding challenges faced by those with
younger onset and non-amnestic forms of the
disease.
Office of Research on Women’s Health
(ORWH).—The agreement recognizes the con-
tinuing importance of the ORWH, and the
valuable role it plays in ensuring clinical
and basic research accurately reflects the ra-
cial, ethnic, age, sex and gender diversity
necessary to provide generalizable data on
the safety and efficacy of new medical prod-
ucts and the applicability of NIH-funded re-
search to all Americans. It is anticipated
that funding for ORWH will be assigned the
priority merited by the important mission it
advances and reflect growth in the overall
NIH budget.
SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH
SERVICES ADMINISTRATION (SAMHSA)
The agreement encourages SAMHSA to in-
clude as eligible applicants in new funding
opportunity announcements, States, polit-
ical subdivisions of States, Indian tribes or
tribal organizations, health facilities, or pro-
grams operated by or in accordance with a
contract or grant with the Indian Health
Service, or other public or private nonprofit
organizations. The agreement strongly en-
courages SAMHSA to exercise maximum
flexibility when developing funding oppor-
tunity announcements to ensure that all eli-
gible applicants may apply.
The agreement urges the Assistant Sec-
retary to ensure that all training require-
ments specified by 21 U.S.C.
823(g)(2)(G)(ii)(IV) are meaningfully ad-
dressed.
MENTAL HEALTH

Clinics.—The agreement includes $100,000,000
and directs SAMSHA to prioritize resources
to entities within States that are part of the
section 223(a) of the Protecting Access to
Medicare Act of 2014 (P.L. 113–93) demonstra-
tion and to entities within States that were
awarded planning grants. SAMHSA is en-
couraged to coordinate these resources with
its efforts on substance use disorders.
SAMHSA shall conduct an evaluation of the
program and provide a report to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate not later than 15
months after the date of enactment of this
Act.
Children’s Mental Health Services.—The
agreement includes a new 10 percent set-
aside for an early intervention demonstra-
tion program with persons not more than 25
years of age at clinical high risk of devel-
oping a first episode of psychosis. SAMHSA
is directed to work with NIMH on the imple-
mentation of this set-aside.

Infant and Early Childhood Mental
Health.—The agreement includes $5,000,000
for infant and early childhood mental health
promotion, intervention, and treatment as
authorized in section 10006 of the 21st Cen-
tury Cures Act (P.L. 114–255).
Mental Health First Aid.—When SAMHSA
issues new competitive funding opportuni-
ties, SAMHSA is directed to include as eligi-
ble grantees local law enforcement agencies,
fire departments, and emergency medical
units with a special emphasis on training for
crisis de-escalation techniques. SAMHSA is
also encouraged to prioritize training for
veterans, armed services personnel, and their
family members.
Project AWARE.—The agreement provides
$71,000,000, an increase of $14,000,000 for
Project AWARE, a program which raises
awareness of mental health issues and con-
nects young people experiencing behavioral
health issues, as well as their families, with
needed services. Of the amount provided for
Project AWARE, the agreement provides not
less than $10,000,000 for discretionary grants
to support efforts in high-crime, high-pov-
erty areas and, in particular, communities
that are seeking to address relevant impacts
and root causes of civil unrest. These grants
should maintain the same focus as fiscal
year 2017 grants. The agreement requests a
report on progress of fiscal year 2017 grant-
ees 180 days after the enactment of this Act.
SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT
21st Century Cures.—The agreement notes
concern that SAMHSA has restricted State’s
flexibility for addressing the opioid crisis by
limiting the amount of funding that can be
used for opioid prevention activities. The
agreement recommends States be given
flexibility within the existing grant program
authorized in section 1003(b)(3) of the 21st
Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255) to direct re-
sources in accordance with local needs. The
agreement requests a report to the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate on such plans
and evaluation results available on this pro-
gram, one year after enactment of this Act.
State Opioid Response Grants.—The agree-
ment provides $1,000,000,000 in new funding
for grants to States to address the opioid cri-
sis. This funding is in addition to the
$500,000,000 provided in the 21st Century
Cures Act. Bill language provides $50,000,000
for grants to Indian tribes or tribal organiza-
tions. In addition, the agreement provides a
15 percent set-aside for States with the high-
est age-adjusted mortality rate related to
opioid use disorders. The Assistant Secretary
is encouraged to apply a weighted formula
within the set-aside based on state ordinal
ranking. The agreement urges the Assistant
Secretary to ensure the formula avoids a sig-
nificant cliff between States with similar
mortality rates. SAMHSA shall submit to
the Committees on Appropriations of the
House of Representatives and the Senate a
work plan of the proposed allocation of funds
not later than 30 days prior to awarding
grants.
In addition, not later than one year after
the date of enactment of this Act, SAMHSA

shall submit a report to the Committees on
Appropriations of the House of Representa-
tives and the Senate that includes a descrip-
tion of the activities for which each State
has received funding and the ultimate recipi-
ents of the funds provided to States. In addi-
tion, SAMHSA shall submit an evaluation of
the program not later than two years after
the date of enactment of this Act. SAMHSA
is directed to make the report and evalua-
tion publicly available on SAMHSA’s
website.
National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Re-
view.—Within the total for administration,
technical assistance, and evaluation, pro-
vided to SAMHSA for the State Opioid Re-
sponse Grants, the agreement includes
$2,000,000 to charter a NAS review within 90
days of enactment of this Act. The NAS re-
view will identify outcomes that are to be
achieved by activities authorized in the
Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act
(P.L. 114–198) and the metrics by which the
achievement of such outcomes shall be de-
termined, as required by section 701 of such
Act. The NAS study should report on the ef-
fectiveness of the programs in achieving
their respective goals for preventing, treat-
ing, and supporting recovery from substance
use disorders. The NAS study will result in
the public availability of program level data
and recommendations to Congress con-
cerning the appropriate allocation of re-
sources to such programs to ensure cost-ef-
fectiveness in the Federal government’s re-
sponse to the opioid addiction epidemic. It is
expected that an interim report will be com-
pleted within three years after enactment of
this Act, and a final report will be completed
within five years after enactment of this
Act.

agreement provides $84,000,000 for the Medi-
cation-Assisted Treatment for Prescription
Drug and Opioid Addiction program.
SAMHSA is directed to include as an allow-
able use medication-assisted treatment and
other clinically appropriate services to
achieve and maintain abstinence from all
opioids and heroin. SAMHSA is directed to
give preference in grant awards to treatment
regimens that are less susceptible to diver-
sion for illicit purposes. These grants should
target States with the highest age adjusted
rates of admissions, including those that
have demonstrated a dramatic age adjusted
increase in admissions for the treatment of
opioid use disorders. Within the total, the
agreement includes $5,000,000 for grants to
Indian tribes, tribal organizations, or con-
sortia.
Minority Fellowship Program.—With the
$1,000,000 increase provided, the agreement

search.—The agreement includes $1,000,000
within the total for Program Management to
contract with an independent entity to study
health services and primary care research
supported by Federal agencies since fiscal
year 2012. This study should identify re-
search gaps and areas for consolidation, as
well as propose strategies for better coordi-
nation of the Federal health services re-
search enterprise. AHRQ shall provide a re-
port to the Committees on Appropriations of
the House of Representatives and the Senate
on the status of this study within one year of
enactment of this Act.
CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID
SERVICES (CMS)
PROGRAM MANAGEMENT
Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment Sys-
tem.—The agreement notes that CMS re-
cently finalized the payment rates under the
Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment Sys-
tem for calendar year 2018. CMS is directed
to submit a report within 180 days of enact-
ment of this Act to the Committees on Ap-
propriations of the House of Representatives
and the Senate. Such report should include a
detailed justification of the payment meth-
odology for Interventional Pain Ambulatory
Surgical Centers.
Assistive Technology.—The agreement en-
courages CMS to support efforts by State
Medicaid programs to partner with State As-
sistive Technology Act Programs to develop
and implement reutilization programs with a
goal of containing Medicaid costs.
Cost Plans.—The agreement supports ef-
forts that ensure beneficiaries enrolled in a
Medicare Cost Plan subject to a transition in
contract year 2019 are either deemed from
the Cost Plan to one of its Medicare Advan-
tage plans, seamlessly transitioned to a new
Medicare Advantage plan, or transitioned to
Medicare Fee-for-Service without disruption
to care. The agreement requests the Sec-
retary notify beneficiaries enrolled in Medi-
care Cost Plans as of January 1, 2018, if their
plan will not be available, and notify bene-
ficiaries of available educational resources
not later than June 1, 2018. The agreement
requests CMS inform impacted beneficiaries
of their coverage options for January 1, 2019,
as early as practicable.
Durable Medical Equipment.—The agree-
ment encourages CMS to promulgate the
pending Interim Final Rule entitled ‘‘Dura-
ble Medical Equipment Fee Schedule, Ad-
justments to Resume the Transitional 50/50
Blended Rates to Provide Relief in Non-Com-
petitive Bidding Areas.’’
Health Insurance Exchange Trans-
parency.—The agreement continues to in-
clude bill language in section 220 that re-
quires CMS to provide cost information for
the following categories: Federal Payroll and
Other Administrative Costs; Exchange-re-
lated Information Technology (IT); Non-IT
Program Costs, including Health Plan Ben-
efit and Rate Review, Exchange Oversight,
Payment and Financial Management, Eligi-
bility and Enrollment; Consumer Informa-
tion and Outreach, including the Call Center,
Navigator Grants and Consumer Education
and Outreach; Exchange Quality Review;
Small Business Health Options Program and
Employer Activities; and Other Exchange
Activities. Cost information should be pro-
vided for each fiscal year since the enact-
ment of the Patient Protection and Afford-
able Care Act (P.L. 111–148). CMS is also re-
quired to include the estimated costs for fis-
cal year 2019.
Mental Health Providers.—The agreement
is aware that Medicare beneficiaries have
limited access to substance use disorder and
mental health services, particularly in rural
and underserved areas. The agreement notes

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2704 March 22, 2018
concern about the shortage of eligible men-
tal health providers for the Medicare popu-
lation and supports efforts to explore the ex-
pansion of the mental and behavioral health
workforce.
Recovery Audit Contractors.—The agree-
ment requests a briefing on the Recovery
Audit Contractor program for the Commit-
tees on Appropriations of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate within 60 days of
enactment of this Act.
Risk Corridor Program.—The agreement
continues bill language to prevent the CMS
Program Management appropriation account
from being used to support risk corridor pay-
ments. The agreement directs CMS to pro-
vide a report starting with plan year 2014 to
the Committees on Appropriations of the
House of Representatives and the Senate de-
tailing the receipts and transfer of payments
for this program.
Telehealth.—The agreement reaffirms the
request under this heading in Senate Report
115–150 for a report within one year of enact-
ment of this Act. The agreement directs the
Administrator to consult with Telehealth
Centers of Excellence and other relevant
agencies and stakeholders.
ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES
(ACF)
LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE
The agreement includes an increase of
$250,000,000 for the Low Income Home Energy
Assistance Program (LIHEAP). LIHEAP pro-
vides critical assistance to help low-income
households keep up with home energy costs,
which is particularly valuable for geographic
regions that experience extreme tempera-
tures in the winter and summer months.
REFUGEE AND ENTRANT ASSISTANCE
Refugee Support Services.—The agreement
accepts the Administration’s proposal to
consolidate funding from Social Services,
Preventive Health, and Targeted Assistance
into Refugee Support Services. The agree-
ment expects activities funded under these
three lines in fiscal year 2017 to continue in
fiscal year 2018 at the same funding level as
fiscal year 2017.
Transitional and Medical Services.—The
agreement provides a funding level con-
sistent with the current estimates of eligible
arrivals. The agreement affirms the expecta-
tions outlined in Senate Report 115–150, in-
cluding ACF maintaining the number of
months refugees are eligible for benefits.
Unaccompanied Children.—The agreement
directs HHS to provide a joint briefing with
the Departments of Homeland Security and
State, within 45 days of enactment of this
Act, to the Committees on Appropriations of
the House of Representatives and the Senate.
The briefing should outline the Administra-
tion’s current and planned policies that im-
pact the resources needed for this program.
Victims of Trafficking.—The agreement in-
cludes $17,000,000 for services for foreign na-
tional victims and $6,755,000 to improve serv-
ices available for U.S. citizens and legal per-
manent residents. Within the total of
$23,755,000, the agreement includes $1,750,000
for the National Human Trafficking Hotline
program, an increase of $250,000.
PAYMENTS TO STATES FOR THE CHILD CARE AND
DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT
The agreement includes a $2,370,000,000 in-
crease for the Child Care and Development
Block Grant (CCDBG) Act. It is expected
that this increase will support the full imple-
mentation of the CCDBG Act as reauthorized
in 2014, including activities to improve the
quality and safety of child care programs, in-
creasing provider reimbursement rates, and
ensuring health and safety standards are
met. The Department should work with
States to ensure they are fully in compliance
with, and meeting the goals of, the CCDBG
Act. Further, the Department should work
with States to ensure they are aware of the
availability of funds under current law to
make minor improvements to facilities to
bring them into compliance with health and
safety requirements and improve profes-
sional development for the child care work-
force. Finally, the Department should work
with States to ensure they are meeting the
needs of families with non-traditional work
hours. The funding will also increase access
to affordable, high-quality child care to
more low-income, working families.
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES SERVICES PROGRAMS
Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act
(CAPTA) Infant Plans of Safe Care.—The
agreement provides an increase of $60,000,000
for CAPTA State Grants. Within the in-
crease, the agreement directs States to
prioritize infant plans of safe care, including
compliance with the requirements in section
106(b)(2)(B)(iii) of CAPTA. The incidence of
neonatal abstinence syndrome has increased
as the opioid crisis has worsened, and this
funding is intended to help States improve
their response to infants affected by sub-
stance use disorder and their families. The
agreement also directs HHS to provide the
necessary technical assistance, monitoring,
and oversight to assist and evaluate State’s
activities on plans of safe care. The agree-
ment requests an update on those activities
in the fiscal year 2020 Congressional Jus-
tification.
Child Abuse Discretionary Activities.—The
agreement notes the lack of knowledge re-
garding effective and appropriate text-based
and chat-based intervention and education
services for child abuse victims and con-
cerned adults as these new communication
channels increase in prevalence. Therefore,
the agreement includes $1,000,000 for an ex-
tramural grant to develop and expand text
and chat capabilities and protocols for a Na-
tional child abuse hotline to determine best
practices in appropriate communication,
identity verification, privacy protection, and
resource sharing with youth seeking assist-
ance. In awarding the grant, ACF is directed
to prioritize ability to coordinate with other
hotlines administered by ACF.
Community Economic Development.—The
agreement directs ACF to issue a funding op-
portunity announcement prioritizing appli-
cations from rural areas with high rates of
poverty, unemployment, and substance
abuse.
Early Head Start (EHS).—The agreement
includes a $115,000,000 increase for Early
Head Start Expansion and Early Head Start-
Child Care (EHS-CC) Partnership Grants.
The agreement directs ACF to continue to
equally prioritize EHS Expansion and EHS–
CC Partnerships, as determined by the needs
of local communities, as done in previous
grant competitions for this program. Within
the total, the agreement includes a cost of
living adjustment of $15,000,000 for existing
grantees.
Head Start.—The agreement provides a full
cost-of-living adjustment of $216,000,000 to
Head Start grantees. The agreement also in-
cludes $260,000,000 for grantees to increase
their program hours, in alignment with the
requirement in the Head Start Program Per-
formance Standards. In addition to sup-
porting working families, research shows
that extended duration of high-quality early
learning services improves child learning
and developmental outcomes.
Family Violence Prevention and Serv-
ices.—The agreement includes a $9,000,000 in-
crease and directs ACF to use $5,000,000 of
that increase to supplement existing funding
for Native American tribes and tribal organi-
zations. The agreement recognizes the im-
portance of providing supports that are cul-
turally appropriate to the populations they
serve.
Native American Programs.—The agree-
ment includes $12,000,000 for Native Amer-
ican language preservation activities, in-
cluding $3,000,000 for Generation Indigenous,
and not less than $4,000,000 for language im-
mersion programs authorized by section
803C(b)(7)(A)–(C) of the Native American Pro-
grams Act.
Runaway and Homeless Youth.—The agree-
ment provides an increase of $8,300,000 for
the Runaway and Homeless Youth program.
The new funding should be provided to Tran-
sitional Living Program and Maternal Group
Home grantees whose awards end on April 30,
2018 to continue services until new awards
for those grantees are made or for grantees
who did not get a new grant, a continuation
grant to provide services until the end of fis-
cal year 2018. The new funding can only be
used for additional new awards after funds
have been set aside for completing exten-
sions to ensure grantees awarded grants in
fiscal year 2013 are able to operate through
the end of fiscal year 2018.
Street Outreach Program.—The agreement
acknowledges the value of geographic bal-
ance in providing resources to fight against
youth homelessness and encourages ACF to
award at least one grant in each of the 10 re-
gions.
PROMOTING SAFE AND STABLE FAMILIES
Kinship Navigator Programs.—As parents
struggle with opioid addiction and substance
use disorder, more grandparents and rel-
atives are taking primary responsibility for
the care of children. The agreement includes
$20,000,000 to assist States and Indian tribes
to develop and enhance kinship navigator
programs. The new funding is provided to
support changes to comply with upcoming
requirements in the recently passed Family
First Prevention Services Act, included as
part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018
(P.L. 115–123).
Regional Partnership Grants.—This agree-
ment includes $20,000,000 for Regional Part-
nership Grants to fund community collabo-
rations among substance abuse treatment,
courts, and child welfare agencies to improve
the lives of children and families affected by
opioids and other substance use disorders.
ADMINISTRATION FOR COMMUNITY LIVING
(ACL)
AGING AND DISABILITY SERVICES PROGRAMS
Aging Network Support Activities.—The
agreement provides $12,461,000 for Aging Net-
work Support Activities, of which $5,000,000
is for the Holocaust Survivor’s Assistance
program.
Alzheimer’s Disease Program.—The agree-
ment provides $23,500,000 for the Alzheimer’s
Disease Program, an increase of $4,000,000.
The agreement accepts the Administration’s
proposal to streamline several Alzheimer’s
disease programs into one larger, more flexi-
ble program that will allow States, commu-
nities, nonprofits, and Indian tribes greater
access to funding opportunities authorized
under Title IV of the Older Americans Act.
The agreement directs ACL to expand sup-
port for evidence-based interventions funded
in fiscal year 2017 and to test cutting edge
approaches that will serve persons with Alz-
heimer’s disease, related dementias, and
their family caregivers. The agreement notes
that the National Institute on Aging will
continue its Alzheimer’s Disease Outreach

partner with State Assistive Technology Act
Programs to develop and implement reutili-
zation programs with a goal of containing
Medicaid costs.
Elder Rights Support Activities.—The
agreement includes $15,874,000 for Elder
Rights Support Activities, of which
$12,000,000 is included for the Elder Justice
and Adult Protective Services program.
Developmental Disabilities Projects of Na-
tional Significance.—The agreement in-
cludes $12,000,000 for Developmental Disabil-
ities Projects of National Significance. Of
this amount, not less than $1,000,000 is to
fund transportation assistance activities for
older adults and persons with disabilities.
The transportation activities should focus on
the most cost-effective and sustainable
strategies that can be replicated to other
communities.
Independent Living.—The agreement pro-
vides $113,183,000 for the Independent Living
program, of which $24,878,000 is for the Inde-
pendent Living State Grants program and
$88,305,000 is for the Centers for Independent
Living program.
Paralysis Resource Center.—The agree-
ment includes $7,700,000 for the National Pa-
ralysis Resource Center (PRC), an increase of
$1,000,000. This program has long provided es-
sential, comprehensive information, and re-
ferral services that promote independence
and quality of life for the 5.4 million people
living with paralysis and their families. The
agreement directs ACL to continue support
for the national PRC at not less than the fis-
cal year 2017 funding level.
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
GENERAL DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT
Healthcare Costs of Illegal Immigration.—
The agreement directs the Department to
provide a report to the Committees on Ap-
propriations of the House of Representatives
and the Senate on available information re-
garding the costs borne by State and local
governments for providing services to indi-
viduals without legal immigration status, in-
cluding the Federal resources from the De-
partment that are being used to assist States
in fiscal year 2018 to cover these expenses.
Nonrecurring Expenses Fund.—In addition
to funds directed in the CDC’s Buildings and
Facilities account to support the BSL-4 lab-
oratory, the agreement directs the Secretary
to prioritize obligations from resources in
the Nonrecurring Expenses Fund for the fol-
lowing projects: CDC National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health facility, In-
dian Health Services facilities, NIH chillers,
Food and Drug Administration laboratory
renovations, HHS cybersecurity initiatives,
and the Departmental Appeals Board case
management system. Additionally, the
agreement notes the number of notified
projects that have not yet been completed.
The agreement encourages the Secretary to
complete outstanding projects in a timely
manner and prior to directing funding to new
projects.
Obligation Reports.—The agreement di-
rects the Secretary to submit electronically
to the Committees on Appropriations of the
House of Representatives and the Senate an
Excel table detailing the obligations made in
the most recent quarter for each office and
activity funded under this appropriation not
later than 30 days after the end of each quar-
ter.
Staffing Reports.—The agreement directs
the Secretary to submit to the Committees
on Appropriations of the House of Represent-
atives and the Senate a monthly Excel table
listing the names, titles, grades, agencies,
and divisions of all of the political ap-
pointees and special government employees,
and detailees that were employed by or as-
signed within the Department during the
previous month.
Technical Assistance.—The agreement re-
iterates the importance of the long-standing
relationship between the Committees on Ap-
propriations of the House of Representatives
and the Senate (Committees) and the De-
partment’s Office of the Assistant Secretary
for Financial Resources (ASFR). As noted in
Senate Report 115–150, the Committees have
long relied on ASFR to facilitate the Com-
mittees’ requests for legal and technical
feedback that is not covered by a legitimate
claim of privilege, as well as technical as-
sistance to ensure the Committees’ guidance
is implemented as intended. The Committees
expect that all technical assistance requests
be dealt with in a manner that is consistent
with past precedent, including timely an-
swers that respond to any specific inquiries.
OFFICE OF MEDICARE HEARINGS AND APPEALS
The agreement directs the Office of Medi-
care Hearings and Appeals to provide quar-
terly reports to the Committees on Appro-
priations of the House of Representatives
and the Senate reflecting the total number
of appeals filed, appeals pending, and appeals
disposed of for all levels of the appeals proc-
ess. The quarterly updates should include a
breakout of Recovery Audit Contractor
(RAC) and non-RAC claims.
PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES
EMERGENCY FUND
The agreement includes a program level of
$1,953,458,000 for the Public Health and Social
Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF). This
funding will support a comprehensive pro-
gram to prepare for and respond to the
health and medical consequences of all pub-
lic health emergencies, including bioter-
rorism, and support the cybersecurity efforts
of HHS.
The agreement commends the Assistant
Secretary for Preparedness and Response
(ASPR) for the work ASPR has done to de-
velop regional, coalition-based disaster med-
ical response plans. The agreement encour-
ages ASPR to work with States that have
demonstrated success in creating statewide
disaster healthcare systems to coordinate
patient movement, evacuation and field
emergency care, particularly in areas with
high incidence of natural disasters, with the
goal of establishing best practices and maxi-
mizing Federal resources.
Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP).—
The agreement rejects the Administration’s
proposal to change the allocation formula
that would leave 26 States and Territories
without HPP funding.

agreement reflects the allocation of the Pre-
vention and Public Health Fund.

TITLE III
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
EDUCATION FOR THE DISADVANTAGED
Consultation on State Plans.—As State
Educational Agencies work to finalize their
plans for distributing their section 1003
funds, and continue to give priority to sup-
porting Local Educational Agencies as re-
quired under section 1003(f) of the Every Stu-
dent Succeeds Act (ESSA), States must in-
clude assurances in their State plans as re-
quired under 1111(g)(2), including the assur-
ance that the State educational agencies
will ensure that local educational agencies,
in developing and implementing programs
under Title I, Part A, will, to the extent fea-
sible, work in consultation with outside
intermediary organizations (such as edu-
cational service agencies), or individuals,
that have practical expertise in the develop-
ment or use of evidence-based strategies and
programs to improve teaching, learning, and
schools.
SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS
Native Hawaiian Education Program.—The
agreement includes $36,397,000 for the Native
Hawaiian Education program, including
$650,000 for the Native Hawaiian Education
Council.
Student Support and Academic Enrich-
ment Grants.—One of the goals of the Stu-
dent Support and Academic Enrichment
(SSAE) grants program is to provide safe,
healthy learning environments for students.
The funding can be utilized for a wide range
of uses, including to expand access to or co-
ordinate resources for school-based mental
health services and supports, which may in-
clude trauma-informed practices and school
counseling; bullying prevention; and profes-
sional development for personnel in crisis
management and school-based violence pre-
vention strategies. The agreement provides
$1,100,000,000, which is a $700,000,000 increase
over fiscal year 2017, to make these flexible
resources available to States, which can in-
clude assisting in protecting students and
educators.
In addition to the language included in
House Report 115–244 regarding SSAE grants
and science, technology, engineering, and
math (STEM) education, the agreement en-
courages the Department to especially sup-
port pre-kindergarten through grade 12 com-
puter science education programs that ad-
dress the enrollment and achievement gap
for underrepresented students such as mi-
norities, girls, and youth from families liv-
ing at or below the poverty line.
INNOVATION AND IMPROVEMENT
Education Innovation and Research
(EIR).—The agreement reiterates and applies
language included under this heading in both
House Report 115–244 and Senate Report 115–
150 to funds provided in this Act.
In addition, within the total, the agree-
ment includes $50,000,000 for innovative
STEM education projects, including com-
puter science education. The Department
proposed in its fiscal year 2019 budget new
bill language, not included in this agree-
ment, that would allow the Secretary to de-
vote all of these funds to STEM. This pro-
posal will be considered as part of the fiscal
year 2019 appropriations process.
The Department should coordinate with
other Federal agencies that issue grants in
this area, including the National Science
Foundation, to avoid duplication and ensure
activities funded under EIR build on the ex-
isting evidence base and provide a unique
benefit to the field. The agreement also
notes that a wide-range of formula and com-
petitive grants at the Department of Edu-
cation can also be used to support STEM
education.
The agreement also encourages the Depart-
ment to seek opportunities to collaborate
with researchers from the fields of neuro-
science, cognitive development, psychiatry,
psychology, and education and human devel-
opment, for the purposes of promoting re-
search-based scientific interventions in the
science of learning that improve academic
outcomes for high-need, high-poverty stu-
dents. The agreement also directs the De-
partment to prioritize proposals that seek to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2706 March 22, 2018
improve early learning and cognitive devel-
opment outcomes among high-need, high-
poverty students through neuroscience-based
and scientifically validated interventions
and meet the evidence requirements for this
program established by ESSA.
Charter Schools Program.—The agreement
modifies the language in Senate Report 115–
150 to include up to $7,500,000 for developer
grants to establish or expand charter schools
in underserved, high-poverty, rural areas, as
described therein.
Supporting Effective Educator Develop-
ment.—In awarding grants under the Sup-
porting Effective Educator Development
(SEED) program, the Secretary is directed to
ensure that grants are distributed among a
diverse set of eligible entities including Na-
tional non-profit organizations imple-
menting evidence-based activities (as defined
in section 8101(21)(A)(i) of the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act) across a num-
ber of sites which can help bring to scale evi-
dence-based programs of National signifi-
cance across the country.
Additionally, the agreement supports fund-
ing for activities described under this head-
ing in the explanatory statement accom-
panying Division H of the Consolidated Ap-
propriations Act, 2017, regarding programs,
which may include a consortia of programs
operating in multiple States, to improve the
academic preparation and college readiness,
including the college-and-career pipeline, of
rural youth.
Finally, within the SEED program, the
agreement supports funding for innovative
programs providing professional develop-
ment for teachers in early childhood and
early elementary school focused on social
emotional learning, classroom and behavior
management, and improving school climate,
with the goal of improving the social and
emotional well-being and academic perform-
ance of students.
Arts in Education.—The agreement in-
cludes funding to continue the Department’s
support for all grant programs funded within
this program at not less than the fiscal year
2017 level. This includes $7,700,000, an in-
crease of $1,000,000, for the National Arts in
Education program, to continue the Depart-
ment’s support for National-level, high-qual-
ity arts education projects, which could in-
clude developing arts education data map-
ping tools to identify gaps in arts education
across the country; developing and updating
standards-aligned arts curriculum; profes-
sional development for special educators;
and other high-quality projects for children
and youth, with an emphasis on servicing
students from low-income families and stu-
dents with disabilities. The Department is
also directed to provide more flexibility to
Arts in Education Model Development and
Dissemination grantees by establishing more
appropriate performance measures, such as
access to standards-based arts education in
high-needs schools and assessment of student
knowledge and skills in the arts, for this
grant activity.
SAFE SCHOOLS AND CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION
National Activities.—The agreement in-
cludes $90,000,000, an increase of $22,000,000.
These funds should be used to expand evi-
dence-based programs to ensure safe learning
environments for students and educators, in-
cluding improving school climates, pre-
venting violence in schools, and providing
services in response to serious incidents.
Promise Neighborhoods.—The agreement
reiterates language under this heading in
Senate Report 115–150 except that it expects
initial implementation continuation grants
to be awarded as soon as possible, not later
than June 1, 2018. In addition, the agreement
specifies that not less than $12,000,000 shall
be available for such extension grants in fis-
cal year 2018, with a minimum grant of not
less than $3,000,000 per year.
SPECIAL EDUCATION
Within the total for Technical Assistance
and Dissemination the agreement includes
$15,083,000 for education activities authorized
under P.L.—108–406.
Seclusion and Restraint.—The agreement
includes direction for the Government Ac-
countability Office (GAO) to conduct a fur-
ther study on data reported to the Depart-
ment of Education’s Office for Civil Rights
on the use of seclusion and restraints for all
students at the school and district level on
efforts to reduce the use of seclusion and re-
straint practices. There is concern that se-
clusion and restraint issues continue to be
chronically underreported. In particular,
GAO is encouraged to evaluate recommenda-
tions for improving data collection at any
school, including any special education or al-
ternative school, that serves students, ages
3–21. In fulfilling the requested study, the
GAO should also include recommendations,
including examples of best practices, of how
schools are adopting effective alternatives to
these practices and reducing the incidence of
seclusion and restraint.
STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
Federal Work Study.—The agreement in-
cludes up to $9,625,000, an increase of
$1,235,000, for the Work Colleges program au-
thorized under section 448 of the Higher Edu-
cation Act.
Pell Grants.—The agreement includes suf-
ficient funding to increase the maximum
award by $175 to $6,095 in academic year 2018–
2019.
STUDENT AID ADMINISTRATION
Student Loan Servicing.—The agreement
supports efforts to improve the Federal stu-
dent aid application and servicing process to
best serve students and student borrowers.
However, there remains concern about spe-
cific elements of the Department’s proposal
to significantly revamp the Federal student
loan servicing process. Accordingly, the
agreement includes language, modified from
Senate Report 115–150, preventing the De-
partment from moving forward with specific
components of their proposal and current so-
licitation unless they are modified to include
certain elements to promote accountability,
transparency, and competition, to better
serve student borrowers and taxpayers.
Nothing in this language should be inter-
preted as otherwise preventing the Depart-
ment from modernizing the student loan
servicing process, or the student and bor-
rower experience; or improving the current
performance-based student loan allocation
process to strengthen incentives for servicers
to provide high-quality service to borrowers.
The Department is directed to provide pur-
suant to the quarterly obligation plans re-
porting instructions in Senate Report 115–150
the following additional information: per-
formance metrics, total loan volume, and
number of accounts broken out by servicer
and for each private collection agency. Fur-
ther, the Department is directed to provide
the requested briefing on the benefits for
servicemembers and veterans directive in
Senate Report 115–150 within 30 days of en-
actment of this Act.
HIGHER EDUCATION
Cybersecurity Education.—The growing
presence of cybersecurity threats continues
to highlight the need for quality cybersecu-
rity education programs. The efforts of the
nation’s community colleges to expand cy-
bersecurity education in lower-income stu-
dent populations is commendable and impor-
tant, but often those schools lack the re-
sources to maintain state of the art pro-
grams. To address these needs, the agree-
ment includes $1,000,000 for the Department
of Education to establish a pilot grant pro-
gram to support technological upgrades for
community colleges for the purpose of sup-
porting cybersecurity programs.
Federal TRIO Programs.—The agreement
reiterates the language in Senate Report 115–
150 regarding reviewing fiscal year 2017 appli-
cations with minor technical issues. Further,
the agreement clarifies that minor technical
issues includes applications with minor
budget issues, and adds that the review
should include applications under all fiscal
year 2017 TRIO competitions.
GEAR UP.—The Department is directed to
announce Notices Inviting Applications for
New Awards for State Grants and Partner-
ship Grants in the Federal Register. In such
notice for State grants, the Department is
directed to uphold the long-standing guid-
ance that States may only administer one
active State GEAR UP grant at a time. The
Secretary is directed to provide written
guidance in the Federal Register notifying
applicants that only States without an ac-
tive State GEAR UP grant, or States that
have an active State GEAR UP grant that is
scheduled to end prior to October 1, 2018, will
be eligible to receive a new State GEAR UP
award funded in whole or in part by this ap-
propriation.
Open Textbooks Pilot.—The agreement in-
cludes $5,000,000 for a pilot, competitive
grant program to support projects at institu-
tions of higher education that create new
open textbooks or expand their use in order
to achieve savings for students while main-
taining or improving instruction and student
learning outcomes. The Secretary shall re-
quire that any open textbook created with
program funds be licensed under a nonexclu-
sive, irrevocable license to the public to ex-
ercise any of the rights under copyright con-
ditioned only on the requirement that attri-
bution be given as directed by the copyright
owner. Further, the Secretary should give
special consideration to projects at institu-
tions of higher education that demonstrate
the greatest potential to achieve the highest
level of savings for students through sustain-
able, expanded use of open textbooks in post-
secondary courses offered by the eligible en-
tity and expand the use of open textbooks at
institutions of higher education outside of
the eligible entity.
HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE AND
UNIVERSITY CAPITAL FINANCING PROGRAM
The agreement includes new funding and
provisions related to the deferment of out-
standing loans for private historically Black
colleges and universities (HBCUs). It also in-
cludes a new provision regarding an outreach
plan to help additional public HBCUs partici-
pate in the program.
DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT
Reorganization Plans.—The Department is
directed to provide detailed information on
any plans to reform or reorganize the De-
partment to the Committees on Appropria-
tions of the House of Representatives and
Senate prior to beginning implementing any
such plans. There remains concern that ade-
quate information about and justification for
its reorganization have not been trans-
parently shared with Congress and stake-
holders to be able to evaluate the changes
being proposed, including the potential bene-
fits or existing challenges they are meant to
address.
Of particular concern is any attempt to re-
organize or alter the current structure of the
Budget Service office. The Committees on
Appropriations of the House of Representa-
tives and the Senate rely on the quality and
professional expertise of this office and are
deeply concerned about proposed changes to
its structure. Therefore, a provision is in-
cluded in the agreement which would not
allow funding to be used for the purpose of
reorganizing or decentralizing the office.
The Budget Service office shall continue to
have lead responsibility for: (1) developing
and implementing the Department’s budget;
(2) formulating budget and related legisla-
tive policies for Department programs; (3)
presenting the Department’s budget and re-
lated policy proposals to the public and Con-
gress; (4) establishing and maintaining a De-
partment-wide performance-based budget
formulation, execution, and management
system; and (5) reviewing and analyzing De-
partment program operations, including
budget and policy implementation. The
Budget Service office shall also continue to
play a prominent role in reviewing, ana-
lyzing and estimating costs of regulations,
analyzing policy, and overseeing the Depart-
ment’s management of its programs and ad-
ministrative resources. There is strong con-
cern that a decentralization of these func-
tions will create inefficiencies.
Borrower Defense Claims Reporting.—The
Department is directed to provide quarterly
reports pursuant to the borrower defense
claims reporting instructions in Senate Re-
port 115–150 that also include the following
additional information: the total and median
dollar amount of outstanding debt from bor-
rowers prior to discharge, the percentage of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2707
March 22, 2018
the total approved claims receiving partial
relief, and the median student loan debt re-
maining as part of claims receiving partial
relief.
Office for Civil Rights.—The agreement in-
cludes $117,000,000 for the Office for Civil
Rights (OCR). The OCR is directed in fiscal
year 2018 to use this appropriation to in-
crease its level of full time equivalent em-
ployment in order to effectively and timely
investigate complaints; execute and report
on the civil rights data collection; thor-
oughly monitor corrective actions of institu-
tions and meet other critical workloads.
Further, OCR is directed to maintain its 12
regional offices consistent with the organiza-
tional structure described in its fiscal year
2018 and 2019 Justification of Appropriation
Estimates to the Congress.
GENERAL PROVISIONS
The agreement includes a new general pro-
vision to exempt the Magnet Schools pro-
gram from one long-standing general provi-
sion on transporting students. ESSA reau-
thorized the Magnet School program in 2015
and allowed funds to be used for transpor-
tation and this agreement should not impede
the Magnet School program from doing so.
The agreement notes that the Committees
on Appropriations of the House of Represent-
atives and the Senate should consider a
longer term solution to this issue during the
fiscal year 2019 appropriations process.
The agreement modifies a provision re-
scinding unobligated balances available for
the Pell Grant program to offset the manda-
tory costs of increasing the maximum award.
The agreement includes a new provision to
address a drafting error related to the reau-
thorization of the Impact Aid program.
The agreement includes a new provision
clarifying availability of hurricane relief
funding.
The agreement includes a new provision to
clarify current law and allow for the contin-
ued sharing of financial data to scholarship
granting organizations.
The agreement includes a new provision
modifying existing authority relating to co-
hort default rates for a period of two years.
The agreement includes a new provision re-
lated to public service loan forgiveness.
The agreement includes a new provision re-
garding Pell eligibility for children of first
responders who have died in the line of duty.
TITLE IV—RELATED AGENCIES
CORPORATION FOR NATIONAL AND COMMUNITY
SERVICE (CNCS)
Innovation, Demonstration, and Other Ac-
tivities.—The agreement includes $7,600,000
for innovation, demonstration, and assist-
ance activities. Within the total, the agree-
ment recommends $5,400,000 for the Volun-
teer Generation Fund. The agreement also
includes a total of $2,200,000 for National
Days of Service, to be equally allocated be-
tween the September 11 National Day of
Service and Remembrance and the Martin
Luther King, Jr. National Day of Service,
two important national events.
Commission Investment Fund (CIF).—The
agreement includes not less than $8,500,000,
an increase of $1,000,000 for CIF, which pro-
vides funds to State commissions for train-
ing and technical assistance activities to ex-
pand the capacity of current and potential
AmeriCorps programs, particularly in under-
served areas.
Reduced Full Time Service Positions.—The
agreement includes a provision to allow
CNCS to establish a new 1,200 hour service
position, including a proportional reduction
in the education award.

The agreement includes $10,000,000 for the
implementation of information technology
systems modernization efforts. Within 180
days of enactment of this Act, the Railroad
Retirement Board is directed to submit a
comprehensive update to the Committees on
Appropriations of the House of Representa-
tives and the Senate on: project status,
timelines to completion, and total cost of de-
velopment.
SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION (SSA)
LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Administrative Funding.—The agreement
provides an increase of $480,000,000 for admin-
istrative expenses. Of this amount, bill lan-
guage directs $280,000,000 to support SSA’s
information technology modernization ini-
tiative and directs $100,000,000, with extended
availability, for processing the backlog of
disability hearings within the Office of Hear-
ings Operations.
Capability Determination Process Im-
provements.—The agreement notes the im-
portance of SSA accurately evaluating an in-
dividual’s ability to manage—or direct the
management of—his or her Social Security
benefits. However, a 2016 study by the Na-
tional Academies of Sciences, Engineering,
and Medicine, entitled Informing Social Se-
curity’s Process for Financial Capability De-
termination, raised concerns about SSA’s ca-
pability determination process, and a 2015 in-
ternal SSA report found that most capa-
bility determination decisions are not ade-
quately developed or documented. The agree-
ment is encouraged by the steps SSA is tak-
ing to improve its capability determination
process and requests a report not later than
60 days after the enactment of this Act on
SSA’s plans to evaluate the effects of these
changes.
Disability Case Processing System
(DCPS).—The agreement supports efforts to
modernize the case processing systems used
by State Disability Determination Service
agencies, including the DCPS. The SSA is di-
rected to take the necessary actions that
would permit States the ability to select
from all available options in the moderniza-
tion of their case processing systems, so long
as the selected option has similar or better
functionality as DCPS without imposing
costs that are higher than using DCPS. Such
process must be in conformance with all Fed-
eral procurement rules and information
technology security requirements. The
agreement requests a detailed analysis in the
fiscal year 2020 Congressional Justification
on the actions SSA has taken to implement
this request. The analysis should include a
detailed description of any challenges or
legal barriers to implementing any option to
modernize the disability case processing sys-
tem.
Field Offices.—The agreement is concerned
that SSA may be reducing resources for field
offices and expects SSA to continue to sup-
port frontline operations. In fiscal year 2017,
SSA field offices served approximately 42
million visitors, a five percent increase over
fiscal year 2015. The high volume of visitors,
combined with factors such as complex
workloads, shortened public operating hours,
and staff shortages, have led to increased
wait times in both field offices and the Na-
tional 800 number. SSA is directed to submit
a report to the Committees on Appropria-
tions of the House of Representatives and
the Senate within 90 days of enactment of
this Act outlining its plan for ensuring that
field offices, hearing offices, processing cen-
ters, and teleservice centers are receiving
sufficient resources to maintain at least the
current level of constituent services.
Field Office Closures.—There is significant
concern about decisions to close field offices
that may not be in accordance with law, reg-
ulations, and SSA procedures. These critical
decisions must comply with Federal law, reg-
ulations, and procedures to account for the
impact such actions will have on the commu-
nity. The agreement notes that SSA’s In-
spector General (IG) is reviewing decisions to
close field offices, including whether SSA
followed internal procedures in proposing
consolidation, notifying the public, and con-
sidering feedback from public input. While
the IG review is ongoing, the Acting Com-
missioner should not make any final deci-
sions related to field office locations under
review. Further, the agreement encourages
SSA to carefully consider and fully imple-
ment any IG recommendations that may re-
sult from such review.
Report on Compassionate Allowances.—
The agreement is concerned about SSA’s
process for identifying Compassionate Allow-
ance (CAL) conditions. The GAO issued a re-
port entitled SSA’s Compassionate Allow-
ance Initiative (GAO–17–625), which found
that SSA did not have a formal or system-
atic approach for designating certain med-
ical conditions for the CAL initiative. The
agreement directs SSA to submit a report
not later than 60 days after the enactment of
this Act describing the steps that SSA is
taking to identify and evaluate new CAL
conditions and to improve the overall man-
agement of the process, including the regular
review and use of available data to assess the
accuracy and consistency of CAL decision-
making.
Representative Payee Program.—The
agreement recognizes the importance of pro-
viding oversight of the individuals and orga-
nizations serving as representative payees
and that the current oversight structure
needs improvement. The agreement supports
efforts to institute a new, stronger system of
oversight through the Federal-State Protec-
tion and Advocacy system. The SSA’s cur-
rent contractor has consistently underper-
formed and is not on track to meet the terms
of the contract. In light of the concerns
about the existing vendor’s performance, the
agreement believes it would be inappropriate
for SSA to extend its current contract be-
yond its July 31, 2018 expiration date. Given
continued concern over the administration
of the program, SSA should expect further
Congressional oversight of this situation
throughout the coming year.
Ticket to Work Program.—The agreement
recognizes that the purpose of the Ticket to
Work Program is to provide the assistance
disabled beneficiaries need to return to
work. The agreement notes that a number of
evaluations have been done on the Ticket to
Work Program, including a 2016 SSA IG Re-
port entitled ‘‘The Ticket to Work Program’’
(A–02–17–50203) and independent evaluations
by Mathematica Policy Research. In lieu of
language in Senate Report 115–150, the agree-
ment directs GAO to submit a report to the
Committees on Appropriations of the House
of Representatives and the Senate, the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means of the House of
Representatives, and the Committee on Fi-
nance of the Senate, and to make such re-
port publicly available. The report shall ad-
dress the following: the annual benefit sav-
ings associated with Tickets in use, the an-
nual cost associated with the Ticket to Work
Program (in excess of those that would be
made under the SSA’s traditional cost-reim-
bursement to vocational rehabilitation agen-
cies, if the Ticket to Work program did not
exist), how these costs and savings compare
over time, and whether the Ticket to Work
Program has led to increased earnings for
beneficiaries and, if it is not possible to
make such a determination, the options for a
demonstration or study that would be nec-
essary to make such a determination on
earnings. Finally, GAO is directed to include
any benefits from the Ticket to Work Pro-
gram that are not captured by the above
cost-savings analysis, whether those benefits
are quantifiable, and to incorporate the
views of beneficiary representatives and
other stakeholders in this aspect of the re-
port.
Vocational Experts.—The agreement notes
that the Office of Hearing Operations (OHO)
is developing a solicitation for a market-

based approach to acquiring contractors to
provide vocational expert testimony. Prior
to issuing a solicitation, the agreement re-
quests a report on the market research used
to assess the fair and reasonable rate for vo-
cational experts. The report shall also in-
clude an assessment of how the market-
based approach taken by SSA will ensure vo-
cational experts contracted under the new
procurement will have the training and expe-
rience to demonstrate a thorough under-
standing of the impact of impairments on
functional abilities, labor market needs, and
job placement strategies. The report should
also include SSA’s process for measuring
contractor performance and contractor ad-
herence to requirements on vocational ex-
pert qualifications.
Work Incentives Planning and Assistance
(WIPA) and Protection and Advocacy for
Beneficiaries of Social Security (PABSS).
The agreement includes $23,000,000 for WIPA
and $7,000,000 for PABSS.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2784 March 22, 2018
DIVISION I—LEGISLATIVE BRANCH
APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018
The following is an explanation of the ef-
fects of Division I, which makes appropria-
tions for the Legislative Branch for fiscal
year 2018. Unless otherwise noted, reference
to the House and Senate reports are to House
Report 115–199 and Senate Report 115–137.
The language included in these reports
should be complied with and carry the same
emphasis as the language included in the ex-
planatory statement, unless specifically ad-
dressed to the contrary in this explanatory
statement. While repeating some report lan-
guage for emphasis, this explanatory state-
ment does not intend to negate the language
referred to above unless expressly provided
herein.
Security: This agreement provides addi-
tional resources to the United States Capitol
Police and the Sergeants at Arms of both
chambers to enhance security for Members
of Congress, their staff, and office visitors.
Over the past year there have been humbling
reminders of the threats Members of Con-
gress and their staff face as public servants.
The Congressional community has also been
reminded of the heroic capabilities of the
men and women of the United States Capitol
Police. There is no higher priority in this
agreement than providing adequate re-
sources for the physical security of Members
and their staff as well as constituents and
visitors to the Capitol campus.
Reprogramming Guidelines: It is expected
that all agencies notify the Committees on
Appropriations of the House and the Senate
of any significant departures from budget
plans presented to the Committees in any
agency’s budget justifications. In particular,
agencies funded through this bill are re-
quired to notify the Committees prior to
each reprogramming of funds in excess of the
lesser of 10 percent or $750,000 between pro-
grams, projects or activities, or in excess of
$750,000 between object classifications (ex-
cept for shifts within the pay categories, ob-
ject class 11, 12, and 13 or as further specified
in each agency’s respective section). This in-
cludes cumulative reprogrammings that to-
gether total at least $750,000 from or to a par-
ticular program, activity, or object classi-
fication as well as reprogramming FTEs or
funds to create new organizational entities
within the agency or to restructure entities
which already exist. The Committees desire
to be notified of reprogramming actions
which involve less than the above-mentioned
amounts if such actions would have the ef-
fect of changing an agency’s funding require-
ments in future years or if programs or
projects specifically cited in the Commit-
tee’s reports are affected.
Inspectors General Budgets: It is impor-
tant to ensure independence between Legis-
lative Branch Inspectors General (IG) and
their respective reporting agencies. Agencies
are directed to include a separate section in
their respective future budget justifications
reflecting a detailed budget request for the
agency’s IG Office. Additionally, each IG is
directed to keep the Committees on Appro-
priations of the House and Senate fully ap-
prised of its funding needs, and each agency
shall not interfere with, or require approval
for, such communications.
TITLE I
SENATE
The agreement includes $919,931,581 for
Senate operations. This item relates solely
to the Senate, and is in accordance with long
practice under which each body determines
its own housekeeping requirements and the
other concurs without intervention.
The requirements of the report requested
pursuant to S. Rept. 106–304 related to Sen-
ate collections is also requested to include,
for all appropriated amounts, the balance of
funds, the amount of prudent reserves, and
the status, timeline, and cost expectations of
future projects.
The Secretary of the Senate shall deter-
mine the allocations of the Offices under the
Senators’ Official Personnel and Office Ex-
pense Account for fiscal year 2018 by updat-
ing the amounts provided under Public Law
111–68 to reflect any applicable adjustments
under Public Law 92–607, Public Law 95–94,
and Public Law 90–57.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
The agreement provides for unspent
amounts remaining in Senators’ Official Per-
sonnel and Office Expense Account to be
used for deficit or debt reduction and author-
ity for transfer of funds, exempts the Senate
from the requirements of 41 U.S.C. 6101, and
provides a technical change to the Student
Loan Program.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
The agreement includes $1,200,000,766 for
House operations. This item relates solely to
the House, and is in accordance with long
practice under which each body determines
its own housekeeping requirements and the
other concurs without intervention.
Workplace Rights: This agreement pro-
vides $5,000,000 to the CAO for workplace
rights initiatives. The funds will support
mandatory training requirements for all
Members and staff included in House Resolu-
tion 630, as well as the establishment of the
Office of Employee Advocacy created in
House Resolution 724. Mandatory training is
an important first step to ensure that every
Member, staff, intern, fellow and detailee is
fully aware of the laws that apply to them
and their right to a harassment-free work-
place under the Congressional Account-
ability Act. The Office of Employee Advo-
cacy will provide House employees with im-
mediate access to a dedicated advocate who
will provide legal consultation, representa-
tion, and assistance on allegations, claims,
and complaints under the Congressional Ac-
countability Act in proceedings before the
Office of Compliance and Committee on Eth-
ics.
House Wellness Program: This agreement
provides $380,000 for the establishment of a
comprehensive House wellness program.
Internships: The Committee believes that
House internships should be available to the
broadest possible pool of candidates who
have the ability and interest to serve. The
Committee intends to seek information on
the extent to which paid internships could
expand the pool of candidates and how such
expansion might be implemented to the ben-
efit of Member and Committee offices and
their constituents.
House Child Care Center Expansion: This
agreement provides $12,000,000 for the second
phase of the House Child Care Center expan-
sion. While expanding the center which will
reduce the lengthy waitlist and create more
opportunities for families to utilize the facil-
ity, it also provides an opportunity to exam-
ine and evaluate the operations of the Cen-
ter. The CAO is encouraged to work with the
House Child Care Center Advisory Board in
evaluating current operations and with the
expectation any recommendations be imple-
mented in conjunction with the full physical
expansion of the Center.
Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission:
The Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission
established in 2008 is charged with pro-
moting, defending and advocating for inter-
national human rights. The Commission un-
dertakes public education activities, pro-
vides expert human rights advice and en-
courages Members of Congress to actively
engage in human rights matters. After con-
sidering testimony from the co-chairs of the
Commission an additional $200,000 has been
made available to the House Foreign Affairs
Committee in order to provide additional
support for the Commission’s work.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
The agreement provides for unspent
amounts remaining in Members’ Representa-
tional Allowances account to be used for def-
icit or debt reduction; prohibits the delivery
of bills and resolutions; prohibits the deliv-
ery of printed copies of the Congressional
Record; places a limitation on amount avail-
able to lease vehicles; places a limitation on
print copies of the U.S. Code; prohibits deliv-
ery of reports of disbursements, daily cal-
endars, and the Congressional Pictorial Di-
rectory; amends the House Services Revolv-
ing Fund, and repurposes unexpended funds.
JOINT ITEMS
JOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE
The agreement includes $4,203,000 for sala-
ries and expenses.
JOINT COMMITTEE ON TAXATION
The agreement includes $11,169,000 for sala-
ries and expenses.
OFFICE OF THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN
The agreement includes $3,838,000.
OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL ACCESSIBILITY
SERVICES
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The agreement includes $1,444,000 for sala-
ries and expenses.
CAPITOL POLICE
SALARIES
The agreement includes $351,700,000 for sal-
aries of the Capitol Police. The increase in-
cludes necessary half year funds to hire the
required officers to staff garage security and
additional pre-screeners; half year funding
for 48 civilians that will civilianize positions
currently staffed by sworn officers to allow
the department to better utilize the 48 sworn
officers. The total staffing level is expected
to be approximately 1,943 sworn and 420 civil-
ian staff. No more than $45,000,000 is rec-
ommended for overtime in fiscal year 2018,
which includes funds to support the staffing
of the Thomas P. O’Neill House Office Build-
ing. This provides for approximately 702,280
hours of additional duty.
Security: The agreement includes $7,500,000
to enhance Member protection, including
funds for increased training, equipment and
technology-related support items. The men
and women of the Capitol Police have an in-
creasingly difficult mission of protecting
Members of Congress and the overall Capitol
complex. Their mission can, at times, put
them in harm’s way. Ensuring these officers
have the best tools and resources to carry
out their duties is of the upmost importance
to Congress.
Use of Grounds: Congress understands the
need to maintain safety and order on the
Capitol grounds and the Capitol Police is
commended for their efforts. Given the fam-
ily-style neighborhood that the Capitol
shares with the surrounding community the
Committee continues to instruct the Capitol
Police to forebear enforcement of 2 U.S.C.
1963 (‘‘an act to protect the public property,
turf, and grass of the Capitol Grounds from
injury’’) and the Traffic Regulations for the
United States Capitol Grounds when encoun-
tering snow sledders on the grounds.
USCP Office of Inspector General: The
agreement includes funds to support not less
than six FTEs within the USCP Office of In-
spector General.
GENERAL EXPENSES
The agreement includes $74,800,000 for gen-
eral expenses of the Capitol Police.
OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The agreement includes $4,959,000 for sala-
ries and expenses. An increase of $1,000,000 is

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2785
March 22, 2018
provided for training and information tech-
nology enhancements.
Reform: Ensuring and protecting work-
place rights of employees is imperative and
the funds provided in this act support that
effort. Processes to protect workplace rights
have been in place for many years but they
are not perfect. As Congress considers
changes to the Congressional Accountability
Act of 1995, which will impact the Office of
Compliance’s operations, there is a need to
strengthen the agency’s overall capacity, in-
cluding the quality of its training and infor-
mation technology processes.
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The agreement includes $49,945,000 for sala-
ries and expenses.
Transparency: The Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) provides timely, nonpartisan
budgetary and economic analysis to support
the work of the Congress and its reports and
analysis can have far reaching policy impli-
cations. The Congress expects CBO to ensure
a high level of transparency, while also rec-
ognizing the importance of maintaining the
agency’s professional independence and re-
specting its analytical processes. There is
support for the work that CBO has done in
the area of transparency thus far as well as
support for the agency’s goals to continue to
clearly present and explain the methodology
and results of CBO’s analysis while pursuing
opportunities to further enhance trans-
parency. This includes exploring ways to
make more supporting documents publicly
available for methods used in analysis, cost
estimates, and forecasts.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISION
This agreement provides contract parity
with the Executive Branch.
ARCHITECT OF THE CAPITOL
The agreement includes $712,105,000 for the
activities of the Architect of the Capitol
(AOC).
Office of Inspector General: The AOC IG
must maintain a staffing level commensu-
rate with the scale of AOC’s vast portfolio of
operations, construction, and contract over-
sight. Within funds provided, the AOC IG is
directed to employ not fewer than 14 full-
time equivalent positions during fiscal year
2018. The AOC is directed to ensure that suf-
ficient funding is available for contracts and
other expenses identified by the AOC IG to
fulfill its mission.
Custodial Services: The AOC is directed to
study the feasibility of consolidating custo-
dial services for all AOC jurisdictions across
the Capitol Campus and geographically sepa-
rated facilities to include leased buildings.
The elements of this study should include
opportunities and cost savings derived from
a shared contract approach within the exist-
ing AOC custodial service(s) approaches
using in-house operations and/or contractors.
The consolidation of future custodial serv-
ices with the current maintenance and repair
services provided by the AOC should support
the desired outcome of sustaining and pre-
serving the historic fabric as well as the
building materials and architectural
accouterments through industry standard
cleaning practices that will also reduce the
life cycle costs for maintenance and repair
for the AOC. The results of this study should
be delivered to the Committees on Appro-
priations of the House and Senate within 180
days of enactment.

Thomas Jefferson Building Experience:
The recently revealed Visitor Experience
Plan for the Library of Congress’ Thomas
Jefferson Building is an initiative that has
support in Congress. The proposed concept
will enhance the Library’s ability to bring
the nation’s collections and history out of
the vaults and into public spaces. With en-
hancements to exhibition spaces and devel-
opment of learning centers, the Library can
maximize the experience for its nearly two
million annual visitors. The proposed fund-
ing for this initiative involves a public/pri-
vate partnership, which has been a successful
strategy for many similar institutions’ ef-
forts to showcase our nation’s treasures.
This agreement includes a total of
$10,000,000, for enhancements to the public
exhibits and visitor services at the Library.
Of that amount, $2,000,000 is immediately
available until September 30, 2020 to begin
planning, including developing a detailed
budget justification. The budget justifica-
tion shall provide the following: 1) An over-
all acquisition plan with project timelines; 2)
Direct and indirect cost estimates developed
in conjunction with the Architect of the Cap-
itol; 3) Projected financial impact of this
capital project on the Library’s operating
budget; 4) Total cost estimates for: design
services; construction; construction manage-
ment services; project management services;
and a contingency allowance. The plan
should also ensure consideration of historic
preservation. The remaining $8,000,000 will
become available only upon written approval
by the Chair and Ranking Member of the
Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch of
the Committee on Appropriations of the
House of Representatives and by the Chair
and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee
on the Legislative Branch of the Committee
on Appropriations of the Senate, following
review of the project’s budget justification
and cost estimate. It is expected that the Li-
brary provide to the Committees on Appro-
priations of the House and Senate a budget
justification that is comprehensive in nature
and includes elements consistent with other
project justifications in the past, prior to
consideration of future funding requests for
this project.
Memoranda of Understanding (MOU): The
Library of Congress maintains several agree-
ments with other Legislative Branch agen-
cies to provide a range of support services. It
is important that the Library works to en-
sure that the service level agreements within
the MOUs are fully met.
Preservation: The agreement defers to the
Senate report language.
National Film and Sound Recording Pres-
ervation Programs: The agreement incor-
porates language in Senate Report 115–137 re-
lated to the Library’s National Film and
Sound Recording Preservation Programs,
and it is expected that the Library will pro-
vide full support to these programs.
COPYRIGHT OFFICE
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The agreement includes $28,446,000 in direct
appropriations to the Copyright Office which
fully funds the agency’s amended request. An
additional $41,305,000 is made available from
receipts for salaries and expenses and
$2,260,000 is available from prior year unobli-
gated balances.
Modernization: Modernizing the Copyright
Office and bringing its processes into the 21st
Century has wide-spread support within Con-
gress, and this act provides funds to further
that effort. To date, the collaboration be-
tween the Copyright Office and the Library’s
Office of Chief Information Officer on mod-
ernization efforts has been promising. That
collaboration is expected to continue, while
allowing for mission-specific modernization
requirements to be defined by the Copyright
Office. As with many information technology
(IT) projects there are many phases, some
forward facing, some not. Much of the IT
modernization work to date has been behind
the scenes building a strong foundation for
the long-term IT modernization strategy.
However, there is an expectation that exter-
nal Copyright users will begin to see and
benefit from the progress being made. As
new modernized processes are rolled out it is
important to solicit feedback from the exter-
nal Copyright community and to consider
that feedback with efforts moving forward.
CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The agreement includes $119,279,000 for sal-
aries and expenses.
Public Access to CRS Reports: The bill in-
cludes a provision directing the Library of
Congress’s Congressional Research Service
(CRS) to make available to the public all
non-confidential CRS products on a website
operated and maintained by the Library of
Congress. Non-confidential CRS products in-
clude any written CRS products containing
research or analysis that are currently avail-
able for general congressional access on the
CRS Congressional Intranet, or that would
be made available on the CRS Congressional
Intranet in the normal course of business.
Non-confidential CRS reports do not include
material prepared in response to Congres-
sional requests for confidential analysis or
research. The published products are to be
made available in a standard format, such as
PDF.
CRS reports are funded by taxpayers and
should be made available to citizens, schools
and libraries across the country. Ensuring
these products are made publicly available is
in keeping with the Committees’ priority of
full transparency to the American people;
however, CRS is not expected or directed to
respond to requests from the public, and its
core mission will continue to be to provide
support to the Congress. Within 60 days of
enactment of this act CRS, in consultation
with the Library of Congress, shall provide
to the relevant oversight Committees, in-
cluding the House and Senate Appropriations
Committees, a plan for making these reports
available by the end of Fiscal Year 2018, as
well as any associated cost estimates.
Congressional Research Service Moderniza-
tion: Included in the agreement is $4,000,000
to begin modernization of CRS’s mission-spe-
cific information systems to increase effi-
ciency of the office while protecting con-
fidentiality of congressional data.
Supporting Areas of High Congressional
Demand: The agreement includes $753,000 for
eight additional support staff to handle rou-
tine requests, allowing senior staff to focus
on more highly analytical research.
BOOKS FOR THE BLIND AND PHYSICALLY
HANDICAPPED
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The agreement includes $51,498,000 for sala-
ries and expenses.
National Library Service: The National Li-
brary Service for the Blind and Physically
Handicapped (NLS) has been headquartered
for over 50 years in a privately leased build-
ing in Northwest, Washington, D.C. which is
in need of substantial renovations to meet
program requirements. Library of Congress
and NLS leadership have expressed a desire
to move the headquarters closer to the Li-
brary’s main campus. NLS believes being in
closer proximity to the Library will improve
management efficiencies by integrating into
existing Library infrastructure, reduce sup-
port service costs, reduce lease costs, and en-
hance various program synergies. Available
office space exists at the Government Pub-
lishing Office (GPO) to meet NLS’s needs.
NLS, GPO, and the Architect of the Capitol
are directed to study the feasibility of this
move and provide cost estimates to their
committees of oversight.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
The agreement includes provisions regard-
ing reimbursable and revolving funds, up-
dates to revolving fund returns to allow the
Library of Congress to accept fees for serv-
ices currently provided, allowing the Library
of Congress to accept gifts of goods and serv-
ices, providing coverage for Library of Con-
gress employees under the Congressional Ac-
countability Act, and providing equal access
to non-confidential Congressional Research
Service products.
GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE
CONGRESSIONAL PUBLISHING
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The agreement includes $79,528,000 for au-
thorized publishing, printing and binding for
the Congress.
PUBLIC INFORMATION PROGRAMS OF THE
SUPERINTENDENT OF DOCUMENTS
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The agreement includes $29,000,000.
GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE
BUSINESS OPERATIONS REVOLVING FUND

GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The agreement includes $578,916,653 in di-
rect appropriations for salaries and expenses
of the Government Accountability Office
(GAO). In addition, $23,800,000 is available
from offsetting collections. The agreement
provides $6,000,000 for information tech-
nology projects and $4,000,000 for facility
management and services projects. The
agreement also provides for statutory au-
thority related to property management.
Inspector General Reports: With the cre-
ation of Oversight.gov, which compiles non-
confidential Inspector General (IG) reports
from agencies across the Federal Govern-
ment, the agreement no longer requires the
report requested in Senate Report 115–137
and House Report 115–199 for GAO to examine
the availability of such reports by individual
IG offices.
OPEN WORLD LEADERSHIP CENTER TRUST FUND
The agreement includes $5,600,000.
JOHN C. STENNIS CENTER FOR PUBLIC SERVICE
TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
The agreement includes $430,000.
TITLE II—GENERAL PROVISIONS
The agreement continues provisions re-
lated to maintenance and care of private ve-
hicles; fiscal year limitations; rates of com-
pensation and designation; consulting serv-
ices; costs of the LBFMC; limitation on
transfers; and guided tours of the Capitol.

DIVISION J—MILITARY CONSTRUCTION,
VETERANS AFFAIRS, AND RELATED
AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018
The following is an explanation of the ef-
fects of Division J, which makes appropria-
tions for Military Construction, Veterans Af-
fairs, and Related Agencies for fiscal year
2018. Unless otherwise noted, reference to the
House and Senate reports are to House Re-
port 115–188 and Senate Report 115–130. The
language set forth in House Report 115–188
and Senate Report 115–130 should be com-
plied with and carry the same emphasis as
the language included in the joint explana-
tory statement, unless specifically addressed
to the contrary in this joint explanatory
statement. While repeating some report lan-
guage for emphasis, this joint explanatory
statement does not intend to negate the lan-
guage referred to above unless expressly pro-
vided herein. In cases in which the House or
the Senate has directed the submission of a
report, such report is to be submitted to both
Houses of Congress. House or Senate report-
ing requirements with deadlines prior to, or
within 15 days after enactment of this Act
shall be submitted no later than 60 days
after enactment of this Act. All other report-
ing deadlines not specifically directed by
this joint explanatory statement are to be
met.
TITLE I
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
Bid Savings.—Cost variation notices re-
quired by 10 U.S.C. 2853 continue to dem-
onstrate the Department of Defense con-
tinues to have bid savings on previously ap-
propriated military construction projects.
Therefore, the agreement includes rescis-
sions to the NATO Security Investment Pro-
gram and Army Family Housing Construc-
tion accounts. The Secretary of Defense is
directed to continue to submit 1002 reports
on military construction bid savings at the
end of each fiscal quarter to the Committees.
Naval Shipyard Modernization.—On Feb-
ruary 12, 2018 the Secretary of the Navy
transmitted a Shipyard Infrastructure Opti-
mization Plan as directed by Senate Report
115–130 accompanying the fiscal year 2018
Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and
Related Agencies Appropriations Act. The
report seeks to, among other requirements,
assess existing facilities for efficiencies and
address future infrastructure requirements
at public shipyards and includes a master
plan for each shipyard, including, but not
limited to, capital equipment and facility in-
vestment requirements. These first steps
taken by the Department of the Navy to
identify gaps are important and the Sec-
retary of the Navy is urged to adequately
prioritize public shipyard infrastructure, in
particular dry dock and shore infrastructure
needs to support critical maintenance of sur-
face and submarine fleets.
Coastal Erosion and Sea-Level Rise.—Sea
level rise and flooding on facilities, particu-
larly at DOD’s coastal military installations,
both in the United States and overseas con-
tinue to have harmful impacts. In a report to
Congress in January 2018 regarding the secu-
rity implications of climate-related risks,
the Department noted it had conducted a
preliminary screening-level assessment to
determine installation vulnerabilities to cli-
mate-related security risks with the goal of
identifying serious vulnerabilities and devel-
oping necessary adaptation strategies. The
report identified numerous installations that
experienced climate-related effects affecting,
among others, airfield operations, transpor-
tation, and energy infrastructure, as well as
training facilities. However, the Department
has not developed a comprehensive adapta-
tion approach, nor has it provided estimated
costs associated with implementing such a
strategy. Therefore, the Comptroller General
is directed to undertake a study of DOD’s
progress in developing a means to account
for potentially damaging weather in project
design, and to report to the Committees on
Appropriations of both Houses of Congress
no later than 180 days after enactment of
this Act. At a minimum, the Comptroller
General should answer the following ques-
tions: (1) What is known about the historical
and projected costs for facilities mainte-
nance and repair beyond expected repair
costs of DOD infrastructure stemming from
damage or degradation caused by sea level
rise and weather effects associated with cli-
mate change; (2) What best practices has
DOD adopted for incorporating climate
change adaptation into the design of mili-
tary construction or facilities sustainment,
restoration, or modernization projects; and
(3) To what extent has DOD developed a sys-
tematic process for ensuring climate change
or severe weather effects are accounted for
in the design of military construction and fa-
cilities sustainment, modernization, or res-
toration projects.
MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, ARMY
The agreement provides $923,994,000 for
Military Construction, Army. Within this
amount, the agreement provides $101,470,000
for study, planning, design, architect and en-
gineer services, and host nation support. The
agreement also provides an additional
$10,000,000 to supplement unspecified minor
military construction.
Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant.—The
U.S. Army is currently managing the envi-
ronmental remediation of the Sunflower
Army Ammunition Plant (SFAAP) property
in excess of 9,000 acres in DeSoto, Kansas,
which was conveyed to Sunflower Redevelop-
ment, LLC (SRL) through the Army and the
General Services Administration on August
3, 2005. Ten years after the conveyance, on
October 29, 2015, the Army reinforced its re-
sponsibility in writing, ‘‘the Army is com-
mitted to programming the necessary re-
sources to carry out a long-term clean-up
and has, for execution in fiscal year 2016,
awarded several services contracts for the
short-term requirements.’’ The Army further
wrote it would ‘‘issue competitively sourced
clean-up contracts, with Army oversight to
ensure its Comprehensive Environmental Re-
sponse, Compensation, and Liabilities Act
(CERCLA) § 120(h) obligation at Sunflower.’’
The Army confirmed its intention ‘‘to con-
duct in-depth coordination with Sunflower
Redevelopment, LLC (SRL) to ensure SRL’s
redevelopment priorities are synchronized
with the Army managed clean-up activities.’’
However, the Army has neglected to commu-
nicate regularly with SRL and far less than
the in-depth coordination commitment made
by the Army. The Army is conducting ongo-
ing risk assessments of contaminated por-
tions of SFAAP and is directed to work in
consultation and coordination with SRL to
ensure transparency. The findings and rec-
ommendations of such assessments should
receive approval from State and Federal reg-
ulators regarding allowable levels of con-
taminants including, but not limited to, pes-
ticides, asbestos or other contaminants sub-
ject to remediation for commercial use of
the property. The Secretary of the Army is
directed to deliver the assessment and brief
the Committees on Appropriations of both
Houses of Congress on its findings and to
provide a plan that ensures SRL’s redevelop-
ment priorities are synchronized with Army
managed cleanup activities.
Badger Army Ammunition Plant.—In 2011,
an Army Feasibility Study concluded that
an offsite drinking water treatment system
was needed as part of a comprehensive
groundwater cleanup remedy for the former
Badger Army Ammunition Plant (BAAP).
Accordingly, in 2015, the Town of Merrimac,
Wisconsin, designed and approved a sanita-
tion district required by the Army to sup-
port such a system, and as recently as May
2016, the Army noted in writing that ‘‘design
of the municipal drinking water system has
been initiated.’’ Recently, however, the
Army reversed its plans to construct and op-
erate the drinking water system. This deci-
sion, its potential to delay the provision of
clean drinking water to homes near the site,
and the Army’s lack of public communica-
tion regarding the decision is concerning.
Therefore, the Army is directed to conduct
required human health risk assessments ex-
peditiously, and if needed, use expedited con-
tracting authorities. Additionally, the Army
should hold regular public meetings to up-
date and engage with local stakeholders and
integrate local priorities in its remediation
plans. Furthermore, within 90 days of enact-
ment of this Act, the Secretary of the Army
shall submit to the Committees on Appro-
priations of both Houses of Congress a report
and provide a corresponding briefing regard-
ing the Army’s rationale and process for ap-
proving plans to construct and operate a
drinking water system and its subsequent
decision to terminate such plans, as well as
the Army’s completed and planned actions
for environmental restoration at the site.
Conveyance of property.—The Army is pro-
posing to convey 17.1 acres of land known as
Shenandoah Square and the 126 existing
housing units to raise capital to improve
other military housing owned by private en-
tities. Under the proposed action, the exist-
ing 126 housing units would be demolished to
allow for the construction of high-density
residential housing. The residents have ex-
pressed concern about the displacement from
Shenandoah Square as it is in one of the
most expensive housing markets in the coun-
try and the uncertainty about the afford-
ability of new potential housing on the site.
Therefore, the Department of the Army is
urged to explore all possible alternatives to
a conveyance of Shenandoah Square, includ-
ing a sublease of the property to an entity
that can better develop affordable housing
on the property.
MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, NAVY AND MARINE
CORPS
The agreement provides $1,553,275,000 for
Military Construction, Navy and Marine
Corps. Within this amount, the agreement
provides $219,069,000 for study, planning, de-
sign, architect and engineer services. The
agreement also provides an additional
$10,000,000 to supplement unspecified minor
military construction.
Marine Corps fire stations.—The Marine
Corps has been neglecting fire station new
construction and renovation over the years
and funding for military construction of new
stations has been deferred to the out years of
budget submissions. Many of the fire sta-
tions are deteriorating and antiquated, cre-
ating significant life, safety, and health con-
cerns. Therefore, the Secretary of the Navy
is directed to prioritize funding for fire sta-
tions in a much timelier manner and submit
to the congressional defense committees a
list of how those requirements will be incor-
porated into their construction requests for
the out years. Fire stations are valuable as-
sets that should be maintained in a manner
that will ensure appropriate response time
and their vital role in protecting U.S. na-
tional security assets on military installa-
tions.
MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, AIR FORCE
The agreement provides $1,543,558,000 for
Military Construction, Air Force. Within
this amount, the agreement provides
$97,852,000 for study, planning, design, archi-
tect and engineer services. The agreement

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2801
March 22, 2018
also provides an additional $10,000,000 to sup-
plement unspecified minor military con-
struction.
MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, DEFENSE-WIDE
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The agreement provides $2,811,513,000 for
Military Construction, Defense-Wide. Within
this amount, the agreement provides
$210,717,000 for study, planning, design, archi-
tect and engineer services, an increase of
$35,000,000. The agreement also provides an
additional $10,000,000 to supplement unspec-
ified minor military construction.
Army Corps of Engineers projects within
the Defense Health Agency.—The Army
Corps of Engineers (the Corps) has an ex-
tremely large portfolio including executing
Defense Health Agency (DHA) construction
projects. There is great concern for cost
overruns and poor execution of Corps
projects. The Corps currently has 45 active
DHA construction projects underway world-
wide where there is a definitive need for ef-
fective and efficient project management.
Therefore, the Acting Director of the Facili-
ties Division within DHA is directed to pro-
vide quarterly reports to the congressional
defense committees on the progress of all
hospital construction projects to include any
settlements that have been reached for con-
tractor error or project management defi-
ciencies.
MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, ARMY NATIONAL
GUARD
The agreement provides $220,652,000 for
Military Construction, Army National
Guard. Within this amount, the agreement
provides $16,271,000 for study, planning, de-

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BASE CLOSURE
ACCOUNT
The agreement provides $310,000,000 for the
Department of Defense Base Closure Ac-
count, an increase of $54,133,000 above the re-
quest. The additional funding is for the De-
partment to accelerate environmental reme-
diation at installations closed under pre-
vious Base Realignment and Closure rounds.
Accelerated cleanup.—The agreement in-
cludes additional funding to accelerate envi-
ronmental remediation at installations
closed during previous Base Realignment and
Closure (BRAC) rounds. Priority should be
given to those sites with newly identified ra-
diological cleanup cost. There are many fac-
tors hindering the cleanup of BRAC sites.
However, strategic investments can lead to
quicker clean-ups and faster turnover of
DOD property to the local community.
Therefore, the Department is directed to
submit to the congressional defense commit-
tees a spend plan for the additional BRAC
funds not later than 30 days after enactment
of this Act.
Perfluorinated chemicals.—Perfluorinated
chemical (PFC) contaminants linked to a
firefighting agent formerly used by the DOD
have been identified in water systems near
military installations closed during previous
Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)
rounds. Identification, testing, response, and
prevention activities are ongoing and will re-
quire significant attention in future budget
requests. Therefore, the Secretary of the Air
Force is urged to prioritize PFC-contami-
nated sites when considering BRAC cleanup
project funding requested through this ac-
count and to move forwards with short- and
long-term remediation efforts as expedi-
tiously as possible.

tation Loans Program Account, plus $395,000
to be paid to the appropriation for General
Operating Expenses, Veterans Benefits Ad-
ministration. The agreement provides for a
direct loan limitation of $2,356,000.
As indicated in the House report, the Sec-
retary is directed to provide the Committees
on Appropriations of both Houses of Con-
gress (‘‘the Committees’’’) options to support
greater utilization of the Home Loan Pro-
gram in locations with a large veteran popu-
lation and competitive housing markets.
NATIVE AMERICAN VETERAN HOUSING LOAN
PROGRAM ACCOUNT
The agreement provides $1,163,000 for ad-
ministrative expenses of the Native Amer-
ican Veteran Housing Loan Program Ac-
count.
GENERAL OPERATING EXPENSES, VETERANS
BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION
The agreement provides $2,910,000,000 for
General Operating Expenses, Veterans Bene-
fits Administration and makes available not
to exceed 10 percent of this funding until the
end of fiscal year 2019. The agreement pro-
vides $66,000,000 above the request and in-
tends that the increase be used for the Vet-
erans Claims Intake Program; additional
claims and appellate staff; increased staff for
the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employ-
ment program; and overtime payments, as
necessary.
Equitable relief.—As described in the
House report, the Secretary is directed to
continue to grant or extend equitable relief
to eligible veterans initially deemed eligible
in instances of administrative error.
Compensation claims for Camp Lejeune
contaminated water veterans.—There is con-
cern regarding the lack of consistency in the
Department’s handling of disability com-
pensation claims for veterans, former reserv-
ists, and former National Guard members
who served at Marine Corps Base Camp
Lejeune for no less than 30 days (consecutive
or nonconsecutive) between August 1, 1953
and December 31, 1987. VA established a pre-
sumption of service connection for eight dis-
eases associated with exposure to contami-
nants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune
during that period. The Department made
the decision to subject nonpresumptive
Camp Lejeune Contaminated Water (CLCW)
exposure claims to a higher level of scrutiny
than is applied to other exposure claims and
did so without providing notice or an oppor-
tunity for public comment. In addition, no
other toxic exposure claims require a posi-
tive medical opinion to warrant service con-
nection. The evidentiary burden VA requires
for CLCW nonpresumptive exposure claims is
significantly greater than the standard used
for Agent Orange or any other exposure
claims. Furthermore, there currently exists
a wealth of ‘‘competent medical evidence’’
specific to diseases related to exposure to
contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, as
published by the Agency for Toxic Sub-
stances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), the
Institute of Medicine (IoM), and other gov-
ernment-sanctioned medical experts. Never-
theless, the Department’s same Clinical Sub-
ject Matter Experts (SMEs), who provide
medical opinions, have routinely rejected
ATSDR and IoM’s findings without providing
any justification or explanation for doing so.
The Department is directed to conduct a
Special Focus Review for the CLCW claims
process and submit the results of the review
to the Committees no later than 180 days
after enactment of this Act. The report
should also address the lack of consistency
for CLCW claims as compared to other non-
presumptive and exposure claims, as well as
answer the following questions: (1) Why did
the Department determine it was necessary
to ‘‘create a process that fell outside of the
traditional Compensation and Pension (C&P)
examination process’’’ for Camp Lejeune ex-
posure claims? (2) The Department has stat-
ed that ‘‘SMEs are required to be familiar
with the study of Environmental & Occupa-
tional Medicine and Toxicology due to the
specialized nature of these claims.’’ (a) Ex-
plain what the Department means by ‘‘the
specialized nature of these claims.’’ (b) Ex-
plain how and why this process differs from
the C&P examination process for Agent Or-
ange or other exposure claims. (c) What are
the educational, practical, or other require-
ments that a VHA employee must meet in
order to qualify as a ‘‘Subject Matter Ex-
pert’’ who can adjudicate Camp Lejeune Con-
taminated Water claims? (3) What justifica-
tion did the Department use to require a
positive medical opinion to warrant service
connection for every single non-presumptive
claim for CLCW veterans? (a) What evidence
is there to demonstrate the necessity of es-
tablishing such a process? (b) What evidence
is there to demonstrate the impact that such
extraordinary evidentiary requirements have
had on the processing of CLCW exposure
claims? (4) What percentage of non-presump-
tive claims (VA wide) are currently referred
to VHA Clinical SMEs for a medical opinion?
(5) Why does the Department require an evi-
dentiary standard greater than ‘‘competent
medical evidence’’ for CLCW claims? (6) Does
the Department consider the ATSDR and
IoM reports on diseases associated with ex-
posure to contaminated water at Camp
Lejeune to be ‘‘competent medical evi-
dence?’’ (a) If so, why has the Department re-
fused to accept these findings as sufficient
medical evidence to establish a nexus of
service connection? (b) If not, why does the
Department apply a different definition of
‘‘competent medical evidence’’ to CLCW
claims than it applies to Agent Orange
claims? (7) Is there any other type of claim
for which the Department requires a positive
medical opinion from a VHA clinical Subject
Matter Expert on each claim?
VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION
OVERVIEW
As described in the Senate report, the Sec-
retary is directed to establish relationships
with personnel divisions at the Departments
of Defense (DOD) and Homeland Security to
enable rapid hiring by the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) of separating service
members.
MEDICAL SERVICES
The agreement provides $49,161,165,000 in
advance for fiscal year 2019 for Medical Serv-
ices and makes $1,400,000,000 of the advance
available through fiscal year 2020. The agree-
ment also provides $1,962,984,000 for fiscal
year 2018 in addition to the advance appro-
priation provided last year.
Given that there may be significant un-
funded liabilities created by the winding
down of the Choice Act, the agreement con-
tinues to include bill language in section 229
permitting the transfer of funding from mul-
tiple VA appropriations accounts to Medical
Services to address unfunded needs.
The agreement includes bill language re-
quiring the Secretary to ensure that suffi-
cient amounts are available for the acquisi-
tion of prosthetics designed specifically for
female veterans.
Allocations.—At the beginning of fiscal
year 2018, without public notice, the Depart-
ment considered fundamentally changing the
manner in which Medical Services alloca-
tions were made to the Veterans Integrated
Service Networks (VISNs). Specifically, con-
sideration was being given to converting al-
most $1,000,000,000 of Specific Purpose fund-
ing to General Purpose funding. After con-
sultation with Congress regarding the un-
known and potentially serious impacts the
conversion could have to programs, such as
the successful Housing and Urban Develop-
ment-Veterans Affairs Supportive Services
program, the Department ceased implemen-
tation and determined that conversion to
General Purpose funding would not go for-
ward in fiscal year 2018. In order to provide
for transparency and ensure Congressional
oversight and deliberation, in the future, the
VA is directed to consult with the Commit-
tees on Appropriations and the Committees
on Veterans Affairs of both Houses of Con-
gress before any attempt is made to change
the manner in which funding allocations are
made to the field, and to propose these types
of changes in an annual budget submission.
Opioid abuse.—The agreement provides the
estimated $329,953,000 VA will spend on inpa-
tient and outpatient treatment, methadone
and other pharmacy-related costs related to
opioid abuse; $55,821,000 to continue to imple-
ment opioid safety initiatives outlined as
part of the Comprehensive Addiction and Re-
covery Act; and $48,778,000 for the Justice
Outreach and Prevention program. In addi-
tion to these amounts, the agreement also
includes $270,000,000 for the Office of Rural
Health’s Rural Health Initiative, which
funds several pilot projects aimed at treat-
ing and preventing opioid abuse, including
projects focused on alternatives to opioid-
centered pain management in rural, highly
rural, and remote areas. In addition to the
funding levels described above, all directives
regarding opioid prevention, treatment, safe-
ty, and drug monitoring programs in both
Senate Report 115–130 and House Report 115–
188 shall be complied with.
Overmedication.—As indicated in the Sen-
ate report, and in addition to the funding
levels highlighted for opioid abuse above, the
agreement provides $500,000 for the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine to conduct an assessment of the po-
tential overmedication of veterans during
fiscal years 2010 to 2017 that led to suicides,
deaths, mental disorders, and combat-related
traumas.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2817
March 22, 2018
Mental health.—The agreement provides
the full budget request for all VA mental
health services and programs of $8,385,202,000,
with an additional $10,000,000 provided for
the Veterans Crisis Line, an additional
$22,002,000 above the request provided for the
National Centers for Posttraumatic Stress
Disorder, and an additional $10,000,000 to the
Clay Hunt pilot programs. The agreement in-
cludes $40,000,000 for the National Centers
and $99,044,000 for the Veterans Crisis Line.
The additional Clay Hunt funding will pro-
vide new funding to each pilot site to incor-
porate best practices and funding for new
pilot sites in highly rural areas. Overall, the
agreement includes $186,128,000 for suicide
prevention outreach.
Staffing shortages.—As indicated in the
Senate report, VA is directed to ensure that
the brain bank and the consultation program
for providers, particularly in rural areas,
have the appropriate number of full-time
staff.
Suicide hotline.—The agreement includes
bill language in section 232 that was con-
tained in the House bill which requires cer-
tain professional standards for the suicide
hotline. As indicated in the House report,
the Secretary is urged to develop a basic
training protocol for all VA employees who
deal with veterans in crisis, not only those
who staff the suicide hotline, as well as com-
munity providers who deal with veterans.
Women’s health.—While VA has made ef-
forts to address the needs of female veterans,
many still often report feeling unrecognized
and underappreciated. To better assist fe-
male veterans and increase their knowledge
of the services and benefits to which they are
entitled, the agreement provides $512,000,000
for gender-specific healthcare, which is
$20,000,000 above the fiscal year 2018 budget
estimate. Furthermore, the Secretary should
make it a top priority to increase female
veterans’ access and utilization of VA bene-
fits and services. There are several areas
where VA could improve the quality of life
for female veterans. One area that needs im-
provement is access to mental healthcare
services. Many female veterans are faced
with disabling mental health issues when
they leave active duty. Therefore, VA is di-
rected to renew its focus on improving access
to mental health services for female vet-
erans and to work to ensure that female vet-
erans’ psychological needs are met. In addi-
tion to mental healthcare access, VA must
ensure that VA facilities can meet the needs
of female veterans. Currently, women make
up 15 percent of the active military and are
a growing segment of the veteran popu-
lation. According to the 1990 Census, there
were 1.2 million women veterans. By the
next census in 2000, that number increased to
1.6 million, with 1.74 million at the end of
the fiscal year 2010, and it is projected to in-
crease to 1.9 million in 2020. However, even
with this growth in the female veteran popu-
lation, numerous VA facilities are still pri-
marily designed to meet the needs of male
veterans. Consequently, the agreement di-
rects VA to describe the locations where VA
facilities do not meet the standards estab-
lished in 2010 specifically for healthcare serv-
ices for female veterans. Also, VA is further
directed to create a master plan to address
issues at the locations that do not meet the
established standards for female veterans.
This report shall be submitted no later than
180 days after enactment of this Act.
Rural healthcare.—The agreement provides
$270,000,000 for the Office of Rural Health
(ORH) and the Rural Health Initiative, which
is $20,000,000 above the President’s request.
As included in the Senate report, the Depart-
ment is directed to conduct an agency-wide
assessment of its rural and highly rural
workforce to identify geographic areas where
staffing needs exist. The Committees support
the Department’s expansive use of telehealth
for medical services and encourage VA to
strive to be even more innovative, more ex-
pansive, and more connected in this area, es-
pecially as the technique has proven particu-
larly helpful in mental health and primary
care health delivery. The agreement includes
$1,348,883,000 for telehealth services, which is
$5,000,000 above the budget request. The addi-
tional funding should be used to further ex-
pand telehealth capacity and services in
rural and remote areas. The agreement di-
rects no less than $4,000,000 toward a pilot
program to train veterans in agricultural vo-
cations while also tending to behavioral and
mental health needs with behavioral
healthcare services and treatments from li-
censed providers at no fewer than three loca-
tions, as instructed in the Senate report.
Long-term care.—The agreement provides
$8,821,657,000 as requested for long-term care,
including $6,073,862,000 for institutional care
and $2,747,795,000 for non-institutional care.
As indicated in the Senate report, VA is di-
rected to meet its fiscal year 2018 non-insti-
tutional care request as originally proposed
in the advance Medical Services appropria-
tion if that care is not provided through the
Choice program. In order to improve budg-
etary oversight of non-institutional care pro-
grams, the Department is directed to meet
the reporting requirements included in Sen-
ate Report 115–130.
Headache centers of excellence.—The
agreement provides $10,000,000 for the cre-
ation of headache centers of excellence, as
described in the Senate report.
Veterans centers.—The agreement provides
$258,483,000 for readjustment counseling at
Vet Centers, which is $15,000,000 above the
budget request. As described in the Senate
report, within this amount, $2,500,000 is allo-
cated to develop a program to partner with
organizations that provide outdoor experi-
ences for veterans as part of a continuum of
care to treat combat-related injuries, includ-
ing those related to behavioral health. The
Department is also directed to continue to
work to expand Vet Centers and readjust-
ment services at areas across the country
that currently lack access.
Caregivers program.—The agreement pro-
vides $839,828,000 for the caregivers program,
which is the same as the original fiscal year
2018 request and $235,889,000 above the revised
2018 request. The Department is instructed
to provide quarterly reports on obligations
for the caregivers program, with a full expla-
nation of any inability to obligate the origi-
nal 2018 request.
Dental care.—As part of VA’s comprehen-
sive medical benefits package, certain eligi-
ble veterans also qualify for dental care ben-
efits. In some instances, VA is authorized to
provide extensive dental care, while in other
cases treatment may be limited. In order to
better understand the full array of services
provided, and the locations in which they are
provided, the Department is directed to sub-
mit a report to the Committees no later than
60 days after enactment of this Act, describ-
ing the types of services provided to eligible
veterans, as well as a list of on-site dental
clinics by location and medical center. The
report should also include any implementa-
tion plans to expand on-sight dental care,
particularly in States in which there are cur-
rently no services offered by VA or which
have no on-site VA dental clinics.
Homeless assistance programs.—The agree-
ment provides $1,747,784,000 for homeless as-
sistance programs, which includes
$340,000,000 for the homeless supportive serv-
ices for low income veterans and families, a
level which is $20,000,000 above the request.
Housing and Urban Development-Veterans
Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH).—
The agreement includes full funding for the
HUD-VASH program. However, if additional
new vouchers are issued in fiscal year 2018 by
the Department of Housing and Urban Devel-
opment for the HUD/VASH program. VA is
directed to increase funding for this program
above the budget estimate to ensure ade-
quate staffing levels exist to manage the in-
creased workload. Further, the Department
is directed to submit to the Committee on
Appropriations no later than 30 days after
enactment of this Act the amount above the
budget estimate that has been made avail-
able for this purpose.
High-cost areas.—There is a need for an ex-
amination of the effects of rapidly rising
rents in urban areas across the nation and
strategies to create and retain affordable
housing options for veterans. Avoiding the
displacement of veterans and their families
in these communities should be a top pri-
ority at the Department. Therefore, the Sec-
retary is directed, in consultation with the
Secretary of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment, to submit a report detailing the best
practices and recommendations to address
the displacement of lower-income veterans
who are long-time residents in urban areas
when there is a loss of affordable housing due
to high rental cost. This report shall be sub-
mitted to the Committees no later than 180
days after enactment of this Act.
Curing Hepatitis C within the veteran pop-
ulation.—The Department should be com-
mended on its successful efforts to treat al-
most 100,000 veterans. Since VA has been
successful in negotiating lower prices for the
drugs used to cure hepatitis C, it has obli-
gated less funding than anticipated. There-
fore, the agreement includes a rescission
(Section 237) and reappropriation (within the
Medical Services account) of $751,000,000 to
prevent the funding already provided from
lapsing. The Department is directed to con-
tinue to aggressively fund the Hepatitis C
program consistent with its fiscal year 2018
budget request.
Hepatitis C screening.—There is a cohort
of veterans who are more difficult to screen,
engage, and treat for hepatitis C, due to fac-
tors such as the inability to adhere to ther-
apy, psychosocial determinants, unstable or
uncontrolled medical comorbidities, and en-
rollment barriers and challenges. The De-
partment is directed to improve hepatitis C
screening rates in traditional and non-tradi-
tional settings, including increasing the uti-
lization of innovative strategies like point-
of-care testing and public health outreach.
The Department is directed to submit a re-
port to the Committees no later than 120
days after enactment of this Act on VA’s ef-
forts to facilitate this directive.
Incorrect reporting of laboratory tests.—
According to press reports, in February 2018,
at least 8 veterans in the Miami area were
given incorrect lab results indicating that
they did not test positive for the presence of
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), when
in fact they did have the virus and needed
treatment. The VA Inspector General is di-
rected to provide a report to the Committees
describing how the incident at the Miami VA
hospital occurred and who was responsible.
This report shall be submitted no later than
180 days after enactment of this Act. The
agreement further directs that the Govern-
ment Accountability Office (GAO) provide a
report to the Committees that examines
VA’s HIV testing policy, including the use of
the latest technologies, and how this policy
is implemented at a sample of VA hospitals.
This report shall be submitted no later than
180 days after enactment of this Act.
Hospice care for veterans.—As described in
the House and Senate reports, the Depart-
ment is directed to conduct a study on the
feasibility of implementing hospice care pro-
tocols tailored to the unique needs of combat
VerDate Sep 11 2014 04:44 Mar 28, 2018 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00121 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A22MR7.049 H22MRPT3
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2818 March 22, 2018
veterans, with special emphasis on the needs
of Vietnam veterans.
Intimate Partner Violence Program.—The
agreement provides $17,000,000 for the Inti-
mate Partner Violence Program within the
Medical Services account, which is the base
level of funding for the program and the
amount identified in the Senate report.
Colorectal cancer screening.—The Depart-
ment is directed to offer all 7 colorectal can-
cer screening strategies recommended by the
United States Preventive Services Task
Force and adopted by the National Com-
mittee for Quality Assurance Healthcare Ef-
fectiveness Data and Information Set meas-
ures, which are used by more than 90 percent
of U.S. health plans to measure performance.
The Department is directed to report to the
Committees within 90 days of enactment of
this Act if it determines that it is unable to
comply with this directive.
National Veteran Sports Program.—The
agreement provides $16,965,000 for the Na-
tional Veterans Sports Program, with
$2,000,000 designated for veterans monthly
assistance allowances; $9,000,000 for the
Adaptive Sports Grants Program; and
$5,965,000 for support of national veterans
sports and special events programs like the
Paralympics. The agreement includes nec-
essary bill language within the Medical
Services account to permit VHA to carry out
the Office’s activities.
Equine therapy.—The Adaptive Sports Pro-
gram awards small grants for equine ther-
apy, mostly for physical disabilities. An ad-
ditional $1,000,000 above the request is pro-
vided to the Adaptive Sports Program to en-
courage VA to increase its use of Adaptive
Sports Program grants for equine therapy
for mental health issues, given the promising
results reported using equine therapy for
veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder.
Burn pits.—The agreement provides
$5,000,000 for the purpose of implementing
the recommendations included in National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine’s assessment to improve the VA
open burn pit registry.
Specialized and modular prosthetics.—As
referenced in the House report, the field of
specialized and modular prosthetics is evolv-
ing at a faster pace than VA has been able to
match. There is concern that VA does not
have an effective, streamlined model of serv-
ice for specialized or innovative modular
prosthetics, unlike both the DOD and the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,
which have begun to explore this field.
Therefore, the agreement directs VA to con-
duct comparative analyses of prosthetic
manufacturing processes and determine
whether it has the capacity to use the ‘‘best
of breed’’ manufacturing processes in cases
where it directly produces the prosthesis.
This report shall be submitted to the Com-
mittees no later than 90 days after enact-
ment of this Act.
Proposed prosthetics regulation.—VA has
included a provision in its proposed regula-
tion on prosthetic and rehabilitative items
and services that may limit veterans’ choice
in obtaining prosthetic, orthotic and other
rehabilitative services. The regulation ap-
pears to give the Department sole authority
to choose the provider of the services, con-
trary to the current practice of giving vet-
erans a choice in these services. VA is en-
couraged to reconsider this issue as it devel-
ops its final regulation.
Partnerships with community providers.—
The Department is encouraged to establish a
pilot program within the Veterans Health
Administration (VHA) to support a partner-
ship between community health centers,
other health providers, and higher education
institutions for the purpose of providing edu-
cation, training, and placement of veterans
into health professions. No later than 60 days
after enactment of this Act, the Department
is directed to submit a report to the Com-
mittees outlining the feasibility and advis-
ability of establishing such a pilot program.
Demand profile.—The creation of a demand
profile of VA healthcare needs across the
country would be important to inform the
proper balance between VA and non-VA care
covered by the Department at VA and non-
VA facilities. The Department is directed to
establish a demand profile for each of the
healthcare services furnished by VA and sub-
mit the findings to the Committees no later
than twelve months after enactment of this
Act. VA is directed to use the demand profile
to inform the capability and capacity of any
non-Department healthcare services pro-
vided. Each demand profile shall include the
following information: (1) the number of re-
quests for the healthcare service; (2) the
number of appointments for the receipt of
the healthcare service, disaggregated by ap-
pointments at VA facilities and appoint-
ments with non-Department healthcare pro-
viders; (3) the capacity of the Department to
provide the healthcare service at VA facili-
ties; and (4) an assessment of the extent to
which the Department needs to use non-De-
partment healthcare providers to provide
healthcare services.
Chiropractic services.—The agreement in-
cludes $5,000,000 for the chiropractic pro-
grams to be developed under the authority of
sec. 245.
MEDICAL COMMUNITY CARE
The agreement provides $8,384,704,000 in ad-
vance fiscal year 2019 funding for Medical
Community Care, with $2,000,000,000 avail-
able through fiscal year 2022. The agreement
also provides $419,176,000 for fiscal year 2018
in addition to the advance appropriation pro-
vided last year.
Due to the timing of reconciliation be-
tween obligations, authorizations, and the
number of those authorizations filled
through private providers, VA’s accounting
procedure has led to the de-obligation of
funds past the life of the budget authority,
leading to the expiration of millions of dol-
lars that could have been applied to veterans
healthcare programs. Therefore, the agree-
ment provides extended availability to aid
the Department in ensuring that it can obli-
gate all appropriations within this account
before expiration.
MEDICAL SUPPORT AND COMPLIANCE
The agreement provides $7,239,156,000 in ad-
vance for fiscal year 2019 for Medical Support
and Compliance and makes $100,000,000 of the
advance funding available through fiscal
year 2020. The agreement also provides
$100,000,000 for fiscal year 2018 in addition to
the advance appropriation provided last
year.
MEDICAL FACILITIES
The agreement provides $5,914,288,000 in ad-
vance for fiscal year 2019 for Medical Facili-
ties, as well as $707,000,000 in fiscal year 2018
funding, which is in addition to the advance
funding provided last year and is made avail-
able for two years. Of the advance funding,
$250,000,000 is made available through fiscal
year 2020.
In addition, $1,000,000,000 is provided for
non-recurring maintenance in section 255 to
be available until expended. The funding is
to be used to correct deficiencies identified
in the VA’s facilities assessments reports as
well as to supplement base funding provided
within this Medical Facilities account.
Bakersfield outpatient clinic.—The
lengthy period VA has taken to lease a new
outpatient clinic in Bakersfield, CA pursuant
to Public Law 111–82 is concerning. Out-
patient clinics greatly reduce the need for
veterans to travel long distances for care by
providing reliable medical services closer to
a veteran’s home. The new outpatient clinic
would replace the Bakersfield community-
based outpatient clinic and would provide
expanded primary care and mental health
services while offering a range of specialty
care clinics. This project would simulta-
neously increase veterans’ access to
healthcare locally as well as reduce the case-
load at other facilities in the VA Greater Los
Angeles Healthcare System. While VA re-
ceived congressional authorization for the
project in fiscal year 2010 and has allocated
funding for it, the project has been delayed
for years and is still in the acquisition phase.
The Department is urged to expedite the
project in light of the urgent need for ex-
panded healthcare services. The Secretary is
directed to report to the Committees no
later than 60 days after enactment of this
Act on past actions and the future plan for-
ward, including the timeline for this project,
and to provide periodic progress reports to
the Committees every 120 days. These peri-
odic progress reports shall include an expla-
nation of any changes to: (1) the project’s
status; (2) the expected cost of the lease; and
(3) the projected completion date.
MEDICAL AND PROSTHETIC RESEARCH
The agreement provides $722,262,000 for
Medical and Prosthetic Research, available
until September 30, 2019. Bill language is in-
cluded to ensure that the Secretary allocates
adequate funding for research on gender-ap-
propriate prosthetics and toxic exposures.
Exoskeleton research.—As indicated in the
Senate report, VA is directed to study the ef-
ficacy of exoskeletons in the rehabilitation
of patients who have suffered a stroke or
traumatic brain injury.
Cancer moonshot.—As indicated in the
Senate report, the Department is urged to
include skin cancer as a subject of its efforts
to provide targeted cancer treatments to
veterans through genomic science.
Rare cancers.—The disproportionate im-
pact of rare cancers on veterans, the number
of rare cancers affecting veterans that are
understudied and misunderstood, and inad-
equate treatment options for rare cancers
are concerning. Therefore, the Department is
instructed to provide a report to the Com-
mittees within 90 days of enactment of this
Act for each of the last five years: the preva-
lence rate of rare cancers among veterans;
the types of treatments being provided to
veterans specifically for rare cancers; any
studies on rare cancers conducted by the De-
partment; the Department’s expenditures on
the treatment of rare cancers; the Depart-
ment’s programs dedicated to addressing
rare cancers among veterans; and rec-
ommendations on ways the Department can
enhance rare cancer treatments for veterans.
Exposure to Agent Orange by certain Navy
veterans.—As described in the Senate report,
beginning in 2002, a revised VA interpreta-
tion of the Agent Orange Act of 1991 (Public
Law 102–4) has prevented ‘‘Blue Water’’ Navy
veterans who served in the Navy outside of
the riverine and coastal areas from col-
lecting benefits unless they could prove that
they stepped onto land or that their ship en-
tered the internal river system of the Repub-
lic of Vietnam. However, a growing body of
research supports the resumption of the pre-
sumption of exposure for these veterans.
Subsequently, the Secretary has testified be-
fore the House Veterans Affairs Committee
that he believes these veterans should be ex-
tended the presumption of exposure. The De-
partment is directed to submit a report to
the Committees no later than 180 days after
enactment of this Act evaluating each of the
U.S. and non-U.S. studies on Agent Orange
exposure and any additional relevant mate-
rial. The report should also include any jus-
tification for the continued exclusion policy

or, in the alternative, detail the intent,
along with associated milestones, for lifting
the exclusion policy.
NATIONAL CEMETERY ADMINISTRATION
The agreement provides $306,193,000 for the
National Cemetery Administration (NCA). Of
the amount provided, not to exceed 10 per-
cent is available until September 30, 2019.
Burial rights for Hmong veterans.—The
agreement includes section 251 permitting
burial in a National Cemetery Administra-
tion national cemetery for any Hmong vet-
erans naturalized pursuant to the Hmong
Veterans’ Naturalization Act of 2000, who
served on behalf of the United States during
the Vietnam War, and who were residing in
the United States at the time of the individ-
ual’s death. The Department is instructed to
conduct an analysis of the number of sur-
viving Hmong veterans who served in Viet-
nam on behalf of the United States and who
would not be eligible for burial in a VA na-
tional cemetery under the provisions of sec-
tion 251. This analysis should be submitted
to the Committees no later than 180 days
after enactment of this Act.
Deferred maintenance.—Given the weak-
nesses in the Facilities Condition Assess-
ment currently used by NCA, as described in
the House report, NCA is encouraged to pilot
in one region the U.S. Army Corps of Engi-
neers’ Sustainment Management System
(SMS). The procurement of the SMS is avail-
able to VA without cost. The SMS provides
automated, predictive modeling that may
provide more accurate data to model future
maintenance needs. Since other groups with-
in VA also currently use the Facilities Con-
dition Assessment, this pilot may provide a
useful test to see if the SMS has utility de-
partment-wide. VA is directed to inform the
Committees of its plans to pilot the SMS, in-
cluding the region chosen, the expected cost,
and planned start date and duration of the
pilot. If VA determines it is unable to con-
duct the pilot, it is directed to report to the
Committees the reasons why.
DEPARTMENTAL ADMINISTRATION
GENERAL ADMINISTRATION
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The agreement provides $335,891,000 for
General Administration. Of the amount pro-
vided, not to exceed 10 percent is available
for obligation until September 30, 2019. The
agreement continues to include bill language
permitting the transfer of funds from this
account to General Operating Expenses, Vet-
erans Benefits Administration.
Recording of obligations.—VA is in the
process of changing its accounting for obli-
gations for healthcare services purchased
from non-VA providers. Up to this time, such
obligations have been recorded at the time
the health care services were authorized. Ob-
ligations were later adjusted after
healthcare services were rendered, and VA
received a claim for payment, VA evaluated
the claim to ensure that it was allowable,
and VA approved the claim for payment. Be-
cause of the lag in the time between the date
services were rendered and the date a claim
was processed, approved and paid, approxi-
mately 75 percent of the preliminary fiscal
year 2017 obligations were based on VA’s
‘‘best estimate’’ of services that a veteran
might or might not receive. This is because
the amount of VA’s final liability was con-
tingent on the veteran seeking health care
services and the type and length of services
that were provided by the non-VA provider.
The proposed accounting change will mean
that obligations will be recorded at the time
claims are processed and approved, thereby
eliminating the uncertainty regarding the
actual total obligations against the program.
The Department believes that this change in
obligation procedure will improve program
management and the ability to forecast and
justify budget requirements. The Commit-
tees concur with the VA proposal, noting the
Comptroller General has opined in the past
that VA could determine whether the gov-
ernment should accept liability for non-VA
health care claims following a review and ap-
proval process and record obligations upon
approval. This proposal matches the system
DOD uses for its non-Department healthcare
claims.
Staff vacancies.—As indicated in the Sen-
ate report, VA is directed to use funds pro-
vided by this Act to fill its staff vacancies
and to report monthly on its progress in
doing so.
Financial management system.—The
agreement includes $10,800,000 in this ac-
count, as well as $83,000,000 in the Informa-
tion Technology Systems account for devel-
opment of a new financial management sys-
tem. The VA agreement to use the Depart-
ment of Agriculture’s Federal Shared Serv-
ices financial management system has bro-
ken down and VA is trying to use the con-
tracts USDA had set up to reconstruct the fi-
nancial management system it had antici-
pated acquiring through USDA. It is con-
cerning that VA is trying to move forward
alone, given the disastrous outcomes of its
two previous attempts to create a modern fi-
nancial management system. VA is directed
to provide a report to the Committees within
60 days of enactment of this Act that de-
scribes the components that will be included
in its planned financial management system,
such as acquisition, the cost of the contracts
and staffing that VA has acquired from
USDA, the annual and total costs of the
project, and its timeline and performance
benchmarks. The report should also include
a description of interim steps the Depart-
ment is taking to improve the timeliness of
payments made to healthcare providers and
vendors while the FMS is being developed.
Upon submission of this report, VA is di-
rected to provide the Committees on a quar-
terly basis a report that compares actual
progress on the financial management sys-
tem to the performance benchmarks and
timeline provided in the first report.
Inconsistencies in contracting policy after
the Kingdomware decision.—VA issued guid-
ance to implement the Kingdomware deci-
sion of June 2016, which held that the VA
‘‘must use the Rule of Two when awarding
contracts, even when the Department will
otherwise meet its annual minimum con-
tracting goals’’ and that it must be applied
to Federal Supply Schedule purchase orders.
The VA guidance outlined ways to identify
potential vendors and evaluate their capa-
bilities. However, there is concern that VA’s
guidance is being interpreted inconsistently
across the VISNs. In some VISNs, option
years are not being exercised as anticipated,
but instead, are being re-bid to satisfy the
‘‘Rule of Two’’ retroactively based on a mis-
interpretation of the Supreme Court’s rul-
ing.
A report by the GAO (GAO–17–748) high-
lighted similar concerns. The GAO report
identified significant inconsistencies be-
tween national policies set by the VA and
implementation of those policies at the re-
gional and local levels. The report empha-
sized that VA has not established a process
for systematically ensuring that local poli-
cies are aligned with national policies.
To ensure veterans’ continued access to
quality care, VA is urged to issue additional
guidance to provide a standard set of criteria
for contracting officers to evaluate veteran-
owned providers’ capabilities and to take
steps to ensure their implementation in a
consistent manner across the VISNs, in
alignment with the GAO’s recommendations,
especially with regard to option years.
BOARD OF VETERANS APPEALS
The agreement provides $161,048,000 for the
Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA), of which
not to exceed 10 percent shall remain avail-
able until September 30, 2019. Funding above
the budget request is to be used to assist in
streamlining the appeals process, with the
new authorities provided by Congress. Bill
language continues to be included in section
230 permitting VA to transfer funding be-
tween this account and the General Oper-
ating Expenses, Veterans Benefits Adminis-
tration account if needed to align funding
with the appropriate account to hire staff to
address the appeals backlog.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)
The agreement provides $4,055,500,000 for
Information Technology (IT) Systems. The
agreement identifies separately in bill lan-
guage the funding available for pay
($1,230,320,000); operations and maintenance
($2,496,650,000); and systems development
($328,530,000). The agreement makes not to
exceed 5 percent of pay and of operations and
maintenance funding available until the end
of fiscal year 2019; not to exceed 5 percent of
operations and maintenance funding avail-
able until the end of fiscal year 2019, and all
IT systems development funding available
until the end of fiscal year 2019.
The agreement includes $63,404,000 in infor-
mation technology funding for the Veterans
Benefits Management System which proc-
esses disability claims; $7,500,000 for the BVA
claims appeals modernization effort;
$83,000,000 for development of a new VA fi-
nancial management system; and $340,000,000
for the Office of Information Security.
The agreement continues language prohib-
iting the obligation of IT development fund-
ing until VA submits a certification of the
amounts to be obligated, in part or in full,
for each development project.
The agreement continues language permit-
ting funding to be transferred among the
three IT subaccounts, subject to approval
from the Committees.
The agreement continues language pro-
viding that funding may be transferred
among development projects or to new
projects subject to the Committees’ ap-
proval.
The agreement continues language indi-
cating that no development project may be
increased or decreased by more than
$1,000,000 prior to receiving approval of the
Committees or a period of 30 days has
elapsed.
The agreement provides funding for IT de-
velopment for the projects and in the
amounts specified in the following table:
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
(in thousands of dollars)
Project Agreement
VLER Health ............................................................................... 10,000
VistA Module Enhancements ..................................................... 9,000

This table is intended to serve as the De-
partment’s approved list of development
projects; any requested changes are subject
to reprogramming requirements.
Expenditure plan.—The Department is di-
rected to continue to provide a fiscal year
2018 IT expenditure plan to the Committees
upon enactment of this Act. This plan should
be in the same format as the table above.
VETERANS ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD

tivities related to the development and roll-
out of a new VA electronic health record, the

associated contractual costs, and the sala-
ries and expenses of employees hired under
titles 5 and 38, United States Code. Because
this is a very substantial new effort, the tim-
ing of obligation of funding is uncertain. As
a result, the agreement makes these funds
available for three years.
This account is intended to be the single
source of funding within VA for the elec-
tronic health record effort. There is no au-
thority for funds from other VA accounts to
be transferred to this account or for funds
from this account to be transferred to other
accounts. Consistent with the effort to cen-
tralize financial management of the develop-
ment of the electronic health record, the De-
partment is directed to place top manage-
ment of the project at the headquarters level
above either the VHA or the Office of Infor-
mation Technology, such as in the Office of
the Deputy Secretary.
The bill language for this account requires
the Secretary to submit a report quarterly
to the Committees detailing obligations, ex-
penditures, and deployment strategy by fa-
cility. In addition, GAO is directed to per-
form quarterly performance reviews of the
VA electronic health record deployment so
that the Committees are kept abreast of im-
portant issues such as cost and operational
capability. It is expected that this quarterly
reporting will avail the Committees and VA
with timely information to properly oversee
this effort and address important issues.
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL
The agreement provides $164,000,000 for the
Office of Inspector General (OIG). Of the
amount provided, not to exceed 10 percent is
available for obligation until September 30,
2019.
CONSTRUCTION, MAJOR PROJECTS
The agreement provides $512,430,000 for
Construction, Major Projects, which is the
same as the budget request. The agreement
makes this funding available for five years,
except that $80,000,000 is made available until
expended.
External project management.—The agree-
ment continues the bill language requiring
that large VA construction projects be man-
aged by a non-VA government entity. Of the
total provided, $117,300,000 for VHA major
construction projects shall not be available
until the Department enters into an agree-
ment with a non-Department of Veterans Af-
fairs Federal entity to serve as the design
and/or construction agent for each major
construction project with a total estimated
cost of $100,000,000 or above. Funding is avail-
able for obligation for each project only
after VA certifies that the agreement with
the non-Department Federal entity is in ef-
fect for that project. The single large VHA
project affected by this provision is in Liver-
more, California.
The requirement to contract with an out-
side agent for major construction projects
was also mandated in Section 502 of the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs Expiring Au-
thorities Act of 2015 (Public Law 114–58), en-
acted on September 30, 2015. Since the provi-
sion in the annual appropriations bill is also
contained in permanent authorizing law, in
future years, this provision will not be in-
cluded in the appropriations bill.
The agreement funds the following items
as requested in the budget submission:

West Los Angeles, California seismic cor-
rections.—VA removed six buildings from
the scope of the West Los Angeles, California
seismic corrections project to be addressed
through the Enhanced Use Lease supportive
housing program. In the fiscal year 2018
budget submission, VA advised that details
would be provided on how the remaining
funding appropriated for the West LA project
would be used. VA’s most urgent need is to
address Building 300, the Regional Food
Services Facility, which is critical for pro-
viding quality service to vulnerable inpa-
tient veterans. The Regional Food Services
Facility is currently housed in a 65 year old,
seismically at-risk facility potentially im-
pacting food quality and safety, and placing
veterans at risk. Renovation of Building 300
was originally included in the scope of the
major project, but VA has determined that
new construction would be more cost-effec-
tive than the originally planned renovation.
The new Food Services facility will be effi-
cient, purpose-built, and centrally located
adjacent to the inpatient facility. VA has es-
timated that the total cost for new construc-
tion of the approximately 25,000 gross square
foot Food Services facility is $35,000,000. VA
is directed to utilize $35,000,000 of the re-
maining funds from the West Los Angeles,
California Seismic Corrections major con-
struction project for construction of the
Food Service facility. Further, it is expected
that the vacated Building 300 site will be
used to support the Department’s stated goal
of developing at least 1,200 housing units on
the campus by 2026. VA is directed to provide
to the Committees no later than 60 days
after enactment of this Act an estimated
schedule for completion of the Food Services
facility.
Strategic Capital Investment Plan
(SCIP).—It is appreciated that VA has con-
sulted with the Committees and will be
modifying its future capital budget and long
term capital plan, with its submission to in-
clude a clearer presentation of its capital
needs, by year, over the next five years. In
addition, VA will make improvements to the
congressional justification to make it a
more usable and understandable document.
This additional information will provide
more clarity on VA’s future capital plans.
An example of a presentation that accu-
rately reflects the priority projects from the
SCIP that will actually be funded in the re-
quest is the ‘‘Active Development Major
Construction Projects’’’ on page 8.2 11 of Vol-
ume 4 of the fiscal year 2018 justification vol-
umes. VA is encouraged to place such charts
in a more prominent place in the justifica-
tions. VA is also encouraged to ensure that
the funds requested for projects (major,
minor, leases, and non-recurring mainte-
nance) that are presented in congressional
justification documents are in fact allocated
to those projects for execution. VA is di-
rected to report quarterly on the allocation
and execution of such funds for the identified
projects and clearly identify any changes.
Vacant and underutilized buildings and
structures.—In June 2017, the Secretary an-
nounced plans to initiate disposal or reuse
actions for 430 vacant buildings in VA’s real
property inventory in order to decrease the
maintenance of buildings VA does not need
and reinvest the savings. The Secretary also
announced a review of 784 non-vacant but un-
derutilized buildings. While the Depart-
ment’s initiative to review the utility of VA
property is commendable, the process by
which the list of buildings and structures
was created was not transparent. The De-
partment is directed to submit a report to
the Committees no later than 90 days after
enactment of this Act that includes the fol-
lowing elements: (1) an explanation of the
process and methodology used to determine,
record, and validate which buildings and
structures in VA’s real property portfolio are
vacant, mostly vacant, or underutilized, and
their physical condition; (2) an explanation
of the process by which those property dis-
posal analyses and plans were developed and
coordinated with, and within, each VISN; (3)
a cost-benefit analysis of the Department’s
ongoing real property disposal plans, both in
terms of this immediate disposal action, and
in aggregate; (4) a discussion of the impact of
historic designations of buildings and struc-
tures on the Department’s ability to manage
its real property portfolio; and (5) a certifi-
cation that the disposal of these identified
properties will have no significant adverse
impact on the Department’s ability to pro-
vide health care and benefits for veterans.
National realignment strategy.—It is un-
derstood the Department, as part of a na-
tional realignment strategy of VA services,
will continue to reevaluate and scrutinize
the utility of facilities and property as well
as the healthcare services available at VA
facilities and available through non-Depart-
ment healthcare providers. The Department
is prohibited from diminishing healthcare
services at existing VHA medical facilities
as part of a planned realignment of VA serv-
ices until the Secretary provides justifica-
tion to the Committees.
CONSTRUCTION, MINOR PROJECTS
The agreement provides $342,570,000 for
Construction, Minor Projects. The agree-
ment makes this funding available for five
years. Included within the total is
$193,610,000 for the Veterans Health Adminis-
tration; $97,950,000 for the National Cemetery
Administration; $29,895,000 for the Veterans
Benefits Administration; and $21,115,000 for
General Administration—Staff Offices.
In addition, $425,000,000 is provided for
minor construction projects in section 255 to
remain available until expended.
Expenditure plan.—The agreement in-
cludes a directive for the Department to pro-
vide an expenditure plan no later than 30
days after the enactment of this Act. This
expenditure plan shall include a complete
list of minor construction projects to be sup-
ported with the fiscal year 2018 appropria-
tion. The plan shall be updated six months
and twelve months after enactment.
GRANTS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF STATE
EXTENDED CARE FACILITIES
The agreement provides $110,000,000 for
Grants for Construction of State Extended
Care Facilities, to remain available until ex-
pended.
The agreement includes in section 253 a
provision ensuring that the priority order for
eligible and approved, but unfunded, State
projects in 2017 is not disrupted by priority
designated for approved 2018 projects.
The agreement includes section 255 which
provides an additional $575,000,000 for grants

for construction of State extended care fa-
cilities to be available until expended. This
funding, coupled with the base funding of
$110,000,000 and fiscal year 2017 carryover
should be sufficient to support the entire ex-
isting backlog of approved State applica-
tions.
VA is encouraged to prioritize the needs of
rural States in its allocation of funding for
State homes by: (1) including consideration
of rural mileage access in its ‘‘great need for
beds to be established’’ at a State home; (2)
considering the unique needs of small States
with a single facility; and (3) prioritizing
large rural States where veterans may live
hundreds of miles from the nearest facility.
GRANTS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF VETERANS
CEMETERIES
The agreement provides $45,000,000 for
Grants for Construction of Veterans Ceme-
teries, to remain available until expended.

March 22, 2018
DIVISION K—DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
FOREIGN OPERATIONS, AND RELATED
PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018
In implementing this agreement, Federal
departments, agencies, commissions, and
other entities are directed to comply with
the directives, reporting requirements, and
instructions contained in H. Rept. 115–253
(House report) accompanying H.R. 3362
(House bill) and S. Rept. 115–152 (Senate re-
port) accompanying S. 1780 (Senate bill) as
though stated in this explanatory statement,
unless specifically directed to the contrary.
This explanatory statement, while repeat-
ing some House and Senate report language
for emphasis or clarification, does not ne-
gate language in such reports unless ex-
pressly provided herein. Language expressing
an opinion or making an observation in the
House or Senate reports represents the view
of the respective committee unless specifi-
cally endorsed in this explanatory state-
ment. In cases in which the House and Sen-
ate reports provide contradictory directives
or instructions that are not addressed in this
explanatory statement, such directives or in-
structions are negated.
Reports required to be submitted pursuant
to the Act, including reports required by this
explanatory statement and the House and
Senate reports, may not be consolidated to
include responses to multiple requirements
in a single report, except following consulta-
tion with the Committees on Appropriations.
In lieu of the tables contained in the House
and Senate reports, the tables contained in
this explanatory statement shall guide de-
partments, agencies, commissions, and other
entities when allocating funds.
Section 7019 requires that amounts des-
ignated in the respective tables referenced in
this explanatory statement for funds appro-
priated in titles III through V shall be made
available in such designated amounts, unless
otherwise provided for in the Act, and shall
be the basis of the report required by section
653(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961
(FAA) (the 653(a) report), where applicable.
The section also includes limited authority
to deviate from such specified amounts and
continues language similar to prior years in-
cluding exceptions to the application of the
requirements of such section for amounts
designated in tables included in this explana-
tory statement for International Military
Education and Training and Global Health
Programs, and funds for which the initial pe-
riod of availability has expired.
Proposed deviations from tables in titles I
and II in this explanatory statement are sub-
ject to the regular notification procedures of
the Committees on Appropriations, unless an
exception or deviation authority is specifi-
cally provided herein.
For the purposes of the Act, the term ‘‘reg-
ular notification procedures of the Commit-
tees on Appropriations’’ means such Com-
mittees are notified not less than 15 days in
advance of the initial obligation of funds.
For purposes of the Act, the term ‘‘prior
consultation’’ shall mean a pre-decisional
engagement between a relevant Federal
agency and the Committees on Appropria-
tions during which such Committees are pro-
vided a meaningful opportunity to provide
relevant facts and opinions to inform the use
of funds; the development, content, or con-
duct of a program or activity; or a decision
to be taken.
In meeting the requirements of section
7076(e) of the Act, the Department of State
and the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development (USAID) shall include
in congressional budget justifications (CBJs)
the justifications for multi-year availability
for funds requested under Diplomatic and
Consular Programs and Operating Expenses.
The Department of State, USAID, and other
agencies are also directed to include in CBJs
the information included in the Introduction
of the Senate report under Congressional
Budget Request and Justifications, as appli-
cable.
The Department of State, USAID, and
other agencies funded by the Act are di-
rected to notify the Committees on Appro-
priations of: (1) reprogrammings of funds, as
required by sections 7015 and 7019 of the Act,
at the most detailed level of the CBJ, the
Act, or this explanatory statement; (2) sig-
nificant departures in funding from the CBJ
or the 653(a) report to be submitted 30 days
after enactment of the Act; and (3) plans for
restructuring the department or agency in-
volving funding or staffing changes in ac-
cordance with section 7081 of the Act.
CBJ documents, and operating and spend
plans, shall not suffice for purposes of satis-
fying special notification requirements con-
tained in the Act.
As in prior fiscal years, additional funding
designated as Overseas Contingency Oper-
ations/Global War on Terrorism (OCO/GWOT)
pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emer-
gency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA)
is contained in title VIII of the Act. Such
funds are intended to address the extraor-
dinary costs of operations and assistance in
countries in conflict and areas of instability
and violence, particularly in the Middle
East, South Asia, and Africa; security, sta-
bilization, and peacekeeping programs; hu-
manitarian activities; and counterterrorism
and counterinsurgency efforts.
For purposes of the Act, the ‘‘term extrem-
ist organization’’ means the Islamic State of
Iraq and Syria (ISIS); organizations affili-
ated with ISIS; a foreign organization that is
determined to be engaged in terrorist activ-
ity, as defined in section 212(a)(3)(B) of the
Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.
1182); and other entities designated as for-
eign terrorist organizations pursuant to sec-
tion 219 of such Act. The term ‘‘extremist’’
means an individual affiliated with an ex-
tremist organization. The term ‘‘extremism’’
means the advocacy or use of violence by
such organizations or individuals to achieve
political or religious goals.

LATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS
ACT, 2018
CONGRESSIONAL DIRECTIVES
Unless otherwise noted, the language and
allocations set forth in the House report
(House Report 115–237) and the Senate report
(Senate Report 115–138) carry the same
weight as the language included in this joint
explanatory statement and should be com-
plied with unless specifically addressed to
the contrary in this division or joint explan-
atory statement. House report language and
Senate report language, neither of which is
changed by this joint explanatory statement,
is a result of the 2018 appropriations agree-
ment. The joint explanatory statement,
while repeating some report language for
emphasis, does not intend to negate the lan-
guage referred to above unless expressly pro-
vided herein. In cases where the House or the
Senate has directed the submission of a re-
port, such report is to be submitted to both
the House and Senate Committees on Appro-
priations. The Department of Transportation
and the Department of Housing and Urban
Development are directed to notify the
House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions seven days prior to the announcement
of a new program, initiative, or authority.
Any reprogramming requests must be sub-
mitted to the Committees on Appropriations
no later than June 30, 2018.
TITLE I—DEPARTMENT OF
TRANSPORTATION
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
SALARIES AND EXPENSES
The agreement provides $112,813,000 for the
salaries and expenses of the Office of the
Secretary. The agreement includes funding
by office as specified below, and offices are
to manage staffing levels within the
amounts provided. Funds are available for
transfer between all offices under certain
conditions.

Consumer protections.—The Department
has, in recent years, initiated a process to
establish more transparency in displaying
the total prices of airfare tickets and related
charges. Whether consumers are purchasing
directly from the airlines or through ticket
agents, consumers should have clear and ac-
curate pricing information when choosing
among various air transportation options.
Currently, fees for additional services can be
difficult to determine when searching for
airfares, and, as a result, consumers may be
unable to understand the true cost of travel
when comparing prices. To enhance con-
sumers’ choices and provide consumers with
full airline ticket pricing information, the
agreement directs the Department to work
in collaboration with industry, consumers,
and other stakeholders to establish guide-
lines which should lead to airlines or any
for-profit seller of commercial air transpor-
tation displaying, on an airline’s website or
any travel metasearch website with which
the airline is partnered, full ticketing
charges, including, but not limited to, seat
price, any additional fees the consumer will
pay per piece of baggage or per seat upgrade,
and optional flight insurance costs. As a re-
sult, all the charges should be clear to the
consumer, at the time of the initial search,
and the anticipated total charges fully dis-
closed. The Secretary is directed to provide a
report to the House and Senate Committees
on Appropriations on the progress being
made to establish these guidelines within 180
days of enactment of this Act.
RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY
The agreement provides $23,465,109 for the
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Re-
search and Technology, of which $2,618,000
shall remain available until September 30,
2020.
University transportation centers.—The
agreement provides $15,000,000 in additional
funding for the University Transportation
Center (UTC) program as authorized under
the FAST Act. This additional funding is for
competitive grants for a national center for
congestion research, focusing on congestion
relief, and a national center for infrastruc-
ture research, focusing on improving the du-
rability and extending the life of transpor-
tation infrastructure. The increase is in ad-
dition to amounts provided for fiscal year
2018 by the FAST Act for a total UTC fund-
ing level of $90,000,000. The agreement con-
tinues to direct the Department to award no
less than $3,000,000 of the amounts provided
under the FAST Act for research on rural au-
tonomous vehicles and connected vehicles to
be conducted by existing UTC universities.
NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS
The agreement provides $1,500,000,000 for
capital investments in surface transpor-
tation infrastructure, commonly known as
the ‘‘TIGER’’ program, to remain available
until September 30, 2020. The Department is
directed to administer the program within
its current staffing levels.
NATIONAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION AND
INNOVATIVE FINANCE BUREAU
The agreement provides $3,000,000 for the
national surface transportation and innova-
tive finance bureau. The agreement does not
make an additional $3,000,000 available by
transfer from the Maritime Guaranteed
(Title XI) Loan Program account and does
not expect the bureau to administer the
Title XI program in fiscal year 2018.
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT CAPITAL
The agreement provides $6,000,000 for the
financial management capital program, to
remain available until September 30, 2020,
which includes resources for the continued
execution of Data Act compliance require-
ments at the Department.
CYBER SECURITY INITIATIVES
The agreement provides $15,000,000 for de-
partmental cyber security initiatives, to re-
main available until September 30, 2019.
OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS
The agreement provides $9,500,000 for the
office of civil rights.
TRANSPORTATION PLANNING, RESEARCH, AND
DEVELOPMENT
The agreement provides $14,000,000 for
planning, research, and development activi-
ties, of which $1,500,000 is for the Interagency
Infrastructure Permitting Improvement Cen-
ter (IIPIC) and $5,500,000 is for the safety
data and automated vehicle safety data ini-
tiatives, to remain available until expended.
Bill language is included to allow for the
transfer of funds to this account from other
Federal agencies utilizing the services of the
IIPIC.
WORKING CAPITAL FUND
The agreement limits expenditures for
working capital fund activities to
$202,245,000.
MINORITY BUSINESS RESOURCE CENTER
PROGRAM
The agreement provides a total appropria-
tion of $500,301 for the minority business cen-
ter program for administrative expenses, in-
cluding education outreach activities, moni-
toring of existing loans, and modification of
existing loans. No funding is provided to sup-
port the subsidy cost of new loan guarantees,
and no additional limitation on guaranteed
loans is provided as those functions are ad-
ministered by the Small Business Adminis-
tration.
SMALL AND DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS
UTILIZATION AND OUTREACH
The agreement provides $4,646,000 for small
and disadvantaged business utilization and
outreach, to remain available until Sep-

PAYMENTS TO AIR CARRIERS
(AIRPORT AND AIRWAY TRUST FUND)
The agreement provides $155,000,000 for
payments to air carriers, to remain available
until expended.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS—OFFICE OF THE
SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION
Section 101 prohibits funds available to the
Department of Transportation from being
obligated for the Office of the Secretary of
Transportation to approve assessments or re-
imbursable agreements pertaining to funds
appropriated to the modal administrations,
except for activities underway on the date of
enactment of this Act, unless such assess-
ments or agreements have completed the
normal reprogramming process for Congres-
sional notification.
Section 102 requires the Secretary of
Transportation to post on the internet a
schedule of all Council on Credit and Fi-
nance meetings, agendas, and meeting min-
utes.
Section 103 allows the Department of
Transportation Working Capital Fund to
provide payments in advance to vendors for
the Federal transit pass fringe benefit pro-
gram and to provide full or partial payments

provided, $8,851,000,000 is to be derived from
the airport and airway trust fund. Funds are
distributed in the bill by budget activity.
The following table compares the agree-
ment to the levels proposed in the budget re-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2873
March 22, 2018
Organization designation authorization.—
The agreement modifies language that was
included in the House and Senate bills re-
garding the FAA’s Organization Designation
Authorization (ODA) in order to advance the
certification of new aviation technologies
and products. Utilization of ODAs is key to
improving the effectiveness and efficiency of
product certification. With funds made avail-
able under this agreement, the FAA should
ensure that ODAs conduct all of the specified
activities authorized and approved by the
FAA in its procedures manual while the FAA
continues to conduct its core responsibility
of safety oversight and to take action if a
systemic airworthiness noncompliance per-
formance issue has been identified and docu-
mented. The agreement recognizes that, for
safety oversight, the FAA considers a vari-
ety of mechanisms, including inspections,
whistleblower alerts, and customer safety
concerns.
Contract towers.—The agreement includes
$165,000,000 for the contract tower program
and establishes new requirements for the
FAA to expedite entry into the program for
towers that have met cost-benefit require-
ments.
Controller hiring.—The agreement directs
the FAA to continue to update the House

tary penalties on the Department for failing
to meet reporting deadlines; however, the
House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions expect the Department to comply with
the reporting deadlines herein.
Performance-based contract administra-
tors (PBCAs).—The agreement notes that
PBCA services are integral to the Depart-
ment’s efforts to provide effective and effi-
cient oversight and monitoring of this pro-
gram, reduce improper payments, protect
tenants, and ensure that properties are well
maintained. In December 2017, the Depart-
ment issued two solicitations, numbered
86546A18R00001 and 86546A18R00002, to procure
PBCA services on a competitive basis. Due to
the overwhelming critical responses from in-
dustry and stakeholders, the Department
chose to cancel these solicitations, and the
House and Senate Committees on Appropria-
tions find such action appropriate. In keep-
ing with the Administration’s direction, the
agreement supports the cancellation of these
solicitations for the remainder of the fiscal
year. In addition, the agreement directs the
Department to report to the House and Sen-
ate Committees on Appropriations within 90
days of enactment of this Act on the staffing
and funding requirements in the Office of
Multifamily Housing Programs and the Of-
fice of the Chief Procurement Officer that
would be necessary to undertake and oversee
a state-by-state contracting methodology, as
compared to the cancelled proposals.

Section 202 program, to remain available

shall be for new capital advances and
project-based rental assistance contracts,
and up to $90,000,000 shall be for service coor-
dinators and the continuation of existing
congregate service grants. The appropria-
tion, plus carryover balances and residual re-
ceipts, fully funds all renewals, amendments,
and property inspections related to project-
based rental assistance contracts, senior
preservation rental assistance contracts,
service coordinators, and existing con-
gregate service grants.
HOUSING FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
The agreement provides $229,600,000 for the
Section 811 program to remain available
until September 30, 2021. The appropriation,
plus carryover balances and residual re-

assistance contract amendments and renew-
als. The agreement includes $82,600,000 for
new capital advance and project rental as-
sistance awards and directs HUD to

TRUST FUND
The agreement provides $11,000,000 for the
manufactured housing standards programs,
of which $11,000,000 is to be derived from fees
collected and deposited in the Manufactured

rects that not less than $3,600,000 is for pay-
ments to State Administrative Agency part-
ners and not less than $4,000,000 is for the
monitoring of manufacturers’ compliance
with construction and safety standards by
third party inspection agencies. The Depart-
ment has issued a final rule, interpretive
bulletin, and memorandum regarding the on-
site completion of construction of manufac-
tured homes cited in section 424 of H.R. 3354
that has caused concern among various
stakeholders. The agreement directs the De-
partment to review such rule, interpretive
bulletin, and memorandum, and develop a so-
lution that ensures the safety of consumers
and minimizes costs and burdensome re-
quirements on manufacturers and con-
sumers. The agreement also directs the De-
partment to explore if state and local plan-
ning and permitting agencies should have ju-
risdiction over on-site completion and to
provide a report to the House and Senate
Committees on Appropriations within 120
days of enactment of this Act.
