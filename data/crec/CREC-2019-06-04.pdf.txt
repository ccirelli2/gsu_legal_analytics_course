DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO
TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker:

HONORING USMC SERGEANT
GERALD GWALTNEY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr.
Speaker, I rise to recognize U.S. Ma-
rine Corps Sergeant Gerald Gwaltney.
An Alexander County native, Ser-
geant Gwaltney was sent on four major
landings in the Pacific during World
War II, including Iwo Jima, where he
witnessed the iconic American flag
raising there.
In the line of duty, Sergeant
Gwaltney sacrificed himself for his
men, costing him the use of his right
hand. Even after brushing with death
and experiencing the horrors of com-
bat, this selfless patriot said he would
do it all over again.
This year, President Trump signed a
law directing the Secretary of Defense
to conduct a commemorative program
for the 75th anniversary of World War
II. It is important to take such oppor-
tunities like this week’s commemora-
tion of the 75th anniversary of D-day to
highlight heroes like Sergeant
Gwaltney and remember the brave
Americans who fought and died for our
country in World War II to preserve
our freedom.
f
CRISIS AT THE BORDER
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I
rise with a heavy heart, but I still love
my country. I rise today, some 48 days
now since the Mueller report was made
public, some 48 days for all who have
said that the President should be im-
peached and that he has broken the
law, some 48 days now the President
has been above the law—48 days.
But as we continue this journey, let
us remember this: There are still chil-
dren who have been separated from
their parents. Let us please remember
there is a new story today about this
separation. Let us remember separa-
tion doesn’t always mean that the
child was separated from a mother or a
father, but perhaps a grandparent or
some other person who was a signifi-
cant other in that person’s life, some-
body whom the child had some sense of
belief in or belonging to.
And let us remember, please, that
these children are among the least, the
last, and the lost. These are not per-
sons who were born into plenty—likely,
born into extreme poverty. These are
not persons who were born in the land
of liberty and justice for all. These are
persons who are seeking liberty and
justice. These are persons who are try-
ing to flee harm’s way. These are ba-
bies.
One can only imagine what grief a
parent suffers knowing that the child
has been removed from the custody of
the parent and is not able to be recon-
nected.
Let us just imagine ourselves: What
would we do if our child were taken
from us as we were trying to journey
toward freedom, if we were trying to
escape harm’s way, and when we fi-
nally get to a point where we think
that the laws that are applicable would
apply to us, our child was removed
from us? What would we do?
This is the United States of America.
These laws are in place. Those who be-
moan the fact that people are coming
and seeking asylum should remember
that the law allows what they are
doing. They are not breaking the law
when they walk up to the border and
say, ‘‘I am seeking asylum,’’ when they
give the pronouncement as to why and
it is an appropriate pronouncement.
That is the law.
And for our President to make this a
big issue now, when he had control of
the House, the Senate, and the Presi-
dency and never sought to change the
law, one can believe that this is done
with intentionality to make it an issue
such that he can now claim someone
else is responsible.
But the truth is we are all respon-
sible. The truth is every one of us, my-
self included, we are all responsible for
what is happening to these babies at
the border. This President is willing to
raid every coffer in the country to
build a wall, but he is not willing to go
into those coffers to make sure that
children are treated fairly at the bor-
der.
I will close with this, my dear
friends, my dear brothers and sisters,

all of whom I love. I close with this: If
these babies and the babies that were
seen on television this morning peering
through some sort of small space were
coming from the northern border—if
these babies were coming from the
northern borders, if these were babies
coming from the northern border—
would we have the same mindset?
Would we allow this to continue with
babies?
We are all responsible, and it is time
for us to do something about this crisis
at the border—and doing something is
more than building a wall. A wall will
not solve the poverty that they are liv-
ing in in these other countries, won’t
solve the persecution that they have to
endure. A wall is not a solution to a
humanitarian crisis.
It is time for us to act on the human-
itarian crisis at the border and for this
President to lead the way on acting on
the crisis at the border.
I love my country, and I beg that we
would do something to end this crisis.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
f
OPPOSING AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANTS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON) for 5 minutes.
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I find
it ironic and hypocritical to hear my
colleagues on the other side of the aisle
who speak from this august Chamber
about the children and the families at
the border when, today, we are going to
vote on legislation that doesn’t lift a
finger to help those children and those
families. It doesn’t give a dime to our
President and make the investment in
infrastructure and healthcare and the
things that this President has asked
for repeatedly to help those children.
Instead, we hear demagoguery after
demagoguery, and it is all talk; it is no
action. And the action we need is not
amnesty for people who are in this
country illegally. What we need is real
solutions to putting the American citi-
zens first, their security and well-being
first.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposi-
tion to the legislation the Democrats
are bringing to the floor today that
will grant amnesty to millions of ille-
gal immigrants, incentivizing even
more people to come to this country il-
legally and which would do nothing to
combat the national security and hu-
manitarian crisis at the southern bor-
der that continues to grow worse every
day.
The title of the bill is the ‘‘American
Dream and Promise Act’’—the ‘‘Amer-
ican Dream and Promise Act.’’ This
may be a dream for those who get
placed in front of the line in front of
millions of people who respect our im-
migration laws; it may be a dream for
folks who get blanket immigration, a
pass and citizenship to this great coun-
try, who have committed violent acts,
criminal acts, folks who are convicted
of DUIs, gang members; but it is not
the dream of the American citizen. In
fact, it is a nightmare what is hap-
pening on the border of this country.
And it is anything but a promise. It
is a failure. It is a broken promise to
do our first job, and that is to protect
the American people, to provide for a
common defense.
From denying we have a crisis in the
first place, despite all the evidence to
the contrary, to irrationally calling
walls immoral, to repeatedly refusing
to get the President the resources he
needs to secure the border and safely
detain the children and families who
have made the dangerous trek, Demo-
crats have been derelict in their con-
stitutional duty to defend our borders
and to stop this flow of illegal immi-
grants into our country.
We have a responsibility to safeguard
our sovereignty as a nation and know
who is coming into this country.
President Reagan said: ‘‘A nation
that cannot control its borders is not a
nation.’’ Right now, we have zero oper-
ational control of our borders.
For the second straight month, Bor-
der Patrol agents apprehended more
than 100,000 people trying to cross the
border illegally, the highest number in
12 years. That is an average of 4,500
people a day. Homeland Security ex-
perts say we apprehend one out of
three. So we are talking about thou-
sands upon thousands of people that we
don’t even apprehend.
Just last week, Border Patrol agents
in El Paso encountered a thousand peo-
ple who just walked across the border.
We couldn’t do anything. We just let
them go. We don’t have the capacity.
We don’t have the resources.
Even The New York Times and Presi-
dent Obama’s Homeland Secretary Jeh
Johnson—no fans of this administra-
tion, for sure—have admitted that the
system is being pushed past the break-
ing point and that having over 4,000
people cross every day constitutes a
crisis.
The situation is so bad, the Border
Patrol agents are being forced to re-
lease folks into the interior of our
country because they have run out of
room to house everybody.
And from the great State of Texas,
my home State, where we are on the
front lines against the fight against il-
legal immigration, I can tell you that
our brave patrolmen and -women are
simply outnumbered and overwhelmed.
And yet, in the midst of this unprece-
dented border crisis, what is the solu-
tion from the Democrats? A blanket
amnesty to millions of people, to re-
ward those who come over here ille-
gally over the millions who have re-
spected our laws and waited in line to
become citizens, waiting for years to
become citizens.
To grant amnesty to illegals while
abandoning our own citizens and their
security needs is disconnected from re-
ality. It is disrespectful to our citizens,
and it is downright un-American.
Mr. Speaker, I wish today’s vote was
an isolated incident. Unfortunately, it
is the latest in a long litany of exam-
ples that exposes just how extreme the
Democratic Party has become, whether
it is advocating for open borders, al-
lowing for abortion up to point of
birth, or putting our country on the
road to ruin with failed socialist poli-
cies, and it is just another example of
Democrats showing they are more in-
terested in opposing and obstructing a
President than solving real problems.

HONORING HISPANIC SOLDIERS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. BARRAGÁN) for 5 min-
utes.
Ms. BARRAGÁN. Mr. Speaker, this
week I have the honor of travelling to
the beaches of Normandy, France,
along with a congressional delegation
to commemorate the 75th anniversary
of D-Day on the exact site where over
2,500 brave Americans were to, in the
words of Abraham Lincoln, give their
last full measure of devotion.
Several among those fallen were
some of the nearly 500,000 Latino sol-
diers who served in World War II. By
the end of that war, 17 Mexican Ameri-
cans received the Congressional Medal
of Honor, a source of great pride for the
Latino community and a legacy of
honor that has continued throughout
modern history, which now counts 60
Medals of Honor awarded to soldiers of
Hispanic heritage.
b 1015
Among the military units with His-
panic representation that participated
in the D-Day invasion was the U.S.
Army 79th Infantry Division, which
landed at Utah Beach.
The D-Day forces included men like
Nick Alvarez from California, who led a
tank crew that broke through the Ger-
man defenses that day, helping to put
the Allies on the offensive and, ulti-
mately, helped lead to the fall of Nazi
Germany.
Those D-Day forces also included Pri-
vate Andrew Ortega from Anaheim,
California, who was one of the very
first Americans to land on Omaha
Beach as part of a team of engineers
tasked with finding and neutralizing
land mines ahead of the infantrymen
taking part in the assault. Under re-
lentless fire from German guns, Pri-
vate Ortega searched for and defused
land mines no bigger than eggs. His he-
roic efforts in the face of horrific dan-
ger no doubt saved countless American
lives.
As we make ready to honor all the
troops participating in the D-Day inva-
sion, I would like to make special men-
tion of Private Louis Martin, who was
a resident of my home district in Wil-
mington, California, and who is pic-
tured here in this photo provided by his
family.
Private Martin was born in Deming,
New Mexico, in 1914, and moved to Wil-
mington as a young adult. By the time

Louis was drafted into the Army, he
was married and had a 2-year-old
daughter.
Louis was a member of the U.S.
Army 1st Infantry Division, which
landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day. It
was there, on the sands of that beach 75
years ago, that Private Martin gave his
life, for the freedom of his family, his
countrymen, and for future generations
of Americans. We, as a nation, are for-
ever indebted to him, and it gives me
great pride to have him remembered
here today.
I thank those who have served, and I
extend my deepest condolences to Pri-
vate Martin’s family and friends. I
thank Private Martin and all members
of the Armed Forces who so bravely
fought and so gallantly sacrificed their
lives in the service of our Nation dur-
ing the D-Day invasion.
It is with the greatest appreciation
for their courage, determination, and
fierce belief in this Nation, for which it
stands, that I pay tribute to these fall-
en soldiers today. It is in their honor
that I pledge to endeavor within this
body to strive ever harder to fulfill the
promise of this Nation proposed by our
Founders and paid for with the blood of
soldiers like those who fell 75 years ago
on the sands of Normandy.

ILLEGAL ALIEN AMNESTY LEADS
TO HEIGHTENED BORDER SECU-
RITY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Alabama (Mr. BROOKS) for 5 minutes.
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, as I speak, unprecedented tsunamis
of illegal aliens swamp Customs and
Border Patrol resources on America’s
porous southern border with Mexico.
What is the socialist Democrat re-
sponse to this dangerous, life-threat-
ening invasion? Today, they help make
our border security crisis worse by
pushing legislation that gives illegal
aliens amnesty that, in turn, entices
even more illegal aliens to cross our
border.
What is the result of past socialist
Democrat amnesty efforts? In the first
half of fiscal year 2019, the number of
illegal alien family units captured by
Border Patrol roughly tripled over the
previous year. Worst yet, the number
of captured illegal aliens topped 100,000
in each of March and April. Further,
the number of illegal alien caravans
has skyrocketed from two in fiscal
year 2017, to 13 in fiscal year 2018, to 104
large illegal alien caravans of 100 or
more individuals, totaling 17,242 illegal
alien captures in just the first 6
months of fiscal year 2019.
Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost re-
cently testified to the Senate that,
‘‘Our apprehension numbers are off the
charts. . . . We cannot address this cri-
sis by simply shifting more resources
or building more facilities. It is like
holding a bucket under a faucet. It
doesn’t matter how many buckets you
give me if we can’t turn off the flow.’’
Thanks to socialist Democrats’ be-
trayals of the American people, the cri-
sis is not just centered on illegal aliens
from Mexico and Central America. For
the first time ever, on May 31, Border
Patrol agents captured a large caravan
of illegal aliens from Africa, including
places like Angola, Cameroon, and
Congo. Also, on May 31, Border Patrol
agents captured the largest group of il-
legal aliens ever captured at one place:
1,036 illegal aliens at the El Paso,
Texas, border.
Let me be very clear: Illegal alien
amnesty only begets and encourages
more lawless illegal alien conduct.
Socialist Democrats’ callous dis-
regard for American citizens plagued
by illegal aliens demonstrates just how
radical socialist Democrats have be-
come. However, if you understand the
underlying reason for the socialist
Democrats’ dangerous open borders
policies, the inaction and callousness
make sense.
About 70 percent of households with
an illegal alien in them live off welfare
and on the backs of American tax-
payers. Since illegal aliens are heavily
dependent on welfare, once they get
the amnesty and the American citizen-
ship socialist Democrats desperately
seek to bestow, that makes them reli-
able socialist Democrat voters. After
all, socialist Democrats are the party
for taking much-needed money from
hardworking American taxpayers to
pay for welfare for those who prefer to
vote for a living rather than work for
one.
Quite frankly, socialist Democrats
don’t give one twit about the thou-
sands of dead Americans who die each
year because of illegal alien homicides.
Socialist Democrats care not one twit
about American blood on their hands.
Socialist Democrats covet political
power, and they see open borders, am-
nesty, and illegal aliens voting as the
way to get it.
That is why so many socialist Demo-
crat cities, like San Francisco, are
passing laws that allow illegal aliens to
register to vote, and vote, in American
elections, regardless of how badly this
denies American citizens control over
their own governments.
This insult to American voters is so
astonishing, it deserves repeating. So-
cialist Democrat cities, like San Fran-
cisco, are passing laws that allow ille-
gal aliens to register to vote, and vote,
in American elections, regardless of
how badly this denies American citi-
zens control over their own govern-
ments.
Mr. Speaker, I yearn for the day that
socialist Democrats put the interests
of American citizens above the inter-
ests of illegal aliens, above the social-
ist Democrats’ craving for political
power. Unfortunately, that day is not
today.
FEDERAL EXTREME RISK PROTEC-
TION WILL PREVENT GUN
DEATHS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH) for 5 minutes.
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, today, I
am introducing the Federal Extreme
Risk Protection Order Act of 2019.
This commonsense legislation will
empower loved ones and members of
law enforcement to prevent acts of gun
violence. When people are in crisis and
pose a threat to themselves or others,
those closest to them are often the
first to know.
Two-thirds of all gun deaths are sui-
cides. Extreme risk protection laws can
prevent these tragedies. These laws
have the power to prevent mass shoot-
ings and intimate partner gun violence.
Fifteen States and the District of Co-
lumbia currently have extreme risk
laws, and these laws have received bi-
partisan support.
It is our duty, as lawmakers, to en-
sure the safety of all Americans, and
extreme risk laws are a powerful tool
that should be available for every sin-
gle community across our Nation. This
is why we need the Federal Extreme
Risk Protection Order Act.
Nearly 100 people die every single day
in America as a result of gun violence.
Inaction is no longer an option. We
have the power, the ability, and the re-
sponsibility to change our laws to save
lives.
This legislation will empower Ameri-
cans to prevent gun deaths. I urge my
colleagues to join me in supporting
this legislation.
I am a victim of gun violence, and I
have worked many long hours, days,
months, and years working with and
talking to the victims who suffer need-
lessly from unnecessary gun violence.
It is a tragedy for this body to con-
tinue to not pass legislation that would
save lives. That is what we are brought
here to do. That is who we are. For us
to continue to turn a blind eye to the
number of people who continue to die
every single day due to unnecessary
gun violence is unconscionable.
I urge my colleagues to stand on the
right side of preserving democracy and
making sure that everyone in this Na-
tion has the ability to be able to live
here without the fear of being gunned
down. That is their right, to live in
this country with the freedom from un-
necessary gun violence.
For every day that passes by and
every tragedy that we continue to
have, when we turn a blind eye, we do
a great disservice to the American peo-
ple. On behalf of all victims, like my-
self, the victims of Virginia, and the
victims that we continue to see every
single day, if we do not stand up to pro-
tect them, then we are not standing for
democracy.

CONGRATULATING A GREAT
PUBLIC SERVANT
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Minnesota (Mr. EMMER) for 5 minutes.
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Royce Nelligan for
his 41 years of public service.
Earlier this month, Royce retired
from his position as Minnesota’s Small
Business Administration district coun-
sel after a 37-year career. Prior to Min-
nesota’s SBA, he served in the U.S. Air
Force and the National Park Service.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Royce for all of
his years of service. I thank him for
the work he did to help small busi-
nesses grow and prosper all across Min-
nesota. For all the opportunities he
helped create and promote, he left our
State and our communities better than
when he started. I congratulate him on
a job well done, and I wish him luck on
his next chapter.
CONGRATULATING ANDOVER FIRE DEPARTMENT
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the Andover Fire
Department for being awarded the 2019
Fire Department of the Year by the
Minnesota State Fire Department As-
sociation.
This award recognizes the depart-
ment’s efforts to provide outreach to
seniors in the community, to recruit
women, and for maximizing the use of
available resources.
The department’s Remember When
fire safety program brings firefighters
into Andover’s senior communities to
replace smoke alarms and mitigate any
tripping hazards that exist.
The department has made significant
strides to recruit women firefighters.
In fact, Andover is one of the few de-
partments to have a waiting list.
Mr. Speaker, I thank the women and
men of the Andover Fire Department
for keeping our community safe. Spe-
cial congratulations to Chief Jerry
Streich, Deputy Chief Mark
Winczewski, and Battalion Chief John
Wallace on earning this important rec-
ognition.
CONGRATULATING ELK RIVER MUNICIPAL
UTILITIES
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Elk River Municipal
Utilities for being a finalist for the 2019
Source Water Protection Award.
We often hear when government fails
to protect our water, but today, I want
to recognize a local utility for going
above and beyond to protect our com-
munity’s water quality.
Every year, the Minnesota Depart-
ment of Health and the Minnesota
Rural Water Association award com-
munity facilities for their work to pro-
tect community drinking water. This
year, Elk River Municipal Utilities,
also known as ERMU, of Sherburne
County, Minnesota, was chosen as a fi-
nalist because of their diligence in
prioritizing water quality.
ERMU sealed an abandoned well that
could have posed a danger to the com-
munity’s water supply. They consist-
ently examine stormwater ponds and
their effects on the treatment of drink-
ing water. They issue rebates for more
efficient fixtures.
We are proud that this Sixth District
utility is an example for our entire
State.
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Elk
River Municipal Utilities for their se-
lection, and I thank them for pro-
tecting the health and welfare of their
residents and our drinking water.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP, MICHAEL
HEMESATH
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to thank Michael Hemesath,
President of St. John’s University in
St. Cloud, Minnesota, for his commit-
ment to education and his service to
the St. John’s community.
Recently, President Hemesath an-
nounced he intends to retire at the end
of the academic year. Including his
time as a student, President Hemesath
has belonged to the St. John’s family
for 42 years.
As President, Michael Hemesath con-
tinued and built upon the College of St.
John’s reputation for developing great
talent and strong faith that is reflected
in the alumni and Johnnie tradition.
In addition, President Hemesath
leaves his alma mater with a balanced
budget, a renovated Alcuin Library,
and new buildings, like the Dietrich
Reinhart Learning Commons and the
St. John’s Bible Gallery.
Mr. Speaker, I thank President
Hemesath for all he has done for the
College of St. John’s. While he is mov-
ing on to the next chapter of his profes-
sional life, he will always be part of the
Johnnie family.

HONORING VIRGINIA BEACH
SHOOTING VICTIMS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
Virginia (Mrs. LURIA) for 5 minutes.
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today grieving for Virginia Beach, a
great city in our district, where the
year’s most devastating mass shooting
happened last Friday.
That morning, 12 innocent people left
their homes for work, but they didn’t
return home to their families, and they
never will. Eleven of them were de-
voted public servants with more than
150 years of combined experience, and
one was a dedicated contractor. I am
honored to remember them today.
Laquita C. Brown, a right-of-way
agent who lived in Chesapeake, was an
avid traveler who chronicled her trips
to New York City, Europe, and West
Africa. A friend of hers called her ‘‘Ms.
Worldwide.’’ Her 40th birthday was
coming up in November.
Ryan Keith Cox, an account clerk
who lived in Virginia Beach, had a
golden voice and sang in his church
choir. He had recently accepted his
own calling to the ministry to follow in
the footsteps of his father, a friend,
Pastor E. Ray Cox, and the pastor of
New Hope Baptist Church.
During the shooting, Keith guided
colleagues to safety, but did not join
them so he could look out for others.
Tara Welch Gallagher, an engineer
who lived in Virginia Beach, educated
the public about clean water and
served her city for 6 years. Tara’s sur-
vivors include her husband and her 22-
month-old son. Her husband told a re-
porter: ‘‘She was everything to me.’’
Mary Louise Gayle was a right-of-
way agent who lived in Virginia Beach.
A proud grandmother, she had just
turned 65, and her children planned to
take their mom to Portland later this
month to celebrate her birthday.
Alexander Mikhail Gusev, a right-of-
way agent who lived in Virginia Beach,
moved from Belarus to seek a better
life in America. He was a generous and
thoughtful person, who was said to
grab his lawnmower and cut his neigh-
bor’s lawn without even being asked.
Joshua O. Hardy was an engineering
technician who lived in Virginia Beach.
He was a loving uncle, a healthy eater
and runner, he smiled on the job, and
found time to write a beloved chil-

Richard H. Nettleton, an engineer

Katherine A. Nixon, an engineer who

cording to her neighbor, her final call
was to her husband just moments after
she was shot.
Christopher Kelly Rapp, an engineer

save others before comforting our com-

this tragedy.
As the hours and days go by, we hear
tens, if not hundreds, of stories of the
heroism of individuals who helped save
lives during this tragic event, includ-
ing the officer among the first respond-
ers who, in the performance of his du-
ties, took a bullet to protect our com-
munity, and was, by the grace of God,
saved by his protective vest.
I saw believable bravery in Sentara
Hospital where Sunday, I had the
honor of visiting a survivor of the
shooting. She clasped my hand as I
stood at her bedside, and her strength
and resolve were palpable as she had
only narrowly come away alive.
I saw love and hope at heartfelt vigils
across our community where people of
all faiths joined in prayer to remember
those who left us all too soon.
I saw strength among our city lead-
ers and police chief as they addressed
our grieving community, determined to
remember the 12 we lost far too soon.

SHOWCASE FOR COMMERCE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5
minutes.
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, last week I was honored
to attend the Showcase for Commerce
in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Cambria
County.
For nearly 30 years, the annual
Showcase for Commerce has high-
lighted the exceptional work hap-
pening in Cambria County.
Established by the late Congressman
Jack Murtha, the event brings together
Federal, State and local leaders, as
well as major defense corporations and
subcontractors and regional, national,
and international business leaders.
With more than 100 exhibitors and
more than 2,000 attendees, the Show-
case for Commerce has grown into a
nationally recognized business and in-
dustry trade show and defense con-
tracting exhibition.
Cambria County has a skilled work-
force that makes considerable con-
tributions to our national security. We
saw more than $180 million in new de-
fense contracts announced at this
year’s showcase. Because America
can’t merely remain competitive in a
global economy, but we must lead the
way with the most sophisticated tech-
nology.
As a Member of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the father of an Ac-
tive-Duty soldier and a Purple Heart
wounded warrior, I am not interested
in a fair fight. Our United States mili-
tary members deserve our best, that in-
cludes the resources to be optimally
safe, effective, and lethal.
There is no better means to a peace-
ful world or a deterrent to would-be
dictators and terrorists than a well-
equipped, robustly trained, and prop-
erly funded United States military.
Generations of workers in Cambria
County and southwestern Pennsylvania
have been dedicated to our national se-
curity through service overseas and
service here at home.
They ensure that we send our serv-
icemen and women into combat with
the most advanced state-of-the-art
equipment available.
Here in Washington, the Army’s mod-
ernization efforts include a request of
$12.2 billion in research, development,
tests, and evaluation funding, and $21.8
billion in procurement, which will
begin to address the Army’s identified
top six modernization priorities: Long-
Range Precision Fires Missile, next-
generation combat vehicles, Future
Vertical Lift, tactical network, air-
and-missile defense, and soldier
lethality.
Now, I support this request because
we need to be ready to answer the
threats that are before us, whether
they come from Iran, North Korea,
Russia, or elsewhere, we must be able
to counter and mitigate such threats
swiftly and deliberately.
Career and technical education play
a role in our readiness. Right now,
there are more than 7 million job open-
ings in the United States, and it is one
of the greatest challenges we face—the
skills gap.
Thanks to the Strengthening Career
and Technical Education for the 21st
Century Act, we were able to com-
pletely overhaul the Perkins Act and
invest the resources necessary to have
a dominant and prosperous workforce.
We can secure the future, and help
more Americans climb the rungs on the
ladder of opportunity through career
and technical education programs.
Mr. Speaker, the Showcase for Com-
merce puts Cambria County workforce
on display. Those of us in Pennsylvania
already knew this, and the showcase
lets us share it with the rest of the Na-
tion.

CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION
POLICY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Arizona (Mr. GALLEGO) for 5 minutes.
Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I yield
to the gentlewoman from Virginia
(Mrs. LURIA).
HONORING VIRGINIA BEACH SHOOTING VICTIMS
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, I continue
today in grieving for Virginia Beach
and for those that we lost.
Those who knew the victims are
making statements that we need to
hear.
Bert Snelling’s neighbor told a Vir-
ginian-Pilot reporter, ‘‘It’s the world
we live in now, and it’s a shame.’’
A friend of Missy Langer’s told The
Washington Post, ‘‘This kind of stuff
has got to stop.’’ And another friend
said, ‘‘She didn’t deserve to die like
that.’’
None of them did.
This is a moment where doing noth-
ing is no longer an option. To prove
that point, all we have to do is look at
the first responder who ran into the
building and took a bullet to protect
his fellow citizens. To him, it was
never an option to not act.
If there is a lesson that we take out
of this tragedy, all we have to do is
look at him.
We must run into the building to-
gether.
We must act.
Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, while
the Trump administration is setting
fire to our legal immigration system,
separating families, and all but closing
down our border, I am proud that
today, here in the House of Representa-
tives, Democrats are standing up and
taking action to provide legal status
and an earned path to citizenship for
young people and families that already
call this country home.
Dreamers and TPS holders are our
neighbors, coworkers, and our friends.
They are productive and contributing
members of our society, raising fami-
lies, serving in our military, and uplift-
ing our communities.
Even though they collectively rep-
resent some of the strongest parts of
this country, the Trump administra-
tion has forced them to live in con-
stant uncertainty and fear that they or
their loved ones will be deported.
But even so, they have had the cour-
age to step out of the shadows and tell
their stories and fight for the lives
they have built for themselves and
their families and for the futures they
aspire to.
They have spoken up many times,
putting themselves at risk to do so in
hopes that they would drive us to act
to uphold our American values and
allow them to become, on paper, what
they already are in their hearts: Amer-
icans.
The hundreds of thousands of Dream-
ers who came forward to register with
the government as part of the DACA
program trusted the government to
live up to its end of the bargain.
Although the Trump administration
has tried to break that promise, today
we are taking action to make sure we
keep our word.
We will not allow these aspiring
Americans to become the next victim
of Trump’s brutal deportation force.
This wasn’t an easy process, and the
fight isn’t over. It takes immense cour-
age to stand up to power at any time,
but even more so, when your life—as
you know it—is at great risk.
I have the utmost admiration and re-
spect for Dreamers who have taken a
stand and fought for the right to con-
tinue to live and work in the country
they call home. I know they will con-
tinue to fight until this bill that we
pass becomes law.
In the meantime, I—and my fellow
Democrats—will continue to be right
by their side.

Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to mourn the passing of John
David—he was known as ‘‘JD’’—Smith,
a volunteer firefighter with the Red
Lion Fire Department.
JD passed away on Sunday due to in-
juries sustained during a motorcycle
accident.
JD officially joined the Department
in June of 2016, though he was involved
in years prior as well. His sister,
Megan, said, ‘‘He was a very dedicated
firefighter. It was like his second
home. He ran just about every call he
could without hesitation. He had a
kind heart and would help anyone who
needed it. If you were sad, he was the
first to ask you what’s wrong and if
you need anything.’’
Mr. Speaker, we appreciate JD’s com-
passion and service to his community.
We recognize that those who volunteer
with our local fire companies are spe-
cial, and their dedication to the protec-
tion of others is admirable.
I ask that the community join me in
keeping JD’s family, friends, and fel-
low firefighters at the Red Lion Fire
Department in our prayers during this
difficult time.

NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, May
was National Foster Care Month, and I
would like to recognize all of the lov-
ing and caring foster parents in my dis-
trict.
Nearly 670,000 young people have fos-
ter parents across this great Nation,
and it is in a loving home that they are
able to grow and thrive. Today, I would
like to thank the foster parents, volun-
teers, family members, social workers,
child welfare professionals, and count-
less others across the district that I
represent who help them find perma-
nent homes and build strong founda-
tions.
In particular, I would also like to
recognize the work of two outstanding
nonprofit organizations in my district
that do great work in assisting foster
children and families: Bethany Chris-
tian Services and COBYS Family Serv-
ices.
This is an issue we should all care
deeply about. I was very proud that my
very first legislation to become law
was bipartisan language, cosponsored
with Representative TERRI SEWELL, to
help place foster children in the home
of family members.
When it comes to finding loving
homes for children, there are no Repub-
licans or Democrats, just mothers and
fathers, aunts and uncles, and sons and
daughters who believe that each child
should have a bed to be tucked into at
night in a loving home. Our thanks are
with those foster parents who provide
just that.
CONGRATULATING WARWICK GIRLS TRACK AND
FIELD
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to honor the State champions,
PIAA AAA Girls Track & Field cham-
pions, the Warwick Warriors. The War-
riors bested the competition last week,
bringing home the school district’s
fifth State championship. The team
took home seven medals from the
State championship games.
‘‘Every time those girls were asked
to do something, they did it,’’ said
Coach Alex Decker. ‘‘They rose to
every occasion, from the time they
were sophomores to now, and they are
just unreal.’’
Certainly, there is much to be proud
of. The lessons that these young
women have learned together will stay
with them throughout their lives.
When asked what she learned from
graduating seniors on the team, junior
Meaghan Quinn said: ‘‘No matter how
many medals or how many awards you
get as a team, it always comes back to
the people who you are and the friend-
ships that you’ve made along the way.
. . . We can’t do it without each
other.’’
Mr. Speaker, the community is proud
of the efforts of these young women.
We congratulate them on their tremen-
dous success and continue to wish
them well in the future.
f
ACKNOWLEDGING CHILD WELFARE
SYSTEM WORKERS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from
California (Ms. BASS) for 5 minutes.
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, May was Na-
tional Foster Care Month, a time for
our country to come together to ac-
knowledge the half million people in
our child welfare system, the hundreds
of thousands who work within the sys-
tem day in and day out, and the mil-
lions of adults who have exited the sys-
tem and are no longer in care.
No one knows the child welfare sys-
tem like the foster youth who have
grown up in the system. Today, the
Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth
and the National Foster Youth Insti-
tute have brought more than 100 young
people from every corner of the coun-
try here to Washington, D.C., to shad-
ow their Member of Congress. I would
like to take a second to thank the
nearly 100 Members of Congress who
are spending this morning learning
from a constituent and delegate of this
program about their personal experi-
ences and ideas to make impactful
change in the child welfare system.
The delegates of this program have
been in town since Saturday and have
been learning about community activ-
ism and successful movement building.
Yesterday, we held a forum right here
in the Capitol where our delegates were
able to ask Members of the leadership
of Congress questions about changes to
the child welfare system. I can’t wait
for the participants of this program to
be up here serving in Congress, making
their voices even louder than they are
now.
Each year, our participants have a
real hand in making change. From the
Chafee Grant extensions to the passage
of the Family First Prevention Serv-
ices Act just last year, this group’s
voices have changed our child welfare
system forever.
The reality is this: When the govern-
ment removes children from their par-
ents, the government becomes that
child’s parent. Too often, the govern-
ment forgets this commitment and life
goes on for those not in the child wel-
fare system; but for those in it, they
come to feel trapped and forgotten.
These young people here today have
traveled thousands of miles to share
their stories of their challenges with
abuse, trafficking, overmedication, or
homelessness. In addition, they are
sharing their successes with
mentorship, adoption, family reunifica-
tion, community activism, and inde-
pendent living. Their goal is to leave
Congress with a better understanding
of the reality faced day in and day out
by our Nation’s youth in care.
Today, Mr. Speaker, I would like to
share the stories of four former foster
youth who are here shadowing me
today.
Yeshi Vaughan graduated in the top
10 of her high school class. In May 2019,
she graduated with honors from Saint
Martin’s University with a bachelor’s
in social work and a minor in soci-
ology. She hopes that as a social work-
er she can share her story to encourage
other youth.
Fonda Williams is a former foster
youth from California, born and raised
in the city of Watts. She is 27 years old
and the sixth child of eight. Her cur-
rent occupation is a public safety dis-
patcher. She attended UCLA and is
currently attending El Camino College.
Racquell Perry is a Florida barred at-
torney and is the statewide outreach
for Keys to Independence at Educate
Tomorrow. The Keys to Independence
program is designed to help youth in
out-of-home care overcome barriers to
driving. Racquell is a proud two-time
graduate of Florida A&M University,
earning a bachelor’s degree in criminal
justice and a JD from its college of
law.
Toni Criner, while attending Howard
University, had the opportunity to be
an intern in my office, where she expe-
rienced child welfare and foster care
policy issues from a different view-
point. After Toni’s time on the Hill,
she went on to pioneer a White House
initiative and was given the oppor-
tunity to work with Washington, D.C.’s
most vulnerable transitioning-aged
youth. In 2019, Toni founded her own
company, T.C. Mentoring and Con-
sulting LLC. The company’s mission is
to help at-risk youth and young adults
find their path in life.
Mr. Speaker, our country is the rich-
est country in the history of the world,
and there is no excuse for us not to
take care of the half million youth who
are in the child welfare system. When
the government removes them, we are
the ones responsible, and we should
never be in a situation where anyone

would accuse the government of abuse
and neglect. This is why we need to

children in our country have every-
thing they need to be successful adults.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF JOHN
D. MILLER
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to remember
John D. Miller of Monticello, Illinois.
He was a beloved public servant and ac-
tive community member who suddenly
passed away last week.
After graduating from Monticello
High School in 1971, John served in the
United States Army and later in the
National Guard and the Army Re-
serves. It was there that he began his
career in law enforcement, serving as a
military police officer and an instruc-
tor.
His civilian service started with the
Decatur Police Department before he
was named Argenta’s chief of police. In
1995, he was appointed to the same role
with the Monticello Police Depart-
ment, where he went on to serve for 17
years until his retirement in 2012.
Throughout his tenure, he was known
for his sense of justice, but also his
sense of compassion. In total, he dedi-
cated 34 years of his life to law enforce-
ment.
In 2013, he once again answered the
call to better his community, and he
was elected as an alderman on the
Monticello City Council. In 2017, he was
reelected to a second 4-year term.
John lived his life in humble service
to his friends and neighbors. For so
many, he was a role model and a men-
tor, and he will be truly missed.
My prayers are with his wife, Karen,
his children, and his grandchildren.
CONGRATULATING COACH JIM OTT
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate
Coach Jim Ott and the men’s golf team
at Illinois Wesleyan University on
their NCAA Division III national cham-
pionship win last month for the 13th
straight year.
Illinois Wesleyan University has
made it to the national championship,
but this year, they took home the tro-
phy. When asked about the win, Coach
Ott said: ‘‘The nice thing is it was such
a team effort.’’
During the 3-day tournament, the Ti-
tans had led the scoreboard until the
final nine holes, when the second-place
team caught their lead and tied them.
Thanks to a 12-foot par putt on num-
ber 18 by junior Skylar LeVine and a
15-foot par putt on the final hole by
senior Drew Pershing, the team se-
cured their first-place ranking, earning
them the title of national champions.
Illinois Wesleyan’s win also earned
Coach Ott the Dave Williams National
Coach of the Year Award, presented by
Golf Pride Grips. He has been the men’s
golf coach for the Titans since 2000 and
led Illinois Wesleyan to eight wins in 11
tournaments this season. After coach-
ing the Titans for 19 years, he can fi-
nally boast a national championship
win.
Coach Ott has a lot to be proud of. I
congratulate him and the entire Titan
golf team.
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF TERRY TODT
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today to remember
Terry Todt. Terry was a friend and a
beloved community member who
passed away on May 23.
Many of us in central Illinois grew up
listening to Terry on the radio. For the
past 41 years, he was the man behind
the microphone announcing some of
the most memorable moments in high
school sports in central Illinois.
Terry got his first transistor radio at
the age of 7. In 1978, his dream of be-
coming a broadcaster came true when
he was hired by WSMI in Litchfield,
the radio station he had listened to on
that transistor radio while growing up.
Because of his excellence in sports
announcing, he was inducted into the
media division of the Illinois Basket-
ball Coaches Association Hall of Fame,
as well as many other distinctions.
But Terry’s love for youth sports
went far beyond his broadcasts:
For many years, he officiated basket-
ball, baseball, and soccer with the local
sports association;
He was instrumental in expanding
the Raymond Park District to add two
athletic fields, including a soccer field
that was named in his honor;
Last year, he began the T. Todt
Shootout, a basketball benefit that
raises money for the Montgomery
County Cancer Association.
Terry left a lasting legacy that will
long be remembered.
I remember meeting Terry in 1995,
and he is just one of the most genuine
people anyone could have ever met. He
was an iconic member of the Raymond
community, and he will be missed by
many.
My prayers are with his wife, Brenda,
their children, their grandchildren, and
everyone who knew my friend Terry
Todt.
f
PROTECT THE DREAMERS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes.
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to talk about our Dreamers and the
need for Congress to work together
now to protect them and provide legal
status.
Simply put, Dreamers are Americans,
just like you and I, and they should be
treated as such. They came here,
brought by their families at a very
early age: 2, 3, 4 years of age. For them,
this is the only country they have ever
known.
They are our friends, our neighbors,
and members of our churches, syna-
gogues, and mosques. They serve in the
military and attend our schools and
universities.
In my district alone, the 16th Con-
gressional District in California in the
San Joaquin Valley, there are over
1,200 Dreamers who are attending Cali-
fornia State University, Fresno; the
University of California, Merced; and
thousands more who are attending our
community colleges.
b 1100
I have heard their stories, I have
looked them in the eyes, and I have
consoled them. They have great fear.
They fear things that we would not
probably think about, like driving to
school and driving to work. They are
fearful that they might be pulled over
because maybe their vehicle has some
sort of a violation, only to be pulled
over and find out that they are not
here legally.
The jobs that they have—many of
them full-time jobs, good jobs—are
threatened by potential audits to the
employers who are seeking to deter-
mine whether or not they are here ille-
gally or not.
Yet, in spite of all of those chal-
lenges, they work tirelessly to improve
their education and to contribute to
the betterment of their families and
their local communities. They pay
taxes. They give back.
After all, isn’t that the American
way?
They are the next generation of lead-
ers in various regions throughout our
communities, yet they are living in
fear every day that they could be de-
ported. They fear for their families,
and they fear for their futures as they
wait to see if they will be removed
from the only home they have ever
known.
Can you imagine being in a house-
hold where some members of your fam-
ily are here legally, and some are not,
and the notion that your family might
be split apart, mother and father,
brothers and sisters?
How horrific that must be.
They have trusted our government to
uphold its word that we would give
them protections under the DACA pro-
gram. Now, of course, that is all under
a cloud.
We must keep our promises. Living
with this uncertainty is just not right.
It is unfair, it is unjust, and it is not
the American way.
My grandparents immigrated to this
country, and they often faced many of
the same challenges that our Dreamers
live with every day. Our story, there-
fore—a nation of immigrants past and
present—is their story. Their story,
like my family, is the American story.
It is a story of immigrants wanting to
come here to have a better life for
themselves and for their children.
So, therefore, I am unwavering in my
support that we provide them legal sta-
tus. We must let our Dreamers know
that we stand with them and that we

will not stop fighting for them. A ma-
jority of Americans want legal protec-
tion for Dreamers. Congress must lis-
ten, and Congress must act. Hopefully,
we will do that today.
So, Mr. Speaker, I stand here and say
to my colleagues: Vote ‘‘yes’’ to pass
the American Dream and Promise Act.
It is the moral and right thing to do,
and therefore we must do it now.
f
ARKANSAS FLOODING
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN) for 5 min-
utes.
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to discuss the flooding back
in my home State of Arkansas and the
need for prioritized spending and more
Federal investment in waterway infra-
structure.
While national media attention is
largely focused elsewhere, the Arkan-
sas River has swollen to historic levels,
flooding homes and businesses, breach-
ing levees, and devastating farmland.
President Trump issued an emer-
gency declaration last week allowing
FEMA to provide immediate relief to
16 counties most severely affected. This
Federal aid is extremely valuable as
communities work tirelessly to save
businesses and homes.
Arkansas is not alone in experiencing
flooding. Our neighbors in Oklahoma,
Mississippi, Louisiana, and Missouri, as
well as South Dakota, Iowa, and Kan-
sas have all been affected by flooding
this year.
These disasters beg the question:
What can Congress do to prevent future
flooding?
More specifically, how can we im-
prove infrastructure within our States
to reduce the risk of dam and levee
breaches?
As ranking member on the Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure’s Sub-
committee on Water Resources and En-
vironment, I hope to add insight into
that very question.
Waterways tend to be out of sight
and out of mind, but widespread flood-
ing has made navigable rivers impos-
sible to ignore. In Arkansas alone we
have seen an estimated $23 million in
daily economic loss along the Arkansas
River. When barges and boats can no
longer navigate inland waterways, the
entire State and surrounding areas suf-
fer.
Much of the infrastructure along
these rivers was initially installed in
the 1960s and 1970s and is now reaching
the end of its shelf life. A backlog of
maintenance projects compounds the
issues, and we can’t just keep putting
temporary patches on systemic prob-
lems.
For example, I recently cosponsored
bipartisan legislation that would
unlock billions of dollars in already
collected fees to maintain our Nation’s
Federal ports and harbors. In many
cases, we have the money for infra-
structure projects, however, red tape
and bureaucracy slow down the process
and prevent necessary work from oc-
curring.
The irony of delaying projects on our
navigable waterways is that these
projects often have tremendous eco-
nomic returns—as high as 10 to 1 and 16
to 1. It makes economic sense and it is
common sense to invest in waterways
and infrastructure.
Unprecedented flooding such as we
are observing should serve as a chance
for us to reexamine infrastructure to
ensure it is updated and capable of pro-
tecting life and property.
No doubt, as flood waters recede in
the coming days, Congress’ attention
will turn elsewhere. But I urge my col-
leagues in both the House and the Sen-
ate to come together, address long-
term projects that have been on the
back burner for years, and keep WRDA
on its 2-year schedule.
We can’t control the weather, but we
can and should do better than accept-
ing as the norm to have outdated and
failing infrastructure, flooded homes,
and washed out farmlands. The Amer-
ican people deserve better than this.
Before I close, I would be remiss if I
didn’t acknowledge and thank the
countless first responders and volun-
teers who have worked around the
clock to fill sandbags, move livestock
to higher ground, transport possessions
from homes at risk of flooding, and res-
cue people trapped in moving flood-
waters.
Governor Hutchinson, the Arkansas
Department of Emergency Manage-
ment, the Arkansas National Guard,
the Corps of Engineers, and many other
State and local officials have led an ef-
ficient and organized response, and
their swift action has certainly saved
lives and property.
Arkansas doesn’t back down when
challenged, and we persevere through
the storms of life. I have heard so
many stories of Arkansans rallying
around one another in their time of
need, and this gives me hope for the
days ahead.

PRAYER
Rabbi Lawrence R. Sernovitz,
Nafshenu, Cherry Hill, New Jersey, of-
fered the following prayer:
Dear God, benevolent, compas-
sionate, and gracious; abundant in lov-
ing kindness and truth; forgiving iniq-
uity, rebellion, and sin, be with us as
we open this session of the United
States House of Representatives. Guide
these courageous individuals to create
holy space where healthy debate is en-
couraged, and the dignity and auton-
omy of human beings is respected and
loved.
Dear God, let us remember that the
world is not complete. We are com-
pleting it. In our brokenness, give us
hope. Let us build the world with love.
May the angels around us open our
hearts, lift our spirits, and give us the
ability to see ourselves in the other. As
our tradition teaches, love the stranger
as yourself.
Dear God, bless these Representa-
tives with enough foolishness to be-
lieve that they can make a difference
in this world, that they can do what
others claim cannot be done, bringing
justice and kindness to our Earth, to
our children, and to humanity. The
whole world is a narrow bridge. The es-
sence is not to be afraid.
And we say together, amen.

close friend, Rabbi Larry Sernovitz,
whom we have just heard offer us a
beautiful, wise prayer.
I first met Rabbi Sernovitz in Abing-
ton, in my home district, where he
served Temple-Beth Am. When I was
first elected to public office as a town-
ship commissioner, it was Larry, it was
the rabbi, who offered a powerful bene-
diction that evening on the importance
of education, social justice, humility,
and courage. Larry has been a close
friend and counselor ever since.
Through Larry’s rabbinical work, he
has lifted his devotion to community,
faith, and family. Larry lives the creed,
‘‘Love the stranger.’’
As a founder of Nafshenu in Cherry
Hill, New Jersey, he seeks to create a
community that places people and
their hopes and their dreams first.
Most importantly, Larry is a dedi-
cated husband to Rebecca and a loving,
steady dad to Sam, Daniella, and Eden,
who join him today.
It brings me great joy to welcome my
good friend Rabbi Larry Sernovitz and
thank him for his wise prayer.

RECOGNIZING PRIDE MONTH
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam
Speaker, June is Pride Month, marking
50 years since the uprising at the
Stonewall in New York City to protest
discrimination against LGBT Ameri-
cans.
The month is marked by celebrations
in communities all over the country.
Last week, in western New York, we
raised the pride flags in both Buffalo
and Niagara Falls.
The House this year passed the his-
toric Equality Act to extend the legal
protections of Federal civil rights laws
to LGBT Americans, prohibiting dis-
crimination in housing, employment,
and medical treatment.
Passing the Equality Act into law
couldn’t be more urgent. This adminis-
tration has taken steps to roll back
rules across Federal agencies, revers-
ing years of progress and invoking
fears in communities throughout this
Nation.
As a member of the Equality Caucus,
I am proud to recognize Pride Month. I
am committed to fighting these dis-
criminatory actions and will keep
working toward full equality for each
and every American.
f
HONORING JEREMY COLLIER
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, today, I have Jeremy
Collier with me as part of the National
Foster Youth Institute Shadow Day.
Jeremy and his wife, Ashley, live in
Cincinnati with their 2-year-old son,
Payton. Jeremy recently completed his
MBA studies at Western Governors
University.
Life wasn’t always easy for Jeremy.
Jeremy aged out of the foster care sys-
tem at age 18 when he was still in high
school. Jeremy was virtually homeless,
yet he graduated and went on to com-
plete a bachelor’s degree from the Uni-
versity of Cincinnati. Jeremy majored
in business with a concentration in fi-
nance.
Today, Jeremy works as a senior in-
surance auditor, focusing on risk-re-
lated audits. I thank Jeremy for being
here today, sharing his story and help-
ing so many children overcome similar
obstacles.
Jeremy went through tough times
and persevered. He came to Washington
to share his experiences in the hope of
strengthening the system for foster
youth.
Madam Speaker, I wholeheartedly
congratulate Jeremy on all that he has
achieved in life. Madam Speaker, I am
proud of Jeremy’s success and wish
him and his family the best moving
forward.
f
CONGRESS MUST STAND FIRMLY
BEHIND DREAMERS
(Mr. CARBAJAL asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in support of H.R. 6, the
American Dream and Promise Act of
2019.
This Nation was founded by immi-
grants who believed that if you work
hard and play by the rules, you can
achieve the American Dream.
When the Trump administration an-
nounced its heartless decision to re-
scind DACA protections, it turned its
back on the core beliefs of our country
and put over 800,000 young immigrants
who know America as their only home
in a state of fear.
Dreamers are hardworking and law-
abiding Americans. They are our mili-
tary servicemen and -women, our
neighbors, and our children’s class-
mates. They make our country a better
place for all.
After years of tireless advocacy and
living in distress, Dreamers and TPS
recipients deserve clarity. I am proud
to support H.R. 6, which will offer them
an earned pathway to citizenship. Now
more than ever, we must stand firmly
behind our Dreamers and acknowledge
their countless social, economic, and
cultural contributions to the United
States.
Please know that I will not stop
fighting for all young immigrants and
Dreamers. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the passage of H.R. 6 this week.
HONORING BEDFORD, VIRGINIA,
SOLDIERS
(Mr. RIGGLEMAN asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to honor the sacrifice made
by our brave men in uniform on the
shores of France 75 years ago this
week.
As the dawn hours rose on June 6,
1944, the choppy waters of the English
Channel were filled with American and
Allied soldiers. Thirty of those brave
men were from the town of Bedford,
Virginia, a small hamlet nestled in the
southern part of my district. These
boys, who competed for the honor of
being the first to reach Omaha Beach,
etched their hometown into history as
one with the highest per capita loss of
life.
By the end of that fateful day, when
the sun had set on Omaha Beach, 19
Bedford soldiers were dead. Four more
died in the Normandy campaign. Every
one of them was a hero.
Seventy-five years have passed, and
yet, their heroism stands the test of
time.
f
ADDRESSING THE EPIDEMIC OF
GUN VIOLENCE
(Mr. DELGADO asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. DELGADO. Madam Speaker, I
rise today because we must listen to
our children. Our children are calling
out for us to take action to address the
epidemic of gun violence, which has
spread to traditionally safe places like
schools, concert halls, movie theaters,
and places of worship.
Our children are growing up under
the constant paranoia of gun violence.
Try, if you can, to imagine the depth of
their fear and anxiety. Nowhere is safe.
Last week, I visited seven schools in
my district and spoke with students
who fear for their safety and stress
over our inability to take action on
gun violence.
We are not even halfway through
2019, and there have already been 13
school shootings. Is there any mystery
behind the student walkouts we experi-
enced last year in response to gun vio-
lence?
I was proud to support H.R. 8, back in
March, in order to achieve long-over-
due universal background checks, a
baseline measure to address gun vio-
lence.
Now the Senate must act. I implore
my colleagues in the Senate to hear
the young people of our country calling
for change and to pass H.R. 8. The time
is now.

minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, we
mark the beginning of Gun Violence
Awareness Month clouded in tragedy
and heartbreak as our Nation yet again
mourns the loss of innocent life and
confronts another act of senseless gun
violence.
As a Nation, we grieve with the Vir-
ginia Beach community. We must now
ask ourselves how many more lives will
be allowed to be lost before we finally
say enough is enough? How many chil-
dren, how many neighbors, how many
colleagues and friends must we lose be-
fore we finally take action to make
commonsense gun reform a reality?
‘‘Run, hide, and fight’’ should no
longer be a phrase our children must
learn along with their ABCs. Each day
that passes without universal back-
ground checks, without a ban on mili-
tary-style assault weapons, without
safe storage and red flag laws, we risk
the loss of more innocent life.
This Gun Violence Awareness Month
should serve as a wake-up call to all
Americans. What are we waiting for?
The time to act is now.
f
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH: ACT NOW TO
STOP GUN VIOLENCE
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
his remarks.)
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker,
June is Gun Violence Awareness
Month, a time for extra reflection on
the immeasurable cost of lives lost and
destroyed in senseless shootings. And
it is another chance to demand that
Congress act to stop the bloodshed.
Once more, last Friday, a gunman at-
tacked a local government building in
Virginia Beach, killing 12 and wound-
ing many more.
This was the 150th mass shooting in
America since the start of the year, on
the 151st day of the year. Let that sink
in: 150 days, 151 mass shootings.
Enough is enough.
But it is not just mass shootings.
This past weekend, in Chicago alone, at
least 52 people were shot, and eight
people died. Enough is enough.
It is long past time for the Congress
to take concrete action to reduce gun
violence. As a House, we did that this
year, passing H.R. 8, a bipartisan uni-
versal background check bill, but it
has been more than 100 days since we
sent that legislation to the Senate and,
still, no vote.
How many more shootings, how
many more lives lost, before Leader
MCCONNELL ends the obstruction and
allows a vote on this commonsense
bill? Congress is not powerless. Con-
gress has the ability to save lives. Let’s
act now.

IN MEMORY OF THE VICTIMS OF
THE VIRGINIA BEACH MASS
SHOOTING
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, Mr.
LaQuita Brown, Ryan Keith Cox, Tara
Welch Gallagher, Mary Louise Gayle,
Alexander Mikhail Gusev, Joshua O.
Hardy, Michelle ‘‘Missy’’ Langer, Rich-
ard H. Nettleton, Katherine A. Nixon,
Christopher Kelly Rapp, Robert Wil-
liams, Herbert Snelling—these are the
victims of Friday’s mass shooting in
Virginia Beach.
That phrase, ‘‘Friday’s mass shoot-
ing,’’ should sound bizarre, but it
doesn’t. This year is averaging more
than one mass shooting per day in our
country.
How long would it take to read all of
the victim’s names?
How long would it take to process
the grief, to wrap our hearts around
the scale of this tragedy?
And how long will it take for our
leaders to act?
This year, the House passed legisla-
tion to require universal background
checks and to close the Charleston
loophole, but these measures have gone
to the graveyard of bills that the Sen-
ate has created.
Each of these reforms will save lives;
none of them threatens our Second
Amendment rights.
I will close with the words of John
Donne: Do not ask ‘‘for whom the bell
tolls; it tolls for thee.’’
f
EXTEND A WELCOME MAT TO THE
DREAMERS
(Ms. TITUS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. TITUS. Madam Speaker, I rise
today on behalf of over 15,000 Dreamers
and TPS holders who live in the heart
of Las Vegas. They ask for nothing
more than a shot at the American
Dream.
They are teachers, nurses, entre-
preneurs, and, more importantly, they
are our neighbors, our friends, our col-
leagues.
These courageous individuals con-
tribute so much to our communities
where they have spent most of their
lives and they call home. They have
made the United States their own
country and their own home.
Yet, over the last 2 years, the Trump
administration has attacked Dreamers
and TPS holders by rolling back immi-
gration protections and tearing fami-
lies apart.
That has got to stop.
By passing the American Dream and
Promise Act, this House is going to be
standing up to the hateful anti-immi-
gration policies that have come to de-
fine the Trump administration.
The symbol of the United States
must always remain the Statue of Lib-
erty. We should be putting out a wel-
coming mat, not building a wall.
f
PROTECTIONS FROM TERRORIST
THREATS ON SOCIAL MEDIA
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute.)
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam
Speaker, I rise today because not near-
ly enough is being done by our social
media companies to take down ter-
rorist content from their platforms.
It has been months now since the
Christchurch massacre which was
streamed on Facebook because its arti-
ficial intelligence, or IA, was not able
to or capable of taking it down quickly
enough. Now that video has been
uploaded and re-uploaded hundreds of
thousands of times.
In fact, instead of preventing ter-
rorist content from spreading on their
platform, as reported by the Associated
Press, recently, Facebook has been
making videos and promoting terrorist
content on its own system.
For instance, an al-Qaida-linked ter-
rorist group has an auto-generated
Facebook that has nearly 4,500 likes.
The case was profiled in the AP story
and served as yet another glaring ex-
ample of Facebook’s inability to police
itself.
But what is even more striking, is
that before coming to speak on the
House floor today, I checked, and this
profile is still up there. This profile
that the AP reported to Facebook is
still up there. Facebook does not care
right now about our own safety. They
are putting their own profit before the
safety or national security of this very
country.
Madam Speaker, I push for aggres-
sive action here. We need a strong pub-
lic-private partnership, and Facebook
has got to come to its senses today. It
is so important.

REMEMBERING THE VICTIMS OF
THE VIOLENT SUPPRESSION OF
DEMOCRACY PROTESTS IN
TIANANMEN SQUARE AND ELSE-
WHERE IN CHINA
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker,
I move to suspend the rules and agree
to the resolution (H. Res. 393) remem-
bering the victims of the violent sup-
pression of democracy protests in
Tiananmen Square and elsewhere in
China on June 3 and 4, 1989, and calling
on the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China to respect the univer-
sally recognized human rights of all
people living in China and around the
World, as amended.
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion.
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 393
Whereas, on June 4, 1989, a violent crack-
down on peaceful demonstrations held in and
around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square was car-
ried out by the People’s Liberation Army,
following orders given by the Government of
the People’s Republic of China;
Whereas an estimated 1,000,000 people
joined the protests in Tiananmen Square and
citizens in over 400 Chinese cities staged
similar protests calling for democratic re-
form, including not only students, but also
government employees, journalists, workers,
police officers, members of the armed forces,
and other citizens;
Whereas the peaceful demonstrations of
1989 called upon the Government of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China to eliminate corrup-
tion, accelerate economic and political re-
form, and protect human rights, particularly
the freedoms of expression and assembly,
issues that remain relevant in United States-
China relations 30 years later;
Whereas the Government of the People’s
Republic of China takes active measures to
deny its citizens the truth about the
Tiananmen Square massacre, including the
blocking of uncensored internet sites and so-
cial media commentary on microblog and
other messaging services, and the placement
of misleading information on the events of
June 3 and 4, 1989, on internet sites available
in China;
Whereas, on May 20, 1989, martial law was
declared in Beijing, China, after authorities
had failed to persuade demonstrators to
leave Tiananmen Square;
Whereas during the late afternoon and
early evening hours of June 3, 1989, thou-
sands of armed troops, supported by tanks
and other armor, moved into Beijing and sur-
rounding streets;
Whereas, on the night of June 3, 1989, and
continuing into the morning of June 4, 1989,
soldiers fired into crowds, inflicting high
casualties on the demonstrators and injuring
many unarmed civilians;
Whereas tanks crushed to death some pro-
testers and onlookers and seriously injured
many others;
Whereas independent observers reported
that hundreds, perhaps thousands, were
killed and wounded by People’s Liberation
Army soldiers and other security forces in
Beijing and other cities in China;
Whereas tens of thousands were detained
and sent to prison or reeducation through
labor, often without trial and many were
tortured and imprisoned for decades;
Whereas the Tiananmen Mothers is a group
of relatives and friends of those killed in
June 1989 whose demands include the right
to mourn victims publicly and who call for a
full, public, and independent accounting of
the wounded, dead, and those imprisoned for
participating in the spring 1989 demonstra-
tions;
Whereas members of the Tiananmen Moth-
ers group have faced arrest, harassment, and
discrimination, with the group’s website
blocked in China and the freezing by Chinese
authorities of international cash donations
made to the group to support families of vic-
tims;
Whereas despite the Government of the
People’s Republic of China’s integration into
the international economic system and its
obligations under international treaties and
covenants, the political reforms and the pro-
tection of universally recognized rights
sought by the Tiananmen demonstrators
have not been realized during the past 30
years;
Whereas the Government of the People’s
Republic of China continues to actively sup-
press universally recognized rights by im-
prisoning or restricting the activities of pro-
democracy activists, human rights lawyers,
citizen journalists, labor union leaders, reli-
gious believers, members of ethnic minori-
ties, and individuals in the Xinjiang and Ti-
betan regions, among many others who seek
to express their political or religious views
or their ethnic identity in a peaceful man-
ner, including in Hong Kong where the Gov-
ernment of the People’s Republic of China
has increasingly exerted influence, eroding
freedoms there, and placing its special status
at risk;
Whereas the Government of the People’s
Republic of China continues to harass, dis-
appear, and detain peaceful advocates for
human rights, religious freedom, ethnic mi-
nority rights and the rule of law, and their
family members, such as Ilham Tohti, Gao
Zhisheng, Wang Bingzhang, Lobsang Tsering,
Yang Maodong (also known as Guo
Feixiong), Liu Xianbin, Qin Yongmin, Wu
Gan, Zhang Haitao, Wang Quanzhang, Tashi
Wangchug, Tang Jingling, Liu Feiyue, Wang
Yi, Jiang Rong, Cao Yuguang, Abdurehim
Heyit, Eziz Emet, Hebibulla Tohti, Drugdra,
Lobsang Gephel, Sonam Dargye, Thardoe
Gyaltsen, Gulmira Imin, and Huang Qi,
among many others;
Whereas according to the Political Pris-
oner Database maintained by the United
States Congressional-Executive Commission
on China, the Government of the People’s
Republic of China continues to detain over
1,500 political and religious prisoners, though
the number is presumed to be much higher;
Whereas Nobel Peace Prize laureate and
prominent advocate for human rights and
political reform Liu Xiaobo died in state cus-
tody in 2017, the first Nobel Peace Prize lau-
reate to die in state custody since Carl Von
Ossietzky died in 1938 after being detained by
the Nazi German government;
Whereas over a million Uyghurs, Kazakhs,
and other ethnic and religious minorities are
interned in political reeducation camps in
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and
elsewhere in China and are subjected to the
forced renunciation of faith, torture, and
forced assimilation of their language and
culture through actions that may constitute
crimes against humanity;
Whereas the Government of the People’s
Republic of China harasses, detains, and tor-
tures human rights lawyers who take on
cases deemed politically sensitive; prevents
Chinese workers from forming independent
unions and engages in an ongoing crackdown
on labor advocates, organizations, and their
supporters; restricts severely the religious
activity of Protestants, Catholics, Tibetan
Buddhists, and Turkic Muslims and has
sought to eradicate Falun Gong practice in
China; vilifies publicly and refuses to nego-
tiate with His Holiness the Dalai Lama or
his representatives over Tibetan issues and
asserts control over the reincarnation proc-
ess through which the next Dalai Lama will
be recognized; repatriates forcibly refugees
to North Korea and pressures neighboring
governments to repatriate refugees from
China who reach their territory in con-
travention of the international legal prin-
ciple of non-refoulement; restricts the ac-
tivities of and detains citizen journalists;
and continues to limit the size of Chinese
families;
Whereas the protection of universally rec-
ognized human rights, in law and practice,
would allow the Government of the People’s
Republic of China to establish more stable
economic, political, and security relations
with its neighbors and the United States;
and
Whereas this historical episode has had an
enduring impact on United States-China re-
lations—
(1) because there has been no justice for
those who lost their lives seeking freedom
and political reform during the Spring of
1989;
(2) because the Government of the People’s
Republic of China censors research, discus-
sion and commemoration of Tiananmen in
China;
(3) because the demonstrations showed
that the ideas of democracy and freedom,

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker,
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res.
393.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey?
There was no objection.
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker,
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. PELOSI), the
Speaker of the House.
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding, and
I thank him for his lifelong commit-
ment to promoting human rights
throughout the world. I thank him,
also, for his leadership in bringing this
legislation to the floor today.
Madam Speaker, I also thank Mr.
MCCAUL, Mr. ENGEL, and Mr. MCGOV-
ERN for their leadership, and CHRIS
SMITH, who has been working on this
issue for decades.
Madam Speaker, I rise in remem-
brance of the horror perpetrated by the
Chinese Government 30 years ago today
and of the heroism of those who died
demanding human rights and human
dignity.
Again, I salute Chairman MCGOVERN,
Chairman ENGEL, CHRIS SMITH, Mr.
MCCAUL, Mr. MALINOWSKI, and so many
others for bringing this resolution for-
ward, which ensures that we do not
merely remember that dark chapter of
history, but that we record it in the of-
ficial proceedings of the United States
Congress.
Madam Speaker, 30 years ago, 1 mil-
lion students, workers and citizens—
men and women full of passion, ideal-
ism, and courage—peacefully marched
for a better future.
They raised their Goddess of Democ-
racy in the image of our own Statue of
Liberty. They quoted our Founders.
They dared to dream of the democracy
we cherish here in the United States—
not necessarily the same kind of de-
mocracy, but for democratic freedoms.
They stood up for freedom, only to be
cut down by a hail of bullets and a line
of tanks.
Earlier this year, the Tiananmen
Mothers, who lost loved ones in the
massacre, wrote to the Chinese leaders.
Those mothers said: ‘‘30 years later,
while the criminal evidence has been
covered up . . . the hard facts of the
massacre are etched into history.
‘‘No one can erase it; no power, how-
ever mighty, can alter it; and no words
or tongues, however clever, can deny
it.’’
Today, and on all days, we reassure
these mothers that we remember and
that the heroism of their children will
continue to be etched in our history.
It falls on us to remember, because
China still, shamefully, tries to hide
and deny these heroes’ legacy.
As the writer Lu Xun wrote: ‘‘Lies
written in ink cannot disguise by facts
written in blood.’’
The memory and the spirit of the
Tiananmen protestors live on in the
hearts of all those who strive for free-
dom in China today:
In the hearts of the Uighur commu-
nities facing unabated abuse and re-
pression at the hands of the Chinese
Government;
In the hearts of the people living in
Hong Kong, where China continues to
make a mockery of the ‘‘one country,
two systems’’ pledge;
In the hearts of the Tibetan people,
who, for decades, have faced a brutal
campaign to erase their religion, their
culture, and their language; and
In the hearts of journalists, human
rights lawyers, Christians, and democ-
racy activists unjustly imprisoned.
They always say—speaking of those
in prison—that one great form of tor-
ture of the Chinese officials is to tell
the prisoners that no one remembers
them, nobody knows why they are
there, they are forgotten.
Well, we are here in the House of
Representatives today to tell those
prisoners they are not forgotten: We
know many of their names; we convey
them to Chinese officials every chance
we get; and we carry them in our
hearts.
As Liu Xiaobo wrote in his final
statement, ‘‘I Have No Enemies’’:
‘‘Freedom of expression is the founda-
tion of human rights, the source of hu-
manity and the mother of truth.’’
As we support those fighting for free-
dom from China’s oppression, we do so
in the name of human rights, human-
ity, and truth.
If we do not speak out for human
rights in China because of economic
concerns, then we lose all moral au-
thority to talk about human rights in
any other place in the world.
In their March letter, the Tiananmen
Mothers also quoted the Holocaust sur-
vivor and Nobel Peace laureate Elie
Wiesel, who once said: ‘‘If we forget the
dead, the dead will be killed a second
time.’’
With this resolution, the Congress
pledges to the Tiananmen generation
that we will never forget. With the
spirit of the Tiananmen protestors in
our hearts, we pledge to continue to
work toward our shared dream, a
dream of the day when the world’s
most populous nation can be called the
largest democracy.
And, again, China is a very impor-
tant country. The U.S.-China relation-
ship is a very important relationship.
At the time when this oppression took
place, China was abusing not only the
rights of their own people; they were
not allowing U.S. products into China.
They were abusing our trade relation-
ship, and they were selling tech-
nologies of mass destruction and mis-
sile delivery systems to rogue coun-
tries.
We thought at the time if we high-
lighted what happened at Tiananmen
Square, where the trade deficit at the
time was $5 billion a year—it was $5
billion a year, Chairman MCCAUL—we
thought that gave us great leverage to
free the prisoners, open their markets
to our products, stop their violations of
our intellectual property rights, as
well as stop their transfer of tech-
nologies that were unsafe—$5 billion.
With corporate America, who hoped
to benefit from the trade relationship—
not your everyday small- to moderate-
sized businesses. They knew the abuse
of China and the trade relationship.
But corporate America weighed in with
Democratic and Republican Presidents
and said: We cannot use that trade re-
lationship, that $5 billion as leverage
to free the prisoners and make other
changes. If we just proceed as we do,
everything will work out.
Well, now the trade deficit with
China isn’t $5 billion a year. It is more
than $5 billion a week—a week. We
rode the dragon, and the dragon will
decide when we get off.
But as a tribute to corporate Amer-
ica, our policy was to ignore the viola-
tions, whether it was trade violations,
human rights violations, or violations
of trading missiles and other tech-
nologies to rogue countries—and now
over $5 billion a week. It was a serious,
serious mistake.
b 1230
But as we made that mistake, we
also betrayed our values, our values of
respecting the dignity and worth of
every person and respecting their aspi-
rations for freedom of expression, free-
dom of religion, and freedom of belief
in this great country of China.
So with respect to our prospects for
our relationship with China, I would
hope that in our trade talks with them
now, that we are also bringing up the
important subject of our values as well
as the dollars that are involved in the
relationship.
Again, I salute those who have been
so important in this discussion. I called

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4233
June 4, 2019
Mr. MCGOVERN our spiritual leader as
we traveled to China and within China,
to Tibet, and Hong Kong, and the rest,
for his incredible leadership as not only
the chair of the United States-China
Economic and Security Review Com-
mission, but the chair of the Tom Lan-
tos Human Rights Commission.
Madam Speaker, I urge our col-
leagues to give this a big strong vote.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I would like to asso-
ciate myself with Speaker PELOSI’s
comments, that we have been riding
the dragon for too long.
Thirty years ago today, the so-called
People’s Liberation Army turned their
guns on the people of China, killing
hundreds and possibly thousands of un-
armed civilians in Beijing. Many were
Chinese students, who had been peace-
fully protesting for reform, democratic
transparency, and respect for funda-
mental human rights.
The victims included young children
and people in their 60s, cut down by in-
discriminate gunfire. The dramatic
days of May and June 1989, left the
world with many indelible images: the
huge expanse of Tiananmen Square
packed with hundreds of thousands of
people rallying for freedom; the 30-foot
tall Goddess of Democracy statue built
by Beijing art students in the center of
the square; the rush of tanks and ar-
mored personnel carriers into the area
to, quite literally, crush the protest
and protesters on June 4; the heroism
the next day of someone the world only
knows as Tank Man who halted an en-
tire column of Chinese Army tanks,
armed only with shopping bags and re-
solve.
But those indelible images are hidden
from the people of China by the Com-
munist regime that inherited the
bloody mantle of Tiananmen. Hiding
behind the great fire wall, the Chinese
Government refuses to allow any reck-
oning with that history, and fiercely
quashes discussion, whether online or
in public.
Obsessed with control, it uses its
massive Orwellian apparatus to try to
erase the events of June 1989 from the
memory of the world. But as John
Adams once wrote: ‘‘Facts are stubborn
things,’’ so, too, are the memories of
the many Chinese who experienced
those events up close. Western journal-
ists on the ground during the massacre
reported that people in the streets of
Beijing pleaded with them to tell the
world what had happened there.
Today’s resolution is a continuation
of that sacred charge. So I want to
thank all of the bipartisan authors of
H. Res. 393, and Mr. MCGOVERN and Mr.
SMITH, for giving this House a renewed
opportunity to testify to the true
events of June 1989, to tell and call for
a just and open accounting for the
Tiananmen massacre, and to condemn
serious, ongoing human rights viola-
tions by the Government of China.
Dictators need to understand that
freedom can only be held back for a fi-
nite period of time. They may succeed
in crushing a democratic protest, but
they will always fail to crush the
democratic spirit.
So I am proud to stand with the peo-
ple of China who want to break the
chains of Communist oppression, and I
urge support for this resolution.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman
MCCAUL for his eloquent statement and
his leadership on this issue, and I rise
in very strong support of this measure.
Thirty years ago, I was here on Cap-
itol Hill, my first job out of college. I
was working on the Senate side for the
late, great Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, and one day, I was sitting in
my cubicle and we were watching our
TVs, which were tuned to this novelty
station called CNN that was bringing
these events live to us, something we
had never really experienced before.
One day we looked up, and we saw
the image of this young Chinese man
with his grocery bags standing in front
of that line of tanks, and we watched it
unfold for about 2 minutes. It seemed
like forever. We did not know what
would happen. Would he be killed?
Would he be run over? It was a moment
that changed my life and changed the
world.
We all know what happened after-
wards: a massacre; mass arrests; efforts
that continue to this day to bury the
truth of what happened in Tiananmen
Square.
The Chinese Government has tried to
erase the memory of that day from our
collective memory. Here is something
very important, something that should
command our attention: the Chinese
Government today is not satisfied
merely with censoring its own people.
It is insisting on censoring the entire
world.
It is trying to intimidate companies,
and universities, and individuals all
around the world into never uttering
the words, ‘‘the Tiananmen massacre.’’
With this resolution, we say to the
Chinese Government that they cannot
intimidate the United States of Amer-
ica. This resolution makes clear we are
going to speak the truth about the
crime that they have committed 30
years ago, and all of the crimes they
continue to commit today: the whole-
sale imprisonment of lawyers; their ef-
forts to crush the culture and heritage
of the Tibetan people; the mass surveil-
lance technology they are exporting to
the whole world; and the mass intern-
ment of innocent men, women, and
children in Xinjiang.
We see the significance of these ac-
tions, not just what the Chinese Gov-
ernment is doing on human rights, but
what is being done on trade, and in the
South China Sea. All of them are an ef-
fort by the Chinese Government to
break free and to rewrite the rules that
keep the world safe and free.
We see the Chinese Government’s at-
tempts to silence us on these issues for
what it is, a sign of weakness, not of
strength.
The Chinese Government’s power
rests on a fragile foundation of false-
hood. It depends on people forgetting
the past. It depends on people believing
a lie. So today, we say that they are
failing, and they are going to fail. It
has been 30 years. We still mark this
anniversary. We still remember Liu
Xiaobo and all of the heroes of the
square. The footage of Tank Man still
plays on TV, and thanks to the inter-
net, more people are seeing it today
than saw it in 1989.
We will carry on until we know his
name, until the Chinese people have
the freedom that they fought peace-
fully for that day and that they so
richly deserve.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I
yield such time as he may consume to
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
PERRY), a member of the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee.
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I
thank the ranking member for yield-
ing.
Madam Speaker, today I am in sup-
port of this resolution on the 30th anni-
versary of the Tiananmen Square mas-
sacre, and I thank Representative
MCGOVERN and Representative SMITH
for their leadership on this resolution,
which serves to remember the victims
of the violence and suppression of de-
mocracy protest in Tiananmen Square
in 1989, and calls on the current Com-
munist Government of China to respect
the universally recognized human
rights of all people living in China and
around the world.
I just remember as a young man
watching this—as probably many of
the people do—whole thing unfold on
our television sets. We were rooting for
these people yearning to be free, and
the man standing in front of the tank.
It is just emblazoned in our minds.
Thirty years ago in the spring of 1989,
thousands of Chinese students began
staging peaceful protests for demo-
cratic reforms in China. They were
asking their Communist government
for rights that are fundamental to any
democracy, including: freedom of ex-
pression, freedom of assembly, and the
elimination of official corruption.
They were asking for rights and free-
doms that we enjoy in the United
States, but the Chinese citizens were
being denied then, and believe it or
not, are still being denied today. Re-
gardless of what we see on television,
regardless of what we might think be-
cause it says, ‘‘made in China,’’ things
are different in China.
When faced with the growing and in-
tensifying peaceful protests, the Com-
munist leaders in 1989 chose a violent
and authoritarian response, and then
lied about it and acted like it didn’t
happen. They chose to declare martial

law and to intensify their use of au-
thoritarian tactics to oppress and con-
trol the people of China, culminating
in the events in Tiananmen Square.
On June 4, 10,000 to 15,000 soldiers in
armored columns of tanks outside
Tiananmen Square fired directly at
Chinese citizens and indiscriminately
at crowds in Beijing, inflicting high ci-
vilian casualties. These were unarmed
crowds, Madam Speaker, fired upon.
To this day, we still don’t know how
many civilians were killed that day.
Estimates range from hundreds to a
few thousand and we can say with con-
fidence that thousands more civilians
were wounded on June 4 and even a
greater number were arrested for tak-
ing part in these protests.
We are here today to honor those who
were lost and affected by the violent,
authoritarian suppression of the Chi-
nese Communist Government in 1989,
and to call for an end to China’s cur-
rent, continued authoritarian suppres-
sion.
Unfortunately, parallels can be
drawn between the Chinese Govern-
ment that perpetrated the Tiananmen
Square massacre and the current re-
gime of President Xi and the Com-
munist Party. In China today, there is
official government repression of free-
dom of speech, religion, movement, as-
sociation, and assembly.
We know at least 1 million, and some
estimate up to 3 million Chinese Mus-
lims are forcibly interned in detention
camps designed to erase their religious
and ethnic identities. This is some-
thing out of the 1930s and the 1940s that
the world said would never happen
again. It is happening right now.
The Communist government has de-
ployed tens of millions of evasive high-
tech surveillance cameras throughout
the country to monitor the general
public. The cameras and other forms of
surveillance are used to intimidate po-
litical dissidents, religious leaders and
adherents, and minority groups.
In the Tibet Autonomous Region and
other Tibetan areas, the Communist
government has installed surveillance
cameras in monasteries. Tibetans also
face the monitoring and disruption of
telephone and internet communica-
tions.
And this is absolutely just the begin-
ning with the establishment of the sys-
tem of social credits.
The State Department’s 2018 Report
on Human Rights Practices in China
has a long list of human rights abuses
by the Chinese Communist Govern-
ment, to include: Unlawful killings by
the government; forced disappearances
by the government; torture; arbitrary
detention; political imprisonment; ar-
bitrary interference with privacy;
physical attacks on and criminal pros-
ecution of journalists, lawyers, writers,
bloggers, dissidents, petitioners, and
their family members; interference
with the rights of peaceful assembly
and freedom of association; as well as
severe restrictions on religious free-
doms.
I hope we can take an opportunity
today to honor the victims of the 1989
Tiananmen Square massacre, high-
lighting that the Chinese people still
know very little about what transpired
that night.
I also hope we can have a continued
conversation about the current Com-
munist Chinese Party’s authoritarian
and oppressive tactics that are con-
tinuing to violate the basic human
rights of the Chinese people, and I hope
this is just the beginning of the con-
versation.
China is a clear and present danger.
They have been in an economic war,
and information war. They have been
at war with the West, and particularly
the United States, for the last several
decades, and it is high time that the
American people wake up. This should
just be the beginning.
I thank the makers of this resolution
for doing so, but I hope it is just the
beginning of the conversation, but
more than the conversation, the con-
crete actions that we take against Chi-
na’s aggressive and authoritarian ac-
tions, not only to their own people, but
to the rest of the world, including the
United States.
I hope that we not only support this
President and this administration
when he does the right thing, taking a
hard stance against China, but that
this Congress will take the lead on con-
crete actions regarding China’s malev-
olent behavior around the world, but
particularly in China, with their mar-
kets, with dumping on American mar-
kets, with intellectual property theft,
and the list goes on and on.
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker,
I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman
from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN),
the author of this resolution and one of
the greatest champions of human
rights I have had the privilege to know.
b 1245
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I
thank my colleague for yielding, and I
thank Mr. MCCAUL for his support of
this legislation as well.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H. Res. 393, remembering the
victims of the violent suppression of
democracy protests in Tiananmen
Square and elsewhere in China on June
3 and 4, 1989. The resolution calls on
the Chinese Government to respect the
universally recognized human rights of
all people living in China and around
the world.
It is my hope that the U.S. House of
Representatives will overwhelmingly
support this resolution and send a
strong message that the American peo-
ple stand on the side of those seeking
to exercise their fundamental human
rights in China.
It was 30 years ago, this week, that
an estimated 1 million students, work-
ers, and citizens joined the peaceful
protests in Tiananmen Square and in
over 400 cities throughout China. We
remember with sadness and outrage
the crackdown that followed as the
People’s Liberation Army was un-
leashed on its own people.
One of the most inspiring images in
history is the lone man standing in the
street before the line of tanks on
Tiananmen Square. His act of resist-
ance symbolizes the spirit of
Tiananmen that lives on in the hearts
and minds of those continuing the
struggle in China and abroad.
In China, the Tiananmen Mothers is
a group of relatives and friends of those
killed in June 1989. At great risk to
themselves, they continue to ask for
the right to mourn publicly and call for
a full, public, and independent account-
ing of the victims. The Chinese Govern-
ment fears their memory, their devo-
tion, and their moral standing.
In the years since Tiananmen, the
human rights situation in China has
worsened. Some have described a slow-
motion Tiananmen happening in
Xinjiang with the ongoing mass intern-
ment and surveillance of ethnic
Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims.
A better path forward was offered by
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and
Tiananmen student leader Liu Xiaobo
when he coauthored the political re-
form manifesto Charter 08 that was
signed by more than 10,000 people, de-
spite efforts to censor it. Liu Xiaobo
spent a total of almost 16 years in pris-
on, and he died in state custody in 2017.
Today in China, the Tiananmen
Square massacre is erased from history
books, and any mention of it is
censored. In the last few weeks, the
Chinese Government has tightened
controls to prevent any mention of
Tiananmen and heightened surveil-
lance on the survivors, human rights
advocates, and their families. They
have detained journalists, scholars,
filmmakers, social workers, and labor
rights activists.
But we all know the spirit of
Tiananmen is still alive and well. We
know in part because China’s leaders
demonstrate their fear of it every day
with their security cameras, censor-
ship, detention centers, and obsession
with preventing the people of China
from learning the truth. Imagine the
time, energy, and cost of monitoring
and tracking the actions of 1.4 billion
people.
They are scared because the truth of
Tiananmen threatens the Chinese Com-
munist Party’s legitimacy to govern
China. In his famous last statement in
court, Liu Xiaobo said:
I look forward to the day when my country
is a land with freedom of expression, where
the speech of every citizen will be treated
equally well; where different values, ideas,
beliefs, and political views . . . can both
compete with each other and peacefully co-
exist; where both majority and minority
views will be equally guaranteed, and where
political views that differ from those cur-
rently in power will be fully respected and
protected; where all political views will
spread out under the Sun for people to
choose from, where every citizen can state
political views without fear, and where no
one can under any circumstances suffer po-
litical persecution for voicing divergent po-
litical views.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4235
June 4, 2019
I hope that I will be the last victim in Chi-
na’s long record of treating words as crimes.
No force can block the thirst for freedom
that lies within human nature, and some day
China, too, will be a nation of laws where
human rights are paramount.
I look forward to that day, Madam
Speaker, and let us pass this resolution
with a strong vote. Let us make it
clear that we in the United States Con-
gress stand out loud and foursquare for
human rights and that we stand with
the people of China.
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I am
prepared to close and I yield myself the
balance of my time.
Madam Speaker, I must say at a time
when the American people see this
Congress so divided, it is refreshing for
the American people to see the Con-
gress so united with one voice standing
up for good over evil. We must keep the
memory of Tiananmen alive.
Secretary Pompeo said yesterday
that China’s one-party state tolerates
no dissent and abuses human rights
wherever and whenever it serves its in-
terests.
Today their party’s methods are
more subtle than rolling the tanks in—
but no less horrifying:
The Communist Party deprives one-
fifth of mankind of fundamental
human rights; it has imprisoned up to
3 million Muslims in what the Depart-
ment of Defense has called and labeled
concentration camps; and it is seeking
to spread its totalitarian ideology and
repression along its physical and dig-
ital Belt and Road Initiative.
In the Foreign Affairs Committee, I
know I and my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle will keep working to
shine a light on China’s threats, im-
pose consequences on their malign ac-
tions, foster partnerships with NATO
and other allies, and help build up an
alternative to China’s predatory Belt
and Road influence.
With that, Madam Speaker, I urge
my colleagues to support this resolu-
tion to honor the memory of those who
have sacrificed for freedom and to re-
main clear-eyed about the nature of
our adversary.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume for the purpose of closing.
I will simply say that our disagree-
ment here, the disagreement we have
been expressing in such a united way,
is not with China. It is certainly not
with the Chinese people. It is simply
with the Chinese Government.
We stand in full agreement with the
Chinese people, with everybody in
China who wishes to live in a country
governed by respect for the rule of law
and for human rights. That is what this
resolution is about.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this resolution, and
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker,
it’s been 30 years since the Chinese govern-
ment brutally crushed the peaceful demonstra-
tions occurring in Beijing Tiananmen Square.
The beating, the bayonetting, the torture,
and detentions of the 1989 demonstrators
turned the dream of freedom into a bloody
nightmare.
‘‘Tiananmen’’ will always symbolize the bru-
tal lengths China’s Communist Party will go to
remain in power. When the tanks rolled down
the Square on June 4th, 1989—mothers lost
sons, fathers lost daughters, and China lost an
idealistic generation of future leaders.
The resolution before us, H. Res. 393, hon-
ors the extraordinary sacrifice endured by
thousands of peaceful Chinese democracy ac-
tivists who rallied for almost two months in
Beijing and in over 400 other cities in China,
in a heroic quest for liberty and human rights.
The government of China continues to go to
astounding lengths to censor and ban open
discussion of Tiananmen. This resolution
sends the right message: we will never forget
Tiananmen as long as the Chinese people
cannot discuss its significance openly without
harassment or arrest.
Some may prefer to forget this incident. To
move on and look past the slaughter of peace-
ful demonstrators. But the memory of the dead
and those arrested, tortured, and exiled re-
quires us to honor them, respect their noble
aspirations for fundamental freedoms, and re-
commit ourselves to the struggle for freedom
and human rights in China.
It is both the right thing to do and critical to
the future of U.S.-China relations.
One of the most enduring symbols of the
Tiananmen demonstrations was the unveiling
of the goddess of liberty statue. It was a mo-
ment that thrilled freedom-seekers around the
globe. Here was this enduring symbol of free-
dom juxtaposed against portrait of the despot
Mao Zedong.
This moment was extraordinary because it
showed that when the Chinese people are
able to speak publicly and freely—they ask for
greater freedoms, democracy, and justice.
These are universal liberties that can be found
in demonstrations for liberty worldwide—we
see it in Cairo and Caracas, Burma and Hong
Kong, Tbilisi and Kiev.
There was a moment when we all believed
the Tiananmen Square demonstrations would
be a triumph of freedom and democracy. Later
in 1989, the Warsaw Pact nations started to
crumble and eventually the former Soviet
Union fell as well. But the Communist leaders
of China hung on to power through force and
eventually through the help of Western gov-
ernments and global corporations.
For the past 30 years, the Tiananmen dem-
onstrations have shaped the way the Chinese
government deals with dissent. Despite the
country’s stunning economic growth, Beijing’s
leaders remain terrified of their own people.
China’s ruling Communist Party would rather
stifle, imprison, or even kill its own people
than defer to their demands for freedom and
rights.
There is a direct connection between the
impunity and violence used to silence
Tiananmen demonstrations and deny justice to
the victims of the Tiananmen massacre and
the impunity and violence employed now to
support the internment of over a million
Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in what
only can be called concentration camps.
The egregious human rights abuses occur-
ring in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region
must end—no one can remain silent in the
face of such barbarity and crimes against hu-
manity.
But China is also the torture capital of the
world, the world’s largest jailer of journalists,
with the globe’s worst record on human traf-
ficking and religious freedom. Human rights
lawyers, Tibetans, ethnic minority groups,
labor organizers, and free speech advocates
all face repression and harassment when they
peacefully seek universally recognized rights.
Xi Jinping talks about the ‘‘China Dream’’—
but that dream is nightmare for millions upon
millions upon millions of the Chinese people.
Nevertheless, repression has not dimmed
the desires of the Chinese people for freedom
and reform. There is an inspiring drive in
China to keep fighting for freedom under very
difficult and dangerous conditions.
This drive is the most important asset in
promoting human rights and democratization
in China. If democratic change comes to
China, it will come from within, not because of
outside pressure—though outside pressure
continues to be critically needed.
U.S. policy, in both the short and long-term,
must be, and be seen to be, supportive of ad-
vocates for peaceful change; it must support
the champions of liberty, and help nurture a vi-
brant civil society that seeks to promote rights
and freedoms for everyone in China. And, we
must fight to end China’s pervasive internet
censorship and mass surveillance—so the
Chinese people can finally learn about
Tiananmen and the truth about their own gov-
ernment.
Our strategic and moral interests coincide
when we seek to promote human rights and
democratic openness in China. A more demo-
cratic China, one that respects human rights,
and is governed by the rule of law, is more
likely to be a productive and peaceful partner
rather than strategic and hostile competitor.
I believe that someday China will be free.
Someday, the people of China will be able to
enjoy all of their God-given rights. And a na-
tion of free Chinese men and women will
honor, applaud, and celebrate the heroes of
Tiananmen Square and all those who sac-
rificed so much, and so long, for freedom.
I support H. Res. 393 and the message that
it sends. I hope it will re-inspire, re-energize,
and reprioritize a struggle for human rights
and freedom in China.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in strong support of H.R. 393, a resolu-
tion ‘‘Remembering the victims of Tiananmen
Square.’’
H. Res. 393 remembers the victims of the
violent suppression of democracy protests in
Tiananmen Square and elsewhere in China on
June 3 and 4, 1989 and calls on the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China to re-
spect the universally recognized human rights
of all people living in China and around the
world.
On June 4, 1989, a violent crackdown on
peaceful demonstrations held in and around
Beijing’s Tiananmen Square was carried out
by the People’s Liberation Army, following or-
ders given by the Government of the People’s
Republic of China.
An estimated 1,000,000 people joined the
protests in Tiananmen Square and citizens in
over 400 Chinese cities staged similar protests
calling for democratic reform, including not
only students, but also government employ-
ees, journalists, workers, police officers, mem-
bers of the armed forces, and other citizens.
These peaceful demonstrations of 1989
called upon the Government of the People’s

Republic of China to eliminate corruption, ac-
celerate economic and political reform, and
protect human rights, particularly the freedoms
of expression and assembly, issues that re-
main relevant in United States-China relations
30 years later.
Although these activists’ reform efforts con-
tinue to inspire the Chinese people, the Gov-
ernment of the People’s Republic of China
takes active measures to deny its citizens the
truth about the Tiananmen Square massacre,
including the blocking of uncensored internet
sites and social media commentary on
microblog and other messaging services, and
the placement of misleading information on
the events of June 3 and 4, 1989, on internet
sites available in China.
The Chinese government also continues to
silence the voices and memory of these activ-
ists through gruesome attacks on demonstra-
tors who recognize the false information being
spread by the Chinese Government.
On May 20, 1989, martial law was declared
in Beijing, China, after authorities had failed to
persuade demonstrators to leave Tiananmen
Square, sending thousands of armed troops,
supported by tanks and other armor, moved
into Beijing and the surrounding streets where
the forces fired into crowds of unarmed civil-
ians.
The ‘‘Remembering the victims of
Tiananmen Square’’ Act promises to do this
by expressing sympathy and solidarity to the
families of those killed, tortured, and impris-
oned for their participation in the pro-democ-
racy demonstrations during the spring of 1989
in Beijing and in other cities across the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China and verbally sup-
porting the leaders of the Tiananmen dem-
onstrations and all those who peacefully
sought political reform, democratic trans-
parency, the rule of law, and protections for
universally recognized human rights in China.
The resolution also renounces the practices
of the Chinese government’s actions during
and after the Tiananmen Square Protest and
calls on the government to take responsibility
for the number of deaths that occurred during
the violent suppression of the spring 1989
Tiananmen demonstrations, rehabilitate the
reputations of those who participated in the
demonstrations and those detained for seek-
ing to commemorate the anniversary of the
demonstrations, and cease the censoring of
information and discussion about the
Tiananmen Square massacre, including at
Confucius Institutes worldwide.
Through these actions, H.R. 393 promises
to adequately relay the United States’ dis-
appointment with the violence towards
Tiananmen demonstrators and aid the advo-
cates and protestors in their quest for pro-
tected human rights.
The Government of the People’s Republic of
China continues to actively suppress univer-
sally recognized rights by imprisoning or re-
stricting the activities of pro-democracy activ-
ists, human rights lawyers, citizen journalists,
labor union leaders, religious believers, mem-
bers of ethnic minorities, and individuals in the
Xinjiang and Tibetan regions, among many
others who seek to express their political or
religious views or their ethnic identity in a
peaceful manner.
Despite persistent, ongoing, and sometimes
brutal repression, the desire of Chinese citi-
zens to risk life, limb, and liberty to exercise
universally recognized human rights, ensure
the rule of law, and promote political reform
cannot be extinguished, thus the legacy of
Tiananmen Square lives on.

PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION
OF H.R. 6, AMERICAN DREAM
AND PROMISE ACT OF 2019
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, by
direction of the Committee on Rules, I
call up House Resolution 415 and ask
for its immediate consideration.
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 415
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to consider in the
House the bill (H.R. 6) to authorize the can-
cellation of removal and adjustment of sta-
tus of certain aliens, and for other purposes.
All points of order against consideration of
the bill are waived. An amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute consisting of the text of
Rules Committee Print 116-16, modified by
the amendment printed in the report of the
Committee on Rules accompanying this res-
olution, shall be considered as adopted. The
bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.
All points of order against provisions in the
bill, as amended, are waived. The previous
question shall be considered as ordered on
the bill, as amended, and on any further
amendment thereto, to final passage without
intervening motion except: (1) two hours of
debate equally divided and controlled by the
chair and ranking minority member of the
Committee on the Judiciary; and (2) one mo-
tion to recommit with or without instruc-
tions.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Florida is recognized
for 1 hour.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, for
the purpose of debate only, I yield the
customary 30 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO),
pending which I yield myself such time
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only.
GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Florida?
There was no objection.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, on
Monday, the Rules Committee met and
reported a rule, House Resolution 415,
providing for consideration of H.R. 6,
the American Dream and Promise Act,
under a closed rule self-executing a
manager’s amendment. The rule pro-
vides 2 hours of debate, equally divided
and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing member of the Committee on the
Judiciary.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the bill in this rule, H.R. 6, the
American Dream and Promise Act. I
rise as the granddaughter of immi-
grants.
This is a historic day in which we
begin to shape immigration policy that
reflects American values. H.R. 6 offers
a path to lawful permanent residence
status for Dreamers, TPS holders, and
DED beneficiaries. These are our neigh-
bors, our friends, our schoolmates, our
workers, and our family. They make
our communities stronger and fuller.
They are Americans in every way ex-
cept under the law. We intend to cor-
rect that omission today.
These immigrants are longtime resi-
dents of our country with deep roots in
the communities where they reside.
For many of them, the United States is
the only country they have ever called
home. It is cruel and un-American that
we have left members of our commu-
nities to suffer uncertainty in this
way.
With this bill, we keep families to-
gether and ensure that these women,
men, and children can continue con-
tributing to the communities we share.
In my district, Florida’s 27th, there are
11,400 residents who are eligible for pro-
tection under H.R. 6. Approximately
8,200 are Dreamers, and 3,400 are TPS
or DED holders.
As I have long said, in my south
Florida community, it doesn’t matter
the color of your skin, the language
you speak, whom you hold hands with,
your religion, or your country of ori-
gin. You are a Miamian if you call our
city home. Today, the House of Rep-
resentatives will make clear that you
have every right to call yourselves
Americans, too.
Madam Speaker, I proudly support
this historic step forward towards a
more just America. Let’s pass this rule
and H.R. 6.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume,
and I thank Representative SHALALA
for yielding me the customary 30 min-
utes.
Madam Speaker, circumstances de-
mand that we make substantial im-
provements to our Nation’s broken im-
migration system. My home State of
Arizona is at the forefront of a crisis
on our Nation’s southern border, but
the bill before us today offers no solu-
tions and will instead, I believe, exac-
erbate the problem.
I have represented the people of Ari-
zona for over a decade. Last Congress,
I was honored when the people of Ari-
zona’s Eighth Congressional District
sent me to represent them here in
Washington, D.C.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4237
June 4, 2019
For my constituents, as residents of
a border State, fixing our broken im-
migration system is a top priority.
With Customs and Border Patrol appre-
hending 4,500 people per day and, in
April, over 100,000 people just in that
month alone, it is critical to develop
and implement a solution immediately.
As a member on the Homeland Secu-
rity Committee, the Committee on the
Judiciary’s Subcommittee on Immigra-
tion and Citizenship, and the House
Rules Committee, I stand ready to
work with my colleagues, Democrats
and Republicans, to develop real solu-
tions to our immigration crisis.
Unfortunately, with the bill and the
rule before us today, it is evident that
the majority has no intention of ad-
vancing consensus legislation to fix our
broken immigration system. The bill
advances a series of what I believe are
flawed policies.
As the bill worked its way through
the committee process, the majority
denied reasonable amendments to im-
prove the bill; and the rule passed in a
party-line vote—very partisan bill—by
the Rules Committee does not allow for
amendments to be considered by this
body as a whole at all. It is a closed
rule.
b 1300
Democrats have framed this bill as a
solution for recipients of the Deferred
Action for Childhood Arrival program,
or DACA, a laudable goal.
In fact, last night in the Rules Com-
mittee, the chairman said it is only de-
signed for a small group of people, the
DACA recipients. Well, that is just not
true.
In fact, the American people should
know what this bill really does. It pro-
vides green cards and, thus, a special
path to citizenship to millions of ille-
gal aliens, whether they are current re-
cipients of DACA or not.
Unlike President Obama’s executive
order on DACA, this bill allows people
who have been living in the United
States illegally for 40 years—decades—
to get a special path to citizenship.
That is not what President Obama’s
DACA program did.
It places the interests of those who
violated U.S. immigration laws above
the interests of those who have been
waiting and waiting to enter this coun-
try legally. It provides amnesty. It will
only incentivize further illegal immi-
gration.
The American people should also
know what this bill fails to do.
It does nothing to provide the men
and women protecting our border with
the resources they need to keep our
country safe. It does nothing to fix the
de facto system of catch and release. It
does nothing to remedy the crisis at
our southern border. In fact, I believe
it will make it worse.
Finally, the American people should
know the changes that my Republican
colleagues and I proposed to improve
upon this bill, all of which my Demo-
cratic colleagues rejected.
Democrats rejected an amendment to
exclude aliens convicted of mis-
demeanor firearms convictions from
getting this special pathway. Demo-
crats rejected an amendment to ex-
clude illegals convicted of a mis-
demeanor DUI offense if the alien’s
conduct killed or injured another per-
son or if they had multiple DUIs.
What this means is, if there was an
illegal immigrant who had a mis-
demeanor DUI that severely injured
someone, they are still welcomed in
under this plan.
Approximately half of the 158,000 peo-
ple arrested by ICE in fiscal year 2018,
the illegal immigrants who were ar-
rested, or about 81,000, had been
charged or convicted of driving under
the influence. This bill could reward
people like this with a special pathway
to citizenship.
Democrats also rejected an amend-
ment to make gang members ineligible
for benefits under this bill.
Democrats also rejected an amend-
ment to make fraud a ground for ineli-
gibility. In fact, I proposed an amend-
ment that said, if they fraudulently fill
out the application form, or misrepre-
sented themselves as U.S. citizens in
the past to get benefits, they would be
rejected. Unfortunately, my Demo-
cratic colleagues said no, welcome
them in.
Democrats rejected an amendment to
remedy a confidentiality provision that
prevents information contained in an
application from being used for law en-
forcement purposes, thereby impeding
law enforcement efforts.
To summarize, under this bill: Gun
criminals are welcome. Drunk drivers
are welcome. Gang members are wel-
come. Fraudsters are welcome. But law
enforcement hands are tied.
From the bill’s text and failure to
adopt reasonable amendments, it is
clear that my Democratic colleagues
do not value the integrity of our immi-
gration system or ensuring that crimi-
nals do not exploit loopholes in their
bill. At best, they are choosing to ig-
nore the chaos at the border and to ig-
nore the perverse incentives of their
policy of wide-reaching amnesty. At
worst, they are encouraging it.
Last Congress, Republicans voted for
a DACA solution that enforces the law
and remedies our immigration system.
Republicans recognized that America is
a nation of immigrants but also that
the world has changed since we put in
place the immigration laws governing
our enforcement efforts along the
southern border and that we need im-
migration laws reformed.
That bill that Republicans proposed
and I supported last year would have
addressed DACA by allowing DACA re-
cipients to obtain legal status. It would
not have allowed for a special pathway
to citizenship. It would not have al-
lowed them to jump in front of the
line.
That Republican bill recognized that
many DACA recipients entered this
country without legal documentation
through no fault of their own but that
they were in the country and we need-
ed a solution.
That Republican bill would have also
secured our border, improved enforce-
ment, and addressed our need for
skilled workers. It authorized a border
wall, mandated E-Verify, and increased
visas for the skilled workers we need
most. It also eliminated the diversity
visa lottery and increased the credible
fear standard to combat asylum fraud.
The bill offered reasonable immigra-
tion reform, but not one single Demo-
cratic Member of Congress voted in
favor of it. Instead, today, my Demo-
cratic colleagues are advancing a bill
that offers no reforms to the legal im-
migration system, no border security,
no solutions for the humanitarian cri-
sis that is happening each and every
day at our border. And it comes with a
$35 billion price tag.
The crisis at our southern border is
real and substantial, with Customs and
Border Protection apprehending an av-
erage of 4,500 people per day on the
southern border. Border Patrol facili-
ties are beyond capacity. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement facilities are
full.
The number of people apprehended in
the past 7 months has already sur-
passed any year since 2009. At this rate,
CBP will apprehend over 1.64 million
people in just 1 year. That is more than
the last recorded official population of
the city of Phoenix.
We must develop and implement a so-
lution to the crisis at our southern bor-
der immediately. Instead, we have be-
fore us a partisan bill to provide am-
nesty to millions of people and
incentivize countless more to cross our
border illegally.
This bill has no chance of being
taken up by the U.S. Senate or signed
by the President.
The majority’s inaction to the crisis
at our southern border is absolutely
unacceptable. Speaker PELOSI and the
Democratic leadership refused to even
fund the extra funding for the humani-
tarian crisis that would help the chil-
dren and the migrants themselves.
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to
the rule, and I reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. LOFGREN), the dis-
tinguished chair of the Committee on
the Judiciary’s Subcommittee on Im-
migration and Citizenship.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
stand here today in strong support of
H.R. 6, the American Dream and Prom-
ise Act of 2019, a product of decades-
long advocacy, grit, and compromise.
I am extremely proud to stand with
Dreamers and recipients of temporary
protected status and deferred enforced
departure. We are here because of their
hard work, as well as the steadfast de-
termination of immigrant rights
groups, faith-based organizations, labor
unions, civil rights groups, business as-
sociations, and so many of my col-
leagues who have worked tirelessly to
bring this bill to the floor today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4238 June 4, 2019
Our work has paid off. There is wide-
spread, bipartisan support across the
country for protecting Dreamers and
passing the American Dream and
Promise Act.
Just yesterday, over 100 business
leaders urged us to vote in favor of the
bill, including household companies
such as eBay, Hewlett-Packard, IKEA,
Chobani, and Levi Strauss. They sup-
port the bill because the United States
will benefit economically from its pas-
sage.
The Chamber of Commerce says that
it supports the bill, and it may make
the vote on the American Dream and
Promise Act a key vote.
Even now, more than 70 percent of
the top 25 Fortune 500 companies,
which generate $3 trillion in annual
revenue, employ Dreamers. Even the
conservative Cato Institute found that
allowing Dreamers to remain here
would add an extra $350 billion to our
economy and an additional $90 billion
in tax revenue.
On the other hand, failure to support
lawful status for Dreamers will di-
rectly undermine our competitiveness
and subject them to permanent exile.
That makes no sense.
We have waited long enough. It is
time for us to pass the American
Dream and Promise Act in the House of
Representatives.
It was 2001 when the first iteration of
the Dream Act was introduced. Eight-
een years later, we are finally poised to
pass it.
We have seen the benefit of President
Obama’s DACA announcement, a tem-
porary initiative that allowed these
young people to temporarily work and
to stay without looking over their
shoulders. The courts have kept us
from seeing the destruction of DACA
that President Trump had ordered,
even though polls show that almost 90
percent of Americans support legal rec-
ognition for Dreamers.
Dreamers are Americans. All they
lack is the paper to prove it. They live
in every one of our 50 States. Their
families hail from every region of the
world. Their contributions are felt all
across the landscape of this country.
Among them are future industry
leaders; nurses; doctors; chefs; con-
struction workers; teachers, including
5,000 teachers in California; and care
providers for our children and parents.
Dreamers are joined in their efforts
by TPS and DED brethren. In the same
month that the administration an-
nounced the end of DACA, they also
announced the termination of TPS for
six countries and, a few weeks later,
the termination of DED for Liberians,
even though many of them have been
here for 30 years.
More than 400,000 nationals of seven
countries now face exile from the
United States. The majority have lived
here for at least 20 years, building their
lives, raising families that include
more than a quarter of a million U.S.
citizen children.
The future for Dreamers and long-
time TPS and DED recipients does not
have to be uncertain. We have the op-
portunity to pass the American Dream
and Promise Act in the House of Rep-
resentatives today and, by doing so,
put those Dreamers and strivers on the
path to legal recognition.
Let’s put partisan fights aside for the
good of our Nation, for the good of our
economy and our communities. Ap-
prove this rule and, later today, vote
for the American Dream and Promise
Act.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. BIGGS).
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I want
to give context to this before I talk
specifically about the idea of a closed
rule here, which I oppose so much.
First of all, there are about 690,000 in
the DACA population, but there is an
estimate that there is another 1 to 1.2
million, though no one really knows
what that number is, who might have
applied but chose not to apply under
the Obama-era DACA regulations.
We also have a significant popu-
lation, post-2012, who have been
brought here. We had a surge in 2013
and a surge in 2014 of unaccompanied
minors. We have again seen a surge in
the last few months even. We don’t
know what the population looks like
for this.
Another way to put this into context
is this way: We have a million people
who have absconded from their court
dates. That means they haven’t shown
up. They got an order to appear, and
they are not showing up. We have an-
other million with active removal or-
ders.
That is 2 million people who are
roaming the country. We don’t know
who they are, where they are.
We brought in 1.2 million legal immi-
grants last year. That is a good thing.
We are going to catch more than 1.2.
We will apprehend more than 1.2 mil-
lion illegal aliens coming across our
border this year. These are numbers
that are almost unfathomable.
That population I just mentioned
would be the second largest city in the
United States after New York City,
more than Los Angeles itself.
b 1315
When we say that we are going to ap-
prehend 1.2 million this year, when one
talks to Border Patrol agents, people
who conduct censuses on these things,
they will say that we have no idea any
longer what the getaway number is. A
year ago, they thought they were
catching 1 in 2. Four months ago, they
thought they were catching 1 in 3.
Today, they will say that they have ab-
solutely no idea.
Last week, in El Paso alone, one
group of over 1,000 people were appre-
hended.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
the gentleman from Arizona an addi-
tional 2 minutes.
Mr. BIGGS. A group of 1,000 was ap-
prehended, and 2,200 came in through
El Paso, in 1 day alone, who were ap-
prehended. We are averaging about
4,500 apprehensions a day in this coun-
try.
What happened when this bill came
to markup? Why is it, in my opinion, a
real problem that we have a closed rule
here? The Republicans offered a num-
ber of amendments. We pointed out
issues that we thought were of concern.
We offered amendments to address
those issues, such as allowing repeat
criminals and gang members to obtain
green cards. We offered amendments
that would allow application informa-
tion regarding illegal status to be used
for deportation. We attempted to pre-
vent fraudulent applications from
being filed.
But none of these and a whole host of
other amendments offered by Repub-
licans were accepted, even some that
were just absolutely rational, such as
those with DUIs that resulted in an ac-
cident where someone was seriously in-
jured or even killed. They were not pre-
vented from obtaining this path of le-
galization.
Here we are today, and now they are
saying no amendments can be offered
from either side of the aisle. I have es-
sentially opposed every closed rule
since I came to Congress. I think it ac-
tually undermines this process where
we represent districts and come to try
to offer amendments. I have offered
many amendments and had them all
shut down, quite frankly, whether by
vote or in the Rules Committee.
But the reality is, I represent a dis-
trict, and when the majority closes a
rule like this, it is preventing me from
representing a border State that has a
great deal of difficulties because of the
rampant border crossings of illegal
aliens.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I rise to support the underlying bill
and the rule that is presently before us.
As I do so, let me thank my colleague
on the Judiciary Committee. We have
served for any number of years, and
Congresswoman LOFGREN has been on
the front lines of reason and trying to
address the question of comprehensive
immigration reform.
Together, respectively, and parallel
to each other, we have introduced, over
and over again, comprehensive immi-
gration reform. We have watched it be
refuted and rebutted by those who real-
ly could have helped us solve even the
problem of the surge that we are seeing
crossing the border today.
Let me, as well, thank Madam
Speaker, who has been engaged in a
very important way, and my friend and
colleague LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD,
who has clearly been leading on this
issue and many others. Let me thank
the Judiciary Committee as well,
where we came together as a team.
Let me reinforce what has been said
over and over again, and that is that
Dreamers are Americans. Those who

are beneficiaries of TPS, they have
been here 20 to 30 years because of the
difficulty of their home countries.
They have, likewise, shown themselves
to love this country.
There was a period of time when
Dreamers had joined in and went to the
Iraq war. They were not citizens, but
they went there because they loved
this country so much. They came as a
child, and they realized the wonder-
ment of this country.
It is important to convince those who
believe that we are opening the doors
and that we are reckless. Let me be
very clear. Besides the Immigration
and Nationality Act that is already in
existence, there are very clear param-
eters on dealing with people who are
felons or a threat to national security,
individuals who have committed DUIs,
those who have misdemeanors. There
are clear parameters of ensuring that
the Nation is protected. But, as well,
there is dignity and human rights.
There is also the question of what in-
vestment in dollars you will lose, what
you will throw away, $460 billion from
the national GDP over the decade from
685,000 workers—in my own State, $8
billion annually in the State GDP.
Immigrants are in the fabric of our
society. We are immigrant and non-
immigrant. All of us have come from
that history. Mine is different, having
been brought here by, meaning those
who are of African American heritage,
as slaves.
386,300 immigrants are eligible under
the American Dream and Promise Act,
and 120,000 live in Harris County.
But this is the story that I want to
tell and dwell on. A Dreamer died try-
ing to rescue Hurricane Harvey vic-
tims. That is Alonso Guillen, who came
to help those in the darkest moments
of our region, during Hurricane Har-
vey, the greatest and most significant
disaster.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentlewoman has expired.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
yield the gentlewoman from Texas an
additional 2 minutes.
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker,
I thank the gentlewoman for her cour-
tesy.
He came from Lufkin, Texas. He
loved Texas football and country
music. He had fundraisers for any man-
ner of needs in his area.
When he saw the devastation and the
people in water in Harris County, and
we were in 51 trillion gallons of water,
he came, with a little boat and a
friend. He didn’t ask whether they were
immigrant or nonimmigrant, Dreamer
or non-Dreamer, what their back-
ground was. As they were in the water,
as they were on their rooftops, as they
were desperate without food, he came.
Tragically, his family had come to,
ultimately, find him floating in the
water, when his boat had toppled and,
we believe, had been impacted by the
wires in the water.
This is the face of Dreamers. This is
the face of those who would benefit
from temporary protective status com-
ing from Nepal, from El Salvador, and
from countries that are under major
devastation.
Many times, there is crime in Amer-
ica, and I understand that. But people
don’t imagine what it is to flee from
the natural disasters that these indi-
viduals have fled from, to have no re-
lief from the government, and to com-
pound that with the violence that is
going on, knowing so much violence.
I stand here today to ask for rational
thought. With a multitude of organiza-
tions, I want to raise up one, the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce. It doesn’t come
lightly to this question. I would argue
that, had we passed comprehensive im-
migration reform 10 years ago, 15 years
ago, the question of surging across the
border would not be an issue.
Let me also be clear that we have
built barriers across the border for
more than a decade. I remember giving
huge sums of money to ensure it, in
certain spaces.
What we are saying now is that that
is not a sole solution. The solution is
regularizing individuals with the safe-
guards of this legislation.
I would hope my colleagues, Repub-
licans and Democrats, as Americans,
understand that this Nation was built
with the sweat and tears and love of
immigrants. Every American, except
Native Americans, can point to coming
from somewhere else, no matter what
condition they were in when they
came.
I ask our colleagues to support this
legislation, H.R. 6, because it is the
American thing to do.
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the
Committees on the Judiciary and on Home-
land Security, and a representative of a state
on the southern border, I rise in strong support
of the rule governing debate of H.R. 6, the
‘‘American Dream and Promise Act of 2019,’’
and the underlying legislation.
The American Dream and Promise Act of
2019 establishes a roadmap to U.S. citizen-
ship for (1) immigrant youth and (2) current or
potential holders of (a) temporary protected
status (TPS) or (b) deferred enforced depar-
ture (DED).
Ensuring a path to earned citizenship is a
non-negotiable principle for me and the sine
qua non of meaningful immigration reform leg-
islation.
Indeed, providing a path to earned access
to citizenship has been a central feature of
every comprehensive immigration reform bill I
have co-sponsored or sponsored in the Con-
gress since 2007 when I became Ranking
Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee
on Immigration and introduced the ‘‘Save
America Comprehensive Immigration Reform
Act, (H.R. 1525),’’ which I have reintroduced in
each succeeding Congress.
Like H.R. 6, Section 501 of my legislation
provides a path to earned legalization status
to those undocumented immigrants who have
resided in the United States for 5 years and
meet other eligibility requirements.
Madam Speaker, as we stand today on the
precipice of passing the American Dream and
Promise Act of 2019, I am thinking of the hun-
dreds of thousands of young immigrants
whose lives will be changed for the better by
keeping our promise to them, so they can re-
alize their dreams and making America better,
stronger, and more prosperous.
And at this moment, I am thinking of Alonso
Guillen, an heroic DREAMER who lived in my
congressional district, and who came to the
United States from Mexico as a child and died
when his boat capsized while he was rescuing
survivors of the flooding caused by Hurricane
Harvey in the Houston area.
That is the type of courage, honor, and
commitment to service we are talking when
we speak of DREAMERS.
Madam Speaker, Title I of H.R. 6, the
Dream Act of 2019, contains provisions re-
garding relief for immigrant youth.
Title II of the bill, American Promise Act of
2019, contains provisions related to persons
eligible Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or
Deferred Enforcement Departure; the third and
final title contains general provisions that apply
to both Titles I & II).
Madam Speaker, I support H.R. 6 because
it keeps America’s word to the more than
800,000 young people we asked to come out
of the shadows and walk proudly and un-
ashamedly as legitimate members of the
American community.
The legislation does this by providing condi-
tional permanent resident (CPR) status and a
roadmap to lawful permanent resident (LPR)
status and, eventually, earned U.S. citizenship
for immigrant youth who entered the U.S. be-
fore age 18, have four or more years of resi-
dency, and graduated from high school (or the
equivalent).
H.R. 6 also provides an opportunity to apply
for LPR status for people who currently have
or who may be eligible for TPS or DED and
who have three or more years of residency.
Madam Speaker, individuals who are eligi-
ble for protection under the bill have lived in
the United States for much of their lives; the
average Dreamer came to the United States
at the age of 8, while the average TPS- or
DED-eligible person arrived in 1997.
Without permanent protections such as
those in H.R. 6, these immigrants’ and their
families’ futures in the United States—as well
as the fiscal and economic contributions they
make—are at risk.
Passing this legislation is the right thing to
do and now is the time to do it; in fact, it is
long overdue.
I am mindful also Madam Speaker that in
addition to helping restore America’s reputa-
tion as the most welcoming nation on earth,
the legislation the House will pass also posi-
tions America to better compete and win in the
global economy of the 21st century.
According to expert studies, including one
by the Center for American Progress, ending
deferred action for childhood arrivals would re-
sult in a loss of $460.3 billion from the national
GDP over the ensuing decade and would re-
move an estimated 685,000 workers from the
nation’s economy and workforce at a time
when more, not fewer, workers are des-
perately needed.
And 10 states, including my home state of
Texas, would stand to lose more than $8 bil-
lion annually in state GDP.
Madam Speaker, immigrants eligible for pro-
tection under H.R. 6 are part of Texas’s social
fabric.
Texas is home to 386,300 immigrants who
are eligible for protection under the Dream

and Promise Act, 112,000 of whom reside in
Harris County.
These individuals live with 845,300 family
members and among those family members,
178,700 are U.S.-born citizen children.
Dreamers in Texas who are eligible for pro-
tection under the bill arrived in the United
States at the average age of 8.
TPS- and DED-eligible immigrants in Texas
who would be eligible for protection under
H.R. 6 have on average lived in the United
States since 1996.
Immigrants eligible for the Dream and Prom-
ise Act own 43,500 homes in Texas and pay
$340,500,000 in annual mortgage payments.
Eligible immigrants in Texas and their
households contribute $2,234,800,000 in fed-
eral taxes and $1,265,200,000 in state and
local taxes each year.
Annually, these households generate
$10,519,000,000 in spending power in Texas
and help power the national economy.
Madam Speaker, during general debate on
H.R. 6, I will have more to discuss about the
salient features of this long overdue legislation
that fulfills the American promise that all of its
residents who share our values and respect
for the Constitution and laws have an oppor-
tunity to realize their dreams.
But in the limited time I have now, let me
highlight some of the more important provi-
sions of the American Dream and Promise
Act.
H.R. 6 helps young persons in the following
ways:
1. Extends the length of conditional perma-
nent resident (CPR) status from eight to ten
years to give applicants more time to fulfill re-
quirements;
2. Stays the removal of minors who are not
yet eligible for relief but may become eligible
in the future and who temporarily unenroll
from school;
3. Permits people with CPR to obtain legal
permanent resident (LPR) status without satis-
fying the employment, military, or educational
tracks if their deportation would cause ‘‘hard-
ship’’ to themselves or immediate family mem-
bers (instead of ‘‘extreme hardship’’);
4. Includes apprenticeship programs as a
qualifying education to obtain CPR status;
5. Eliminates the costly medical examination
for applicants;
6. Establishes a fee ceiling of $495 for im-
migrant youth applying for CPR status;
7. Clarifies that people with CPR can ac-
cess professional, commercial, and business
licenses;
8. Permits people with CPR who obtain a
certificate or credential from an area career
and technical education school to obtain LPR
status; and
9. Updates the criminal background bars
and inadmissibility requirements.
Additionally, H.R. 6 provides LPR status to
CPR holders who (1) serve in the uniformed
services for two years; (2) complete two years
at or obtain a degree from an institution of
higher education; or (3) work 75 percent of the
time in CPR.
Another important feature of this legislation
is that makes it easier for states to provide in-
state tuition to immigrant students and estab-
lishes that CPR-holders are eligible for federal
loans, work study, services, and grants.
For persons with TPS or DED status, the
American Dream and Promise Act provides
much needed relief.
First, H.R. 6 provides LPR status for people
with TPS or DED (and those who were eligible
but did not apply) who apply within three years
from the date of enactment if they (1) had at
least three years of continuous residence (as
well as residence since the date required the
last time that the person’s nation of origin was
designated) and (2) were eligible for or had (a)
TPS on September 25, 2016, or (b) DED on
September 28, 2016.
This protection covers national of 13 coun-
tries: El Salvador, Guinea, Haiti, Honduras, Li-
beria, Nepal, Nicaragua, Sierra Leone, Soma-
lia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.
I believe similar protections should be ex-
tended to Guatemalan nationals in our coun-
try, which is why I will soon reintroduce the
‘‘Continue American Safety Act,’’ which ex-
tends TPS status to Guatemala and I look for-
ward to working with my colleagues to achieve
this outcome.
Second, H.R. 6 classifies people with TPS
or DED as inspected and admitted for the pur-
poses of Immigration & Nationality Act (INA)
section 245(a), making it easier to obtain LPR
status through existing channels (e.g., a fam-
ily-based petition).
Third, H.R. 6 stays the removal or deporta-
tion of an a individual while an application is
pending.
Fourth, the American Dream and Promise
Act establishes a fee ceiling of $1,140 for peo-
ple with TPS or DED applying for LPR status.
Fifth, the legislation provides greater trans-
parency by requiring the Secretary of the
Homeland Security (DHS) to provide an expla-
nation for and report within three days of pub-
lishing notice to terminate TPS designation for
certain nationals.
Madam Speaker, H.R. 6 is exceptional leg-
islation and a welcome development but is not
a substitute for undertaking the comprehen-
sive reform and modernization of the nation’s
immigration laws supported by the American
people.
Only Congress can do that and passage of
H.R. 6 shows that this House has the will and
is up to the challenge.
Comprehensive immigration reform is des-
perately needed to ensure that Lady Liberty’s
lamp remains the symbol of a land that wel-
comes immigrants to a community of immi-
grants and does so in a manner that secures
our borders and protects our homeland.
Madam Speaker, let us build on the historic
legislation that is the American Dream and
Promise Act and seize the opportunity to pass
legislation that secures our borders, preserves
America’s character as the most open and
welcoming country in the history of the world,
and will yield hundreds of billions of dollars in
economic growth.
I urge all Members to support the rule gov-
erning debate of H.R. 6 and the underlying
bill.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. GOSAR).
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise
today as a grandchild of legal immi-
grants to this country.
We are debating whether or not to
grant the greatest gift our Nation has
to offer, permanent residency and citi-
zenship. We must get our priorities
straight.
While we are here in the middle of a
humanitarian crisis on the southern
border, Democratic leadership is choos-
ing to bring amnesty for millions of il-
legal immigrants to a vote.
By choosing to ignore our current
immigration laws, Democrats are effec-
tively inviting the mass migration of
illegal immigrants across our border
States, including Arizona. If enacted,
this would be the largest amnesty in
U.S. history. It would do nothing to en-
force our laws but, instead, reward
lawbreakers.
This legislation grants smugglers and
gang members with green cards and a
path to citizenship. It will simply serve
to incentivize more migrants to come
to the United States illegally.
Congress should work with the ad-
ministration in stopping the surge of
illegal immigration, not incentivizing
more caravans.
My constituents have recently and
repeatedly made it clear that Arizona’s
Fourth Congressional District does not
support amnesty.
This bill does not promise the Amer-
ican Dream but, rather, the perpetra-
tion of a crisis. This crisis is doing real
harm to Arizona and all of America.
I encourage my colleagues not to
vote for H.R. 6, which would only serve
to enable the humanitarian crisis on
our southern border and does nothing
to close loopholes or even enforce ex-
isting law.
I find this legislation to be a dis-
grace. The American people deserve
better. It is time this Congress started
putting American citizens first.
It came as a closed rule. That shows
you that it is bad process and bad pol-
icy.
As former Supreme Court Justice
Louis Brandeis is quoted: ‘‘In a govern-
ment of laws, existence of the govern-
ment will be imperiled if it fails to ob-
serve the law scrupulously. . . . If the
government becomes a lawbreaker, it
breeds contempt for law; it invites
every man to become a law unto him-
self; it invites anarchy.’’
Do I need to say anything else?
I ask my colleagues to reject this leg-
islation and vote ‘‘no.’’
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from
Vermont (Mr. WELCH).
Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, this is
a bright day in the history of the
House. We are going to provide relief to
people who are innocent.
We have the debate about immigra-
tion, no question about it. But we are
talking about children, infants, in
some cases, who were brought here
through no decision of their own. They
then went to school here, began a ca-
reer here, built a family here. In many
cases, they served in the military here
and served as first responders.
This is finally an opportunity for
those Dreamers to have legal status,
2.5 million of them.
We are also going to provide tem-
porary protected status to other law-
abiding people living and contributing
here.
This is a big deal in Vermont. First,
for the people, for those affected, it is

relief. It is about time. Second, they
are contributing to the economy with
the jobs that they perform and the
taxes that they pay, about $3.5 million
in Federal taxes and $2 million in State
and local taxes.
One, in particular, is a student at the
University of Vermont Medical School,
Juan Conde. He was brought here from
Mexico when he was 9 years old. His
mom later died of cancer.
His goal in life is to help cancer vic-
tims. First, he got a master’s degree in
chemistry and a Ph.D. in molecular bi-
ology, doing research to advance a cure
for cancer. Now he is a student at the
University of Vermont Medical School,
and he is dedicating his life to cancer
research and cancer treatment.
What a win it is for this country to
have the services of this bright, ideal-
istic young man. This legislation is
going to allow him to have the security
that we all need in order to be the best
that we can possibly be as a contrib-
uting member of society.
A confident nation welcomes people
who are law-abiding citizens. Pass this
legislation overwhelmingly.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from North
Carolina (Mr. BUDD).
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I have
noticed a trend lately with the bills
that we are voting on. They all have
attractive names: the Save the Inter-
net Act, the Equality Act, and now the
thing that we are voting on this week,
the American Dream and Promise Act.
I rise in opposition to this bill be-
cause great titles don’t equal great
policies. H.R. 6 doesn’t really provide a
legal pathway for the DACA popu-
lation. Instead, it gives green cards to,
potentially, millions of illegal aliens.
There is no age limit, and the bill is so
broad that it prohibits DHS from using
evidence found in Federal or State
gang databases as the reason to deny
an application.
b 1330
The bill also does nothing to address
the humanitarian crisis at our south-
ern border, absolutely nothing.
Madam Speaker, I visited the south-
ern border earlier this year and I saw
the crisis firsthand. I talked with our
Border Patrol agents, who need Con-
gress’ help.
Many things are needed to fix our im-
migration system, but what isn’t need-
ed is a political messaging bill that has
no chance of passing the Senate or
being signed into law.
Madam Speaker, clever bill titles
don’t equal good policy, and good in-
tentions don’t always lead to good out-
comes. I swore an oath to defend the
rule of law, and that is what I will con-
tinue to do.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. ROY), my good friend.
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs.
LESKO) for her time and energy on this
important issue. I thank my colleagues
who have been speaking on the floor.
Madam Speaker, I have got to say,
this bill, like my colleague from North
Carolina just spoke of, is more of the
same. It is more of the same political
theater that we see day in and day out
in this body, where we refuse to actu-
ally address the issues of the day.
We have 100,000 people pouring across
the border of the United States per
month who are apprehended—100,000.
And then I watch with complete dis-
belief while my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle dare to complain about
how children are being housed, about
how people are being housed when we
don’t have the facilities to do it, and
they literally refuse to bring forward
legislation to fund dealing with the
problem.
I have never seen greater hypocrisy
in this body, and that is saying some-
thing pretty profound. I don’t know
how Members can look, with a straight
face, at the American people and say
that this House is actually addressing
this concern legitimately.
The Democrats are bringing forward
a bill, now, under the idea of taking
care of people who are here illegally—
who, by the way, were given status by
the President of the United States pre-
viously, illegally and unconstitution-
ally, as we proved in DAPA, which I
was proud to litigate on behalf of Texas
along with Attorney General Paxton,
Solicitor General Scott Keller, where
we won in the Fifth Circuit. We were
upheld in the Supreme Court for
DAPA, the DACA class was illegally
and unconstitutionally granted status.
It matters what we do here; it mat-
ters what the government does; it mat-
ters that we follow the rule of law; and
it matters that we not look at the
American people and claim to be, in
the false name of compassion, con-
cerned about the migrants coming here
when we have open borders that are ex-
ploiting these kids.
A little girl today is going to be
raped on the journey coming up
through Mexico while we pretend to
care. When are we going to do some-
thing about it?
If we actually care about the people
at the border right now, if we actually
care, why wouldn’t we fund beds right
now?
Why wouldn’t we fund immigration
judges right now?
Why wouldn’t we fix asylum laws
right now, not to prevent asylum, but
to match it up with the 88 percent who
are found to be fraudulently claiming
asylum once they go through the proc-
ess and immigration judges look at it?
Why wouldn’t we fix that problem
today?
Why are we empowering cartels to
profit to the tune of $2 billion in 2018
by moving human beings across our
border?
Why are we empowering 54 migrants
being stashed in a stash house in Hous-
ton, Texas, by the Reynosa faction of
the Gulf Cartel while we do nothing
about it, when we can?
We are the most powerful nation in
the history of the world. Why don’t we
go to our southern border and address
the problem rather than engaging in
the political theater of this ridiculous
bill?
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
am prepared to close, and I reserve the
balance of my time.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, may I
inquire how much time is remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Arizona has 9 minutes
remaining. The gentlewoman from
Florida has 16 minutes remaining.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
2 minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. WOODALL), my good friend.
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman from Arizona
(Mrs. LESKO), my colleague on the
Rules Committee, for yielding.
Madam Speaker, you heard my col-
league’s passion from this microphone
just seconds ago.
Lest anyone thinks this is about
money, this rule today combines two
bills: one, CBO estimates to cost $8 bil-
lion, not a penny for border security;
another, the CBO estimates to cost $26
billion, not a penny for border security.
Lest anyone thinks this conversation
today is about helping those young
people here under DACA protections,
remember, the Republican majority
brought two bills to the floor last year
that would do exactly that, got not one
Democratic vote on either one of them.
If anyone thinks this bill is about
protecting folks who are trying to
strive for the American Dream, Madam
Speaker, I would encourage you to read
from page 3 of the bill. It says:
This bill applies to an alien who is inad-
missible or deportable from the United
States, and those aliens only.
I tell you that, Madam Speaker, be-
cause I represent a constituency that is
25 percent first-generation Americans.
I represent a constituency that has
played by the rules, done everything
right, come to this country legally.
Their children are unprotected today,
and this bill does not one thing to pro-
tect those children. In order to qualify
for the protections in this bill, Madam
Speaker, people had to have come to
America the wrong way.
If people came to America the right
way and have been waiting in line for 5
years or 10 years or, in the case of my
constituents—and you know this well,
Madam Speaker—15 years, 20 years for
a green card while their children are
aging out of the system, this bill does
not one thing to protect them. Only if
people came the wrong way are there
protections in this system.
To be in the DACA program, people
had to get here before 2007. President
Obama’s crisis on the border came in
2014. This bill today not only grand-
fathers all the DACA kids, it grand-
fathers all of those kids. In the mean-
time, we have spent not one penny on
border security.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4242 June 4, 2019
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Georgia.
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I
am grateful to my colleague for yield-
ing the time.
Madam Speaker, we could be doing
something together today. My friend,
the chairwoman of the Immigration
and Citizenship Subcommittee of the
Committee on the Judiciary, has a bill
that has been cosponsored by more
than half of the Democrats and by
more than half of the Republicans that
would go directly to this issue of folks
who have been standing in line for dec-
ades and cannot get a green card. We
could be bringing that bill today. It has
not even gotten a hearing in the com-
mittee or the subcommittee so far.
This is not beyond our control. The
rabbi who prayed for us this morning,
Madam Speaker, said we can achieve
the unachievable. We absolutely can
come together and do that. This is not
a serious effort to do that today,
Madam Speaker, but it doesn’t have to
be the last word.
If we defeat this rule, we can come
back together with bills that have been
cosponsored by a majority of the Re-
publicans, a majority of the Demo-
crats, and move forward on this issue
together. I know that is what the
Speaker wants to do. I know that is
what the chairwoman of the Immigra-
tion and Citizenship Subcommittee
wants to do. I know that is what most
of us in this Chamber want to do, and
we can.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, you know I am from
the State of Arizona. Border security
and immigration has been the top issue
for years now, not only in my district,
but the entire State of Arizona, be-
cause we see it firsthand. We also see
the DACA recipients. I mean, they are
good kids, going to school, and I ap-
plaud the good and great DACA recipi-
ents that we have.
But what Representative WOODALL
says is true: Republicans offered two
bills to give legal status and one a
pathway to citizenship to DACA recipi-
ents, but this bill goes beyond DACA.
It is like DACA on steroids, because it
will allow millions more people to get
a special pathway to citizenship in
front of the line of other legal immi-
grants who are trying to do it the legal
way.
My colleagues on the other side of
the aisle know this is going nowhere in
the Senate and the President is not
going to do this. I hope at one point we
are actually going to work together,
because as Representative WOODALL
said, on those two bills that we put for-
ward last year that would have solved
the DACA problem, not one Democrat
voted for them.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD).
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam
Speaker, let me begin by thanking
Speaker PELOSI for making the Dream
and Promise Act one of the top 10
Democratic priorities for the people
and the Judiciary Committee for all
their hard work on this bill.
As coauthor of H.R. 6, I rise in strong
support of the rule and the Dream and
Promise Act. I will focus primarily on
the Dream portion of the bill.
Eighteen years ago, I was coauthor of
the original DREAM Act, known as the
Student Adjustment Act. Today’s vote
on H.R. 6 is a major milestone in a long
fight to protect Dreamers who are part
of the fabric of our American society.
This bill eliminates the fear of depor-
tation, which each day haunts 2.1 mil-
lion Dreamers at school, at work, and
as they care for their families.
I represent 24,000 Dreamers, the larg-
est number of Dreamers of any con-
gressional district. I think of these tal-
ented and patriotic Dreamers and the
barriers that they have overcome to
build lives and families in America, the
only country they call home. I think of
the courage that they have shown by
standing up and sharing their stories of
endurance, resourcefulness, sacrifice,
and heartbreak.
Dreamers exemplify American values
and what it means to pursue the Amer-
ican Dream.
I think of Dreamers like Yasmin,
who was raised in a mixed status fam-
ily and watched her father fight
against a serious illness. This experi-
ence inspired her to help others. She is
now studying to be a physician’s assist-
ant, serving patients like her father.
H.R. 6 will enable Dreamers like
Yasmin to reach their full potential,
contribute to their community, and
help ensure America is a stronger and
greater nation.
Dreamers like Yasmin are why
Democrats, Republicans, and Independ-
ents all support our Dreamers, as well
as businesses, organized labor, faith
groups, educators, health professionals,
and former Cabinet officials, among
others.
This broad and unprecedented coali-
tion of support highlights the fact that
this is not a partisan issue. This is
about who we are as Americans and
what is in the best interests of our
country.
Just like generations of immigrants
before them, these incredible young
people are vital to the well-being of our
Nation. According to the Center for
American Progress, each year, Dream-
ers contribute $17.3 billion in Federal
taxes and nearly $9.7 billion in State
and local taxes, and their households
have $75 billion in buying power.
Madam Speaker, we cannot afford to
lose the Dreamers’ talents and valuable
contributions to our country. Let’s
make the dream a reality once and for
all. I call on my colleagues to pass the
Dream and Promise Act today.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I
would inquire if my colleague has any
more speakers.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
have no further speakers.
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, again, Republicans,
too, want to have a DACA solution for
the DACA recipients, but this bill isn’t
it, because it goes way above the DACA
recipients and basically lets millions
more people in, people who could be
gang members, who have DUIs, and so
on and so forth.
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to provide for addi-
tional consideration of H.R. 3056 au-
thored by Representative ROGERS.
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous
consent to insert the text of my
amendment in the RECORD, along with
extraneous material, immediately
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Arizona?
There was no objection.
b 1345
Mrs. LESKO. H.R. 3056, the bill, pro-
vides $4.5 billion in funding to address
the immediate humanitarian crisis we
have on the southern border. It in-
cludes $3.3 billion for humanitarian as-
sistance, including shelter capacity for
unaccompanied children, care for chil-
dren in custody, and transportation for
safe and efficient border processing
centers.
It also includes $1.1 billion for oper-
ational support, including personnel,
transportation, and resources to com-
bat human trafficking and drug traf-
ficking—very serious issues.
It also includes $178 million for tech-
nology upgrades and law enforcement
pay adjustments to respond to this
great influx of families coming from
Central America to our border.
The Democrats today are waiving all
the rules to spend $35 billion on their,
I call, amnesty bill, but they have cho-
sen to ignore the humanitarian crisis
that is happening right now on our
southern border. H.R. 3056 takes steps
to resolve that problem.
Madam Speaker, in closing, it is crit-
ical that we develop and implement a
solution to the crisis at our southern
border immediately. I am from Ari-
zona. There is a crisis at our border. In-
stead, H.R. 6 is just another political
messaging bill because my colleagues
know it is not going anywhere.
Madam Speaker, I urge ‘‘no’’ on the
previous question, ‘‘no’’ on the under-
lying message, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself the balance of my time.
To my colleagues on the other side of
the aisle, I wish to remind them what
the President said after terminating
DACA and ending TPS for hundreds of
thousands of immigrants: ‘‘It is now
time for Congress to act.’’ And today,
we are acting.
We are in the midst of the longest
probationary period for citizenship and

permanent status in American history.
But today, we are finally providing real
solutions for Dreamers, TPS recipients,
and DED beneficiaries.
We are providing solutions for people
like Maria Moreno, who came to the
United States as a child and is a con-
stituent of mine. She is now a 22-year-
old anthropology student at Florida
International University and currently
working at HistoryMiami Museum.
She has spent her life focused on her
education. Now, as she pursues her ca-
reer as an anthropologist, she con-
tinues to find ways to make changes
within her community. She is a tutor
for local kids, empowering them to find
joy in learning.
To say that Maria is not worthy of
permanent legal status is cruel and un-
just. She is just as American as you
and I.
And Maria is just one of millions of
Dreamers who cherishes the American
Dream. They work hard and believe in
a country that has been shamefully
slow in recognizing their worth.
Despite all the hardship we have put
them through, like the newcomers be-
fore them, they still believe in our
country’s commitment to opportunity
and fairness.
Today, the Dreamers, Madam Speak-
er, are one step closer to getting their
dream. Today, the Dreamers, Madam
Speaker, are one House closer to get-
ting their dream.
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote
on the rule and the previous question.
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I rise in
strong opposition to H. Res. 415, a rule pro-
viding for House consideration of H.R. 6, the
American Dream and Promise Act of 2019.
According to the Congressional Budget Of-
fice (CBO), H.R. 6 increases the deficit by at
least $30 billion over ten years. CBO indicates
that this is additional mandatory spending.
Under current projections, mandatory spend-
ing is set to increase from 69 percent to 78
percent of the federal budget over the next
decade. Adding to this already unsustainable
projected growth, mandatory spending threat-
ens to crowd out necessary spending on de-
fense, homeland security, veterans, infrastruc-
ture, public health, education, and other dis-
cretionary priorities. Absent the waiver made
by this rule, H.R. 6 would be vulnerable to a
PAYGO point of order.
The rule providing for consideration of H.R.
6 waives all points of order against the bill, in-
cluding clause 10 of rule XXI, the House
PAYGO, or ‘‘Pay-As-You-Go,’’ rule, which re-
quires any legislation increasing the deficit to
be offset with spending cuts or tax increases.
Unsurprisingly, this rule was met with strong
objections at the start of the 116th Congress
by many progressive lawmakers who viewed
PAYGO as an impediment to costly proposals
such as the ‘‘Green New Deal’’ and ‘‘Medi-
care-for-All,’’ which is projected to cost at least
$32 trillion on top of what the federal govern-
ment is already spending. After much debate,
the PAYGO rule was adopted by the new
House majority on January 3, the first day of
the 116th Congress. Immediately after this
new House rule was adopted, a number of
stories circulated in the press indicating that
my colleagues in the Democratic Leadership
intended to waive the PAYGO rule any time
they needed to. In a sign of more division on
that side of the aisle, Democrats introduced
bills to repeal the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go
Act, even though they had just voted for
PAYGO in the House rules package.
From a budget enforcement perspective, it’s
clear Democrats continue to circumvent their
own rules. l hope this waiver does not con-
tinue the practice that the House PAYGO rule
will be waived by the House Rules Committee
whenever a bill is non-compliant, feels incon-
venient, or stands in the way of advancing
their costly agenda.
I oppose the rule for H.R. 6, since it enables
a fiscally irresponsible bill to move forward
without following House rules. Budget enforce-
ment should be an important priority of the
House Budget Committee. I hope the House
will limit the extent to which future legislation
increases already unsustainable budget defi-
cits.
The material previously referred to
by Mrs. LESKO is as follows:
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 415
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing:
SEC. 2. That immediately upon adoption of
this resolution, the House shall resolve into
the Committee of the Whole House on the
state of the Union for consideration of the
bill (H.R. 3056) to provide supplemental ap-
propriations relating to border security, and
for other purposes. The first reading of the
bill shall be dispensed with. All points of
order against consideration of the bill are
waived. General debate shall be confined to
the bill and shall not exceed one hour equal-
ly divided and controlled by the chair and
ranking minority member of the Committee
on Appropriations. After general debate the
bill shall be considered for amendment under
the five-minute rule. Points of order against
provisions in the bill for failure to comply
with clause 2 of rule XXI are waived. Clause
2(e) of rule XXI shall not apply during con-
sideration of the bill. When the committee
rises and reports the bill back to the House
with a recommendation that the bill do pass,
the previous question shall be considered as
ordered on the bill and amendments thereto
to final passage without intervening motion
except one motion to recommit with or with-
out instructions. If the Committee of the
Whole rises and reports that it has come to
no resolution on the bill, then on the next
legislative day the House shall, immediately
after the third daily order of business under
clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Com-
mittee of the Whole for further consideration
of the bill.
SEC. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not
apply to the consideration of H.R. 3056.
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I
yield back the balance of my time, and
I move the previous question on the
resolution.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on ordering the previous
question.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the ayes appeared to have it.

that I demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 15-
minute vote on ordering the previous
question will be followed by 5-minute
votes on:
Agreeing to House Resolution 415, if
ordered; and
Agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of
the Journal.

vice, and there were—yeas 228, nays

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 962,
BORN-ALIVE ABORTION SUR-
VIVORS PROTECTION ACT
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged
from further consideration of H.R. 962,
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Pro-
tection Act. This legislation will help
the most vulnerable human beings in
our society, and I ask for its immediate
consideration in the House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
CLARKE of New York). Under the guide-
lines consistently issued by successive
Speakers, as recorded in section 956 of
the House Rules and Manual, the Chair
is constrained not to entertain the re-
quest unless it has been cleared by the
bipartisan floor and committee leader-
ships.
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, if this
unanimous consent cannot be enter-
tained, I urge the Speaker and the ma-
jority leader to immediately schedule
the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Pro-
tection Act, so we can stand up and
protect the sanctity of human life, and
I would ask all others to join in that
request.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is not recognized for debate.

GENERAL LEAVE
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 1379.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California?
There was no objection.
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of
this bipartisan legislation, the Pan-
demic and All-Hazards Preparedness
and Advancing Innovation Act, fondly
called PAHPA, so that is the way I am
going to refer to it.
In January of this year, the House
passed a version of this legislation by a
vote of 401–17. It was the first suspen-
sion that was considered in this new
Congress, and so I am really very, very
pleased that the Senate finally took up
this critical legislation and sent it
back to the House for us to consider
once again.
The bill strips out an unrelated issue
that the Senate had to struggle with,
and it simply includes the public
health emergency and response legisla-
tion that my wonderful partner, Rep-
resentative SUSAN BROOKS, and I have
worked on for over a year. Imagine how
relieved we are and thrilled we are to
be on the floor today with this. Our
legislation reflects months of negotia-
tions and compromise reached by the
House and Senate.
We know the importance of the bill
we are considering today, and it actu-
ally is critical to our national security.
In 2001, our country endured the hor-
rific attacks on September 11 and the
anthrax attacks that followed shortly
thereafter. Congress realized at that
time that our country was not prepared
to coordinate responses to mass cas-
ualty events or chemical attacks, and
it is why I wrote the legislation with
then-Representative RICHARD BURR to
address these shortfalls. This bill up-
dates that original legislation by di-
recting Federal agencies to respond to
new and emerging threats and also
strengthen our Nation’s existing pre-
paredness and response programs.
This bill reauthorizes critical pro-
grams that ensure our Nation is pre-
pared to respond to naturally occurring
and manmade disasters. Events over
the past few years—the ongoing mea-
sles outbreak, destructive wildfires and
hurricanes, and the reemergence of
Ebola—as well as the constant looming
threat of a biological attack by an-
other nation or a hostile state enemy
underscore the importance of this leg-
islation.
These threats are real, and our coun-
try must be prepared to adequately re-
spond to them. Our experience with
each one of those hazards reminds us
that our country is not yet adequately
prepared to deal with potentially dev-
astating, widespread public health cri-
ses. That is why this legislation is so
critical, and this reauthorization meets
the challenges that we face today and
those we anticipate facing in the fu-
ture.
The bill provides the authorization
and Federal resources to invest in pro-
grams that allow the Biomedical Ad-
vanced Research and Development Au-
thority, or BARDA, to develop medical
countermeasures for use after a public
health emergency and to address anti-
microbial resistance. PAHPA-I reau-
thorizes the HHS National Advisory
Committee on Children and Disasters
and also authorizes the Children’s Pre-
paredness Unit at the CDC.
It also establishes an advisory coun-
cil for people with disabilities and an
advisory council on seniors to focus on
the needs of these special populations
during a public health emergency.
b 1445
It also, very importantly, includes a
proposal to prioritize bringing nursing
homes back onto the power grid at the
same time as hospitals after a disaster,
and it includes provisions related to re-
gional health partnerships, pregnant
and postpartum women, and environ-
mental health.
PAHPA expired last September 30—
that is, September 30 of 2018—so reau-
thorizing these programs is imperative
to our national security.
Madam Speaker, I am proud of the
legislation. I urge my colleagues to
once again vote for it.
I have said this many times, but it is
worth restating again: I salute and
couldn’t have had a better, more dedi-
cated partner in this effort than Con-
gresswoman SUSAN BROOKS. We look
forward to the bill going directly to the
President’s desk and being signed into
law so we can get to work on other
things.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4263
June 4, 2019
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the Pandemic and All-Hazards
Preparedness and Advancing Innova-
tion Act of 2019, or PAHPA.
I am proud to have worked with my
dear friend and colleague from Cali-
fornia, Representative ESHOO, who was
one of the original authors and a leader
in the 2006 PAHPA bill and the lead au-
thor of the last reauthorization in 2013.
Along with Representative ESHOO,
this work would not have been done
without Chairman PALLONE, Ranking
Member WALDEN, and Representative
Dr. BURGESS. We have worked closely
with Senators BURR, ALEXANDER,
CASEY, and MURRAY to craft this reau-
thorization of PAHPA.
PAHPA is a bipartisan public health
and national security effort to ensure
our Nation is better prepared to re-
spond to public health emergencies re-
sulting from chemical, biological, radi-
ological, or nuclear attacks, whether it
be from a terrorist group or nation-
state, a natural disaster or emerging
infectious diseases.
I was the United States attorney for
the Southern District of Indiana during
the 2001 anthrax attacks. In September
of ‘01, shortly after 9/11, the anthrax at-
tacks infected more than 17 people and
killed 5.
Not only was Congress a target, with
letters containing anthrax spores sent
to Senators Daschle and Leahy, but
even my own U.S. attorney’s office in
Indiana dealt with a hoax when we re-
ceived a letter with powder inside.
It was a scary time because those
types of letters were sent all across the
country. It was a very scary time for
our Nation, the hoaxes that I and oth-
ers received, but it helped illustrate
the importance of having accurate
diagnostics.
In the 18 years since then, these
types of threats—the actual threats of
chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear—continue to grow. In fact,
every day, our adversaries are looking
for more effective and faster ways to
produce a threat. It is not a question of
if we will face a threat; it is a question
of when.
People may not realize, but a single
gallon of concentrated anthrax can
contain enough spores to kill every in-
dividual on the planet.
According to a 2017 report from the
Harvard Kennedy School, the Belfer
Center for Science and International
Affairs, in 2015, the North Korean State
media released a series of photographs
of the Pyongyang Biotechnical Insti-
tute. The photos revealed that North
Korea could produce military-sized
batches of biological weapons—specifi-
cally, anthrax—at this facility.
North Korea is believed to have
started a biological weapons program
in the sixties and is now assumed to
have several pathogens in possession.
Smallpox is highly contagious, and
individuals remain contagious until
that last smallpox scab falls off. Un-
treated smallpox is twice as contagious
as the flu and more than three times as
deadly, potentially killing every third
person infected.
But, thanks to PAHPA and the work
of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee with the 21st Century Cures
Act, we are more prepared for biologi-
cal threats and attacks. Last year, the
FDA approved the first drug ever to
treat smallpox and approved an
autoinjector which provides that one-
time dose of an antidote to block the
effects of nerve agents. The approval of
TPOXX and Seizalam will help protect
Americans from biological attacks.
But the threats we are facing are not
hypothetical. The ongoing Ebola out-
break—and it is ongoing—is now the
second largest outbreak in history.
Since August of 2018, more than 1,000
people in the DRC, Democratic Repub-
lic of the Congo, have died from Ebola.
More than 2,000 cases have been re-
ported, with 14 new, confirmed cases
just within the last week.
We also know that Zika virus con-
tinues to be a threat. The majority of
people infected with Zika don’t develop
symptoms, but the Zika infection dur-
ing pregnancy can cause horrible con-
genital abnormalities. Eighty-six coun-
tries have reported evidence of mos-
quito-transmitted Zika.
I share this because of the threats
like Ebola and Zika. Reauthorizing and
increasing funding for the BioShield
Special Reserve Fund and BARDA, the
Biomedical Advanced Research and De-
velopment Authority, are critically
important.
PAHPA increases funding for BARDA
from $2.8 billion to $7.1 billion over 10
years because BARDA’s work over the
last decade has resulted in FDA ap-
provals of more than 42 different med-
ical countermeasures.
Development of medical counter-
measures is lengthy. It is a risky en-
deavor. It is why sending a clear signal
that BARDA remains a strong and
committed partner with academic in-
stitutions and the private sector in
these efforts is so important.
So, while the investments BARDA is
making into innovative research and
new treatments are critical, it is also
important that we continue to address
the threats that have been around for
years.
In 1918, the pandemic influenza killed
about 20 to 50 million people around
the globe, including 675,000 people here
in the United States. Experts predict
we are due for another global pandemic
influenza.
Research funded by BARDA has al-
ready significantly expanded our do-
mestic vaccine production capability,
and the bill we are considering today
will authorize $250 million more for the
Assistant Secretary for Preparedness
and Response, or the ASPR, to address
threats like pandemic influenza.
Specifically, PAHPA directs the
ASPR to work to increase manufac-
turing capacity and stockpile these
medical countermeasures. While the
PAHPA bill we are considering today
authorizes funding for research into
known threats like pan flu, it main-
tains the flexibility that is the founda-
tion of our medical countermeasure en-
terprise to deal with the unknown
threats for which we may have no de-
fense.
PAHPA also improves State and
local public health security by reau-
thorizing the National Disaster Med-
ical System so that we have the needed
workforce, the experts in the work-
force, when facing a public health
emergency like we currently face right
now with 981 measle cases across 26
States.
The current number of measles cases
is the highest number of cases in the
United States in nearly three decades,
with just 41 new cases reported last
week. So this allows the ASPR to reas-
sign and move health professionals dur-
ing public health emergencies.
PAHPA also ensures a coordinated
healthcare response to natural disas-
ters. The many hurricanes—Florence,
Harvey, Irma, Jose, and Maria—killed
hundreds of Americans and showed us
we have to do better to prioritize the
needs of every person in our commu-
nity. PAHPA does that by prioritizing
our most vulnerable populations: chil-
dren, seniors, and people with disabil-
ities.
We can’t forget about the volunteers
who work to save lives in the wake of
natural disasters. In addition to Good
Samaritan provisions within PAHPA
that will provide new liability protec-
tions for medical professionals who
volunteer after a disaster, this bill also
ensures that more healthcare profes-
sionals, like nurses and doctors, can be
hired and trained when facing a public
health crisis by strengthening our Na-
tional Disaster Medical System.
And, very importantly, it ensures we
have a robust supply of vaccines; basic
equipment like gloves, Hazmat suits,
and masks; and more in our strategic
national stockpile located all across
the country so that these professionals
have the equipment and the tools that
they need.
Finally, PAHPA includes provisions
from the Subcommittee on Health
Ranking Member BURGESS’ MISSION
ZERO bill. Today will be the fifth time
the House has passed these provisions
that authorize grants to trauma cen-
ters to enable military trauma teams
to provide care at our centers.
These important provisions will inte-
grate military trauma providers into
trainings and drills for public health
emergencies to not only allow civilians
the chance to learn about the mili-
tary’s best practices, but give our mili-
tary trauma care providers the oppor-
tunity to use their cutting-edge exper-
tise without leaving the military.
This public health, national security
bill is the result of months of work,
and I want to commend the Energy and
Commerce staff on both sides of the
aisle and, particularly, our staffs—
Catherine Knowles and Rachel Fybel—
for their tireless work in ensuring that
this got through both the House and
the Senate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4264 June 4, 2019
Madam Speaker, I cannot emphasize
enough how important it is to reau-
thorize PAHPA. I urge all Members to
support this piece of critical legisla-
tion, and I reserve the balance of my
time.
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. WALDEN),
ranking member of the Committee on
Energy and Commerce. He had been
chair at one time, when it passed one
time out of the House, but now is rank-
ing. I want to thank him so much for
his work.
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I
thank both my friend from California
and my friend from Indiana, who really
did amazing work on this legislation—
not once, but twice, and probably a few
times in between—to get it to this
point.
I am delighted to stand on this House
floor once again and support PAHPA,
the Pandemic and All-Hazards Pre-
paredness and Advancing Innovation
Act.
This is really important. I think my
colleagues have spoken of the specific
reasons that we can talk about here on
the House floor. In the classified set-
tings that we have had, we all know
how serious this threat is and how im-
portant it is for us to work together to
address it, and we have done that in
the last Congress and now in this Con-
gress.
So, I want to thank my friend Mr.
PALLONE, who chairs the committee
now, for continuing this effort to ad-
vance this bill forward, and especially
thank Representatives BROOKS and
ESHOO for their tireless work to really
get this across the finish line.
PAHPA does enable critical partner-
ships between the Federal Government
and State and local authorities and the
private sector. This will help ensure
that our country is responsibly pre-
pared for and able to respond to public
health emergencies.
It is not a matter of if, as everyone
said already, but when the next pan-
demic or emergency will strike. From
pandemic flu to cybersecurity inci-
dents, our government agencies at all
levels must have the tools to respond
to these threats, and we must make
sure they have them.
In my own State of Oregon, we face a
constant threat from wildfires, floods,
air quality issues, and other things.
But we also have begun to prepare for
what we are told will be a devastating
earthquake at some point, known as
Cascadia, which could take thousands
of lives in Oregon and leave behind tens
of billions of dollars worth of damage
and disable our major airport, take
down bridges. Basically, everybody on
the west side of the State would have
to come over to the east side. This is
predicted. Earthquakes have happened
before; recorded history shows it; and
we are overdue.
So this is the kind of legislation that
would help. It would make sure that
they can put a pallet load of the right
drugs and medicines on a plane and get
it right there, and they will have a sys-
tem all ready to distribute that. That
is just one of many things that this
legislation accomplishes.
Sending this to the President’s desk
is long overdue. I am glad we are going
to have this vote today. Our govern-
ment officials need these tools at their
disposal, and I thank my colleagues for
the terrific work they have done to get
us to this point.
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER), a
fellow Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee member, the only pharmacist in
Congress, who knows more about these
issues than most. I appreciate his part-
nership and work on this important
piece of legislation.
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for
yielding.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the Pandemic and All-Hazards
Preparedness and Advancing Innova-
tion Act, also known as PAHPA.
It is a good thing we are here to vote
on this bill today, but the work on this
issue has been going on for a while.
We held reauthorization hearings in
the Energy and Commerce Committee
in June of last year and were able to
pass the bill through the committee
and out of the House shortly there-
after.
We again passed PAHPA in January,
which has continued to be championed
by my good friend Mrs. BROOKS of Indi-
ana.
PAHPA is important legislation that
will improve our Nation’s public
health, medical preparedness, and re-
sponse capabilities for emergencies.
Whether it is a natural disaster, an ac-
cidental catastrophe, or a deliberate
act of terror, it is the contents of this
bill that will keep Americans safe.
This bill will upgrade our prepared-
ness by boosting our domestic biologi-
cal surveillance systems and help up-
grade our medical countermeasures.
This bill also takes a particular look
at how we address antimicrobial resist-
ance so we can help protect future gen-
erations from the threat of widespread
pandemic.
b 1500
Living on the Georgia coast, my dis-
trict understands the threat of natural
disasters in the form of hurricanes all
too well. This bill improves our dis-
aster response coordination, so we min-
imize the human toll of these deadly
storms.
Since funding expired on September
30th of last year, the House has voted
multiple times to reauthorize PAHPA.
I look forward to President Trump
signing this vital, lifesaving legislation
into law.
I urge my colleagues to support this
legislation.
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam
Speaker, I am prepared to close.
I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Madam Speaker, I appreciate my col-
leagues for speaking out and their sup-
port of this important legislation.
The provisions in PAHPA we are re-
authorizing today do complement the
National Biodefense Strategy the ad-
ministration released last fall, and it
will ensure that our Nation is better
prepared. The administration’s Na-
tional Biodefense Strategy is designed
to improve the coordination and com-
munication between agencies, so the
United States is better protected
against naturally-occurring threats, or
whether they might be deliberate at-
tacks.
Again, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this critical piece of legislation. It
would not have been possible but for
the incredible partnership of Congress-
woman ESHOO and the leadership that
she and her office and the Energy and
Commerce Committee has dem-
onstrated in this very important piece
of public health and national security
legislation.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
I would just like to make a few com-
ments in closing because I don’t have
any more speakers and assert my right
to close last.
I think every good word that could be
said about this legislation has already
been stated, so I want to urge all of my
colleagues to vote ‘‘aye’’ on this. It is
legislation that has been scrutinized
and re-scrutinized, and even though it
has taken time and gone past its reau-
thorization date, that makes it all the
more important that it be passed be-
cause the agencies really cannot do
what we have been describing, and this
has gone on since last October.
I think that the bookends on this are
national security and public health
preparedness for manmade disasters
and others, and neither one of these
can be addressed by any individual.
This has to be done by us on behalf of
our country.
So I want to thank Catherine
Knowles for her very fine work in
working with Rachel Fybel from my of-
fice. We really pay tribute to you be-
cause they have worked so hard every
single day, not just for weeks, not just
for months, but well over a year to get
us to this point.
I urge all colleagues to support this
legislation. We are proud to rec-
ommend it to them.
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time,
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise
in strong support of S. 1379, the ‘‘Pandemic
and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing
Innovation Act of 2019’’ (PAHPAI), which in-
creases our essential efforts to ensure the
United States is prepared to respond to na-
tional disasters and crises.
After the horrific terrorist attacks of Sep-
tember 11, 2001 and the preceding anthrax at-
tacks, Congress recognized that the United

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4265
June 4, 2019
States was underprepared to respond to pub-
lic health emergencies and national disasters
and passed the original Pandemic and All-
Hazards Preparedness Act, Pub. L. 109–417
to address this weakness.
PAHPAI was reauthorized in 2013, but in re-
cent years, the threats to our country have
changed, and PAHPAI must be updated to en-
sure that we are prepared to respond to in-
creasing natural disasters, emerging infectious
diseases, and chemical, biological, and nu-
clear attacks.
S. 1379 has been adapted to meet the
mounting challenges that face us today and
those that will face our children tomorrow.
As a biodefense bill, PAHPAI will further
protect our country from internal and external
terrorists.
As a health care response bill, PAHPAI cre-
ates and ensures coordinated healthcare ef-
forts in the face of natural disasters such as
hurricanes.
This bill also addresses the nation’s need
for pandemic preparedness.
Texas has experienced pandemics first
hand—with the first diagnosed case of Ebola
in the United States in 2014.
Thomas Eric Duncan after traveling from Af-
rica to visit family members in Dallas, Texas
became ill.
He went to Texas Health Presbyterian Hos-
pital Dallas for care but was not admitted after
presenting with a 103-degree temperature,
and Ebola symptoms.
At the time the CDC had alerted all doctors,
hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies with alerts
to screen all patients for Ebola symptoms.
Mr. Duncan’s Ebola symptoms worsened
over the days following his visit to Texas
Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, and he
returned by ambulance to the hospital and
only then was he finally admitted for treat-
ment.
By that time his condition had worsened,
and Mr. Duncan died from Ebola.
His death was a tragedy and the two nurses
who were infected while trying to care for him
are heroes.
Two years later, in 2016, the Zika Virus
pandemic reached Texas carried by mosqui-
toes.
This disease attacked babies while devel-
oping in their mother’s womb, which destroyed
brain tissue, resulting in severe brain and cra-
nial deformities.
Houston, Texas, has a tropical climate with
many climatic similarities with other states
along the Gulf Coast, parts of Central and
South America as well as the Caribbean.
Tropical climates are hospitable to mosquitoes
that carry the Zika Virus.
I have shared concerns among Federal,
state, and local agency officials regarding a
need to have a plan to address future
pandemics our nation may face.
This bill will pave the way for much needed
work in pandemic preparedness.
PAHPAI will ensure that more health care
professionals can be hired and trained to
prioritize vulnerable populations such as chil-
dren, the elderly, and people with disabilities.
To incentivize and protect practitioners, this
bill will also provide health care professionals
who volunteer after natural disasters with li-
ability coverage.
To support disaster workers and devastated
communities, PAHPAI will also ensure the
availability of health care supplies by stocking
the Strategic National Stockpiles, located
across the United States, with vaccines,
gloves, masks, and more.
PAHPAI also renews and increases funding
to the BioShield Special Reserve Fund and
Biomedical Advanced Research and Develop-
ment Authority (BARDA), which is invaluable
to our response capabilities.
S. 1379 is essential to ensuring that the
United States is prepared to provide quality
care to those in need after devastating events.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in supporting S. 1379 to establish and
strengthen the nation’s emergency prepared-
ness in the face of health crises and national
disasters.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion offered by
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.
ESHOO) that the House suspend the
rules and pass the bill, S. 1379.
The question was taken; and (two-
thirds being in the affirmative) the
rules were suspended and the bill was
passed.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.

simple possession of cannabis or cannabis-re-
lated paraphernalia, any offense involving can-
nabis or cannabis-related paraphernalia which
is no longer prosecutable in the State in which
the conviction was entered, and any offense in-
volving civil disobedience without violence) not
occurring on the same date, and not arising out
of the same act, omission, or scheme of mis-
conduct; or
(iii) a misdemeanor offense of domestic vio-
lence, unless the alien demonstrates that such

212(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act
(8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)), unless the conviction form-
ing the basis for inadmissibility would otherwise
render the alien ineligible under paragraph
(1)(B) (subject to subparagraph (B)); and
(B) for purposes of clauses (ii) and (iii) of
paragraph (1)(B), waive consideration of—
(i) one misdemeanor offense if the alien has
not been convicted of any offense in the 5-year
period preceding the date on which the alien ap-
plies for adjustment of status under this title; or
(ii) up to two misdemeanor offenses if the
alien has not been convicted of any offense in

this title.
(3) AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT SECONDARY RE-
VIEW.—
(A) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding an alien’s
eligibility for adjustment of status under this
title, and subject to the procedures described in
this paragraph, the Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity may, as a matter of non-delegable discre-
tion, provisionally deny an application for ad-
justment of status (whether on a conditional
basis or without the conditional basis as pro-
vided in section 113(c)(2)) if the Secretary, based
on clear and convincing evidence, which shall
include credible law enforcement information,
determines that the alien is described in sub-
paragraph (B) or (D).
(B) PUBLIC SAFETY.—An alien is described in
this subparagraph if—
(i) excluding simple possession of cannabis or
cannabis-related paraphernalia, any offense in-
volving cannabis or cannabis-related para-
phernalia which is no longer prosecutable in the
State in which the conviction was entered, any
offense under State law for which an essential
element is the alien’s immigration status, any
offense involving civil disobedience without vio-
lence, and any minor traffic offense, the alien—
(I) has been convicted of a misdemeanor of-
fense punishable by a term of imprisonment of
more than 30 days; or
(II) has been adjudicated delinquent in a
State or local juvenile court proceeding that re-
sulted in a disposition ordering placement in a
secure facility; and
(ii) the alien poses a significant and con-
tinuing threat to public safety related to such
conviction or adjudication.
(C) PUBLIC SAFETY DETERMINATION.—For pur-
poses of subparagraph (B)(ii), the Secretary
shall consider the recency of the conviction or
adjudication; the length of any imposed sen-
tence or placement; the nature and seriousness
of the conviction or adjudication, including
whether the elements of the offense include the
unlawful possession or use of a deadly weapon
to commit an offense or other conduct intended
to cause serious bodily injury; and any miti-
gating factors pertaining to the alien’s role in
the commission of the offense.
(D) GANG PARTICIPATION.—An alien is de-
scribed in this subparagraph if the alien has,
within the 5 years immediately preceding the
date of the application, knowingly, willfully,
and voluntarily participated in offenses com-

to provide such biometric or biographic data be-
cause of a physical impairment.
(b) BACKGROUND CHECKS.—The Secretary

that would render the alien ineligible for adjust-

ditional or permanent basis. The status of an
alien may not be adjusted, on either a condi-
tional or permanent basis, unless security and

has been permitted to depart voluntarily from
the United States may, notwithstanding such

not be required to file a separate motion to re-
open, reconsider, or vacate the order of removal.
If the Secretary approves the application, the
Secretary shall cancel the order of removal. If
the Secretary renders a final administrative de-
cision to deny the application, the order of re-
moval or permission to depart shall be effective

empted from paying an application fee required
under this title if the applicant—

ginning on the date on which an alien applies
for adjustment of status under this title and
ending on the date on which the Secretary
makes a final decision regarding such applica-

days, unless the alien establishes to the satisfac-
tion of the Secretary of Homeland Security that
the alien did not in fact abandon residence in
the United States during such period.
(2) EXTENSIONS FOR EXTENUATING CIR-
CUMSTANCES.—The Secretary may extend the
time periods described in paragraph (1) for an
alien who demonstrates that the failure to time-
ly return to the United States was due to ex-
tenuating circumstances beyond the alien’s con-
trol, including the serious illness of the alien, or
death or serious illness of a parent, grand-
parent, sibling, or child of the alien.
(3) TRAVEL AUTHORIZED BY THE SECRETARY.—

spect to aliens who were removed or departed

as a matter of discretion, waive the physical
presence requirement under section 111(b)(1)(A)
for humanitarian purposes, for family unity, or
because a waiver is otherwise in the public in-
terest. The Secretary, in consultation with the
Secretary of State, shall establish a procedure
for such aliens to apply for relief under section

have been eligible for relief under such section,

ocation of such status.

district court.
(c) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF A PROVISIONAL DE-
NIAL.—

alien shall have 60 days from the date of the
Secretary’s determination to seek review of such
determination in an appropriate United States
district court.
(2) SCOPE OF REVIEW AND DECISION.—Notwith-
standing any other provision of law, review
under paragraph (1) shall be de novo and based
solely on the administrative record, except that
the applicant shall be given the opportunity to
supplement the administrative record and the
Secretary shall be given the opportunity to rebut
the evidence and arguments raised in such sub-
mission. Upon issuing its decision, the court
shall remand the matter, with appropriate in-
structions, to the Department of Homeland Se-

tion.

cial review if such removal is based on criminal

of status under this title, or to revoke such sta-
tus, is reversed.

this title shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to apply for such relief and may not be removed
until, subject to section 226(c), a final decision
establishing ineligibility for relief is rendered.
(b) APPLICATION.—An alien present in the
United States who has been ordered removed or
has been permitted to depart voluntarily from
the United States may, notwithstanding such

ment of status under this title. Such alien shall

graph (2), subparagraphs (D) through (G) of
paragraph (6), or paragraph (10)(D) of section
212(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8
U.S.C. 1182(a)) for humanitarian purposes, for
family unity, or because the waiver is otherwise
in the public interest.
(2) EXCEPTION.—The Secretary may not waive
a ground described in paragraph (1) if such in-
admissibility is based on a conviction or convic-
tions, and such conviction or convictions would
otherwise render the alien ineligible under sec-

ality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a(c)(2)(B)).

ods, in the aggregate, exceeding 180 days.
(2) EXTENSIONS FOR EXTENUATING CIR-
CUMSTANCES.—The Secretary may extend the
time periods described in paragraph (1) for an

trol, including the serious illness of the alien, or
death or serious illness of a parent, grand-
parent, sibling, or child of the alien.
(3) TRAVEL AUTHORIZED BY THE SECRETARY.—

application for adjustment of status, or a rev-
ocation of such status.

other provision of law, an alien may seek judi-
cial review of a denial of an application for ad-

alien described in paragraph (1) pending judi-
cial review if such removal is based on criminal
or national security grounds. Such removal does

GENERAL LEAVE
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask
unanimous consent that all Members
may have 5 legislative days in which to
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 6.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?
There was no objection.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield myself 4 minutes.
Madam Speaker, H.R. 6, the Amer-
ican Dream and Promise Act of 2019, is
vital legislation that provides a path to
lawful permanent resident, or LPR,
status for two groups of people who en-
rich our Nation and who are in dire
need of protection, Dreamers, and long-
term recipients of humanitarian relief,
known as Temporary Protected Status,
or TPS, and Deferred Enforcement De-
parture, or DED.
Dreamers are undocumented immi-
grants who came to the United States
as children and have embraced this
country as their own. They are our
neighbors and coworkers; they are the
classmates of our children; and they
serve in our military with distinction.
Many did not even know they were not
born here and were not American citi-
zens until they found they could not
get drivers licenses or in-state tuition
rates for college.
That is why it was so devastating
when the Trump administration an-
nounced that it was ending the De-
ferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,
also known as DACA, which enabled
approximately 800,000 Dreamers to
work lawfully, attend school, and plan
their lives without the constant threat
of deportation.
Although less is known or understood
about long-time TPS and DED recipi-
ents, there is no doubt that they are
equally deserving of our protection and
support. Broadly speaking, TPS and
DED provide humanitarian relief to in-
dividuals from countries facing dan-
gerous conditions or experiencing up-
heaval, such as ongoing armed conflict,
natural disasters, or other extraor-
dinary conditions.
TPS and DED recipients have lived in
the United States, on average, for dec-
ades, laying down deep roots in our
communities. They also contribute to
the U.S. economy by making up a sig-
nificant portion of the workforce in
key industries, including construction
and food service, as well as through
consumer spending and tax revenue.
Unfortunately, like Dreamers, their
futures now hang in the balance as a
result of the Trump administration’s
anti-immigrant, enforcement-only ap-
proach to immigration policy. Since
September 2017, the administration has
announced the termination of TPS and
DED for seven affected countries.
Fortunately, the courts have issued
multiple injunctions preventing efforts
to terminate DACA and TPS from mov-
ing forward. But even if the courts ulti-
mately rule against the administra-
tion, only a fraction of Dreamers and
TPS recipients will benefit from a re-
prieve that is itself only temporary.
That is why we must pass H.R. 6 today
to provide Dreamers and TPS recipi-
ents the permanent protections they
need and deserve.
The American Dream and Promise
Act is carefully crafted legislation that
delivers needed protections, while cre-
ating rigorous eligibility standards, in-
cluding specifically restricting eligi-
bility to those individuals who pose no
public safety or national security con-
cerns.
I want to congratulate my col-
leagues, Representatives LUCILLE ROY-
BAL-ALLARD, NYDIA VELÁZQUEZ, and
you, Madam Speaker, YVETTE CLARKE,
for introducing this important legisla-
tion.
I would also like to thank the distin-

migration Subcommittee, Representa-
tives ZOE LOFGREN and PRAMILA

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4273
June 4, 2019
the Dreamer and TPS/DED popu-
lations, and their tireless efforts, have
been essential in bringing this bill to
the floor today.
Dreamers and TPS and DED recipi-
ents contribute to our thriving econ-
omy, and they make America a strong-
er, more united, and more diverse na-
tion. Failing to provide permanent pro-
tections for them at this critical junc-
ture would be a travesty, not only for
these individuals, but also for us as a
country.
I hope that all of my colleagues will
stand up for these vital members of our
society when it truly counts by sup-
porting H.R. 6 today.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
may consume.
I rise today in opposition to H.R. 6,
the American Dream and Promise Act
of 2019.
Last week, I went to El Paso to see
what was going on on our southern bor-
der. I can tell my colleagues today that
our border is an utter disaster.
Last month, Customs and Border
Protection apprehended an average of
4,500 people every day. During the first
7 months of the fiscal year, CBP has
apprehended more individuals than in
any full fiscal year since 2009.
While I was in El Paso, a single group
of more than 1,000 aliens illegally
walked across the border from Juarez.
A group of migrants the size of a high
school strolled right into downtown El
Paso and surrendered to Border Patrol.
I personally witnessed hundreds of oth-
ers in smaller groups do the same
thing.
The number of family unit members
and unaccompanied alien minors ap-
prehended in April set records, and
May numbers eclipsed those records.
The number of single-adult apprehen-
sions has now reached a 5-year high.
So far this year, Border Patrol has
encountered over 180 large groups,
those with over 100 people. With so
many people entering illegally, it is no
wonder Border Patrol processing cen-
ters are far beyond capacity and ICE
detention facilities are full.
Even the NGOs providing shelter and
other aid to migrants are completely
overwhelmed by the unending surge of
people who have learned we are reward-
ing those who break our laws and en-
dangering vulnerable men, women, and
children in the process.
Perhaps the worst part of this hu-
manitarian crisis is the toll it takes on
children. CBP has identified over 3,000
potentially fraudulent family units ar-
riving at the border. As unbelievable as
it may sound, aliens admitted that
they have ‘‘borrowed,’’ ‘‘rented,’’ or
‘‘bought,’’ yes, ‘‘bought’’ a child be-
cause they know showing up with a
child at the border all but guarantees
release into America’s interior.
It is a crisis. One of the overworked,
overwhelmed agents that I met last
week told me, after I thanked him for
doing his work and being there, he
looked at me and he said: ‘‘I’m doing
my job; now y’all go do yours.’’
I took that to heart. I believe that
the surge of migrants can be all but
ended by enacting a legislation to fix
the Flores settlement, which the
Obama administration agreed with me
on; amend the Trafficking Victims
Protection Act and raise the credible
fear standard of asylum.
But what are my Democratic col-
leagues going to do to address this sit-
uation? Nothing.
Democrats have the chance to help
the overworked DHS heroes, over-
whelmed NGOs, and the American peo-
ple who believe in our country’s sov-
ereignty.
Sadly, the Democrats are making us
consider a bill that will worsen, give a
green light to the border crisis,
incentivizing more people to cross our
borders illegally in hopes of getting a
piece of the amnesty pie.
No doubt, at this very minute, the
smuggling cartels are getting the word
out—just as we heard from migrants
walking across our border, they were
told it’s open—that there’s avail-
ability, to come across. They are tell-
ing them Congress is going to legalize
millions. Just get there. They will do it
for you.
I have repeatedly implored my com-
mittee chairman to give us a bill legal-
izing some of the illegal immigrant
population and include enforcement
measures to secure our border and en-
force our laws inside our country.
b 1515
Sadly, Democrats refuse. They had a
chance to show they are serious about
an immigration solution for DACA re-
cipients and perhaps even for the
Dreamers they have talked about pro-
tecting for years. Instead, today, we
are considering a political messaging
bill. The message is that America
won’t enforce its laws or protect its
people.
H.R. 6 provides a special path to citi-
zenship for millions of illegal immi-
grants as well as hundreds of thousands
of TPS and DED, or deferred enforced
departure, recipients. It places the in-
terests of those who have violated our
laws before those people who have
waited patiently for green cards to be-
come available. Because the bill pro-
vides that same path to some legal
nonimmigrants and even people living
outside America, the number of poten-
tial beneficiaries is completely un-
known.
H.R. 6 allows criminal aliens and
those who have committed immigra-
tion fraud to receive green cards. It re-
wards with green cards and eventual
citizenship the parents who knowingly
brought children to the U.S. illegally.
It incentives fraud through lax docu-
mentation requirements, allowing affi-
davits to show compliance with some
of those requirements and allowing
people to withdraw an application at
any time without prejudice.
H.R. 6 pretends to prevent alien gang
members from getting green cards, but
the prohibition is so deliberately nar-
row, it is virtually unworkable.
H.R. 6 actually provides U.S. tax-
payer funds to NGOs, in the form of
grant programs, to help illegal aliens
apply for green cards.
It has been said by my colleagues
across the aisle to not worry, that the
Department of Homeland Security Sec-
retary will have the nondelegable abil-
ity to review these. I am not sure what
my colleagues across the aisle believe
the Secretary does all day except re-
view these applications. It is the most
amazing thought and statement I have
ever heard.
If enacted, H.R. 6 would overwhelm
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Serv-
ices to the point where adjudicators
will be pulled off of processing legal
immigration benefits to process the
millions of applications resulting from
this bill. There will be several million
applications for amnesty because H.R.
6 has no consequence for filing a false
or frivolous application.
Hear me clearly: A person could file a
false or frivolous application, and there
is no consequence to it.
CBO has estimated that over the 2020
to 2029 period, the two bills combined
to make H.R. 6 would cost $26.3 billion
and $8.3 billion respectively, and that
is, frankly, I believe, an underestimate.
As evidenced by the two floor votes
last year, Republicans want to provide
legal status for DACA recipients. We
want to do it the right way, to mini-
mize fraud, to ensure criminals cannot
get legal status, and to bolster border
security. Without these commonsense
measures and compassionate measures,
we will find ourselves repeating this
conversation a few years from now.
Madam Speaker, H.R. 6 does none of
these things, so I urge my colleagues to
oppose this bill.
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. LOFGREN), the dis-
tinguished chairperson of the Immigra-
tion and Citizenship Subcommittee.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker,
today, we have the privilege of voting
for the American Dream and Promise
Act of 2019. This vote will bring Dream-
ers, young immigrants who came to
the country as children, as well as indi-
viduals who have lived here lawfully
for years under temporary protected
status or deferred enforced departure,
another step closer to being fully rec-
ognized as American.
Many of us, both inside and outside
this room, have been working to ad-
vance this legislation for almost two
decades. It is hard to believe that 18
years have passed since the Dream Act
was first introduced, and 9 years have
passed since the House last voted on it.
Yet, despite bipartisan support in
Congress as well as the support of al-
most 90 percent of the American peo-
ple, we have thus far been unable to get
this bill enacted into law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4274 June 4, 2019
I am proud to stand here with so
many colleagues who worked with de-
termination over the years to bring
this bill to the floor, as well as all the
young people and their allies who per-
sisted through setbacks and never gave
up on their call for lawful permanent
residence.
Madam Speaker, our work has paid
off. Today, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the American Dream and Promise
Act.
In September 2017, President Trump
announced the end of the Deferred Ac-
tion for Childhood Arrivals program,
otherwise known as DACA, which pro-
vided temporary relief from removal to
approximately 800,000 Dreamers. Over
the next few months, the administra-
tion announced plans to terminate the
TPS designation for six countries, as
well as DED for Liberia. These actions
have upended the lives of hundreds of
thousands of Dreamers and TPS and
DED holders.
They have come to the United States
in different ways, and they have had
different opportunities once they ar-
rived. But today, they are united not
only by the passage of time but also by
the uncertainty of the future. Congress
has the power to bring certainty to
their lives by passing this act.
The bill provides a fair and reason-
able opportunity for Dreamers to apply
for lawful permanent residence with
tough eligibility standards and discre-
tion to consider unique situations on a
case-by-case basis. The TPS and DED
holders must continue to meet the
strict eligibility requirements that al-
ready apply to them.
Based on comments made earlier dur-
ing the rules debate, comments that I
assume may be repeated during this de-
bate, I feel the need to remind every-
one just how tough this bill is.
To begin with, the bill applies crimi-
nal bars that apply to any other immi-
grant seeking admission to the United
States. It then adds to current law by
disqualifying anyone convicted of any
felony or more than two mis-
demeanors.
On top of that, it authorizes the Sec-
retary to deny individuals who pose a
threat to public safety based on a sin-
gle misdemeanor conviction, a juvenile
delinquency adjudication, or proof of
gang-related activities.
This is a very tough bill. Anyone who
poses a threat to public safety is sim-
ply ineligible under this bill.
This legislation should not be con-
troversial. The Dream Act has enjoyed
bipartisan support in the past, with
many of the same provisions. TPS and
DED holders are integral parts of our
communities and have been contrib-
uting to our economy for years, if not
decades.
On this point, I also want to stress
the important economic benefits that
Dreamers and TPS and DED holders
provide to our country.
Immigrants eligible for the American
Dream and Promise Act own 215,400
homes in the United States and pay an
estimated $2.5 billion in annual mort-
gage payments. If these individuals
were to lose their homes, be deported,
and default, it would certainly shock
housing markets around the country
and cause serious damage to cities,
States, and the economy as a whole.
Eligible immigrants and their house-
holds currently contribute around $17.4
billion per year in Federal taxes and
$9.7 billion per year in State and local
taxes.
Annually, these households generate
over $75 billion in spending power. That
money helps to fuel local economies,
creating new jobs and bringing new
economic prosperity to everyone living
and working with H.R. 6 beneficiaries
across the country.
Without this bill, these individuals
would lose their status and be kicked
out of the workforce, creating a major
hole in the American economy.
That may be why the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce has indicated it may
make this bill a key vote for its scor-
ing purposes and why hundreds of
major business leaders are urging us to
pass this bill in order to grow the econ-
omy and bolster our global competi-
tiveness.
We must set aside partisanship and
move this bill forward so that Dream-
ers and long-term TPS and DED recipi-
ents can finally have the peace of mind
they deserve and so that our country
can have the contributions that they
are ready to make.
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote
for the bill.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I
might consume.
Madam Speaker, just quickly, if
their criminality keeps them simply
ineligible, then why does the bill have
an entire section devoted to the Sec-
retary’s provisional authority of those
who conduct a public safety determina-
tion?
By the way, again, going to the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security, I am not
sure what they believe that person
does, but it is definitely not to review
these every day.
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to
the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ROG-
ERS), the ranking member of the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security.
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam
Speaker, I thank the ranking member
for yielding and for his leadership on
this issue.
Madam Speaker, there is a crisis at
our southwest border. In fact, we are
on track to break nearly every record
from recent history.
Just last week, CBP apprehended a
single group, one group, with 1,036 peo-
ple in it at the border. Madam Speaker,
we couldn’t fit that many people in
this Chamber, and we certainly can’t
fit them in a single Border Patrol sta-
tion.
This bill does nothing to address this
crisis. Instead, it tells an entire gen-
eration of illegal immigrants that
breaking our laws is rewarded.
This is not rocket science. We have
seen this before. In 2014, a wave of un-
accompanied children came to our bor-
ders, driven by smuggler propaganda
citing DACA and other amnesty poli-
cies.
The smugglers have doubled down.
They call children permisos, or per-
mits, and use them to get scores of
adults, unrelated to the children,
across the border.
Securing our border and enforcing
our laws is the only way to break this
cycle.
Ranking Member COLLINS introduced
legislation to close the asylum loop-
holes that are fueling this crisis. That
is the bill that should be on the floor
today.
We also desperately need to provide
supplemental funding to get us through
this crisis. Last month, I asked the
House to provide $4.5 billion that DHS
requested to address this humanitarian
and security crisis. Despite urgent
pleas for additional funds from front-
line personnel responsible for caring
for unaccompanied children, Demo-
crats refused to add the funds to the
supplemental.
Today, the majority again rejected
those funds during the previous ques-
tion vote. Democrats haven’t approved
a dime to address this crisis.
Because of the political dysfunction
in their own Caucus, they stubbornly
refuse to put forward real solutions. In-
stead, they put forward a bill today
that is sending a clear message: Demo-
crats would rather reward illegal im-
migrants than secure our border, en-
force our laws, and fix this crisis. It is
disgraceful.
Madam Speaker, I oppose this bill.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman
from California (Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD),
the chief sponsor of this bill.
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam
Speaker, let me begin by thanking my
cosponsors, NYDIA VELÁZQUEZ and
YVETTE CLARKE, Judiciary Chairman
NADLER, Chairman LOFGREN, the Judi-
ciary Committee, and especially Con-
gresswoman PRAMILA JAYAPAL for the
extraordinary work they did in bring-
ing this bill to the floor.
Today is truly a historic day for our
country. It will be the first time the
House of Representatives will pass a
Dream Act under regular order, send-
ing a strong message that Dreamers
and TPS and DED recipients truly be-
long in America and contribute greatly
to its success.
The American Dream and Promise
Act is landmark legislation that will
provide 2.1 million Dreamers with
hope, security, and the opportunity to
become American citizens.
We would not be here today without
the tireless work of Dreamers and TPS
and DED recipients who bravely and
publicly shared their stories with Mem-
bers of Congress and our Nation. Their
stories of endurance, resourcefulness,
and heartbreak, coupled with their love
of America, is what inspired me in 2001

June 4, 2019
to introduce the first Dream bill, a bi-
partisan bill known as the Student Ad-
justment Act, with former Congress-
men Howard Berman and Chris Can-
non.
One such story is of Josue, a student
studying aerospace engineering. He
dreams of contributing to the advance-
ment of space exploration and is one of
many Dreamers who will produce a new
generation of scientific research that
will help shape our country’s future.
Another Dreamer is Carolina, who
hopes to become a teacher, serving as a
role model, as her high school teacher
did for her.
And there is Julio, who is working
toward a psychology degree and whose
goal is to serve historically underrep-
resented and marginalized students as
a community college counselor.
This is just a sampling of Dreamers
whose stories exemplify American val-
ues, talents, and a desire to give back
to their community and the only coun-
try they know as home.
Although Dreamers live under the
veil of fear and uncertainty, they still
contribute over $17.3 billion in Federal
taxes and nearly $9.7 billion in State
and local taxes each year. Their house-
holds have $75 billion in buying power.
The reality is TPS and DED recipi-
ents and our Nation’s Dreamers make
our Nation stronger with the contribu-
tions they make to our economy and
our American society. We cannot af-
ford to lose or hinder their talents, re-
silience, and contributions to our Na-
tion.
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK), the
ranking member of the Subcommittee
on Immigration and Citizenship.
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. COL-
LINS), the ranking member, for yield-
ing.
Madam Speaker, this bill we are de-
bating today is fatally flawed. Repub-
licans are for a compassionate solution
to help DACA recipients, but that solu-
tion must be paired with commonsense
border security, interior enforcement,
and changes in policy to stem the tide
of illegal border crossings, human
smuggling, and frivolous claims of asy-
lum. Tragically, this bill does nothing
to address the crisis at our southern
border.
b 1530
Ninety-nine days ago, Chief of the
Border Patrol Carla Provost testified
before the Judiciary Committee that
‘‘a humanitarian and immigration cri-
sis’’ was occurring at the border. By
any measure, Chief Provost is correct.
Border Patrol stats show that total
apprehensions in the first 7 months of
the current fiscal year have already ex-
ceeded the total apprehensions from
last fiscal year.
What does this bill do to address that
reality and stem the tide of illegal bor-
der crossings? Nothing.
This year, the Border Patrol has also
seen a 266 percent increase in apprehen-
sions of aliens wanted by law enforce-
ment.
What does this bill do to address
that? Nothing. In fact, this bill con-
tains weak screening requirements
that will almost certainly put crimi-
nals on a path to citizenship. Repub-
licans tried to fix this at committee,
but our efforts were rejected by the
majority.
The Border Patrol also reports a
sharp increase in the apprehension of
gang members.
What does this bill to address that?
Nothing. The bill contains no addi-
tional enforcement resources, not even
to apprehend and remove known gang
members. This bill will certainly give
green cards to gang members.
Republicans tried to fix this in com-
mittee. Democrats rejected the amend-
ment, impugning the integrity of po-
lice departments across America in the
process by suggesting that America’s
cops indiscriminately add people to
gang databases.
Chief Provost also noted in her Feb-
ruary testimony that the nature of il-
legal border crossings has changed sig-
nificantly. A decade ago, the Border
Patrol used to apprehend, primarily,
single adult males. Today, there is an
unprecedented influx in family units
and unaccompanied minors.
Over the past 5 years, family unit ap-
prehensions are up 621 percent. Unac-
companied minor apprehensions are up
105 percent. The Border Patrol has evi-
dence showing that transnational
criminal organizations are exploiting
the law to traffic children, using a
child repeatedly to aid in the smug-
gling of adults into the U.S.
Why is there a crisis involving family
units and children? What changed? The
law.
In 2008, a Democratic Congress en-
acted the Unaccompanied Alien Child
Protection Act, a law that offers per-
verse incentives, leading to the very
problems we see today. In 2008, there
were 8,041 unaccompanied minors ap-
prehended at the border; last year,
50,036 apprehensions.
While the nature of the immigrants
detained has changed, Congress has not
kept pace with these changes. The Bor-
der Patrol is now in need of diapers,
formula, meals, and medical care ap-
propriate for children. Madam Speaker,
you would think that Democrats could
at least include more resources to care
for young children at the border, but
you would be wrong. This bill doesn’t
do that either.
Homeland Security is also hampered
by a 2014 court order limiting how long
Immigration and Customs Enforcement
can detain not only unaccompanied mi-
nors, but also children traveling with
parents and, in some cases, child traf-
fickers. This means entire family units
and criminals are released into the
U.S. after 20 days of detention.
DHS desperately needs Congress to
address this critical issue. Does this
bill fix this issue? No, it does not.
We also know that there is abuse of
our generous asylum laws. Aliens en-
countered at the border are being
coached to claim fear, guaranteeing
they will be released into the U.S.
Does this bill do anything to reduce
frivolous asylum claims? No.
Does it require asylum seekers to
apply at a legal port of entry? No.
Does it hold people accountable for
filing or assisting in filing fraudulent
claims? No.
Does it impose any kind of asylum
quota? No. This bill fails to advance
even basic asylum fixes.
Make no mistake about it, Madam
Speaker: The policies passed by this
House, even if they never become law,
will send a message.
If the House passes this bill, Demo-
crats will be sending a clear message to
DACA recipients, those young adults
brought here by their parents illegally,
that Democrats are willing to hold
these young adults hostage in the push
for open borders.
If the House passes this bill, we will
incentivize illegal immigration, just as
Congress did in 2008, and we will cer-
tainly get more of it. That is exactly
what this bill will do.
This is not compassionate. It is reck-
less. It is misguided.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman
from New York (Ms. VELÁZQUEZ), a
sponsor of the bill.
Ms. VELÁZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I
rise in support of this legislation.
Let me thank Speaker PELOSI, Chair-
man NADLER, Chairwoman LOFGREN,
LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD, and YVETTE
CLARKE for all their work on this legis-
lation.
Today, because of Donald Trump’s
anti-immigration policies, millions of
immigrants across the country live in
constant fear that they will face depor-
tation and potentially be separated
from their families. Among these im-
migrant communities are recipients of
TPS, or temporary protected status, or
DED, deferred enforced departure.
The portions of this bill I authored
say, if you have been here in the U.S.
for 3 years and have been here since
January 2017, then you can apply for
legal permanent residence and, from
there, pursue citizenship.
When we talk about our TPS and
DED populations, we are talking about
some of our most vulnerable neighbors.
These are people who fled natural dis-
asters or political violence. They came
here with the heartfelt belief that the
words inscribed at the base of the Stat-
ue of Liberty, ‘‘Give me . . . your
huddled masses yearning to breathe
free,’’ are not a hollow tourist attrac-
tion.
Those words are a sacred American
compact, etched into the character of
our Nation. And, today, as we launch
Immigrant Heritage Month, House
Democrats are going to prove to the
Dreamers, TPS recipients, and those in
the DED program the words on the
base of the statue are a promise we will
honor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4276 June 4, 2019
Madam Speaker, those in the TPS
community are our neighbors. The av-
erage TPS recipient has been in the
Nation for two decades, and almost a
third arrived in the U.S. younger than
age 18; they have built entire lives
here, many have American-born chil-
dren.
Deporting them will be cruel; it will
be inhumane; it will cause enormous
economic disruption; and it would not
be the America that we love and that
we know. We cannot let that happen.
For these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to do what they know is right.
Vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill. Let’s send a
strong message to the world that we
recognize that immigrants make
America America.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, it is my privilege to yield 5
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. RESCHENTHALER), an-
other member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee.
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam
Speaker, this week, as the humani-
tarian crisis at our southern border es-
calates, House Democrats want to pass
a bill that will actually make this situ-
ation even worse.
Daily border crossings at our south-
ern border have hit record highs in a
decade. Until just a few weeks ago, my
colleagues across the aisle were calling
this a manufactured crisis, but the
numbers don’t lie. On average, 4,500 in-
dividuals are apprehended each day
trying to illegally cross our southern
border.
Border Patrol is completely over-
whelmed; ICE facilities are full; and
HHS is at risk of running out of the re-
sources necessary to take care of unac-
companied children. Yet my colleagues
across the aisle want to just ignore
this humanitarian crisis and, instead,
pass a bill to actually encourage and
reward illegal entrants and incentivize
further illegal immigration.
H.R. 6 provides amnesty to millions
of people, placing the interests of those
who broke our laws above the interests
of those who followed our laws.
The bill also has no enforcement pro-
visions and includes loopholes that
make gang members and other crimi-
nals eligible for green cards. It even re-
quires that U.S. taxpayers fund grant
programs to help illegal immigrants
obtain green cards.
Most notably, it fails to provide any
additional resources for law enforce-
ment personnel at our border.
And let’s be realistic about this. We
all know this is dead on arrival at the
Senate, and here we are just wasting
our time.
Congress actually has the power and
the responsibility to address the hu-
manitarian crisis at our southern bor-
der. Unfortunately, my colleagues
across the aisle are too busy playing
party politics.
I want to thank Ranking Member
DOUG COLLINS for introducing legisla-
tion that will actually fix the root
causes of the problem at our southern
border, and I ask my colleagues across
the aisle to end this desperate political
showmanship and, instead, just work
with us to address this devastating se-
curity and humanitarian crisis at our
southern border.
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I
yield the balance of my time to the
gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOF-
GREN), and I ask unanimous consent
that she may control the time for the
majority.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. LEE
of California). Is there objection to the
request of the gentleman from New
York?
There was no objection.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman
from New York (Ms. CLARKE), the spon-
sor of the bill.
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam
Speaker, to Speaker PELOSI, Chair
NADLER, and Chair LOFGREN, my col-
leagues Representative ROYBAL-
ALLARD, Representative VELÁZQUEZ,
Representative JAYAPAL, and Rep-
resentative CHU, their leadership has
been tremendous in bringing forth H.R.
6, the Dream and Promise Act.
2.5 million, this is how many of our
neighbors, our friends, and our family
members will be able to officially call
themselves American citizens because
of the Dream and Promise Act as they
obtain legal permanent residency on
the pathway to citizenship.
I am proud to sponsor H.R. 6, the
Dream and Promise Act, which pro-
vides 2.5 million Dreamers, persons
with temporary protected status, and
deferred enforcement departure recipi-
ents with a pathway to citizenship—2.5
million people who already call Amer-
ica home and are mightily contributing
to our society.
As chair of the Congressional Black
Caucus Immigration Task Force and as
a second-generation American myself,
it is my passion and my duty to stand
up for immigrants.
From rural America to urban Amer-
ica, like in my district in Brooklyn,
New York, immigrants are part of all
of our communities. Immigrants own,
operate, and shop at our corner shops
and bodegas; immigrants cheer on their
kids at neighborhood soccer games; and
immigrants worship with us at our
places of worship. Simply put, immi-
grants are woven into the fabric of our
society.
The Dream and Promise Act is com-
monsense immigration policy, com-
monsense immigration policy that rec-
ognizes today’s immigrant dilemmas—
Dreamers and TPS and DED recipients
who are contributing to our commu-
nities and are part of our blended sta-
tus families—and provides them with a
long, overdue pathway to citizenship.
In New York City alone, where my
district is located, more than 109,000
people are eligible for the Dream and
Promise Act. That number balloons to
more than 180,000 people when you take
into account the entire State of New
York. These immigrants are not only a
part of our social fabric, but they di-
rectly boost our economy.
I look around in this Chamber and I
would be hard-pressed to find anyone
who hasn’t been positively impacted,
directly or indirectly, by the multitude
of ways that these immigrants have
added value to our communities.
For example, in my home State of
New York, immigrants eligible for the
Dream and Promise Act own 9,500
homes and pay $228,300,000 each year in
mortgage payments. These same immi-
grants contribute more than $1.6 bil-
lion each year in Federal taxes and
more.
Having said that, Madam Speaker, I
am proud to stand shoulder to shoulder
with my colleagues.
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE

Chair will remind all persons in the
gallery that they are here as guests of

ceedings is in violation of the rules of

Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCCLIN-
TOCK).
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker,
as we dither and posture and virtue sig-
nal here today, our southern border is
collapsing.
The border patrol warns that before
this year is out, they will have appre-
hended over 1 million illegal aliens
making a mockery of our sovereignty
and our asylum laws. Unless Congress
acts, these illegals will have to be re-
leased into our country; that is the
population of the cities of Atlanta and
Sacramento combined.
Now, instead of taking simple meas-
ures necessary to secure our borders
and reserve our asylum laws for the
truly persecuted, the House meets
today to grant blanket amnesty to
roughly 2.5 million illegal aliens, en-
couraging millions more that they,
too, can violate our borders with impu-
nity.
Now, the Democrats have long-advo-
cated free services for illegals: free
healthcare, legal counsel, education,
food, housing—all paid by American
taxpayers.
Now, they deny they support illegal
immigration; yet, they heap rewards
on those who illegally immigrate.
Many have gone so far as to advocate
abolishing the agencies that defend our
borders.
Democrats long ago ceased to call il-
legal immigration for what it is—ille-
gal. They have supported allowing ille-
gal aliens to vote in our elections and
opposed visa tracking of foreign na-
tionals entering our country.
They have even enacted sanctuary
laws that require dangerous criminal
illegal aliens to be released back into
our communities rather than to be de-
ported, as Federal law requires.
Now, the real tragedy today is that
there are hundreds of thousands of

children who were brought here ille-
gally and, in effect, stranded here with-
out a country.
They have no legal status here, yet
little familiarity with their birth coun-
try. And there is broad bipartisan sup-
port to remedy this situation today,
but we cannot do that until we first
fully secure our border and fully en-
force our immigration laws. Otherwise,
we simply encourage more children be
brought here illegally, producing yet
another generation who will come to us
in a few years with the same demands
that we hear today.
We could address both issues right
now, right here and now. If full funding
of the border wall and reform of our
asylum laws were to be combined with
legalizing the status of children who
were brought here and raised here,
through no fault of their own, this bill
could become law in a matter of days.
Within days, we could bring these
young people out of legal limbo and re-
store the integrity of our borders—
within days.
But by forcing the completely one-
sided partisan approach, the Democrats
end up with precisely nothing.
This is not legislating. This is farce.
And history is screaming this warn-
ing at us that nations that either can-
not or will not secure their borders
simply aren’t around very long.
Madam Speaker, let that not be the
epitaph of the American republic.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL), the
vice chair of the Immigration Sub-
committee, and a fierce proponent of
this bill.
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I am
so very proud to rise in strong support
of H.R. 6, the American Dream and
Promise Act.
At the heart and the core of this bill
are 2.5 million people who are Amer-
ican in every single way but paper.
Dreamers, and those with temporary
protective status and DED, are integral
parts of our communities and families;
a community of strivers who have
given and will continue to contribute
to America in the finest of our tradi-
tions as a Nation.
Over 400,000 U.S. citizens live in a
household with TPS holders. They own
homes in our communities and fill crit-
ical workforce gaps central to our eco-
nomic and community development,
including in construction, food service
and landscaping.
And Dreamers, too, have long-called
the United States their home. One of
those Dreamers is Esther, who interned
in my office last year.
Esther came to the United States on
a visa when she was 3 years old from
South Korea. Her parents sought to ob-
tain more permanent legal status.
They gave an immigration lawyer most
of their money, and he ran away with
all of it. Esther’s parents’ visas ex-
pired.
They pushed their kids around in a
shopping cart because a stroller was
too expensive. But they started over
and they built their lives here, raising
a smart, passionate daughter who went
to Harvard.
The DACA status that Esther ob-
tained in 2013 helped her to pursue her
own American dream. And this bill
would give her, and so many millions
more, true freedom.
At the core of this bill, Madam
Speaker, is the dignity and respect
that we accord to human beings, the
way in which we see people and exer-
cise our own compassion.
We have a rare opportunity today to
provide permanent protections for
Dreamers and TPS and DED holders,
not just for them, but also for the ap-
proximately 1 million U.S.-born chil-
dren whose parents would get perma-
nent protection.
This is a first step, not a last. We
must stop criminalizing immigrants at
every turn, even as we willingly accept
their labor and contributions.
We cannot allow xenophobia and rac-
ism to permeate our country from its
top ranks. We must continue the work
to pass germane and just, comprehen-
sive immigration reform that provides
a roadmap to citizenship for 11 million
undocumented immigrants, strength-
ens family-based immigration, and pro-
tects workers’ rights on the job.
But today, Madam Speaker, we have
a chance to right real wrongs for these
young people and TPS and DED hold-
ers. And I thank Chairman NADLER, the
incredible Immigration and Citizenship
Subcommittee Chairwoman, ZOE LOF-
GREN, and my colleagues, Representa-
tives ROYBAL-ALLARD, VELÁZQUEZ, and
CLARKE for their hard work to bring
this forward.
I also thank our staffers—including
mine—Jennifer Chan in my office, but
most of all, Madam Speaker, I thank
the Dreamers, TPS and DED holders,
families, friends, and advocates, many
of whom are here in this Chamber.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
CLARKE of New York). The time of the
gentlewoman has expired.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield an additional 15 seconds to the
gentlewoman.
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I
thank the Dreamers, TPS and DED
holders, the families, friends and advo-
cates, many of whom are right here in
this Chamber with us.
Thank you for your courage in speak-
ing out.
Thank you for demanding a different
and more just future for our country.
Thank you for knowing that we al-
ways make the road by walking and for
never giving up.
Madam Speaker, we have a chance to
affirm the hope and promise of Amer-
ica. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this bill.
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair will remind all persons in the
gallery that they are here as guests of
the House and that any manifestation
of approval or disapproval of pro-
ceedings is in violation of the rules of
the House.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS), an-
other committee member.
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentleman from Georgia.
I can’t help but to be struck here as
I reflect on the markup that we had, as
we have listened to the Rules debate
earlier, plus this debate.
I can’t help but be struck by the very
notion of this is kind of what happens
whenever you start moving the goal-
posts on what a law should be.
So under the Obama Administration,
deferred action was provided for chil-
dren who were brought into the coun-
try by a certain date and time, through
no fault of their own, and that number
was about 800,000 people applied for
that.
Now, the estimate is somewhere in
the neighborhood of an additional 1
million who might have qualified who
didn’t file the requisite application.
And now, this particular bill, as several
of my colleagues across the aisle have
said, will apply to anywhere from 2.2 to
2.7 million people.
You can see the number starts creep-
ing as we go forward here, as we change
laws, and we acknowledge certain ideas
about what the law should be.
So this actually is not about DACA.
We left DACA a long time ago. And,
quite frankly, there is no age limit
here. So even an alien who entered the
U.S. illegally 30 or 40 years ago, could
be granted a green card under this bill.
So we see that it has other problems as
well.
So then we start talking about gang
members, and we say, Oh, yeah, no, no,
this is really tough on gang members.
But in fact, the denial provision is
written so narrowly that it will almost
never exclude gang members. In fact, it
actually prohibits the use of gang data-
bases to establish gang participation in
order to deny green cards to gang
members.
You got that? You can’t use gang
databases.
And moreover, only the Secretary of
Homeland Security—and he or she can-
not delegate that authority to other of-
ficials—can provisionally deny an ap-
plicant.
And what makes this particularly in-
triguing is if there is a denial, we are
charging a fee, so that free attorneys
can be hired on to represent these gang
members who are provisionally denied.
So they can challenge the Secretary’s
determination, and that is done by a de
novo review.
So this is a real problem. It is too
narrowly crafted in this area. And
there are some other areas—and some
of my colleagues have talked about it—
but ultimately, we get to the heart of
this, and it is just this: There is a bor-
der crisis. This bill does nothing to
stop that border crisis. It will do noth-
ing to slow the number of people who
are entering this country illegally. In
fact, it will do just the opposite, be-
cause it provides an incentive.

People respond to incentives. I re-
spond to incentives. You respond to in-
centives.
We also respond to deterrence. We re-
move deterrence here. Instead, we but-
tressed incentives.
And so we will have a year where we
are going to apprehend about 1.2 mil-
lion people, at the low end. We know
that a year ago we were getting about
half; we were apprehending about half
the people.
And we know about 4 months ago, we
were getting only about a third of the
people. Now, we have no idea what the
getaways are.
You can talk to border patrol agents,
ICE agents—whoever you want to talk
to down at the border—and they will
tell you, ‘‘we have no idea the numbers
coming in because we are over-
whelmed.’’
When I was down in Yuma, the Yuma
facility is designed for 250 people. A
month and a half ago, it held 750 people
in inhumane conditions.
No question. Inhumane conditions.
Today, that number is over 1,000,
going through that same facility. That
is inhumane.
And so we are just releasing them.
We are releasing them, and we are say-
ing, Come back in a couple of years.
And you know what? We have got a
million people who have absconded
from their court dates. We have got an-
other million people with active re-
moval orders.
You think this is going to serve this
problem long-term? I am sad to tell
you, it won’t.
You are going to see more people
come because you have got the incen-
tives in place. And they are not just
coming from Mexico or the Northern
Triangle. They are coming from Ven-
ezuela; they are coming from Cuba;
they are coming from Africa; they are
coming from China.
They are coming from all over the
world today. And they are coming be-
cause they know that we have no place
for them. They will be released into the
interior, and we will continue to be
overwhelmed.
This bill will contribute to that prob-
lem.
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), a long-
serving member of the Committee on
the Judiciary.
b 1600
Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gen-
tlewoman from California, and I ac-
knowledge all the dynamic leadership
that has generated where we are today,
including all the sponsors whose names
I recognized earlier and, of course, the
magnificent persons who have met
with us over and over again, who met
with me. I remember the roundtable
that I had of Dreamers in Houston, and
their stories are powerful.
Let me say to my bipartisan friends,
friends from Texas, let us work to-
gether. One gentleman was up speaking
about the need for Border Patrol and
CBP. As someone who has introduced
comprehensive immigration reform, as
a former ranking member of the Judi-
ciary Committee’s Immigration Sub-
committee, I can tell you that we are
ready to work. That work, of course, is
done in the Homeland Security Com-
mittee.
Let’s fund and write the legislation
for our leader there, Chairman THOMP-
SON, to be able to provide the resources
that CBP is asking for, which the ad-
ministration is not giving to them, and
that is more staff, more health facili-
ties, better physical plants, and more
judges to help with the asylum cases.
I am ready to work. Today, we have
a job to do. We have a job to do for the
386,300 immigrants who are eligible in
my State, the same State that my col-
leagues represent.
These individuals live with 845,300
family members. Interestingly, they
provide some $340 million in mortgage
payments, $2 trillion in Federal taxes,
and $1 trillion in State and local taxes.
We are looking at people who are work-
ing. Let me also indicate that the eco-
nomic opportunities for these individ-
uals are enormous.
One thing I want to indicate is that
it is not DACA that is driving people.
The surge is being driven by the vio-
lence in El Salvador and other places,
not by DACA. It is also being driven by
wrong-headed State legislators or
State officials like the Texas attorney
general, Ken Paxton, who threatened a
lawsuit, which he did, if they didn’t
stop DACA.
When they stopped DACA, they put
millions of young people in jeopardy.
They even ignored the tragedy of
Alonso, who lost his life coming down
to Houston, in Harris County, to save
people who were suffering from Hurri-
cane Harvey.
Which of us on this floor went down
to try and save anyone? Who sacrificed
and lost their lives? What about the
millions of young people who are doc-
tors and lawyers and teachers in our
districts or the paramedic whom I met
in my roundtable discussion who is
saving lives every day?
These false premises are killing us
because we are the land of laws and the
land of immigrants. I am reminded of
the Statue of Liberty.
Let’s pass this bill. Let’s grant TPS.
Let’s be Americans who love this coun-
try and value the Constitution, the
Declaration of Independence, and the
equality of all people.
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the
Committees on the Judiciary and on Home-
land Security, and a representative of a state
on the southern border, I rise in strong support
of the rule governing debate of H.R. 6, the
‘‘American Dream and Promise Act of 2019,’’
and the underlying legislation.
Today’s debate and consideration of this bill
is a historic step for this vital piece of legisla-
tion.
The American Dream and Promise Act of
2019 establishes a roadmap to U.S. citizen-
ship for (1) immigrant youth and current or po-
tential holders of (a) temporary protected sta-
tus (TPS) or (b) deferred enforced departure
(DED).
Today’s vote is not the end of the work we
have to do. It is the beginning.
We are here on behalf of all of the Dream-
ers all across the country and in each of our
Congressional districts.
For example, in the Eighteenth Congres-
sional District, there are 13,600 Dreamers eli-
gible for DACA protections.
I have met with these individuals and heard
the fear in their voices as they speak about
the jeopardy they feel as a result of their un-
protected status.
Just a few weeks ago, I met with recipients
of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals—
our nation’s dreamers. This was one of many
events I have had that engages residents of
Houston.
It is through these events that I meet advo-
cates on this vital issue.
I think of my good friend Cesar Espinoza,
whom I know through a group called FIEL.
Cesar has a younger brother and a younger
sister. His brother was able to get citizenship
because as a minor, his citizenship was auto-
matic when his mother became a citizen.
But Cesar himself is a recipient of DACA
and so is his sister.
With the President’s rescission of this pro-
gram, he has placed in peril families like
Cesar’s family.
The Dream and Promise Act would add cer-
tainty to the lives of these individuals so that
they can pursue their lives without having to
account for a circumstances placed on them
by their parents.
Today’s vote represents the first time that
the Dream Act is being considered.
It is the product of years of determination,
grit, and perseverance.
The bill is supported by the business com-
munity as well as human rights groups.
The DREAM Act is supported by tradition-
ally conservative groups like the U.S. Cham-
ber of Commerce and the CATO institute.
The bill is one of the most significant pieces
of pro-immigrant legislation to be voted on—
and passed—in years, and many advocates
across the country spent the day watching the
progress of the bill through committee.
When we considered this bill in the Judiciary
Committee, it was a markup that lasted over
8 hours.
During that time, we did not consider any
legislation that would strengthen the bill con-
sistent with its charge to bring peace of mind
and security to our nation’s Dreamers.
Instead, we sat there as members of the
Committee from the other side of the aisle,
tried to deny the country and the nation’s hun-
dreds of thousands of Dreamers the peace of
mind that they are owed.
Under the Dream Act, undocumented immi-
grants who were under the age of 18 upon ar-
rival in the United States and have lived in the
country for at least four years, would be eligi-
ble for a conditional permanent resident (CPR)
status if they are enrolled in secondary school
or have a high school diploma, equivalent, or
industry recognized credential, and pass a
background check.
Under this bill, 1.8 million immigrants will be
immediately eligible for this CPR status.
Ensuring a path to earned citizenship is a
non-negotiable principle for me and the sine
qua non of meaningful immigration reform leg-
islation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4279
June 4, 2019
Indeed, providing a path to earned access
to citizenship has been a central feature of
every comprehensive immigration reform bill I
have co-sponsored or sponsored in the Con-
gress since 2007 when I became Ranking
Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee
on Immigration and introduced the ‘‘Save
America Comprehensive Immigration Reform
Act, (H.R. 1525),’’ which I have reintroduced in
each succeeding Congress.
Like H.R. 6, Section 501 of my legislation
provides a path to earned legalization status
to those undocumented immigrants who have
resided in the United States for 5 years and
meet other eligibility requirements.
Madam Speaker, as we stand today on the
precipice of passing the American Dream and
Promise Act of 2019, I am thinking of the hun-
dreds of thousands of young immigrants
whose lives will be changed for the better by
keeping our promise to them, so they can re-
alize their dreams and making America better,
stronger, and more prosperous.
And at this moment, I am thinking of Alonso
Guillen, an heroic DREAMER who lived in my
congressional district, and who came to the
United States from Mexico as a child and died
when his boat capsized while he was rescuing
survivors of the flooding caused by Hurricane
Harvey in the Houston area.
That is the type of courage, honor, and
commitment to service we are talking when
we speak of DREAMERS.
Madam Speaker, Title I of H.R. 6, the
Dream Act of 2019, contains provisions re-
garding relief for immigrant youth.
Title II of the bill, American Promise Act of
2019, contains provisions related to persons
eligible Temporary Protected Stats (TPS) or
Deferred Enforcement Departure; the third and
final title contains general provisions that apply
to both Titles I & II).
Madam Speaker, I support H.R. 6 because
it keeps America’s word to the more than
800,000 young people we asked to come out
of the shadows and walk proudly and un-
ashamedly as legitimate members of the
American community.
The legislation does this by providing condi-
tional permanent resident (CPR) status and a
roadmap to lawful permanent resident (LPR)
status and, eventually, earned U.S. citizenship
for immigrant youth who entered the U.S. be-
fore age 18, have four or more years of resi-
dency, and graduated from high school (or the
equivalent).
H.R. 6 also provides an opportunity to apply
for LPR status for people who currently have
or who may be eligible for TPS or DED and
who have three or more years of residency.
Madam Speaker, individuals who are eligi-
ble for protection under the bill have lived in
the United States for much of their lives; the
average Dreamer came to the United States
at the age of 8, while the average TPS- or
DED-eligible person arrived in 1997.
Without permanent protections such as
those in H.R. 6, these immigrants’ and their
families’ futures in the United States—as well
as the fiscal and economic contributions they
make—are at risk.
Passing this legislation is the right thing to
do and now is the time to do it; in fact, it is
long overdue.
I am mindful also Madam Speaker that in
addition to helping restore America’s reputa-
tion as the most welcoming nation on earth,
the legislation the House will pass also posi-
tions America to better compete and win in the
global economy of the 21st century.
According to expert studies, including one
by the Center for American Progress, ending
deferred action for childhood arrivals would re-
sult in a loss of $460.3 billion from the national
GDP over the ensuing decade and would re-
move an estimated 685,000 workers from the
nation’s economy and workforce at a time
when more, not fewer, workers are des-
perately needed.
And 10 states, including my home state of
Texas, would stand to lose more than $8 bil-
lion annually in state GDP.
Madam Speaker, immigrants eligible for pro-
tection under H.R. 6 are part of Texas’s social
fabric.
Texas is home to 386,300 immigrants who
are eligible for protection under the Dream
and Promise Act, 112,000 of whom reside in
Harris County.
These individuals live with 845,300 family
members and among those family members,
178,700 are U.S.-born citizen children.
Dreamers in Texas who are eligible for pro-
tection under the bill arrived in the United
States at the average age of 8.
TPS- and DED-eligible immigrants in Texas
who would be eligible for protection under
H.R. 6 have on average lived in the United
States since 1996.
Immigrants eligible for the Dream and Prom-
ise Act own 43,500 homes in Texas and pay
$340,500,000 in annual mortgage payments.
Eligible immigrants in Texas and their
households contribute $2,234,800,000 in fed-
eral taxes and $1,265,200,000 in state and
local taxes each year.
Annually, these households generate
$10,519,000,000 in spending power in Texas
and help power the national economy.
Madam Speaker, during general debate on
H.R. 6, I will have more to discuss about the
salient features of this long overdue legislation
that fulfills the American promise that all of its
residents who share our values and respect
for the Constitution and laws have an oppor-
tunity to realize their dreams.
But in the limited time I have now, let me
highlight some of the more important provi-
sions of the American Dream and Promise
Act.
H.R. 6 helps young persons in the following
ways:
1. Extends the length of conditional perma-
nent resident (CPR) status from eight to ten
years to give applicants more time to fulfill re-
quirements;
2. Stays the removal of minors who are not
yet eligible for relief but may become eligible
in the future and who temporarily unenroll
from school;
3. Permits people with CPR to obtain legal
permanent resident (LPR) status without satis-
fying the employment, military, or educational
tracks if their deportation would cause ‘‘hard-
ship’’ to themselves or immediate family mem-
bers (instead of ‘‘extreme hardship’’);
4. Includes apprenticeship programs as a
qualifying education to obtain CPR status;
5. Eliminates the costly medical examination
for applicants;
6. Establishes a fee ceiling of $495 for im-
migrant youth applying for CPR status;
7. Clarifies that people with CPR can ac-
cess professional, commercial, and business
licenses;
8. Permits people with CPR who obtain a
certificate or credential from an area career
and technical education school to obtain LPR
status; and
9. Updates the criminal background bars
and inadmissibility requirements.
Additionally, H.R. 6 provides LPR status to
CPR holders who (1) serve in the uniformed
services for two years; (2) complete two years
at or obtain a degree from an institution of
higher education; or (3) work 75 percent of the
time in CPR.
Another important feature of this legislation
is that makes it easier for states to provide in-
state tuition to immigrant students and estab-
lishes that CPR-holders are eligible for federal
loans, work study, services, and grants.
I mentioned earlier that we sat through a
marathon session of the Judiciary Committee.
That’s because some on the committee
could not bring themselves to see our nation’s
Dreamers as anything other than criminals.
They see the act that brought them here
with their parents as nothing more than a
crime.
Indeed if you did not know better, and you
listened to the parade of horribles put forth by
the other side.
You would think that if we merely deported
all of our nation’s Dreamers—hardworking
young people seeking to make their lives in
America—all crime in the nation would stop.
In Committee we heard all sorts of dramatic
stories. We heard of gang members who
would feel liberated to take advantage of this
program.
We heard this was amnesty. We heard that
this bill perpetrates a crisis. We heard this
would enable a humanitarian crisis. We have
heard that this legislation was a disgrace.
We heard horror stories of criminals who
would take the Dream Act to serve their own
ends.
This is wrong.
They cannot see that these children are
American in every way except for that piece of
paper.
For persons with TPS or DED status, the
American Dream and Promise Act provides
much needed relief.
First, H.R. 6 provides LPR status for people
with TPS or DED (and those who were eligible
but did not apply) who apply within three years
from the date of enactment if they (1) had at
least three years of continuous residence (as
well as residence since the date required the
last time that the person’s nation of origin was
designated) and (2) were eligible for or had (a)
TPS on September 25, 2016, or (b) DED on
September 28, 2016.
This protection covers nationals of 13 coun-
tries: El Salvador, Guinea, Haiti, Honduras, Li-
beria, Nepal, Nicaragua, Sierra Leone, Soma-
lia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.
I believe similar protections should be ex-
tended to Guatemalan nationals in our coun-
try, which is why I will soon reintroduce the
‘‘Continue American Safety Act,’’ which ex-
tends TPS status to Guatemala and I look for-
ward to working with my colleagues to achieve
this outcome.
Second, H.R. 6 classifies people with TPS
or DED as inspected and admitted for the pur-
poses of Immigration & Nationality Act (INA)
section 245(a), making it easier to obtain LPR
status through existing channels (e.g., a fam-
ily-based petition).
Third, H.R. 6 stays the removal or deporta-
tion of an individual while an application is
pending.

H4280 June 4, 2019
Fourth, the American Dream and Promise
Act establishes a fee ceiling of $1,140 for peo-
ple with TPS or DED applying for LPR status.
Fifth, the legislation provides greater trans-
parency by requiring the Secretary of the
Homeland Security (DHS) to provide an expla-
nation for and report within three days of pub-
lishing notice to terminate TPS designation for
certain nationals.
I have one the gentleman from North Caro-
lina remarked on the bill—he indicated that
legislation with great names does not make it
great legislation and we should not pass a bill
that does not have a chance of passage in the
Senate.
We cannot let the fact that this House of
Representatives has passed countless pieces
of legislation and that they have gone to the
graveyard in the Senate.
Acting for the people, in order to deliver a
better deal, House Democrats have passed
legislation to strengthen our democracy, with
H.R. 1, the For the People Act.
We have passed legislation to end anti-
LGBT discrimination with H.R. 5, the Equality
Act.
We have passed a nonbinding resolution to
pass the full Mueller Report.
We have passed legislation to reauthorize
the Violence Against Women Act, landmark
legislation which—through policy reforms,
interstate cooperation and grant allocation—
has been pivotal in providing a national re-
sponse to protecting half of the population.
And, as this week dawned, it did so with
flags at half-staff, a recognition of the 12 peo-
ple who were shot and killed in just the latest
incident of mass shootings.
That is why the House of Representatives
passed H.R. 8, the first piece of gun safety
legislation, the first piece of gun safety legisla-
tion to pass the House in a quarter-century.
Put simply we cannot accept Senate inac-
tion as a reason not to do anything.
The Senate must act for the American Peo-
ple, in not just passing the bills I just men-
tioned above, but also passing the Dream and
Promise Act. Indeed, in a recent public opinion
poll, protections for Dreamers received 83%
support from Americans.
Madam Speaker, H.R. 6 is exceptional leg-
islation and a welcome development but is not
a substitute for undertaking the comprehen-
sive reform and modernization of the nation’s
immigration laws supported by the American
people.
Only Congress can do that and passage of
H.R. 6 shows that this House has the will and
is up to the challenge.
Comprehensive immigration reform is des-
perately needed to ensure that Lady Liberty’s
lamp remains the symbol of a land that wel-
comes immigrants to a community of immi-
grants and does so in a manner that secures
our borders and protects our homeland.
Madam Speaker, let us build on the historic
legislation that is the American Dream and
Promise Act and seize the opportunity to pass
legislation that secures our borders, preserves
America’s character as the most open and
welcoming country in the history of the world,
and will yield hundreds of billions of dollars in
economic growth.
I urge all Members to support the rule gov-
erning debate of H.R. 6 and the underlying
bill.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam
Speaker, I would remind the gentle-
woman from Texas that, as Americans,
we also have rule of law. We stand for
that and have wanted to fix the DACA
situation, not just give a green light to
continue a problem on the border that
we are continually seeing.
There are problems with this bill. It
is not a perfect bill and doesn’t fit, in
many ways. We are pointing that out.
The pride that we take in that is not
that we are seeing something broken.
It is the pride that we need to fix some-
thing in this. We want to see these re-
cipients be here and be able to partici-
pate in a legal fashion.
The legal immigration system is
being overwhelmed by the illegal popu-
lation coming across, which we are not
fixing, and don’t say that we are be-
cause we are not. Nothing has come to
this floor, and it happens every day.
Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.
CLINE), another member of the Judici-
ary Committee.
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman from Texas for her
remarks. She alluded to a number of
reforms to our legal immigration proc-
ess, and yes, I stand ready to work with
the gentlewoman on those issues, but
none of the legal reforms that are nec-
essary to balance this legislation are in
this bill.
In fact, this bill is called the Amer-
ican Dream and Promise Act, but if we
are looking for reforms that will secure
our border, we are dreaming. The only
promise being kept is the promise to
put people who are here illegally ahead
of legal immigrants in line for citizen-
ship. It is a grave disappointment and
a violation of this document, the Con-
stitution of the United States.
The American people might think,
when tuning in, hey, great, we are fi-
nally addressing immigration, so
maybe we will find a way to secure our
borders. But this bill has no language
to secure our borders, no language to
build the wall, no language to help
children and families in terrible condi-
tions at the border, no language to re-
form our asylum programs or our visa
programs to make them more efficient,
and no language to stop the thousands
of caravans of illegals crossing over the
border, over 5,000 each and every day.
Instead, it does the exact opposite. It
incentivizes illegal immigration. It
incentivizes the dangerous journey
that these families are taking.
We have heard a lot from the other
side about individuals here illegally
who are achieving, but we can cite
every individual who is currently fac-
ing enormous danger, children facing
enormous danger on this journey to the
border, one in three women who are
facing sexual assault on this journey to
the border, families right now who are
deciding whether or not to put their
children at risk of death by marching
up to the United States because they
are hoping that there is an incentivized
program like this in place when they
get here.
We need to take action to control our
border. We will never stop the flow of
illegal immigration coming into this
country until we get serious about se-
curing the border and until we follow
through on the enforcement mecha-
nisms that Congress has and continues
to put in place. Until we do that,
human trafficking, drug smuggling,
and cartels will continue to thrive.
This bill is unfair to immigrants who
have obeyed the law to enter our coun-
try legally. America welcomes all who
are coming to our Nation who respect
the rule of law and want to contribute
to our society. Unfortunately, they
will be left to wait while USCIS at-
tempts to process the millions of appli-
cations that today’s legislation would
authorize.
It creates a system that is ripe for
fraud and abuse. It includes a laundry
list of unverifiable documents that can
be used to obtain green cards.
Mr. Speaker, there is nothing in this
legislation that fixes what is wrong
with our immigration laws. This is the
wrong way to go. I hope that my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle
will quit playing politics with people’s
lives and work with this side of the
aisle to fix our broken immigration
system and replace it with a system
based on merit.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. JOHNSON), a member of the Ju-
diciary Committee.
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I thank
the bold and courageous women of the
House of Representatives with the
Democratic Party for their strong
hearts, minds, and leadership in press-
ing the action for passage of H.R. 6,
which will help millions of people—
men, women, and children—who by all
accounts are already Americans.
They pay taxes, serve in our mili-
tary, and attend our schools. They
should not be dehumanized by calling
them illegals or illegal aliens. Don’t
stereotype them as drug dealers, rap-
ists, and murderers. They are real peo-
ple contributing to America’s great-
ness.
My district alone has over 7,000 con-
stituents who would benefit from these
Dream, TPS, and DED reforms. These
are Americans whom the system is fail-
ing, people who grew up on the
foundational American principle that
if you work hard, you can improve the
future for your children. And they do
work hard.
But Republican inaction and hos-
tility have put their American Dream
at risk, and they face deportation to a
country they have never known.
My Republican colleagues should rec-
ognize that this is a good bill. It is a
necessary bill. It is a bill that will im-
prove the country we all love. Have a
heart. Pass H.R. 6.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman
from Iowa (Mr. KING).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4281
June 4, 2019
this discussion was the subject of am-
nesty. This bill is clearly amnesty, and
it is amnesty for a large chunk of peo-
ple, whether they do the math at 2 mil-
lion, 2.2 million, 2.7 million, or what-
ever that number may be north of that.
Whenever we have had amnesty in this
country, it has always been a lot more
than was calculated.
I recall those days back in 1986 when
Ronald Reagan let me down. He only
did it twice in 8 years, but this was one
time.
I watched the debate in the House
and the Senate on whether to grant
amnesty to roughly a million people.
All along, I believed that the wisdom of
the House and Senate would prevail,
and they would understand that am-
nesty destroys the rule of law.
I listened carefully, and the debate
went the other way. The bill was sent
to the President’s desk.
But I was confident that Ronald
Reagan would see the principle and
protect the rule of law and veto the
amnesty act. Well, we all know he
signed it that day in 1986. He regretted
it after that, as did many of his Cabi-
net members, but that was a big mis-
take.
This is an amnesty bill, and it goes a
long way toward the destruction of im-
migration law. When you send out an
advertisement that if you can get into
America, you get to stay in America,
people are going to keep coming here.
It doesn’t stop until they have to go
back home again to tell those folks
whom they had recently left that they
didn’t get to stay in America, to dis-
courage the rest of them.
Here is an example: In a briefing
from Francis Cissna, the recently re-
tired Director of USCIS, he gave us
these numbers. He said of 100 percent of
those who apply for asylum, there will
be 60 percent who show up for their
asylum hearings. That surprised me. I
thought the number would be maybe 95
percent that wouldn’t show up. Sixty
percent show up; 40 percent do not.
Of the 60 percent, 10 percent get asy-
lum. That amounts to 6 percent of the
whole. Forty percent don’t show up.
Fifty-four percent then get assigned a
deportation hearing, and they don’t
show up at all.
When you add 40 percent, 54 percent,
and 6 percent, that is 100 percent of
them who get to stay in America.
I recall a night when I was in Serbia
in the middle of that huge, epic migra-
tion. I asked the chief of police, who
was directing traffic, loading trains to
go off to Germany out of Serbia, when
and why this ever stops. The first thing
he said was the international answer
of, ‘‘That is beyond my pay grade.’’ But
then, as I pressed him, he said it only
stops when the people receiving them
stop receiving them.
That is the principle here. We have to
decide what we are going to do here.
Whom are we going to say no to? I
haven’t heard anybody define, espe-
cially on the other side, whom we
might say no to. This is just the people
that we want to say yes to, or at least
as far as the left wants to say yes to.
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
AGUILAR). The time of the gentleman
has expired.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield an additional 30 seconds to
the gentleman from Iowa.
Mr. KING of Iowa. There is a report
that, before the last census, with an
average 710,000 in a Member’s congres-
sional district, at least six districts in
California were comprised, figu-
ratively, of illegal aliens. That means
that illegal aliens in California had
more representation in the United
States Congress than any one of 23
States that have less representation.
That is something to keep in mind as
this debate moves on.
Mr. Speaker, I don’t think this bill
goes anywhere, but if it does, it could
be the destruction of the rule of law
and the fracture of the United States of
America.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Rhode
Island (Mr. CICILLINE), a member of our
Judiciary Committee.
Mr. CICILLINE. I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding.
I rise in strong support of H.R. 6, the
American Dream and Promise Act.
This legislation will protect 2.5 mil-
lion people as American as everyone in
this Chamber but for a piece of paper,
young people who came here as chil-
dren, brought by their families to pur-
sue the American Dream. That is why
we call them Dreamers.
They did what we would expect of
any other good American. They worked
hard. They served in our communities.
They served in our military. They
studied at our schools. They strength-
ened our communities.
b 1615
We had a hearing of examples of
Dreamers, these young people who did
extraordinary things, who enriched the
lives of their own communities, who
are scholars, community activists,
teachers, doctors, and lawyers, people
making incredible contributions.
I have met with Dreamers in my
home State, where 6,000 people will be
protected by this legislation. They are
valued and productive members of our
community.
There is also protection in here for
TPS designees. In the State of Rhode
Island, we have the largest Liberian
community, who make unbelievable
contributions and live with such uncer-
tainty.
We, of course, need comprehensive
immigration reform, but protecting
Dreamers is first.
We have heard a lot of arguments
about other problems with our immi-
gration system. We agree, but I haven’t
heard anyone say that these young
people don’t deserve protection in this
debate today.
This bill doesn’t solve all the prob-
lems, but it solves three specific prob-
lems: TPS, DED, and Dreamers. It is
voting to give protections to these
young people.
This is a very powerful symbol of our
patriotism and our love of our country
because we are a stronger and better
America because of these young people
and because of the magnificent con-
tributions of these Dreamers. There is
nothing more American than passing
the Dream Act and ending the uncer-
tainty in the lives of these young peo-
ple and acknowledging they represent
the best of America.
I wish everyone in this country could
have watched that hearing of just some
examples of the differences these
young people have made in the lives of
their communities.
Let’s do the right thing. Let’s pass
this in a bipartisan way and give cer-
tainty to the lives of these young peo-
ple who know no other country but this
great country.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I agree with the gentleman, the
speaker, Mr. CICILLINE. I agree with
him that we need to fix this, but this is
not the way to fix this. There is a bi-
partisan way to fix this, and this sim-
ply just gives a green light.
It is a powerful symbol. This bill is a
very powerful symbol to those who
want to come here and know that there
will be no consequence for coming and
will continue to overload our border.
That is the symbolism that comes from
this bill today.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.
GROTHMAN).
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, our
immigrants have always been our fu-
ture. Wave after wave of moral, patri-
otic, hardworking, and law-abiding im-
migrants have kept America vibrant.
Today, the majority party intends to
put another 2 to 3 million people on the
path to citizenship.
I think it is accurate to say that
America does want some form of relief
for some DACA folks and some way to
make them made legal, but this bill
would do a lot. This bill, in my mind,
would ruin America.
First of all, I think America would
want to restrict this bill to the law-
abiding, including law-abiding DACA
folks. This bill does not do that. You
can commit two crimes and still be
here. You can be on a list of gang mem-
bers and still be here.
As far as self-supporting, this bill
doesn’t begin to deal with the problem
of people who are already taking ad-
vantage of our generous welfare safety
net. They are going to be staying here
under this bill.
Like I said, you can already be on a
variety of public assistance programs;
it is not dealt with. You can be a bad
role model for your kids; it is not dealt
with. You don’t have to learn English.
People always say: Oh, all the DACA
members all know English. That is not
true. You do not have to learn English
and you are set on a path to citizen-
ship.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4282 June 4, 2019
We can continue the divisive policy
of having people who come here ille-
gally and once made legal get pref-
erences over people who are here native
born.
I was in Texas last week, Mr. Speak-
er. As you know, we have over 100,000
people streaming across our border
every month. The majority party does
nothing about this.
Yesterday, we passed another welfare
bill continuing another, to a large ex-
tent, failed welfare program, but we do
nothing in that bill to make sure the
current welfare programs aren’t being
abused by illegal or legal immigrants.
That is what we should be focusing on
at this time.
A lot of people have been trying to
destroy America over many years. Go
back 100 years, and people realized
America is the light of the world.
America is the hope for civilization. If
I wanted to destroy America, I would
craft a bill like this. I would craft a bill
saying that we have got people here on
the welfare system, path to citizenship;
criminal background, path to citizen-
ship; and we put these folks ahead of so
many wonderful, hardworking people
who are trying to do the system the
right way and trying to come here le-
gally.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. CORREA), who is a member
of our Judiciary Committee.
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, if I may
call your attention to this poster here
to my right. This is a photo of brave
Americans out of Orange County who
have made the ultimate sacrifice since
9/11. Among them are Navy SEAL Mi-
chael Monsoor, Army Ranger Sergeant
Tyler Holtz, and right here in the mid-
dle is a picture of Corporal Jose Angel
Garibay, a Dreamer and a marine with-
out status who joined the Marine Corps
and made the ultimate sacrifice in 2003.
Later on, he was given American citi-
zenship posthumously. This is a
Dreamer, Jose Angel Garibay.
I want to also take a moment to talk
about another Dreamer, Police Officer
Germain Martinez Garcia, who grew up
in southern Illinois. In the words of his
police chief:
Germain is a part of our community. He’s
a good citizen. He’s a good person, and we
need him.
He is a Dreamer.
Two other Dreamers are two broth-
ers, John and James, who both grew up
in L.A. They are both Dreamers. They
joined the U.S. Army last year, and
they are out in basic training right
now. These two want nothing more
than to defend our country, and today’s
legislation will ensure that these both-
ers, John and James, can come home to
the United States after serving our
country.
Another Dreamer, Gloria, grew up in
the center of my district, Santa Ana.
She is a Dreamer who attended Har-
vard and is now getting her Ph.D. at
Claremont University.
All these are Dreamers, and for the
life of me, I don’t understand how these
individuals do not add to the greatness
of America.
Dreamers have been vetted. Dream-
ers are hardworking. They pay taxes;
they follow the law; and many, many
of them are defending our country all
over the world.
Mr. Speaker, let’s give Dreamers the
opportunity to earn the American
Dream. I ask for a vote of ‘‘aye’’ on
H.R. 6.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman
from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT), who is a mem-
ber of our committee.
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
I claim the time in opposition to this
very flawed piece of legislation here
this afternoon. It is flawed in many
ways.
First of all, it doesn’t do anything to
get more control at our southern bor-
der. We have thousands of people
streaming across that border in various
places on the border. It does nothing
about that.
It does nothing to improve on our
asylum system, which is very flawed
right now.
The drug cartels make huge amounts
of money by the people who are coming
in illegally. They are told the magic
words, which are basically to say that
they fear if they return to their coun-
try, so they are let into our country.
They are put on a bus or they are put
on a plane and shipped somewhere
around the country, to some city. They
are given a court date 2 years out, 3
years out, 5 years out. Very seldom do
they show up for that court date, so
they basically disappear into the popu-
lation.
This legislation does nothing to re-
form our asylum laws or to protect the
American people. It does nothing to ba-
sically protect folks around the world
who are trying to come here the right
way.
The DACA amnesty program which is
being created here will allow people to
cut in front of the line for people who
are trying to do it the right way.
Not only does it not do things to im-
prove the existing law—and it cer-
tainly doesn’t do it in a bipartisan
manner—but it is dangerous, and I will
tell you why.
In the Judiciary Committee—I have
been on that committee for many years
now—I offered an amendment. I think
we all know that far too many people
are killed or injured in this country by
drunk drivers, by people who have, in
some States they call it a DUI, in some
States they call it a DWI, driving, basi-
cally, impaired, either drugs or alco-
hol.
I offered a commonsense amendment
which said, basically, that you would
not be eligible for this if you were con-
victed—not just that you have driven,
but you were convicted—of drunk driv-
ing and you either killed a person or
the person was seriously injured. Seri-
ous bodily harm could be loss of an eye
or a limb. Or, if you had multiple DUIs,
two or more DUIs, you wouldn’t be eli-
gible for these.
All the Republicans on the com-
mittee voted for it; all the Democrats
voted against it.
Mothers Against Drunk Driving,
MADD, indicates that there are over
10,000 people killed every year in Amer-
ica by drunk drivers. Over 300,000 every
year are injured by drunk drivers.
In my amendment, we are talking
about people convicted of it. Mothers
Against Drunk Drivers indicates, for
every time a person is convicted, on av-
erage, they think they have probably
driven drunk 80 times.
So we are allowing folks to be eligi-
ble for this program. All the Democrats
on the committee voted against this
amendment that would have basically
made us safer in this country against
drunk drivers. But they refused to go
along with that, so I think it is really
dangerous to pass it. It could have been
much safer.
The people who are injured are our
sons. They are our daughters, wives,
spouses, brothers, sisters, mothers, and
fathers. But this bill doesn’t make
them safer. It had an opportunity to do
so, but all my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle voted against it.
That is just one reason why I think
this is a very flawed bill, and I would
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on
this bill.
We could, in a bipartisan manner, ac-
tually do something for these Dream-
ers, these DACA folks, but Democrats
said: No, we are not going to do this bi-
partisan. We are going to ram this
thing through.
It is really unfortunate because we
could have done something good for the
country, but that is not what this bill
does.
I thank the gentleman for yielding.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, may I
inquire how much time remains on
each side.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California has 303⁄4 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from
Georgia has 201⁄4 minutes remaining.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER). The majority leader
has been such a supporter of Dreamers
for these many years.
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentlewoman for yielding. More
than that, I thank her for the thou-
sands of hours that she has put in over
the years in trying to address in a posi-
tive, constructive way our broken im-
migration system and for her leader-
ship in forging a bill that is a step—
just a step.
I want to thank Mr. NADLER, the
chairman of the committee, for ensur-
ing that this bill came forward.
Mr. Speaker, I have been sitting here
for a few minutes, and I have heard a
number of my Republican colleagues
bemoaning the fact that we could have
done this in a bipartisan fashion and
come with up with a much better bill.
Many of those folks who said that have

been serving here over the last 8 years
in the majority, and we have been
pleading with them over those 8 years:
Bring us a bill, a bipartisan bill.
Mr. Speaker, as you so well know,
you and Mr. HURD, a Republican from
Texas, worked tirelessly in fashioning
a bipartisan bill, and the Republicans
refused to bring it to the floor; al-
though, in my view it had a majority of
votes on this floor.
Indeed, it was about to be petitioned
out of the committee and brought to
the floor in a process that you can do
that without the committee’s voting
for it. Just short of the 218 votes nec-
essary to do that, the Republican lead-
ership put all sorts of pressure to as-
sure that that bill was not discharged
from the committee.
So spare me the crocodile tears about
a bipartisan bill. We tried to do a bi-
partisan bill. The Senate did a bipar-
tisan bill in 2013, and we pleaded for
the Republicans to bring it to the floor,
a bipartisan Senate bill, and they re-
fused, all the time saying the immigra-
tion system was broken. But they re-
fused to fix it.
b 1630
So, now they come to the floor, be-
moaning the fact that a bipartisan bill
did not come forward. If they had in-
tended to work on a bipartisan bill, as
the majority leader, I will tell you, Mr.
Speaker, a bipartisan bill would have
come forward.
So sad, so unfortunate that that
didn’t happen.
Mr. Speaker, I want to read some-
thing:
‘‘We’re going to work something out
that’s going to make people happy and
proud.
‘‘They’’—referring to the Dreamers—
‘‘got brought here at a very young
age’’—1, 2, 3 years of age.
‘‘They’ve worked here. They’ve gone
to school here. Some were good stu-
dents. Some have wonderful jobs. And
they’re in never-never land because
they don’t know what’s going to hap-
pen.’’
Who said that? Donald Trump said it.
When did he say it? After he was
elected, but before he was sworn in as
President of the United States.
I met with the President, along with
a few others, at the White House, and
he said to us: ‘‘Send us a bill,’’ then he
created the problem we are confronting
today. And he said: ‘‘Congress, fix it,
and I will sign it.’’
Well, today, Mr. Speaker, we are fix-
ing it. And I hope that my Republican
colleagues would join us and that the
President of the United States would
sign a bill which will take these folks
out of never-never land.
The bill we have on the floor today is
called the American Dream and Prom-
ise Act—the American dream and
American promise.
We lift our lamp beside the golden
door. That is what we have said to the
world. That dream is to see hard work
rewarded with opportunity.
My father came here at the age of 32
in 1934, an immigrant from Denmark.
That promise is the commitment of our
Founders and every generation since to
ensure that this Nation makes that
dream a reality for all.
Today, more than a million people
who grew up in America don’t know
any other home, yet they live in fear of
being sent to a home they never knew.
They live in fear of being deported to
countries they never or barely knew.
These Dreamers, these yearners for
justice and opportunity, deserve to live
without fear. They deserve to access
the opportunities of America that they
have been helping to build already—a
Nation of immigrants, made great by
immigrants.
This bill will remove that fear. It will
give them the opportunity to stay in
the country they know and love and to
know their hard work and contribu-
tions will give them a chance to make
it in America and that they can give
back by serving in our military or cre-
ating jobs or working in their commu-
nities; that they can have a pathway to
citizenship, which is in their interest
and in the interest of our country.
This bill will keep the promise of our
Founders and our forebears, and it will
keep the promise of policymakers from
both sides of the aisle who agree they
should stay, along, I might add, with 86
percent of the American people.
They are American in every sense.
They are patriots and dreamers.
President Trump campaigned on a
promise to help Dreamers—a promise
he broke. It was President Trump who
created the crisis we now face by re-
scinding the DACA program 2 years
ago and allowing the Republican-con-
trolled House to stand in the way of a
legislative solution.
Now, the Democrat-led House is tak-
ing action. With this bill, we proclaim
to the Senate and President: Take the
advice of the American people. Pass
this bill.
For these Dreamers are, in all but a
certificate of citizenship, brothers and
sisters.
One of them from my district, Gabby
Hernandez, is here today, Mr. Speaker,
to watch us take this important vote.
She arrived in this country from El
Salvador at the age of 4. She attended
school in Prince George’s County,
Maryland, which I represent, and she
has been studying these last few years
to be a social worker and help people in
our community.
I hope we can give Dreamers like
Gabby reassurance that their country,
America, will not abandon them.
In addition, this bill would also allow
those who have been on temporary pro-
tected status and deferred enforced de-
parture to remain as permanent resi-
dents.
One of them has a business in my dis-
trict. He employs 40 people. Forty fam-
ilies would be affected by his leaving.
He has been here for 25 years. He is, in
every sense, a member of our commu-
nity.
These are people who fled a natural
disaster and violence and were wel-
comed into our country as refugees.
Here, they have helped build a stronger
community and have participated in
building our economy.
I am proud to represent a strong
community of Liberians in my district,
many of whom fled war and disease
outbreak and built new lives here. We
should not allow them to be uprooted
from their homes a second time.
Some of them are here today in the
gallery as well.
Let’s show them. Let’s show them
that we stand together with them and
cherish their contributions to America.
Whether we are Irish or Danish or
Italian or Jews or Poles or Germans,
all who came here in great numbers
immigrated to this country and have
made us great.
This bill is not perfect. No bill is per-
fect. But it is a step, a very important
step, a down payment on fulfilling that
promise.
But change happens most often in
steps, and today the Democrat-led
House is taking that step forward by
keeping our promise to Dreamers.
I want to thank LUCILLE ROYBAL-
ALLARD, NYDIA VELÁZQUEZ, YVETTE
CLARKE, JERRY NADLER, and—yes, once
again—ZOE LOFGREN for all the work
that they have done to get us to a
place where we have a fair bill—not
amnesty, a fair bill for America.
I hope my Republican colleagues will
join us in voting for this bill. Together,
let’s send a message of inclusion and
acceptance of these Dreamers, whose
dreams are the same as ours, whose pa-
triotism is the same as ours, and whose
Nation is the same as ours.
Vote ‘‘aye.’’ Vote for America.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from ref-
erences to occupants of the gallery.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may
consume.
Mr. Speaker, I always appreciate the
majority leader coming down. It is
amazing to me, though, that as we
come down and talk about this bill, if
there really was a desire to have a bi-
partisan bill, then maybe we would
have brought the bill that actually did
get close, as the gentleman did bring
up last Congress, and actually ask
some of those cosponsors on the Repub-
lican side who were sponsoring it last
time to be a part, who have said they
have been froze out.
Let’s face reality. So spare me the
discussion on getting a bipartisan bill
and the disdain for it and saying that
this bill actually helps.
This is a bill written for a promise,
as was just said. Let’s, at least, be hon-
est about why it was written and the
fact that it will not help the situation
on the border and, frankly, is not going
to help us get a bill passed, because
this will not pass because, as the Presi-
dent has said, he wants to see some se-
curity attached to this, so that we have
a safe and secure legal immigration
system.

Mr. Speaker, I would agree with him.
Spare me those discussions because
that didn’t happen here, as is painfully
obvious.
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO).
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I have the
utmost respect for the majority leader.
What I see as a problem here, that we
see over and over again, is finger point-
ing.
Yes, we did have the majority and
the Republican Party didn’t do any-
thing. But the Democrats had the ma-
jority back in President Obama’s first 2
years; they did nothing. But fingers get
pointed. Nothing gets done.
I rise today in opposition to this bill,
but that is not to say I am against
legal immigration. In fact, I don’t be-
lieve anyone in this Chamber or up in
the gallery, even though we can’t ref-
erence them, is against legal immigra-
tion.
I have repeatedly stated that I want
to find a solution for the Dreamers,
those kids who, through no fault of
their own, were brought to the United
States as children, illegally.
I support providing a method for
those who have registered under the
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
program, or DACA, to obtain legal sta-
tus. However, this must only be done in
coordination with measures completely
fixing our Nation’s broken border.
We have to have border security and
the enforcement of current immigra-
tion law or we can’t go forward, be-
cause a vacuum is turned on and more
people will come.
Without enhancing border security
and addressing the loopholes in our im-
migration system, this bill simply en-
courages more illegal immigration.
There is a cause-and-effect process
that does occur. If borders are open,
they are overrun, and immigration
laws aren’t enforced. Guess what?
There is more illegal immigration.
There is a crisis at our southwest
border, and this year we have seen ap-
prehensions of people illegally entering
at the border increasing every month.
For instance, in January of 2019,
there were approximately 49,000; in
April of 2019, 99,000. The numbers are
going to continue to go up because the
word is out, as Mr. COLLINS said, if you
get to the U.S. southwest border, you
will get amnesty.
That is unfortunate. The 99,000 in
April are only the crossings that we
know about.
Let’s look at why this is a crisis. It is
because the previous administration
created an illegal program called
DACA.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield the gentleman from Florida
an additional 30 seconds.
Mr. YOHO. It has created a problem
in Congress.
What we have to do, if my colleagues
on the other side are serious about
finding a fix for this problem, for our
broken immigration system: Let’s
work together and agree that, without
border security, this will not work.
Let’s fix this broken system once and
for all. Let’s do what is best for Amer-
ica because, if we do what is best for
America, is that not best for the immi-
grants, too?
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Texas (Ms. GARCIA), a valued member
of our Judiciary Committee.
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I
thank our chair, our leadership, and,
particularly, NANCY PELOSI for making
sure that this bill was a priority bill.
For me, I have dedicated a great part
of my life in public service to helping
immigrants who come to the United
States in search of a prosperous and
dignified life.
Today, I am honored to participate in
this historic day in the House of Rep-
resentatives.
Since 2001, when the DREAM Act was
first conceived, Dreamers have waited.
In 2012, DACA enabled eligible young
adults to work lawfully, attend school,
and contribute to society without the
constant fear of deportation.
DACA, however, does not provide a
path to citizenship, and it leaves out a
huge number of deserving Dreamers.
Now, in 2019, they are still waiting.
They are Americans in waiting. Right
now, Dreamers live in fear of being de-
ported to countries they may never
have known, don’t remember, or don’t
know at all, countries with which they
have little or no personal connection.
And, because of their status, most
Dreamers have never left the United
States, never having had the oppor-
tunity to know their places of origin
and never knowing any other place to
call home other than the American
communities in which they grew up.
Some don’t even know another lan-
guage other than English.
Opponents of this bill fail to realize
that it is not just about the Dreamers.
It is also their families that would be
harmed by mass deportations. It is
their employers who would lose key
members of their workforce. It is their
communities who would lose vital
members of their community.
It bears repeating: Dreamers are
American in every way except on
paper. In their hearts, in their minds,
and in their souls, they are Americans.
They are Americans in waiting.
Many have been in this country for
decades, becoming business owners,
employers, and homeowners.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. BURGESS).
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank
the gentleman for yielding.
As the majority leader gave his re-
marks a few moments ago, I was re-
minded that, in December of 2010, I was
in this House of Representatives and,
during a lameduck session, the House
of Representatives had, at that time, a
sizable Democratic majority. They had
lost the majority in the 2010 election,
so it was the waning hours of the
Democratic majority, and they passed
what was then known as Senator DUR-
BIN’s DREAMer bill here in the House
of Representatives.
b 1645
It went over to the Senate, and
Democrats had a 59–41 majority in the
United States Senate, and the Dreamer
bill failed to achieve cloture, not be-
cause it was blocked by Republicans.
Three Republicans voted with the then-
majority Democrats to move the bill
along. Senator Lugar, no longer with
us, Senator MURKOWSKI, who is still
with us, and Senator Bennett from
Utah, voted in favor of moving that bill
along.
Five Democrats voted against clo-
ture, and that was the reason why, in
the waning days of President Obama’s
first 2 years, as the Democratic major-
ity was winding down its term, that
that bill did not pass.
But this bill before us today—and I
felt so compelled to come and talk
about this because we have a serious
problem in the lower Rio Grande Val-
ley sector on our Texas-Mexico border.
There are parts of that border where
there is not a single stick of barrier
and, as a consequence, the number of
people coming over—you have read the
headlines, you have heard the statis-
tics that have been talked about here
today, 100,000 a month.
I serve on the Committee on Energy
and Commerce. We have the Office of
Refugee Resettlement under our juris-
diction in the Health Subcommittee.
The men and women there do a tremen-
dous job. They do everything we ask.
I visited one of their facilities last
week, Casa Padre, down in Brownsville,
Texas; 1,380 children under their care.
That number has stayed fairly con-
stant since my previous visit last July.
They get some kids in, they move some
kids out, and it is a steady state.
But at the border station in McAllen,
it is a different story. They have no
control over how many come in.
Yes, the law says that within 72
hours—it is purely a processing cen-
ter—they are to move, particularly
children, out of their center and off to
the OOR facilities. But if there is no
place to receive them then they can-
not. And OOR, by law, cannot receive
more children than they are allowed to
receive.
They closed the surge facility up in
Tornillo by El Paso during the sum-
mer, so there is no place else to go.
I have got to tell you, the men and
women who work for the Customs and
Border Patrol in the State of Texas in
the lower Rio Grande Valley sector,
overwhelmed is not a strong enough
word. They are burnt out. They have
been taking care of so many people for
so long, and they are asking, Where is
the United States Congress? Why will
we not reform the asylum laws that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4285
June 4, 2019
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. STANTON), a member of the
Judiciary Committee.
Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in strong support of H.R. 6, the
American Dream and Promise Act of
2019.
For so many, this day is a long time
coming. It would not be possible with-
out so many amazing people and orga-
nizations, including in my home State
of Arizona, who never stopped fighting,
who never gave up hope on this dream.
We are here today to pass a bill that
will provide permanent protections and
a pathway to citizenship for our
Dreamers, a solution that is long over-
due, one that will lift up 2 million peo-
ple across our Nation. For many, giv-
ing them a permanent place in the only
home, the only country that they have
ever known.
But this bill does more than the right
thing. It does a smart thing. Make no
mistake, this is an economic stimulus
bill. The economic gains in commu-
nities across the country will be sig-
nificant, and fewer stand to benefit
more than my community.
The Phoenix metro area ranks among
the top areas that will experience real
economic benefit from the passage of
this bill. When we bring stability to el-
igible immigrants, we bring stability
to our local economies as well.
The American Dream and Promise
Act of 2019 is a case of doing both the
right thing for people and doing the
right thing for our economy.
Dreamers are an integral part of our
community, our neighbors, our co-
workers, our friends. They are woven
into the social and economic fabric of
our entire region, and we have a re-
sponsibility to make sure that they
can continue to contribute and partici-
pate fully without fear.
When our Dreamers succeed, our
communities will be stronger.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Florida (Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL), a
member of our committee.
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Mr.
Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R.
6, the American Dream and Promise
Act of 2019.
Almost half of the people in my dis-
trict were born in a country other than
the United States, including myself. I
did not have the great privilege of
being born into this incredible Nation.
But my story is not unique. My story,
and every immigrant’s story, is the
American story. It is who we are as a
country.
Dreamers, DED holders, TPS, and
DACA recipients, are Americans in
every single way but on paper; and it is
time that we change that.
Protecting these Americans is not
only the right thing to do, but it also
makes economic sense.
In my district alone, Dream and
Promise households contribute over $53
million in Federal taxes and have a
spending power of over $271 million.
These Americans are our friends, our
neighbors, and our coworkers. They are
teachers, doctors, farmers. They rep-
resent our Nation’s commitment to
hard work.
To every Dreamer, DED holder, TPS
and DACA recipient with us here and
across the country, I want you to
know, we see you. We hear you. Your
fight is our fight.
Today, we will pass the American
Dream and Promise Act of 2019 and
give all these Americans the protec-
tions that they deserve.
I urge my colleagues to support H.R.
6.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman
from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT).
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, we
heard earlier some comments from the
other side about, gee, what could have
been done, and the desire for a bipar-
tisan agreement on things. And yet, I
know since President Trump came into
office, he offered a deal to work out le-
galization for folks that had been
granted DACA, and that offer was
slapped down.
So it is interesting to hear now, after
the opportunity did present itself in
the last Congress, with Republicans in
control in the House and Senate, and
the President, wanting to work some-
thing out in a bipartisan manner, now,
we hear, oh, we wanted it bipartisan all
along.
Well, a problem with a self-governing
nation is that when people abandon the
rule of law in that self-governing na-
tion, it is not going to remain self-gov-
erning that much longer.
What has made America strong was
that—one of the things—that nobody
was above the law. That included
Presidents, it included most everybody.
There were exceptions.
But as I have continued to say for a
number of years, we should seal—not
seal, but we should control the border,
get it secured, continue to give over a
million visas a year. Fine. Most gen-
erous country in the world when it
comes to allowing access, ingress and
egress. Continue that, but control the
border.
And once the border is controlled, we
can work out about what to do about
the people that came in illegally. We
can work that out.
Some try to slam Republicans and
say, oh, you must hate Hispanics. They
don’t know our hearts. They don’t
know my heart.
The huge majority of Hispanics I
know, they love God, they are devoted
to their family, and they have an in-
credibly hard work ethic. I think those
are three things, three components
that help, really, make America a
great country, the greatest I believe in
the world. We need more of that. That
is a great thing. But the immigration
has to be legal.
Now, this bill, though, we had a rule
shoved through, no amendments were
going to be allowed. Not only is this
not going to be a bipartisan effort to
work out an agreement from both
sides, we are slamming this through.
We are not letting any amendments.
And there were clearly problems with
the bill. For example, my amendment
would have helped stop gang members
from being given legalization. No. No.
That got voted down.
And not only was the amendment
voted down, under the bill, the Sec-
retary cannot consider the fact that we
have information in our database that
clearly shows that someone is a gang
member. Oh, no.
Not only that, the Secretary, under
this bill, is prohibited from getting
help to go through and review evidence
of who is a gang member and who isn’t.
That would mean hundreds of thou-
sands of people would have to be con-
sidered by the Secretary individually.
That is no mistake. They knew the
Secretary could not do that. So they
were going to get as many gang mem-
bers in as can possibly come in. And
there will be disputes over who came in
when. That is an ongoing issue.
But if a gang member is denied under
this program, then all the other appli-
cants, will have to pay a fee that will
pay for the gang member’s lawyer to
sue in Federal court.
Look, it is clear what is going on.
One party thinks their future as the
only party, as the majority party, will
be to get as many felons voting as pos-
sible and get as many people in here
beholden to the Democratic Party, le-
gally, illegally, whatever.
But the tragedy continues to go on at
the border. Every time we mention le-
galization, amnesty, DACA, Dreamers,
all of those things, the Border Patrol
made clear, people flood in illegally.
Let’s do the right thing. Let’s vote
‘‘no’’ on this and work something out
when the border is secure.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2
minutes to the gentlewoman from
Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR), a member of our
Judiciary Committee.
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in strong support of H.R. 6, the
American Dream and Promise Act of
2019.
This bill would provide Dreamers,
TPS holders, and DED recipients with
the relief and certainty that they and
our country need in order to thrive.
I would like to congratulate the ar-
chitects of this bill, Representatives
ROYBAL-ALLARD, VELÁZQUEZ, and
CLARKE, who worked so tirelessly, as
well as our Judiciary Committee
Chairman NADLER, and our Immigra-
tion and Citizenship Subcommittee
Chairwoman LOFGREN for the tireless
work that they put into this.
This bill has the potential to help
hundreds of thousands of hardworking
individuals who are American in every
way except on paper.
I am so proud that Texas has the sec-
ond highest Dreamer population in the
Nation, including the more than 9,000
Dreamers in the safe border commu-
nity of El Paso, Texas.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4286 June 4, 2019
My colleagues on the other side of
the aisle vacillate between arguments
intended to stall this legislation that
range from get in line, to build a wall,
to painting all undocumented immi-
grants as dangerous criminals that
Americans should fear. One of my col-
leagues even said that this bill would
destroy America.
I would like to remind them that
America is a nation of immigrants.
Dreamers, TPS holders, and DED re-
cipients are our friends, neighbors, and
colleagues. Some have even bravely
served in the military, and others are
pillars within communities across the
Nation.
They have built good lives here,
started families, created small busi-
nesses, employed thousands of people,
paid their taxes, made our country bet-
ter.
b 1700
I stand with Dreamers and TPS hold-
ers and will do all I can to ensure that
they are shielded from deportation and
have a pathway to citizenship.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
be on the right side of history and sup-
port this bill.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman
from Arkansas (Mr. HILL).
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman from Georgia for
yielding time.
Mr. Speaker, it is sad that I rise
today in opposition to H.R. 6. It brings
me no pleasure, for I support an equi-
table solution for our Nation’s Dream-
er population, but this bill goes well
beyond that kind of a balanced, equi-
table solution and, in fact, puts illegal
immigration ahead of legal immigra-
tion.
While we are a nation of immigrants,
it is true, we are a nation of laws as
well. Once again, the majority has
failed to find common ground on this
topic in this House.
Last year at this time we worked
mightily, when in the majority, to try
to find common ground, with Bob
Goodlatte’s effort of last summer, our
former chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee. He, too, could not find full bi-
partisan common ground, and barely
common ground among Republicans,
but common ground we must find, and
this bill, Mr. Speaker, is not that.
One example of why: legal Dreamers.
These are kids of work permit holders
in America from countries like India
and China who can’t get green cards
due to arbitrary country caps in our
immigration laws. Their kids have to
self-deport when they turn 18 years old.
Why aren’t these kids being dealt
with and protected? Their parents fol-
lowed the rules, came to the United
States the right way with a legal work
permit, and yet with this bill, we are
going to reward those who came ille-
gally, through no fault of their own for
the kids, and not protect those who are
here legally.
Mr. Speaker, that is not right.
Last year, House Republicans and the
President offered equitable solutions
for Dreamers in exchange for much-
needed asylum reforms, family unifica-
tion at the border, and border security
funds, but, sadly, as noted, the floun-
dering majority in this House can’t
find that compromise, can’t find that
common ground.
In my view, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6 is an
insincere bill with no chance of being
signed into law.
Mr. Speaker, I call on you to stop the
messaging bills and negotiate with Re-
publicans in the minority to fix our
broken immigration system.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from Or-
egon (Ms. BONAMICI).
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
strong support of the American Dream
and Promise Act, to stand with the
thousands of Dreamers across the
country and in Oregon, Dreamers like
Gustavo and Brenda, who are living in
and serving in our community.
Gustavo graduated from Forest
Grove High School. He knew he was in-
eligible for Federal student aid, yet he
found a way to go to college because he
knows that education cannot be taken
away from him.
Gustavo wrote: ‘‘I have found my
calling in the nonprofit work I do. I am
here to give back to the Latino com-
munity that believed in me and helped
me achieve my dream.’’
Brenda is an educator in Hillsboro,
Oregon. Last summer, her students
asked her: ‘‘Are you coming back next
year?’’ Despite uncertainty about her
status, Brenda will watch her students
graduate this Saturday, and she hopes
to continue supporting kids and fami-
lies in the very same school district
from which she graduated.
It is long past time for Dreamers like
Brenda and Gustavo, Americans in
every way except on paper, to live out
of the shadows. Mr. Speaker, I urge my
colleagues to support this legislation.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I inquire how much time is remain-
ing for both sides.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 71⁄4 minutes
remaining. The gentlewoman from
California has 211⁄4 minutes remaining.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LEE), my colleague.
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentlewoman for yielding,
but I also want to thank her for her
tireless and longstanding steadiness
and leadership in support of our
Dreamers.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support
of H.R. 6, which ensures the Dreamers,
temporary protected status recipients,
and individuals with deferred enforce-
ment departure status are protected
from deportation. This bill will also es-
tablish a path for 2.5 million people to
become lawful permanent residents.
These young people have lived in the
United States for decades and have
made a life for themselves and for their
families.
Now, let me be clear. Dreamers, TPS,
and DED recipients make our Nation
better. They are active members of our
community and contribute to our econ-
omy and make America a stronger na-
tion.
I am so proud to represent so many
Dreamers in my district. They are
American in every way except on
paper, and it is beyond cruel to deport
them to countries many of them barely
know.
By passing this bill today, House
Democrats are maintaining the prom-
ise of the American Dream to immi-
grants around the country.
It is time to protect our young peo-
ple, recognize their love for America,
and finally help their dreams come
true.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on
H.R. 6.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Ms. FRANKEL), a leader in this
movement.
Ms. FRANKEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank
my colleague for yielding and my col-
leagues who have brought this before
us today.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the
American Dream and Promise Act.
As a teen, Daniella had a dream, a
dream to be a lawyer. Her grandmother
had brought her here from Venezuela
when she was a small child, from a
place she barely knew and never re-
turned to.
Daniella learned English, made
friends, studied hard, and became an
honors student. When she applied for a
college scholarship, she learned for the
first time a family secret: she was un-
documented.
Disqualified from this scholarship
and with no money for college,
Daniella was devastated. Then, in 2012,
like for hundreds of thousands of young
people, the doorway to opportunity
opened. President Obama issued the
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
order. Daniella enrolled in college and
is now preparing for law school.
Mr. Speaker, today is a day that
walls come down and we show the
world that dreams like Daniella’s can
come true.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. PANETTA), my colleague
and neighbor in California.
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Chairwoman LOFGREN for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the
American Dream and Promise Act of
2019, but more importantly, for Dream-
ers and TPS recipients in my commu-
nity and all across our country.
As the Representative for the central
coast of California, this bill will affect
not just the lives of Dreamers and TPS
recipients, but the lives of people
throughout our communities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4287
June 4, 2019
In my district, there are nearly 20,000
Dreamers and thousands and thousands
of Salvadorian TPS recipients. These
are men and women who don’t just live
in my district; they work there; they
go to school there; they own homes
there; they have families there. They
are our loved ones; they are our
friends; they are our neighbors; they
are our employees. They are our com-
munity. They are our country.
As the grandson of immigrants who
grew up in this Nation of immigrants,
I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, the Dream-
ers and TPS recipients in my commu-
nity are filled with the spirit of this
country. They don’t just want to stay
here; they want to contribute here.
They want to give back to this commu-
nity and country that has given them
so much. They understand, they value,
they yearn to fulfill their obligations
as Americans in this democracy.
Mr. Speaker, let’s fulfill our obliga-
tion in Congress. Let’s do our job for
our communities by giving our Dream-
ers, our TPS recipients that oppor-
tunity for our country.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Texas
(Mr. DOGGETT).
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, ‘‘Does
anybody really want to throw out good,
educated, and accomplished young peo-
ple who have jobs, some serving in our
military? Really?’’
‘‘They have been in our country for
many years through no fault of their
own, brought in by parents at young
age.’’
Those were the words of a President
Trump tweet on September 14, 2017,
but, unfortunately, Donald Trump is a
man of his last tweet. Later, when a bi-
partisan group of Senators went to
meet with the President and present a
viable bipartisan plan, he flew into a
racist rant and refused to act.
Only because of Federal court orders,
consistently rejecting the Trump ad-
ministration arguments, do our Dream-
ers have any protection today.
I have visited personally with these
young people: a nurse, a teacher, a
county prosecutor, a key person in a
small business, many students. They
are contributing to our communities,
and America is stronger for their pres-
ence. They are Americans in every
sense except for the documents that
allow them to fully participate.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
time of the gentleman has expired.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
an additional 15 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Texas.
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, if pro-
tection for our Dreamers is terminated,
all of us will lose.
A coalition of Texas businesses has
estimated that Texas, alone, will lose
$6 billion in economic activity every
year.
Mr. Speaker, let’s provide our
Dreamers the certainty of a clear path
to citizenship. Let’s recognize them as
the full-fledged Americans they cer-
tainly are.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the
President.
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRIES
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, parliamentary inquiry.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, derogatory statements toward the
President; also, that was impugning
the integrity of the President. I think
that is much more beyond what was ac-
tually warned about, and I would ask
the Parliamentarian for a ruling on
that.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair is again reminding Members to
refrain from engaging in personalities
toward the President.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, further parliamentary inquiry.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, the parliamentary inquiry would
say that that statement, as quoted, ‘‘a
racist rant’’ is an attack on the Presi-
dent, implying he is a racist. Is that
not true? Which is contrary—
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair continues to remind Members
that they should refrain from engaging
in personalities toward the President.
The Chair will not issue an advisory
opinion.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, further parliamentary inquiry.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, is it not true that this House is run
on parliamentary language that is not
consistent with what was just used?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair will continue to enforce the rules
of decorum.
The gentleman from Georgia is rec-
ognized.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, the gentleman from Georgia con-
tinues that parliamentary inquiry,
then, because it is an issue that needs
to be addressed. It should not have
been said on this floor.
Mr. Speaker, with that, I reserve the
balance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. JUDY CHU), a leader on this
issue.
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr.
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.
6, the Dream and Promise Act.
This is a historic day. H.R. 6 provides
a long-awaited pathway to citizenship
for Dreamers, to temporary protected
status recipients, and deferred enforced
departure status individuals.
A floor vote on this bill could not
have come soon enough. More than 2.5
million immigrants currently living in
fear that they would be torn from their
families could find relief in this bill.
Losing them would be disastrous to
our communities, and it would harm
our economy. It would be devastating
to so many. This includes 130,000 Asian
American Dreamers and 9,000 TPS re-
cipients who urgently need relief from
the President’s xenophobic threats to
tear apart immigrant families.
The Dream and Promise Act unites
us around the shared ideal that any-
body can live the American Dream if
they are willing to work for it. That is
the lesson that has inspired genera-
tions of immigrants to build this coun-
try, and that is the lesson we cannot
afford to forget.
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this
bill.
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, parliamentary inquiry.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, here we go again. Now, it may not
matter to anyone else here, but the
Members who wear pins understand
that parliamentary language is impor-
tant and what rules this floor.
‘‘Xenophobic’’ is another word being
used on this floor about the President’s
character. Please advise how that is
parliamentary language.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair would again remind all Members
to refrain from engaging in personal-
ities toward the President.
b 1715
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I am
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Minnesota (Mr. PHILLIPS).
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I thank
my colleague for yielding.
Mr. Speaker, this bill is long overdue
in the U.S. and in my State of Min-
nesota.
In Minnesota we are home to a thriv-
ing community of Liberian refugees
who fled two civil wars and an Ebola
outbreak, refugees like my good friend,
Louise Stevens. She escaped civil war,
left her life behind, and slept on a
friend’s floor for over a year just for
the chance at the American Dream.
Now she is over 60. She has worked
hard in Minnesota’s healthcare indus-
try for 18 years. She is the mother of
American children. She pays taxes, and
she is here legally under DED. But be-
cause of that DED status, she still has
no path to citizenship. The same is
true for thousands of Liberians in
America.
I am so proud to help lead the Dream
and Promise Act and finally, at long
last, change that. That is the American
Dream and, at long last, it should be
our reality.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I continue to reserve the balance of
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4288 June 4, 2019
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I am
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr.
ESPAILLAT).
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, today
is a great day in our Nation as we live
up to our most noble and altruistic
ideals.
Today, by passing the American
Dream and Promise Act, we will again
reaffirm that we are still a Nation of
immigrants.
Today, we follow a great tradition
that goes back even before Ellis Island,
when hundreds of thousands of, mainly
European, immigrants from humble,
poor beginnings reached our shores in
an attempt to better their lives. They
made us a more perfect union,
strengthening the notion that we are
still a nation of immigrants.
With H.R. 6, young people and others
who are students, teachers, nurses,
caregivers, and members of our Armed
Forces will be able to fully embrace
the potential and live the American
Dream, reaffirming that the United
States of America is still a nation of
immigrants.
No one but two of our colleagues can
say otherwise. Whether from red States
or blue States, we all share an immi-
grant heritage in one way or another.
Some came by force, shackled to their
destiny, while others came fleeing vio-
lence, poverty, hunger, or in search of
liberty and religious freedom. So many
came to our Nation, and we are still,
Mr. Speaker, a Nation of immigrants.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I continue to reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I am
pleased to yield 1 minute to my col-
league from California (Mrs. TORRES).
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr.
Speaker, I rise also in strong support of
H.R. 6, the American Dream and Prom-
ise Act.
I recently met with a young Dreamer
from my district who asked me a sim-
ple question: Have you ever thought
about doing something to change some-
one else’s life?
Passing the American Dream and
Promise Act is that moment in his-
tory. This is a historic day for the mil-
lions of hardworking young people
who, like me, were brought to the U.S.
as children. And not just me, but many
other members of the new American
caucus who are serving in Congress
today. They built lives here. They own
businesses, homes, and cars. Many have
U.S. citizen children. They are not a
national security concern. These are
our neighbors and our friends who have
done everything that they could pos-
sibly do to be on the right side of the
law and on the right side of our com-
munities.
Immigrants make America great. I
urge passage.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I continue to reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I am
very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the
gentleman from Texas (Mr. CASTRO),
the chair of the Congressional Hispanic
Caucus.
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I
thank Representative LOFGREN for
yielding.
Mr. Speaker, the most powerful
movements in American history, those
that have made the most change in our
country, have often been started by
young people.
More than a dozen years ago, many
young Dreamers took to the streets of
cities like Los Angeles, Dallas, Chi-
cago, New York, and so many other
places throughout our country asking
that they be recognized fully as Ameri-
cans. Many of these are folks who were
brought here when they were 6 months
old, 5 years old, or 3 years old and have
only known the United States as their
home country.
Today, the House of Representatives
recognizes their Americanness and
takes a step forward to move them out
of the legal limbo in which they have
found themselves and, unfortunately,
in which they have lived their lives.
These are folks who are servicemem-
bers, they are teenagers, they are engi-
neers, and they are workers in the
fields. They are people who are pro-
ducing for our country, who are mak-
ing this Nation strong. They are people
who we can be proud of. They are, like
us, Americans. And today, most of all,
we give them something to celebrate as
we acknowledge their Americanness.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Speaker PELOSI
for her hard work. This is the second
time, under her tenure as Speaker,
that a Dream Act has passed. I thank
LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD, PRAMILA
JAYAPAL, and everybody on the Judici-
ary Committee who has also done the
hard work of shepherding this bill
through.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
vote for H.R. 6.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I continue to reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
minute to the gentleman from Illinois
(Mr. GARCÍA).
Mr. GARCÍA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker,
I thank Chairman NADLER and Chair-
woman LOFGREN for their leadership on
this important bill. This moment has
been years in the making, thanks in no
small part to the advocates, the allies,
and the young people who fought hard
for their right to stay in a country that
they call and consider home.
Let me be clear, the American Dream
and Promise Act is not perfect, but
there is a lot of good in it. This is a big
step forward.
That is why I offered amendments to,
first, prohibit juvenile adjudications
from being used to determine a public
safety risk, and, two, to eliminate all
references to gang databases or pre-
sumed gang affiliation from H.R. 6. It
didn’t make it, but it is still a great
compromise.
We cannot afford to turn our backs
now. We must pass H.R. 6 today, a sig-
nificant precedent by the House of Rep-
resentatives to create a pathway to
citizenship for millions.
Mr. Speaker, I thank everyone re-
sponsible for their contributions to
this piece of immigration reform.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I continue to reserve the balance of
my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I am
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. PELOSI),
my colleague, the Speaker of the
House.
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank
Congresswoman ZOE LOFGREN for yield-
ing and for her extraordinary leader-
ship.
Congresswoman LOFGREN has been an
immigration lawyer. She has taught
immigration law, and she has served
now as chair of the Subcommittee on
Immigration and Citizenship. She was
masterful in bringing elements to-
gether to make today possible. I com-
mend our distinguished chairman, Mr.
NADLER, for his leadership, and Con-
gresswoman JAYAPAL for making this
success possible.
But also, I commend Congresswoman
LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD. When we
passed this bill on the floor a long time
ago, it was her legislation. She is the
godmother—they are young god-
mothers—she is the godmother of this
legislation. And I commend Congress-
woman NYDIA VELÁZQUEZ, who was the
chair of the Hispanic Caucus when we
passed the bill the first time; Congress-
woman YVETTE CLARKE, who has been a
champion on this issue; Congress-
woman JUDY CHU, the chair of her cau-
cus; Congresswoman KAREN BASS of her
caucus; and Congressman JOAQUIN CAS-
TRO of the Hispanic Caucus—inside ma-
neuvering, but the outside mobilization
is what made today possible.
The stories of the Dreamers elevated
this issue, their stories told with such
dignity and patriotism for our country,
the mobilization that they evoked from
their stories for other people to take
up their cause and their case, because
it is so important to America. And
today, we are not only honoring and re-
warding our Dreamers, but we are also
addressing the temporary protected
status and DED recipients so that they
feel much safer.
A year ago, I stood on the floor of
this House—yes, in 4-inch heels, for 8
hours, if you want any more statis-
tics—and told many stories of our
Dreamers. I couldn’t yield because then
I would give up my time, so I told the
stories of Dreamers. These Dreamers
are the constant reinvigoration of
America.
Dreamers such as Fernando, who
lives in my district, came to the U.S.
when he was just 9 years old. He had an
excellent education, which I will sub-
mit for the RECORD. He now works at
UCSF—that would be the University of
California, San Francisco—Helen Diller
Family Comprehensive Cancer Center,
where he is working hard to provide
new insights into deadly diseases and
disorders.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4289
June 4, 2019
There are other stories to tell.
To our businesses and economy,
Javier came from Mexico City when he
was 5 and now employs hundreds of
Americans as CEO of an investment
firm.
To technology and innovation, Saba
came from Pakistan and is now a Ph.D.
candidate studying cancer and other
deadly genetic diseases.
And to our security, Andrea came
from Peru and is hoping to follow in
her father’s footsteps as a member of
the Air Force.
The list goes on and on. My colleague
from California, MIKE THOMPSON, is al-
ways bragging that, in California, 5,000
of our teachers are DACA, are Dream-
ers. We want to give back to them.
The courage, patriotism, and deter-
mination to succeed of those young
people strengthens our Nation and they
must be allowed to stay.
There is nothing partisan or political
about protecting Dreamers and TPS
and DED recipients.
If the Dream Act had been brought to
the floor in the last Congress under the
Republican majority and leadership, I
do believe that it would have passed
under a Republican majority by strong,
bipartisan support.
Every President in recent memory—
Democrat and Republican—has under-
stood the value of immigration to our
Nation.
In his last speech as President of the
United States, President Ronald
Reagan said he had an important mes-
sage to communicate to the country he
loves, and he went on to say: ‘‘Thanks
to each wave of new arrivals to this
land of opportunity, we’re a nation for-
ever young, forever bursting with en-
ergy and new ideas, and always on the
cutting edge, always leading the world
to the next frontier. This quality is
vital to our future as a nation.’’
President Reagan went on to say: ‘‘If
we ever closed the door to new Ameri-
cans, our leadership in the world would
soon be lost.’’
Today, our new Democratic House
majority is advancing that leadership
in the world, in a bipartisan way, hope-
fully, with the American Dream and
Promise Act.
We are pleased that this legislation
opens a door of opportunity to TPS and
DED recipients, who are American in
every way: raising families, starting
businesses, contributing to our commu-
nities, and fighting in our wars over
decades.
Once we pass this bill—we want it to
pass the Senate and be signed by the
President. We want it to be a bridge to
understand why we need comprehen-
sive immigration reform for an immi-
gration system that embraces the con-
tributions of our newcomers.
Protecting Dreamers and TPS and
DED Americans is about honoring the
respect for family that is at the heart
of our faith and at the heart of who we
are as Americans.
Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong, bipar-
tisan vote to pass this legislation, and
to safeguard every person’s right to
pursue his or her American Dream.
And to my colleagues, today, on the
floor of this House, we have the oppor-
tunity to be part of history, to be on
the right side of history, but, more im-
portantly, to be on the right side of the
future by voting and recognizing the
value of Dreamers to that future.
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

of approval or disapproval of pro-
ceedings is in violation of the rules of
the House.

Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, may I inquire as to how much time
each side has remaining.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 71⁄4 minutes
remaining. The gentlewoman from
California has 91⁄2 remaining.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I am
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself the balance of time,
and I appreciate the gentlewoman (Ms.
LOFGREN) and the ability to close.
Mr. Speaker, there is a saying some-
times, and it is ‘‘everything has been
said, just not everybody has said it.’’ I
think we sort of went through that
today.
But some of the things that have
been said today need to be brought out
and, I think, continue to be brought
out, and it may be that we don’t talk
about them.
What we have found here is that,
today, my colleagues clearly do not
care—as we have seen—about rule of
law. They don’t even seem to care
about the rules of the House today, and
they had to actually waive the paygo
rules in order to bring this bill to the
floor.
The estimate on this was $35 billion.
They have waived that. They said: We
don’t care. We have got a bill that is
going nowhere, a bill that is not going
to be signed. So I guess, just to make
our point, we are just going to waive
that.
But let’s talk a little bit about some
of the other stuff that is not in this
bill, that is not with DACA recipients,
or DACA, or the Dreamers—however, it
is described today—that many of us
would like to have seen.
I think it was very telling when the
majority leader came down here and
brought up a bill which I acknowledged
was very close to coming bipartisanly
and passing last year, but didn’t. If you
wanted a bipartisan bill, that is where
you would have started, and you would
have had an opportunity to actually
then put something with it with secu-
rity and actually get something passed.
But that was not what my friends
across the aisle wanted. They wanted,
it seems to me, a political bill, a state-
ment bill, something that will not get
passed but simply continue to use this
population, seemingly, in a way that
furthers political goals and not a real
solution.
An interesting part of this bill which
has not been talked about as much—it
has been mentioned, but it also needs
to be recognized. We have a serious
issue with this temporary protected
status, TPS. There is no T anymore. T
is not available in this. Temporary
does exist.
When we talk about this—and it is
supposed to be for those who are in dire
need. I agree with the concept of TPS,
that it should be there for those areas
and times when we need to allow peo-
ple to come in, and that should be a
part, and it should not be natural dis-
asters and other things. But I want you
to think for just a second—and this was
actually brought out in Rules last
night by my colleague from California,
whom I respect highly about this.
But understand, the TPS was granted
to El Salvador in March 2001; Haiti,
2010; Honduras, 1999—these were earth-
quakes, hurricanes—Nepal, 2015, an
earthquake; Hurricane Mitch in 1999,
with Nicaragua. Others were armed
conflicts, which we can understand.
But temporary after a hurricane, we
are looking at 15, almost 20 years and
we are still dealing with this, because
all we did in this body and all the ad-
ministration did was simply kick the
can down the road.
I feel for those who came here on a
temporary status but did not go home,
and then they got left. Yes, this has be-
come their home because we did not
obey the law.
Now, there has been a lot said also
about—and there is no need to con-
tinue on it because there is the ability
for criminal elements to get green
cards—the discussion about having the
Secretary of Homeland Security being
able to take these up; and an indi-
vidual, a nondelegable authority, to ac-
tually take these individual items up is
a farce. They don’t have that time or
ability.
They will never get that far because,
actually, amazingly, the Department of
Homeland Security Secretary is a busy
person, both female or male. Whoever
serves in it, under Republican or Demo-
crat, does not have time to do this. So
the very narrow exemption will never
get used. So, yes, it does open that pos-
sibility up.
But I think the interesting thing
here is, it was shown by some of the
discussion in this debate, it was beyond
the political rhetoric of a bill that is
going nowhere and a bill that should
and could find solutions.
It goes back to the problem that we
see right now that this is, frankly, an-
other green light to those who want to
come here seeking freedom from the
place that they currently are, which I
sympathize with. I understand. But ei-
ther we have a way to get into our
country legally or we don’t. Either we

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4290 June 4, 2019
have a way that you should come prop-
erly to our country or we don’t.
It is not an in-between item here. It
is not saying that we want you to come
but, yet, at the same point, don’t worry
about our rules and laws if you can
come.
As I said earlier in my statement
today, they are borrowing, renting, and
begging for children to walk across the
border because they know that, once
they do, they are free. Within 48 to 72
hours, they can get to an NGO and be
on a plane somewhere, even when we
have found over 3,000 cases of fraudu-
lent, unaccompanied minors and fam-
ily units. But we don’t address that
here.
In other words, we don’t talk about
what is happening in combination with
this, which many of us could have ac-
tually gotten on board with. We simply
put another green light, Mr. Speaker,
on the fact that we are not helping.
If either side, both Republicans or
Democrats, could look at a Border Pa-
trol agent or an ICE agent or one who
works in our immigration and port au-
thority and actually look at them and
tell them while they are doing their job
upholding the law, which is all they
can do—it is not their job to make
laws. That is this body’s job: to make
laws or to help them or to send them
aid.
Then how can we look them in the
eye when they are staying 15 and 20
hours away from their families each
day, when their own families are fall-
ing apart, because we are overcrowding
our Border Patrol offices because they
can’t hide them?
How do we explain to those who come
here properly on asylum from Cuba and
other places where they have been told,
as one told me, looked at me and said:
‘‘If I was to go back to Cuba, they
would disappear me,’’ how can we sit
there and look at them while they are
held for 60 or 90 days or longer, while
unaccompanied family members and
unaccompanied minors and family
units are being passed over within 24 to
48 hours as they are sitting there le-
gitimately trying to get into this coun-
try through an honest asylum claim?
But we sit them there to the side. We
don’t want to discuss them. We want to
make a political statement today.
So this will be a partisan vote. There
will be some bipartisan vote. There
may be some who will vote for it, and
that is okay. But at the end of the day,
we are not getting what we asked for.
We are not getting what we wanted. If
we did, we probably would have taken
the bill from last Congress. They did
have bipartisan votes, what the major-
ity leader spoke of. But that is not
what we did.
Until we get serious about this issue,
until we get serious about wanting to
fix this and not simply use debate time
to bash the administration or the
President and to find solutions here,
then we will continue down this path.
And you can celebrate if you pass
this—which you will because the ma-
jority has the numbers—but how hol-
low a celebration is something when
you look and say: This will not do any-
thing because this will not become law.
The powerful symbol spoken of by
one of my colleagues earlier is this.
The powerful symbol is not that you
can pass a bill on the floor that has
nothing of support from either side or
actually has the hope of becoming law,
or giving false hope to anyone who is
watching today, what actually has the
ability to do is that why would we do
this if we are not dealing with the
issues that we have as we go forward?
Why would we take the flaws in this
bill, bringing it to the floor in a closed
rule?
Why? Because I believe the majority
didn’t want to have to deal with the
honest problems in this bill with
amendments, so they closed the rule.
They didn’t want it to happen.
Mr. Speaker, but as this is our time,
this our place, I would urge a ‘‘no’’
vote on this bill, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield
myself such time as I may consume.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to correct
a couple of things that have been said
in the course of this debate.
Unfortunately, there are those in our
country who try and claim that immi-
grants are criminals, and that is really
incorrect. But for those who have said
that this bill was loose for people who
have committed serious crimes, it is
simply not the case. We have tough re-
strictions in this bill.
Under the bill, an applicant is dis-
qualified if any one of the following
apply:
There is reason to believe the appli-
cant is a national security risk;
The applicant has a felony conviction
of any kind other than immigration
status related;
The applicant has a single mis-
demeanor conviction involving moral
turpitude with a sentence of more than
6 months, whether or not that has been
served;
An applicant has two misdemeanors
involving moral turpitude, regardless
of sentence;
An applicant has more than two mis-
demeanors of any kind, excluding of-
fenses that should not bar anyone, like
minor traffic offenses; and
The applicant has a single mis-
demeanor conviction for domestic vio-
lence.
A lot has been said, I think, incor-
rectly, about the provision in the bill
that says the Secretary’s authority to
deny applicants who pose a threat to
public safety—and that is our failsafe
in this—the Secretary can deny an ap-
plicant if he determines, or she, that
the applicant poses a current threat to
public safety, that somehow that is un-
workable. But that is not true.
Let’s be clear. Members of Congress
are the only ones who can introduce
bills and sign letters. But do we do
every single aspect of that? Of course
not. We have staff who assist us.
That is how that would work in the
Department of Homeland Security. The
staff would help, and they would pre-
pare something for the Secretary, who
would not be able to delegate it. And
this is how it has worked in the Immi-
gration and Nationality Act before.
I draw your attention to INA’s 236(a),
which is the mandatory detention of
suspected terrorists at habeas corpus
and judicial review. This section pro-
vides that this decision cannot be dele-
gated, and yet it is workable because a
lot of the staff work is done to present
to the Secretary who, himself, must
make that decision; similarly, with
public law 110–301, the Libyan Claims
Resolution Act, and 8 U.S.C. 1522 that
provides nondelegable activities.
Now, there has been discussion that
somehow the language that we have in
the bill about databases means you
can’t use that evidence. That is simply
incorrect.
Mr. Speaker, if we had wanted to pre-
vent the Department of Homeland Se-
curity from using or referring to gang
databases, we would have said so. The
bill would clearly state that DHS could
not use, rely on, or refer to gang data-
bases. That is not what the bill says.
The bill says ‘‘it shall not establish
disqualifying gang participation.’’ It
can be evidence, but it can’t be the es-
tablishment of that fact.
Now, why would that be the case? We
value our law enforcement community.
They keep us safe. They are hard-
working. But these databases are popu-
lated by people way beyond law en-
forcement, people in school police,
school security. They can result in peo-
ple being mistakenly tagged as gang
members when they are not.
I will give an example.
There was an audit done of Califor-
nia’s gang database, CalGang. When
the auditors went through, they found
out there were 42 individuals who were
under the age of 1 year old who had al-
legedly self-reported that they were
part of a gang. Obviously, that was in-
correct. So we would not want to make
that the determining factor.
I want to mention a little bit about
the comments that were made about
DUI. DUI is a very serious matter, and
no one wants to see individuals who are
threats to public safety obtain relief
under this bill.
First, anyone who is convicted by an
offense punishable by a maximum term
of imprisonment of more than 1 year is
barred from relief. So anyone who
would commit a serious offense is
barred.
If you have one conviction for DUI
with a suspended license and you knew
your license was suspended, you have
committed a crime of moral turpitude,
because section 212 of the Immigration
and Nationality Act still applies.
Some have said that a single DUI
conviction should be enough to dis-
qualify you. Well, we have provided for
that as well. If the Secretary finds that
you pose a serious public safety threat,
he can deny your application.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4291
June 4, 2019
I will just say this. There are Mem-
bers of the House of Representatives
who have a single DUI. We didn’t exile
them from a single DUI, and I don’t
think if someone has turned their life
around, we should exile them as well.
Now, I want to talk about the value
of this bill.
It is interesting to hear the bill has
been jammed, because we have waited
for 18 years for this moment to pass
this bill.
b 1745
Mr. Speaker, over 400 diverse organi-
zations, associations, and industry
leaders support this bill, including
United We Dream, NAACP, National
Organization for Women, Interfaith Im-
migration Coalition, United States
Chamber of Commerce, and National
Education Association.
Yesterday, more than 100 business
leaders, including Walmart, Koch In-
dustries, Coca-Cola, Starbucks, and
General Motors all came out in support
of this bill. They had full-page ads in
The New York Times, asking us to
please pass this bill.
H.R. 6 is the solution we have been
waiting for. Passage of this measure is
long overdue. Dreamers and TPS and
DED recipients do not have the luxury
of time. President Trump terminated
DACA. He terminated TPS for six
countries. He extended DED only
through March 2020.
While the courts have stopped the
President on DACA and TPS, these in-
dividuals are living on borrowed time.
We can vote on their futures now. To
a great extent, we are deciding their
fates, and we are also deciding our
fates. Are we the America that made us
great, who opened our doors to those
who wanted to become Americans with
us, who understood that those who
have done no wrong should not receive
punishment? I say that we are.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
vote in support of the American Dream
and Promise Act of 2019, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, the treatment
of the Dreamers, brought to this country by
their parents and others with unsettled status,
is un-American and must be set right by the
rational process outlined by H.R. 6, the Amer-
ican Dream and Promise Act of 2019. The
Dreamers have come to symbolize the entire
group of individuals who have been left in the
shadows, where they experience the fear of
the hunted. The Dreamers have lived among
us for almost their entire lives. I have invited
Dreamers who live in the District of Columbia
to a public meeting to talk about their lives.
They are fulfilling their own dreams going to
college and working in good jobs.
The shame of our failure to permanently
settle the Dreamers question will not go away
as long as we leave them and others living
without settled legal status twisting in the
wind. H.R. 6 does not pretend to settle this
issue. Rather, it establishes a path to citizen-
ship not only for Dreamers but also for Tem-
porary Protected Status and Deferred En-
forced Departure holders.
Never before in American history have we
left any group of people in our country in legal
limbo. H.R. 6 presents the ordered and pre-
dictable process this issue has long needed.
These issues and these people will not go
away. The House has an obligation to use our
new majority to set this issue on the path to
resolution.
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today in support of the American Dream and
Promise Act. For too long, Congress has
failed to take action in providing certainty to
members in our community whose immigration
status has been thrown into question because
of the actions of this erratic administration.
With the passage of this important and sub-
stantial piece of legislation, we will be sending
a clear message to these individuals that they
are valued members of our communities.
This bill provides certainty to the roughly
14,600 DREAMers in my district, including
people like Juan Carlos Cerda. Juan Carlos
came to the United States at the age of 7 with
his mother from Mexico. Juan Carlos didn’t
understand completely what was going on at
the time—all he knew was that he and his
mother were leaving Mexico to join his father
in the United States. Juan Carlos worked hard
through school and eventually earned a B.A.
at Yale University. He returned to North Texas
as a kindergarten teacher in the Pleasant
Grove neighborhood in my district to con-
tribute back to the community that gave him
so much. Because of the uncertainty sur-
rounding the Deferred Action for Childhood Ar-
rivals program and the Trump Administration,
Mr. Cerda’s work authorization had a cloud of
uncertainty. This bill would lift that cloud and
allow people like Mr. Cerda to centime to be
contributing members in our diverse commu-
nities.
Furthermore, roughly 2,400 individuals
under Temporary Protected Status and De-
ferred Enforced Departure within my district
will also be protected under this legislation.
These individuals were granted refuge in the
United States while their home countries dealt
with issues such as natural disasters or civil
unrest. These individuals have been in the
United States for an average of 22 years and
have already set down roots within my district.
We know them as small business owners,
educators, community leaders, and friends.
These individuals along with DREAMers are
Americans, just like myself, the only difference
is what is written on a piece of paper.
Overall, up to 2.5 million people who have
spent most of their lives in the United States
will have a door of opportunity opened so that
they too can fulfill their vision of the American
dream. These individuals make our country
stronger and make valuable contributions to it
every day. As a cosponsor of this bill, I urge
my colleagues to support this legislation and

So (two-thirds being in the affirma-

resolution, as amended, was agreed to.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.
f
AMERICAN DREAM AND PROMISE
ACT OF 2019
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
BUTTERFIELD). Pursuant to clause 1(c)
of rule XIX, further consideration of
the bill (H.R. 6) to authorize the can-
cellation of removal and adjustment of
status of certain aliens, and for other
purposes, will now resume.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
MOTION TO RECOMMIT
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I have a
motion to recommit at the desk.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the
gentleman opposed to the bill?
Mr. CLINE. I am in its current form.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit.
The Clerk read as follows:
Mr. Cline moves to recommit the bill H.R.
6 to the Committee on the Judiciary with in-
structions to report the same back to the
House forthwith with the following amend-
ment:
Page 9, line 5, strike ‘‘or’’.
Page 9, line 19, strike the period at the end
and insert a semicolon.
Page 9, after line 19, insert the following:
(C) The Secretary knows or has reason to
believe that the alien is or has been a mem-
ber of a criminal street gang (as defined in
subsection (a) of section 521 of title 18,
United States Code), or to have participated
in the activities of a criminal street gang
knowing or having reason to know that such
activities will promote, further, aid, or sup-
port the illegal activity of the criminal
gang. For purposes of this subparagraph, the
Secretary may consider any and all credible
evidence of membership or participation in a
criminal street gang, including evidence ob-
tained from a State or Federal data base
used for the purpose of recording and sharing
activities of alleged gang members across
law enforcement agencies.
Page 12, strike line 21 and all that follows
through page 13, line 13 (and redesignate suc-
ceeding subparagraphs accordingly).
Add at the end the following (and conform
the table of contents accordingly):
TITLE III—GENERAL PROVISIONS
SEC. 301. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN ALIENS
FOUND INELIGIBLE FOR ADJUST-
MENT OF STATUS.
Notwithstanding sections 111(e), 129,
211(c)(3), and 229 of this Act, an alien whose
application would be denied based on crimi-
nal, national security, gang, or public safety
grounds, as set out in section 111(c) or
211(a)(3) of this Act, shall be referred by the
Secretary of Homeland Security for a deter-
mination of whether the alien should be
placed in removal proceedings under section
240 of the Immigration and Nationality Act
(8 U.S.C. 1229a).
Mr. CLINE (during the reading). Mr.
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that
the reading be dispensed with.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia?
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes in
support of his motion.
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, this amend-
ment will not kill the bill or send it
back to committee. If adopted, the bill
will immediately proceed to final pas-
sage, as amended.
Mr. Speaker, the American people
are sympathetic, forgiving, and reason-
able people. They understand the idea
of providing some type of certainty and
stability for the approximately 700,000
DACA-eligible recipients who were
brought to the United States by their
parents at a young age and who other-
wise have played by the rules while
growing up in this country.
Mr. Speaker, what they don’t under-
stand is providing green cards and a
path to citizenship for violent gang
members, national security threats,
and those who, through their disdain
for our laws, thumb their noses at Lady
Liberty and the Constitution of the
United States.
They definitely don’t understand why
this bill treats men and women at the
Department of Homeland Security like
they are the dangerous ones, pre-
venting them from receiving and uti-
lizing readily available information in
order to remove gang members, na-
tional security threats, and other pub-
lic safety threats from our country to
keep our families, our communities,
and our Nation safe.
This motion to recommit simply says
that if an alien has been designated a
danger to Americans, then they don’t
deserve to become an American.
It provides that aliens whose applica-
tions are denied on the basis of crimi-
nal activity, national security risks, or
as violent gang members are automati-
cally referred to the Department of
Homeland Security for a determination
of removability from the United
States.
Under this bill, information about
criminal activity provided in an appli-
cation for a green card may not be used
for the purpose of immigration enforce-
ment, even if the application is denied
or withdrawn.
In practice, this means that, if an ap-
plicant has a murder conviction or if
the applicant is a gang member and
DHS knows about it because of the ap-
plication, they can’t refer that person
for removal. It is just wrong.
The perverse and practical effect of
H.R. 6 is that criminal aliens, gang
members, terrorist threats, and other
public safety threats who could be de-
nied a green card will simply stay in
this country, as if we are simply a
sanctuary nation.
Mr. Speaker, some cities might want
to be sanctuary cities, but most Ameri-
cans want safety from crime, not sanc-
tuary for criminals.
This MTR also does not affect the
stay of removal provisions in H.R. 6 or
the provisions relating to finality of
adjudication in the bill. Thus, the alien
cannot be removed until they have ex-
hausted their appeals and received a
final decision on their application.
If Democrats see fit to exclude crimi-
nals, national security risks, public

June 4, 2019
safety risks, and gang members from
receiving green cards, then they should
vote for this motion to recommit to en-
sure those dangerous aliens are also de-
nied a safe haven in the United States.
I am sure most of the individuals who
will take advantage of the provisions
in this bill respect the U.S. Constitu-
tion and obey the laws of this Nation,
but history has proven that criminal
aliens, gang members, terrorists, and
other public safety threats apply for
immigration benefits all the time. If
they didn’t, we wouldn’t have to have
section 212 of the Immigration and Na-
tionality Act, which makes such aliens
inadmissible.
Even under DACA, under President
Obama’s program, criminals have ap-
plied. In fact, according to U.S. Citi-
zenship and Immigration Services, al-
most 8 percent of total DACA request-
ers, 59,786 individuals, had arrest
records, which included such offenses
as assault and battery, rape, murder,
and drunk driving. And 199 individuals
who requested DACA had 10 or more ar-
rests.
H.R. 6 also provides green cards to
gang members. Criminal gangs are a
scourge on our communities, preying
on vulnerable populations while com-
mitting a vast array of criminal acts.
H.R. 6 should not give gang members
a foothold in the U.S. by fast-tracking
them to a green card.
This MTR makes it easier for DHS to
deny the applications of gang members
by making it an eligibility require-
ment that an alien is not a gang mem-
ber and by explicitly permitting DHS
to take into account the information
found in gang databases.
Hear me clearly: No matter what
Democratic colleagues may say in the
next few minutes, if Members don’t
vote for this MTR, they cannot look
their constituents in the eye and hon-
estly say that criminals will not get
green cards.
If the Democrats want to prevent
such dangerous individuals from get-
ting green cards, they must vote for
this MTR. To do otherwise is to pre-
vent a commonsense change that will
ensure the safety of law-abiding Ameri-
cans, as well as those who are seeking
to be part of the greatest nation on
Earth, the United States of America.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to
oppose the motion to recommit.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Colorado is recognized for
5 minutes.
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I may be
new to Washington, but, apparently, I
have learned something that the other
side of the aisle has not, which is how
to read a bill. If my colleagues go to
page 11, line 21, of this bill, they will
learn that gang members are not eligi-
ble under H.R. 6.
Mr. Speaker, if my colleagues don’t
believe me, I will quote the bill, that
the applicant ‘‘knowingly, willingly,
and willfully participated in offenses
committed by a criminal street gang
. . . with the intent to promote or fur-
ther the commission of such offenses’’
may be denied by the Secretary of
Homeland Security.
So, look, spare me. Spare me, Mr.
Speaker.
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
Chair will remind all persons in the
gallery that they are here as guests of
the House and that any manifestation
of approval or disapproval of pro-
ceedings is in violation of the rules of
the House.
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I ask my
colleagues to spare me this false out-
rage because if this really were about
gang violence, my colleagues have con-
tinuously had opportunities to pass
legislation that would curb that
threat.
If this were about gun violence and
gang violence, where were my Repub-
lican colleagues last year when Con-
gressman CONNOLLY introduced H.R.
5960, a bill actually called the Pre-
venting Gang Violence Act of 2018, a
bill that they killed in committee?
If my colleagues across the aisle
truly wanted to combat gang violence,
why did they refuse to let H.R. 1297, the
Youth PROMISE Act, come out of com-
mittee when it was introduced in the
114th Congress by Congressman SCOTT?
At the end of the day, there is no
question that no one is interested in al-
lowing gang members to benefit from
the American Dream and Promise Act,
and that is why this bill addresses this
exact issue.
At the end of the day, the Secretary
has the ability to deny any applicant if
they have directly participated in gang
activity, even if they have not been
convicted of a crime.
Mr. Speaker, what we have lost in
the debate today, in my view, is what
this bill is all about at its core.
I rise today not just as a Member of
this body, not just as a proud Amer-
ican, but as the son of immigrants, as
the son of African refugees who came
to the United States over 35 years ago
from a war-torn country in east Africa.
They became naturalized citizens,
and they never forgot nor took for
granted the freedom and the opportuni-
ties that the United States of America
gave them and their children.
That I am able to stand in this
Chamber with all of my colleagues
today is proof that the American
Dream is real, and I want it to be at-
tainable for generations to come.
That is why we must pass H.R. 6
today. Right now, there are young peo-
ple all across our country who know no
other home but the United States.
These kids are dedicated and willing to
put in the hard work to earn a college
education. They are excelling in their
careers. They are contributing to our
communities in countless ways every
day.
We cannot allow these young people
to continue to live in fear, to be at risk
every single day of being ripped away
from their lives and losing everything
that they know.
In America, immigrants are integral
parts of each of our communities and
of our economy. They are our friends.
They are our neighbors. They are our
coworkers. They are fighting each and
every day, just as we are, to live up to
the American ideals that our country
was founded on.
Mr. Speaker, I have often heard my
colleagues on the other side of the aisle
offer quotes in this Chamber, in my
limited time here. Well, let me give
you a quote.
b 1830
Mr. Speaker, I would like to offer a
quote, and the quote is as follows: ‘‘It
is bold men and women, yearning for
freedom and opportunity, who leave
their homelands and come to a new
country to start their lives over. They
believe in the American Dream. And
over and over, they make it come true
for themselves, for their children, and
for others. They give more than they
receive. They labor and succeed. And
often they are entrepreneurs. But their
greatest contribution is more than eco-
nomic, because they understand in a
special way how glorious it is to be an
American.’’
That quote, those are not my words.
Those are the words of President Ron-
ald Reagan, and they were delivered by
President Ronald Reagan in 1980, the
same year my parents came to the
United States.
Let’s pass H.R. 6 today, and let’s
treat every person in our country who
has struggled and is just as American
as you and I are, let’s treat them with
the respect that they deserve.
Vote ‘‘no’’ on this motion to recom-
mit, and let’s pass H.R. 6 today.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit.
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion to recommit.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the noes appeared to have it.
RECORDED VOTE
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I demand a
recorded vote.
A recorded vote was ordered.

ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair

The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts?
There was no objection.
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows:
H. RES. 413
Whereas June 6, 2019, marks the 75th anni-
versary of the day the United States
launched the assault at Normandy, France,
alongside troops of the United Kingdom,
Canada, and Free France, known as ‘‘Oper-
ation Overlord’’;
Whereas the D-Day landing was the largest
single amphibious assault in history;
Whereas an attack by Nazi E-boats during
a series of large-scale rehearsals conducted
in preparation for D-Day, known as Exercise
Tiger, resulted in at least 749 American serv-
icemen deaths;
Whereas soldiers of 6 divisions, including 3
from the United States, 2 from the United
Kingdom with troops from Free France, and
1 from Canada, stormed ashore in 5 main
landing areas on beaches in Normandy, code-
named ‘‘Utah’’, ‘‘Omaha’’, ‘‘Gold’’, ‘‘Juno’’,
and ‘‘Sword’’;
Whereas approximately 10,000 Allied cas-
ualties were incurred on the first day of the
landing, with more than 6,000 being members
of the United States Armed Forces;
Whereas over the course of Operation Over-
lord, the Allies managed to land more than
2,000,000 men in Northern France and suf-
fered nearly 230,000 casualties;
Whereas military and civilians on the
home front and abroad made significant con-
tributions and sacrifices toward the success
of Operation Overlord, including more than
19,000 French civilian casualties during the
Normandy campaign;
Whereas the Allied assault and following
operations were supported by ships, aircraft,
and troops from Australia, Belgium, Czecho-
slovakia, Free Norway, Greece, the Nether-
lands, New Zealand, and the Polish Armed
Forces in the West;
Whereas the arrival of United States forces
in Europe and the ultimate success of the
Normandy campaign, albeit at tremendous
cost, ultimately turned the tide for the Al-
lies and led to victory over Adolf Hitler, the
Nazi regime, and of one of the most evil
ideologies the world has ever seen;
Whereas the Normandy American Ceme-
tery and Memorial in Normandy, France, is
the final resting place for more than 9,000
Americans who gave their lives to the cause
of liberating Europe from Nazi tyranny;
Whereas the advanced age of the last re-
maining veterans of World War II and the
Normandy landings, and the gradual dis-
appearance of any living memory of the
events, make it necessary to increase edu-
cational activities intended to impart these
critical moments in history, particularly to
younger generations;
Whereas the significant material remains
of the Normandy landings found on the Nor-
mandy beaches and at the bottom of the sea
in the territorial waters of France, such as
shipwrecks and various items of military
equipment, bear witness to the remarkable
and unique nature of the material resources
used by the Allied forces to execute the Nor-
mandy landings;
Whereas the 5 Normandy beaches and a
number of sites on the Normandy coast, in-
cluding Pointe du Hoc and various para-
trooper drop zones, were the scene of the D-
Day landings and constitute a unique piece
of world heritage and a symbol of peace and
freedom; and
Whereas the world owes a debt of gratitude
to the members of the ‘‘Greatest Genera-
tion’’, who assumed the task of freeing the
world from Nazi and Fascist regimes and re-
storing liberty in Europe: Now, therefore, be
it
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives—
(1) recognizes the 75th anniversary of the
amphibious landing by the Allies on June 6,
1944, at Normandy, France and this seminal
moment in American history that has
shaped security and prosperity;
(2) recognizes this decisive point in history
that led to world leadership which now rests
upon the shoulders of a free people, com-
mitted to modern liberal democracy, and all
its tenets;
(3) recognizes the importance of World War
II history and D-Day as symbols of the costs
of freedom, the perils of fascism, and the in-
dispensable nature of the global alliances
and partnerships of the United States,
through which the United States and its al-
lies together stand ready to defeat any foe;

(4) expresses gratitude and appreciation to
the members of the United States Armed
Forces and allied armed forces who partici-
pated in the D-Day operations, and other
military and nonmilitary personnel, at home
and abroad, who contributed to the success
of Operation Overlord and turned the tide of
war against the Nazis and the Axis Powers
during World War II;
(5) expresses gratitude and appreciation to
the young people of the United States,
France, the United Kingdom, Canada, and all
our allies for their efforts to celebrate the
75th anniversary of the Normandy landings,
preserve the historical significance of D-Day,
and ensure that future generations know of
the acts of heroism and sacrifice carried out
by Allied troops who gave their lives in the
name of freedom;
(6) calls for expanding educational efforts
to ensure that the lessons of World War II
and the sacrifices made in pursuit of freedom
are never forgotten;
(7) recognizes the efforts of France and the
people of Normandy to preserve for future
generations the unique world heritage rep-
resented by the Normandy beaches and off-
shore sunken ship remains by inscribing
those beaches and remains on the United Na-
tions Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage List;
(8) requests that the President issue a
proclamation recognizing the remaining liv-
ing veterans of the Normandy campaign; and
(9) calls on the people of the United States
to observe the 75th anniversary of the Nor-
mandy landings with appropriate ceremonies

by those who liberated Europe.
The resolution was agreed to.
A motion to reconsider was laid on

MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING
VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE IN
VIRGINIA BEACH, VIRGINIA
(Mrs. LURIA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to remember and honor the 12
wonderful people whose lives ended far
too soon in Friday’s mass shooting in
Virginia Beach.
Our city, our Commonwealth, and
our Nation grieve.
Now is the time for healing, coming
together, and determining ways to pre-
vent this kind of tragedy from ever
happening again.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my House col-
leagues to please join me in a moment
of silence for those who lost their lives.
f
EID AL-FITR
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to celebrate the Islamic holy
month of Ramadan and the holiday of
Eid al-Fitr.
For the past month, Muslims in the
United States and around the world
have heightened their spiritual aware-
ness through self-restraint, reflection,
and fasting.
Sundown today marks the end of Eid
al-Fitr, or the festival of breaking the
fast. Eid is a major holiday filled with
celebration and festivities for Muslims.
I am honored to represent a reli-
giously diverse district. New Jersey’s
10th Congressional District is a re-
markable and vibrant community
filled with people of all faiths.
Across the country, we have seen the
rising tide of discrimination and hate
aimed at religious minorities. Just last
month, during the middle of Ramadan,
an arsonist burned down a mosque in
Connecticut. But hate will not break
the American spirit.
We are made stronger as a people be-
cause we are free to live and worship
openly.
So on this holy day of Eid, let us
come together as a Nation and cele-
brate our diversity.
Eid Mubarak.

HONORING THE LIFE OF CHIEF
COLABE, III
(Mr. BABIN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
to honor the life of Mikko Colabe, III,
or Clem Fain Sylestine, as he was also
known, the principal chief of the Ala-
bama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas, who
passed away on May 21, 2019, at the age
of 91 years.
Chief Colabe, III, was born on Novem-
ber 4, 1927, on the Alabama-Coushatta
Indian Reservation and is of the Grand-
daddy Long Legs Clan.
He received a Bachelor of Arts degree
from Austin College in Sherman,
Texas, in 1952.
Chief Colabe, III, was a teacher and
coach at Southmayd High School, Hol-
land High School, Shepherd High
School, Woodville ISD, and Goodrich
ISD. Although he retired in 1988, Chief
Colabe, III, touched so many lives
throughout his time in education.
In addition to the passion that he had
for educating children, Chief Colabe,
III, was a distinguished Tribal leader
for most of his adult life. He served as
an elected Tribal Council member and
then served as its chairman for many
years.
He assumed his chieftainship role in
1995 as the second chief and was elected
as the principal chief in 2014. In serving
as the principal chief, he followed in
the footsteps of his father, Bronson
Cooper Sylestine, who served as the
chief from 1936 to 1969.
Chief Colabe, III, was a direct de-
scendant of Chief Colabe, who served as
the second chief to Principal Chief
Antone in the early 1800s. He was also
an elder in the Indian Village Pres-
byterian Church on the Alabama-
Coushatta Indian Reservation.
As I join the Tribe in their period of
mourning through the end of 2019, I
want to recognize the impact that he
had on so many east Texas commu-
nities.
The Alabama-Coushatta Tribe is an
integral part of east Texas.
Mr. Speaker, my prayers and condo-
lences are with his family, his friends,
and the Tribe of Chief Colabe, III.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO LEGACY OF
LEAH CHASE
(Mr. RICHMOND asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, it is
with a heavy heart that I rise today to
pay tribute to the life and legacy of
one Mrs. Leah Chase, a world-famous
chef and businesswoman in New Orle-
ans who is known around the world as
the Queen of Creole Cuisine. She passed
away this past Saturday at the age of
96.
Mrs. Chase was someone who was ad-
mired by all she came in contact with.
Her restaurant was the nerve center of
the New Orleans civil rights move-
ment. Civil rights leaders and activists
used Dooky Chase Restaurant to meet,
strategize, and organize. She fed lead-
ers from the Freedom Riders to Dr.
Martin Luther King to celebrities like
Nat King Cole, and including Presi-
dents of the United States, both George
W. Bush and Barack Obama.
Mrs. Chase was a personal friend,
mentor, and inspiration to me. Her
ability to connect with leaders and pa-
trons of all backgrounds, coupled with
her passion of people and culinary arts,
makes her legacy forever imprinted in
American and New Orleans history and
culture.
Mr. Speaker, my condolences go out
to the family of Mrs. Chase, and in rec-
ognition of her and her late husband,
Mr. Dooky Chase, for all that they did
to make this a more perfect union.
f
CONGRATULATING SERVICE
ACADEMY NOMINEES
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today on behalf of nine young men and
women who have accepted the call to
serve our Nation, beginning with their
nominations to one of our prestigious
U.S. service academies.
Each has excelled academically and
has shown strong leadership through
extracurricular activities. Today, I ap-

f
CONDEMNING U.S. TARIFFS ON
MEXICO
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I
rise today to vigorously condemn the
administration’s threats to impose
damaging tariffs on imports from Mex-
ico. The proposal underlines a serious
misunderstanding of how our economy
benefits from trade with Mexico.
Here are the facts. Mexico is the
United States’ largest trading partner
in the world. In Texas alone, Laredo
and El Paso saw $55.8 billion and $18.6
billion in trade passing through their
borders last year.
Every product from Mexico will be
taxed higher by the White House, forc-
ing us to pay more for household goods
we buy every day. It is not just the av-
ocados we use for guacamole or the
tequilas we use for margaritas, not
that I drink any of them. It will be ev-
erything, autos, computers, and ma-
chine goods.
Some estimate that even a 5 percent
general tariff could eliminate more
than 400,000 U.S. jobs. This would be
catastrophic to my State and other
States on the border.
The White House clearly does not un-
derstand the special economic relation-
ship between Texas and Mexico and has
shown that it is willing to throw away
our economy for bravado and bullying.
f
PROVIDE SOLUTION FOR WASTE
FROM EXPANDING NUCLEAR
POWER PLANTS
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, as a Mem-
ber of the House Energy Action Team,
I am proud to rise here this evening to
shed some light on our theme of the
week, nuclear energy.
Georgia’s 12th District is home to
two nuclear power plants, Plant Vogtle
and Plant Hatch. We are leading the
way in the expansion of our Nation’s
nuclear resources with the first two
nuclear reactors being built in 30 years
currently under construction at Plant
Vogtle.
After visiting Vogtle in March and
witnessing the placement of the top of
the unit 3 containment vessel, I can
tell you that construction is full steam
ahead. I look forward to units 3 and 4
coming online as soon as possible.
However, we currently have thou-
sands of spent fuel rods being held in
spent fuel pools and dry cask storage
containers on these sites and around
the country. We must have a perma-
nent geological site, like Yucca Moun-
tain, to manage our nuclear waste.
I cosponsored the Nuclear Waste Pol-
icy Amendments Act, which provides a
solution to this problem, and I urge
Congress to act upon this bill as soon
as possible.
f
COMMEMORATING 75TH
ANNIVERSARY OF D-DAY
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate the historic
75th anniversary of D-Day, June 6, 1944,
the heroic Allied invasion of Europe at
Normandy, France.
Let us honor the 180,000 Allied troops
who reclaimed liberty for the modern
world, moving across the turbulent
English Channel, which ran red with
their blood, including from our beloved
uncle, Stanley Rogowski.
Our troops endured more deadly Nazi
shelling from land and air as they
clawed their way up the daunting sea-
walls and beaches to retake Europe for
the free world.
The weather was harsh. The shores
were littered with mines and barbed
wire. From their landing crafts and
parachutes, our soldiers were met with
heavy fire.
The work of clearing the five beaches
upon which the Allies landed—Omaha,
Utah, Gold, Juno, and Sword—was as
difficult as it was deadly. It was not
until June 12 that all five beaches,
stretching over 50 miles, were finally
conquered.
When the smoke finally cleared, over
4,000 Allied troops had made the ulti-
mate sacrifice.
Operation Neptune was a decisive
victory for the Allied cause. It remains
the largest seaborne invasion in his-
tory and a turning point in the Second
World War.
Until that day, Adolf Hitler waged
destruction and terror across Europe,
virtually unencumbered on the West-
ern Front. From France to Poland to
Russia, millions died in his wake. But
from the Allied foothold in Normandy,
American, Canadian, and British
troops spread out across Europe and
liberated German-occupied Europe
from Nazi tyranny.
This week, we gratefully remember
and honor the men and women who
served and sacrificed for the freedom of
Europe and the entire world. We live in
their debt each day.

REMEMBERING JERRY WATKINS
DIXON
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember the life of
Mr. Jerry Watkins Dixon, who passed
away on Monday, May 20, at the age of
63.
A lifelong resident of the First Con-
gressional District of Georgia, Mr.
Dixon was born in Waycross before
moving to Blackshear as a small child.
He was constantly serving the public
in Blackshear, always lending a help-
ing hand and trying to make the city a
better place to live. Between the
United Way, Red Cross, Pierce County
Chamber of Commerce, serving on the
city council, and working at the local
radio station, his life touched nearly
every corner of the community.
He not only took great pride in
Blackshear but also his closest friends,
who would say that if you were a friend
of Jerry, you were a friend for life.
Those who knew him best could often
be found enjoying history or music
with Mr. Dixon or listening to him
speaking in his radio voice.
I am proud that Mr. Dixon lived in
the First Congressional District of
Georgia. His family and friends will be
in my thoughts and prayers during this
most difficult time.

CONGRATULATING CUMBERLAND
COUNTY COLLEGE ON NATIONAL
BASEBALL CHAMPIONSHIP
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, last
Wednesday, the south Jersey Cum-
berland County College baseball team
beat their rivals 11–7, winning the Na-
tional Junior College Athletic Associa-
tion Division 3 World Series champion-
ship. This achievement is the first na-
tional championship win in any sport
in Cumberland County in south Jersey.
The team’s coach, Keith Gorman, at-
tributed their success to their impres-
sive pitching staff and tough defense.
He also pointed to the importance of
their values. Not only does the Cum-
berland County baseball team value
toughness, but they also focus on self-
lessness. The diversity of Cumberland
County has been represented in their
team and has contributed to their suc-
cess.
Baseball is incredibly important to
the community of Cumberland County,
and its college team reflects the values
that the south Jersey community
holds: selflessness and togetherness.
I am very proud of the hard work of
these young men and wish them luck
in the future.

HONORING SACRIFICES OF THE

Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, this
Thursday, June 6, will mark the 75th
anniversary of D-Day, and I rise today
to honor the sacrifices and efforts of
those brave soldiers.
It is critical for us always to remem-

in the words of General Dwight D. Ei-
senhower, brought about ‘‘the elimi-
nation of Nazi tyranny over the op-
pressed peoples of Europe and security
for ourselves in a free world.’’
Mr. Speaker, over 160,000 soldiers,
sailors, and airmen participated in the
invasion, which would precede the long
and difficult battle across Europe, end-
ing in the full victory that Eisenhower
asked of his men on June 6, 1944.
Of the many brave soldiers from
Pennsylvania’s 11th District, perhaps
none is better known than Major Dick
Winters, who was born in Lancaster
County and attended Franklin & Mar-
shall College. Dick offered the world
his memories and the memories of his
fellow soldiers in the book and later
HBO miniseries ‘‘Band of Brothers.’’
One day, Dick Winters was asked by
his grandson, ‘‘Grandpa, were you a
hero in the war?’’ He said to him, ‘‘No,
I’m not a hero, but I have served in a
company full of them.’’
Mr. Speaker, we offer thanks and
unending gratitude for the heroes who
have served.

COMMENDING IMMIGRATION AC-
TIVISTS AND GRASSROOTS OR-
GANIZERS
(Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker,
today is a profoundly important day. It
is the day that we passed the American
Dream and Promise Act.
So many have fought for so long to
reform America’s immigration system,
and I commend the activists and grass-
roots organizers who made this happen,
the families and young people who
shared their stories to press this mo-
ment into fruition.
I also want to highlight the tactics
that are used to ensure that we do not
pursue immigration reform. Labeling
communities as gang members, crimi-
nals, drug dealers, and bad parents, we
have seen this playbook before. It was
the playbook that was used to pass the
1994 crime bill, mass incarceration, the
War on Drugs, to target a community,
to make sure to dehumanize them into
increased enforcement.
We have to make sure that we recog-
nize immigrants as among the greatest
potential of innovation and profound
sources of potential in our country.

MEDICARE FOR ALL WILL LEAD
TO RATIONED HEALTHCARE
(Mr. OLSON asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, a disaster
is brewing in the people’s House. It is
called H.R. 1384, the Medicare for All
Act of 2019.
May 29, 1 week ago from today, the
Fort Bend Chamber had a state of
healthcare event. During Q&A, Dr.
Richard Ehlers, the head of the MD An-
derson Cancer Center, was asked about
Medicare for All: ‘‘Medicare for All is
the most expensive way to go, and it
would be the most expensive system to
utilize. The underlying model for the
rest of the world is actually not uni-
versal healthcare but rationed medical
care.’’
He continued, ‘‘Depending on the
supply and the patient’s age, it could
mean a 72-year-old man who needs a
liver transplant is told he is not eligi-
ble because of his age.’’
That man, 72 years old, is given a
death sentence by Medicare for All, and
that is just the way it is.

CRISIS AT THE BORDER
(Mr. CLOUD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, this last
week, I once again got the opportunity
to visit the Texas-Mexico border for an
updated look at the situation, and I
can confirm that this is certainly not a
manufactured crisis. Our border re-
sources are completely overwhelmed.
For those of us from Texas, we have
understood the situation for quite
some time, and what we saw was an
overworked, vastly underfunded Border
Patrol trying to deal with an over-
whelming flood of migrants and dan-
gerous criminal cartels.
Cartels smuggler fees for illicit activ-
ity in the Rio Grande Valley Sector are
estimated to be about $80 million each
week. Our Border Patrol’s budget in
that sector is around $30 million per
year. There is no way for our good men
and women in the border services to
compete with this kind of mismatch.
The situation is unsustainable. The
phrase we heard repeatedly from Bor-
der Patrol agents is: ‘‘There is no end
in sight.’’ And, indeed, the numbers
that we expect to be released soon will
probably show over 130,000 migrants
have crossed just in May.
What is already a crisis will only get
worse unless we act. This is, indeed, a
very real crisis, a humanitarian crisis,
a criminal crisis, and a national secu-
rity crisis. This needs our attention
now.

75TH ANNIVERSARY OF D-DAY
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, 75 years
ago, in a letter to his troops, General
Dwight D. Eisenhower encouraged the
invasion forces of D-Day.
‘‘The eyes of the world are upon
you,’’ he wrote. ‘‘The hope and prayers
of liberty-loving people everywhere
march with you.’’ He ended this famous
letter with a call to pray: ‘‘Let us all
beseech the blessings of Almighty God
upon this great and noble under-
taking.’’
On the 75th anniversary of D-Day, we
turn our attention and admiration to
those young soldiers at sea, in the air,
and on land who sought to liberate Eu-
rope from tyranny.
This is the time to humbly remember
the sacrifice of over 4,000 American sol-
diers who died on the beaches of Nor-
mandy to liberate the world from evil;
and it is a time to thank Almighty God
for his blessings in delivering some of
the heroes of D-Day home after the war
and for welcoming those who did not
into his heavenly kingdom.

CONSTRUCTION ON NEW REDDING
VA OUTPATIENT CLINIC BEGINS
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, last
week I had the incredible privilege to
participate in the groundbreaking for
the new Redding VA Outpatient Clinic.
This will serve veterans all over
northern California with the increased
size and space as well as the increased
capabilities of the new clinic, which in-
clude allergy, immunology,
rheumatology, and additional tele-
medicine rooms being available. Also,
increased radiology service will include
fluoroscopy capabilities. This is a good
sign for being able to better care for
our veterans in northern California.
I would also like to point out one of
the driving forces in seeing this clinic
happen in the Redding area, and that
would be our former State Senator
Maurice Johannessen. This has been
his vision and his dream for a long
time: to help our veterans in northern
California.
So my hat is off in appreciation to
my friend Maurice, and we will attend,
together, the ribbon-cutting before too
much longer.
So, indeed, congratulations for the
good work to VA and Senator
Johannessen and everybody else who
had a hand in it.

HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES OF CHINA
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Flor-

utes as the designee of the minority

Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate
the opportunity to speak before the

Special Order on the human rights
abuses of China.
Being the 30-year anniversary of
Tiananmen Square, where hundreds, if
not thousands, of people were murdered
at the hands of the Chinese Communist
Party, I think it is due that we give re-
spect to the people.
What I have here is a poster of people
in China in 1989 who came to
Tiananmen Square. These were the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4299
June 4, 2019
people who were peaceful. They were
wanting a democracy. They were want-
ing the things that we yearn for that
are innate in all people.
And we are blessed in this Nation to
be born in a country where the found-
ing principles said that our rights come
from our creator, not from govern-
ment, and government is instituted by
‘‘we the people.’’
We give our consent to be governed,
the very first nation on the planet to
ever do that. And so that word had
spread around the world, obviously.
China, being somewhat of a hermit
nation from the Opium Wars of the
1840s into the early 1900s, wasn’t intro-
duced to the modern world. But with
the advent of publications and with
other things, they became aware of
what freedom was. And freedom, as we
know it in this country, is something
that we fought for.
The freedom and liberty that we have
today is something that is innate in all
humans on the planet, regardless of
what government form they have. The
ability to be free thinking, to want
freedom, to want liberty, is something
that comes with us when we are born,
when we are created in the womb.
It is no different than, I guess, an oak
tree. If an acorn is put in the ground, it
doesn’t know it is an oak tree, but it
goes straight up into the sky. The
roots grow down. That is an innate
quality that has been designed geneti-
cally in that.
Humans are the same way, so they
have a desire to be free thinking and
free determining. The thing that is for-
tunate for us is that we have a govern-
ment that got formed.
And so the people in Tiananmen
Square, June 4, 1989, wanted this very
same freedom, but, unfortunately, the
Government of China thought dif-
ferently.
June 4 marks the 30th anniversary of
the Tiananmen Square massacre, when
the Chinese Government forcibly sup-
pressed the peaceful pro-democracy
protest—and I want to repeat that, a
peaceful pro-democracy protest—and
declared martial law, killing hundreds,
maybe thousands, of innocent Chinese
citizens. Troops with assault rifles and
tanks fired upon the protests, creating
utter and despicable chaos.
Thirty years later, the Chinese Com-
munist Party continues to censor all
information relating to this attempt,
attempting to completely erase it from
history. So, for the new generations of
Chinese, they don’t know if this hap-
pened or not because they can’t look
outside of China.
The Chinese Communist Party has
such control over the people of China
that it is forbidden to look at pictures.
They are taken off of the internet.
They are not in the history books.
They are not in the school books that
talk about Tiananmen Square, that
talk about the pro-democracy move-
ment that people yearn and desire for.
The human rights abuses under the
Chinese Communist Party have contin-
ued. But if we look back at China—and
I want to direct this conversation, not
to the Chinese people, because they are
like people everywhere else in the
world.
I chaired the Asia-Pacific Sub-
committee in the last Congress. I am
the ranking member this Congress. I
have had the opportunity to travel
around the world, and when I talk to
people around the world, we will ask
them the same question: Do people in
your country have the desire to be free
and self-determining?
Every one of them says that, and
they say: I want a better future for our
children than I had.
And, again, that is why I feel this is
an innate thing that we are born with,
and I know that.
So, as we travel around, we see this
as not true in China. And so the Chi-
nese people are great; it is the Chinese
Communist Party under the control of
Xi Jinping.
China has an amazing history that
spans thousands of years. Its culture
has stayed, for the most part, intact
since the 19th century.
There have been multiple rulers and
emperors recorded in the history
books. In fact, at one point, China and
most of Eurasia were under the control
of Ghengis Khan and the Mongolian
Empire. This empire was larger than
the Roman Empire.
Khan allowed the people in his em-
pire to be free and prosper through
their work and developed a market
economy based on production and
trade. He provided protection from in-
vasion, and they provided goods, serv-
ices, and loyalty to the Khan empire.
This is the way history has been re-
peated over and over again. Since then,
that is when China became the Silk
Road. They were a major economic
powerhouse around the world. They are
great traders in spice and garments
and linens and silks around the world.
But China went from a major eco-
nomic power in the 18th century to a
nation addicted to opium. During the
19th century, China’s ruling class al-
lowed their country to be taken over
by the European colonial and Japanese
imperial powers.
During this time, over 90 percent of
the male population became addicted
to opium. The culture, heritage, and
social fabric of China decayed, and
China truly did enter into a peasant
state, isolated from the world, for the
most part, during the next 70 years.
They were a lost country. This has be-
come known as the century of shame.
The PLA, the People’s Liberation
Army, emerged in 1927. In fact, they
will have a 100-year anniversary in
2027.
Mao Zedong was a favored member of
the PLA, and he later became the
Chairman of the Communist Party of
China. He promised communism would
be the savior of China.
Mao was an ardent student of Karl
Marx and Friedrich Engels, the father
of communism, where an individual’s
role in society was to serve the party
for the greater good of the whole. His
policies were one where the Communist
Party was the supreme law of the land.
Mao, being a firm believer in this
philosophy, implemented top-down
policies in all sectors of China’s econ-
omy and culture, destroying the great-
ness that China once had. His farming
policies led to a famine and starvation.
Seventy to eighty million people died
under Mao’s policy due to a combina-
tion of starvation and a purge of those
who dared to show political dissent to-
wards the communist ruling party.
Mao set a 100-year plan for China to
regain its lost stature. Maoism became
a belief and a philosophy for many. It
was even idolized in some think tanks,
with prominent individuals claiming
this was a better way to govern a coun-
try, a country where the individual
needs are secondary to the needs of the
Communist Party, where individuals
can’t challenge the government, the
party, or its ideology.
And, again, I am so thankful that we
are born in our country, as messy as
democracy is. As Ben Franklin fore-
warned us back when they came out of
the Constitutional Convention in Penn-
sylvania, when asked by a lady, ‘‘What
form of government did you give us,
sir?’’ he said, ‘‘A republic, ma’am, if
you can keep it.’’
We know democracies like we have in
a constitutional republic are messy,
but, by God, they are worth it because
they empower the people.
b 1930
It seems bizarre to me that some
would idolize Maoism, knowing that
history records that 70-plus million
people have been killed through the
failed policies of communism, again,
from the starvation, but also from the
brutal torture and the murder of those
who challenge the Communist Party
and its ideology. That is what I would
like to focus on tonight, the human
rights abuses of the Chinese Party and
the PLA.
Since its founding almost 100 years
ago, it has a record of human rights
abuses that has led to the death of tens
of millions of people, if not over 100
million people.
It does this through the elimination
of anyone that challenges the doctrine
of the Communist Party. I think that
can be seen right here. This shows a
peaceful prodemocracy protest that oc-
curred June 4, 1989, in Tiananmen
Square in China. This is how it started.
This shows the statue of democracy
that these people wanted because they
saw what free people could do in a free
society that had a government that
they could address their grievances to,
to change government to fulfill the
needs of society, not government
changing people to fulfill the needs of
government.
This is how it started, and I think we
have all seen this. Any of us of a little
age or long in the tooth, this is what
we remember, as the videos showed on

our television sets, the horror of people
brave enough to stand in the way of the
tanks.
The Chinese Communist Party and
its ruler, Deng Xiaoping, ordered the
tanks to disperse the protesters. So
they literally killed people. There are
videos of people being run over by
tanks, people are running away. Tanks
are chasing them down and running
them over from the back. And they
killed them over and over again.
This is something that China had
done then, and they are doing it today.
We made a big blunder in our foreign
affairs policies back in the 1970s under
President Richard Nixon and Henry
Kissinger by inviting China into the
modern world. It wasn’t the wrong
thing to invite them into the modern
world, but with no safeguards or direc-
tion, their goal was that they felt that
if China became successful and devel-
oped a strong economic base, they, too,
would become free thinking and would
incorporate into the modern world.
But, unfortunately, as history has re-
corded, China became more totali-
tarian, more authoritarian, and the
Communist Party grew in strength.
China, over the last 30 years, we have
seen go from a backward state to a
very prosperous state, to where 12 per-
cent of the billionaires are now resi-
dents of China or of Chinese origin.
They should be commended for that
type of success, but not at the cost of
what the Chinese Communist Party
has done to their citizens.
Under the Chinese Communist Party
since the founding of the CCP in 1921,
the Communist Party repeatedly dis-
regarded the human rights of the Chi-
nese people. Abuses include the prac-
tice of incommunicado detention, tor-
ture of persons in custody, censorship
of the internet today, and restrictions
on the freedoms of religion, associa-
tion, and assembly.
Xi Jinping, the ruler for life in China
now, has further implemented a
clampdown on political dissent, civil
society, human rights activists, and
lawyers.
The Great Leap Forward, which was
an economic and social campaign led
by the CCP under Mao Zedong from
1949 to 1976, when he died, through the
idea of collectivism—again, right out
of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels’
handbook on communism—the CCP
took control of citizens’ workplaces,
took control of their lands and re-
sources, and used coercion, violence,
and murder to control their famished
citizens.
This failed initiative led to the
deaths of over 75 million people, mak-
ing it the largest episode of mass mur-
der ever on the planet. Not only were 2
million to 3 million people starved to
death, people were needlessly tortured
and killed, and I suspect that number
is small.
The Cultural Revolution also
launched by Mao from 1966 to 1976
called on the Chinese youth to purge
impure elements of Chinese society.
That means anybody that dare chal-
lenge the Communist Party’s ideology
would be purged and they had their
own citizens do that to their own citi-
zens.
This escalated when students formed
paramilitary groups called the Red
Guard and attacked and harassed other
Chinese citizens. Violence erupted be-
tween factions of the Red Guard, cre-
ating wide chaos. The CCP views sepa-
ratist sentiments as a threat to inter-
nal order, and ultimately the party’s
control.
Tibet, Taiwan, the Uighur population
in Xinjiang and Hong Kong are all
threatened because the CCP and Xi
Jinping are insecure and paranoid in
their country and in their leaders, be-
cause they fear free-thinking people.
The CCP in China is the highest entity
in that country. It is higher than any
other entity in the universe, including
God.
The Uighurs in the Xinjiang region,
it has been reported up to 1 million
people—I read a report today that said
it could be 3 million Uighurs, which are
the Muslim sect of the Chinese popu-
lation—have been interned. We don’t
know because it is a closed society.
I have met with the Chinese foreign
ministers. They told me this is not
something that is going on, that the
Uighurs have the ability to come and
go at random. Although I talked to a
Uighur today that was in Tiananmen
Square 30 years ago, and he said that is
not the case.
You don’t book a reservation to go
into the internment camp or the reedu-
cate camp. You are ordered, or forced,
or kidnapped and put into that camp.
You walk around with headphones on
your head for 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week, and they are playing the na-
tional anthem. They are playing the
thoughts of Xi Jinping which are now
the standard that all students must lis-
ten to in China, and so they are reedu-
cating these people forcefully. This is
something they do not have the free
will to leave.
In addition, we found a horrific ele-
ment that came out, there are con-
centration camps—they are not con-
centration camps, although they prob-
ably are—but what we are seeing is
there are crematoriums, not just
crematoriums for when people do pass
away, but they are armed
crematoriums. There was an advertise-
ment that people must be physically fit
and able to fend off people.
My question is, if you have got a
peaceful situation where you are reedu-
cating people at their free will, why do
you need armed crematoriums?
Mr. Speaker, I think what we are see-
ing in China is a repeat of what we saw
in Nazi Germany. This is something I
remember Dwight Eisenhower said, as
he went over there to Auschwitz and to
the other camps: ‘‘Never again.’’
It saddens me that I have been in
Congress for 7 years and I watched the
genocide in Africa, in the different
countries, in Darfur, and Somalia. We
said, never again. Yet it happens. In
Syria, over 500,000 people have been
murdered and slaughtered in that civil
war under the hideous rule of Bashar
al-Assad, and we say, never again. Yet
we allow it to happen.
Mr. Speaker, it is happening right
now. And China is our number one and
two trading partner in the world, as it
is with many of the countries around
the world. I think that we should
rethink our foreign policy of who we
trade with.
There was a hearing today and we
had several people who were members
of the peaceful protest in Tiananmen
Square. One of the protesters, Dong
Shengkun, was arrested as a political
dissident and he was given a death sen-
tence that got commuted to a life sen-
tence that he got off after 17 years.
His comment was in a periodical yes-
terday and he said that he would prefer
to have his son think he is just a reg-
ular criminal, at least in the current
political climate in China, than be po-
tentially put in danger by learning of
his father’s political past.
His child should be proud of him be-
cause that father’s political past was
fighting for the very things our Found-
ing Fathers fought for: freedom and
liberty. He stated: ‘‘It is for his safe-
ty,’’ his son, ‘‘I worry that I might in-
fluence his thoughts if I started chat-
ting to him about those things.’’
Other former political prisoners have
expressed concerns about talking to
their children about the massacre for
fear of putting them at risk. Fellow
Tiananmen survivor, Fang Zheng, said
that he doesn’t blame Dong and the
other activists who wanted to shield
their children from politics. Fang, who
lost both of his legs in the massacre,
blames the ruling Communist Party.
That is the fear and horror that the re-
gime has brought to everybody.
Three decades after the Chinese Gov-
ernment declared martial law—and I
find this interesting, because this re-
lates to the abuses that we are seeing
and why China can do this—three dec-
ades after the Chinese Government de-
clared martial law and unleashed the
military on unarmed students and
worker protesters, the bloodshed has
been largely erased from the nation’s
collective memory.
Think about that. The Chinese Com-
munist Party has so much power that
they control what is in the textbooks,
and we have seen this revisionist his-
tory over and over again in different
countries around the world.
They tried to do it here in the United
States with, I believe it was the Har-
vard University Press, to get them to
rewrite history books so it wasn’t a
negative slant against China.
I know they have done this in Aus-
tralia and other countries around the
world, and they have done this through
force, coercion, and intimidation to get
other countries to bow down to the ide-
ology and the teachings of Xi Jinping
and the Chinese Communist Party.
So after three decades, they have
erased the nation’s collective memory.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4301
June 4, 2019
The question today was asked: What
percentage of the Chinese people even
know of Tiananmen Square? The an-
swer was shocking because these people
who were there in our hearing today
were the actual freedom fighters for de-
mocracy in China at Tiananmen
Square on June 4, 1989.
Their answer was: Probably not 20
percent of the people in China are even
aware of what happened in Tiananmen
Square. The Communist Party-led ef-
fort has created a generation who are
mostly unaware of the Tiananmen
massacre. Dong said, school textbooks
don’t mention it, and students won’t
find photos or stories of June 4 on Chi-
na’s heavily censored internet.
The story can go on, but I hope it
doesn’t for the sake of humanity. If we
look at the Uighurs, the Muslim popu-
lation in the western province of the
Xinjiang region, like I said, up to 1 mil-
lion, maybe 3 million have been in-
terned. There is no way to know. We
asked the foreign minister when he was
in my office, and he assured us this
wasn’t happening. These were vol-
untary camps. And I said: If you feel
that certain, Mr. Foreign Minister, in-
vite the Western free press in there,
and let them report on that.
He said: No, we are not going to do
that. So in the reeducation labor
camps, there is near totalitarian levels
of surveillance and security measures.
Xinjiang is now a police state where
cultural genocide is occurring.
And, again, I go back to Dwight Ei-
senhower: ‘‘Never again.’’
b 1945
CCP views Islam as a threat to the
atheist state.
Again, keep in mind that the Chinese
Communist Party has stated that the
role of the Chinese citizen is to serve
the Chinese Communist Party and that
the Chinese Communist Party is the
ultimate power in the universe; there
is nothing higher.
If we look at Tibet, Tibet has been a
sovereign nation over the millennia. It
is where the Dalai Lama comes from
and has come from throughout history.
In 1959, there was an armed conflict
between the Tibetan people and the
PLA. Retaliation for such an uprising
involved the killing of 87,000 Tibetans.
During occupation of Tibet there
were tortures, killings, bombardments
of monasteries, and the extermination
of a whole nomad camp. What they
have done is they have gone through
and erased the monasteries and erased
much of the people. They moved in the
ethnic Chinese Hun population to the
point where they have diluted the Ti-
betan population, and all they have to
do is wait out time because the youth
won’t know that.
In Tibetan culture, the Dalai Lama is
not chosen by the people. He is chosen
through their process, and it is through
the birth of the Panchen child. The
Panchen child is the next Dalai Lama
in their culture.
When the Panchen child was discov-
ered, China kidnapped him, and they
said: This is not the Panchen child. We
have the real Panchen child.
So they brought him forth.
I found this to be very hideous and
just offensive. Being a Christian nation
as we are, that would be as if King
Herod went to the manger and took
Jesus Christ, saying that that is not
the Lord and Savior and that you have
got it wrong.
Then they kidnapped him and they
put somebody they want in there. That
is how warped the Chinese Communist
Party’s thinking is.
In 2008, violent protests and riots
erupted through Tibet as they desired
more independence from China. CCP
views this as a threat to their control.
That is why I said that the Chinese
Communist Party and Xi Jinping are
insecure.
We can talk about Tibet; we can talk
about the Uighurs; we can talk about
Hong Kong; and we have to talk about
Taiwan, because human rights abuses
are going on through all of these coun-
tries through coercion, intimidation,
and threats.
Hong Kong was a nation that the
British powers captured in the 1800s
during the Opium Wars, during the pe-
riod of colonization. When that hap-
pened, Hong Kong became a province of
Great Britain.
What happened in 1997 is there was an
agreement between Great Britain and
China that they would give the Hong
Kong territory back to China, but
there was an agreement that, for 50
years, there would be autonomous rule
in Hong Kong and that Hong Kong
could continue as it was.
Well, we are 22 years into that, and
already we have seen the usurpation of
power and the influence of China com-
ing in. In fact, China, right now, is try-
ing hard to get extradition laws so that
they can take executives from any
company. If they feel they have treated
the Chinese Communist Party wrong,
they can extradite them to China, and
my bet is we will never hear from these
people again, Mr. Speaker.
We have seen this happen with book-
sellers, and we have seen this happen
with successful businesspeople who
have started insurance companies in
China, who came to America. All of a
sudden, they have mysteriously dis-
appeared, and they have never shown
up.
So Xi Jinping stated that, as far as
he is concerned, the agreement be-
tween Great Britain and China for the
50-year autonomous rule is no longer
valid and that it needs to be done away
with.
My question is: When we talk about
Taiwan—and I think it was a blunder
of our foreign policy when President
Nixon and Henry Kissinger said that
they would agree to a one-country,
two-party system, which stripped Tai-
wan of its autonomy—if Xi Jinping
sees no need to follow course with the
50-year agreement with Hong Kong,
does that give us cause to forget the
agreement that we had with President
Nixon and with the Chinese rulers back
in the seventies? I say, yes, and I think
it is time that we honor and respect
Taiwan for the country it is.
Today, in China, we have mass sur-
veillance of its citizens. So what we see
are human rights evaporating more so
today than ever before.
China has become a powerhouse eco-
nomically. They are starting to become
a powerhouse militarily. They have
learned to leverage certain things that
hold other nations, including the
United States, in debt to them.
If we just look at one example of
that, that would be the rare earth met-
als. Our F–35 fighter jets, 10 percent of
the weight of those are rare earth met-
als; 90 percent comes directly from
China, and the other 10 percent comes
from countries that get it from China.
China is on a march to take over the
world. Mr. Speaker, you can listen to
Xi Jinping in the 17th Communist
Party Congress in 2017. He said that the
year of China has arrived. No longer
will they be made to swallow their in-
terests around the world. It is time for
China to take the world’s center stage.
Mr. Speaker, there is an old saying
that says, if you want to see one’s past,
look at their present situation; if you
want to see one’s future, look at their
present activities, look at their present
investments, look at their present ac-
tions.
I think the actions speak loud and
clear, because the human rights abuses
that started in the 1920s when 70-plus
million people lost their lives, this is
something that has happened over and
over again.
If we look back then and we look at
modern-day China, it is estimated and
predicted that China is about to com-
plete the installation of 2.7 billion
CCTV cameras around their country.
What they are using this for is facial
recognition tied up with artificial in-
telligence. They have over 25 million
people today whom they monitor 24/7,
around the clock, 365 days a year, and
they are giving people what we call
good citizen scores.
If your good citizen score isn’t high
enough, Mr. Speaker, then you don’t
travel on airplanes and you don’t trav-
el on buses. You don’t travel anywhere.
You have no freedoms because you
have become a threat to the Chinese
Communist Party. That is today.
Xi Jinping and his Communist Party
has offered this to the Russian dic-
tator, Putin, who wants this tech-
nology. He has offered this to the aya-
tollahs of Iran. He has offered this to
any despotic government and country
that wants to control their citizens,
that is afraid of freedom of expression
and freedom of thought.
He has also offered this to Maduro in
Venezuela. This is something that they
are going to use to control people to
suppress freedom, liberty, and free
thought.
Again, I talk about how blessed we
are in this country because we have a
country that empowers the individual.

H4302 June 4, 2019
I know as history looks back at this—
and there may be some rocky roads
ahead, but I know the side that empow-
ers their people and that believes in a
Creator will come out on top of this be-
cause what I know is you can’t sup-
press the innate qualities and genetics
of a plant, of a breed of cattle, or of
any animal, and you can’t suppress
human freedom, thoughts, and the in-
nate quality to be free.
So I feel confident that over time the
Chinese suppression, the Chinese Com-
munist Party will collapse, and this
picture where you see the people get-
ting ready to be run over by the tank
will be replaced by this picture and
this statue being rebuilt, the statue of
the Goddess of Democracy and Free-
dom in Tiananmen Square. The future
will show this as what China is doing
in the future of people protesting
peacefully for the freedoms that they
have.
Mr. Speaker, I just want to end with,
on this day, being the 30th anniversary
of a horrendous chapter of suppression
and murder in human history, that if it
is not for us speaking about this, it
won’t be talked about around the
world. China will do everything they
can to erase this kind of history from
the history books, and it would be a
shame for this to go away.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
f
SOCIAL SECURITY
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GARAMENDI) is recognized
for 60 minutes as the designee of the
majority leader.
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I
want to thank my colleague from Flor-
ida bringing to the floor an extremely
important issue: the way in which
China is removing the civil liberties.
Tonight, I do want to talk about
America and some of the things that
are going on within our own country.
When I do these floor sessions, I al-
ways want to start with some sense of
value and purpose, so I usually begin
with this quote from Franklin Delano
Roosevelt, and I think it pretty much
describes—not pretty much. It defi-
nitely describes how I view my job and
how I view what I would hope would be
the work of the Congress of the United
States.
So here is his quote: ‘‘The test of our
progress is not whether we add more to
the abundance of those who have much;
it is whether we provide enough for
those who have too little.’’
This statement of value really flows
down through much of what we do
here. We make a choice almost every
day in ways that are very direct, for
example, when we talk about Social
Security, or indirect when we talk
about war and peace. In the case of
war, men and women who die are gen-
erally those who have little, not those
who have much.
So I want to keep this in mind, and I
want to talk about several pieces of
legislation that we are working on
right now. I want to talk about seniors.
Now, way back when Franklin Roo-
sevelt established the Social Security
system in the height of the Great De-
pression, Social Security was a pension
system. Over the years, it has become
the foundation for the support of re-
tired men and women.
Over the years, because of the way
Social Security is structured, the infla-
tion set up in Social Security does not
keep pace with the normal expenses
that a senior has, which is really much
different than the general inflation
rate for the Nation.
I have introduced a piece of legisla-
tion, H.R. 1553, known as the Fair
COLA for Seniors Act.
Now, COLA is the cost-of-living ad-
justment. What we want to do is to
make it fair for seniors so that we can
honor the value that Franklin Delano
Roosevelt stated so clearly for those
who have the least, and generally that
is the senior population.
So what we want to do is to adjust
the COLA to reflect the real expenses
that a senior has. They are going to
have far more medical expenses, some
of it covered by Medicare, but a lot of
it not, out-of-pocket costs—we want to
do that—housing and other kinds of
transportation issues and the like.
So this would be an adjustment to
the COLA and provide a modest, very
small, modest increase that, over time,
would generate a substantial improve-
ment for the benefits that seniors re-
ceive from their Social Security bene-
fits.
b 2000
Another group that we ought to be
paying attention to, if we are looking
at what Franklin Delano Roosevelt has
said should be the test of our progress,
is what we are doing for those who
have little.
Focus for a moment on students in
America. Maybe it is a grandchild, a
child, or an adult. If we take a look at
the students in America today, not
those who went to school when I did
decades ago but, rather, students in
school today, they are expected to bor-
row money to pay for their education.
It used to be that higher education
was a public benefit, not a private ben-
efit, a public benefit supported by the
taxpayers of America because the
American public understood that if we
had a well-educated workforce, not
only high school but through the col-
lege years, we would have good, strong
economic growth, and we would all be
much better off.
Those days when education was a
public benefit have long been forgot-
ten. Now it is perceived to be a private
benefit to be paid for by the individual
who is fortunate enough to go on to
college.
They do go, and right now, students
who have gone to college in the past
and students who are still in college
today have accumulated $1.5 trillion of
student loan debt.
Over $875 billion is owed to the Fed-
eral Government through the various
Federal loan programs. And guess
what? The interest rate averages over
41⁄2 percent, 41⁄2 percent at the very
same time that the Federal Govern-
ment is borrowing that money to then
loan to the students.
I looked at it this morning. The 10-
year Treasury rate, which is the bor-
rowing rate for the Federal Govern-
ment, is right around 2 percent. The 30-
year rate is just under 3 percent, if I re-
call correctly, 2.8 percent.
The Federal Government is doing an
arbitrage here. It is borrowing at 2 per-
cent and loaning at 6 percent. We are
making money on the backs of the stu-
dents.
What is the effect of that? The effect
of that is that a student cannot engage
in the normal economic activity of
their parents where they are able to
buy a car, go on vacation, buy a house,
raise a family, begin a family. They are
burdened by student loans.
Here is what we are proposing in H.R.
1899, the Student Loan Refinancing and
Recalculation Act. This would simply
say that the Federal Government will
refinance student loans at a rate that
is about 1 percent above the rate at
which the Federal Government is able
to borrow the money.
Right now, instead of 6 percent on a
10-year loan, it would be 3 percent.
That is a lot of money. That is a lot of
interest. It is not necessary for the
Federal Government to do that. This is
the Student Loan Refinancing and Re-
calculation Act.
Undoubtedly, the parents of the stu-
dents are able to refinance their home,
refinance their mortgage. Who
amongst us who owns a home has not
refinanced that home? Most have as
the interest rates have fallen. As I say,
the interest rates for the Federal Gov-
ernment 10-year loan or 10-year note is
now about 2 percent.
Here we go. We think H.R. 1899 is a
good thing. If we can reduce that inter-
est rate to the students, they will be
able to pay off their loans faster. By
the way, the same policy would apply
to new loans not at 6 percent but at the
going rate for the Federal Government
plus 1 percent.
That is H.R. 1899, which I think fits
very directly with what Franklin Roo-
sevelt said should be our purpose.
We have several other bills that I
have introduced, and I am going to go
through some of them rather quickly
here.
I want to take up another one that
really deals with a very special prob-
lem. I think I have put this board up
before. That is Oroville Dam 3 years
ago. The Oroville Dam is the highest
dam in the United States, over 700 feet.
It rains in California. Sometimes, we
have a drought. Sometimes, we have
rain. Sometimes, when we have rain,
we get too much rain.
This is the spillway at Oroville Dam
that failed. If the rain had continued

for another hour or so, the emergency
spillway on that side was about to be—
in fact, it was overtopped. It was begin-
ning to erode beneath the foundation
for the emergency spillway.
That is a 17-foot high spillway. If
that had gone, if the flood had contin-
ued, if the rain had continued for an-
other hour or 2, that erosion would
have undercut that emergency spill-
way, that wall, sending a 17-foot cas-
cade down into the Feather River.
I represent the downstream of the
Feather River, and I know that as a re-
sult of this, 200,000 people had to evac-
uate in communities downstream, the
communities of Yuba City and
Marysville and other communities in
the area, Live Oak and Gridley—200,000
people.
Where did they go? They went onto a
two-lane road, and the backup was
hours and hours. Had this thing bro-
ken, there is no way that they could
have escaped.
I am going to put up another picture.
This one is more recent. This is last
year, 2018. This is Paradise, California.
At one point, the people there thought
they did live in paradise. Then there
was a fire, and they lived not in para-
dise but in hell. The largest death toll
of any fire in California occurred a
year ago in Paradise, California.
We can see some of the remnants
here. People couldn’t escape. A two-
lane road out of town and traffic jams,
so people had to get out of their cars
and run for their lives. Many couldn’t
run fast enough. Lives were lost.
Here on the East Coast, there are
vulnerable areas, for example, Cape
Cod with one road in, one road out, a
two-lane road.
What we have done here as a result of
these issues, Marysville, Paradise fire,
Yuba City, in my district, the super-
visors in Yuba County and Sutter
County downstream from the Oroville
Dam came to me and said we have to
do something. We have to do something
about the escape routes. We have to
have better escape routes. We have to
have signage. We have to have other
kinds of control. We have to make it so
that people can pull off the road if they
have a flat tire and the like.
At the very same time, my friends
from Massachusetts, my colleagues
here in Congress, Congressman BILL
KEATING and Senator ED MARKEY,
knew that they had the very same
problem in Massachusetts, in Cape Cod.
Last year, we introduced legislation,
and we reintroduced it this year. Here
in the House, we call it H.R. 2838, the
ESCAPE Act, the Enhancing the
Strength and Capacity of America’s
Primary Evacuation Routes Act. This
would give communities across the Na-
tion an opportunity to go to the Fed-
eral Department of Transportation and
put projects before it to receive grant
money to improve escape routes in
their communities.
There are many communities around
America that have one road in, one
road out, two lanes or even fewer than
that. We hope that this ESCAPE Act
becomes part of the transportation in-
frastructure program that is now being
discussed here in the Congress of the
United States—H.R. 2838, the ESCAPE
Act, Enhancing the Strength and Ca-
pacity of America’s Primary Evacu-
ation Routes Act.
We don’t ever want to see this again.
We don’t want people to be trapped. We
want to use the programs that the Fed-
eral Government can make available to
assist communities in improving their
escape routes, their emergency evacu-
ation routes.
There are three different pieces of
legislation that I want to bring to the
attention of the Congress.
I have another one. I am on the
Armed Services Committee. On the
Armed Services Committee, we spend a
lot of time looking at war, the mate-
rials that are needed for war, how the
men and women are going to have the
proper equipment.
One of the things we have noticed
over the years, and one might expect
this—certainly, we should expect it—is
that the men and women of our armed
services are often in harm’s way. Usu-
ally, we think of this about the kinds
of things that occur with IEDs, impro-
vised explosive devices, where some
4,200 Americans were killed in Iraq and
similarly in Afghanistan.
But there is another risk. It is dead-
ly, and it is mostly not known at the
time. What we want to do here, as we
have studied the effects of war on the
veterans who have returned, on the
men and women who are out there, we
have learned that whether they are in
Afghanistan or Iraq or at the various
bases here in the United States, they
are often exposed to chemicals, mold,
and other kinds of things that over
time present themselves in serious
health risks and serious health events.
We know this. Think back to the
Vietnam war and Agent Orange. It
took more than 25 years for the vet-
erans of the Vietnam war to be able to
receive benefits for the injuries that
they sustained because of Agent Or-
ange being used in the Vietnam war.
We don’t want that to happen again,
but we know it did.
We know that in the first Iraq war in
the 1990s, thousands of our soldiers
were exposed to toxic fumes and smoke
as the fires raged in the oil fields. Dur-
ing the period of time of occupation in
Iraq in Iraq I and Iraq II, the military
routinely disposed of chemicals of
other kinds of materials in burn pits.
Soldiers were exposed to those toxic
chemicals.
We call this the OATH Act, and this
is H.R. 2617. It is known as the Service
Member’s Occupational and Environ-
mental Transparency Health Act.
What we want to do is when the men
and women are in the field or on the
bases here in the United States, when
they are exposed to some sort of chem-
ical contaminant, they would have in
their medical records at that time that
they had been exposed. That sometime
in their work, in the tasks they were
carrying out, they were exposed to
these toxic materials in their normal
work, that would go into their medical
records.
As they proceed through their ca-
reers in the military or leave the mili-
tary and move on into the Veterans
Administration, that information fol-
lows along with them so that there is
always that data.
Then someday in the future, when
some occurrence happens, for example,
cancer or some other illness happens
that can be traced back to this expo-
sure that took place years before, they
will be able to receive the benefits and
appropriate treatments without having
to guess what happened. It is there in
their records. It is part of their files.
That will be available for them to be
able to get appropriate medical care at
some point in the future.
That is H.R. 2617. It is called the
OATH Act.
I must say that this particular bill
came from one of the members of the
military who served as my military fel-
low, Stephanie Harley. She is a lieuten-
ant colonel now, and she was an envi-
ronmental engineer.
As she worked with me last year, she
said that there is an ongoing problem,
that they do not have in their records
the exposure that they have had to
some toxic chemical or toxic environ-
ment during their days of service.
She said there ought to be a law, and
I agree. There ought to be a law. This
is what she recommended, and I think
it is going to pass. In fact, I think we
are going to try to put it in this year’s
National Defense Authorization Act.
We have strong support.
We also know that TULSI GABBARD,
one of my colleagues here, has intro-
duced a bill that fits very nicely with
this. It deals specifically with the burn
pits. This particular bill is much broad-
er, and it fits very well with the work
that she is doing on a very similar sub-
ject.
These are just a couple of examples,
and I want to deal with two more, if I
might. It won’t take too long, but I do
want to put this up on the board here.
Back to FDR, what are we doing for
the least of our society? This is a pret-
ty good example of where American
policy has gone wrong.
Last year, I served as the ranking
member of the Coast Guard and Mari-
time Subcommittee. I have done that
for the previous 7 years. We spent a lot
of time worrying and thinking about
the American merchant marine.
These are the ships. The United
States is a maritime state. No other
country in the world has more ocean
frontage than the United States. We
have inland rivers that are extraor-
dinarily important, the Ohio, the Mis-
sissippi, the Missouri, all of those, and
out in California, the Sacramento
River.
What has happened? We used to have
thousands of American flagships on
which Americans would work as the

mariners, the sailors, the captains, the
engineers, and the like.
b 2015
But just take a snapshot. In the
1980s, we had 249 flagged American
ships, built in America, manned and
‘‘womanned’’ by Americans. The mari-
ners were Americans. And here we are
now, this is actually 2016. We are down
to 78 ships.
This is a fundamental national secu-
rity issue. We spend all of our time
thinking about the Army, the Navy,
the Air Force, and we should. However,
if you are going to go to war, you are
going to need ships. And I don’t think
we can call up the Chinese and say:
Hey, can you send us a couple of ships
so that we can send our men and
women off to the Pacific?
It is a national security issue that we
be able to transport our military on
the ocean. More than 90 percent of it
has to go by sea, not in the airplanes.
We have got wonderful, large airplanes,
and they are great, but if you are going
to move a lot of equipment, you are
going to need ships.
So that is the state of it. We think
we can do something about that.
I am going to put up a couple of
other charts here. Let’s do this one.
Next year, 2020, the U.S. is expected
to be the world’s third largest producer
of liquefied natural gas for export. 225
LNG—liquefied natural gas—vessels,
ships are expected to be added to the
world fleet by 2020. But due to the erod-
ed capacity of the American shipyards,
none of these will be built in the
United States.
So it is not just the ability to move
equipment around the world. The same
thing happens with the oil that we will
soon be exporting. The statistics are
almost exactly the same.
It is also about the jobs, the jobs in
the American shipyard, good, well-pay-
ing, middle-class jobs that simply don’t
exist today because we are not building
ships in the American shipyards.
But if you happen to be in the Chi-
nese shipyards, you have got a lot of
work to do. Fifty of the vessels are
going to be built in China. In Korea, 70
percent of these new ships are going to
be built in Korea.
How many in America right now?
Zip, zero, none, nada.
We can change that. We have a piece
of legislation to do that, not yet intro-
duced. It will be introduced in the days
ahead. We call that the Energizing
American Shipbuilding Act.
If we are going to ship energy, export
oil and gas, why don’t we do it on
American-built ships?
Not all of it. We, frankly, don’t have
the capacity to build 200 ships or 250,
300 ships. We just don’t have the capac-
ity.
But what if we started with 5 per-
cent? What if we said that 5 percent of
the export of oil and gas—and America
soon will be the third largest exporter
of natural gas, and we are certainly ex-
porting oil. What if we did that on
American ships?
This legislation, the Energizing
American Shipbuilding Act, which we
are going to introduce in the days
ahead, probably next week or the week
after—we will be introducing it with a
bipartisan group.
Senator WICKER in the Senate carried
this bill last year, as I did here in the
House. We didn’t get it passed. We are
making some progress. We hope to get
it this year.
What does it mean? Well, we can kind
of see what it means up here. It means
that we will be building about 50 ships
over the next 15 years or so, LNG tank-
ers and oil tankers.
What does it mean? It means the
shipyards will be busy. It means the
steel yards or the steel factories in
America will be busy. The manufactur-
ers of pumps and engines and hydraulic
systems and electronic systems will be
busy.
And, by the way, we will rebuild the
American mariner base. Right now,
TRANSCOM, responsible for moving all
of the equipment for the Army, Navy,
Air Force across and around the world,
says that one of the key deficiencies in
American security is we don’t have the
mariners to man the ships that we
don’t have. And the ships are aging out
almost as fast as the mariners are re-
tiring. So we can solve this problem
with the Energizing American Ship-
building Act.
So I draw the attention of my col-
leagues to this legislation. We will
have a number in a couple of weeks.
Senator WICKER will have the bill on
the other side, and we will carry for-
ward and, hopefully, we will have our
shipyards busy. We will have Ameri-
cans working in the shipyards, Ameri-
cans building big engines for these
ships and the other kinds of equipment
that are needed.
At the same time, we will begin to
rebuild the force of men and women
who will be on those ships as they trav-
el around the world carrying a very
strategic national asset.
Speaking of veterans, this is another
piece of legislation that we are work-
ing on, and this one really, really
touches me.
This is a picture that we took 2 years
ago. These three gentlemen were mari-
ners. They were merchant mariners in
World War II. These were the men who
were on the ships that took the sup-
plies to Europe, took the supplies to
the Pacific so that America could fight
in World War II. All three of these gen-
tlemen were over 90 years of age.
It took nearly 40 years before the
Congress of the United States recog-
nized that the mariners, the merchant
mariners, were part of our military
program. More than 40 years, they were
on the outside. They were never, ever
recognized as veterans, even though
the merchant mariners in World War II
had the highest death rate of any other
service.
We know about the bombers that
bombed in Europe. We know that the
casualties were extraordinary. We
know that men and women lost their
lives on ships of the Navy and, of
course, in the battlefield, men in the
Army.
However, those men, just as these in
this picture, had a higher death rate
than any of those in the Army, Air
Force, any of those in the Army serv-
ing wherever it may be, or the Marines
or the Navy.
It took a long, long time for us to
recognize them as veterans and make
veteran services available to them, but
that was done about, I think, 40, 45
years after the war ended.
And here we are. Here we are today,
with just one more way to remember
the extraordinary sacrifice that these
men, most of whom are dead—in fact,
earlier today I put a resolution across
the floor on one of these gentlemen
that died this last week.
So we think they ought to be hon-
ored. We think we ought to honor them
with a Congressional Gold Medal, and
so we are now pursuing that. I think we
are going to get it done. We tried last
year. We came up short. The Senate ad-
journed before they would take it up
last year.
But we are going to give it a shot
this year, and I think we are going to
do it; and I think we need to do it, just
as we needed, some years back, to
make certain that they had veteran
services available to them.
Now we need to honor them one more
time. For those few who are still alive,
for those who have died, their family
should know that the Congress of the
United States recognizes the extraor-
dinary sacrifice that was made by their
colleagues.
So this will be the Congressional
Gold Medal Act, and we will have that
out on the floor this next week, and we
will be pushing it along. We need 290
signatures. Don’t ask me why we need
more than a majority just to present
this. But anyway, those are the rules of
the House, and we will follow the rules.
We are at about 220 people.
So now if you have some friends out
there who you think are here in Con-
gress and not paying attention to the
gold medal for the merchant mariners
of World War II, give them a holler and
tell them to sign on. We will get it
done this year and, hopefully, the Sen-
ate will work with us on it.
A final point, and I will end with this
in just a few moments, but I need a
couple more pictures.
In case you didn’t notice, I love these
pictures. I love to put them up here so
that you are not just listening to me;
you can see some of the things we talk
about.
So here is what I want to talk about:
the U.S. military in the age of climate
change.
I became the chairman of the Readi-
ness Subcommittee of the House
Armed Services Committee, an incred-
ible honor and, actually, a lot of work,
very, very important work. That sub-
committee is responsible for over 1,000
military installations all around the

world, responsible for the feeding and
care of the military personnel—Army,
Navy, Air Force, Marines—their equip-
ment.
The purchases of new equipment is in
another subcommittee, but once that
equipment is purchased, is it ready to
be used? Are the troops ready? Are
they properly trained?
And, as I said, we are responsible for
the installations.
We asked a question when I became
chairman, and the question was this: Is
the Department of Defense ready for
the era of climate change? It turns out
the answer is: Not really.
Out there across America, there are
thousands, tens of thousands of men
and some women who served at Camp
Lejeune, the Marine Corps camp here
on the East Coast, famous. It was hit
by a hurricane last fall. The deluge
went on for hours.
The damage done at Camp Lejeune,
trees falling, flooding occurring, roofs
being blown off, leaking, water dam-
age, hundreds of buildings seriously
damaged and uninhabitable, could not
be used, including the headquarters—
Camp Lejeune.
Next to it, Cherry Point Marine
Corps Air Station, similar damage.
It is estimated that here at Camp
Lejeune and Cherry Point, more than
$3 billion of damage has occurred that
will have to be made up for in the days
and weeks ahead.
Now, you may think that was a
wake-up call. Indeed, it should have
been. However, the wake-up call was
occurring just a few days earlier.
That is a picture of Tyndall Air
Force Base, a key Air Force base on
the west coast of Florida in which our
fighter bombers and fighter jets do
their training, the new F–35, the F–22,
all of them.
This base, it was literally blown off
the map. It is right on the edge of the
Gulf. Hurricane came through—I think
it was a 5 hurricane—and literally blew
this base off the map, obliterated
major parts of the base.
This is just one of perhaps 100 pic-
tures I could put up.
Is the military ready for climate
change? Well, certainly not the Ma-
rines at Camp Lejeune and Cherry
Point or the Air Force at Tyndall. This
is probably a $4 billion fix-up to rebuild
it. And I will tell you what we are
going to do about it here after I put
this up.
This is actually 2019. You have heard
of the Strategic Air Command. That is
the bombers that carry our nuclear
weapons. This is Offutt Air Force Base
in the Midwest, underwater, the Mis-
souri River, probably a billion dollars
damage here.
You say: Oh, that is just flooding. No,
it is extreme flooding. Extreme weath-
er events. Three bases critical, abso-
lutely critical to the training and the
readiness of our troops.
I think the water has subsided, but
the damage to the buildings has yet to
be repaired—a billion here, $4 billion
there, $3 billion there, and that is not
all.
We know that out in California we
have had our fires. I just showed the
Camp fire, but you may not know that
Port Hueneme, the Naval base in Ven-
tura County just north of Malibu, fire
raged down the hill. They had to evac-
uate the homes for the servicemem-
bers, and there we have it.
b 2030
So we are looking at the new Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act, and
in that act writing in the following
changes to the law, and that is that the
U.S. military, in all of its future con-
struction, will build to the maximum
threat in that area, maybe a tornado,
as it could have been in the Midwest,
or a flood or a hurricane or a deluge or
sea level rise or a fire out in the West.
All future construction will be built to
the maximum threat at that specific
base. That is it.
We are not going to build for yester-
day and just go back and have another
flood or build for yesterday at Tyndall
and see the next hurricane come
through and wipe it out one more time.
We are not going to do that.
At the same time, we are going to
make sure that in that construction
and in the improvements, that they
maximize energy conservation.
The single largest consumer of petro-
leum in this Nation is the U.S. mili-
tary. It is expensive. We are spending a
pile of money, billions of dollars on en-
ergy consumption in the military. We
will emphasize energy conservation,
things such as windows and insulation.
And when we build new, we will build
to the maximum standard for energy
conservation, as well as for resiliency;
that is going to be in the new National
Defense Authorization Act. It is in the
work of the Readiness Subcommittee.
We are going to drive this, and I think
we are going to drive it to success.
And I will say, this is not all new.
The military is aware that climate
change is a threat, but they haven’t
been focused sufficiently, in part be-
cause we, the Congress of the United
States, have not focused it and we have
not said: In your construction, in your
reconstruction, and in the upgrading of
your facilities, you will build to the
maximum threat that you face in that
area. Tornadoes, hurricanes, earth-
quakes, fires, floods, whatever it is,
you must build to the maximum
threat, so that you are resilient, so
that you can come back to provide the
necessary support that may be des-
perately needed.
This is not just in the United States.
There are major construction programs
going on in Guam, out in the Pacific
where we know there is going to be an-
other typhoon, probably within the
next 9 months. So those facilities also
will be built for resiliency.
So these are just a few of the things
that we are working on. We have many,
many others. We know that we can do
better.
We know that as we said with the
words of FDR: ‘‘The test of our
progress is not whether we add more to
the abundance of those who have much;
it is whether we provide enough for
those who have too little.’’
That may be a senior on Social Secu-
rity; it may be a young man or woman
that wants to get an education and is
paying a very high interest rate; it
may be a military family that is living
in a house somewhere across the
United States or around the world, in a
house that is owned by a contractor
that is providing housing for the mili-
tary that is not up-to-date, that is
filled with mold or some other con-
taminant; it may be a military person
that is exposed to some sort of toxic
chemical or toxic smoke, we are going
to make sure that we follow this ad-
vice. It is not for those who have much,
it is for those who have too little,
wherever they may be.
That is our value, that is our goal.
I appreciate the opportunity to share
with everyone several pieces of legisla-
tion that I will be working on together
with my colleagues here in the House
of Representatives.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
f
THE FIVE PILLARS
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Arizona (Mr.
SCHWEIKERT) for 30 minutes.
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I
would say of the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GARAMENDI), it is always
fun listening to him, because, look, we
are friends. We are ideologically sepa-
rated by about, let’s call it a small
ocean, but I think there is this passion
of we can do things in our society that
are good.
Mr. Speaker, I have really appre-
ciated Mr. GARAMENDI sort of embrac-
ing in some of our personal conversa-
tions my sort of techno-utopianism
that the problems the gentleman sees,
the problems I see, that there may be
technology that is about to disrupt so-
ciety in an incredibly positive way.
Mr. GARAMENDI. Will the gen-
tleman yield?
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. I am happy to
yield.
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, the
gentleman does realize how many peo-
ple are creeping out at this moment
that we are friendly to each other.
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, a Re-
publican and Democrat talking to each
other across the aisle.
Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate the
gentleman. I have followed him, and he
has followed me, and we have had the
opportunity to talk. I am just not pre-
pared tonight to go into the kind of de-
tail the gentleman is about to, but he
is absolutely correct. There are solu-
tions. There are solutions to the prob-
lems that confront this Nation, con-
front individuals in the Nation.

H4306 June 4, 2019
Mr. Speaker, I know Mr. SCHWEIKERT
is going to pick up some of that in the
next few minutes as he talks about it,
and I am going to sit down and listen
to the gentleman.
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, we
really need to talk about Mr.
GARAMENDI’s idea of entertainment.
Mr. Speaker, look, this is actually a
point I wish more of our constituents
would actually see. We are actually
quite friendly to each other, even those
of us who may have, you know, what is
pictured as an ideological chasm.
Oddly enough, we all see many of the
same problems, and we are trying to
find a way to get there.
So tonight I wanted to do just one or
two things, because I have picked up a
couple of articles in the news over this
last week that I actually find greatly
optimistic.
So let’s actually sort of start with
our five pillars. And I do this over and
over, because, one more time, what do
many of us, the economists, the staff,
the really smart people that are here,
and then those of us who are regular
Members who were just elected, what is
in many ways the greatest threat to
our society?
We have made lots and lots of prom-
ises, and we don’t have the resources to
keep those promises to those who have
earned benefits.
We actually have a demographic
curve. As a country, we are getting
older very, very fast. In about eight
and a half years: two workers, one re-
tiree. In about eight and a half years,
50 percent of the spending in this body
will be, less interest, to those 65 and
older.
Are we as a government, are we as a
society going to keep our promises?
Mathematically, this has been a pas-
sion of mine for a few years now, try-
ing to find a pro-growth, optimistic
way we keep our promises so my little
3-and-a-half-year-old daughter has the
same opportunities I have had.
So the five pillars we have been
working on is how do I start with—I
am going to start with the very top—
technology disruption.
Tonight I am going to talk about a
couple of really optimistic things that
are happening in healthcare technology
that will keep us healthier and poten-
tially crash the price of healthcare.
I am going to talk about some things
that are happening in environmental
technology that are going to lower the
costs, make energy available so the
economy can keep growing and yet the
environment is cleaner and healthier.
We are going to talk about employ-
ment. How do we actually have more of
our brothers and sisters out there enter
the workforce, stay in the workforce?
There is this concept of labor force
participation. And the economists for
years now have said as the baby
boomers are moving into retirement,
labor force participation is going to
crash mathematically.
We have also had this fragility, this
difficulty of millennial males—oddly
enough, about 6, 7 months ago, millen-
nial females really started to enter the
workforce in droves. We still have a
problem with millennial males.
There is also some really interesting
data popping up that the number of
Americans, by choice, who are over 70
years old, but they are happy, and they
are healthy, are choosing to stay in the
labor force. We have had almost, I
think it was like—the article was talk-
ing about a 50 percent rise in seniors
staying in the labor force just as a
choice by lifestyle, some because they
need the money, many because they
are healthy, and they want to be pro-
ductive. And that is actually really
good for society.
We are actually going to touch on
having to deal with earned benefits and
how we should design those earned ben-
efits. Could we make some offers with-
in those, saying, if you are willing to
stay in the labor force, if you are
healthy and you can do that, should we
give you some spiffs in your benefits. If
you are able to stay on your private in-
surance for a while, could we do some
things.
It is sort of entitlement reform in a
very positive fashion. It has to do with,
how do we maximize economic expan-
sion and choice for those who are sen-
iors?
Population stability. Birth rates
have collapsed in our country. We just
have to deal with the reality of the
math. How do we incentivize family
formation in an effective way? This one
has been really difficult.
We have had an ongoing sort of re-
search project in our office for a couple
of years now looking at things being
done in Canada and Scandinavia and
other parts of the world, even Hungary,
and how ineffective so many programs
have been in encouraging family for-
mation. We are going to have to come
up with sort of an American version of
what works there.
Let’s face it. Having a little person,
they are expensive. It is the greatest
joy of our lives, my wife and I, but we
are going to have to talk about how we
help in family formation.
Then also the other side of that con-
cept of population stability is, what do
we do in immigration? How do we de-
sign immigration to maximize eco-
nomic vitality?
This is going to be a little off subject,
but close; I was sort of heartbroken
about a vote we had here 3 hours ago.
H.R. 6, it was dealing with the DACA
populations. What happens when the
body here engages in votes that become
theatrical, become about exciting your
base, and have no chance of becoming
law?
If the majority here had been serious
and really wanted a solution for the
young people in DACA, there would
have been this opportunity to come
over, talk with Republicans, because
many of us have voted for immigration
reform that actually had modules that
solved much of the DACA issue, but
they had to come together, because
that piece of legislation will not move
through the Senate, will not get the
President’s signature.
In some ways, it is actually sort of
cruel to exploit a population with
promises and a piece of legislation that
we know is never going to move, and
that there was an opportunity to do
something that could have, if we had
actually worked together.
I don’t know if the fear is doing
something that would be seen as bipar-
tisan with this White House, whether
the issue is too powerful, but it breaks
my heart when there are actually
paths that, if we had done border secu-
rity, if we had done some rationaliza-
tion of the dysfunctional mechanisms
we have right now on those asking for
asylum, we could have packaged that
with a solution for much of the DACA
population and it could have actually
moved through the Senate, it could
have gotten the President’s signature.
Instead, we just did theatrics.
Sorry to go off sort of the script here.
So population stability.
Then the last one here, economic
growth. What do we do as a govern-
ment, as a legislative body to maxi-
mize economic expansion?
My theory here is economic expan-
sion is moral. Think about it. Whether
it be the Tax Code, whether it be doing
smart things modernizing regulation,
whether it be doing smart things with
trade, it is moral when we have eco-
nomic growth.
How many of our brothers and sis-
ters—that if you read the economists’
papers a couple years ago—who hadn’t
finished high school, they were being
written off as the permanent
underclass in our society. And today
that very population is the population
that has the fastest growing wages and
almost full employment. That is a
moral thing.
If you actually will come to down-
town Phoenix, we have this homeless
campus in downtown Phoenix. There is
an organization called St. Joseph the
Worker. My understanding is they have
been around for a hundred-some years,
and their job is to get populations that
have had some of the most horrible ex-
periences in life and find them jobs.
b 2045
You walk in the door and they have
a stack of job offers on top of the desk
saying: We just need someone to come
to our restaurant and help us. We just
need someone to come to our little
warehouse and help us stock shelves.
What does it mean in a society where
you have more jobs than you have
available workers? I will argue that
that is incredibly moral, and there
should almost be joy in our society
right now if we could pull away the
sort of rage partisan blinders right now
and say: Isn’t this a neat thing? How do
we do more of it?
It turns out that economic growth is
crucial if we are going to keep our
promises, if we intend to keep our
promises on Medicare, if we intend to

keep our promises on Social Security.
Unless you do all five of these things
and do all five of those well and very
soon, mathematically, it is almost im-
possible to keep our promises. It is not
Republican or Democrat; it is demo-
graphics.
I want to talk about some of the
positive things that technology, that
some of these things are bringing, and
that is one of our key points here. This
is the week we call sort of Member
Week, where Members come to dif-
ferent committees of jurisdiction and
sort of pitch their ideas.
So two or three times today in the
Ways and Means Committee, we had
Members come and talk about their
passion for dealing with different types
of cancers: colorectal screening, lung
cancer, these other things, and then
the current mechanism.
My pitch to everyone who cares
about those issues is: You are abso-
lutely right. We need to protect our
brothers and sisters in this country by
having those types of screenings to find
those cancers as early as possible and
deal with them, but we need to write
the legislation in a fashion where it is
future proofed.
I am sure everyone saw these articles
that have popped up just in the last
couple of weeks. It turns out there is a
breakthrough in blood tests.
Where, in the old days, we would do a
blood test, you would look for a certain
titer, know your body had had an im-
mune reaction to something, what hap-
pens when you can do a blood test that
looks for the cascade—we will call it
the throwing off the dead parts of a
cancer cell—and finds that and says:
Hey, we just found this little piece of
this DNA; we know that is a cancer
DNA; we know what type of cancer it
is; and because of that marker, we can
even know where it is?
It turns out this is in trials right
now, and it is having tremendous suc-
cess. We need to future proof our legis-
lation around here that it is not
enough to care about our brothers and
sisters and that we are going to make
sure our society is providing cancer
screenings, but that it is future proofed
that when a blood test is the least
invasive, most efficient, cost efficient,
easiest to provide, and actually will
crash parts of the price of healthcare in
finding these cancers early, but also
being available as a methodology, when
we do this in large scale, being dra-
matically less expensive than what we
use today.
So part of my pitch here and the rea-
son I do this every week or two is: Un-
derstand this disruption of these tech-
nologies are here. We need to future
proof what we do legislatively because
this is a big deal.
Think of a blood test where you can
find several types of cancer if you have
it and you can find it within a couple
of hours. This is a big deal. So this is
exciting.
The next one I have talked about two
or three times here, but it is the sim-
plest example of another thing we need
to do here.
As we are talking about economic
growth, it is also, what do we do to dis-
rupt the price of healthcare? Remem-
ber the stupid conversation we have
had in this place for years now in re-
gards to healthcare hasn’t been about
the cost, it has been about who pays
and who gets subsidized. My passion is
we need to think differently.
I have come here and done multiple
presentations on the new wearable
technologies: the pill bottle that tells
you when you have opened it, the
things where you can blow into it and
it will diagnose whether you have a
viral infection, and the algorithm can
bounce off your phone’s medical
records and instantly order your
antivirals. That is a disruption. That
lowers the price of healthcare. You got
healthier, and you didn’t infect every-
one else in your family and your busi-
ness.
We need to promote these tech-
nologies, but there is the other side
that is coming.
Well over 50 percent of our
healthcare spending is to those with
chronic conditions. So 5 percent of our
population has those chronic condi-
tions, but they are well over 50 percent
of our spending. What happens if we
started to invest in curing them, cur-
ing our brothers and sisters of chronic
conditions?
Well, guess what Congress did a few
years ago? The Cures Act and some of
these other things, we put lots of
money into researching cures. And
now, with some of the new technology
and now the next generation of
CRISPR and all these other things that
are coming, we are going to have phar-
maceuticals like this. I think they are
often referred to as biologicals. My
hope is it is November, but sometime
within the next 12 months, we expect
to have a single shot cure for hemo-
philia.
I use this as an example because, ap-
parently, there are a number of drugs
in this sort of category that are com-
ing: a single shot cure for the 8,000-plus
of our brothers and sisters in the coun-
try who have hemophilia A. Now,
maybe a million and a half dollars a
shot.
So over here we have talked about
the technology that keeps us healthy.
Over here, I want us to talk about and
start to get our heads around: How do
we finance really expensive but miracle
cures? How do we build a healthcare
bond, a mechanism where, hey, we are
going to have all these savings in the
future. Can we pull some of that for-
ward or commit that savings to actu-
ally finance a bond so, when a pharma-
ceutical like this is available, you cure
the 8,000 Americans who have hemo-
philia?
Back to our 5 percent of our popu-
lation who have chronic conditions.
What happens if we can cure just a cou-
ple percent of that? It is a big deal. It
would change the cost curve of
healthcare. This is a radically different
way of thinking about healthcare.
So what happens when stories like
this actually prove out to be true that
those who are suffering with ALS, that
sometime in the next year or two, we
are going to have a pharmaceutical, it
does not cure at this point, but it sta-
bilizes the horrible regression of one’s
life and abilities that are chewed up by
ALS?
Stop. You may have to have this in-
jection a couple times a year, maybe
four times a year. It may be $100,000
per injection. How do we come up with
a methodology that finances such a
thing because the cost of the progres-
sion of this disease is stunningly ex-
pensive, and it is just the right thing
to do?
It turns out the debate we have had
in this place for years of who pays and
who subsidizes now can be a discussion
of: How do we use technology to dis-
rupt the price of healthcare? How do
we get healthier and personal control
of our healthcare instead of a collec-
tivist vision? And how do we finance
these incredible disruptive pharma-
ceuticals that are coming that either
stabilize or cure that portion of our so-
ciety who have chronic conditions, who
are suffering, but are also much of our
healthcare cost?
This is good news. These are exciting.
There should be joy in this place that
we are part of a time that can have
this type of curative approach to
healthcare and make these sorts of dif-
ferences.
So, look, those are a couple of the
happy things. If we do our job well, if
we get the financing right, we can have
this type of disruption and see it in the
cost curve of healthcare.
So now I want to sort of jump to
some of the other discussions that have
been around this body, particularly
today, a little bit yesterday, on green-
house gases, on climate change, on
those things. My frustration with this
is great rhetoric, really bad math.
So let’s actually talk about a couple
of things that have been going on and
why the rhetoric doesn’t match reality.
I believe, actually, technology and
those on the more conservative side ac-
tually have solutions that grow the
economy, provide opportunities for our
family, provide the opportunities. Re-
member our five points that, if we
don’t have the economic expansion, we
can’t keep our promises.
So just as a point of reference, I
brought these two slides again. This
one is from 2015. The yellow over there
is all the photovoltaic in the country
that was added in 2015. It was a miracu-
lous year, over 38 gigawatts of new gen-
eration, power generation, solar. Isn’t
that wonderful? Except we took 33
gigawatts of power generation out of
nuclear.
We really didn’t gain that much in
clean noncarbon-producing or non-
greenhouse-producing energy. You
can’t have one without the other. You
can’t run around and say: Didn’t we do

great? Look, we added all the solar,
how much cleaner the world got. Oh,
by the way, we shut down all this nu-
clear, so actually our baseload didn’t
really go anywhere.
Well, it turns out that math was
pretty much the exact same the next
year. Once again, the yellow is the pho-
tovoltaic that was added. The multi-
color here is the amount of nuclear
that came offline. It turns out more
nuclear came offline, in a weird way,
because of the loss of all that nuclear
baseload generation.
The photovoltaic that came to the
market, which is wonderful—I am from
Arizona. I love it. But we didn’t get
any better on power generation that
doesn’t produce greenhouse gases.
So once again, around here, we need
to open our minds and understand just
sort of basic math that you can’t be
joyful about one and not be supportive
of the other and actually be making
mathematical progress. It is just math.
So back to a thought experiment. I
did this on the floor the other day, and
I am going to do it again just because
it did create some really interesting
phone calls.
I am going to believe this one here
might end up being the single biggest
disruption in my life. And forgive me if
I don’t get everything perfect here, but
about 4 or 5 months ago, reading some
strange journal—that is what happens
when you are on a plane 10 hours a
week; you read a lot of stuff—there was
this article. We have vetted it repeat-
edly, and it appears it is real.
U.S. labs from universities have sort
of broken the Holy Grail in regards to
plant biology. Bear with me. This is a
big deal.
What would happen tomorrow if the
next generation of agriculture was 40
percent more productive? It would be a
miracle. You would feed the world for
the next 250 years.
Think about if you had a 40 percent
improvement in agriculture, how much
less water, fuel, what does it do to land
prices?
Well, it turns out if you really care
about the environment and greenhouse
gases, here is your thought experiment
I want you to struggle through.
World agriculture produces about 2.2
times more greenhouse gases than
every car on Earth. So if you had a 40
percent improvement in agriculture
productivity, it would be as if you re-
moved every car off the face of the
Earth. You just have to be willing to
eat seed stock that functionally, actu-
ally, is a type of GMO.
Now, all they did is change some of
the cell biology so it grabs the carbon
molecule every time instead of acci-
dentally grabbing the oxygen molecule
and then spending lots of energy trying
to purge the oxygen, which apparently
is just one of the inherent faults in na-
ture. They fixed it.
b 2100
They did it with tobacco plants. We
always use tobacco plants because that
is a genome we have known. I guess
that is the first one we broke. But now
they are moving into other types of ag-
ricultural stock.
Be prepared. Watch for this. This
technology may be one of the biggest
disruptions.
But as a body, when we talk about
global warming, when we talk about
this, how much of this body is ready to
understand there is technology com-
ing? Are Members willing to embrace
the technology instead of the sort of
Malthusian view that we need to
shrink as an economy, that we need to
be controlled, that we need to be man-
aged? Or do Members allow these mar-
ket forces to be incredibly disruptive?
I didn’t bring the slides this time,
but in that same stock, think about
some of the other things going on. Ap-
parently, there has been a huge break-
through in the technology of pulling
carbon right out of the air, being able
to take that carbon, mix it with some
other chemicals, and turn it back into
a fuel stock—negative carbon emission,
economically done. I am looking for-
ward to the joy coming from my envi-
ronmental friends who understand.
We have already proven that carbon
sequestration works. We have proven
that we can generate power with coal,
with natural gas, without a smoke-
stack, and capture every bit of carbon
and then reuse it, sequester it, if we
choose. But now we are going to nega-
tive carbon mining.
Why that is really important is, how
many people believe that China with
the 30-plus new coal plants that are
going up as part of the Belt and Road
Initiative, that they are going to have
lots of great scrubbers on them?
Once again, if the goal is to punish
the United States, great, the rhetoric
is brilliant. If the goal is to grow as a
society but still be cleaner, go with
pro-economic expansion embracing of
technology and let us have jobs. Let us
have economic expansion so we can
keep our promises.
The last thought experiment I am
going to give tonight, remember how a
little while ago I mentioned this is sort
of Member week? We call it pitch week,
where a Member will come pitch their
priorities, pitch their ideas in the dif-
ferent committees of jurisdiction. We
are hoping that Members we are al-
ready working with will go to the com-
mittees that do certain types of foreign
aid.
How many out there care about plas-
tic in the ocean? How many think ban-
ning straws in communities is going to
do anything about plastic in the ocean?
If a Member believes that, they have
been conned. It is great virtue sig-
naling, ‘‘Hey, I am banning straws,’’
but it is absurd.
Mr. Speaker, 90 percent of the plastic
in the ocean comes from 10 rivers,
eight of them in Asia, two in Africa.
Let’s do something that actually
works.
If we are going to have foreign aid
and some of the environmental pro-
grams and these things that are out in
the world, let’s go to those 10 rivers
and start removing the plastic.
Let’s add value. Let’s do those
things. If 90 percent of the plastic in
the ocean is coming from 10 rivers—
eight in Asia, two in Africa—we know
where it is coming from. It may not
provide the virtue signaling oppor-
tunity that we enjoy around here, but
it would make the oceans cleaner.
For once, could we drop some of the
political theater? Just like the vote we
had earlier today, where it is great pol-
itics, gins up the base, gives us some-
thing to rally around, but it doesn’t ac-
complish anything.
Mr. Speaker, please, to my Demo-
cratic friends, to my Republican
friends, are we here to do good?
My pitch to Members is that we
know the problems, and we know the
math—let’s be honest about that
math—so let’s actually do things.
In the next week or two, when we are
starting to put together our appropria-
tions, our policy sets, is there anyone
out there on the other side who will
help me say, for the 10 rivers in the
world that are 90 percent of the plastic
in the ocean, can we adjust that bilat-
eral aid, the foreign aid, the environ-
mental guidance, the other things we
do, go to those 10 rivers and start to do
something? We might lose the political
issue and make the environment bet-
ter. Or will we just stick around here
and say that we don’t need to solve the
problem because we want to be able to
talk about it?
Sorry for the sarcasm, but I am frus-
trated that we are living in a time of
amazing opportunity, of technology
disruption, where if Members really
care about healthcare, we are on the
cusp of a crash of its price, but yet its
quality and its cures are here. Can we
break down some of the barriers that
are stopping us from getting there?
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.

CRISIS AT THE BORDER
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes.
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to recount observations I have
after spending 2 days of the Memorial
Day recess at the Laredo Sector of the
Texas border.
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman
SCHWEIKERT for giving me good infor-
mation on his musings. I feel very hon-
ored to follow Congressman
SCHWEIKERT.
Now, we have a crisis. I think it is
perhaps the biggest crisis of my life-
time, as far as the future of America,
going on at our border.
In May, 133,000 people attempted to
cross the border and were recorded by
the Border Patrol. It is worth remem-
bering that they do not record every-
body. There are people who sneak

through. And it is worth remembering
that there is a smaller number of peo-
ple who are apprehended by Customs
agents at the designated points of
entry.
By point of reference, the 133,000 peo-
ple in Mexico can be compared to 48,000
people who crossed in January. In
other words, over time, for whatever
reason, we have a dramatically greater
number of people coming into this
country. I will point out that this is
the most, in many years.
Many years ago—say, 15 years ago—if
we looked back and found 100,000 people
crossing the border, it was nowhere
near as serious. At that time, we would
frequently have people come, and they
would be caught and sent back. The
same person may try three or four
times, so it wasn’t as many people
crossing the border.
I should also point out, of the 133,000
caught by the Border Patrol, 11,000 are
unaccompanied minors.
I frequently hear people complain
that we are breaking up families. What
is going on is that young children—in
any event, people under age 18—are
coming here on their own.
Another thing that is going on is
that we are seeing people from more or
different countries come across. I as-
sume that is because the word is out,
not only in Mexico and Central Amer-
ica but even in the Eastern Hemi-
sphere, that the United States is not
enforcing our immigration law.
In the Laredo Sector, if Members
talk to Customs folks, the number one
country for people coming across the
border is Venezuela. Number two is
Cuba. Number three is Congo. So even
from the Eastern Hemisphere, people
are flooding here.
While I was down there, the Border
Patrol caught a group of 116 people, all
Africans coming in from Congo, An-
gola, and Cameroon, 116 in one haul.
What does this mean? First of all, in
addition to great changes in our coun-
try, it means the Border Patrol is over-
whelmed. The amount of paperwork,
understandably, wherever we are
today, there is a tremendous amount of
paperwork. The amount of paperwork
the Border Patrol has to do takes them
off the border, takes them off the rea-
son they volunteered to be part of the
Border Patrol. This means even more
people are coming across the border.
Furthermore, the Border Patrol has
to work in dangerous positions. We
have followed them as they have fol-
lowed the Rio Grande River in the La-
redo Sector in the middle of the night
with one person per vehicle. We can
imagine what it is like patrolling on
very slow roads with a lot of foliage on
both sides of the roads. Some of the en-
vironmentalists wouldn’t let them cut
it down. We may have groups of 9 or 10
people coming across the border. Very
dangerous.
The first thing that should be done
is, immediately, this Congress ought to
appropriate more monies for the Bor-
der Patrol. Right now, they have 2,000
empty positions, and the number of po-
sitions they have is drawn out over a
much smaller number of people.
We also have to improve the equip-
ment the Border Patrol has and in-
crease the number of dogs. While down
on the border, we watched the great job
dogs can do in pursuing people. It is ex-
pensive for these dogs. But be it at the
designated points of entry where they
sniff out drugs or sniff out cash, or out
in the field with the Border Patrol,
they make them much more effective.
It is ridiculous that our Border Pa-
trol also has equipment that is some-
times not as good as what the cartels
have. The cartels control the border.
With the exception of these big entou-
rages, nobody gets across the border
without approval of the cartels.
The next thing to point out, as we
deal with people coming across the bor-
der, when the cartels bring them across
the border, they may not take them to
safety. They may just direct people in
a certain direction or so far as they are
escorting people to a place where they
can be picked up in the United States.
If somebody is too weak and can’t
make it, they don’t call 911. They just
leave them there to dehydrate and per-
haps die.
In the last year, in the Tucson Sec-
tor, about 250 people were found dehy-
drated or dying of something.
This is another result of the United
States’ open border policy in which we
encourage people who are expecting us
to ignore immigration laws to come to
the United States.
In the Laredo Sector, it is not quite
as bad. About 50 people die of dehydra-
tion every year. But there, where many
more people cross the Rio Grande, it is
not unusual to have people drown. In
the 2 days that I was there, they found
another person who had drowned.
The reason they drown is that people
think it is shallow enough to walk
across the Rio Grande, but there are
people who can’t swim. We have a situ-
ation in which there is an undertow in
the Rio Grande, and people, including
children, wind up dying there.
Again, how do we deal with it? We
should be creating a situation where
people think we are enforcing our laws,
so they are not tempted to do such
dangerous things.
Another thing we found out is that,
among people who are crossing the bor-
der, if they are not part of a family
unit, they are much more dangerous
than they were 10 years ago.
Mr. Speaker, 10 years ago, the type of
people crossing the border might be the
types looking to work on a farm in
Wisconsin. It is much more common to
get the criminal element, much more
common to get the MS13 gangs from El
Salvador. That is kind of a subjective
determination from the Border Patrol,
but they find it of great concern be-
cause they love their country, and they
see whom we are letting in our country
and where the future Americans are
going to come from.
What can we do to stop 133,000 people
from coming in this country every
month? We have to stop the carrot that
keeps people coming.
First of all, we should deal with
birthright citizenship. Again, the
United States is one of only two of the
40th wealthiest countries in the world
that allows people to become citizens
because they were born here.
We hear more stories of people com-
ing over here. Women are coming over
here 8 months pregnant, having a baby,
knowing that the baby will be an
American citizen. And eventually, be-
cause of family-related laws, they will
be able to come into the country.
Secondly, and President Trump can
do this alone, I believe, we have to get
rid of the practice of giving work per-
mits to people who come here for asy-
lum purposes, knowing that they prob-
ably will not show up for an asylum
hearing. Giving a work permit encour-
ages people to break the law.
Then, we need more judges on the
border with regard to these immigra-
tion problems. Right now, what goes on
is that people come here looking for
asylum. They are given a court date 2
or 3 or 5 years out.
I am told that they even tell Border
Patrol agents that they know they are
ineligible for asylum. They tell Border
Patrol agents that they will not show
up for their hearing in 5 or 6 years.
That has to stop.
b 2115
That has got to stop, and the way to
make it stop is hire more judges, put
those judges right on the border, and
do not let people in the country assum-
ing that they are here legally.
I mean, they are going to wind up
with a work permit and they are going
to wind up being part of our culture
even though they are here illegally.
Next thing to do, and I am not going
to spend a lot of time on this because
we talked about it before, but every
Border Patrol agent I have talked to in
the Tucson sector, or in the Laredo
sector, says we need a wall. In sum-
mary, we must act now or we will lose
our country. We cannot continue to
take 100,000 people crossing the border
inappropriately every month.
I want to point out, I am not talking
about legal immigration. Every year in
this country, we swear in 700,000 new
people as citizens. In this country right
now, we have about 4 million people
here on work permits. So it is not like
we are anti-immigrant. A lot of people
can come here.
When I talk about the 130,000 people
who came here in May and largely wind
up in the United States, I am talking
about people who are coming here and
should not be here.
We are being inundated and it will
eventually sink our country. I ask
President Trump to do all he can. It is
very obvious that Congress does not
get the degree of the crisis. We should
have appropriated the money already,
instead of what we did yesterday, as we
spent more money on welfare pro-
grams.

H4310 June 4, 2019
By the way, we know from talking to
people, even in Wisconsin, that there
are a lot of people here illegally who
are getting welfare, to boot. President
Trump should revoke the work permits
that people are getting if they are here
for asylum reasons because we know
the vast majority of people who are
seeking asylum probably are not eligi-
ble for it, and we do not want to en-
courage more of that.
In any event, I encourage my col-
leagues to take this crisis at the bor-
der, 130,000 a month, seriously. I en-
courage the press to do more to report
on it because, obviously, this is perma-
nently going to change America. I en-
courage President Trump to do all he
can do without the assistance of Con-
gress, because the reason we are get-
ting so many more is the word is out.
Again, it is not just in Mexico or
Central America. The word is out in
South America. The word is out in
Cuba. The word is out in Africa. The
word is out in Asia. America is not en-
forcing our immigration laws. And
until we turn around the attitude that
is out there among people, that percep-
tion, we are going to continue to have
growing numbers.
It is going to go over 130,000. It is
going to be 150,000. It is going to be
170,000 a month. America is really
going to be inundated, and we have to
act quickly.

MATERIAL
REVISION TO THE AGGREGATES, ALLOCATIONS,
AND OTHER BUDGETARY LEVELS FOR FISCAL
YEAR 2020
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET,
Washington, DC, June 4, 2019.
MADAM SPEAKER: Pursuant to the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974 (CBA), the Bal-
anced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control
Act of 1985 (BBEDCA), and H. Res. 293 (116th

This revision is for allowable adjustments
for amounts for Overseas Contingency Oper-
ations, wildfire suppression, and the 2020
Census, pursuant to section 251(b) of
BBEDCA or H. Res. 293. The amounts for
Overseas Contingency Operations are con-
tained in the texts of H.R. 2839, the Depart-
ment of State, Foreign Operations, and Re-
lated Programs Appropriations Act, 2020, and
H.R. 2968, the Department of Defense Appro-
priations Act, 2020, as reported by the Com-
mittee on Appropriations. The amounts for
wildfire suppression and the 2020 Census are
contained respectively in the text of H.R.
3052, the Department of the Interior, Envi-
ronment, and Related Agencies Appropria-
tions Act, 2020 and H.R. 3055 the Commerce,
Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Ap-
propriations Act, 2020, as reported by the
Committee on Appropriations.
Accordingly, I am revising aggregate
spending levels for fiscal year 2020 and the
allocation for the House Committee on Ap-
propriations for fiscal year 2020. For pur-
poses of enforcing titles III and IV of the
CBA and other budgetary enforcement provi-
sions, the revised aggregates and allocations
are to be considered as aggregates and allo-
cations included in the budget resolution,
pursuant to the Statement published in the
Congressional Record on May 3, 2019, as ad-
justed.
Questions may be directed to Jennifer
Wheelock or Raquel Spencer of the Budget

Vol. 165 WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, JUNE 4, 2019 No. 93
Senate
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was
called to order by the President pro
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. To-
day’s opening prayer will be offered by
the Reverend Pat Conroy, S.J., Chap-
lain of the House of Representatives.
f
PRAYER
The guest Chaplain offered the fol-
lowing prayer:
Let us pray.
Divine Potter, take the misshapen
clay that we are and fashion us into
vessels of Your honor.
Open the hearts of our Senators to
the fullness of life, forgiveness of sins,
and the hope of eternity with You.
Remind our lawmakers of Your wis-
dom in Luke 12:48, which states: ‘‘From
everyone who has been given much,
much will be demanded, and from the
one who has been entrusted with much,
much more will be added.’’
Lord, may our legislators realize how
much they have been given and strive
to use their gifts for Your glory.
We pray in Your most merciful
Name. Amen.

EXECUTIVE SESSION
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
read the nomination of Andrew M.
Saul, of New York, to be Commissioner
of Social Security for the term expir-
ing January 19, 2025. (Reappointment)
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
President pro tempore.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent to speak as in
morning business for 1 minute.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
HEALTHCARE
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
would like to take a minute to explain
why Medicare for All is a prescription
for Medicare for None. Some folks are
pitching this wild, misguided idea that
one-size-fits-all government insurance
is a cure-all for what ails the patients
and the people of the United States of
America. This conversation needs a
strong dose of reality medicine.
Let’s look at what is really being
proposed—Medicare for None. Here is
what it would do. It would dump 181
million Americans off their private
health insurance plans, double your in-
come taxes, and put patients with pre-
existing conditions and chronic dis-
eases on long waiting lists for medical
care. It would unravel the current
health safety net for seniors and people
with disabilities, make the government
the gatekeeper between Americans and
their doctors, and, finally, put every
single American who works for private
health insurance out of business and
out of a job.
The politics behind the proposal is
simple: free healthcare. Let me remind
my fellow Americans that if it sounds
too good to be true, it is too good to be
true.
Medicare for All is a catchy slogan.
When you hear it on the campaign
trail, remember it really boils down to
government-run healthcare.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
I ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Before the Senate
adjourned for Memorial Day, I laid out
seven more nominations for our consid-
eration when we returned—four to fill
important vacancies in the administra-
tion and three to the Federal bench. So
this week, the Senate will continue our
work to confirm more well-qualified
nominees and finally let the American
people’s President have more of his
team on the job.
Yesterday we began by voting to ad-
vance the nomination of Andrew Saul,
of New York, to be Commissioner of
Social Security. Mr. Saul is a graduate
of the Wharton School at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania and has spent dec-
ades building a successful career in
business and in public administration.
In addition to his experience in finan-
cial management, Mr. Saul has pre-
viously served as vice chairman of the
New York Metropolitan Transportation
Authority and as Chairman of the Fed-
eral Retirement Thrift Investment
Board, where he oversaw programs re-
lied upon by literally millions of Amer-
icans.
It is no surprise that our colleagues
on the Finance Committee voted
unanimously to favorably report Mr.
Saul’s nomination to the full Senate. I
hope Members will reach the same con-
clusion and support his confirmation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3172 June 4, 2019
Later, we will turn to the consider-
ation of David Schenker, of New Jer-
sey, to be Assistant Secretary of State
for Near Eastern Affairs; Heath
Tarbert, of Maryland, to be Chairman
of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission; Susan Combs, of Texas, to
be Assistant Secretary of the Interior;
and three nominees to preside in a dis-
trict court and the Court of Federal
Claims.
In each case, the President has put
forward impressive and uncontroversial
individuals who, I might add, in a pre-
vious era, would have been candidates
for a voice vote. They are thoroughly
qualified for public service. Their
nominations should not have been de-
layed even this long.
In the case of Mr. Schenker, for ex-
ample, our colleagues have forced the
top Middle East job at the State De-
partment to remain open for 1 year.
This is the top job at the State Depart-
ment for the Middle East, and they
have kept it open for 1 year—a year
that brought no shortage of crises in
that region.
So I am glad we are continuing to get
things back on track. I hope our col-
leagues will join me in voting to put
each of these public servants to work
for the American people.
100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, today, June 4, 2019, marks a his-
toric anniversary for the U.S. Senate.
It was 100 years ago today that this
body passed the 19th Amendment to
the Constitution and sent it on to the
States for ratification. It was 100 years
ago today that this institution finally
recognized that American women de-
served the right to vote just the same
as men.
Of course, this victory for equality
and fairness had been a long time in
the making. The very same text that
would become the 19th Amendment was
first introduced in the Senate more
than 40 years before, back in 1878. It
was 40 years between the first intro-
duction and the final passage. It was
introduced by Senator Aaron Sargent
of California, who, with his wife, was a
close friend of Susan B. Anthony’s.
When it finally received a vote nearly a
decade later, there were twice as many
votes against it as for it. By 1914, there
had been progress. When it received an-
other vote that year, it failed by only
11 votes. By February 1919, there was
more progress, losing by just one vote.
The old justifications were eroding.
Our Nation’s true principles and clear
logic were chipping away at this old
mistake.
Then, precisely one century ago
today, the right thing to do became un-
deniable. Women’s suffrage cleared the
Senate floor. The rollcall vote was 56
to 25—2 more than two-thirds. News-
paper accounts tell us that several
minutes of sustained applause and
cheers filled the Gallery. Then the 39
words that would become the 19th
Amendment were on their way to the
States, on their way to concluding a 42-
year journey and becoming enshrined
in our Constitution.
Of course, this chapter of Senate his-
tory is just a tiny slice of the incred-
ible uphill battle that the broader
women’s rights and suffrage movement
waged in American politics and in cul-
ture. There were the pioneering think-
ers of the Seneca Falls Convention,
such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and
Lucretia Mott, and their famous Dec-
laration of Sentiments. There was the
incredible, history-changing intellec-
tual and strategic partnership between
Stanton and Susan B. Anthony and the
prolific writing, coalition-building, and
grassroots activism it produced.
There were devoted organizers, such
as Carrie Chapman Catt, Ida B. Wells,
and Mary Church Terrell, and so many
more—both the dynamic leaders whom
history remembers and the millions
more women and men who lent their
support to the cause and who made
quiet contributions of their own.
Some of them lived to see the fruits
of their work become part of our Con-
stitution, and many did not, but the
progress we celebrate would not have
been possible—it would have been lit-
erally unimaginable—without them.
So this milestone brought one chap-
ter of hard work to an end, but it really
started a new chapter in our history as
American women became more and
more integrated into our democracy. It
was just 6 years after the 19th Amend-
ment was ratified that my own State of
Kentucky elected our first female
Member of Congress, Katherine Lang-
ley, to the House of Representatives.
I could not be more glad that the
Senate will spend today commemo-
rating this historic milestone. This
afternoon, I know a number of our col-
leagues plan to come to the floor to de-
scribe the history and significance of
this day in much more depth. Later, we
will vote on a resolution to officially
mark the centennial of our prede-
cessors’ historic vote.
Several more Senators have been
working on additional legislation to
help our Nation mark the whole year of
commemoration that begins this spring
and will continue through the anniver-
sary of final ratification.
I want to thank a number of our col-
leagues who helped lead the prepara-
tion for this. In particular, thanks to
Senator COLLINS for her leadership in
coordinating today and focusing the
Senate’s attention on this milestone.
Thanks to Senator MURKOWSKI, the
lead sponsor for the resolution we will
be voting on this afternoon. Thanks to
our colleagues Senators BLACKBURN,
FEINSTEIN, ERNST, and others for their
hard work.
I would also like to thank the mem-
bers of the Women’s Suffrage Centen-
nial Commission, led by Chairwoman
Kay Coles James and former Senator
Barbara Mikulski, the Vice Chair, and
their staff, including executive director
Rebecca Kleefisch and Anna Laymon.
Madam President, 100 years ago
today, American women’s right to vote
was up for debate in this Chamber for
the last time. As one Member of this
body remarked on June 4, 1919, ‘‘The
advocates of the Susan B. Anthony
amendment have won a great victory
and are justly entitled to all the praise
and honor which comes with the win-
ning of a battle which has been fought
for so long a time . . . the right of suf-
frage [for] those noble, patriotic, and
splendid women of our country who
have so long fought for this right and
who so richly deserve [it].’’
Today we reflect on our gratitude for
that work, and we rejoice in that vic-
tory.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader is recognized.
BORDER SECURITY
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
too much of our conversation about
migrants seeking to enter at the south-
ern border has to do with what happens
when they get here. Not enough of our
conversation concerns how we deal
with the problems in the countries
from which the migrants are coming.
Many of these migrants are fleeing vi-
cious gang violence, corruption, domes-
tic abuse, drug cartels, and economic
hardships that are so severe that they
would risk a journey of 1,000 miles on
foot rather than to stay where they
are.
We simply have to do more to help
the countries from which these folks
are coming to fix the problems that are
causing their people to flee. That is
getting at the root causes here, not at
just putting on a bandaid after they
get to the border, and that may be the
most effective way to deal with the
overall issue. Unfortunately and as
usual, the Trump administration has
done the opposite. Its policies are exac-
erbating the vicious conditions in these
Central American countries.
President Trump has cut $450 million
in security assistance to Central Amer-
ican countries and has provided no in-
formation about why the cuts have
taken place and where the money will
go. As usual, it seems it is sort of on a
whim. He gets this idea in his head and
spews it out without checking it and
without explaining it even when it has
the consequence he doesn’t want,
which is more people coming to our
southern border.
Now what the President has proposed
are tariffs on Mexico that would be
massively destabilizing to our economy
and theirs—a policy that will only lead
to more migration. These whimsical
and erratic proposals by the President
that seem to pop into his head and
with which he goes forward without

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3173
June 4, 2019
checking are making a mess of what is
going on at the southern border.
So I would say to the President:
There is a much better way to address
the migration issue than with tariffs.
Deal with the problems in the Central
American countries that are causing
the migration in the first place.
The Democrats have proposed legisla-
tion that would do just that—stem the
tide of migrants and help to reduce the
backlog of cases. How?
First, allow asylum seekers to apply
for asylum in their home countries. If
the people under all of this gang vio-
lence and viciousness and economic
hardship would be able to apply for
asylum in Honduras or in Guatemala
or in El Salvador instead of having to
take a dangerous and often expensive
1,000-mile trek, they would do it. Why
don’t we do that? Let’s increase the
number of immigration judges so there
could be adjudication rather quickly,
and let’s build the capacity of Central
American countries to crack down on
the violent gangs and vicious drug car-
tels.
Our bill would provide $1.5 billion in
security assistance to these countries,
which is far more than the Trump ad-
ministration has cut, but it is still
nonsensical to have cut this money.
This administration gets in its own
way almost every day, but the solu-
tions we proposed are the types we
should debate.
So we are going to push forward with
these proposals. Democrats will seek to
add these policies to any package of
border legislation that comes here be-
fore the Senate. If no legislation deal-
ing with the border comes up, Demo-
crats will seek to add security assist-
ance for Central American countries to
an appropriations bill and push for lan-
guage that requires the administration
to use it. This is so important that we
will push hard in whatever vehicle we
can find to move this proposal.
Again, all of these policies would
have a far greater impact, with far less
disruption, than slapping tariffs on one
of our Nation’s largest trading part-
ners.
Now, frankly, I don’t believe Presi-
dent Trump will actually go through
with the tariffs. When he doesn’t, we
should be ready to proceed to these
commonsense policies instead.
President Trump has a habit of talk-
ing tough and then retreating because
his tough talk can’t be implemented or
doesn’t make sense. President Trump
has a habit of proposing asinine and
dangerous policies before backing off,
and President Trump has a habit of
pretending that the very act of not fol-
lowing through on a misguided policy
is somehow a victory. I wouldn’t be
surprised at all if President Trump
didn’t follow through on these tariffs
either.
We Democrats have proposed a much
better solution to the problems the
President is talking about, and when
the President backs off on tariffs, as I
believe he will, this is a solution ready
to go that can get bipartisan support
that can actually stem the problems
we have at our southern border.
100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT
Madam President, next, on the 19th
Amendment anniversary, today we ob-
serve the 100th anniversary of the 19th
Amendment by the U.S. Senate—a crit-
ical step in the long march for equality
that began at the very founding of our
country, when Abigail Adams impor-
tuned her husband to ‘‘remember the
ladies’’ when drafting the Constitution,
a reminder that fell on deaf ears. It was
a march that gathered numbers and
force at Seneca Falls, under the leader-
ship of brave New Yorkers like Eliza-
beth Cady Stanton, and found expres-
sion in the abolitionist movement.
While that march for equality under
the law achieved a great and long-over-
due victory 100 years ago, it is still not
over. We have a lot to do. Wearing the
yellow rose is wonderful, but it is not
enough.
When women in the workplace do 100
percent of the work but only earn 80
percent of the pay as a man in the
same position, the march is not over.
When good legislation like the
House-passed Violence Against Women
Act to provide justice to survivors of
domestic violence and stalking lan-
guishes in this Chamber in a legislative
graveyard because the NRA is opposed
to it, that march is not over.
When the States are passing laws
making it harder for minorities to
vote, when State parties gerrymander
districts to limit minority representa-
tion, and when the Supreme Court pre-
tends that discrimination no longer ex-
ists in this country and guts the Vot-
ing Rights Act, the march to equality
and universal suffrage is not over.
Without universal suffrage, democ-
racy is incomplete. That was the lesson
of the women who organized, protested,
and compelled their government to
pass the 19th Amendment by the slim-
mest of margins. So let us not consider
June 4 a day to look back with compla-
cency and remark on our historical
progress, but rather as a day to look
forward and recognize what we still
must achieve.
There is no shortage of good work we
could take up here in the Senate—pay-
check fairness, Violence Against
Women Act, the Equality Act, voting
rights, election reform—to make sure
all Americans can enjoy the full bless-
ings of liberty. These pieces of legisla-
tion have passed the House and ended
up in the legislative graveyard of the
Senate. I can think of no better way to
honor the legacy of the suffragists than
to continue their work on breaking
down barriers and strengthening our
democracy.
ELECTION SECURITY
Madam President, finally, on elec-
tion security, today’s anniversary
should also be a reminder of how pre-
cious our elections are and how we
must guarantee that they continue to
be fair and to be free.
Last week, Mr. Mueller reminded us
once again that Russia conducted a
malign campaign to interfere in our
2016 elections. Director Wray and our
intelligence community leaders have
issued clear and unambiguous warnings
that foreign powers will try to do it
again in 2020.
The Senate must act on this. How
can we sit by idly with our arms folded
complacently while foreign countries
try to interfere with our democracy—
our beautiful, wonderful democracy?
We have bipartisan legislation ready
right now to harden our election infra-
structure and to hold foreign powers
accountable for trying to meddle in our
elections, but so far, much to our dis-
may—much to the Nation’s dismay—
Leader MCCONNELL has not indicated
any openness to have this body con-
sider it.
As frustrating as that is, we have
made progress on my request for an all-
Senators briefing on the threats of
election meddling. We should hear
from our leaders of the FBI and Home-
land Security about the upcoming
threats. Director Wray has already said
something publicly about this.
Now, the good news here is that I
spoke to the Republican leader, Leader
MCCONNELL, and he has agreed to hold
such an all-Senators briefing. We
haven’t gotten a date yet. I urge him
to hold it as soon as possible, and cer-
tainly it should take place during this
work period. This briefing should only
be the beginning—the beginning only—
of a larger conversation about the
steps we must take to secure our elec-
tions.
Ladies and gentlemen, Democrats
and Republicans, Americans, this is
not optional. There aren’t two sides to
this issue. Our democracy was at-
tacked, and we—both Democrats and
Republicans—must take steps to pre-
vent an attack in the future.
I yield the floor.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, be-
fore I begin, I would like to take just a
second to mention the resolution the
Senate will be passing this week cele-
brating the 100th anniversary of the
passage and ratification of the 19th
Amendment.
This was a landmark moment in the
history of freedom in our country—a
major step forward in realizing Amer-
ica’s promise of liberty. It is an impor-
tant moment to celebrate, and I look
forward to voting for this resolution
this week and honoring all the women
whose courage resulted in the 19th
Amendment’s passage.
STREAMLINE ACT
Madam President, just a few years
ago, a lot of our current technology
would have been unthinkable—watch-
ing a football game on your phone,
using an app to see who is ringing the
doorbell at your house while you are
across town at work, ordering groceries
using your computer, or, with voice-ac-
tivated technologies like Alexa, put-
ting groceries in your online cart with-
out even having to click a button.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3174 June 4, 2019
But while the technological advances
of the last couple of decades have been
tremendous, there is a lot more to
come. The 5G mobile broadband tech-
nology will deliver speeds that are 100
times faster than what today’s tech-
nology can deliver. It will be vastly
more responsive than 4G technology,
and it will be able to connect 100 times
the number of devices that can be con-
nected with 4G.
It is hard to imagine. After all, our
devices today are pretty fast and re-
sponsive as it is, but 5G will be much,
much faster. That means near-instant
responsiveness from your phone and
computer, but it means a lot more than
that.
So 5G will enable massive break-
throughs in healthcare, transportation,
agriculture, and other key industries,
and 5G will pave the way for auto-
mated vehicles, which have the poten-
tial to dramatically reduce traffic inju-
ries and fatalities. It will facilitate
surgical innovation and new ways to
treat chronic illnesses and to heal inju-
ries.
It will allow precision agriculture to
take off, empowering America’s farm-
ers and ranchers to make better deci-
sions about field management and sub-
stantially increase their crop yields.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture es-
timates that precision agriculture will
reduce farmers’ operational costs by up
to $25 per acre and increase farmers’
yields by up to 70 percent by the year
2050.
The technology for 5G is already
here, but it requires more than simply
having the technology to make 5G a re-
ality. In order to deploy 5G, wireless
providers need access to sufficient
spectrum, and they need to be able to
deploy the infrastructure needed to
support the technology in a reasonable
and timely manner.
Last year, the President signed the
bipartisan MOBILE NOW Act. It was
legislation that I had introduced to
help secure adequate spectrum for 5G
technology.
Yesterday, along with Senator
SCHATZ, I reintroduced the STREAM-
LINE Small Cell Deployment Act to
address the other part of the 5G equa-
tion, and that is infrastructure. The 5G
technology will require not just tradi-
tional cell phone towers but small an-
tennas called small cells that can often
be attached to existing infrastructure
like utility poles or buildings.
Everybody has seen the cell phone
towers rising a couple hundred feet
into the air. This is going to be a dif-
ferent type of technology.
I was encouraged to see the Federal
Communications Commission under
Chairman Pai’s leadership modernize
its regulations on the approval for
small cells, but more work can and
should be done. That is where the
STREAMLINE Act comes in.
My STREAMLINE Act updates cur-
rent law to better reflect emerging
technology. It will expedite the deploy-
ment of small cells while respecting
the role of State and local governments
in making deployment decisions. Im-
portantly, it will make it more afford-
able to bring 5G to rural areas by ad-
dressing the costs of small cell deploy-
ment.
Too often, rural areas, like those in
my home State of South Dakota, have
lagged behind when it comes to getting
the most modern broadband tech-
nology. It is important that we remove
barriers to deployment in rural areas
so that rural communities can have the
same access to the benefits of 5G.
In addition to fostering tremendous
technological breakthroughs in every-
thing from agriculture to energy, 5G
has the potential to add $500 billion to
the economy and to create millions of
new jobs. But in order to achieve those
economic benefits, we need to stay at
the head of the 5G revolution.
The United States lagged behind
other countries in deploying 2G and 3G
technology, which had real economic
consequences. Europe, for example,
took the lead in 2G and cornered most
of the market in sales of networking
equipment and telecom hardware. As
4G emerged, however, the United
States’ wireless industry stepped for-
ward, investing billions in 4G deploy-
ment. The government also took steps
to support the wireless industry, free-
ing up spectrum and making it easier
to deploy the necessary infrastructure.
That is what we need to do again
today. If we want to stay at the head of
the race to 5G, the government needs
to make sure that wireless companies
have access to the necessary spectrum
and the ability to efficiently deploy
small cell infrastructure.
While we pursue licensed spectrum
for 5G, we must also be mindful of the
critical role that unlicensed spectrum
plays in the development of 5G and
throughout the communications land-
scape. Wi-Fi operating on unlicensed
spectrum is responsible for a tremen-
dous and growing amount of the data
transmitted in our homes and offices
and will play an increasing role in the
future.
Identifying spectrum resources, not
just for the next few years, but for the
next 10 years and beyond is essential if
we are to retain American leadership.
My MOBILE NOW Act was an impor-
tant step forward in increasing access
to both licensed and unlicensed spec-
trum, but there is more work to be
done. While we have made good
progress on securing low- and high-
band spectrum, China and South Korea
are far ahead of us in opening up mid-
band spectrum for 5G.
If we don’t want to lose out to China
and South Korea on 5G, we need to sub-
stantially increase the amount of mid-
band spectrum available to U.S. com-
panies. And, of course, we need to focus
on streamlining the deployment of
small cells through measures like the
STREAMLINE Act, so that companies
can get the necessary infrastructure
for 5G in place. The STREAMLINE Act
would substantially expedite the de-
ployment of 5G technology, and I hope
the Senate will take up my bill in the
near future.
Americans have always been
innovators and pioneers. We have been
on the cutting edge of more than one
technological revolution, and we can
lead the world again in 5G. I look for-
ward to continuing to work to ensure
that U.S. companies have the frame-
work they need to carry America into
the 5G future.

MAIDEN SPEECH
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I have
been a Member of this body for several
months now, and I would like to offer
a few observations about the experi-
ence.
I had been told that I might not like
it here. Having previously been a Gov-
ernor, some friends thought I might
find the pace a little too slow and deci-
sion making too diffuse and cum-
bersome, but that has not been the
case.
My committee assignments are inter-
esting and the work is important, and
while few bills actually become law,
the fact that both political parties
must reach consensus for a bill to pass
reinforces the ties that bind our Repub-
lic.
Given the public passion of our poli-
tics these days, I had also presumed
that the atmosphere here would vary
between prickly and hostile, but the
truth is that Senators on both sides of
the aisle are remarkably friendly and
collegial once the cameras are off.
I have now met privately with 68 of
my fellow Senators. Like them, I came
here in part because I believe my life
experience could help us confront our
national challenges. I also believe that
the values and policies practiced in
Utah can inform national debates. Our
State has the fastest job growth in the
country. It balances its budget every
year. It has the country’s most highly
educated workforce.
It is a great privilege to represent
the people of Utah in the Senate. I am
humbled by the history that has been
made here, by the character of the pa-
triots whose sculptures adorn our
halls, and, of course, by the great sac-
rifice made to construct the Capitol of
the greatest Nation on Earth. To serve
here is to be reminded daily of the his-
tory and greatness of this blessed coun-
try.
The American character has been dis-
tinct from our very beginning. Alexis
de Tocqueville observed that Ameri-
cans had fashioned a culture different
from any other he had encountered.
Just a few weeks ago, I attended the
150th anniversary of the completion of
the Transcontinental Railroad at
Promontory Summit in Utah. In his
keynote address, historian Jon
Meacham observed that, in a number of
ways, that endeavor revealed some of
the distinct elements of the national

character. President Abraham Lincoln
signed the project’s enabling legisla-
tion on the eve of the Civil War. The
country was divided as never before or
since, and the President was pre-
occupied with preserving the Union.
But despite the gathering storm, he
had both the foresight to see the im-
pact of a transcontinental railroad and
the confidence to believe it actually
could be constructed. We Americans
are drawn to visionary endeavors, and
we rarely lack the confidence needed to
undertake them.
It is difficult from today’s vantage
point to appreciate the extent of the
project’s engineering and construction
challenges. Some have even called it
the greatest engineering triumph of
the 19th century. Tunnels were blasted
through the Rocky Mountains and the
Sierra Nevada, at first only with black
powder. There were no hotels or res-
taurants along the way, no local
sources of energy or power tools. On
some days, the progress through Gran-
ite Mountain was measured in inches.
The cost was prohibitive, particu-
larly for a country preparing for a war,
so Congress made it a public-private
partnership. Two companies—one from
the West, another from the East—were
each granted tracks of land commensu-
rate with the amount of track they
laid. Fierce competition ensued, each
company wanting to obtain the most
land possible.
There were many who opposed the
idea of granting public land to private
companies that stood to make fortunes
on the lands they received. There were
others who thought the project was the
height of folly—too expensive, too dan-
gerous, and unnecessary. After all, it
was already possible to go from New
York to California in just 6 weeks by
land and 2 by sea. But having studied
and debated the matter, Lincoln and
Congress defied public criticism and
did what they believed was in the best
interest of the country.
The construction crews numbered in
the thousands. Fifteen thousand Chi-
nese immigrants worked for the Cen-
tral Railroad that began in Sac-
ramento, and roughly 7,000 Irish immi-
grants labored for the Union Pacific
Railroad coming from the East. In
time, veterans of the Civil War joined
the crews, as did several thousand Mor-
mons from Utah.
The work conditions were brutal.
Somewhere in the neighborhood of 500
to 1,000 men died. The achievement was
also marred by failures of character.
The promoters were oblivious to the
rights and needs of Native Americans
and to the plight of the immigrant
workers. When the railroad was com-
pleted, Chinese laborers were denied
citizenship. There can be a blindness in
the human mind that is clouded by am-
bition. Despite these unfavorable and
unpardonable failings, the Trans-
continental Railroad was a grand
achievement. It joined two great
oceans and overcame the challenge of a
nation spread across vast distances and
foreboding lands.
Intrinsic in the American mind is the
conviction that we can overcome any
challenge. In the years since then, we
have achieved greater marvels and
overcome greater challenges. Seventy-
five years ago, brave Americans landed
on the beaches in Normandy and began
the process of liberating a continent.
Americans turned the tide of two world
wars, overcame a global depression,
conquered deadly, debilitating disease,
and walked on the surface of the Moon.
We who have inherited this incom-
parably accomplished Nation might
wonder if we will face challenges as
daunting and opportunities as trans-
formational as theirs. The decisions
each generation of Americans makes
affect the course of history and pro-
foundly impact our prosperity and our
freedom. We face such decisions today.
Eight years ago, I argued that Russia
was our No. 1 geopolitical adversary.
Today, China is poised to assume that
distinction. Russia continues its ma-
lign effort, of course—violating trea-
ties, invading sovereign nations, pur-
suing nuclear superiority, interfering
in elections, spreading lies and hate,
protecting the world’s worse actors
from justice, and promoting
authoritarianism—but Russia is on a
declining path. Its population is
shrinking, and its industrial base is
lagging. John McCain famously opined
that Russia is a gas station parading as
a country. As it falls further behind,
we must expect Russia’s inevitable des-
peration to lead to further and more
aberrant conduct.
Unlike Russia, China is on a rising
path. When it was admitted to the
World Trade Organization, the expecta-
tion was that China would embrace the
rules of the global order, including
eventually respect for human rights. It
has done the opposite—imprisoning
millions in reeducation camps, bru-
tally repressing dissent, censoring the
media and internet, seizing land and
sea that don’t belong to it, and flouting
the global rules of free and fair com-
petition. Like Russia, China promotes
authoritarianism and protects brutal
dictators like Kim Jong Un and Nicolas
Maduro.
Today, we mark the anniversary of
the Tiananmen Square massacre. That
day, cries for freedom were brutally
crushed. Since then, China has pursued
a relentless course to smother the
kinds of hopes and dreams that filled
that square 30 years ago.
It is possible that China might some-
day experience a discontinuity or an-
other uprising that will change its
course. But barring that, because Chi-
na’s population is almost four times
our size, its economy should eventually
dwarf ours, and because economic ad-
vantage enables military advantage,
China’s military could even pass by
ours as well. It is possible that freedom
itself would be in jeopardy. If we fail to
act now, that possibility may become
reality.
I believe we have two imperatives:
First, strengthen ourselves and, sec-
ond, stop China’s predation.
In the long run, for a country like
ours, with a relatively small popu-
lation, to rival a country like China,
with its much larger population, we
must join our economic and military
might with that of other free nations.
Alliances are absolutely essential to
America’s security, to our future. I
can’t state that more plainly. Our alli-
ances are invaluable to us and to the
cause of freedom. We should strengthen
our alliances, not dismiss or begrudge
them. We should enhance our trade
with allies, not disrupt them, and co-
ordinate all the more closely our secu-
rity and our defense with them.
It is in the most vital interest of the
United States to see a strong NATO, a
strong Europe, stronger ties with the
free nations of Asia, the Pacific, the
subcontinent, and with every free
country. We need to hold our friends
closer, not neglect them or drive them
away. These alliances are a key advan-
tage we have over China. America has
many friends; China has very few.
We have another advantage: innova-
tion. The country that leads in innova-
tion will lead in prosperity. China
knows that as well as we do. After all,
China began its economic rise by steal-
ing our technologies. But today, China
has become an impressive innovator all
by itself. Last year, China received al-
most as many global patents as did the
United States. It is far ahead of us in
5G. It is on track to surpass us in arti-
ficial intelligence, and artificial intel-
ligence is a general purpose technology
that will have systemic impact on the
world.
It is critical that we protect our
technology and propel the innovation
we need in the future. Well resourced
and guided, our great research univer-
sities, combined with the productivity
inherent in free enterprise, are capable
of reasserting America’s innovation
leadership.
One dimension of American innova-
tion is often underestimated, however.
America is a magnet for the world’s
best and brightest. They want to come
here, not China. Over half of the 25
most valuable high-tech companies in
America were founded by immigrants
or by their children. It is very much in
our national interest to keep attract-
ing the world’s best minds to America.
We also need to tame our national
debt and deficit if we are to remain
strong. The Federal Government took
in about $3 trillion last year and spent
about $4 trillion. Adding a trillion dol-
lars every year to the debt means that
in 10 years, we would be spending al-
most as much on interest as we do on
our military. America won’t be strong
enough to defend its interests and lead-
ership if it strains under the burden of
crippling financial debt.
In addition to strengthening Amer-
ica, we must also confront China’s ag-
gression. China has focused its ambi-
tion most acutely on trade. Flouting
global rules and conventions, China has
corrupted the free market. China views
companies in countries that play by

the rules as the proverbial fish in a
barrel. Too often, we just ignore Chi-
na’s aggression, genuflecting before the
throne of free markets. But you don’t
have a free market if the biggest player
is allowed to cheat.
China’s cheating takes many forms.
For many years, it held down the value
of its currency to make its products ar-
tificially inexpensive, intending to
drive competitors from other countries
out of business. More recently, China
has debased its currency to partially
compensate for tariffs imposed on its
goods. Today, so-called industrial pol-
icy is China’s primary weapon of
choice. China subsidizes a company by
loaning it funds at submarket rates, by
forgiving loans, by providing free re-
search and development, or simply by
allowing it to use intellectual property
stolen from other nations.
Subsidy is even easier to hide when
the company is owned by the govern-
ment itself. There are 140,000 state-
owned enterprises in China, accounting
for 40 percent of its industrial assets.
Profitability, return on capital, and re-
payment of debt are mostly irrelevant
in such state-owned enterprises. They
can employ predatory pricing—enter-
ing a foreign market by pricing a prod-
uct well below its cost, driving domes-
tic competitors out of business. When
an American company does that, it is
prosecuted under antitrust laws, but
proving a Chinese product is priced
below cost is extremely difficult given
the lack of reliable cost data.
China’s industrial policies are killing
and debilitating businesses throughout
the world.
Look, I am a free market, free trade
guy, but free markets require rules to
enforce honest competition. Slavishly
accepting China’s cheating as a dy-
namic of a free market, competitive
workplace makes no sense at all. The
President is right to use tariffs to
crack down on China’s theft of intellec-
tual property, but when it comes to
China’s predatory industrial policy, the
cheating will not end. We need to
counter it directly.
Classically, a country has several
tools to counter a predatory compet-
itor. It can ban all or certain of its
products. We did this with the Soviets
during the Cold War. It can employ
counterbalancing subsidies. It can re-
quire high levels of local content. And,
of course, it can align with other na-
tions to establish strict rules of con-
duct, which it then vigorously and
swiftly enforces. All or some mix of
these is needed.
As we confront China’s aggression,
we must also endeavor to convince it
to turn back from the road of eco-
nomic, military, and geopolitical con-
flict upon which it has embarked. Join-
ing the other nations of the world in
genuinely fair and free trade and in re-
spect for the sovereignty of its trading
partners and neighbors is very much in
China’s, America’s, and the world’s in-
terest. China is not yet a geopolitical
foe, but its actions over the last sev-
eral years have brought it right up to
that line.
What I have said today won’t come as
a surprise to leaders here in Wash-
ington. The forms of China’s aggression
are widely understood by members of
the administration, Members of Con-
gress, and foreign affairs experts on
both sides of the aisle. But, to date, our
national response has largely been ad
hoc or short-term or piecemeal. It is
past time for us to conduct and con-
struct a comprehensive strategy to
meet the challenge of an ambitious and
increasingly hostile China.
I said at the outset of my remarks
that there are two dimensions needed
in a strategy to preserve American
leadership: First, strengthen America,
and second, confront China’s predation.
There is a third dimension. We must
alert the American people to the threat
we face and unite them to the greatest
extent possible in our response. In the
past, an act of war or blustering
threats by hostile actors have united
us. But don’t expect to see the Chinese
President pound his shoe on the
counter or shout that he is going to
bury us, as Nikita Khrushchev did long
ago. No, China intends to overcome us
just like the cook who kills the frog in
a pot of boiling water, smiling and ca-
joling as it slowly turns up the mili-
tary and economic heat.
The disappearance of traditional
media and the emergence of social
media have made it more difficult to
unite the country. Conspiring voices
online prey on the human tendency to
diminish the dignity and worth of peo-
ple of different views, of different
races, religions, or colors. Contempt
rather than empathy is a growing fea-
ture in our politics and media. Each of
us must make an effort to shut out the
voices of hate and fear, to ignore divi-
sive and alarming conspiracies, and to
be more respectful, more empathetic of
our fellow Americans. And when it
comes to cooling the rhetoric and en-
couraging unity, there is no more pow-
erful medium than the bully pulpit of
the President of the United States.
Bringing a nation of 330 million peo-
ple together in a shared effort is a
greater challenge these days than
bringing 2 coasts together with a rail-
road. But now, as then, national unity
demands that the voices of leaders
draw upon the better angels of our na-
ture. They must call upon the distinc-
tive qualities of our national character
evidenced time and again in American
history. We must reaffirm the prin-
ciples of the Declaration of Independ-
ence.
Jon Meacham said it well: The great-
est words ever originally written in
English may be these: ‘‘All Men are
created equal.’’ That founding convic-
tion propelled America to become the
greatest Nation on Earth. No people
have done more to assuage poverty, to
combat tyranny, or to advance the
God-given right of every woman and
man to be free. That is still our com-
mon cause, our enduring legacy, and
our promise to generations unborn.
Only America can lead that endeavor,
but only with honor, with integrity,
and with the combined strength of the
friends of freedom will we succeed.
America remains the best hope of
Earth and the champion of freedom.
May God bless us with the courage and
wisdom to keep that sacred trust.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this
Senate Chamber has had a lot of his-
toric debates. We have considered leg-
islation of great seriousness and his-
toric importance.
I have been on the floor of the Senate
when we voted on going to war. I can’t
think of a more serious responsibility
that a Member of the Senate might
have. You know that even at the end of
a good day, innocent people are going
to die, and you have to cast a vote as
to whether America should make that
decision.
I have been here when we passed leg-
islation that really was transformative
in terms of the future of this country.
After we went through the great reces-
sion in 2008, President Obama stepped
up and said that we have to do some-
thing about reforming Wall Street, and
we did. We spent months in committee
hearings and brought to the floor a bill
that is characterized as Dodd-Frank to
change Wall Street and to make sure
we never went through that kind of
economic crisis again.
I was here when we considered the
Affordable Care Act 10 years ago. That
debate went on for over a year, amend-
ment after amendment, change after
change. We were addressing an issue
that affected virtually every single
American family, if not directly, then
indirectly.
Those are the types of things that
have been debated on the floor of this
Chamber. But look at it now. It is
empty. It is so underutilized that for
hours and hours each business day, we
come to the floor to make little
speeches. At best, we are going to have
a vote or two on another nomination
from the Republican side, usually a
controversial nomination, and that is
it. That is it.
When you think of all of the possi-
bilities of what we could do in the U.S.
Senate Chamber for the good of this
country, it seems like a terrible waste
of space and a terrible waste of time.
Men and women who made great per-
sonal sacrifices to run for the U.S. Sen-
ate and who serve in this Chamber find
themselves in an empty Chamber, by
and large, with nothing going on.
If you want to see some action,
switch your C–SPAN channel over to

June 4, 2019
Chamber, with a Democratic majority,
they are actually legislating. That is
right. On Capitol Hill, one of the
branches of Congress is actually pass-
ing legislation. Students ought to see
it so that they know what it looks like.
Don’t look here because we don’t do
that anymore. We don’t spend our time
dealing with legislation in the U.S.
Senate—only with lifetime appoint-
ments to the Federal bench that Sen-
ator MCCONNELL and the Federalist So-
ciety approve.
Let me give you an example of some-
thing that happened in the House, an
opportunity for the Senate. It is about
the Affordable Care Act.
The Affordable Care Act passed under
President Obama 10 years ago. It really
changed the way we sold health insur-
ance in America. Before the Affordable
Care Act, health insurance companies
could, and often did, use people’s med-
ical history to deny coverage or to
charge premiums they couldn’t afford
to pay for.
What type of preexisting condition
caused people to be rendered essen-
tially uninsurable before the Afford-
able Care Act? Asthma, diabetes, aller-
gies, high blood pressure, arthritis, a
history of cancer, or even being a
woman—that was considered a pre-
existing condition. It raised your pre-
miums and maybe even denied you cov-
erage.
More than 133 million Americans out
of some 360 million in this country
have a preexisting condition. Five mil-
lion of them are from my home State
of Illinois. I bet even more are from the
State of Florida.
Before the Affordable Care Act, in-
surance companies used to use that
medical history against individuals
and families. The Affordable Care Act
said, enough of that discrimination
against people who have preexisting
medical conditions. That bill, that law,
prohibited insurance companies from
denying coverage to people with pre-
existing conditions or from trying to
charge them higher premiums because
of it.
For the past 2 years, President Don-
ald Trump has had a single focus on
eliminating the Affordable Care Act
and the protections I just described. He
has attempted in every way possible to
eliminate protection for 133 million
Americans with preexisting conditions.
He even brought it to the floor of the
U.S. Senate early in his Presidency.
I will never forget that night. It was
early in the morning, and it was a see-
saw vote back and forth as to whether
we were going to repeal the Affordable
Care Act. The Republicans, who had
been decrying this for 10 years,
couldn’t wait to repeal it, but they had
nothing to replace it with. So at 2:30 in
the morning, through that door walked
a man whom I consider a national hero,
a Member of the U.S. Senate named
John McCain. John McCain walked
through that door, stood in that well,
and as he could barely move his arm,
having had his arms broken as a pris-
oner of war, said no. His ‘‘no’’ vote,
with that thumb going down, changed
history. It kept the Affordable Care
Act alive. President Trump failed, and
he has never forgiven that great hero
John McCain for stepping up for the
good of this country and voting no
against the repeal of the Affordable
Care Act.
The President did not quit with that
legislative effort. He decided he would
try to kill the Affordable Care Act and
the protection for people with pre-
existing conditions. He would do it in
court if he couldn’t do it in the Senate.
President Trump’s Department of
Justice recently weighed in on a Texas
court case and argued that the Afford-
able Care Act should be abolished. If
that happened, of course, discrimina-
tion based on preexisting conditions
would once again be legal in America.
In July, the court will hear the ap-
peal of this case. If President Trump
has his way, Americans will lose this
protection if they have preexisting con-
ditions. It is just that simple.
Last month, the House of Represent-
atives, not too far away from where I
am standing, decided to do something.
They decided to legislate. Unlike the
Senate, they understand that the
House of Congress can actually pass a
bill that might become a law. So they
had a debate, and they had a vote. On
a bipartisan basis, the House of Rep-
resentatives, last month, passed the
Protecting Americans with Preexisting
Conditions Act. This bill would prevent
President Trump or any President from
once again allowing health insurance
companies to discriminate against peo-
ple with preexisting conditions. It
would affect 5 million people in my
State with preexisting conditions and
their families.
Let me tell you about one of them.
Her name is Cathy. She is from one of
our suburban towns outside of Chi-
cago—not the town, really—the big
city of Naperville. She wrote me about
her kids, especially her oldest child
who has diabetes and the other three
children in her house who have cystic
fibrosis. Cathy wrote: ‘‘As a con-
stituent and someone personally af-
fected by cystic fibrosis, I’m asking
you to please protect access to quality,
specialized care for people with pre-ex-
isting conditions.’’
Think about what that mom has been
through with those three kids—diabe-
tes for the oldest and cystic fibrosis for
three of her children. Can you imagine
the sleepless nights, the heartache, and
the worry she and her family have been
through because of those kids? Any
family who has ever had a sick kid
knows it is a special pain, and Cathy
has had it over and over and over
again.
Cathy, I have to say this: The House
of Representatives is here to help you.
Sadly, the Senate is not. Under Major-
ity Leader MITCH MCCONNELL, Repub-
lican leader from Kentucky, the Senate
is exclusively considering partisan,
controversial, lifetime appointments to
the Federal courts and virtually noth-
ing else—nothing else. The Senate
should be voting on bills that improve
people’s lives. The Senate could pass
the bill already passed by the House,
and I could send Cathy of Naperville a
message: We hear you. We want to help
you and your kids. We don’t want you
to ever have to worry about health in-
surance in the future because the kids
were born with these medical condi-
tions.
There are other things we could do.
How about this for a radical idea?
Overwhelmingly, the American people,
Republicans and Democrats, say: Con-
gress, would you do something about
the cost of prescription drugs?
What have we done on the floor so far
when it comes to the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs in the Senate? Nothing.
Every single day, if you own a tele-
vision, you get to see night ads by pre-
scription drug companies, and some of
them you could repeat right back to
them. ‘‘If you are allergic to Xarelto,
don’t take Xarelto.’’ How would I fig-
ure that out? Do you know the most
heavily advertised drug? It is Humira.
It is for an arthritic condition, but it
also treats psoriasis. I am learning all
of this because I see these ads over and
over and over again. Do you have any
idea how much Humira costs? AbbVie,
the company that makes it, tells you
$5,500 a month. Now, if you are crippled
with arthritis, maybe that is what you
need and want to do. If you have a red
spot on your elbow from psoriasis,
probably not.
So I have a bill that says: Disclose
the price of drugs on your ads. It is not
a radical idea, and it is a price that the
drug manufacturers themselves pub-
licize. We are not making it up. Put it
on your ad. It is one step but only one
step forward. There are so many things
we could do to deal with the high cost
of prescription drugs that we are not
doing on the floor of the U.S. Senate.
Instead, this empty Chamber is for
Members of the Senate to come and
give speeches and maybe look
longingly across the Rotunda at the
House of Representatives, which is ac-
tually legislating. What if we decided
to do something about prescription
drug prices? I think America would be
in shock to think that the Senate actu-
ally is legislating.
We just had another tragedy in Vir-
ginia Beach, another mass shooting.
Twelve innocent people were killed and
several others seriously wounded. We
don’t know how that will end, but it is
already a gross tragedy. It has been re-
peated over and over and over in vir-
tually every one of our States.
Could we take the time on the floor
of the Senate to make sure people with
a felony conviction record do not buy
guns in America? That is not too much
to ask, is it? Closing that gun show
loophole and keeping guns out of the
hands of people who misuse them, we
could be doing that on the floor of the
Senate but not with Senator MCCON-
NELL’s agenda. It doesn’t fit. He doesn’t
have time.

S3178 June 4, 2019
We could also be reauthorizing the
Violence Against Women’s Act. It is a
bill that used to pass so easily. Demo-
crats and Republicans agree that we
are against violence involving women.
We are not reauthorizing it. We are not
even considering it on the floor of the
Senate.
The Senate would be a great place to
legislate. It would almost sound like
the movie or look like the movie, ‘‘Mr.
Smith Goes to Washington,’’ where
people come to the floor of the Senate,
elect Senators, debate issues, vote on
amendments, have rollcalls, make
speeches, appeal to the American peo-
ple, and try to put the majority votes
together. Wouldn’t it be a wonderful
return to those thrilling days of yester-
year when the Senate legislated?
But Senator MCCONNELL doesn’t have
time, no time this year for legislation.
Maybe next year. If he is in charge,
maybe never. I urge Leader MCCONNELL
and my Republican colleagues, let’s get
back to work. Let’s earn our pay-
checks. Let’s use this Chamber for the
purpose for which it was built. Let’s
actually debate a measure. Don’t be
afraid to vote, my colleagues in the
Senate. I have done it several thousand
times. It is not that painful. I have
constituents who expect nothing less of
us, to see the Senate at work actually
legislating on matters that are mean-
ingful. They realize the Senate has be-
come an empty Chamber, a legislative
graveyard. I am ready to go to work.
Perhaps a few Republican Senators will
join the Democrats in actually doing
that.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
PRESIDENTIAL POWERS
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I
rise to address a matter that I believe
should alarm every Member of this
Senate, regardless of party, and that is
the President’s and the executive
branch’s increasing use of declared
emergency powers to seize powers that
are not lawfully theirs to take.
Just in the last week, we have seen
two examples of this. We saw an ad-
ministration claim emergency author-
ity to move forward with an arms sale
to Saudi Arabia and others. Last week,
we also saw the President claim emer-
gency powers in order to threaten an
escalating set of tariffs on the country
of Mexico.
Earlier this year, the President
claimed emergency powers to divert
funds away from important military
and national security priorities to fund
part of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico
border. There was a headline, May 10,
2019, ‘‘Pentagon Shifts $1.5 Billion to
Border Wall From Afghan War Budget
and Other Military Projects.’’
I, personally, oppose the outcomes
the President is seeking in each of
these emergency declarations. I oppose
selling weapons to Saudi Arabia under
the current circumstances. I oppose
putting huge tariffs on Mexico that
will harm American consumers and
American businesses. I oppose divert-
ing moneys from the Defense Depart-
ment to spend on a wasteful, ineffec-
tive wall along the entire U.S. border.
Those are my views with respect to
these outcomes. I suggest that all of
us, Republicans and Democrats alike,
should focus not only on the outcomes
of each of these emergency declara-
tions but the means the President is
using to achieve them because, in each
case, the President is claiming emer-
gency powers to justify these actions.
If this Senate stands by and allows
that to happen, we will be surrendering
our coequal powers as a separate
branch of government and, in the proc-
ess, undermining the integrity of our
democracy itself. We should not leave
this to the courts. We should not say,
well, we don’t think the President
should be able to declare these emer-
gency powers, but we are not going to
deal with it here in the Senate; we are
going to leave that to the third branch
of government. That will undermine
our democracy and this institution.
Whether you like the outcomes or dis-
like the outcomes, the claim of emer-
gency power to achieve these goals es-
tablishes a terrible precedent for our
democracy, and we cannot sit idly by
and allow that claim to continue un-
checked.
I want to start by reviewing the
Trump administration’s invocation of
so-called emergency powers to sell
weapons to Saudi Arabia and others.
The President’s desire to please the
Saudi regime and promote the Crown
Prince’s reckless conduct apparently
knows no limits. It is a bottomless pit.
We all recall President Trump vetoed a
resolution that passed both Chambers
of Congress with bipartisan support to
end U.S. military support for the disas-
trous war in Yemen. When his own CIA
Director concluded that the Crown
Prince of Saudi Arabia was complicit
in the murder of U.S. resident and jour-
nalist Jamal Khashoggi, the President
refused to hold the Crown Prince ac-
countable. Instead, he ran to his de-
fense saying that ‘‘it could very well be
that the Crown Prince had knowledge
of this tragic event—maybe he did and
maybe he didn’t!’’
That was the President’s attitude, go
ahead and murder a resident of the
United States, go ahead and murder a
columnist for a major U.S. paper. It
doesn’t really matter.
The administration went on to flout
the law by refusing to provide a deter-
mination to Congress on whether the
Saudi Crown Prince was responsible for
the murder of Khashoggi. Despite the
fact that Saudi leaders have openly
talked about acquiring a nuclear weap-
on, the President is singularly deter-
mined to conclude a nuclear coopera-
tion agreement with the Saudis, at-
tempting to dodge oversight and ac-
countability at every turn.
That was just the prelude to what the
President did last week when Congress
was in its work period. The President
invoked a so-called emergency author-
ity to sell precision-guided munitions
and other arms to Saudi Arabia, the
UAE, and others. Why? It is pretty ob-
vious. He knew that arms sale would be
challenged by Congress, and it would
be very likely that Congress would not
approve that sale.
What happened? Here are the facts.
Under the law, the administration
must submit a formal notification to
Congress of a proposed arms sale, if it
is large enough. After the sale is noti-
fied, Congress has a short window in
which we can act to block the sale. We
would do that by introducing and pass-
ing a joint resolution of disapproval
through the House and the Senate. The
President knew the Congress was not
going to support that sale and that we
would likely vote to block it. What did
he do? Instead of trying persuasion, in-
stead of going through the constitu-
tional process, the legal process, he de-
cided to fake an emergency because
under the law, the President can by-
pass congressional review if he states
that ‘‘an emergency exists,’’ which re-
quires the sale to be made immediately
‘‘in the national security interests of
the United States.’’
By making that declaration, the
President was able to commit an end-
run against Congress, and we should
not allow it to happen because it is
abuse of power and, I believe, an abuse
of the law.
That emergency authority has only
been used a handful of times in the last
few decades. In fact, the last President
to invoke it was President George H.
W. Bush following the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait. Let’s be clear. There is no
emergency here, and the President is
invoking it under false pretenses sim-
ply to hand another favor to the Saudi
Crown Prince.
Where are these bombs and muni-
tions going to end up? The war in
Yemen and the Saudi-led coalition’s
war against the Houthis in Yemen has
raged for 5 years now, costing the lives
of more than 100,000 civilians. Millions
are on the brink of starvation. The
United Nations has declared Yemen the
world’s largest humanitarian catas-
trophe. Where are we 5 years into this
war? The Houthis are more entrenched
and militarily sophisticated. Iranian
influence in the region has expanded.
In short, the Trump administration’s
strategy has been totally counter-
productive. Instead of prioritizing a
diplomatic solution of the conflict, the
President is fueling the fire and perpet-
uating a humanitarian crisis.
What was the claimed emergency
here, the emergency the President in-
voked to try to bypass the Congress

and sell these weapons to Saudi Ara-
bia? The administration cites in its
documents, in its notice, Iranian ma-
lign activity in the region. The admin-
istration claims that the ‘‘rapidly-
evolving security situation in the re-
gion requires an accelerated delivery of
certain capabilities to U.S. partners in
the region.’’
We all know that Iran is a malign
actor in the region. This is nothing
new. It has kept the Assad regime in
Syria alive. It supports the Hezbollah
in Lebanon, the Houthi rebels in
Yemen, and a constellation of Shia mi-
litia groups in Iraq—all of which have
contributed to instability in the region
for a very long time.
The administration has not explained
why all of a sudden this ongoing ma-
lign activity justifies an emergency
declaration to circumvent this body in
the House of Representatives, nor has
it shown how the delivery of these
weapons is going to provide some kind
of an immediate benefit to either the
United States or our allies.
What we really have is, this adminis-
tration has, under the direction of Na-
tional Security Advisor John Bolton,
in a calculated effort, dramatically in-
creased tensions with Iran to a point
where we could easily have a mis-
calculation that leads to war.
This administration has ripped up
the nuclear agreement, choked off
Iran’s oil exports, and, against the ad-
vice of America’s military leadership,
designated the Islamic Revolutionary
Guard a terrorist organization while
accelerating the movement of Amer-
ican ships and bombers into the Per-
sian Gulf.
Maybe most troubling is that even
when given multiple opportunities,
Secretary of State Pompeo, has refused
to acknowledge that the 2001 author-
ization to use military force, AUMF,
would not justify the administration
taking military action against Iran.
The administration’s failure to make
that very clear shows the need and ur-
gency for us to act in these areas. In
fact, what we know from our intel-
ligence communities, cited in public
reports, there is zero evidence that
Iran and al-Qaida have carried out any
joint operations against the United
States. In fact, to the contrary, ISIS,
which we know is an al-Qaida descend-
ant in Syria and Iraq, took credit for a
2017 attack on Iran’s Parliament build-
ing and tomb of the Islamic Republic’s
founder, the Ayatollah Khomeini,
which according to Iran’s state media
killed at least 12 people.
Anyone who knows anything about
the history in this region knows that
while Iran is a malign actor, they have
been an enemy of al-Qaida and an
enemy of ISIS—Iran, of course, being a
majority Shia country and ISIS and al-
Qaida being extreme elements of a
Sunni ideology.
As we sit here and watch the Presi-
dent invoking these emergency powers
to undermine the separation of powers,
we are not doing our job so we need to
begin to take action. Yet what the
President is learning from our inaction
is the ability to continue down this
road of claiming emergency powers to
take further measures.
As I said just last week, we also saw
the President invoke emergency pow-
ers to put in place a mechanism to dra-
matically increase tariffs on Mexico
over a period of time. That, of course,
would be incredibly costly to American
consumers, costly to American busi-
nesses, but it is also incredibly costly
to our system of government and sepa-
ration of powers, where article I clear-
ly gives this Congress power in the
area of setting trade policy. Yet where
are we? We are AWOL, totally AWOL
when it comes to standing up for the
Constitution. We are allowing this
President to, time after time, claim
emergency powers to accomplish cer-
tain goals. Some may justify it by say-
ing: OK. I agree with the outcome in
that particular use of emergency pow-
ers.
This pattern of conduct is going to
set a very dangerous precedent. While
some of my colleagues may like some
of these outcomes today, you have an-
other President in the White House
who starts claiming emergency powers
left and right, and all of a sudden, I can
assure you, my colleagues will take a
different view. This is the moment
when people need to come together and
stand up for the Constitution and do
our jobs as a separate branch of gov-
ernment. We can’t contract this all out
to the courts to make these determina-
tions. Of course, earlier in the year, the
President claimed emergency powers
to divert moneys from important na-
tional security efforts, including the
effort in Afghanistan and to build the
wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Again, I suggest, don’t be lured into
going along with this process simply
because you like the outcome. We can
disagree about whether it is smart and
cost-effective to build a wall along the
U.S.-Mexico border, but we should not
disagree that it is an abuse of power to
continue to manufacture or claim
emergency authorities to override the
will of Congress.
This is an important moment, espe-
cially as we consider the fact that Sec-
retary Pompeo has not clearly indi-
cated that the 2001 AUMF does not give
this administration or any administra-
tion the power to use military action
against Iran.
If we don’t start standing up and
doing our job, we will be undermining
important constitutional principles
that the Founders put in place to pre-
vent an Executive from running wild
over the legislative process. So I hope,
as the Republicans and the Democrats
see the President invoke these emer-
gency powers of whether to sell arms
to Saudi Arabia, to increase tariffs on
Mexico, or to build a wall, we recognize
that we are going down a very, very
slippery slope and that we have a con-
stitutional obligation to protect our
democracy and the principles outlined
in the Constitution.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued
NOMINATIONS
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this
week, the Senate will consider another
batch of well-qualified nominees. These
are men and women who have chosen
to serve the American people in a vari-
ety of ways throughout the Federal
Government, and we owe it to them to
get them off the Senate calendar and
on the job.
Among the nominees we are consid-
ering this week is Susan Combs, who,
as the Presiding Officer knows, is a fel-
low Texan who has been nominated to
serve as the Assistant Secretary for
Policy, Management and Budget at the
Department of the Interior. Susan has
led an impressive career in both the
public and private sectors and has
served our State as a member of the
Texas House of Representatives, then
as the first female agriculture commis-
sioner, and, later, as the Texas comp-
troller of public accounts.
In each job, she gained the respect of
virtually everyone she worked with.
So, for those who know Susan, her
nomination has come as no surprise.
What is surprising, though, is how long
it has taken her to reach this point and
be confirmed. She was nominated in
July of 2017. Within 1 month, she testi-
fied before the Committee on Energy
and Natural Resources, and she re-
ceived unanimous support. Suffice it to
say, her nomination was not controver-
sial. So why has it taken 2 years for
her to get a vote on the Senate floor?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3180 June 4, 2019
Unfortunately, our colleagues across
the aisle have pulled every trick in the
book to slow down the nominations
process, not because they have objected
to a particular nominee or because a
nominee has been unqualified, but be-
cause it has been part of a broader ef-
fort to stymie the President and this
administration and bring the work of
this body to a crawl.
With each day that has passed since
the President has been inaugurated,
the growing backlog of nominations
has allowed hundreds of important po-
sitions throughout the Federal Govern-
ment to have remained vacant. That is
not fair to the people who have been
nominated; that is not fair to the ad-
ministration; and it is particularly not
fair to the American people, whom
these individuals are to serve.
A couple of months ago, we passed a
modest rules change that broke the
logjam, at least to some extent, and al-
lowed us to finally begin to make some
much needed progress. In the, roughly,
3 months prior to the rules change, we
were able to confirm only 23 nominees.
In the, roughly, 2 months since, we
have more than doubled that number.
We have begun to fill dozens of posi-
tions, including those of Federal
judges, ambassadorships, and sub-Cabi-
net officials at various Departments
and Agencies. Two weeks ago, we con-
firmed the 41st circuit court judge
since President Trump took office, and
we are making progress on filling more
judicial vacancies.
As we approach the 2-year anniver-
sary of Susan Combs’ nomination hav-
ing been sent to the Senate, I am glad
we can finally vote on her confirmation
and continue our work to confirm well-
qualified nominees.
HEALTHCARE
Mr. President, on another matter, we
continue to hear cries from the left
about Medicare for All—the one-size-
fits-all healthcare plan they continue
to embrace.
It is ironic, in having been in this
Chamber during the battle over the Af-
fordable Care Act and when President
Obama famously said ‘‘If you like your
policy, you can keep it,’’ that now, ap-
parently, the Democrats have aban-
doned that promise. Instead, their
promise is, if you like your employer-
provided health insurance policy, you
can’t keep it.
The fact is that this plan would drain
the vital program that our seniors have
relied on for more than a half a cen-
tury and would force all Americans to
participate in a watered-down version,
which, clearly, would not be financially
sustainable. More than 180 million
Americans would be kicked off of their
private insurance plans and be forced
onto a government-run plan. This
strikes me as a solution in search of a
problem.
Don’t get me wrong. Our healthcare
system isn’t perfect, and there are
things we need to do to make it better,
but they don’t want to pay higher
taxes and be put on the same
healthcare plan as every other Amer-
ican. They want to be able to choose
their coverage at prices that work best
for them and their families, and, yes,
we need to improve our healthcare sys-
tem so it focuses on patients and al-
lows all individuals and families to
choose what works best for them. For-
tunately, Senate Republicans have
been working hard to create legislation
that would do exactly that.
Earlier this year, I cosponsored the
Protect Act, which is being led by our
colleague from North Carolina, Senator
TILLIS. This bill would make sure that
no one would be denied coverage or
would be forced to pay a higher pre-
mium because of one’s having a pre-
existing condition. With the future of
ObamaCare hanging in the balance, we
need to provide peace of mind for the
millions of Americans who have pre-
existing conditions and who worry
about the uncertainty of their
healthcare.
This legislation would also prohibit
discrimination against patients based
on their health status. That includes
denying coverage, limiting what treat-
ments are covered, or increasing pre-
miums because of one’s having a pre-
existing condition. This is an impor-
tant step we can and should take to af-
firm that all Americans deserve access
to affordable care at affordable prices.
In addition, by codifying the associa-
tion health plans, we can help self-em-
ployed individuals and small business
employees who don’t receive employer-
provided coverage.
Association health plans were ini-
tially established by the Department of
Labor. They allow businesses in the
same region or industry to come to-
gether and purchase insurance. These
plans have proven to be a great solu-
tion for small businesses across the
country that represent a host of small
businesses and sole proprietors because
they are afforded the opportunity of
getting, essentially, the same quality
of coverage provided by large employ-
ers but at the same lower prices that
people pay who are in these large em-
ployer-provided plans.
Historically, the problem has been in
the individual market, which is where
most of these individuals would find
themselves, in that the pool of risks is
not sufficiently broad. Because of per-
verse incentives, they would actually
end up paying much higher premiums
than other people who would be simi-
larly situated who would have em-
ployer-provided plans.
Association health plans address that
directly by providing a larger pool of
insured individuals, which would help
to bring down the premiums and help
to bring down the deductibles over
what they are currently under the Af-
fordable Care Act. Several chambers in
Texas are using these association
health plans for their members, and I
would like to be able to provide more
flexibility for AHPs so that more
Americans may take advantage of this
employer-provided insurance.
In codifying this Labor Department
rule and making insurance more af-
fordable and accessible, we must also
look at healthcare costs beyond the
premiums people pay for their health
insurance. That is why we need to take
a look at out-of-pocket costs for pre-
scription drugs. When it comes to
drugs that have just come on the mar-
ket after lengthy research and develop-
ment, you would expect the prices to
be higher. That is the price we pay for
the innovation and lifesaving new
drugs. Companies patent their drugs to
ensure that the money spent during
the research and development phases
can be recovered once the drugs hit
pharmacy shelves.
These patents—a form of individual
property protection—are important in
order to encourage innovation. Unfor-
tunately, on occasion, we see compa-
nies that abuse this system and try to
get new patents on existing drugs in
order to prolong their exclusivity and,
of course, to maintain the high profits
they get on a patented drug. This type
of behavior is not what Congress in-
tended. We cannot allow bad actors to
game the system in order to turn high-
er profits and prevent more Americans
from getting access to these drugs at
lower prices, which is what the system
is designed to do once they go off pat-
ent.
Recently, I introduced the Affordable
Prescriptions for Patients Act, which
encourages competition within the
pharmaceutical industry by stopping
these sorts of corrupt practices. The
bill would define product hopping and
patent thickets—two practices used by
some manufacturers—as anticompeti-
tive behavior. Certainly, this doesn’t
prevent manufacturers from making
improvements in their products. It
doesn’t limit patent rights, and it
doesn’t hamper innovation. Yet it does
stop those who knowingly abuse the
patent system by allowing the Federal
Trade Commission to bring antitrust
suits against the bad actors.
In addition to these bills, I recently
introduced a bill to protect the integ-
rity of the Medicare part D system.
This is the prescription drug system
that Congress created years ago, which
actually provides seniors with access
to prescription drugs at a modest cost.
Currently, part D’s sponsors may vol-
untarily report fraud data to the CMS,
but they are not required to report the
specific number of instances of fraud,
waste, and abuse they identify or the
actions they take to correct these
problems. This bill would implement
recommendations made by the Health
and Human Services Office of Inspector
General to require plan sponsors to re-
port fraud and improve oversight of
this important program.
These are the types of reforms we
need. We don’t need Medicare for All,
which will force 180 million people off
of their private health insurance and
bankrupt the Medicare system that we
pledged to be there to provide access to
healthcare for our seniors once they

qualify. These are the types of reforms
we need instead. Overhauling our en-
tire healthcare system to put everyone
on the same subpar plan would not help
anyone.
The way I see it is we have two op-
tions. One option is Medicare for All,
which forces everyone onto the same
plan. The government tells you what
clinic to go to, what doctor to see,
what brand of prescription you can get
access to. You lose the power to make
decisions about your own healthcare,
and you simply have to take what you
get on somebody else’s timeframe.
That is Medicare for All. It would si-
multaneously ruin Medicare by forcing
all 330 million Americans onto the
same plan, which will bring down the
quality of care for our seniors, who
have paid over the years into the plan,
and which will bankrupt our country in
the process.
I think there is a better choice, a bet-
ter option. Rather than the govern-
ment’s telling you what you have to
do, let’s make smart, targeted reforms
that allow patients to determine the
coverage and care they want at more
affordable prices. I believe we can im-
plement these reforms in a way that
will bring down costs without reducing
choice.
We can continue to protect Ameri-
cans with preexisting conditions, which
is something we all agree should be
done. We can lower the costs of pre-
scriptions and out-of-pocket costs and
stop the bad actors who game the sys-
tem. We can provide the States with
more flexibility to allow for more cov-
erage options so that families can pick
the plans that are right for them. Yes,
we can also encourage innovation so
our country will remain at the fore-
front of medical solutions and innova-
tion.
Those are two words you don’t ordi-
narily see—‘‘government-run’’ plan and
‘‘innovation’’—in the same sentence.
As a matter of fact, they are polar op-
posites.
Finally, we need to preserve Medi-
care for our seniors who have paid into
this over their lifetime.
I appreciate my colleagues who are
hard at work to make these kinds of
reforms a reality. And I have heard
from my constituents loud and clear.
When it comes to healthcare, they
want more choices, more affordability,
not the one-size-fits-all that Medicare
for All would provide.
I yield the floor.

75TH ANNIVERSARY OF D-DAY
Mr. LANKFORD. I rise to remind the
Senate of two anniversaries that are
happening this week. This week is the
75th anniversary of the invasion of
Normandy. It is commonly known as
D-Day. One hundred sixty-thousand-
plus individuals crossed the English
Channel by aircraft, by boat. They
moved in every way possible, starting
in the middle of the night and with the
major invasion that was the largest
naval invasion in the history of the
world. They would have crossed into
France—what was the beginning of the
end of Nazi Germany.
The loss of lives of Americans and Al-
lied forces was catastrophic as they
pushed in. The boys, 18, 19, 20 years old,
got on aircraft, got on ships, launched
out into the water, knowing there was
a tyrant on the other side who had to
be stopped. It is entirely appropriate
for the Nation to pause to remember D-
Day, to know the freedom we have
right now was protected by a genera-
tion that stood for that freedom. As
the Nation looks toward Normandy a
couple days from now, I think we
should once again thank the ‘‘greatest
generation’’ that guarded our freedom.
100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT
Mr. President, today is also a 100-
year anniversary, though. One hundred
years ago today, June 4, 1919, the Sen-
ate voted to pass the right for women
to vote. As a son of a pretty amazing
mom and as the husband of a really re-
markable lady and as the dad of two
daughters who are both voters now—
they cannot thank the ladies enough
who started in the 1800s working to-
ward a basic human dignity and right;
that is, the right for people to vote. It
is astounding to us as a nation to think
that it took that long, all the way up
until 1919, to have a vote in the Senate
to allow women to vote. That vote—
with 36 Republicans and 20 Democrats
that day who voted on June 4, 1919—
changed the direction of how we would
vote and how we would cooperate to-
gether as a nation.
Now, we have a lot of other areas to
fix, but that one was a big one, and my
family is grateful for what was done in
the past. People who come through the
Rotunda of the Capitol often see a stat-
ue there that looks like it is not fin-
ished. It is a block of stone, and there
are three ladies who are carved out of
it, but a part of it is not carved. I often
hear people say they don’t understand
that statue. That statue is Elizabeth
Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and
Lucretia Mott, the three ladies who led
the movement of ladies all over the
country to just speak out and say la-
dies should have the right to vote.
Those three ladies are carved into
stone that is in our Rotunda, but what
is interesting is, the statue is unfin-
ished because the assumption was in
the days ahead, there would be more
ladies in the future who would step out
and would lead a nation to make sure
that we allow the rights of every single
individual to be honored.
So, for the sake of my mom and my
aunt, my grandmother, my wife, my
daughters, and millions of ladies, we
cannot thank those ladies enough for
standing up for what was right at that
time period. I think it is appropriate
that we pause for just a moment in the
Senate and remember June 4, 1919, 100
years later, and thank those ladies for
standing up for the rights of ladies in
their generation and the ladies in the
generations to come.
I yield the floor.

ator from Montana.
JOB CORPS
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, every-
where I go in Montana, I hear the same
thing from my State’s business owners
and job creators of the State; that they
need more workers. They need more
highly skilled welders, bricklayers,
heavy machine operators, and laborers.
The list goes on and on. I will tell you
that I think the biggest limiting factor
to moving our economy forward is a
well-trained workforce. These busi-
nesses give living-wage jobs to the
folks who are able to fill them, if they
have the skills to fill them.
That is why I was so appalled when
the Trump administration recklessly
and cluelessly moved to close so many
successful Job Corps programs across
this country.
While we have heard there is some
sort of reprieve for the Anaconda Job
Corps, we have not received word that
actually means it is going to stay open
or any of the other Job Corps across
this country—16 of which were sched-
uled for privatization and 9 of which
were out-and-out closures—will stay
open.
In Montana’s case, we have two suc-
cessful Civilian Conservation Corps
programs: the Anaconda Job Corps and
the Trapper Creek Job Corps. The Ana-
conda Job Corps, of course, is in Ana-
conda, MT. The Trapper Creek Job
Corps is in Darby. These two job train-
ing centers play an active role in our
State’s economy.
We have a foundry in Butte, MT. It is
called Montana Precision Products.
Mike Robbins is a co-owner of that.
This company has hired more than 50
Job Corps graduates in recent years
alone—more than 50—most of whom, if
not all, were from the Anaconda Job
Corps. He has promoted these folks—
some of them—from entry level to mid-
level managers.
So when Mike and his brother Burt
need high-skilled employees, the first
place they look is the Job Corps. Why?
Because these folks come out with a
skill set that fits their needs.
Now, you may ask: Who is going into
the Job Corps? These are at-risk folks.
These are folks who are having a hard
time with life and a hard time getting
a job, and they go in the Job Corps—
young people—and they give them a
skill, a skill they can use in the private
sector, a skill that if the Trump admin-
istration has their way, they will no
longer be able to receive.

They will be at risk. They will not be
well trained. They will, in fact, prob-
ably end up in some sort of government
program instead of contributing to our
economy, and this is what the Job
Corps allows them to do.
(Mr. LANKFORD assumed the Chair.)
Needless to say, they also provide in-
credible work in our forests, fighting
fires, helping clean up our forests.
It is just amazing to me—it is amaz-
ing the shortsightedness of this deci-
sion to privatize 16 and close 9 Job
Corps across the country. We have
heard from one of its graduates—I have
heard from many of its graduates, by
the way—of the Job Corps in Anaconda
and down in Darby at Trapper Creek.
One of the graduates is named Zoey
Huff. Zoey told me the Job Corps saved
her life—changed it. Before her time in
the Job Corps, Zoey lived with her par-
ents. She wasn’t sure what direction
she wanted to take in her life. She
went through the Job Corps, and now
she has a CDL, which is a commercial
driver’s license. She has that and cer-
tificates that make her an employee
who is valued and someone whom busi-
nesses across this country—because I
don’t think Montana is any exception—
are competing against each other to
hire.
The Job Corps gave her the training
and the life tools she needs to succeed,
but Zoey’s story is not unique. My of-
fice has been flooded with stories like
hers. I encourage folks who have been
impacted by the Job Corps to share
their story on my website.
I recently heard from Carl in Mon-
tana. Carl’s father enrolled in the Job
Corps nearly 50 years ago. That 1-year
investment in Carl’s father provided
him with a career that has lasted him
for 45 years, that allowed him to raise
5 children and help support 11 grand-
children. It was a good investment be-
cause 4-year colleges are great, but
they are not for everybody. There are
some folks who would rather work with
their hands than sit at a desk. These
are the folks who shower after work,
not before work, and I can relate to
these folks. Without important re-
sources like the Job Corps, we are
making it harder and harder for young
people in rural areas to access the job
training they need to succeed in this
21st century economy.
If the President tries again to close
the Job Corps, not only will it imme-
diately reduce the amount of well-
trained workers in rural America, but
it will also kill dozens of good-paying
jobs in these small communities that
don’t support the Job Corps. It is a
double punch in the gut that our rural
counties have not felt in a long, long
time—decades.
Once they are closed, by the way—
the one in Anaconda has been open
since 1966—once they are closed, it will
be hard to get them back.
So when I received the news about
the Job Corps 10 days ago, I urged Sec-
retary Perdue, the Secretary of Agri-
culture, and Labor Secretary Alex
Acosta to reverse course.
Senator BOOZMAN is on board to help
reverse this shortsighted and irrespon-
sible decision. I am proud to work with
him and Senator MERKLEY on this issue
and appreciate his work to protect Job
Corps in rural America, but we can’t do
this alone. That is why I, along with
Senator BOOZMAN, am introducing bi-
partisan legislation that will reverse
the administration’s action to close
Job Corps not only in Montana but
across this country. I am going to con-
tinue to fight until we get a firm prom-
ise from this administration that these
Job Corps centers are going to be
around for years to come. We will be
introducing legislation to block clo-
sures and prevent these critical em-
ployment centers from being subject to
the whim of a President who doesn’t
know what is going on in rural Amer-
ica.
My bill will prohibit the use of appro-
priated funds in fiscal year 2019 and
2020 to close any Civilian Conservation
Centers. It will also prohibit any Agen-
cy Secretaries from changing the inter-
agency agreement that facilitates the
operation of Civilian Conservation Cen-
ters, thus preventing the privatization
of these programs.
Look, the administration’s decision
to close these, whether it is in Mon-
tana or Arkansas or any other place,
will negatively impact those States in
the whole country. So it is my hope—
it is my hope that this administration
will open their eyes and see what is
really going on in this country be-
cause, quite frankly, Job Corps has
worked for decades and decades and
decades. It has produced people who are
valuable assets to the business commu-
nity and who raised families and helped
support our economy and are part of
the fabric of this great country. Yet
this administration, through their goal
to making American great again, has
forgotten about things that make
America great and have made America
great.
So whether it is businesses like Mike
Robbins’ and Burt Robbins’ business or
whether it is students who go through
this program, like Zoey, we need every-
body in this Chamber—everybody,
Democrats and Republicans alike be-
cause we are smarter than that—to
make sure we have Job Corps around
for our next generation and genera-
tions after.
I yield the floor.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I
come to the floor today, on June 4, to
take a look back at a very historic
vote by the U.S. Senate. This vote
changed the course of political history
in America. It strengthened the social
fabric and constitutional framework of
our Republic.
One hundred years ago today, law-
makers in this body cast a vote for lib-
erty and equality under the law. The
Senate approved Federal suffrage legis-
lation. At the time it was passed, it
was known as the Susan B. Anthony
amendment. Today it is better known
as the 19th Amendment to our U.S.
Constitution.
Section 1 of the 19th Amendment
reads: ‘‘The right of the citizens of the
United States to vote shall not be de-
nied or abridged by the United States
or by any State on account of sex.’’
By adopting the measure, the 66th
U.S. Congress paved the way for wom-
en’s suffrage from sea to shining sea.
At the time, more than a dozen States
and Territories allowed full suffrage,
led by the Western States of Wyoming,
Colorado, Utah, and Idaho.
In 1919 both Chambers of Congress
were led by Republican majorities. The
House of Representatives adopted this
constitutional amendment 304 to 89 on
May 21. Two weeks later the Repub-
lican Senate voted 56 to 25 in favor of
women suffrage. That was two votes
more than the necessary two-thirds
vote required under our Constitution.
Both U.S. Senators from my State of
Iowa voted for passage. Senator Wil-
liam Kenyon, then the junior Senator
from Iowa, later went on to serve as a
Federal judge for the Eighth Circuit.
The other aye vote from Iowa was
cast by my predecessor, meaning he
was the only other Senator from Iowa
to serve in the position I now serve in
as President pro tempore of the U.S.
Senate. That senior Republican Sen-
ator from Iowa was a former Governor
of Iowa, Albert Baird Cummins.
To a full Gallery packed with suffra-
gists, Senator Cummins, as President
pro tempore, announced final passage
of the suffrage amendment. It was re-
ported on June 5 in the New York
Times that Iowa Senator Cummins,
presiding over the U.S. Senate, allowed
visitors in the Gallery to celebrate
with ‘‘deafening applause,’’ and he
made no effort to stop the celebration.
As President pro tempore, Senator
Cummins from Iowa was present at the
enrollment ceremony, watching over
the shoulder of Vice President Thomas
Marshall, who signed this historic bill.
After the Senate passed it, it was
then sent to the States for ratification.
In a special session of the Iowa General
Assembly, my State became the tenth
State to ratify the 19th amendment on
July 2, 1919, less than a month after the
U.S. Senate had approved it.
Suffragists and supporters continued
the campaign they started in the
Hawkeye State prior to World War I.
They mobilized support among farmers
to pave the way to the ballot box for
women. The future Secretary of Agri-
culture under President Harding cham-
pioned women’s rights to vote in his
widely circulated farm journal. Henry
C. Wallace of Des Moines wrote:
I do not know how we can have a govern-
ment of the people, for the people and by the
people, until women have an equal voice
with men. They are fully as competent as
men to use that ballot wisely.
Now, others invoked the patriotism,
service, and sacrifice of women during

World War I. Another compelling argu-
ment reminded Americans that, with-
out the ballot, women suffered tax-
ation without representation. All
Americans will recall that the battle
cry of taxation without representation
also paved the way to America’s road
to independence from Great Britain,
declared in July of 1776.
Two days after Iowa ratified the 19th
amendment, Americans celebrated our
Nation’s 143rd year of independence on
the Fourth of July. One hundred years
later, we are 1 month away from cele-
brating our Nation’s 243rd year of inde-
pendence. Wow, what a difference a
century can make.
The historic passage of the 19th
amendment pulled back the curtain to
the voting booth and cracked open the
glass ceiling for women to serve in pub-
lic office. Today one-fourth of the U.S.
Senate are women, including my col-
league from Iowa, Senator JONI ERNST.
She is also the first female combat vet-
eran elected to serve in the U.S. Sen-
ate.
In the 116th Congress, 102 women are
now serving in the House of Represent-
atives, including two women from
Iowa, Representative ABBY FINKENAUER
and CINDY AXNE.
In the last election, Iowans elected
our first female Governor, Kim Rey-
nolds, one of nine women now serving
as chief executive of their respective
States.
Today I pay tribute to all those who
blazed the trail to the ballot box and
helped secure women’s right to vote.
At long last, the sacred right of fran-
chise became a reality for all Ameri-
cans. It had been sought by women
since the American Revolution.
Through the decades, it gained momen-
tum through relentless advocacy at the
grassroots.
A lot of credit is due to organizers of
a convention called the Seneca Falls
Convention in New York State in the
summer of 1848. Just think how long
that was before the 19th amendment
was finally adopted. In 1848 this con-
vention lit a flame that became inex-
tinguishable. They launched a civic
movement for the ages with enough ox-
ygen to become a grassroots prairie
fire.
For more than half a century, this
organization of mostly women orga-
nized with petitions, parades, and pro-
tests, building momentum and con-
stituencies at the State and Federal
level. These early suffragists succeeded
in laying a cornerstone of equality for
generations to come. One of the most
fundamental rights of self-government
is the right to vote, and ratification of
the 19th amendment enshrined their
sacred civic duty into our founding
charter of freedom.
I often say that the ballot box holds
elected Members of Congress to ac-
count for the decisions we make on be-
half of those we represent. Our institu-
tions of government, civic organiza-
tions, system of free enterprise, places
of work, schools, communities, and,
most importantly, families are strong-
er thanks to the suffragists of our his-
tory.
The road to ratification came down
to a tie-breaking vote in Nashville, TN.
A young member of the State legisla-
ture broke a deadlocked vote that oth-
erwise would have tabled the measure.
His name was Harry Burn, a 24-year-old
Republican from East Tennessee.
The morning of the vote, he received
a note from his mother. She invoked
the name of a famous suffragist with
long ties to my home State of Iowa.
You hear it along with Susan B. An-
thony, but not as often. The name of
that Iowa woman is Carrie Chapman
Catt. If you want to visit her historic
farm home, you can go to Charles City,
IA, and visit where she grew up and
lived.
Mrs. Burns, the mother of that young
Tennessee State legislator, implored
her son to ‘‘be a good boy and help Mrs.
Catt put the ‘rat’ in ratification.’’
Representative Burns credited his
tie-breaking vote to the influence of
his mother, to justice, and for the leg-
acy of the Republican Party. In a
statement explaining his vote, Rep-
resentative Burn wrote:
I appreciated the fact that an opportunity
such as seldom comes to a mortal man to
free seventeen million women from political
slavery was mine. . . . I desired that my
party in both State and nation might say
that it was a republican from the East moun-
tains of Tennessee . . . who made national
woman suffrage possible. . . .
On August 18, 1920, the Volunteer
State became the 36th State to ratify
the amendment, securing the three-
fourths of the States required under
the U.S. Constitution.
When the U.S. Secretary of State cer-
tified the results 8 days later, the 19th
amendment became the law of the
land. It ensured men and women in
America would share equal rights to
this fundamental civic right.
Like Harry Burn, I have a personal
story about my mother. My mother in-
fluenced my interest in government.
For as long as I can remember, she
sowed the seeds of my quest for public
office and a commitment to public
service.
For years, she taught students in a
one-room schoolhouse about the three
R’s—reading, writing, and arithmetic—
as well as lifelong lessons of civic re-
sponsibility. At home, she taught the
Grassley kids around the kitchen table
to stand up for our beliefs. Those
teachings were to choose right over
wrong, to waste not, want not, and to
value hard work and the value of hard-
earned money. She practiced what she
preached, putting honesty and integ-
rity first and foremost.
This photo I have beside me today
was published in the Des Moines Reg-
ister on August 30, 1920. Approximately
8 or 10 days after Tennessee ratified it
but only 1 day after the secretary of
State of the State of Iowa said women
could now vote, we have this photo of
my mother voting. It sets the scene of
a historic day near my family farm.
A local woman named Mrs. Jens G.
Theusen, of Fairfield Township, located
in Grundy County, IA—I live just
across the county line in Butler Coun-
ty—submitted her ballot in a country
school in what I think was a school
election.
She was one of the first women to
vote after the newly ratified 19th
Amendment.
My own mother, Ruth Corwin Grass-
ley—referred to here as Mrs. L. A.
Grassley, after Louis Arthur Grassley,
my dad—also cast a history-making
vote that day in a local election.
This picture says this is my mother
here, but this is my mother right here.
So the Des Moines Register was wrong
in identifying this person, when this
person is my mother. The Waterloo
Courier got it right that this was Ruth
Grassley, but instead of with two s’s,
the Waterloo Courier spelled it with
one s.
The Waterloo Times Tribune was
present at this vote and reported that
‘‘Black Hawk and Grundy County
women gained fame Friday by being
the first in the state and probably the
first in the nation to take advantage of
the privilege of equal suffrage.’’ That is
from the Waterloo paper.
You would think that I would have
known about this while my mother was
living. I didn’t know anything about it.
I have since learned that this photo
was widely distributed in newspapers
across the country, illustrating the
historic victory of women’s suffrage.
This election in Iowa was held just 29
hours after the official announcement
of the ratification of the 19th Amend-
ment.
This photo of my mother also immor-
talized her vote for posterity. She did
so without any fanfare. She never
bragged about anything, including her
history-making vote in the local elec-
tion. In fact, it wasn’t until after she
had passed away by maybe 20 years
that I learned that my mother, Ruth
Grassley, was one of the very first
women in Iowa to cast her vote.
While I was growing up, I didn’t real-
ize what a trailblazer she was from the
standpoint of women’s suffrage. I knew
she was a trailblazer in many other
ways. Many suffragists wore their mis-
sion as a badge of honor for all to see.
With 50 years of fighting to get it, I
sure don’t blame them for doing that.
Others, like my mother, were equally
as proud to carry out their newfound
right and civic duty in anonymity. I
am not surprised I never knew this
story about my mother. My mother
cast her vote to make her voice count,
perhaps not even realizing she was
making history at that moment.
Today, at this moment, I stand here
as an Iowa farm boy, a proud son of a
very early voter in Iowa—one of the
first four, according to the Des Moines
Register—and a U.S. Senator from
Iowa because I want to share her story
on the centennial anniversary marking
Senate passage of the 19th Amendment.

principles of limited government, free
enterprise, and personal responsibility
in our Constitution. Let us also pay
tribute, then, to our founding mothers
who fought and who secured these
cherished blessings of freedom and lib-
erty for their daughters and grand-
daughters yet to come in the same doc-
ument. Today, we remember their leg-
acy. Let’s respect their legacy.
A century after the Senate voted in
favor of the 19th Amendment—on this
very day 100 years ago—I encourage all
Americans to treasure their right to
vote. The suffragists of yesterday
helped shape the course of history to
ensure all Americans today and for
sure in the future will carry the torch
of freedom, liberty, justice, and oppor-
tunity for all for generations to come.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan.
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President,
first, I want to congratulate the senior
Senator from Iowa and say what a won-
derful story that is about his mom.
And to see a picture like that—it is
such an inspiring story. He certainly
has a lot to be proud of in many, many
ways.
I say to the Senator, now I know
more about you, knowing that you had
such a smart and strong mom. That
tells me a lot. Thank you for sharing
that.
I rise with two short topics today.
First, I, too, want to commemorate the
100th anniversary of the passage of the
19th Amendment granting women the
right to vote. Even more so, I rise
today to celebrate the brave and deter-
mined women who fought so hard and
for so long for our right to make our
voices heard.
I remember coming into the U.S.
Senate in 2000 and finding out that it
wasn’t until 2001—the first year I was
here—that we actually had enough
women in the Senate to have one
woman on every committee, a woman’s
voice on every committee. It is incred-
ible, actually, that it took until 2001.
But this was an important milestone at
the time, as together we have been able
to achieve many different milestones
for women’s voices, and we see that
continuing to happen.
I want to speak specifically about
Catharine Fish Stebbins, a woman
from Detroit who was one of those
women who fought so hard at the very
beginning and on whose shoulders we
really stand. She may not have been as
well known, but she was a suffragist
and an abolitionist. She signed the
Declaration of Sentiments at the first
women’s rights convention in Seneca
Falls in 1848.
One of the resolutions in that docu-
ment said: ‘‘It is the duty of the women
of this country to secure to themselves
their sacred right to elective fran-
chise,’’ and she took that very seri-
ously.
In 1871, accompanied by her husband,
Catharine tried to register to vote. She
was told no. She tried again, this time
accompanied by a friend who lived in
another ward. That friend, Nannette B.
Gardner, argued that she was a widow
and a taxpayer and that she should be
allowed to register. But Catharine was
once again told no.
In 1872, she tried to register again.
This time, she was told no, but she did
get election officials to admit that, in
their words, ‘‘Mrs. Stebbins would have
all the required qualification of an
elector, but for the fact of her being a
woman.’’
Catharine never did get to cast a bal-
lot before she died in 1904. Yet I believe
she would be extremely proud of how
far we have come as a country and how
far we have come in Michigan.
Last November, Michigan elected a
woman Governor—our second woman
to be elected Governor—a woman sec-
retary of state, a woman attorney gen-
eral, reelected a woman to the U.S.
Senate, and elected three new women
Members of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. It was extraordinary.
That is progress, but in my mind, the
real progress was that being women
wasn’t the story. We didn’t win because
of the novelty of having all of these
women running for statewide office. We
didn’t win thanks to some ‘‘pink wave’’
that was talked about in the press. We
didn’t win because we focused on
‘‘women’s issues’’ because, as we know,
every issue is a woman’s issue. Instead,
each of us won because we were strong
and qualified candidates who earned
our nominations and ran forward-look-
ing and positive campaigns focused on
issues important to Michigan families.
Everyone was judged on their own.
People weren’t talking about our gen-
der and whether it was OK to have
women in all of these top positions; in-
stead, they were talking about our
qualifications and who was the best
candidate. To me, that is truly his-
toric.
There is no question we still have a
long way to go. Women now make a
quarter of this Chamber. We are one
out of four—a historic high. I think
Catharine would agree with me that it
should be at least 50 percent. That
would be a good goal. I think we are
maybe 54 percent of the voting popu-
lation; that is good too.
On this 100th anniversary of women’s
right to vote, I am celebrating how far
we have come and the women, like
Catharine, who worked so very hard to
get us here. Even more important, I
think we all should recommit ourselves
to the fight to move forward.
REMEMBERING THAD COCHRAN
Madam President, I would like to
take one more minute to talk about a
dear friend of mine who is no longer
with us, who had a funeral yesterday
and one today in Mississippi. I want to
pay tribute to someone I was honored
to call my friend, and I know that
many other Members on both sides of
the aisle feel exactly the same way.
Thad Cochran was the senior Senator
from Mississippi, but he was so much
more. He was a wonderful musician. I
have some very happy memories of
joining him to play the boogie-woogie
on the piano that was in his office.
People couldn’t believe that he actu-
ally not only had a piano, but he had a
grand piano in his office. As someone
who grew up in music, we immediately
bonded over that, as two people who
loved to play the piano.
He was a true gentleman. If he gave
you his word, you knew for a fact that
he would keep it. His honesty and in-
tegrity made him a joy to work with
on the farm bill, as well as on so many
other issues.
He was deeply devoted to public serv-
ice, particularly fighting for his farm-
ers, for cotton farmers and others in
the delta, protecting the waters of the
Mississippi Delta, and caring for Mis-
sissippi’s children. As author of the
Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthoriza-
tion Act of 2004, he helped provide
healthy food for children and families
from Biloxi to Battle Creek and every-
where in between.
Senator Cochran was a legislative
legend in Mississippi, and he never
stopped fighting for his beloved Mag-
nolia State. He loved Mississippi, and I
can tell you that Mississippi loved him
right back. I had a chance to see this
lifelong love affair up close when I vis-
ited Mississippi with Senator Cochran
back in 2013. At the time, I was chair of
the Agriculture Committee, and Sen-
ator Cochran was the ranking member.
We were right in the middle of working
on the farm bill, and I was invited to
speak at the annual meeting of the
Delta Council, which has been working
to promote economic development in
Northwest Mississippi since 1935.
I can tell you that you couldn’t find
a better Mississippian tour guide than
Senator Cochran. I got to see the delta
up close and listen to him talk about
the waters, the conservation programs
he was such a champion for, and the
people who depend on them, in that
soft drawl of his. Listening to him was
like listening to poetry.
Senator Cochran certainly wasn’t
going to bring me all the way to Mis-
sissippi without stopping by a few holy
sites of that American form of music
called the blues. We visited the iconic
Po’ Monkey’s Lounge in Merigold—one
of the last rural juke joints in the
State—and met its operator, a local
farmer named Willie Seaberry. We also
stopped by Clarksdale Crossroads,
home of the Delta Blues Museum and
the very spot where blues legend Rob-
ert Johnson said he sold his soul to the
devil in exchange for songwriting suc-
cess.
I will never forget the picnic by the
Mississippi River that he and others
hosted for me. If you have never been
to a good old-fashioned Mississippi
cookout, then I suggest you book a
ticket right now. The only thing there
was more of than food was southern
hospitality. I might have been the
token Yankee, but I was welcomed as
one of their own.
At every stop along the way, Senator
Cochran was just beaming with pride.

He couldn’t have been more proud of
his State, and they were always so
proud of him.
At first glance, you might think we
didn’t have a lot in common. I am a
northerner, and he was a southerner.
We were from different political parties
and different generations, but we both
loved the blues and loved to play the
piano. We were both passionate about
agriculture and protecting the waters
in our States, and we both deeply be-
lieved in bridging differences and work-
ing together to keep our country mov-
ing forward.
In his final speech on the Senate
floor, Senator Cochran said this:
We have engaged in heated arguments. But
even in full disagreement, I believe all our
motivations begin at the same point: the sin-
cere desire to serve our States and country.
Senator Cochran was always able to
see the good in others, and I firmly be-
lieve that the Senate and our country
would be a kinder, better place if more
of us would follow his lead.
Senator Cochran was, above all, a
statesman, and he was my friend. For
that, I will always be grateful. I want
to offer his family and friends and the
entire State of Mississippi my deepest
condolences.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I
come to the floor today as part of our
national celebration of the 100th anni-
versary of U.S. women’s suffrage.
Now, 100 years ago today, on June 4,
1919, Congress passed the 19th Amend-
ment to the Constitution giving women
the right to vote. This hard-fought leg-
islative victory would ensure women’s
full participation in our democracy.
On August 18 of 1920, women’s suf-
frage became U.S. law. Now, some of
the people watching may not know
that Wyoming was actually more than
50 years ahead of the Nation when it
came to women voting. That is a fact.
This year, people back home in Wyo-
ming are celebrating both the 100th an-
niversary of the U.S. women’s right to
vote and the 150th anniversary of Wyo-
ming women’s right to vote. Wyoming
truly is the Nation’s trailblazer when
it comes to women’s equality.
Many people think of Wyoming as
the Cowboy State, and that name hon-
ors our State’s great western heritage,
but Wyoming is also known as the
Equality State—the first State in the
Nation to grant women the right to
vote, long before statehood, actually,
because, on December 10, 1869, the Wyo-
ming territory passed the first law in
the United States granting women the
right to vote and to hold public office.
The law meant full civil and judicial
equality with men.
The following year, on September 6,
1870, Louisa Ann Swain, of Laramie,
WY, became the first woman in the
United States—in the history of the en-
tire country—to vote in a general elec-
tion.
Twenty years later, Wyoming re-
affirmed its commitment to women’s
rights as we sought statehood. Wyo-
ming, categorically, refused to enter
the Union without the right for women
to vote. When standing on principle be-
came a major sticking point, Wyoming
stuck to its guns on women’s equality.
In fact, retaining women’s right to
vote was so essential that Charles
Burritt, of Johnson County, a delegate
to the Wyoming Constitutional Con-
vention, famously declared: ‘‘If we can-
not come into the union of states with
a platform of right, why then we will
stay out and willingly remain in a ter-
ritorial form of government until all of
us have passed away to the grave.’’
That is how important this issue was
to the people of my home State of Wyo-
ming.
In Congress, Joseph Carey was here
as a Wyoming delegate to the U.S.
House of Representatives. He presented
the case for statehood in the House of
Representatives. He emphasized the
strong values of the people of Wyo-
ming, values that included political
parity between men and women. Mem-
bers of Congress opposed to women’s
suffrage meanwhile argued strongly
against Wyoming becoming a State.
One Representative opposed to state-
hood even remarked—and I will quote
him from the RECORD of the House of
Representatives. He said: ‘‘Mr. Speak-
er, I do not hesitate to say that in my
judgment the franchise has been too
liberally extended.’’ It is a Member of
the House of Representatives arguing
against allowing Wyoming to become a
State.
Well, Wyoming, of course, won the
debate narrowly. On March 26, 1890, the
U.S. House of Representatives nar-
rowly passed the Wyoming statehood
bill by a vote of 139 to 127. The measure
passed the Senate a few months later,
and then on July 10, 1890—that is the
day we became a State—President Ben-
jamin Harrison signed Wyoming’s
statehood into law, naming the 44th
State the ‘‘Equality State’’—not the
‘‘Cowboy State,’’ not a ‘‘Western
State’’ but the ‘‘Equality State.’’ Let
me just say that my State may have
been the 44th State to enter the Union,
but Wyoming will always be the first
when it comes to women’s rights.
Wyoming has declared 2019 as ‘‘The
Year of Wyoming Women,’’ and on De-
cember 10 of this year, Wyoming will
celebrate Wyoming’s Women’s Suffrage
Day. It is a time to pay tribute to Wyo-
ming’s many women trailblazers, such
as Nellie Tayloe Ross, who was Wyo-
ming’s 14th Governor and the first
elected woman Governor in the United
States.
Governor Nellie Tayloe Ross com-
pleted the term of her late husband,
Governor William Ross, who had died
suddenly in office. She showed great
courage and resolve by then running
for election—and she did this against
the advice of close family and friends—
and she won. On January 5, 1925, Nellie
Tayloe Ross became the first U.S.
woman to be sworn in as Governor,
serving with distinction until 1927. She
didn’t stop there. Nellie Ross went on
to become the first female Director of
the United States Mint, serving five
terms here in Washington from 1933 to
1953. She died in 1977 at the age of 101.
I want to recognize another Wyoming
trailblazer today—educator Estelle
Reel. Estelle Reel was the first woman
elected to Wyoming’s statewide office
as the superintendent of public instruc-
tion. Only 1 year later, in 1895, she be-
came the first woman confirmed by the
U.S. Senate to a Federal position, the
Superintendent of Indian Schools.
There are a few more Wyoming
women firsts whom I would like to
mention.
On March 7, 1870, Esther Hobart Mor-
ris was the first woman to serve on a
jury. That jury was in Laramie, WY.
She was also the first female justice of
the peace, appointed on February 17,
1870.
In 1870, Wyoming’s Mary Atkinson
became our country’s first female
court bailiff.
Wyoming was also home to the first
all-woman city government, elected in
1920 in Jackson, WY, and they are
shown here in this photograph as Wyo-
ming’s trailblazing women. The Jack-
son Press dubbed them ‘‘the petticoat
government.’’
Clearly, the people of Wyoming and
all Americans owe an incredible debt of
gratitude to the Nation’s extraordinary
women leaders, past and present, so
this year, we celebrate those first laws
that gave women the right to vote and
ensured their full participation in our
democracy.
Thank you, Madam President.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama.
Mr. JONES. Madam President, before
I get into my initial remarks, let me
commend my colleague, the Senator
from Wyoming. I didn’t know about all
of the Wyoming women having been
first in women’s issues. I congratulate
that State, and I hope that, given the
record number of women we have in
this body and in the Congress of the
United States, we will continue that
march toward progress that Wyoming
started over 150 years ago.

tornadoes that have touched down all
over the country, including most re-
cently in my home State of Alabama. I
am not even talking about Hurricane
Michael, which hit Alabama’s
Wiregrass and wiped out entire fields of
crops. We all agree those have been
tragic and deadly natural disasters, but
the disaster I want to talk about for a
few moments today is the self-imposed
disaster that was created by this U.S.
Government that has taken place in
the wake of these storms and natural
disasters.
President Trump and certain Mem-
bers of Congress on both sides of the
aisle have managed to take what has
traditionally been a bipartisan process
and turn it into a political mess. It
began last December when the Presi-
dent decided to insist on funding for
some type of wall along our southern
border. That demand resulted in the
longest government shutdown in our
Nation’s history. It also set off a series
of delays for badly needed disaster re-
lief. Only after the President dropped
his demand for wall funding could the
government once again open and re-
sume full operations.
After the government reopened and
disaster relief was proposed in this new
Congress, the President was locked
into a political dispute with leaders in
Puerto Rico and refused to provide the
necessary aid to those American citi-
zens—American citizens—and yet an-
other stalemate thus began. As that
stalemate dragged on, the President
once again injected the issue of border
security and immigration into the un-
related discussions regarding disaster
relief. Finally, after a delay of several
months that saw the occurrence of ad-
ditional weather-related disasters, the
President, just as he had done with the
most recent government shutdown in
January, resumed his political de-
mands and signaled he would sign a
clean bill that included only disaster
relief.
That bill passed the Senate a couple
of weeks ago by unanimous consent.
Unfortunately, it did not pass the
House last week because of three indi-
viduals who refused to let it pass the
House also with unanimous agreement.
It was only after the President with-
drew his demands that the bill got to
the Senate floor with enough support
to garner the necessary votes to pass.
What was interesting about the bill
that passed by unanimous consent in
the Senate a couple of weeks ago and
passed the House of Representatives
just last night was the ‘‘lo and behold’’
moment as Republicans voted for the
bill last night. A month ago, they had
voted against an almost identical bill
in order to please the President. They
obediently switched their votes to aye
when the President signaled his sup-
port.
Folks, I think it is somewhat shame-
ful to play politics with people’s lives
the way we have done in this Congress
over the last few months—to play poli-
tics with people’s lives and their liveli-
hoods, especially when the political
issues that were holding things up had
really nothing to do with the impor-
tant issues at hand.
You can see it here. This photograph
shows what happened in the Wiregrass
area of Alabama just last fall as a re-
sult of Hurricane Michael. On the left
side of this graphic is the ‘‘before’’ pic-
ture. We had a record cotton crop that
was ready to be harvested, and every-
one was excited about the bumper crop
we had. Hurricane Michael came
through, and, with no pun intended, it
was just gone with the wind—literally
wiped out. That was last fall.
Then it was in March that the tor-
nado season once again hit Alabama.
This is one photograph, but I can show
you many of the devastating effects of
the tornado that touched down in Lee
County in March, killing 23 people. I
myself visited there with the first re-
sponders to comfort those who had lost
loved ones and had lost everything.
What you cannot see in this picture
is the littered countryside of Lee Coun-
ty, littered with not only the splin-
tered trees but with people’s lives—
their homes, their belongings, their
mobile homes that were scattered
throughout the entire area. All was
lost in that area and in Beauregard and
in Smith Station. Yet these folks
couldn’t get the disaster relief they
needed in a timely manner because it
was being held up by the President and
Congress. These folks had been through
so much already, and the fact that we
put them through so many months of
uncertainty while they were waiting
for help from their elected representa-
tives is really unconscionable.
Now that this bill has passed—and I
am assuming that as soon as the Presi-
dent comes back, he will sign it, as he
signaled he would—I want to thank my
senior colleague from Alabama, Sen-
ator SHELBY, and Senator LEAHY for
their leadership in getting this bill
across the finish line. I want to also
say a special word of thanks to my
neighbors from Georgia, Senator ISAK-
SON and Senator PERDUE, who worked
tirelessly—so hard—to make this bi-
partisan deal such that the President
would sign it.
Although it took far too long, I am
certainly grateful that farmers and
Americans across the country who
have suffered from these disasters, ex-
perienced them firsthand, can finally
breathe a sigh of relief today because
of the disaster relief bill that has fi-
nally been passed.

75TH ANNIVERSARY OF D-DAY
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, 75
years ago tomorrow, June 5, 1944, Gen-
eral Dwight D. Eisenhower gave a
speech to U.S. soldiers the day before
the invasion of Normandy.
In that speech, he said this:
Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen of the Allied
Expeditionary Force!
You are about to embark upon the Great
Crusade, toward which we have striven these
many months. The eyes of the world are
upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-
loving people everywhere march with you. In
company with our brave Allies and brothers-
in-arms on other Fronts, you will bring
about the destruction of the German war
machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny
over the oppressed peoples of Europe, and se-
curity for ourselves in a free world.
He ended his comments by saying:
I have full confidence in your courage, de-
votion to duty and skill in battle. We will ac-
cept nothing less than full Victory!
Good luck! And let us all beseech the bless-
ing of Almighty God upon this great and
noble undertaking.
It was an undertaking not just re-
markable for its logistical effort and
massive supply planning but for what
it meant to humanity: a mobilization
in the name of freedom to stand
against evil and a massive undertaking
uncertain of outcome to fight oppres-
sion for a free world.
I hope every American will take
some time this week to reflect on that
massive undertaking 75 years ago that
ultimately led to the liberation of Eu-
rope, the destruction of Adolf Hitler,
and the end of World War II and to re-
flect on the sacrifice and courage, the
selfless acts of bravery, and the stories
of families who never saw a loved one
return.
The decision to move forward with
the invasion was reached in late 1943.
By May of 1944, nearly 3 million Allied
troops were amassed in southern Eng-
land. Gathered along with the millions
of soldiers was the largest armada in
world history, with over 4,000 ships
from Canada, the United States, and
Great Britain. There were 11,000 air-
planes that participated in the inva-
sion, pounding the shores and Nazi po-
sitions, and delivering supplies and
thousands of troops up and down the
coast of France.
The assault began shortly after mid-
night on June 6, 1944, with Allied
bombers attacking targets along the
coast and inland. More than 24,000
American, British, and Canadian air-
borne assault troops and 1,200 aircraft
followed the air bombardment. At 1:30
a.m., the 101st Airborne Division began
landing behind Utah Beach, and the
82nd Airborne Division began landing
at 2:30 a.m. The second phase on the
coast began at 5:30 a.m. when six Allied
divisions and numerous small units
began landing on five beaches. In total,
the Allies landed more than 160,000
troops at Normandy—73,000 American,
along with 83,115 British and Canadian
forces—on Gold, Juno, and Sword
Beaches.
By the end of the first day, Allied

the world from tyranny, and their av-

I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, one of the things I have noticed
over the years that I have given these
climate speeches is that corporate en-
gagement on climate change has been
one-sided, let’s just say. It is clear who
my adversaries have been—Big Oil, the
coal lobby, the Koch brothers, and
some very powerful corporate trade as-
sociations—the American Petroleum
Institute, the National Association of
Manufacturers, and the most powerful
of all, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
so-called. In my view, it is more prop-
erly called the U.S. Chamber of Carbon.
These adversaries have managed a big-
money campaign, first, to sow doubt
about or outright deny climate change
and, second, to block action in Con-
gress and Federal agencies to limit car-
bon pollution.
The International Monetary Fund
just estimated fossil fuel subsidies in
the United States at $650 billion for
2015. Yes, that is ‘‘billion’’ with a ‘‘b.’’
When you are defending that kind of
subsidy, you spare no expense, which
explains the millions of dollars spent
by the fossil fuel industry and its trade
group cronies in opposing climate bills,
in supporting phony climate denial
front groups, and in funding election
attacks against candidates who might
try to limit carbon pollution.
While the fossil fuel industry has
been running roughshod around Wash-
ington, the rest of corporate America
has sat on its hands. Even companies
with gauzy website offerings on cli-
mate and strong sustainability policies
within the company have done vir-
tually nothing to support climate ac-
tion in Congress. I could name names,
but that would make it a very long
speech because, basically, everybody in
corporate America has been absent
here.
There are, at long last, signs that
corporate America is waking up to the
climate fight it has been losing in
Washington. When and if corporate
America finally engages in the serious
support of climate action, Congress
will, once again, spring to life. After a
10-year drought, we could again see bi-
partisan legislation to reduce carbon
pollution.
Why this new spurt of corporate en-
gagement on climate change?
Look at the avalanche of warnings
about the financial risks climate
change poses to the global economy. In
just the last few months, here are some
of the warnings: 34 central banks, in-
cluding Canada’s, France’s, and Eng-
land’s; a group of major reinsurers; the
Federal Reserve Bank of San Fran-
cisco; the investment giant BlackRock;
EPA economists and scientists; the
Urban Land Institute; the investment
advisory firm Mercer; the European
Central Bank; and the investment advi-
sory firm Sarasin & Partners. All have
separately warned about climate
change’s tanking the economy.
There are agricultural as well as fi-
nancial warnings. In April, the big food
companies—Danone, Mars, Nestle, and
Unilever—announced that they would
begin advocating for Federal action on
climate change. They see the risk cli-
mate change poses to the world’s agri-
cultural and water supplies.
Their preferred solution? A price on
carbon:
Establish an ambitious carbon pricing sys-
tem that sends a clear signal to the market-
place to reduce economy-wide greenhouse
gas emissions aligned with the Paris Agree-
ment goal to keep global temperature in-
crease well below 2-degrees centigrade. An
appropriate carbon pricing structure should
be transparent in how prices are set, equi-
table in how revenue is appropriated to miti-
gate costs on the most vulnerable commu-
nities, and built to ensure our global com-
petitiveness.
I fully agree.
Following on those food companies’
heels, Microsoft announced that it, too,
would begin advocating in Congress for
Federal climate action. It joined the
Climate Leadership Council—a group
of economists, policymakers, busi-
nesses, and environmental groups—
formed in 2017, to advance a price on
carbon. Like the food companies,
Microsoft sees a Federal price on car-
bon as the best policy to tackle climate
change.
Then, in May, 13 more companies an-
nounced the CEO Climate Dialogue to
advocate for climate action. Once
again, these companies declared that
they supported a price on carbon:
An economy-wide price on carbon is the
best way to use the power of the market to
achieve carbon reduction goals, in a simple,
coherent and efficient manner. We desire to
do this at the least cost to the economy and
households. Markets will also spur innova-
tion, and create and preserve quality jobs in
a growing low-carbon economy.
Note that last sentence: ‘‘Markets
will also spur innovation, and create
and preserve quality jobs in a growing
low-carbon economy.’’
One of the weird things about all of
the remorseless opposition to climate
action out of the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce and the National Association of
Manufacturers is that there is a heck
of a lot of commerce and a heck of a lot
of manufacturing in climate change so-
lutions. So why are they so against
them? It is an anomaly but not the
only anomaly in climate denial.
Republican colleagues who wax po-
etic about the free market seem not to
notice this massive $650 billion subsidy
for carbon pollution. That is a big
thing not to notice if you are serious
about the free market. The last gasp of
climate obstruction here in Congress is
to talk about innovation as the magic
climate solution. Here is the rub: With-
out a clear market signal in the form
of a price on carbon, there will be little
incentive to innovate. How do you in-
novate away a $650 billion annual sub-
sidy? How does the market work to re-
duce carbon pollution when carbon pol-
lution is free? Innovations like carbon
capture and storage aren’t cheap.
There is not much of a business case
for these innovations—it is hard to see
the revenue proposition—unless we put
a price on carbon. Then innovation
happens.
Am I wrong about market theory?
Let’s go to Milton Friedman, the
Nobel Prize-winning patron saint of
market theory. He was unambiguous
about pricing pollution.
He was asked: Was there a case for
the government to do something about
pollution?
He responded:
Yes, there’s a case for the government to
do something. There’s always a case for the
government to do something about it . . .
when what two people do affects a third
party [ . . . ] But the question is, What’s the
best way to do it? And the best way to do it
is not to have bureaucrats in Washington
write rules and regulations. . . . The way to
do it is to impose a tax on the cost of the
pollutants . . . and make an incentive for
. . . manufacturers and for consumers to
keep down the amount of pollution.
So, yes, putting a price on pollution
to give an incentive to innovation is
core free market principle.
I happen to share that faith in the
power of the market to drive innova-
tion when the market is working. But
it is not going to happen when the mar-
ket is distorted by a $650 billion sub-
sidy.
That is why I filed a carbon pricing
bill to help correct that fossil fuel sub-
sidy and balance the market, so those
principles can go to work.
At the end of May, 75 companies
came to Capitol Hill to advocate for
carbon pricing. Together, those compa-
nies operate in all 50 States, have an-
nual revenues over $2.5 trillion, and
have a market value of nearly $2.5 tril-
lion.
These companies met with dozens of
lawmakers, both Democrats and Re-
publicans, to make the case for a price
on carbon—that it is the commonsense
policy to dramatically reduce carbon
pollution, drive the transition to a low
carbon economy, and grow jobs and the
economy. There is enormous economic
and scientific support for that argu-
ment. There is little opposition to that
argument or at least little opposition
that can’t be traced back to the mis-
chief of the fossil fuel industry and its
front groups. I hope my colleagues lis-
tened.
I also hope that other companies join
in and help the American business
community make climate action a

Washington, DC, priority. It can’t just
be talk. The fossil fuel industry isn’t
going to just walk away from a $650 bil-
lion annual subsidy. To offset the mil-
lions spent by the fossil fuel bandits
defending their license to pollute for
free is going to require some real effort
on the part of corporate America.
It is also going to take corporate
America getting control over the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce and the Na-
tional Association of Manufacturers.
The watchdog group InfluenceMap has
analyzed business associations around
the world. They found that the Cham-
ber and NAM—the National Associa-
tion of Manufacturers—are the worst—
the worst—the most obstructive when
it comes to climate action. Here they
are, rock bottom: U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, National Association of
Manufacturers—tail end of the worst.
Why? Why are the Chamber and NAM
the worst? If the majority of large
companies in America support climate
action, why do these two trade associa-
tions remain so opposed? Why are they
the worst?
I strongly recommend that if you are
a corporate member of one of these two
organizations—if you are a corporate
member of the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce, if you are a corporate member
of the National Association of Manu-
facturers—that you demand an audit—
that you demand an audit of these
trade associations’ funding because
here is what I expect you will find: You
will find that while they had you out
on the front porch as a prop for the
neighbors to see, they were in the back
room, secretly pocketing big money
from fossil fuel interests to stop cli-
mate legislation. My belief is that the
fossil fuel industry has given both the
Chamber and NAM so much money
that those two organizations have
chumped—chumped—their member or-
ganizations by ignoring their views on
climate in order to keep the money
pouring in secretly from the fossil fuel
industry.
The members are in a position to find
out. Ask. Demand an audit. Find out if
you have been chumped by the organi-
zations you support.
This trade association obstruction by
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the
National Association of Manufacturers
has to change, but it will not until
these trade associations’ member com-
panies demand a stop to the obstruc-
tion and demand real support for car-
bon pricing.
Let me close with a word of warning.
The alarms are ringing loudly. As one
scientist recently said: ‘‘The ocean is
screaming.’’ Financial crises loom. Our
failure over the last three decades to
address the climate crisis is a black
mark against both our democracy and
our system of free market capitalism.
Creepy-crawly political subservience to
fossil fuel interests has degraded Amer-
ican democracy, and free market cap-
italism is conspicuously failing to
meet the climate challenge. That can
change, but it has to change fast.
More than three decades ago, Rep-
resentative Claudine Schneider and
Senator John Chafee, both Republicans
from Rhode Island, introduced com-
prehensive legislation to address cli-
mate change—from Republicans, three
decades ago. Since then, the fossil fuel
industry’s campaign to obstruct cli-
mate progress has succeeded, but at a
terrible price. Every day that we fail to
address our climate crisis is a day that
we mortgage our children’s and our
grandchildren’s futures.
Through these long decades, the good
guys in corporate America have been
conspicuously absent. This recent ac-
tivity makes me optimistic—opti-
mistic that the business community
seems to be finally stepping up and op-
timistic that bipartisanship can be re-
stored.
Eyes are beginning to flutter open
around here. Now it is time not just to
wake up but to get to work.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT
Ms. COLLINS. As the senior Repub-
lican woman in the Senate today, I am
pleased to begin a series of speeches,
along with my good friend from Cali-
fornia, the senior Democratic woman
Senator, Mrs. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, to
commemorate a significant milestone
in our Nation’s history. One hundred
years ago today, the Senate finally
passed the 19th Amendment, which af-
firmed the right of women to vote in
elections.
All of us recall that in 1775, as the
Second Continental Congress was forg-
ing a new Nation conceived in liberty,
Abigail Adams admonished her hus-
band John to ‘‘remember the ladies.’’
Despite Abigail Adam’s advice, it took
nearly a century and a half for women
to achieve their rightful place as full
U.S. citizens.
On June 4, 1919, the U.S. Senate
passed the 19th Amendment to our
Constitution. The courage and deter-
mination exhibited by generations of
women and men were rewarded in just
two sentences:
The rights of citizens of the United States
to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the
United States or by any State on account of
sex. Congress shall have the power to enforce
this article by appropriate legislation.
That is it. Those are the words of the
19th Amendment, guaranteeing women
the right to vote.
It is an honor today to join my 24
women Senate colleagues in cospon-
soring a resolution commemorating
this centennial. The yellow roses that
we are wearing are a historic and en-
during symbol of the victory that we
celebrate today.
It has often been said, as Emerson
put it, that ‘‘there is properly no his-
tory; only biography.’’ The story of
women’s suffrage is an anthology of re-
markable biographies.
Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia
Mott led the Seneca Falls Convention
of 1848. This marked the first time that
American women formally demanded
the vote. The convention produced the
landmark Declaration of Sentiments.
Using the Declaration of Independence
as a template, it states: ‘‘We hold these
truths to be self-evident: That all men
and women are created equal.’’
The early women’s rights movement
was closely linked to the abolition of
slavery. Lucretia Mott made her posi-
tion clear. She said:
‘‘I have no idea of submitting tamely to in-
justice inflicted either on me or on the slave.
I will oppose it with all the moral powers
with which I am endowed.’’
Among the most vigorous advocates
of women’s suffrage were those who
knew too well the lash of oppression,
the escaped slaves Frederick Douglass,
Sojourner Truth, and Harriet Tubman.
Another very important incident in
the march of history occurred in 1872.
Susan B. Anthony and 14 other women
in Rochester, New York, illegally voted
in that year’s Presidential election.
They were promptly arrested. Susan B.
Anthony was put on trial, convicted,
and ordered to pay a fine of $100 or face
imprisonment. Imagine—for voting.
She bravely refused, saying that she
would never submit to this ‘‘high-hand-
ed outrage upon my citizen’s rights.’’
The authorities wisely chose not to
pursue collecting the fine.
Suffrage leaders realized that noth-
ing short of a constitutional amend-
ment would do—one modelled after the
15th Amendment, which granted the
vote to all men regardless of race.
With new leaders—such as Carrie
Chapman Catt and, later, Alice Paul—
stepping forward, a strategy was devel-
oped to use every peaceful instrument
to change the hearts and minds of po-
litical leaders and the public. In addi-
tion to marches, rallies, and petitions,
they enlisted the power of the pulpit
and the press in their just cause.
It took more than four decades for
this strategy to succeed, and strong
Maine women played key roles. Kath-
erine Reed Balentine, the daughter of
the legendary Speaker of the House of
Representatives, Thomas Brackett
Reed, led the Maine Woman Suffrage
Association. Author and activist Flor-
ence Brooks Whitehouse became a na-
tionally known suffrage organizer and
offered these words to opponents of
this cause: ‘‘This you must know; the
world is mine, as yours.’’
I am proud to report that when the
19th Amendment came to the Senate
floor on that historic day, exactly 100
years ago, both of Maine’s Senators,
Republicans Bert Fernald and Fred-
erick Hale, were among the 56 voting in
favor. Following Senate passage, all

that remained was for 36 of the 48
States to vote for ratification.
Maine became the 19th State to rat-
ify the 19th Amendment, but it wasn’t
easy. An earlier popular referendum on
women’s suffrage in Maine got clob-
bered at the polls by a margin of nearly
2 to 1. Of course, women were not al-
lowed to vote on their own future,
which obviously skewed the results.
Recognizing the inherent unfairness
of the situation, Maine’s Republican
Governor, Carl Milliken, called an
emergency session of the State legisla-
ture and ushered the measure through
by a vote of 72 to 68.
By the summer of 1920, only one more
State was needed to reach the magic
number of 36. The Nation’s eyes were
on the State of Tennessee, where the
amendment was before the legislature.
The outlook was discouraging. After
two rollcall votes, suffrage opponents,
who wore red roses on their lapels,
were in a dead heat with the yellow
rose supporters. If the measure failed
to pass in Tennessee, the 19th Amend-
ment would not be ratified.
At the last possible moment, the
youngest Tennessee lawmaker, Harry
Burn, despite the red rose that he
wore—which indicated you were in op-
position—cast his vote in favor of rati-
fication.
After evading an angry mob by
climbing out of a third floor window in
the Maine Capitol Building and hiding
in the attic, Representative Burn ex-
plained that he changed his mind after
he received a letter from his mother,
telling him: ‘‘Don’t forget to be a good
boy’’ and to do the right thing.
I am sure the Presiding Officer is
very familiar with this story.
One of my inspirations in public serv-
ice, Maine Senator Margaret Chase
Smith, once addressed the question of
what is a woman’s proper place. Her fa-
mous short answer was this: ‘‘Every-
where.’’
The rest of her answer describes the
importance of the struggle and the suc-
cess that we celebrate today. She said:
‘‘If there is any proper place for women
today, it is that of alert and respon-
sible citizens in the fullest sense of the
word.’’
It is a great pleasure to join my col-
leagues—particularly the senior Demo-
cratic woman Senator, DIANNE FEIN-
STEIN of California—in saluting those
great, courageous, and persistent
women who, over many long decades
and through much difficulty, guided
our Nation to that proper place by giv-
ing women the long, overdue right to
be full citizens in this country—the
right to vote.
Madam President, it is now my great
pleasure to yield to my friend and dis-
tinguished colleague, Senator FEIN-
STEIN.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I want to thank
my distinguished colleague from the
great State of Maine. Thank you so
much, Susan. Thank you for your work
here, for your care, for your concern,
and for your vigilance on all issues
that affect women. Thank you so
much.
Madam President, I am very proud to
join SUSAN COLLINS and all of my col-
leagues on the floor today to celebrate
the 100th anniversary of Congress’s
passing the 19th Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution.
Before the 19th Amendment, women
were actually denied the same basic
civil rights as men. We were not al-
lowed to attend a college. We could not
become doctors, lawyers, or politicians.
Married women had no right to prop-
erty, and even though women were re-
quired to follow the law, they had no
say in electing their lawmakers.
Simply put, women were second-class
citizens. So it is against this backdrop
that the women’s suffrage movement
took shape decades ago to fight to
achieve equality for us, and the fight
began at the polls.
In 1916 President Woodrow Wilson
faced a tough reelection campaign. At
the time, 12 States allowed women to
vote. The newly formed Women’s Party
campaigned forcefully in most States
against Wilson because of his strong
opposition to women’s suffrage. As a
result, women voted against Wilson by
notable margins, causing the first
known gender gap in a Presidential
election.
Although Woodrow Wilson ulti-
mately won a second term, the Wom-
en’s Party made clear that they were a
force to be reckoned with. I could not
be more proud of the suffragists who
fought for decades to secure our right
to vote and laid the groundwork for a
woman’s right to hold office. It is be-
cause of fearless, hardworking women
like Alice Paul, Lucy Burns, and Doro-
thy Day that I stand here today on the
floor of the Senate representing the
largest State in the Union, California.
In the first elections held after the
19th Amendment was ratified, women
won public office in 23 States. Today,
women are represented in all levels of
government—Federal, State, and local.
In 1992, the first year I was elected to
the Senate, a historic number of
women won elected office. Twenty-four
new women were elected to the U.S.
House of Representatives that year,
and four women—Senators MURRAY,
Boxer, Mosley-Braun, and I—were
elected to the Senate. Last year, near-
ly a century after Congress passed the
19th Amendment, women set another
record with 102 women serving in Con-
gress and 3 more holding seats on the
U.S. Supreme Court. So women are
still shattering the glass ceilings.
In 2014, Janet Yellen became the first
woman to lead the Federal Reserve. In
2016, Hillary Clinton became the first
woman to be nominated by a major po-
litical party for President of the
United States. And just this year, after
being elected the first female Speaker
of the House in 2007, NANCY PELOSI be-
came the first woman to be reelected
Speaker of the House.
Last Congress, I became the first
woman to serve as the ranking member
of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
This is especially significant for me be-
cause I was inspired by Anita Hill’s tes-
timony before the all-male Senate Ju-
diciary Committee to run for this of-
fice.
Even though there are more women
in leadership positions across indus-
tries, there is still work to be done. Ac-
cording to the American Association of
University Women, in 2017 women
earned between 77 cents and 53 cents
for every dollar earned by men.
SUSAN COLLINS, we still have a long
way to go, it seems to me.
In addition, women continue to face
discrimination and harassment at
school and in the office, as well as high
rates of sexual violence.
Before I close, I would like to address
an issue that has unfortunately been in
the news quite a bit lately; that is, the
latest attacks on women’s health and
reproductive rights. We should not for-
get what Justice Ginsburg told the
Senate Judiciary Committee during
her confirmation hearings in 1992. I was
there, and here is what she said:
The decision whether or not to bear a child
is central to a woman’s life, to her well-being
and dignity. It is a decision she must make
for herself. When Government controls that
decision for her, she is being treated as less
than a fully adult human responsible for her
own choices.
In the past month, six States have
passed blatantly unconstitutional laws
that effectively ban abortion, even in
cases of rape and incest. These new re-
strictions are especially concerning in
light of the new conservative majority
on the Supreme Court, which has long
signaled its opposition to women’s re-
productive rights. Just last month, in a
case challenging abortion restrictions
in Indiana, Justice Thomas authored
an opinion comparing contraceptives
to eugenics and demonstrated a clear
hostility to Griswold and Roe. Between
the Indiana case, the various unconsti-
tutional State laws, and other repro-
ductive rights cases on the Court’s
docket, many legal observers believe
Roe today remains in jeopardy.
As a U.S. Senator, I will continue
fighting for equal rights for women,
and I will honor the legacy of women
who blazed the trail. I am honored to
recognize those women and the
progress we have made as we com-
memorate the 100th anniversary of
Congress passing the 19th Amendment
to the U.S. Constitution.

S3190 June 4, 2019
Founders whose gender or skin tone
may not be represented on Mount
Rushmore but whose brilliance, whose
resilience, helped ensure that the de-
mocracy we have today is strong and
true.
This democracy wasn’t just built by
George Washington or Thomas Jeffer-
son. It wasn’t perfected in the 18th cen-
tury when the ink dried on the four
original pages of the Constitution.
It was shaped by women like Abigail
Adams, whom I named my first daugh-
ter after. It was strengthened by suf-
fragists like Sojourner Truth, who
worked tirelessly to better the country
that had kept her in chains, who used
her emancipation to call for freedom
and a voice for all women—Black,
White, you name it. It was formed by
Illinoisans like Ida B. Wells, who de-
manded that women of color have a
place at the forefront of the suffrage
movement. It was forged by women
like Mary Livermore, who channeled
her frustration over women’s inequal-
ity into action, spearheading Chicago’s
first-ever suffrage convention 150 years
ago and marking Illinois as a leader in
the fight for women’s rights.
Our democracy was sharpened by a
group of Illinoisans who traveled to
Washington, DC, in 1913, joining thou-
sands of other women in their march
down Pennsylvania Avenue—protesters
who were vilified, berated, jostled,
tripped, and even jailed but who with-
stood it all to call for a constitutional
amendment giving women the right to
vote.
This Union was made more perfect
when the 19th Amendment finally
passed Congress 100 years ago today.
These women raised their voices on
the picket lines so that we could make
ours heard at the polls. They risked
safety and security, withstood hypoc-
risy and overcame misogyny, refusing
to stay silent so that their daughters
and their daughters’ daughters would
inherit the democracy they deserved.
For that, we are forever in their debt.
Of course, every American’s right to
vote wasn’t truly secured that day in
1919, nor was it secured later that
week, when Illinois became one of the
first States to ratify the amendment,
or in 1965, when Lyndon B. Johnson
picked up a pen and signed the Voting
Rights Act into law.
It still is not secure today—not when
voter suppression tactics still block so
many people of color from the ballot,
when voter roll purges are still com-
mon and some in power are still fight-
ing to install modern-day poll taxes.
So we can’t get complacent. What
began at Seneca Falls continues with
us today, as it now falls to our genera-
tion to keep alive the work of yester-
day’s suffragists, to keep pushing for
bills like the Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act to ensure that bigoted State
laws don’t disenfranchise any Amer-
ican. It falls on us to keep fighting for
that more perfect Union, to keep mak-
ing our voices heard—whether that is
here on the Senate floor or anywhere
else—so that finally, some day soon,
every American can make theirs heard
at the ballot box.
I yield the floor.
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I
suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I

MURKOWSKI.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President,
I rise today to join my colleagues as we
commemorate the 100th anniversary of
the date Congress sent to the States
this question: the ratification of a con-
stitutional amendment granting
women the right to vote.
Our ancestors have long sought the
promise of a better life for themselves
and their children. Many of our
forebearers came to this country seek-
ing religious liberty, economic secu-
rity, or personal freedom.
Since 1788, they were drawn to the
promise of these words: ‘‘We the People
of the United States, in Order to form
a more perfect Union, establish Jus-
tice, insure domestic Tranquility, pro-
vide for the common defence, promote
the general Welfare, and secure the
Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and
our Posterity, do ordain and establish
this Constitution for the United States
of America.’’
Today, most in this body and across
the country would agree that a wom-
an’s full participation in the life of her
community and Nation are crucial if
the promise laid out in our Constitu-
tion’s preamble is ever to be fully real-
ized.
But in 1788 and for many years there-
after, women could not own property,
could not open a bank account on their
own, or even control the money that
they earned through their own work.
They could not control their destiny
or, indeed, their own bodies. Justice,
tranquility, the general welfare, and
the blessings of liberty were, for
women, what men said they were.
That all began to change on June 4,
1919, the date when finally, after so
many years of struggle and failure, the
required number of Senators voted aye
for House Joint Resolution 1, ‘‘pro-
posing an amendment to the Constitu-
tion extending the right of suffrage to
women.’’ It was very simple yet in-
tensely powerful, a resolution with just
one article that read:
The right of citizens of the United States
to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the
United States or by any State on account of
sex. Congress shall have the power to enforce
this article by appropriate legislation.
That remarkable moment, we know,
did not come easily. For decades,
women across America sought the
promise of our Nation for themselves
and their daughters. They were sub-
jected to insults and ridicule and,
sometimes, even imprisonment and vi-
olence.
In 1906, an editorial in the New York
Times defined the word ‘‘suffragette’’
as a ‘‘demanding screecher’’ and ‘‘a
woman who ought to have more sense.’’
Walking in parades in support of the
right to vote, women had insults and
worse hurled at them. Suffragists were
physically attacked.
Beginning in June of 1917, it got
much worse. Here in Washington, DC,
police began arresting women who were
picketing the White House in support
of suffrage for ‘‘obstructing sidewalk
traffic.’’ Throughout the summer and
into the fall, women who refused to pay
the fine were sent to the Women’s
Workhouse in Lorton, VA, or the dis-
trict jail, where conditions were de-
plorable. Rats ran free in the prison.
The food was infested with maggots.
Alice Paul, a leader of the National
Woman’s Party, and about 71 other
women began a hunger strike while in
jail and for months suffered force-feed-
ing of raw eggs in milk through nasal
gastric tubes. In November, 33 of the
imprisoned suffragists were beaten by
guards by order of the prison super-
intendent. One woman’s hands were
handcuffed high above her head on the
prison door for an entire night. Some
were left unconscious.
Sojourner Truth, Lucy Stone, Julia
Ward Howe, Ida B. Wells, Mary Church
Terrell, Alice Paul, and others are
widely known as suffragist leaders.
There were millions of others across
the country doing what they could in
their own families, in their own com-
munities and States, to advance wom-
en’s rights. They marched, protested,
sewed flags and banners, and spoke up
at home and in their hometowns.
In the following 100 years since the
Senate sent the women’s right to vote
to the States for ratification, the right
to vote gave women the power to
change their lives and to impact our
Nation in so many positive and pro-
found ways. As a result, our Nation has
made incredible strides.
Today, in 2019, it may be difficult for
some to imagine an America without
women leaders in every conceivable en-
deavor. Amazing women have contrib-
uted to our Nation in countless ways,
both large and small. We have moved
from the horse and buggy era to put-
ting a man on the moon, but man
would not have gotten there and back
without women mathematicians and
engineers.
While few colleges admitted women a
century ago, by 1980 more women than
men earned bachelor’s degrees. Since
1919, women are able to enter any pro-
fession for which they are qualified,
keep their own wages, start and run
corporations, lead scientific and med-
ical advances, and fly into space.
Women have the right to be heard in

the Halls of Congress and in their chil-
dren’s schools. We are allowed to deter-
mine the guilt or innocence of an ac-
cused and volunteer as poll workers.
We can inherit property, run the
Iditarod, and become mayors and Gov-
ernors. And we can not only run for of-
fice, but we can vote for ourselves.
Women can do anything we put our
minds to, but if it had not been for the
right to vote—the basic, legal right to
be recognized—would we be where we
are today? Would we have women like
Sandra Day O’Connor, Condoleezza
Rice, Christiane Amanpour, or Sally
Ride? Would we have the benefit of the
voices of countless American women
who share their views with Congress
because they know that their opin-
ions—backed up by their votes—matter
on issues as varied as childcare, cli-
mate change, and national security?
Would the young women of today have
the faith that they really can do any-
thing they set their minds to? Maybe
not.
I rise today to call on all Americans
to commemorate this day, to remem-
ber all those who made it possible, and
to honor them by recognizing that the
right to vote, to be heard, and to be
valued is a precious right. It has not al-
ways been implemented fairly, and it
must be guarded and defended.
As we look to honor the past, we
must also acknowledge that, like our
ancestors, we have more progress to
make. Gaining the right to vote was
the first step toward full equality. De-
spite the passage of the Civil Rights
Act, which makes discrimination on
the basis of sex illegal, and despite the
Equal Pay Act and the Pregnancy Dis-
crimination Act, our Constitution
gives us the right to vote but does not
protect us from discrimination.
So in the spirit of women who fought
for the rights of women who would
come after them, I hope the Senate will
pass S.J. Res. 6 to remove the deadline
for ratification of the Equal Rights
Amendment. That will be something
we will bring up at another point in
time. But today, I am able to stand
with my friends and my colleagues
here in the Senate as we recognize and
honor those who paved the way and
have allowed for this right to vote,
that right and value to be heard.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). The Senator from Maine.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank
the Senator from Alaska for her elo-
quent comments.
I now yield to Senator MURRAY.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington.
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, 150
years ago, in Washington State, a suf-
fragette named Mary Olney Brown
went to vote, and like so many others
at the time, her vote was rejected.
Why? Because she was a woman. She
said: ‘‘The idea of a woman voting was
regarded as an absurdity.’’
Fifty years later, thanks to the tire-
less efforts of women like Mary Olney
Brown, that longstanding injustice fi-
nally began to change when this Cham-
ber passed the 19th Amendment to
guarantee women’s right to vote.
Today, as we celebrate the 100th an-
niversary of that important milestone
in the march for equality, it is inspir-
ing to see how far women have come
over the last century. When we passed
the 19th Amendment, there was only
one woman in Congress—Jeannette
Rankin. Before I ran for the Senate in
1992, there were two women Senators. I
was very proud to join the Senate in
1993 and to join with Senator Barbara
Mikulski, who is here today, and we be-
came six women in the Senate. Today,
there are 25 women serving in the Sen-
ate and 102 in the House of Representa-
tives. Today, women are Governors,
Fortune 500 CEOs, Nobel Prize-winning
researchers, and candidates for Presi-
dent.
It is clear we have come a long way,
but we still have more work to do.
Women may have more representation,
but we still make up less than a quar-
ter of Congress. Women of color are
still particularly underrepresented.
And we still have some ceilings left to
crack. Women are still paid less than
men for the same work, and the same
gap is even wider for women of color.
Women still bear most of the burden of
being a working parent, especially
when so many lack access to affordable
childcare and paid family leave. Nearly
50 years after Roe v. Wade was decided,
women are still fighting to defend their
right to make their own decisions
about their own bodies.
These injustices even extend to vot-
ing rights. Even after the 19th Amend-
ment was ratified, many women of
color were still denied the right to vote
by discriminatory barriers designed to
keep them from the ballot box. Today,
there are still far too many States that
have put into effect voter-suppression
efforts that disproportionately hurt
communities of color, like harsh voter
ID laws, limits on early voting, polling
machines, voting locations, and ‘‘exact
match’’ requirements that make it
easy to purge someone from the voter
rolls due to a typo.
After all the years women spent
fighting for their right to vote, it is un-
acceptable that these kinds of efforts
would strip that right away from any-
one, which is why we need to pass leg-
islation to restore the Voting Rights
Act to its full power to protect the
rights of voters across our country.
While there is still a lot of work
ahead to make good on the promise of
the 19th Amendment and make sure
that everyone in our country who is en-
titled to vote is actually able to vote
and that every woman is able to exer-
cise all of her rights under our Con-
stitution, I am confident we can get
there, and I want to say why.
After 2016, I watched as women across
the country stood up, spoke out, and
fought back. I saw as much energy as I
have seen in my lifetime as women
joined together against countless dif-
ferent efforts to roll back the clock on
their rights. I saw millions of women
turn out to march for their rights, and
then I saw millions of women turn out
to exercise those rights last November.
And what happened? They broke
records and barriers across the coun-
try, and afterwards, several States
started breaking down some of the bar-
riers that were put up to block people
from voting. I believe that momentum
is going to continue to build, especially
as women continue to reach out to
other women to build a bigger and
more inclusive coalition.
So today, as we celebrate the Senate
vote to pass the 19th Amendment, I
want to not only remember how hard
women fought to get that right to vote
but to promise that we are going to
keep fighting just as hard to protect it
for everyone in this country, and then
we are going to keep using it to fight
hard for the change we want to see in
our communities.
Thank you.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank
the Senator for her good remarks
today.
I am very pleased to yield time to the
Senator from Tennessee, Mrs. BLACK-
BURN.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee.
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I
thank the Senator from Maine for her
leadership in today’s activity as we
commemorate the Senate’s action in
passing the 19th Amendment and send-
ing that to the States for ratification.
It is amazing to think that it was 100
years ago today—today—that women
in this country still did not have the
right to vote. When we think about
Nashville, TN, today, we are thinking
about country music, bachelorette par-
ties, pro-sports; in the summer of 1920,
Nashville, TN, was the focus of individ-
uals on both sides of the debate over
women’s suffrage because that summer
was the final push to get the 19th
Amendment ratified so that women
would forever have the right to vote.
Suffragists from all across the country
looked to Tennessee in that last-ditch
effort to pass an amendment before the
1920 Presidential elections.
As it all came together and as every-
body was coming into Nashville—you
had the red roses on one side and the
yellow roses on the other side—the bat-
tle was heating up. The Tennessee
House of Representatives had been
called back into a special session so
that they could debate this issue:
Would women receive the right to
vote? Would Tennessee agree to vote
for ratification of the 19th Amend-
ment?
The pro and anti suffragists flooded
that city. Those who opposed enfran-
chisement, wearing those red roses,
went to extreme lengths to prevent a
vote. At one point, legislators actually
fled the State to prevent a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3192 June 4, 2019
They left the State so they would not
have to say where they stood on the
issue of women having the right to
vote. But let me tell you, against those
Tennessee women, against suffragists
from across the country, all wearing
their yellow roses, those legislators
never stood a chance.
You have all heard of Susan B. An-
thony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, but
let me introduce you to a few more of
those fierce female fighters from the
summer of 1920. There was Anne Dallas
Dudley from Nashville, who was really
quite an organizer; Abby Crawford Mil-
ton; Sue Shelton White from West Ten-
nessee; and, as has been mentioned, Ida
B. Wells, who was from Memphis. They
are all Tennesseans who fought tire-
lessly on behalf of suffrage and brought
the State’s house of representatives to
that fateful vote on August 18, 1920.
The Senator from Maine talked a mo-
ment earlier about a young legislator,
the youngest member of the House of
Representatives in the State of Ten-
nessee. His name was Harry T. Burn.
Harry was from Niota, TN. He was a
freshman house of representatives
member. He switched his vote from nay
to yea, broke a tie, and made history.
As the Senator from Maine said, he did
it because of a letter written to him by
his mother, who reminded him that he
should be a good boy and help Ms.
Catt—Carrie Chapman Catt—put the
‘‘rat’’ in ‘‘ratification.’’ He did, and so
it was official: Tennessee had become
the 36th and final State needed for rati-
fication of the 19th Amendment.
That journey from Seneca Falls, NY,
to Nashville, TN, was hard-fought.
Sometimes we don’t think about how
long it took. It was a 72-year journey—
72 years—from the Seneca Falls Con-
vention to that final vote in Nashville,
TN.
Think about this: The women who
started this push for women’s suffrage
were not alive to see it become the law
of the land and become a constitu-
tionally guaranteed right. And the
women who voted in that 1920 Presi-
dential election, many—most of them
were not even alive when the fight
began. But the women who started the
fight did it because they knew that
women receiving the right to vote was
a worthy fight. Today, we owe them so
much gratitude for the work they did
100 years ago today in pushing this
through the U.S. Senate.
My colleague, Senator KIRSTEN
GILLIBRAND of New York, has joined me
in working to pass the Women’s Suf-
frage Centennial Commemorative Coin
Act. We are doing that here in the Sen-
ate, and in the House, two of our col-
leagues—Representative ELISE
STEFANIK from New York and BRENDA
LAWRENCE—have introduced a com-
panion bill.
The legislation authorizes the Treas-
ury to mint silver coins honoring the
work of women suffrage activists. The
coins will be issued in 2020, which also
marks the centennial anniversary of
the passage, the ratification of the 19th
Amendment. Proceeds from sales of the
coin will support the important work
of the Smithsonian Institution’s Amer-
ican Women’s History Initiative.
It is my hope that because of this,
more young women will look to history
for guidance and feel very proud of
what they learn about the women suf-
fragists, that the little girl who is fol-
lowing her mom into the voting booth
will begin to understand and appreciate
why so many women are standing in
line at the polls to cast their vote, and
that women who want to change things
in their community or their State or
their country will stop waiting for
someone else to take the lead and will
realize they are empowered to do this
because of actions that were taken
over 100 years ago.
In 1916, famed suffragist Carrie Chap-
man Catt stood before the National
American Woman Suffrage Associa-
tion, and she declared:
The time has come to shout aloud in every
city, village, and hamlet, and in tones so
clear and jubilant that they will reverberate
from every mountain peak and echo from
shore to shore: The Woman’s Hour has
struck.
Indeed, the woman’s hour did strike
and shout, these ladies did.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank
the Senator from Tennessee for giving
us such a great history lesson, and I ap-
preciate her remarks.
Next on our list of speakers is Sen-
ator ERNST followed by Senator SHA-
HEEN.
I yield to Senator ERNST of Iowa.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa.
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I thank
Senator COLLINS and Senator FEIN-
STEIN for arranging this afternoon’s
visit on the floor of the U.S. Senate. It
is a privilege to have the opportunity
to come to the floor today to recognize
the courageous and determined women
behind the women’s suffrage move-
ment.
These trailblazing women, and count-
less more like them, paved the way for
women in my home State of Iowa and
across the Nation to have the right to
vote. They forged a path for women
like me and all of my absolutely re-
markable female colleagues joining me
on the Senate floor today.
On this 100th anniversary of the pas-
sage of the 19th Amendment, it is easy
to think of these courageous women as
institutions and visions of strength and
perseverance, and that is absolutely
what those women are.
They were also once young girls and
young women seeking to understand
the answer to simple questions like:
Why can’t my mother vote in an elec-
tion? Why can’t I pursue my dreams?
All too often, the response back then
to these questions was simply to tell
women that politics and government
were too complicated or important for
our gender to have a role in it. ‘‘Best
leave it to the men to figure out these
tough matters.’’ That is what they
would say.
I think the 127 women in Congress
this year would have something very
different to say about that. To be hon-
est, I don’t know if the suffragettes
completely understood the tremendous
impact their efforts would have now a
century later.
They secured more than just the
right to vote. The passage of the 19th
Amendment has led to immeasurable
progress in the right for women’s
equality on all fronts. I see their spirit
in the girls and women, young and old,
I meet each and every day in my job as
a U.S. Senator.
I was recently at a women’s net-
working event where Gen. Jennifer
Walter, the first female Iowa Air Guard
general in the Iowa National Guard,
talked about her career options when
she graduated high school over four
decades ago. They were very limited, to
say the least. She could be a typist or
work in a clerking job in the Air Force
or she could be a nurse. Those were the
options that were open to her, but Gen-
eral Walter is not one to be boxed in.
She decided to forge her own path
forward. That led her to the Air Na-
tional Guard, first in Kansas and then
in my home State of Iowa. There were
still plenty of obstacles, but she was
unwavering. Walter was going to prove
she belonged and could reach her full
potential.
Even in my own life, I have benefited
from the hard work and the commit-
ment of these women trailblazers. That
is especially clear when I look back on
my 23 years of service in the Army Re-
serve and the Iowa Army National
Guard.
When I joined the service after col-
lege, there were no opportunities for
women in combat. By 2003, I was a
company commander leading supply
convoys in combat zones in Iraq. Like
me, hundreds of women were serving
the cause of freedom, and some were
even paying the ultimate price for our
Nation. Yet women could not even for-
mally serve in combat fields or occupa-
tions until 2013.
Now I look at my daughter, Libby, as
she prepares to enter her second year
at West Point, and she also considers
entering combat arms. She has so
many opportunities ahead of her be-
cause of the strong women that came
before her.
It is truly an honor to be in the com-
pany of so many remarkable women on
the Senate floor today to commemo-
rate the 100th anniversary of the pas-
sage of the 19th Amendment giving
women the right to vote, and it is all
the more fitting that we do so during a
time when there are more women serv-
ing in the U.S. Senate than any other
time in history.
We come from every imaginable
background and from every corner of
our great and beautiful country. I will
continue to challenge every one of our

young women today who are contem-
plating serving our country in govern-
ment or in the armed services to say
yes and to jump into that arena. We
are a better nation because of the con-
tributions of women in all walks of life
and in all fields of service and in both
Chambers of Congress.
Again, I offer my great thanks to
Senator SUSAN COLLINS and Senator
DIANNE FEINSTEIN of California for the
opportunity to speak today.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, before I
yield to my friend and neighbor from
New Hampshire, I recognize, in the
back of the Chamber, a truly extraor-
dinary woman, an outstanding former
U.S. Senator who served in this Cham-
ber from 1987 to 2017, some 30 years,
Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland.
She has served on the Commission that
has worked very hard to make sure we
commemorate this centennial of wom-
en’s suffrage, and she has been a men-
tor and friend to all of us who had the
pleasure of serving with her.
I welcome Senator Mikulski back to
the U.S. Senate, which was her home
for so many years and where she still
has so many friends and admirers, of
whom I count myself one.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Chair counts himself one as well.
Ms. COLLINS. The Chair is a very
wise man.
Now I yield to Senator JEANNE SHA-
HEEN.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire.
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I
thank my neighbor and friend, Senator
COLLINS, and Senator FEINSTEIN—the
two of them for organizing this after-
noon’s conversation on the floor in rec-
ognition of the 100th anniversary of the
passage of the 19th Amendment.
I also begin by recognizing Senator
Mikulski, who was such a trailblazer
for so many women. I remember being
a young woman involved in politics in
the late eighties in New Hampshire
right after she was elected to the Sen-
ate, and she came up and spoke to us.
At the time, I was not sure there was
ever an opportunity for a woman in
New Hampshire to go anywhere, and
listening to her made me realize there
were opportunities for women every-
where, and we need to take advantage
of them, so I thank Senator Mikulski.
Today we celebrate not only the pas-
sage of the 19th Amendment but the
countless women who fought for dec-
ades before 1919 so that women would
one day realize the full rights pro-
tected under the Constitution.
As so many of my colleagues have
said, we remember women like Eliza-
beth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott,
who organized the first women’s rights
convention at Seneca Falls in 1848;
Susan B. Anthony, who took up the
fight following the first convention,
and Harriet Tubman, Ida Wells, and So-
journer Truth, who worked tirelessly
for women’s rights all while battling
the forces of slavery and racism. These
women and so many others faced ex-
traordinary obstacles as they pro-
tested, marched, lobbied, and, at times,
sacrificed their own freedom so women
could one day secure the right to vote.
The leaders of the women’s suffrage
movement understood the fundamental
truth; that the rights protected under
the Constitution are merely privileges
if they are not enjoyed by everyone in
our society.
As Susan B. Anthony put it in 1873,
‘‘It was we, the people; not we, the
white male citizens; not yet we, the
male citizens; but we, the whole people,
who formed the Union. And we formed
it, not to give the blessings of liberty,
but to secure them; not to the half of
ourselves . . . . but to the whole peo-
ple—women as well as men.’’
The suffrage movement was, of
course, an effort to achieve political
equality for women, but it was also an
effort to secure a more perfect Union
by giving life to the ideals laid out in
our founding documents. This pursuit
for equality continues today, and it is
in the spirit of our trailblazers that
women carry on the fight for full
equality under the law.
It is in that spirit that we are here
this afternoon on the floor of the Sen-
ate to talk about the importance of
carrying on the tradition of our Found-
ing Mothers. These figures are an im-
portant part of our history, and be-
cause of the generations of women they
inspired, their legacy lives on today.
We must remember their stories and
honor their sacrifices. Those sacrifices
have helped shape the identity of our
Nation, and it is why we celebrate
these women in the same regard as we
have our Founding Fathers. It is why
the issue, for me, of keeping a promise
to redesign the $20 bill with the like-
ness of Harriet Tubman is so impor-
tant.
The United States was not shaped ex-
clusively by men, and our living his-
tory, which our currency is a part of,
should reflect that because the symbols
that we have for our country matter.
Leaders of the women’s suffrage
movement rose from communities
across this country, but today I would
like to recognize one of the pioneers of
that movement from my own State of
New Hampshire, Armenia S. White.
Armenia spent most of her life in
Concord, NH, which is our capital. She
was active in the community, includ-
ing supporting the abolitionist and
temperance movements, but the cause
for which she was most passionate was
securing the vote for women.
Armenia was the first signer of the
call for an equal suffrage convention in
New Hampshire, which was held in
Concord in 1868. She was also the first
president of the New Hampshire
Woman Suffrage Association, a posi-
tion that she held for nearly 50 years.
When the time came for New Hamp-
shire to send a delegate to the Amer-
ican Woman Suffrage Association, or-
ganized in Cleveland, Armenia was se-
lected and served in that position for
decades.
Armenia’s efforts in New Hampshire
were largely responsible for the deci-
sions by the State legislature in 1871
and 1878 to make women eligible to
serve on school committees. I think it
is interesting that we were eligible to
serve on school committees before we
were eligible to serve in the legisla-
ture. But, nevertheless, not only did
she help women become eligible to
serve on school committees, but she se-
cured women a vote in local school dis-
trict elections.
Sadly, Armenia never lived to see
women secure the right to vote with
the passage of the 19th Amendment,
but her efforts to improve equality in
New Hampshire and throughout the
Nation left an enduring impact on the
movement. It is an impact that, as the
first woman elected to be Governor of
New Hampshire and then elected to be
Senator there, I have benefited from. I
feel a deep sense of gratitude to Arme-
nia and to so many women who came
before me for forging a path so that
women could one day serve in public
office and so that one day we could
vote.
Alice Paul, the leader of the women’s
suffrage movement, once described
women’s suffrage saying:
I always feel the movement is a sort of mo-
saic. Each of us puts in one little stone, and
then you get a great mosaic at the end.
As we recognize and celebrate the
passage of the 19th Amendment, we
must remember that there is still so
much work to do, and even the small-
est stones contribute to this great mo-
saic.
I thank the Presiding Officer and
thank again my colleagues, Senator
COLLINS and Senator FEINSTEIN, for
leading this effort.
We still have a lot of work to do.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank
the Senator from New Hampshire, and
it is now my pleasure to yield time to
the Senator from Nebraska, Mrs.
FISCHER.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska.
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I, too,
would like to thank the senior Senator
from Maine and the senior Senator
from California for organizing the col-
loquy we are having on the floor today
in recognition of a very historic mo-
ment.
To have Senator COLLINS be a leader
here in the U.S. Senate has been just a
wonderful experience for me and to
share with her the last 7 years that I
have been here. She is truly a leader,
and she is a mentor to both men and
women here in the Senate. I always tell
people, if you want to see a true legis-
lator, you need to watch SUSAN COL-
LINS.
Mr. President, I rise today with great
honor and pride to join my colleagues
in recognizing the 100th anniversary of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3194 June 4, 2019
the Senate passage of the 19th Amend-
ment, which did pave the way for wom-
en’s constitutional right to vote in this
country. Today we celebrate this his-
toric milestone, and we honor the suf-
fragists, women of courage who were
pioneers and leaders.
These women who fought for their
God-given right to vote in the greatest
democracy the world has ever seen
must be remembered. Nearly 100 years
ago, with picket signs in hand, Alice
Paul led hundreds of brave suffragists
to the White House to advocate for the
essential role of women’s right to vote
in this Republic.
Today, almost a century later,
women make up half of the electorate.
According to the Pew Research Center,
more women voted than men in the
2018 elections.
As I stand today in this Chamber
alongside the women of the Senate, I
am so grateful for the strength of the
women who came before us. On this
historic day, I would like to reflect on
some of Nebraska’s strong and very in-
fluential women who have made a dif-
ference. Susette LaFlesche Tibbles
served as a translator for Chief Stand-
ing Bear during his famous speech
when he fought for Native Americans
to keep their land. Pulitzer Prize-win-
ning author Willa Cather is renowned
for her work chronicling life on the
Great Plains. And biographer, histo-
rian, and teacher Mari Sandoz invested
in the next generation of creative writ-
ers.
I also think of women in politics
from my home State of Nebraska who
inspired me to serve my community,
my State, and my country. I think of
Kay Orr, Nebraska’s first female Gov-
ernor and the first female Republican
Governor in the United States. I think
of Virginia Smith, my congressional
Representative and the first woman
from Nebraska to hold a seat in the
U.S. House of Representatives.
Let’s not forget the stories of the suf-
fragists and all of the women through-
out our Nation’s history whose courage
and brilliance changed the world. It is
because of them that we stand today in
the hallowed Chamber of the U.S. Sen-
ate, with a record number of women
serving in Congress and record num-
bers of women exercising their con-
stitutional right to vote. We will never
forget the path that brought us here
today and the pioneers who fought for
the rights of millions of women to par-
ticipate in the core function of our Re-
public.
I encourage my Senate colleagues to
swiftly pass the resolution before us
today, and I hope in doing so that it
serves as encouragement and inspira-
tion for future generations of women
who will continue to write America’s
story.
Thank you again to Senators COLLINS
and FEINSTEIN and to all of my col-
leagues for sharing their stories, their
past, and their future vision for this
country.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want
to thank the Senator from Nebraska
for her very kind comments and her el-
oquent remarks, and I am now pleased
to yield time to the Senator from Wis-
consin, Ms. BALDWIN.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin.
Ms. BALDWIN. Thank you, Mr.
President. Thank you, Senator COL-
LINS.
I rise today proudly wearing a yellow
rose in solidarity with 24 other women
who serve in the U.S. Senate to recog-
nize what is a very historic milestone
in our Nation’s history. Almost 100
years ago, after decades and decades of
struggle by brave women and men, our
Nation finally extended to women the
most fundamental right of our democ-
racy—the right to vote. The struggle
for women’s suffrage was fought in
every corner of our country, and com-
munities all over the Nation are plan-
ning to recognize their contributions
over the next year.
Today marks precisely 100 years to
the day that the Senate passed the 19th
Amendment. I am proud to state that a
week later, on June 10, 1919, Wisconsin
became the first State in our Union to
ratify the 19th Amendment. I am al-
ways proud to say that my home State
was the very first to ratify women’s
right to vote, narrowly beating our
neighbor to the south, the State of Illi-
nois, because of a paperwork error. You
know, we are still first. I am especially
happy that I will forever have bragging
rights over my friend from Illinois, the
co-chair of the Senate caucus, Senator
TAMMY DUCKWORTH, because Illinois
wasn’t quite quick enough and Wis-
consin did it first.
I am also proud today to wear a pur-
ple ribbon. This ribbon is in recogni-
tion of the women of color who fought
and marched alongside their White col-
leagues in the suffrage movement but
whose contributions went largely un-
sung and many of whom were still de-
nied the right to vote after the 19th
Amendment was ratified.
As we observe and celebrate this his-
toric moment, we must be careful not
to mistake progress for victory. With
just 131 women currently serving in
Congress, we are well short of equal
representation in government. Govern-
ment works best when legislatures re-
flect the people they work for—when
they look like America. That is why it
is important to increase the number of
women who serve in public office.
Women are half the population. We
should be half of our Nation’s govern-
ment, too.
When I first entered public service, I
had the opportunity to sit on the Madi-
son City Council. I remember well a
meeting when I had one of those light
bulb moments of the difference that
women make when we serve.
The city council that day was debat-
ing whether to extend service and add
an additional bus route that went di-
rectly to the Madison Area Technical
College’s new campus. I remember lis-
tening to my male colleagues and their
participation in the debate. There was
a lot of focus on funding and logistics
and finger pointing at which body in
government should bear this responsi-
bility. At first, they didn’t seem to
think that the city council should take
action to add another bus route.
Then I began hearing the voices of
my female colleagues. They began
speaking of and describing their experi-
ence traveling to campus. They spoke
about evening classes and having to
walk a long distance down a poorly lit
road to get to the nearest bus stop.
They spoke about the dangers of walk-
ing home alone at night. Most women
can identify with the fear of walking or
commuting home late at night. It
seemed that the men in the debate
hadn’t thought about it in the same
way before that moment. The whole de-
bate changed as soon as women’s voices
were heard, and the city council ulti-
mately voted to fund a new route that
went right to the campus door.
Women bring their life experiences to
the job. It helps inform our debate, our
votes, and the policies that we deliver.
My experience with the women of the
U.S. Senate, past and present, is that
they ran for office and came to Wash-
ington to solve problems. I feel like we
are guided by the idea that our job is
to work together and to get things
done. That is what we do, both Demo-
crats and Republicans, as we work to-
gether to deliver solutions.
I worked with my colleague Senator
SUSAN COLLINS to pass legislation to
better support the more than 40 million
family caregivers in this country who
contribute millions of dollars each
year in uncompensated care for their
loved ones. I worked with my colleague
Senator JONI ERNST to pass legislation
to provide our Nation’s farmers and ag-
ricultural workers with the mental
health resources they need to deal with
the extreme economic stress that our
farmers have faced in recent years. I
worked with my colleague Senator
LISA MURKOWSKI to pass legislation
that will bring more obstetricians to
rural areas and expand access to ma-
ternity care to women so they no
longer have to drive hours to get the
healthcare they need or to deliver their
babies.
I appreciate these partnerships and
the many others that I have been able
to experience, and I look forward to
continuing to work together on a bi-
partisan basis to deliver results for the
American people. With more women in
public office, you will see more solu-
tions to the challenges and problems
we face. Women get stuff done.
In 2017, I was proud to lead bipartisan
legislation to establish the Women’s
Suffrage Centennial Commission and
ensure that we give this important an-
niversary the recognition and celebra-
tion it deserves. I am thrilled to say
that the Commission is now hard at
work in developing, supporting, and

lifting up commemorative efforts
across this country. It is working with
private organizations and government
at every level to encourage and help fa-
cilitate their events.
I give a particularly heartfelt thank-
you to my friend and former Senator
Barbara Mikulski, who helped to get
the Commission started and is now ac-
tually serving as a Commissioner.
I look forward to seeing the great
work of the Women’s Suffrage Centen-
nial Commission as we get closer to the
formal anniversary celebration of when
the 19th Amendment finally became
part of our Nation’s charter.
I am grateful today for the brave
women who came before us and fought
for the right of all American women to
have a say in their own government.
Thanks to their struggle, their persist-
ence, and their determination to bring
women the right to vote, I stand here
today as one of 25 women who serves in
the U.S. Senate and represents the
great State of Wisconsin.
We have more work to do, but in 2018,
more women ran for office and won
than ever before in our Nation’s his-
tory. As a result, we have a new Con-
gress that is starting to look just a lit-
tle bit more like the people it aims to
represent. Let’s keep building on that
progress, and let’s keep working to-
gether on solutions to the challenges
we face today.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am
now pleased to yield to the Senator
from Maryland, Mr. CARDIN.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland.
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank
Senator COLLINS for arranging for us to
celebrate the 100th anniversary of the
passage of women’s suffrage here in the
Senate.
I thank my colleague Senator FEIN-
STEIN for working together so that we
all have a chance to reflect on the
progress we made and the commitment
to make sure we continue to move for-
ward.
It was June 4, 1919—100 years ago
today—that the Senate passed the
women’s suffrage constitutional
amendment, but the campaign started
with the birth of our Nation. On March
31, 1776, Abigail Adams wrote a letter
to her husband, who was serving in the
Continental Congress.
She wrote:
I desire you would remember the ladies and
be more generous and favorable to them than
your ancestors. Do not put such an unlimited
power in the hands of the husbands. . . . If
particular care and attention is not paid to
the ladies, we are determined to foment a re-
bellion and will not hold ourselves bound by
any laws in which we have no voice or rep-
resentation.
I am sorry that our Founding Fa-
thers did not listen to Abigail Adams.
Over 144 years later, the 19th Amend-
ment was adopted to our Constitution,
providing for women’s suffrage. It
passed first in the House of Representa-
tives on May 21, 1919, and then in the
Senate on June 4, 1919.
The right to vote was the first step.
Over the last 100 years, we have seen
tremendous progress. Legally, finan-
cially, and socially, more women have
entered the workforce than ever before.
Women are filling key leadership posts
in increasing numbers, but we still
have an unfinished agenda for equality
for women.
I think most people in this country
would be surprised to learn that there
is nothing in the Constitution of the
United States that guarantees equal
rights for women. As the late Justice
Scalia said, there is nothing in the
Constitution that requires discrimina-
tion against women, but there is noth-
ing that protects women against dis-
crimination.
Senator MURKOWSKI and I introduced
S. Res. 6, which extends the date for
the ratification of the Equal Rights
Amendment. In 1972, we passed the
Equal Rights Amendment here for rati-
fication for the States and extended it
one time, and 10 years later, 35 States
had ratified the Equal Rights Amend-
ment—3 short of the required 38. Ne-
vada and Illinois have since ratified
the amendment, so it is one State
short. However, we need to pass the
resolution to extend the time limit.
As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has
said—and this is interesting—every
constitution written since the end of
World War II includes a provision that
men and women are citizens of equal
stature. Ours does not. It is well past
time that we passed the Equal Rights
Amendment.
The 27th Amendment to the Con-
stitution took over 200 years to ratify.
It deals with congressional pay in-
creases.
We can pass and should pass in this
Congress a fitting tribute to the cele-
bration of women’s suffrage—the Equal
Rights Amendment for women.
We need to do more for equal pay for
equal work. I acknowledge the extraor-
dinary leadership that we had in Mary-
land and this Nation in Senator Bar-
bara Mikulski. She was a true cham-
pion in so many ways—as a social
worker, as a city councilperson, as a
Member of the House of Representa-
tives, and as a U.S. Senator—in ad-
vancing rights for women, particularly
in the workplace. I remember, with
pride, seeing her stand next to Presi-
dent Obama as he signed his very first
bill, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act,
which enforced rights for women in the
workplace. As Senator Mikulski would
point out, we still have work to do. We
still have not passed equal pay for
equal work in this country, and this
Congress should deal with that.
We have a wealth gap. There is no
question that women do not have the
same wealth as men. In working with
Senator RUBIO on the committee on
which I serve as ranking member, the
Small Business and Entrepreneurship
Committee, we must look at whether
the tools of the Small Business Admin-
istration’s are providing help to women
to develop their own businesses.
Wealth is usually accumulated through
business growth, and we need to do
more to help women.
In the State of Maryland, I am proud
that 39 percent of our small businesses
are owned by women, but women do
not have equal access to the tools with
which to access capital. We can do bet-
ter with the 7(a) Program and with the
Community Advantage Pilot Program,
particularly in making it permanent.
So there are still steps we can take to
help advance equal rights and equal op-
portunity for women.
There is women’s healthcare. The
constitutional right of women to make
their own choices about their own
health and well-being is again being
challenged by some of our States and
here on Capitol Hill. Whether it is
abortion, preventive screening, or con-
traception, access to reproductive
healthcare provides women with great-
er economic opportunity. Treating
women as less than equal was wrong at
the start of our Nation, and it is wrong
today.
As we celebrate the 100th anniversary
of women’s suffrage, let us do several
things. First, I urge all of our col-
leagues to support the resolution that
is pending, S. Res. 212, in regard to
celebrating the women’s suffrage and,
second, that we work for full equality
for women in our Constitution, in the
workplace, in entrepreneurship, and in
healthcare.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am
pleased to yield to the Senator from
Minnesota, Ms. KLOBUCHAR.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota.
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I
thank my colleague, Senator CAPITO
from West Virginia, who, in the spirit
of today, has allowed me to take her
place, and she will go next.
I rise to join my colleagues to cele-
brate the centennial anniversary of the
19th Amendment. I thank Senator COL-
LINS and Senator FEINSTEIN for taking
the lead in bringing us together today.
Just think. One hundred years ago
today, the Senate voted to guarantee
and protect a woman’s constitutional
right to vote, marking an important
milestone in our democracy. My home
State of Minnesota was the 15th State
to ratify the 19th Amendment, and
women like Dr. Mary Jackman
Colburn, Sarah Burger Stearns, Clara
Ueland, and Sarah Tarleton Colvin
fought to make it happen.
By the way, on a historical note,
when President Wilson refused at first
to support a constitutional amendment
to grant women equal voting rights,
suffragists like Sarah Colvin of Min-
nesota chained themselves to the fence
of the White House and burned an ef-
figy of the President. After weeks of
similar protest fires and intense pres-
sure to support equal rights, he an-
nounced his support of a constitutional
amendment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3196 June 4, 2019
We also must remember, in addition
to people like Elizabeth Cady Stanton,
Lucretia Mott, and Susan B. Anthony,
the African-American suffragists who
were in the league—Harriet Tubman,
Ida B. Wells, Josephine St. Pierre
Ruffin, and Margaret Murray Wash-
ington.
The women’s suffrage movement en-
countered strong opposition. It doesn’t
feel like that would have happened
now, but it did back then, and those
who opposed equality came up with
creative reasons to keep women from
voting.
The National Association Opposed to
Woman Suffrage was a real organiza-
tion and published a pamphlet full of
propaganda. The pamphlet read that if
women were granted the right to vote,
some States would be under ‘‘petticoat
rule.’’ The pamphlet also provided a
list of household cleaning tips for
women, such as not needing a ballot to
clean out your sink spout and that
there is no method known by which a
mud-stained reputation may be cleaned
after bitter political campaigns. Post-
ers were scattered across cities that de-
picted men at home taking care of ba-
bies and cooking and cleaning because
they had been abandoned by their vot-
ing wives.
One hundred years later, I think we
can safely say that none of the dire
warnings described in the propaganda
came to pass and that the United
States of America did not perish under
the ‘‘petticoat rule.’’ What did happen
is, in 1920, in the first Federal election
in which women could vote, the total
popular vote increased dramatically
from 18.5 million to 26.8 million by 1920.
When I arrived in the Senate, there
were only 16 women, led by the dean of
the women Senators, who is here with
us today, Senator Barbara Mikulski.
As noted by my colleagues, we now
have 25 women Senators. That is an
alltime high because, when you look at
the history of the Senate, there have
been nearly 2,000 male Senators and
only 56 women. I was on the Trevor
Noah show a few months ago, and he
said that if a nightclub had that kind
of ratio, they would shut it down. Yet,
in fact, we are at an alltime high with
25 women Senators and with more to
come.
Someone once said that women
should speak softly and carry a big sta-
tistic. Well, I don’t agree with the
‘‘speak softly’’ part, but there is some
merit to the big statistic. Maybe be-
cause it was harder for them to get
where they are, I have found women
Senators to be accountable, to say
what they are going to do, and to get it
done. There was actually a study from
Harvard—the University of Minnesota
of the East—that showed that it was,
in fact, true.
My colleagues have mentioned the
challenges ahead. We have to make
sure that more people can vote and
that we don’t suppress votes. We need
to pass the Equal Rights Amendment.
We need to make sure that we have
equal pay. There are many, many chal-
lenges ahead.
We celebrate today because we all
stand on the shoulders of those before
us. In our case, we stand on the very
broad shoulders of our friend Barbara
Mikulski, who once said—and I still re-
member this—when we took up a wom-
an’s issue on the floor, to put on your
suits, square your shoulders, put on
your lipstick, and get ready for a revo-
lution. I don’t know what revolution
she was talking about, but hers was the
voice of those before us. We all stand
on their shoulders, and we are happy to
take up their torch.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine.
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield
to the Senator from West Virginia,
Mrs. CAPITO.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia.
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I thank
all of my colleagues, particularly my
colleague from Maine, Senator COL-
LINS, for her leadership on this issue
and many others.
It is great to be here with our former
colleague Senator Mikulski, who
taught me how to be tough on the Ap-
propriations Committee—if I could
only be that tough.
I join my colleagues today to com-
memorate and celebrate the centennial
anniversary of the 19th Amendment.
We all know the history—at least we
should—and we have talked a lot about
it today. We have heard the names in
documentaries and have read about
them in history books—Elizabeth Cady
Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Sojourner
Truth, and so many others. These suf-
fragists, these leaders paved the way
for women to exercise their right to
vote, changing history and the fabric of
our Nation in the process. I think it
goes without saying that this was no
small or easy feat. In fact, it was a
pretty tough fight, and it wasn’t won
overnight. It took a total of 9 years for
the amendment to reach the Senate
floor.
In 1887, the vote for suffrage was ac-
tually defeated—hard for us to imag-
ine. I think experiencing legislative de-
feat is something we all have experi-
ence with in this body. But that was
not the end. It certainly took too much
time, and things started to really heat
up around 1916. That year, the people of
Montana made the monumental move
of electing Jeannette Rankin to the
House of Representatives. Interestingly
enough, with a woman finally serving
in Congress, it didn’t seem so crazy
that a woman should be able to have a
say when it comes to who serves.
Eventually, the Senate passed the
resolution proposing the 19th Amend-
ment. The date was June 4, 1919, ex-
actly 100 years ago. I am proud to say
that both of West Virginia’s Senators
at the time, Senator Howard Suther-
land and Senator Davis Elkins, voted
in favor of the resolution—I would ex-
pect nothing more from tough moun-
taineer men—and that language was
adopted and ratified to the Constitu-
tion on August 18, 1920, marking the
moment that women were given the op-
portunity to have their voices heard at
the ballot box.
Finally, our country was acknowl-
edging that women had a voice and
that their voice was needed to be a part
of this democracy. Don’t get me
wrong—women were not instantly
made political equals of men over-
night, at least not in practice. Even
today, despite making up more than
half of the population, women do not
make up half of the Congress, and that
is something we are working hard on
every day. Over the years, thanks to
the pioneering efforts of the suffragists
and others who came before them, we
have made progress, yes, and we have
celebrated many victories, from the
very small to the very significant.
Just think, when I first came to Con-
gress in 2001—I saw my colleague from
Tennessee, but I don’t believe she was
here then—we had to work to just get
a woman’s restroom put in off the floor
of the House of Representatives.
Today, I am one of 127 women who have
the honor of serving our districts and
our States and our country in Con-
gress. That is the most women to ever
serve in the Congress. And across the
Nation, there are countless future lead-
ers. That is why I think this day is so
important.
I am very proud of the history my
home State of West Virginia has al-
ready made when it comes to having
women participate in our democracy.
In 1951, Elizabeth Kee of Bluefield
took the place of her husband, the Hon-
orable Congressman John Kee, to be
the first woman to represent West Vir-
ginia in the U.S. Congress.
I am also proud to say we have CAROL
MILLER—another woman—on the other
side representing our State.
Elizabeth Kee had been her husband’s
longtime secretary—which, by the way,
is not allowed today—and actually
stood up against party leaders who said
she should retain her position as sec-

didn’t listen to that, thank goodness.
When the 26th Amendment to the
Constitution was ratified in 1971,
changing the voting age from 21 to 18,
this was done at the dogged insistence
of my predecessor, Senator Jennings
Randolph. But a proud West Virginian,
Ella Mae Thompson Haddix, was the
first person in the United States of
America—a young woman from West
Virginia—to register to vote as an 18-
year-old.
I am very honored to be the first
woman to represent my State, and
many of us are that in our States. With
that honor, I feel a special obligation
to help the next generation of young
leaders. I started a program called
West Virginia Girls Rise Up, and with
that program, I travel and talk to fifth
grade girls, encouraging them to set
goals for themselves and then work to
achieve them. We talk about what it

means to be a leader in whatever ca-
reer or field they love or are passionate
about. My hope is that eventually
these girls will grow into engaged citi-
zens and leaders—not only women who
vote but women who aren’t afraid to
run for office or run a boardroom or
pursue a STEM career or anything else
they might desire.
The 19th Amendment—hard fought—
brought women more than just the
right to vote; in many ways, it gave us
women more courage to run, to advo-
cate, and to lead.
I thank my colleagues for taking
time today to celebrate the 19th
Amendment, to celebrate civic-minded
women, courageous women, and to cel-
ebrate that our country is stronger
now and will be stronger in the future
because women are voting and leading.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms.
MCSALLY). The Senator from Maine.
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, ear-
lier, I recognized Senator Barbara Mi-
kulski, an outstanding leader and
former colleague and member of the
Women’s Suffrage Centennial Commis-
sion. I also want to acknowledge that
there are other members of the Com-
mission who are here with us today. We
welcome them as they observe this de-
bate, and we thank them for their hard
work to make sure this significant oc-
casion is recognized.
It is now my great pleasure to yield
time to the Senator from Washington,
Senator CANTWELL.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington.
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I
thank the Senator from Maine for help-
ing us coordinate this very important
moment today, and I, too, want to rec-
ognize the presence of our former col-
league, who is playing such a great role
in helping us commemorate next year
as such a very important time for us to
recognize the important role of wom-
en’s voices in American politics.
I join my colleagues today to com-
memorate the 100th anniversary of the
Senate’s passing of the 19th Amend-
ment and to honor all the women who
struggled hard and long to make sure
our democracy included our voices, the
voices of all women, all those women
who saw the promise of the United
States and fought for their place in it.
Those women helped craft a more per-
fect union. For nearly a century, these
women fought to be heard, and their ef-
forts fundamentally transformed our
democracy and our country.
I am very proud to represent a State
with a long tradition of women activ-
ists and leaders. Today, I want to rec-
ognize two influential suffragists from
my State—Emma Smith DeVoe and
May Hutton. Both women were pio-
neers in the struggle to get the right to
vote. In an era when women were given
few opportunities, these two women re-
fused to be held back. They instead
paved a way for women to fully engage
in the political process.
Tacoma resident Emma Smith DeVoe
built the Washington Equal Suffrage
Association and led the successful cam-
paign to enshrine women’s suffrage in
Washington’s State Constitution a full
10 years ahead of the ratification of the
19th Amendment. She helped win the
right to vote for women in Idaho in
1896 and led campaigns in other States,
speaking and organizing rallies and sit-
ins, and she helped found the National
Council of Women Voters to continue
the nationwide suffrage movement and
educate newly enfranchised women
about politics across the country. Her
efforts got her the nickname ‘‘the
Mother of Woman’s Suffrage.’’
May Hutton, the other activist from
our State, overcame a very difficult
childhood. She and her husband became
successful entrepreneurs and devoted
much of their self-made wealth to ac-
tivism.
When they moved to Spokane from
Idaho in 1906, May actually lost her
right to vote in the process. She quick-
ly set out to work to change that injus-
tice and win the franchise for women in
every State in the territory.
She wrote:
Women should vote because they have the
intelligence to vote. They should vote be-
cause it gives them responsibilities, and re-
sponsibilities better fit women for all condi-
tions of life. Equality before the law gives
women a fair chance with men in a question
of wages for the same work.
There you go—a century ago, some-
one standing up for women to have the
same wage in work, and that is the
work we continue here today.
She continued:
In other words, the enfranchisement of
women means a square deal for all.
May stood tall for more than just
women’s rights; she proposed extending
the franchise to all adults, regardless
of sex, race, or color.
Washington’s territorial legislature
gave women the right to vote in 1883,
but it was struck down by the courts.
Because of the continuous efforts of
Ms. DeVoe, Ms. Hutton, and so many
others, women finally gained the fran-
chise in Washington in 1910—a full dec-
ade before this right was guaranteed
nationally. Emma Smith DeVoe and
May Hutton paved the way for so many
women. Washington State is proud of
their work, and we are proud of their
accomplishments.
As we honor them today, we must
also recognize that the struggle for
equal rights is still not over. We have
more to do. We know that our country
is stronger, more representative, and
more successful when we include
women at every table and in every
boardroom and at every ballot box and
in every discussion in our families and
in our communities, but we need to be
reminded of the example of Emma and
May so that other suffragists know
that we remember their work and are
grateful for it and that we are going to
continue the fight to get equal access
and equal representation in all issues
in the United States.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine.
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I
simply want to thank my colleagues
for their participation today in bring-
ing to the attention of the American
people that this truly is a historic oc-
casion, a date on which we celebrate
the Senate’s passage of the 19th
Amendment granting women a long-
overdue right to vote. I want to thank
all of my colleagues who participated
in the speeches. The history they
brought from their individual States
was fascinating indeed.
It is my understanding that we will
now move to pass commemorative coin
legislation introduced by the Senator
from Tennessee.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee.

Sixty-eight women and 32 men signed the
Declaration of Sentiments at the Convention
in July 1848.
(2) The Declaration of Sentiments was
modeled after the Declaration of Independ-
ence and declared that ‘‘all men and women
are created equal’’, linking women’s rights
directly to the founding ideals of the United
States.
(3) Suffrage activists, including Elizabeth
Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Harriet
Tubman, Sojourner Truth, Ida B. Wells,
Jovita Idar, Inez Millholland, Mary Church
Terrell, Anne Dallas Dudley, Carrie Chap-
man Cat, Alice Paul, Lucy Burns, Esther Ho-
bart Morris, and many others, conducted
over 900 local, State, and Federal campaigns
over a 72-year time span to win women the
right to vote.
(4) On November 6, 1917, New York granted
women the right to vote, which was an act
that created momentum for the national
movement that culminated in the ratifica-
tion of the 19th Amendment to the Constitu-
tion of the United States 3 years later.
(5) The 19th Amendment to the Constitu-
tion of the United States (‘‘The Susan B. An-
thony Amendment’’) guarantees all United
States women the right to vote and was
passed by the 66th Congress of the United
States on June 4, 1919.
(6) On August 9, 1920, right before the rati-
fication period was set to expire, Governor
Albert H. Roberts called a special session of
the Tennessee General Assembly to consider
the amendment. Pro-suffrage and anti-suf-
frage activists from around the country de-
scended on Nashville, Tennessee, intent on
influencing the legislature.
(7) After the amendment was defeated in a
48–48 tie vote, Tennessee State Representa-
tive Harry T. Burn from McMinn County
cast the deciding favorable vote after receiv-
ing a note from his mother, Phoebe
Ensminger Burn, imploring him to vote yes
for ratification.
(8) On August 18, 1920, Tennessee became
the 36th and final State needed to pass the
19th Amendment, ensuring its ratification
pursuant to Article V of the Constitution of
the United States.
(9) The 19th Amendment was ratified on
August 26, 1920, when Secretary of State
Bainbridge Colby issued a proclamation an-
nouncing it has become part of the Constitu-
tion of the United States.

NOMINATION OF ANDREW M. SAUL
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I oppose the nomination of An-
drew Saul to be Commissioner of So-
cial Security. I am deeply concerned
about the treatment of unions who rep-
resent workers at the Social Security
Administration, and Mr. Saul declined
to give meaningful assurances that
anything will change under his leader-
ship. Americans everywhere count on
the Federal employees of the Social Se-
curity Administration to ensure fair-
ness and efficiency in the benefits pro-
vided by Social Security for retirees,
people with disabilities, and surviving
spouses and dependents.
The Social Security Administration
demonstrated particular hostility to-
wards its workforce in the way it im-
plemented Executive orders that were
issued by President Trump on May 25,
2018, which would have undermined
lawful civil service protections. De-
spite a court order striking down sig-
nificant portions of these Executive or-
ders, management at the Social Secu-
rity Administration has continued to
insist on positions in collective bar-
gaining agreements that closely mirror
the invalidated Executive orders. The
Federal Service Impasses Panel re-
cently imposed a contract on one of the
unions representing Social Security
workers that hews closely to the Exec-
utive orders, including provisions to
deny the union use of office space in
government buildings and slash the of-
ficial time available to the union to
fulfill their statutory duties to rep-
resent workers.
When asked about these attacks on
the rights of Social Security workers,
Mr. Saul provided only vague state-
ments that included no commitments
to take meaningful action to improve
labor practices at Social Security.
Workers at the Social Security Admin-
istration and the American people who
are counting on Social Security de-
serve better, and I hope Mr. Saul will
prove me wrong by proactively engag-
ing with his workforce and reversing
the damage that has been done.

EXPRESSING THE GRATITUDE AND
APPRECIATION OF THE SENATE
FOR THE ACTS OF HEROISM AND
VALOR BY THE MEMBERS OF

FORCES WHO PARTICIPATED IN
THE JUNE 6, 1944, AMPHIBIOUS
LANDING AT NORMANDY,
FRANCE
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the consideration of Cal-
endar No. 98, S. Res. 135.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will report the resolution by
title.
The legislative clerk read as follows:
A resolution (S. Res. 135) expressing the
gratitude and appreciation of the Senate for
the acts of heroism and valor by the mem-
bers of the United States Armed Forces who
participated in the June 6, 1944, amphibious
landing at Normandy, France, and com-
mending those individuals for leadership and
bravery in an operation that helped bring an
end to World War II.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection to proceeding to the meas-
ure?
There being no objection, the Senate
proceeded to consider the resolution
which had been reported from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, without
amendment, and with an amendment
to the preamble, as follows:
Whereas June 6, 2019, marks the 75th anniver-
sary of the Allied assault at Normandy, France,
by troops of the United States, the United King-
dom, Canada, and Free France, known as ‘‘Op-
eration Overlord’’;
Whereas, before Operation Overlord, the Ger-
man Army still occupied France and the Nazi
government still had access to the raw materials
and industrial capacity of Western Europe;
Whereas the naval phase of the Allied assault
at Normandy was code-named ‘‘Operation Nep-
tune’’, and the date of June 6, 1944, is referred
to as ‘‘D-Day’’ to denote the day on which the
combat attack was initiated;
Whereas the D-Day landing was the largest
combined arms amphibious assault in history,
consisting of—
(1) approximately 132,600 members of the Al-
lied Expeditionary Force, including 57,500 mem-
bers of the United States Armed Forces;
(2) more than 23,000 airborne troops sup-
porting the seaborne landings;
(3) approximately 7,000 naval vessels; and
(4) more than 14,000 sorties by Allied aircraft;
Whereas soldiers of 6 divisions (3 from the
United States, 2 from the United Kingdom,
which included troops of Free France, and 1
from Canada) and 3 British armored brigades
stormed ashore in 5 main landing areas on
beaches in Normandy, which were code-named
‘‘Utah’’, ‘‘Omaha’’, ‘‘Gold’’, ‘‘Juno’’, and
‘‘Sword’’;
Whereas, of the approximately 10,000 Allied
casualties incurred on the first day of the land-
ing, more than 6,000 were members of the United
States Armed Forces;
Whereas the Allied assault and following op-
erations were supported by ships, aircraft, and
troops from Australia, Belgium, Czechoslovakia,
Free Norway, Greece, the Netherlands, New
Zealand, and the Polish Armed Forces in the
West;
Whereas the advanced age of the last remain-
ing veterans of, and the gradual disappearance
of any living memory of, World War II and the
Normandy landings make it necessary to in-
crease activities intended to pass on the history
of those events, particularly to younger genera-
tions;
Whereas the young people of Normandy and
the United States have displayed unprecedented
commitment to, and involvement in, cele-
brating—
(1) the veterans of the Normandy landings;
and
(2) the freedom brought by those veterans in
1944;
Whereas the significant material remains of
the Normandy landings found on the Normandy
beaches and at the bottom of the sea in the ter-
ritorial waters of France, such as shipwrecks
and various items of military equipment, bear
witness to the remarkable and unique nature of
the material resources used by the Allied forces
to execute the Normandy landings;
Whereas 5 Normandy beaches and a number
of sites on the Normandy coast, including
Pointe du Hoc, were the scene of the D-Day
landings and constitute, and will for all time
constitute—
(1) a unique piece of world heritage; and
(2) a symbol of peace and freedom, the
unspoilt nature, integrity, and authenticity of
which must be protected at all costs; and
Whereas the world owes a debt of gratitude to
the members of the ‘‘Greatest Generation’’ who
assumed the task of freeing the world from Nazi
and Fascist regimes and restoring liberty to Eu-
rope: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) recognizes the 75th anniversary of the
amphibious landing of the Allies on D-Day,
June 6, 1944, at Normandy, France, during
World War II;
(2) expresses gratitude and appreciation to
the members of the United States Armed
Forces who participated in the D-Day oper-
ations;
(3) thanks the young people of Normandy
and the United States for their involvement
in events celebrating the 75th anniversary of
the Normandy landings with the aim of mak-
ing future generations aware of the acts of
heroism and sacrifice performed by the Al-
lied forces;
(4) recognizes the efforts of France and the
people of Normandy to preserve for future
generations the unique world heritage rep-
resented by the Normandy beaches and the
sunken material remains of the Normandy
landings by inscribing those beaches and re-
mains on the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (com-
monly referred to as ‘‘UNESCO’’) World Her-
itage List; and
(5) requests that the President issue a
proclamation calling on the people of the
United States to observe the 75th anniver-
sary of the Normandy landings with appro-
priate ceremonies and programs to honor the
sacrifices made by their fellow countrymen
to liberate Europe.
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous
consent that the resolution be agreed
to, the committee-reported amendment
to the preamble be agreed to, the pre-
amble, as amended, be agreed to, and
the motions to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

The committee-reported amendment

75TH ANNIVERSARY OF D-DAY
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President,
tomorrow, a number of us will be trav-
eling from Washington to France, to
Normandy, for the 75th anniversary of
D-Day on Thursday. We will commemo-
rate the heroic, selfless efforts of a cou-
rageous group of Allied forces, and we
will honor all of our World War II vet-
erans.
The 156,000 Americans and British
and Canadian troops who stormed the
beaches of Normandy, France, on that
fateful day, June 6, 1944, turned the
tide to win the war in Europe.
Launched from England, the Allies’
landing in France was carefully
planned and really brilliantly exe-
cuted. In his D-Day message to the
troops, General Dwight David Eisen-
hower instilled confidence. His message
was this:
The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving
people everywhere march with you.
In company with our brave Allies and
brothers-in-arms on other fronts, you will
bring about the destruction of the German
war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyr-
anny over the oppressed peoples of Europe,
and security for ourselves in a free world.
That was the message from General
Eisenhower.
Well, because of the tremendous sac-
rifices of our Allied forces, Nazi Ger-
many surrendered unconditionally less
than a year later, on May 7, 1945.
The price for European peace and se-
curity proved high. In all, there were
4,414 Allied deaths on D-Day alone, and
2,501 Americans were killed that day.
Allied deaths in the Battle of Nor-
mandy, which lasted until August,
topped 226,000.
Now, 75 years later, thousands of vet-
erans and world leaders will gather on
this hallowed ground to honor the self-
sacrificing soldiers who fought for our
freedom.
My home State of Wyoming lost five
of its finest sons on D-Day. I want to
recognize these heroes who never made
it home: Private Raymond Dahlman,
PFC Thompson Dicks, Private Thomas
Offutt, Jr., PFC Steven Serkovich, and
Private Jack Simpson.
I also salute Wyoming’s 602 living
World War II veterans, including my
wife Bobbie’s father, Bob Brown of
Thermopolis, WY, who served not only
in World War II in Europe and then was
sent to the Pacific, but he was also
called up to serve our Nation once
again in the Korean war.
In all, 16 million Americans fought in
World War II; more than 400,000 U.S.
servicemembers were killed in the war;
and most of those who returned home
have now passed away.
So today I want to highlight one of
my home State’s D-Day heroes who
died 5 years ago at the age of 92: SSG
Chester ‘‘Chet’’ Stephens of Glenrock,
WY.
Chet was born in Casper, WY, in 1911
and moved with his family to a ranch
south of Glenrock.
At 21, he was called to serve in the
Army in World War II, joining the 161st
Field Artillery Battalion. Chet sup-
plied ammunition to the battery
throughout the war. The 161st landed
in Normandy’s Omaha Beach in the
third wave and fought the Nazis for
months.
Chet was awarded the Bronze Star for
his heroism in crossing a flooded road
to deliver ammunition to his stranded
comrades.
His battalion stopped only 7 miles
from Berlin, Germany, before he re-
turned home to Glenrock and to his
lifelong love of family ranching. In
fact, he was still ranching at the age of
92 when he died in 2014.
So I will be thinking of Wyoming’s D-
Day heroes and all of our State’s World
War II veterans during the tribute at
Normandy.
I will also be thinking of my dad. He
was part of the liberation of France,
fighting in the pivotal Battle of the
Bulge.
I will carry his dog tags with me
when I go overseas, the dog tags that
he wore during World War II in the lib-
eration of France.
I will also carry with me the medal
that was given to the brave soldiers
who fought in the liberation of France.
The medal says ‘‘1944.’’ There is a chain
around France with breaks in the
chain, and on the back, it says ‘‘la
France’’; it says ‘‘liberateurs’’—the lib-
eration of France.
I will also have with me the missal
he carried, his prayer book. It says: My
military missal. There is a crucifix on
the front and on the back, a rosary, the
crucifix, and then the beads that were
elevated in the printing so that one
could, in a foxhole, in a time of war,
with this in your pocket, pray to your
Lord and God.
You know, from the time I was a lit-
tle boy, my dad would always say:
John, you should thank God every day
because you live in America. You don’t
know how fortunate you are.
We are truly blessed to live in this
great country, and it is due to the self-
less actions of our troops—those brave
soldiers who risked their lives—and
many gave their lives for the rest of us.
As President Franklin Roosevelt said
in his D-Day prayer: ‘‘Almighty God:
Our sons, pride of our Nation, this day
have set upon a mighty endeavor, a
struggle to preserve our Republic, our
religion, and our civilization.’’
We must never forget those who
fought for our freedoms. So many gave
their lives to protect our way of life.
We owe an incredible debt of grati-
tude to our Gold Star families and the
sacrifices of those families and of their
loved ones.
So on the 75th anniversary of D-Day,
it is a time to remember all of our
brave service men and women, to re-
flect on their faithful service to this
country, and to recall the sacrifices
that they have made and continue to
make in defense of this great Nation.
Let me close by saying God bless our
troops who fought and died in World

(U) MEMORANDUM OF JUSTIFICATION FOR EMER-
GENCY ARMS TRANSFERS AND AUTHORIZA-
TIONS TO THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA, THE
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, AND THE HASHEMITE
KINGDOM OF JORDAN TO DETER IRANIAN MA-
LIGN INFLUENCE
(U) Iranian malign activity poses a funda-
mental threat to the stability of the Middle
East and to American security at home and
abroad. Iran’s actions have led directly to
the deaths of over six hundred U.S. military
personnel in Iraq, untold suffering in Syria,
and significant threats to Israeli security. In
Yemen, Iran helps fuel a conflict creating
the world’s greatest humanitarian crisis.
Iran directed repeated attacks on civilian
and military infrastructure in Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates by Iranian-de-
signed explosives-laden drones and ballistic
missiles fired by the Houthis, also known as
Ansar Allah, who receive financial, tech-
nical, and materiel support from Iran.
(U) Current threat reporting indicates Iran
engages in preparations for further malign
activities throughout the Middle East re-
gion, including potential targeting of U.S.
and allied military forces in the region. As
the Administration publicly noted and
briefed to Congress in greater detail in the
appropriate setting, a number of troubling
and escalatory indications and warnings
from the Iranian regime have prompted an
increased U.S. force posture in the region.
The Iran-backed Houthis publicly threatened
to increase operations targeting vital mili-
tary targets in the United Arab Emirates,
Saudi Arabia, and Saudi-Led Coalition posi-
tions in Yemen. The rapidly-evolving secu-
rity situation in the region requires an ac-
celerated delivery of certain capabilities to
U.S. partners in the region.
(U) As President Trump noted in National
Security Memorandum 11 of May 8, 2018,
‘‘the actions and policies of the Government
of Iran, including its proliferation and devel-
opment of missiles and other asymmetric
and conventional weapons capabilities, its
network and campaign of regional aggres-
sion, its support for terrorist groups, and the
malign activities of the Islamic Revolu-
tionary Guard Corps and its surrogates con-
tinue to pose an unusual and extraordinary
threat to the national security, foreign pol-
icy, and economy of the United States.’’
(U) Iran’s actions pose a critical threat to
regional stability and the national security
of the United States, which has been long ac-
knowledged. Since 1984, Iran remains des-
ignated by the United States as a State
Sponsor of Terrorism pursuant to section 6(j)
of the Export Administration Act, section 40
of the Arms Export Control Act, and section
620A of the Foreign Assistance Act. In addi-
tion, the recent designation of Iran’s Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a For-
eign Terrorist Organization under section 219
of the Immigration and Nationality Act
notes the Government of Iran, through the
IRGC-Quds Force, provides material support

to the Taliban, Lebanese Hizballah, Hamas,
Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-Gen-
eral Command (PFLP-GC). Iran is also iden-
tified as constituting an unusual and ex-
traordinary threat to the national security,
foreign policy and economy of the United
States under Executive Orders dating back
to the Carter and Clinton Administrations.
(U) In 2014, the Houthis, an Iran-supported
force increasingly contributing to the Ira-
nian regime’s efforts to destabilize the Ara-
bian Peninsula, attempted to overthrow the
internationally recognized government of
Yemen. The Houthis have greatly increased
regional instability, threatened the global
economy, destroyed infrastructure, and ter-
rorized the Yemeni people.
(U) The Houthis have attacked civilian
areas within Saudi Arabia and the UAE with
ballistic missile and unmanned aerial vehicle
attacks in addition to cross-border raids;
these have resulted in the deaths of over five
hundred Saudi civilians, and the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia was fortunate in 2017 to have
intercepted a ballistic missile aimed at
Mecca which could have led to a regional
conflagration.
(U) The Houthi threat to stability extends
beyond the security of their immediate
neighbors. Over 10% of global shipping passes
through the Bab-el-Mandeb straits sepa-
rating Yemen from Africa, including an esti-
mated 4.8 million barrels of oil per day, or
about 5% of the global oil trade. Since 2016,
the Houthis have repeatedly targeted inter-
national shipping transiting these straits to
or from the Suez Canal. Houthi-controlled
media recently announced the Houthis’ in-
tent to target Saudi ARAMCO infrastruc-
ture. Utilizing anti-ship cruise missiles,
small boat attacks, and remote-controlled
explosive vessels, the Houthis continue to
strike not only commercial oil tankers, but
also struck a cargo ship carrying grain to a
Yemeni port. The Houthis conducted mari-
time attacks on the USS Mason and the USS
Ponce, demonstrating the direct nature of
the Houthi threat to U.S. personnel, assets,
and our national security.
(U) Within Yemen, the Houthis severely
limited the ability of the international com-
munity to provide humanitarian assistance
to the population under their control. Inter-
national humanitarian organizations report
the ‘‘Houthi forces’ widespread use of land-
mines along Yemen’s western coast since
mid-2017 has killed and injured hundreds of
civilians and prevented aid groups from
reaching vulnerable communities.’’ Despite
the humanitarian catastrophe, the Houthis
continue to escalate the conflict in Yemen,
most recently disregarding their own com-
mitments under the UN-sponsored ceasefire
deal regarding the port city of Hudaydah.
(U) The United States strongly backs peace
efforts brokered by UN Special Envoy Martin
Griffiths. Griffiths’ painstaking endeavor to
have parties reach agreements in peace talks
in Sweden in 2018 would lay a solid track for
a political process to end the conflict.
(U) For the reasons cited above, an emer-
gency exists requiring immediate provision
of certain defense systems to Saudi Arabia,
the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan in the
national security interest of the United
States. Such transfers, whether provided via
the Foreign Military Sales system, or
through the licensing of Direct Commercial
Sales, must occur as quickly as possible in
order to deter further Iranian adventurism
in the Gulf and throughout the Middle East.
The Secretary of State, therefore, has cer-
tified an emergency exists under sections
36(b)(l), 36(c)(2), and 36(d)(2) of the Arms Ex-
port Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2776, thereby
waiving the congressional review require-
ments of those provisions.

zation equipment, spare and repair parts,
support equipment, tools and test equip-
ment, technical data and publications, per-
sonnel training and training equipment, U.S.
government and contractor engineering,
technical, and logistics support services, and
other related elements of logistics support.
The estimated cost was $3.5 billion. Major
Defense Equipment (MDE) constituted $1.68
billion of this total.
This transmittal reports:
1. the addition of thirty (30) Radar Elec-
tronic Units (REU) as MDE, which were in-
cluded in the total value of the original
transmittal, but were not properly identified
as MDE; and
2. the inclusion of additional quantities of
the following items: one (1) new AH–64E
Apache Attack Helicopter, six (6) T700–GE–
701D engines (2 installed, 4 spares), one (1)
new AN/ASQ–170 Modernized Target Acquisi-
tion and Designation Sight/AN/AAR–11 Mod-
ernized Pilot Night Vision Sensor, one (1)

tem, sixty-two (62) Embedded Global Posi-
tioning Systems with Inertial Navigation
(EGIs) (60 remanufactured, 2 new), and one
(1) new Manned-Unmanned Teaming-Inter-
national (MUMTi) system. The total MDE
value of these items is $101,518,591. The addi-
tion will not add to the total notified value
of MDE, which will remain $1.68 billion. The
total notified case value will remain $3.5 bil-
lion.
(iv) Significance: This notification is being
provided to report the inclusion of MDE and
non-MDE items that were not included in
the original notification. The UAE lost a hel-
icopter during recent operations and has re-
quested to replace this loss.
(v) Justification: The Secretary of State
has determined and provided detailed jus-
tification that an emergency exists that re-
quires the immediate sale to the United Arab
Emirates of the above defense articles (and
defense services) in the national security in-
terests of the United States, thereby waiving
the Congressional review requirements under
Section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control
Act, as amended. This equipment will sup-
port the capabilities of UAE’s Apache fleet
and enhance interoperability with the
United States.
(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The AH–64E
Apache Attack Helicopter weapon system
contains communications and target identi-
fication equipment, navigation equipment,
aircraft survivability equipment, displays,
and sensors. The airframe itself does not
contain sensitive technology; however, the
pertinent equipment listed below will be ei-
ther installed on the aircraft or included in
the sale:
a. The Radar Electronic Unit (REU) is a
component upgrade to the AN/APO–78 Fire
Control Radar (FCR). The REU replaces two
legacy Line Replaceable Units (Program-
mable Signal Processor and Low Power
Radio Frequency), achieving a weight reduc-
tion of approximately 85 pounds, with im-
proved reliability, increased processing
power, growth for new modes/capabilities
and replacement of obsolete components.
Critical system information is stored in the
FCR/REU in the form of mission executable
code, target detection, classification algo-
rithms and coded threat parametric. This in-
formation is provided in a form that cannot
be extracted by the foreign user via anti-
tamper provisions built into the system.
b. The AN/APG–78 Fire Control Radar
(FCR) is an active, low probability of inter-
cept, millimeter-wave radar, combined with
a passive AN/APR–48B Modernized Radar
Frequency Interferometer (M–RFI) mounted
on top of the helicopter mast. The FCR
Ground Targeting Mode detects, locates,
classifies and prioritizes stationary or mov-
ing armored vehicles, tanks and mobile air
defense systems as well as hovering heli-
copters, helicopters, and fixed wing aircraft
in normal flight. If desired, the radar data
can be used to refer targets to the regular
electro-optical Modernized Target Acquisi-
tion and Designation Sight (MTADS). This
information is provided in a form that can-
not be extracted by the foreign user. The
content of these items is classified SECRET.
User Data Module (UDM) on the RFI proc-
essor, contains the Radio Frequency threat
library. The UDM, which is a hardware as-
semblage, is classified CONFIDENTIAL when
programmed with threat parameters, threat
priorities and/or techniques derived from
U.S. intelligence information.
c. The AN/ASQ–170 Modernized Target Ac-
quisition and Designation Sight/AN/AAQ–11
Pilot Night Vision Sensor (MTADS/PNVS)
provides day, night, and limited adverse
weather target information, as well as night
navigation capabilities. The PNVS provides
thermal imaging that permits nap-of-the-
earth flight to, from, and within the battle
area, while TADS provides the co-pilot gun-
ner with search, detection, recognition, and
designation by means of Direct View Optics
(DVO), EI2 television, and Forward Looking
Infrared (FLIR) sighting systems that may
be used singularly or in combinations. Hard-
ware is UNCLASSIFIED. Technical manuals
for authorized maintenance levels are UN-
CLASSIFIED. Reverse engineering is not a
major concern.
d. The AAR–57 Common Missile Warning
System (CMWS) detects energy emitted by
threat missiles in-flight, evaluates potential
false alarm emitters in the environment, de-
clares validity of threat and selects appro-
priate countermeasures. The CMWS consists
of an Electronic Control Unit (ECU), Electro-
Optic Missile Sensors (EOMSs), and Se-
quencer and Improved Countermeasures Dis-
penser (ICMD). The ECU hardware is classi-
fied CONFIDENTIAL; releasable technical
manuals for operation and maintenance are
classified SECRET.

two EGIs which use internal accelerometers,
rate gyro measurements, and external sensor
measurements to estimate the aircraft state,
provides aircraft flight and position data to
aircraft systems. The EGI is a velocity-
aided, strap down, ring laser gyro based iner-
tial unit. The EGI unit houses a GPS re-
ceiver. The receiver is capable of operating
in either non-encrypted or encrypted. When
keyed, the GPS receiver will automatically
use anti-spoof/jam capabilities when they are
in use. The EGI will retain the key through
power on/off/on cycles. Because of safeguards
built into the EGI, it is not considered clas-
sified when keyed. Integrated within the EGI
is an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for
processing functions. Each EGI also houses a
Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR). The MMR is in-
corporated to provide for reception of ground
based NAVAID signals for instrument aided
flight. Provides IMC I IFR integration and
certification of improved Embedded Global
Positioning System and Inertial (EGI) unit,
with attached MMR, with specific cockpit
instrumentation allows Apaches to operate
within the worldwide IFR route structure.
Also includes integration of the Common
Army Aviation Map (CAAM), Area Naviga-
tion (RNAV), Digital Aeronautical Flight In-
formation File (DAFIF) and Global Air Traf-
fic Management (GATM) compliance.
f. Manned-Unmanned Teaming-Inter-
national (MUMT–I) provides Manned-Un-
manned Teaming with Unmanned Aerial
Systems (UASs), other Apaches and other
interoperable aircraft and land platforms.
Provides ability to display real-time UAS
sensor information to aircraft and transmit
MTADS video. Capability to receive video
and metadata from Interoperability Profile
compliant (IOP) as well as legacy systems. It
is a data link for the AH–64E that provides a
fully integrated multiband, interoperable ca-
pability that allows pilots to receive off-
board sensor video streaming from different
platforms in non-Tactical Common Data
Link (TCDL) bands. The MUMT–I data link
can retransmit UAS or Apache Modernized
Target Acquisition Designation Sight full-
motion sensor video and metadata to an-
other MUMT–I-equipped Apache. It can also
transmit to ground forces equipped with the
One Station Remote Video Terminal. It pro-
vides Apache aircrews with increased situa-
tional awareness and net-centric interoper-
ability while significantly reducing sensor-
to-shooter timelines. This combination re-
sults in increased survivability of Apache
aircrews and ground forces by decreasing
their exposure to hostile fire.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION
United Arab Emirates (UAE)—RQ–21A
Blackjack Unmanned Air Vehicles
The Government of the UAE has requested
to buy twenty (20) RQ–21A Blackjack Un-
manned Air Vehicles (UAVs). Also included
are forty (40) Global Positioning Systems
(GPS) with Selective Availability Anti-
Spoofing Module (SAASM) Type II (MPE–S);
air vehicle support equipment including
eight (8) Ground Control Stations (GCS),
four (4) launchers, and four (4) retrievers;
spare and repair parts; publications; train-
ing; and technical support services. The esti-
mated total case value is $80 million.
The Secretary of State has determined and
provided detailed justification that an emer-
gency exists that requires the immediate
sale to the United Arab Emirates of the
above defense articles (and defense services)
in the national security interests of the
United States, thereby waiving the Congres-
sional review requirements under Section
36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act, as
amended.
This proposed sale will contribute to the
foreign and national security of the United
States by improving the security of an im-
portant ally in the Middle East. This sale is
consistent with U.S. national security objec-
tives of assisting the UAE in developing and
maintaining a strong and ready self-defense
capability and enhancing interoperability
with U.S. forces. The UAE will have no dif-
ficulty absorbing these UAVs into its armed
forces.
The proposed sale of this equipment and
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.
The prime contractor will be Insitu,
Bingen, WA, a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Boeing Company. There are no known
offset agreements proposed in connection
with this potential sale.
Implementation of this proposed sale will
require multiple trips by U.S. Government
and contractor representatives to participate
in program and technical reviews plus train-
ing and maintenance support in country, on
a temporary basis, for a period of twenty-
four (24) months. It will also require one (1)
contractor representative to reside in coun-
try for a period of two (2) years to support
this program.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.

Arms Export Control Act
Annex Item No. vii
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
1. The following components and technical
documentation for the program are classified
as listed below:
a. The RQ–21 unmanned aircraft system
(UAS) is a runway-independent, modular un-
manned aircraft system that is designed for
a variety of missions. The RQ–21 UAS has
four subsystems: RQ–21A air vehicle (AV),
launcher, retriever, and ground control sta-
tions (GCS).
1) The RQ–2IA AV is a fixed-wing, single
engine AV remotely controlled by an oper-
ator via the GCS.
2) The launcher is a pneumatically-con-
trolled launch device that accelerates the
RQ–2IA AV to flying speed.
3) The retriever is a hydraulically-con-
trolled telescoping crane that captures the
RQ–21A AV at the end of the flight.
4) The GCS is a workstation that is used to
plan missions, control and monitor the RQ–
21A AV, and manage the data received from
the air vehicle.
b. The RQ–21 UAS is capable of transport
via ground, air, or ship. The RQ–21 UAS per-
forms a wide variety of reconnaissance, in-
telligence, and special missions. Operation-
ally or tactically vital data may be obtained
cost-effectively by exploiting the UAS mis-
sion systems and payload options. The RQ–
21A AV is designed to perform air reconnais-
sance (AR) based missions. It is equipped to
carry a forward turret to support the pri-
mary mission of reconnaissance and an as-
sortment of specialized, mission specific,
payloads within the center payload bay. The
Electro Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) Imager
Counter Countermeasures sensor ball is the
Alticam 11 EOIR4, which provides excep-
tional day/night capability in a small, light-
weight, low power solution, or the EOIR5
which adds a laser designator capability. It
uses mid-wave infrared (MWIR) electro-opti-
cal image, a gyrostabilized gimbal system,
has multiple operating modes, is compatible
with the Alticam video processing board
(AVS), and has a laser pointer and range-
finder. It is designed for small unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs), and is also used on
piloted airplanes, blimps, ground vehicles,
and unmanned surface vehicles.
c. The imagery and electronic reconnais-
sance functions of the RQ–21A AV support in-
telligence functions and operational
warfighting missions. Intelligence-based sup-
port functions range from intelligence, sur-
veillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) to intel-
ligence preparation of the battlefield (IPB)
including imagery associated sub-tasks.
Operational functions are enhanced by a
laser rangefinder and infrared marking sys-
tem. The turret, with laser system, facili-
tates target acquisition and terminal guid-
ance operations in support of a wide breadth
of aviation support to MAGTF operations
mission. These include but are not limited to
point, area, and route reconnaissance; con-
voy escort; call for indirect fires; battle dam-
age assessment; and tactical recovery of air-
craft and personnel. The aircraft also pas-
sively supports radio communications relay
and the vessel traffic function of automatic
identification.
d. The GCS includes an operator work sta-
tion (OWS), a ground data terminal for C2
communication and video downlink, and a
GPS electronics module (GEM) integration
kit for navigation. The GCS is composed of a
standard component package. If installed on
a ship, the GCS will be composed of the same
components as the land based system, but
the number and arrangement of each of the
components will vary depending on the spe-
cific class of ship on which the GCS is in-
stalled. The RQ–21 GCS is comprised of the
following components:
1) Two operator work stations. The OWS
consist of four modules: electronics power
module (EPM), network computer module
(NCM), user interface module (UIM), and the
data storage module (DSM). The EPM pro-
vides the power source for the GCS. The
EPM is the bottom module in the OWS. The
UIM is not installed in the GCS for ship-
based operations.
2) Ground data terminal. The GDT includes
the antenna interface module (AIM), direc-
tional antenna, and omni antennas (for ship-
board operations only). The AIM models are
different between land and ship-based con-
figurations.

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
1. The Javelin Weapon System is a me-
dium-range, man portable, shoulder-
launched, fire and forget, anti-tank system
for infantry, scouts, and combat engineers.
It may also be mounted on a variety of plat-
forms including vehicles, aircraft and
watercraft. The system weighs 49.5 pounds
and has a maximum range in excess of 2,500
meters. The system is highly lethal against
tanks and other systems with conventional
and reactive armors, The system possesses a
secondary capability against bunkers.
2. Javelin’s key technical feature is the use
of fire-and-forget technology which allows
the gunner to fire and immediately relocate
or take cover. Additional special features are
the top attack and/or direct fire modes, an
advanced tandem warhead and imaging in-
frared seeker, target lock-on before launch,
and soft launch from enclosures or covered
fighting positions. The Javelin missile also
has a minimum smoke motor thus decreas-
ing its detection on the battlefield.
3. The Javelin Weapon System is com-
prised of two major tactical components,
which are a reusable Command Launch Unit
(CLU) and a round contained in a disposable
launch tube assembly. The CLU incorporates
an integrated day-night sight that provides a
target engagement capability in adverse
weather and countermeasure environments.
The CLU may also be used in a stand-alone
mode for battlefield surveillance and target
detection. The CLU’s thermal sight is a sec-
ond generation Forward Looking Infrared
(FLIR) sensor. To facilitate initial loading
and subsequent updating of software, all on-
board missile software is uploaded via the
CLU after mating and prior to launch.
4. The missile is autonomously guided to
the target using an imaging infrared seeker
and adaptive correlation tracking algo-
rithms. This allows the gunner to take cover
or reload and engage another target after fir-
ing a missile. The missile has an advanced
tandem warhead and can be used in either
the top attack or direct fire modes (for tar-
get undercover). An onboard flight computer
guides the missile to the selected target.
5. The Javelin Missile System hardware
and the documentation are UNCLASSIFIED.
The missile software which resides in the
CLU is considered SENSITIVE. The sensi-
tivity is primarily in the software programs
which instruct the system how to operate in
the presence of countermeasures. The overall
hardware is also considered sensitive in that
the infrared wavelengths could be useful in
attempted countermeasure development.
6. If a technologically advanced adversary
were to obtain knowledge of specific hard-
ware, the information could be used to de-
velop countermeasures which might reduce
weapons system effectiveness or be used in
the development of a system with similar or
advanced capabilities.
7. A determination has been made that the
United Arab Emirates can provide substan-
tially the same degree of protection for sen-
sitive technology being released as the U.S.
Government. This proposed sustainment pro-
gram is necessary to the furtherance of the
U.S. foreign policy and national security ob-
jectives outlined in the policy justification.
8. All defense articles and services listed in
this transmittal are authorized for release
and export to the Government of United
Arab Emirates.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION
United Arab Emirates (UAE)—Advanced
Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS)
The Government of the United Arab Emir-
ates has requested a possible sale of twenty
thousand four (20,004) Advanced Precision
Kill Weapon Systems (APKWS) II All-Up-
Rounds. Also included is weapon support and
test equipment, spares, technical publica-
tions, personnel training, other training
equipment, transportation, U.S. Government
and contractor engineering, technical and lo-
gistics support services, and other related
elements of logistical and program support.
The estimated total case value is $900 mil-
lion.
The Secretary of State has determined and
provided detailed justification that an emer-
gency exists that requires the immediate
sale to the United Arab Emirates of the
above defense articles (and defense services)
in the national security interests of the
United States, thereby waiving the Congres-
sional review requirements under Section
36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act, as

This proposed sale will contribute to the
foreign policy and national security of the
United States by improving the security of
an important partner in the region. This sale
is consistent with U.S. initiatives to provide
key partners in the region with modern sys-
tems that will enhance interoperability with
U.S. forces and increase security.
The APKWS will provide the UAE with
flexibility in the use of proportional, preci-
sion fires when operating in remote and
mountainous regions as well as populated
areas. The APKWS will complement the
Hellfire II missile as a secondary precision
munition with lower collateral damage po-
tential. These aspects make the APKWS, em-
ployed in conjunction with UAE’s multiple
types of helicopters and Hellfire II missiles,
an appropriate munition for the UAE’s
counterterrorism operations. UAE will have
no difficulty absorbing the APKWS into its
armed forces.
The proposed sale of this equipment and
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.
The prime contractor will be BAE Sys-
tems, Nashua, NH. There are no known offset
agreements proposed in connection with this
potential sale.
Implementation of this proposed sale will
require up to 20 U.S. Government and up to
30 contractor representatives to travel to
UAE.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.
TRANSMITTAL NO. 17–73
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(l) of the
Arms Export Control Act
Annex Item No. vii
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
1. The APKWS II All-Up-Round (AUR) is an
air-to-ground weapon that consists of an
APKWS II Guidance Section (GS), legacy
2.75-inch MK66 Mod 4 rocket motor and leg-
acy MK152, MK282 and MK435/436 warhead/
fuze. The APKWS II GS is installed between
the rocket motor and warhead and provides
a Semi-Active Laser (SAL) precision capa-
bility to legacy unguided 2.75-inch rockets.
The APKWS II is procured as an independent
component to be mated to the appropriate
2.75-inch warhead/fuze. The GS is manually
set with the appropriate laser code during
loading and is launched from any platform
configured with a LAU–68F/A, or similar
launcher(s). After launch, the GS activates
and the seeker detects laser energy reflected
from a target designated with a remote or
autonomous laser. The control system then
guides the rocket to the target. The only
interface required with the host platform is
a 28V direct current (DC) firing pulse.
2. APKWS II increases stowed kills by pro-
viding precise engagements at standoff
ranges with sufficient accuracy for a high
single-shot probability of hit against soft
and lightly armored targets, thereby mini-
mizing collateral damage. The APKWS II is
capable of day and night operation and per-
formance in many adverse environments.
3. The APKWS II requires no depot mainte-
nance. Activities to prepare the APKWS II
for use include setting the laser code switch-
es, turning on the Electronic Thermal Bat-
tery Initiator, and loading the AUR into the
launcher. Wing Slot Seals (WSS) may be re-
placed, if necessary, at an I-level mainte-
nance facility.
4. All training for APKWS II is unclassi-
fied. The training required is:
a. Pilot training to effectively employ the
APKWS II,
b. Ordnance Handler training for safe han-
dling and preparation of the APKWS II and
AUR, and
c. Maintenance training for replacement of
WSS.
5. If a technologically advanced adversary
were to obtain knowledge of specific hard-
ware, the information could be used to de-
velop countermeasures which might reduce
weapons system effectiveness or be used in
the development of a system with similar or
advanced capabilities.
6. A determination has been made that the
United Arab Emirates can provide substan-
tially the same degree of protection for sen-
sitive technology being released as the U.S.
Government. This proposed sustainment pro-
gram is necessary to the furtherance of the
U.S. foreign policy and national security ob-
jectives outlined in the policy justification.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION
Saudi Arabia—Follow-on Logistics Support
and Services
Saudi Arabia has requested to buy follow-
on logistics support and services for the
Royal Saudi Air Force aircraft, engines, and
weapons; publications and technical docu-
mentation; support equipment; spare and re-
pair parts; repair and return; calibration
support and test equipment; personnel equip-
ment; U.S. Government and contractor tech-
nical and logistics support, and other related
elements of program support. Equipment and
spares will be procured for support of, but
not limited to, F–5, F–15, KA–350, C–130, KC–
130, E–3, RE–3, and KE–3 aircraft. The total
estimated program cost will be $1.8 billion.
The Secretary of State has determined and
provided detailed justification that an emer-
gency exists that requires the immediate
sale to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia of the
above defense articles (and defense services)
in the national security interests of the
United States, thereby waiving the Congres-
sional review requirements under Section
36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act, as
amended.
This proposed sale will support U.S. for-
eign policy and national security objectives
by helping to improve the security of a
friendly country that continues to be an im-
portant force for political stability and eco-
nomic growth in the Middle East. Saudi Ara-
bia will have no difficulty absorbing this
support and services into its armed forces.
The proposed sale will sustain Saudi Ara-
bia’s operations and maintenance activity,
improve sustainability and ensure capability
for near and long term air operations across
the fleet.
The proposed sale of this equipment and
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.
There will be various contractors associ-
ated with the equipment involved with this
case, and there is no prime contractor. There
are no known offset agreements proposed in
connection with this potential sale.
Implementation of this proposed sale will
require the assignment of a small number of
additional U.S. Government or contractor
representatives to Saudi Arabia for mainte-
nance, training, and sustainment.

REMEMBERING THAD COCHRAN
Mr. ENZI. Madam President, today I
wish to honor the life and legacy of the
late Senator Thad Cochran.
I appreciate having this opportunity
to celebrate the life and accomplish-
ments of Senator Cochran. His loss will
be deeply felt by all of us here in the
Senate, not only by those of us who
served with him, but also by the many
staff and individuals he has worked
with over time. Elected to the House of
Representatives in 1972, Senator Coch-
ran touched many lives in his 46 years
faithfully serving his State of Mis-
sissippi in Congress.
As the son of a school principal and a
math teacher, Senator Cochran under-
stood the value of hard work and dedi-
cation. He emerged as a leader among
his peers from a young age. He was an
Eagle Scout who helped establish a new
troop and valedictorian of his class in
high school where he earned varsity
letters in football, basketball, baseball,
and tennis. At the University of Mis-
sissippi, Senator Cochran was a frater-
nity president, student body vice presi-
dent, and a member of Omicron Delta
Kappa, a national honorary leadership
fraternity. Senator Cochran began his
service to our country while at the
University of Mississippi as a company
commander in the Navy ROTC and,
once graduated, was commissioned an
ensign in the U.S. Naval Reserve and
assigned to duty aboard the USS
Macon.
As a fellow Eagle Scout, Senator
Cochran demonstrated core scouting
values like trust, loyalty, courtesy,
and reverence. He displayed these val-
ues not only in his nearly five-decade-
long career in Congress, but also as a
father to his two children, Kate and
Clayton.
Described as gentle and soft-spoken,
Senator Cochran was a defender of Sen-
ate procedure and often worked across
the aisle. Senator Cochran was known
to hold strong opinions; yet he devel-
oped close working relationships with
members of both parties. Senator Coch-
ran was determined that, if you look
hard enough, there is common ground
to be found with everyone. He earned
his nickname of the Quiet Persuader
through a determined yet respectful
approach to negotiations.
I had the honor of working with Sen-
ator Cochran in his role as chairman of
the Appropriations Committee while I
was chairmen of the Budget Com-
mittee. He was a hard worker and al-
ways guided by his core values. As a
good statesman, he didn’t let party pol-
itics get in the way and always did
what he thought was right.
In a nearly five-decade-long career in
Congress, it is difficult to pinpoint
Senator Cochran’s single greatest
achievement. Following Hurricane
Katrina’s devastation, Senator Coch-
ran played a central role in security re-
lief funds for Gulf States, especially for
his home State of Mississippi. During
his tenure as chairman of the Agri-
culture Committee, Senator Cochran
was a champion of the farm bill’s nu-
trition programs. Senator Cochran
served as a tireless advocate for farm
families and America’s agricultural in-
dustry.
Senator Cochran authored the Mis-
sissippi Wilderness Act, which was the
first Federal legislation ever passed for
the perpetual protection of lands in the
State of Mississippi. He was greatly in-
volved in land and wildlife conserva-
tion in Mississippi, a legacy of his that
will endure for future generations to
enjoy.
Senator Cochran was an effective
lawmaker who was a tireless advocate
for his constituents. His model of pub-
lic service was that the constituents
are always right. He said we are in
Congress to serve, not to be served.
Senator Cochran’s model of public
service is one to look up to and his
style of leadership will serve as an in-
spiration for future generations to
come.
Senator Cochran was a committed
man of faith. A member of the South-
ern Baptist Church, he was always one
to do what he thought was right rather
than what was easiest.
My wife Diana joins me in sending
our deepest condolences to his loved
ones and know he will find eternal
peace and happiness knowing he had a
profound effect on all that knew him a
colleague, as a father, and as a friend.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL
ERIK H. TORRING
∑ Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I am
proud to recognize BG Erik H. Torring
III, who is retiring after 30 years in the
U.S. Army. General Torring has been a
leader in not only our soldiers’ health,
but the health of all the service ani-
mals that support our soldiers, sailors,
airmen, and marines on the battlefield.
General Torring’s career culminated
in his current post as both Deputy
Chief of Staff for Operations in the
Army’s Office of the Surgeon General
and Chief of the U.S. Army Veterinary
Corps, where he oversees the recruit-
ment, training, and equipment of al-
most 3,000 veterinary personnel in the
U.S. Army. He spearheaded the devel-
opment of the Army’s electronic vet-
erinary records program and main-
tained standards for food safety across
the Armed Forces.
For his service to the United States
of America, I am proud to recognize
Brigadier General Torring and welcome
him home to Texas.∑

REMEMBERING STAFF SERGEANT
JORDY SOESBE
∑ Mr. ROUNDS. Madam President,
today I would like to remember the life
of retired U.S. Army National Guard
SSG Jordy James Soesbe. Staff Ser-
geant Soesbe passed away on May 20,
2019, at the age of 44.
Jordy Soesbe was born in Burke, SD,
and raised on his family’s farm and
ranch in Gregory, SD.
Soesbe spent more than 20 years in
the U.S. Army and Army National
Guard, retiring in 2017 at the rank of
staff sergeant in the National Guard.
He completed two tours of duty in Af-
ghanistan, serving as a gunner on a
Humvee, sniper, and prison guard. He
served with the Army’s 82nd Airborne
Division and 25th Infantry Division and
the South Dakota National Guard’s
235th Military Police Company.
During his time in the military, he
earned numerous commendations and
medals, including the Afghanistan
Campaign Medal with Campaign Star,
Armed Forces Reserve Medal with ‘‘M’’
Device and 10-year Hourglass Device,
Army Commendation Medal, and four
Army Achievement Medals.
Aside from his career in the military,
he also served as a reserve sheriff’s dep-
uty with the Meade County Sheriff’s
Office.
In his spare time, he was an avid
pheasant and deer hunter. He also en-
joyed spending time at his local shoot-
ing range.
Staff Sergeant Soesbe was not only a
hero in life, but also a hero in death.
As an organ donor, he saved at least
three lives. I commend this hero for his
service, both in life and death, and
offer my sincerest condolences to his
family and friends. He is survived by
his mother Virginia; brother Brett;
daughters Alexandra, McKenna, and
Alyssa; and numerous nieces, nephews,
aunts, uncles, cousins, and in-laws.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and
were referred or ordered to lie on the
table as indicated:
POM–75. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
designating May 2019 as ‘‘Amyotrophic Lat-
eral Sclerosis (ALS) Awareness Month’’ in
Pennsylvania; to the Committee on Health,
Education, Labor, and Pensions.
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 122
Whereas, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS) is better known as Lou Gehrig’s dis-
ease; and
Whereas, ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative
disease characterized by degeneration of cell
bodies of the upper and lower motor neurons
in the gray matter of the anterior horn of
the spinal cord; and
Whereas, The initial symptom of ALS is
weakness of the skeletal muscles, especially
those of the extremities; and
Whereas, As ALS progresses, the patient
experiences difficulty in swallowing, talking
and breathing; and
Whereas, ALS eventually causes muscles
to atrophy and the patient becomes a func-
tional quadriplegic; and
Whereas, Patients with ALS typically re-
main alert and are aware of their loss of
motor functions and the inevitable outcome
of continued deterioration and death; and
Whereas, ALS affects military veterans at
twice the rate of the general population; and
Whereas, ALS occurs in adulthood, most
commonly between 40 and 70 years of age,
peaking at approximately 55 years of age,
and affects both men and women without
bias; and
Whereas, More than 5,000 new ALS patients
are diagnosed throughout the nation each
year; and
Whereas, In Pennsylvania there are cur-
rently more than 1,000 individuals who have
been formally diagnosed with ALS; and
Whereas, The $750,000 in State funding ap-
propriated by the General Assembly for ALS
support services for 2018–2019 provided serv-
ices to nearly 1,000 constituents and a sub-
stantial savings to the State budget and tax-
payers; and
Whereas, The ALS Association reports
that on average, patients diagnosed with
ALS only survive two to five years from the
time of diagnosis; and
Whereas, ALS has no known cause, preven-
tion or cure; and
Whereas, ‘‘Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
Awareness Month’’ increases the public’s
awareness of ALS patients’ circumstances
and acknowledges the negative impact this
disease has on ALS patients and their fami-
lies and recognizes the research being done
to eradicate ALS; therefore be it
Resolved, That the Senate of the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania designate the month
of May 2019 as ‘‘Amyotrophic Lateral Scle-
rosis Awareness Month’’ in Pennsylvania;
and be it further
Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be
transmitted to the President of the United
States, the presiding officers of each house of
Congress and to each member of Congress
from Pennsylvania.
POM–76. A joint resolution adopted by the
Legislature of the State of Tennessee urging
the President of the United States to des-
ignate a state funeral for the last surviving
Medal of Honor recipient from World War II
when such recipient passes away; to the
Committee on Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs.
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 96
Whereas, World War II, the most wide-
spread war in history, lasted from 1939 until
1945; and
Whereas, the United States entered the
war in 1941, following an attack on Pearl
Harbor by Japanese fighter planes; and
Whereas, over sixteen million Americans
served their country and the Allied powers
over the course of the war; and
Whereas, the men and women who served
our country in World War II have been col-
lectively called the ‘‘greatest generation’’
for their selfless sacrifice; and
Whereas, the Medal of Honor is the highest
military decoration that is awarded by the
United States government; and
Whereas, the Medal of Honor is presented
by the President of the United States, in the
name of Congress; and
Whereas, the Medal of Honor is only con-
ferred upon members of the United States
Armed Forces who distinguished themselves
through conspicuous gallantry and intre-
pidity at the risk of life above and beyond
the call of duty while engaged in action
against an enemy of the United States, while
engaged in military operations involving
conflict with an opposing foreign force, or
while serving with friendly forces engaged in
an armed conflict against an opposing armed
force in which the United States was not a
belligerent party; and
Whereas, more than 3,400 Medals of Honor
have been awarded to our nation’s bravest
soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coast
guardsmen since the creation of the award in
1861; and
Whereas, the Medal of Honor was awarded
to 353 Americans during World War II; and
Whereas, only four of those 353 Americans
are still alive today; and
Whereas, each of these courageous service-
men, Charles H. Coolidge of Tennessee,
Francis S. Currey of New York, Robert D.
Maxwell of Oregon, and Hershel Woodrow
Williams of West Virginia, risked his life
while serving his country with conspicuous
gallantry and intrepidity and therefore de-
serves the gratitude of the American people;
and
Whereas, the President of the United
States has the sole authority to designate a
state funeral; and
Whereas, historically, the President of the
United States has designated state funerals
for former presidents, generals, and other ex-
traordinary Americans; and
Whereas, our nation is currently divided
and yearns for a unifying national event; and
Whereas, designating a state funeral when
the last surviving World War II Medal of
Honor recipient dies would be a wonderful
way for the American people to unite and
honor all sixteen million soldiers, sailors,
airmen, marines, and coast guardsmen who
served in our Armed Forces from 1941 to 1945:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate of the One Hundred
Eleventh General Assembly of the State of Ten-
nessee, the House of Representatives concurring,
That this General Assembly urges the Presi-
dent of the United States to designate a
state funeral for the last surviving Medal of
Honor recipient from World War II when
such recipient passes away; and be it further
Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Sen-
ate is instructed to transmit a certified copy
of this resolution to the President of the
United States, the Vice President of the
United States, the Speaker of the United
States House of Representatives, the Presi-
dent Pro Tempore of the United States Sen-
ate, and all members of the Tennessee con-
gressional delegation.
POM–77. A concurrent resolution adopted
by the Legislative Assembly of the Common-
wealth of Puerto Rico requesting the United
States Congress to take action to appro-
priate funds and resources as necessary to
dredge the Dos Bocas, Loco, Loiza (Carraizo),
and Lucchetti reservoirs, which were ad-
versely affected by excessive sedimentation
in the wake of hurricanes Irma and Maria in
Puerto Rico; to the Committee on Energy
and Natural Resources.
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 60
It is a known fact that Puerto Rico has no
natural lakes. Hence, in the early 20th cen-
tury, it was necessary to build the first res-
ervoir or artificial lake, so as to address fun-
damental needs such as water storage for
residential or industrial consumption, hydro-
power generation, irrigation of agricultural
lands, and flooding control and mitigation,
among other important uses. Today, we have
thirty-six (36) main reservoirs formed by the
dams built in the rivers located in the moun-
tain region in the center of the Island, and
two (2) outside of the main riverbeds in the
eastern region.
It is true that reservoirs are Puerto Rico’s
most important source of water, however,
issues such as sedimentation, the lack of re-
forestation plans, and the accelerated ero-
sion caused by urban development, among
other aspects, have seriously affected the
storage capacity of these bodies of water.
In addition to the foregoing, after hurri-
canes Irma and Maria made landfall on Sep-
tember 2017, many of our lakes were severely
affected by a sudden accumulation of sedi-
ment. The path followed by hurricane Irma—
a category-5 hurricane—brought it really
close to the island, and two weeks later, hur-
ricane Maria made landfall on the island.
Hurricane Maria has been classified as one of
the most powerful natural disasters to ever
affect Puerto Rico in recent history. The lat-
ter left a lot of devastation, flooding, tor-
rential rain, and severe damage across the is-
land.
The catastrophic effects of these weather
events had a significant impact on four (4) of
our most important reservoirs. Out of the
lakes that supply our drinking water, Loı́za
(Carraı́zo) is one of the most affected by sedi-
mentation. Said sedimentation has reduced
the depth of the lake thus impairing its ca-
pacity to collect water, despite being fed pri-
marily by the Rı́o Grande de Loı́za, which is
the largest river on the island. The storage
capacity of the Loı́za reservoir (Carraı́zo) has
been nearly halved as a result of sedimenta-
tion.
Sedimentation is also the main problem af-
fecting the Dos Bocas, Lucchetti, and Loco
Lakes, all of which are at critical levels,
threatening their storage capacity and water
quality, because water turbidity increases as
reservoir levels decrease. The rapid sediment
accumulation has reduced the useful life of
the most important reservoirs by sixty (60)
percent. Therefore, the United States Con-
gress failure to take immediate action and
appropriate the funds needed to dredge the
Dos Bocas, Loco, Loiza (Carraı́zo), and
Lucchetti reservoirs would hinder the hydro-
power generation and drinking water supply
for the thousands U.S. citizens who reside on
the Island. The critical levels of these four
(4) reservoirs calls for the urgent dredging
and restoration of these bodies of water, so
that they may serve the purposes for which
they were built, as well as to mitigate and

control future flooding in the communities
surrounding these bodies of water.
For all of the foregoing, this Legislative
Assembly deems it necessary and convenient
to request the Congress of the United States
of America, on behalf of the U.S. citizens
born in this U.S. Territory, to appropriate
funds and resources as are necessary to
dredge the Dos Bocas, Loco, Loiza (Carraı́zo),
and Lucchetti reservoirs, which were ad-
versely affected by hurricanes Irma and
Marı́a.
Be it resolved by the Legislative Assembly of
Puerto Rico:
Section 1.—The Congress of the United
States of America is hereby requested to

POM–78. A concurrent resolution adopted
by the Legislative Assembly of the Common-
wealth of Puerto Rico requesting the United
States Congress to take action to appro-
priate funds and resources as necessary to
dredge the Dos Bocas, Loco, Loiza (Carraizo),
and Lucchetti reservoirs, which were ad-
versely affected by excessive sedimentation
in the wake of hurricanes Irma and Maria in
Puerto Rico; to the Committee on Energy
and Natural Resources.
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 60
It is a known fact that Puerto Rico has no
natural lakes. Hence, in the early 20th cen-
tury, it was necessary to build the first res-
ervoir or artificial lake, so as to address fun-
damental needs such as water storage for
residential or industrial consumption, hydro-
power generation, irrigation of agricultural
lands, and flooding control and mitigation,
among other important uses. Today, we have
thirty-six (36) main reservoirs formed by the
dams built in the rivers located in the moun-
tain region in the center of the Island, and
two (2) outside of the main riverbeds in the
eastern region,
It is true that reservoirs are Puerto Rico’s
most important source of water, however,
issues such as sedimentation, the lack of re-
forestation plans, and the accelerated ero-
sion caused by urban development, among
other aspects, have seriously affected the
storage capacity of these bodies of water.
In addition to the foregoing, after hurri-
canes Irma and Maria made landfall on Sep-
tember 2017, many of our lakes were severely
affected by a sudden accumulation of sedi-
ment. The path followed by hurricane Irma—
a category-5 hurricane—brought it really
close to the island, and two weeks later, hur-
ricane Maria made landfall on the island.
Hurricane Maria has been classified as one of
the most powerful natural disasters to ever
affect Puerto Rico in recent history. The lat-
ter left a lot of devastation, flooding, tor-
rential rain, and severe damage across the is-
land.
The catastrophic effects of these weather
events had a significant impact on four (4) of
our most important reservoirs. Out of the
lakes that supply our drinking water, Loı́za
(Carraı́zo) is one of the most affected by sedi-
mentation. Said sedimentation has reduced
the depth of the lake thus impairing its ca-
pacity to collect water, despite being fed pri-
marily by the Rı́o Grande de Loı́za, which is
the largest river on the island. The storage
capacity of the Loı́za reservoir (Carraı́zo) has
been nearly halved as a result of sedimenta-
tion.
Sedimentation is also the main problem af-
fecting the Dos Bocas, Lucchetti, and Loco
Lakes, all of which are at critical levels,
threatening their storage capacity and water
quality, because water turbidity increases as
reservoir levels decrease. The rapid sediment
accumulation has reduced the useful life of
the most important reservoirs by sixty (60)
percent. Therefore, the United States Con-
gress failure to take immediate action and
appropriate the funds needed to dredge the
Dos Bocas, Loco, Loı́za (Carraı́zo), and
Lucchetti reservoirs would hinder the hydro-
power generation and drinking water supply
for the thousands U.S. citizens who reside on
the Island. The critical levels of these four
(4) reservoirs calls for the urgent dredging
and restoration of these bodies of water, so
that they may serve the purposes for which
they were built, as well as to mitigate and
control future flooding in the communities
surrounding these bodies of water.
For all of the foregoing, this Legislative
Assembly deems it necessary and convenient
to request the Congress of the United States
of America, on behalf of the U.S. citizens
born in this U.S. Territory, to appropriate
funds and resources as are necessary to
dredge the Dos Bocas, Loco, Loiza (Carraı́zo),
and Lucchetti reservoirs, which were ad-
versely affected by hurricanes Irma and
Marı́a.
Be it resolved by the Legislative Assembly of
Puerto Rico:
Section l.—The Congress of the United
States of America is hereby requested to
take action to appropriate funds and re-
sources as are necessary to dredge the Dos
Bocas, Loco, Loı́za (Carraı́zo ), and Lucchetti
reservoirs, which were adversely affected by
excessive sedimentation in the catastrophic
wake of hurricanes Irma and Marı́a in Puerto
Rico.

POM–79. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Michigan urging the
United States Congress to continue full fund-
ing of the Great Lakes Restoration Initia-
tive; to the Committee on Environment and
Public Works.
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 25
Whereas, the Great Lakes are a critical re-
source for our nation, supporting the econ-
omy and a way of life in Michigan and the
other seven states within the Great Lakes
region. The Great Lakes hold 20 percent of
the world’s surface freshwater and 90 percent
of the United States’ surface freshwater.
This globally significant freshwater resource
provides drinking water for more than 30
million people and directly supports 1.5 mil-
lion jobs, generating $62 billion in wages; and
Whereas, the Great Lakes Restoration Ini-
tiative (GLRI) has provided crucial funding
to support long overdue work to protect and
restore the Great Lakes. In partnership with
the states, local governments, and other or-
ganizations, the federal government has in-
vested more than $3 billion and supported
over 4,700 projects over the last decade, in-
cluding around $600 million for more than
1,100 projects in Michigan. These projects
have cleaned up toxic pollution. reduced run-
off from cities and forms, combatted
invasive species, and restored fish and wild-
life habitat; and
Whereas, the Great Lakes Restoration Ini-
tiative has made a significant difference and
represents a sound investment in both the
environment and the economies of the Great
Lakes region. A 2018 study calculated that
for every federal dollar invested in Great
Lakes restoration there is $3.35 in additional
economic activity, with older industrial cit-
ies like Detroit seeing an even higher return
on investment; and
Whereas, the Great Lakes Restoration Ini-
tiative has made a particular difference in
addressing toxic hot spots around the Great
Lakes. Prior to the GLRI, only one of these
31 ‘‘areas of concern’’ within the United
States had been cleaned up in more than 20
years. Since 2010, GLRI funding has facili-
tated the cleanup of six additional areas of
concern, five in Michigan. Cleaning up these
areas of concerns makes a real difference to
the environment as well as local economies
by improving water quality, restoring fish
and wildlife habitat, enhancing recreational
opportunities, and facilitating new develop-
ment; and
Whereas, far more work needs to be done.
Whether toxic algal blooms shutting down
Toledo’s drinking water supply, invasive
carp threatening billion-dollar fisheries, or
contaminated sediments restricting rec-
reational opportunities, substantial limita-
tions and threats to the use of the Great
Lakes remain. Twenty-four areas of concern
still need additional cleanup work done, in-
cluding eight in Michigan. These problems
require a collaborative effort to solve; and
Whereas, less than 40 percent of the avail-
able funds have been spent in recent years
cleaning up the federally designated areas of
concern. Greater emphasis should be placed
on addressing these sites, including having
most of the available dollars designated to-
wards completing cleanup of the remaining
areas of concern. While other needs have
merit as well, cleaning up these sites would
bring significant benefits to impacted com-
munities; and
Whereas, the President’s Fiscal Year 2020
federal budget proposes to reduce funding for
the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative by 90

percent, though later commitments pledged
to continue funding at past levels. This con-
tinued funding is appreciated as restoration
efforts will only become more expensive and
more difficult if they are not addressed in
the coming years. The federal government
needs to remain an active partner with the
Great Lakes region; now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate, That we memori-
alize the Congress of the United States to
continue full funding of the Great Lakes
Restoration Initiative; and be it further
Resolved, That we encourage that funding
be prioritized towards cleaning up and
delisting the remaining Great Lakes areas of
concern and that a detailed comprehensive
strategy and schedule be developed to direct
the use of funding for the areas of concern;
and be it further
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be
transmitted to the President of the United
States Senate, the Speaker of the United
States House of Representatives, and the
members of the Michigan congressional dele-
gation.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself,
Mr. YOUNG, Mr. WYDEN, and Mr.
ISAKSON):
S. 1703. A bill to amend the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 to reform the low-
income housing credit, and for other
purposes; to the Committee on Fi-
nance.
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I
rise today to speak about the introduc-
tion of Senate legislation to help us
deal with the affordable housing crisis
in the United States of America.
Many of my colleagues know how
pervasive this problem is. Not only is
affordable housing a crisis, but the
homeless population that results from
not having enough housing stock in the
United States of America is also a cri-
sis and ends up costing us more money
to deal with the same population.
This is not a new issue. It is not a
new problem. We have been trying to
fight to address this issue in the U.S.
Senate and to deal with the affordable
housing crisis for years, but the mag-
nitude of the problem is getting worse.
We need to respond by helping to in-
crease supply. That is because we have
so many demographic trends which we
see in report after report citing and
documenting what is happening in the
United States of America.
We have an ever-increasing senior
population that is living longer and
baby boomers reaching retirement,
many of whom need more affordable
housing than there is in the market-
place.
We have returning veterans from our
overseas missions who are coming
home and who also need affordable
housing.
We need workforce housing. Many
parts of the United States of America
have had great economic success but
have not kept pace with the amount of
housing stock, and, thus, the supply
and pricing has resulted in astronom-
ical challenges to provide affordable
housing within a region that doesn’t
leave people driving hours a day just to
commute to their jobs.
We have the remnants of our eco-
nomic crisis during the great recession
that left so many people without af-
fordable housing and the fact that we
did not keep pace with supply.
Over the last 2 years, I have worked
with many organizations at the na-
tional level and participated in the an-
nouncement of many reports done by
practically every institution of any
significance in the United States. They
all came to the same conclusion: We
need to increase supply.
That is why I am introducing the Af-
fordable Housing Tax Credit Improve-
ment Act of 2019, along with my col-
leagues Senator YOUNG of Indiana, Sen-
ator ISAKSON of Georgia, and Senator
WYDEN of Oregon, to strengthen and
improve the affordable tax credit that
we already have in place. My col-
leagues in the House—Representatives
DELBENE, MARCHANT, BEYER, and
WALORSKI—are also introducing com-
panion legislation today.
We did make progress in the last
Congress in increasing the affordable
tax credit. This tax credit helps pro-
vide resources for 90 percent of the fed-
erally-funded affordable housing that is
built in the United States of America.
That is because it takes the tax credit
to incent people to build at this more
affordable rate.
I have always said to my colleagues
that I am willing to consider any other
ideas that we have to increase afford-
able housing and will work with any-
body to increase supply in the United
States, and I am open to any ideas. But
until we have ideas that are more suc-
cessful than this, I am going to con-
tinue to push the affordable housing
tax credit and push to increase the sup-
ply of the tax credit so that we can in-
crease the supply of affordable housing.
We have a housing crisis in the State
of Washington. It doesn’t matter
whether you are in Spokane or Walla
Walla or Yakima or Vancouver. Our
urban areas feel it the most and are
most pinched. It causes problems for
our law enforcement. It causes prob-
lems for our healthcare delivery sys-
tem. It causes problems for our trans-
portation system. The way out of this
problem is to build more affordable
housing.
Increasing the amount of tax credit
by 50 percent over the next 10 years
will give our States, our cities, and our
counties more resources to build af-
fordable housing. It will also provide
stability in the value of affordable
housing tax credits used in the bond fi-
nance markets and place a 4-percent

floor under the credit. This gives more
certainty to those who are building
housing and producing it and rehabili-
tating that in the market.
It also maximizes the availability of
the private activity bonds by recycling
any multifamily bonds that are used
along with housing credits to build af-
fordable housing. Together, these steps
would help us build hundreds of thou-
sands of new units of affordable hous-
ing over the next 10 years.
In my State and other States, it
would mean that we would see a 50-per-
cent increase in the amount of credit
available over the next 10 years. That
is so important because each housing
project that is built takes more people
out of the dire situations they are in,
takes the vulnerable population and
gives them the opportunity to move
forward.
It also saves us dollars. The Senate
Finance Committee has heard time and
again from those testifying—whether it
is the homebuilders or the health in-
surance industry—that it is more cost-
ly to deal with this population while
they are homeless. That is to say, you
can’t deliver job training to a tent.
And somebody who doesn’t have proper
home and a stable place to live is more
likely to show up in our healthcare de-
livery system, costing us more money.
This legislation will also make it
easier for formerly homeless students
to also get help from the affordable
housing tax credit under current HUD
rules of the program.
It also helps those who are protected
under the Violence Against Women Act
can also qualify for affordable housing
as they have in the past.
We know that the challenge of mov-
ing forward on affordable housing is
something that is a bipartisan issue.
The tax credit has had bipartisan sup-
port for many, many years in the U.S.
Congress. We just need to put the pedal
to the metal and provide more of the
tax credit so that we can get more af-
fordable housing built in the United
States of America.
I hope my colleagues will help by
signing on to this legislation, and as
we discuss various proposals in the Fi-
nance Committee regarding tax policy,
I hope my colleagues will help us push
to our States and communities more
solutions that will deal with this crisis.
By Mr. JONES:
S. 1708. A bill to amend the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 to establish a re-
fundable tax credit for the installation
of a storm shelter at a qualified resi-
dence; to the Committee on Finance.
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, the sec-
ond bill I have introduced today would
create a one-time refundable tax credit
of up to $2,500 for homeowners to build
or purchase a storm shelter for their
home. It would ensure that people
won’t have to travel dangerous dis-
tances to seek shelter in the event of
sudden severe weather.
Alabamians know all too well that
extreme weather can strike at any
time, especially now as we move from
the spring tornado season into the
summer hurricane season. That is why
I want to use this opportunity today to
urge every single one of my colleagues
to support these bills and these efforts
so that all of our communities can be
better prepared when natural disasters
strike, and they will.
In Lee County, I have been discussing
with local officials these two bills,
which are just a step. They are obvious
steps to me. Not everybody can afford
to buy a storm shelter, so the tax cred-
it would not be available. So, working
with the Lee County M.A. and officials
on the ground, we are trying to learn
best practices. What can we better do
to harden those areas where people live
in the rural communities so they will
not lose their lives, much less all of
their possessions? That is what we are
planning to do, and the two bills today
are first steps.
I sincerely hope going forward that
helping fellow Americans who have suf-
fered disasters will no longer be the
partisan issue that it suddenly became
this year and that we can get back to
the business of taking care of our citi-
zens and those who have sent us here to
represent them.
By Mr. JONES (for himself, Mr.
KENNEDY, and Mr. CASSIDY):
S. 1709. A bill to direct the Secretary
of Transportation to establish a grant
program to improve evacuation routes
in rural communities, and for other
purposes; to the Committee on Envi-
ronment and Public Works.
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, while it is
critical that communities get the dis-
aster relief they need after the fact, it
is also important that folks can better
prepare for natural disasters and help
make our communities safer so that we
can reduce the impact and costs of the
inevitable severe weather we will have
in this country.
The 2019 hurricane season is upon us.
It started just last Saturday. Folks in
my neck of the woods and especially
down in South Alabama know that
means storms can come at any time.
Fortunately with hurricanes, they can
get some warning, but for tornadoes
like the ones that hit Lee County, it is
just minutes.
It is not a question of whether severe
weather will happen; it is a question of
when and where. It is also a question of
whether we will be prepared when it
strikes again. That is why today I am
introducing two bills. The first is co-
sponsored by my Louisiana colleagues,
Senators KENNEDY and CASSIDY. It
would establish a new grant program
through the U.S. Department of Trans-
portation that would award up to $100
million for projects to improve emer-
gency evacuation routes in small and
rural communities.
Generally in our State and in a lot of
the coastal States, there is only one or
two major evacuation routes, which is
just not enough to handle the situation
should another hurricane hit the gulf.
This grant money would help expand
those routes.
The grants would be used for two pur-
poses: to build State and local con-
nector roads that would improve access
to the broader thoroughfares and to ex-
pand existing roads and bridges so that
folks can evacuate safely during ex-
treme weather events. These infra-
structure investments would also have
the additional benefit of serving rural
Alabama communities year-round and
expanding and improving some of our
aging roadways. With expanding and
improving aging roadways and giving
better access to rural communities,
economic expansion will follow.

SENATE RESOLUTION 230—RECOG-
NIZING THE SIGNIFICANT MILE-
STONE OF SENIOR CORPS VOL-
UNTEERS SERVING 50,000,000
HOURS IN 2018

CASSIDY, Mr. DURBIN, Mr. REED, Mr.
COONS, Mr. MARKEY, Ms. ROSEN, Ms.
KLOBUCHAR, Ms. HIRONO, Mr. BROWN,

Mrs. CAPITO, Mr. KING, Mrs. FEINSTEIN,
Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr. MANCHIN, Mr.
VAN HOLLEN, Ms. DUCKWORTH, Ms. COL-
LINS, and Ms. MCSALLY) submitted the
following resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to:
S. RES. 230
Whereas volunteers in the United States
who are 55 years of age and older (referred to
in this preamble as ‘‘senior volunteers’’) pro-
vide much needed services to their commu-
nities, neighbors, and friends;
Whereas Senior Corps, through the RSVP,
Foster Grandparent, and Senior Companion
programs administered by the Corporation
for National and Community Service, pro-
vides meaningful volunteer opportunities to
220,000 senior volunteers and recruits thou-
sands of additional community volunteers;
Whereas, for more than 5 decades, RSVP
volunteers, Foster Grandparents, and Senior
Companions have played an important role
in strengthening communities by contrib-
uting their experience, knowledge, and ac-
complishments in order to—
(1) help their neighbors recover from nat-
ural and manmade disasters;
(2) provide nutrition services;
(3) mentor and tutor schoolchildren;
(4) support veterans and military families;
and
(5) provide respite care to caregivers;
Whereas in 2018, Senior Corps volunteers
provided more than 50,000,000 hours of direct
service through more than 23,000 nonprofit,
educational, and faith-based community
groups nationwide;
Whereas structured volunteering by senior
volunteers—
(1) keeps those senior volunteers active,
healthy, and engaged;
(2) helps communities across the United
States by solving local problems;
(3) helps the United States by saving tax-
payer dollars, reducing health care costs,
and strengthening democracy; and
(4) helps seniors live independent and pro-
ductive lives;
Whereas the RSVP, Foster Grandparent,
and Senior Companion programs have proven
to be cost-effective ways to engage senior
volunteers in volunteer service that meets
pressing community needs;
Whereas recent research suggests that—
(1) volunteering not only slows the cog-
nitive decline of aging for older individuals
in the United States, but also provides an
important pathway for alleviating loneli-
ness; and
(2) throughout the United States, and espe-
cially in rural areas, older individuals are
‘‘aging in place’’ and are thereby particu-
larly susceptible to loneliness, which under-
mines health and is linked to early mor-
tality;
Whereas the United States should expand
senior volunteer service opportunities to
take advantage of the talents and experi-
ences of the 10,000 baby boomers who will re-
tire each day for the next 20 years;
Whereas, at a time of mounting social need
and growing interest in service by older indi-
viduals in the United States, the United
States has an unprecedented opportunity to
harness the talents of senior volunteers to
address community challenges; and
Whereas the people of the United States
should join in the celebration of Senior
Corps volunteers during ‘‘Older Americans
Month’’ in May 2019: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) acknowledges the contributions that
Senior Corps volunteers make to—
(A) the communities in which those volun-
teers live and serve; and
(B) the United States; and

RECOGNIZING THE 101ST ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE REPUBLIC DAY OF
AZERBAIJAN
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the 101st anniversary of the Re-
public Day of Azerbaijan, and to extend my
best wishes to all Azerbaijanis. May 28th
marks the founding of the Democratic Repub-
lic of Azerbaijan, when the people of Azer-
baijan first gained their independence from the
Russian Empire in 1918. Although Azer-
baijan’s independence was ended by Soviet
forces in 1920, the Democratic Republic of
Azerbaijan was the world’s first secular par-
liamentary democratic republic in a predomi-
nantly Muslim nation—earning diplomatic rec-
ognition from the United States during the ad-
ministration of President Woodrow Wilson. We
also recall that the Democratic Republic of
Azerbaijan granted universal suffrage to its
citizens in 1918, making it the first Muslim
country to give women the right to vote.
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union,
Azerbaijan restored its independence on Octo-
ber 18, 1991, when its Parliament adopted the
Constitution Act on the Restoration of the
State of Independence of the Republic of
Azerbaijan.
Azerbaijan has emerged as a key player for
enhancing global energy security. Azerbaijan
also provides roughly 40 percent of Israel’s oil
consumption and enjoys friendly ties with
Israel beyond oil sales.
Jews have resided in Azerbaijan for 2,500
years without persecution and today, the Jew-
ish community in Azerbaijan numbers over
12,000. Azerbaijan is also home to Christian
communities and has been praised for its reli-
gious tolerance by the European Parliament.
Azerbaijan is a key global security partner
for the United States. As an active member of
NATO’s Partnership for Peace program, Azer-
baijan cooperates with the United States in
countering terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and
narcotics trafficking. Azerbaijani troops serve
shoulder to shoulder with U.S. soldiers in Af-
ghanistan, as they previously did in Kosovo
and Iraq. In support of the International Secu-
rity Assistance Force in Afghanistan, Azer-
baijan has extended important over-flight
clearances for U.S. and NATO flights as well
as regularly providing landing and refueling
operations at its airports for U.S. and NATO
forces.
As co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan
Caucus, I stand with the Azerbaijani people as
they continue to work towards independence
and security as well as to embrace human
rights and democratic values. I congratulate
the people of Azerbaijan on the centennial of
their Republic Day. May the partnership be-
tween the United States and Azerbaijan
progress and continue to benefit both of our
nations.
RECOGNIZING DENNIS ‘‘D.J.’’
JEWELL
HON. TRENT KELLY
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize Mr. Dennis ‘‘D.J.’’
Jewell for receiving the Governor’s Initiative
for Volunteer Excellence Award in the Out-
standing Volunteer Service by a U.S. Veteran
category.
D.J., a resident of Columbus, Mississippi,
was a past commander for VFW Post No.
4272 and completed over 1,000 community’
service hours in 2018. As a veteran, one of
his main concerns is the mental health of fel-
low service members, specifically veterans
suicide rates. To prevent this issue in his com-
munity, Jewell established a monthly support
group for combat veterans at the VFW and
has also traveled to Washington, D.C. to ad-
vocate for mental health support for veterans.
I am honored to have the privilege to rep-
resent outstanding servicemen such as D.J.
His selfless service to our country extends
past his military career as he continues to go
above and beyond for Mississippians each
day. It is individuals like him that make Mis-
sissippi, and America, great.

RECOGNIZING THE GOREVILLE
HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS’ SOFTBALL
TEAM
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to
congratulate the Goreville High School girls’
softball team on winning the 2019 Illinois
Class 1A championship. Goreville overcame
the Glasford Illini Bluffs by a score of 4–2 in
seven innings. This win marked the season
with a 29–9 overall record for the Blackcats.
The team’s overall tenacity and determina-
tion were observed through the commanding
victories during postseason action. Throughout
all of the postseason bracket games, the lady
Blackcats scored over 70 runs as a team,
causing many games to end early due to the
run rule. This is Goreville’s second state
championship title in three years.
Head Coach Shanna Green conditioned the
team with a spirit of competition and passion
of working for one another. In the champion-
ship game, the Blackcats only committed one
error and batted an impressive .346 as a
team.
It is an honor for me to extend my profound
congratulations to the entire team which in-
cludes Abigail King, Kelsey Ray, Miley
Kwiatkowski, Emma Vaughn, Kyleigh Massey,
Ellie Grammer, Cheyenne Walker, Chloe
Wolaver, Alexandria King, Adrianna Licka,
Destani Bennett, Samantha Licka, and Payton
Sopczak.
Madam Speaker, the athletes, coaching
staff, and the community should be proud of
their accomplishments. I wish the graduating
seniors the best in their future endeavors and
best of luck to those returning for a chance of
a third state title in four years.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 2019
OUTAGAMIE COUNTY BREAK-
FAST ON THE FARM HOSTED BY
STEFFENS DAIRY FARM
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the tradition of Breakfast
on the Farm in Outagamie County.
Breakfast on the Farm is an iconic Wis-
consin tradition that provides the community
an opportunity to see first-hand how a dairy
farm operates and learn about the significant
role the dairy industry plays in Wisconsin’s
economy. Community members meet dairy
farmers, explore the barns and equipment,
and enjoy a delicious meal prepared on the
farm.
Outagamie County Dairy Promotion orga-
nizes the annual Breakfast on the Farm by re-
cruiting host farms, sponsors, and volunteers
to support this terrific event. In addition,
Outagamie County Dairy Promotion provides
educational opportunities to the community to
increase awareness of Wisconsin’s dairy in-
dustry and the products produced by area
dairy farmers.
I am grateful to Steffens Dairy Farm for
hosting the 2019 Outagamie County Breakfast
on the Farm. Steffens Dairy Farm was estab-
lished in 1971 when Joe Steffens purchased
farmland in Seymour. Since 2004, the farm
has been maintained by his wife, Lorraine,
and sons, Dan and Steve. Today, Steffens
Dairy Farm, LLC milks 120 cows and man-
ages over 280 acres of crop land. Always pur-
suing innovative practices, the Steffens
equipped their barn with two Lely Robotic
milkers, resulting in cleaner, healthier, and
more comfortable cattle.
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this
body to join me in commending the efforts of

RECOGNIZING THE 30TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE TIANANMEN
SQUARE MASSACRE
HON. STEVE COHEN
OF TENNESSEE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the 30th Anniversary of the
Tiananmen Square Massacre.
Starting on April 18, 1989 thousands of stu-
dents marched through Tiananmen Square
calling for a more democratic government and
protesting China’s Communist government. An
estimated 1 million people joined the protests
in Tiananmen Square and citizens in over 400
Chinese cities staged protests.
After months of protests, late in the after-
noon of June 3 thousands of troops moved
onto Tiananmen Square and fired into crowds
throughout the night into June 4. The People’s
Republic of China has still not admitted to how
many people were killed by the military but de-
spite the Chinese government downplaying
the number killed, it was likely in the thou-
sands.
The Chinese government has tried to erase
this tragedy from history in order to uphold its
Communist regime’s legitimacy.
The Chinese government continues to vio-
late the human rights of its citizens including
putting millions of members of its Uyghur mi-
nority into ‘‘re-education’’ camps and con-
tinuing suppression of democratic voices
throughout China.
We must continue to commit ourselves to
supporting the values for which the victims of
Tiananmen Square Massacre gave their lives.

CONGRATULATING MR. AND MRS.
CARL AND JANET BREWER’S
50TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I
rise to honor Mr. and Mrs. Carl and Janet
Brewer and congratulate them on their 50th
Wedding Anniversary. The Brewers will cele-
brate this incredible milestone anniversary on
June 14, 2019.
Carl and Janet both grew up in St. Louis,
Missouri. They married at age 16 and have
been by each other’s side ever since. The
couple eventually moved to Lohman, Missouri
then to Wardsville where they still reside
today. Both dedicated their lives to public
service and the betterment of our community
while working for the Missouri Department of
Revenue. Carl’s dedication as a public servant
did not start and stop there. His service in our
military and as a policeman at the John Coch-
ran Hospital and Jefferson Barracks is a per-
fect example of a man who put the lives of his
neighbors and fellow Americans before his
own.
Now, both retired from the Missouri Depart-
ment of Revenue, Carl and Janet most enjoy
spending time with what they consider their
proudest accomplishment: their family. They
have been blessed with a son, Carl Brewer II
and daughter, Stephanie Brewer Palmer.
Stephanie and her husband Jason have given
the Brewers the greatest gift a family can re-
ceive with the birth of their granddaughter, Mi-
randa.
When they aren’t spending time with their
family, the Brewers can often be found at
Solid Rock Family Church in Jefferson City
where they attend service each Sunday and
Wednesday. Along with their congregation and
family, I thank the Brewers for their many con-
tributions to Missouri and our community.
Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating Mr. and Mrs. Carl and Janet Brew-
er on their 50th Wedding Anniversary. May
they have many more happy years to come.

OATH CEREMONY ON JUNE 7, 2019
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with
great pleasure and sincerity that I take this
time to congratulate thirty individuals who will
take their oaths of citizenship on June 7,
2019. This memorable occasion will be held at
the United States Courthouse and Federal
Building in Hammond, Indiana.
America is a country founded by immi-
grants. From its beginning, settlers have come
from countries around the world to the United
States in search of better lives for their fami-
lies. Oath ceremonies are a shining example
of what is so great about the United States of
America—that people from all over the world
can come together and unite as members of
a free, democratic nation. These individuals
realize that nowhere else in the world offers a
better opportunity for success than here in
America.
On June 7, 2019, the following people, rep-
resenting many nations throughout the world,
will take their oaths of citizenship in Ham-
mond, Indiana: Ewa Szczepanik, Marcin Jan
Kryczka, Martha Cecilia Meadows, Daewon
Sun, Shams Khalaf, Negma H. Scott,
Nosratollah Rezaee, Sonia Miramontes, Maria
Reyes-Arellano, Brandi Jennifer Ellinger,
Scepan Kovacevic, Eduardo de Freitas
Ferreira, Lian Gu, Vicente Mauricio Gonzaga
Gonzaga, Eric Coria Garcia, Sladan
Alempijevic, Denise Alejandra Godinez, Sam-
uel Assam, Claudia Gillies, Mark William
Gillies, Wanpeng Tan, Erasto Lopez Lecona,
Delun Shi, Milene Hurtado, Guang Dai, Emma
Garza, Gintaras Bansevicius, Ancy Isac
George, Jose Rodolfo Moreno, and Jose G.
Londono.
Although each individual has sought to be-
come a citizen of the United States for his or
her own reasons, be it for education, occupa-
tion, or to offer their loved ones better lives,
each is inspired by the fact that the United
States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln de-
scribed it, a country ‘‘. . . of the people, by the
people, and for the people.’’ They realize that
the United States is truly a free nation. By
seeking American citizenship, they have made
the decision that they want to live in a place
where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment
of the Constitution, they can practice religion
as they choose, speak their minds without fear
of punishment, and assemble in peaceful pro-
test should they choose to do so.
Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask you and
my other distinguished colleagues to join me
in congratulating these individuals who will be-
come citizens of the United States of America
on June 7, 2019. They, too, are American citi-
zens, guaranteed the inalienable rights to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We, as a
free and democratic nation, congratulate them
and welcome them.

REMEMBERING THOMAS A. CAHILL
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 04, 2019
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the memory and service of
Thomas A. Cahill, a member of the University
of California, Davis community for over 45
years who embodied the American spirit of in-
novation and enduring dedication to his family
and community.
Born on March 4, 1937, Thomas grew up in
Sudbury, Massachusetts and earned his Ph.D.
in nuclear physics from University of Cali-
fornia, Los Angeles. In 1967, Thomas joined
U.C. Davis’ Crocker Nuclear Laboratory,
where he conducted research for the Pioneer
and Voyager spacecraft before beginning his
work on California air quality. The aerosol and
visibility network he developed as the director
of Crocker Nuclear Laboratory improved the

panded into the current nationwide IMPROVE

kind in the world.
Beyond his scientific contributions, Thomas
served as the thesis advisor to over two dozen
Ph.D. students, published eight books, and
donated 196 acres of land to the U.C. Natural
Reserve System as the Cahill Riparian Pre-
serve. For his work, U.C. Davis awarded
Thomas the Academic Public Service Award
in 1994 and the Outstanding Emeritus Pro-
fessor Award in 2014. Following his retirement
in 1994, Thomas continued his work on
aerosols, including testimony before Congress
on pollutant levels caused by the collapse of
the World Trade Center. Even while ill, Thom-
as developed an ultrafine aerosol sampler to
help people living near freeways. His contribu-
tions to science and public health established
a legacy that will endure for many years to
come.
He is survived by his wife Ginny; children
Cathy and Tom; sister Barbara; and nieces
and nephews. I know that they, along with the
rest of his extended family and friends, join
me in celebrating his life and his memory.

IN RECOGNTIION OF PAMELA
ADAMS’ LIFE AND LEGACY
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Pamela Adams for her life-
time of service. Mrs. Adams passed away on
May 9, 2019 which greatly saddened our com-
munity. Her work to expand access to high-
quality education is worthy of commendation.
A lifelong resident of Dearborn, Michigan,
Pamela Adams graduated from Edsel Ford
High School and attended Henry Ford Com-
munity College. After working at Ford Motor
Company for a short period, Mrs. Adams
began her significant work in service of edu-
cation. Mrs. Adams held various positions in
the Dearborn School Board, Wayne County
Association of School Boards, and served on
the Henry Ford College Board of Trustees for
18 years. During her tenure on the Board of
Trustees, Pamela Adams contributed to sev-
eral key decisions. She was instrumental in
the successful 2002 bond which brought four
new schools to Dearborn, and formed the
award-winning Henry Ford Collegiate Acad-
emy, a program where Dearborn students can
earn both a high school diploma and an asso-
ciate degree in 5 years at no cost.
Pamela Adams’ life stands as a role model
of selfless service and demonstrates a tre-
mendous love for her community. Beloved for
her generosity and compassion, Mrs. Adams’
reputation is a testament to the significant im-
pact she had on the city of Dearborn and its
residents. We are grateful for Mrs. Adams’
commitment to increasing access to high-qual-
ity education. Her efforts have dramatically ex-
panded the educational opportunities for resi-
dents of the state of Michigan and will con-
tinue to impact future students’ lives.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring Pamela Adams for a lifetime of
service to her community. We are grateful for
her dedicated work as a member of the Henry
Ford College Board of Trustees, her compas-
sion and leadership will be greatly missed.

HONORING THE LIFE OF CHIEF
COLABE III
HON. BRIAN BABIN
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life of Mikko Colabe III Clem Fain
Sylestine, the principaL chief of the Alabama-
Coushatta Tribe of Texas who passed away
on May 21, 2019 at 91 years old.
Chief Colabe III was born on November 4,
1927, on the Alabama-Coushatta Indian Res-
ervation and is of the Granddaddy Long Legs
Clan. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree
from Austin College in Sherman, Texas in
1952. Chief Colabe III was a teacher and
coach at Southmayd High School, Holland
High School, Shepherd High School, Wood-
ville ISD, and Goodrich ISD. Although he re-
tired in 1988, Chief Colabe III touched so
many lives throughout his time in education.
In addition to the passion he had for edu-
cating children, Chief Colabe III was a distin-
guished tribal leader for most of his adult life.
He served as an elected Tribal Council mem-
ber and then served as its chairman for many
years. He assumed his chieftainship role in
1995 as the second chief and was elected as
the principal chief in 2014. In serving as the
principal chief, he followed in the footsteps of
his father, Bronson Cooper Sylestine, who
served as the chief from 1936 to 1969. Chief
Colabe III was a direct descendant of Chief
Colabe, who served as the second chief to
Principal Chief Antone in the early 1800s. He
also was an elder in the Indian Village Pres-
byterian Church on the Alabama-Coushatta
Reservation.
As I join the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe in
their period of mourning through the end of
2019, I want to recognize the impact that
Chief Colabe III had on many East Texas
communities. The Alabama-Coushatta Tribe is
an integral part of East Texas, large in part
because of Chief Colabe III’s passion, leaders
hip, and hard work for the people he cared so
deeply for.
Madam Speaker, my prayers and condo-
lences are with the family, friends, and Tribe
of Chief Colabe III.

CONGRATULATING THE REPUBLIC
OF AZERBAIJAN ON ITS 101ST
REPUBLIC DAY
HON. MICHAEL R. TURNER
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, I would like
to congratulate the Republic of Azerbaijan on
its 101st Republic Day. On May 28, 1918, the
Republic of Azerbaijan was formed, becoming
the first democracy in the Muslim world. Unfor-
tunately, just a few short years later, Azer-
baijan was invaded by the Russian Red Army
in 1920 and was subsequently occupied by
the Soviet Union.
After the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991,
Azerbaijan regained its independence and has
been a key international partner of the United
States ever since. Together, the United States
and Azerbaijan continue to work as partners in
combating terrorism and transnational threats.
Azerbaijan has played a vital role in assisting
our NATO allies and has supported U.S. oper-
ations overseas, particularly in Afghanistan.
Azerbaijan is an important ally in bolstering
European energy security—therefore, it is im-
perative that the United States continue to
support initiatives such as the Southern Gas
Corridor, which routes natural gas from Azer-
baijan to Europe. Azerbaijan is a key partner
in securing U.S. interests in the region.
Madam Speaker, it is for these reasons that
I urge all of my colleagues to join me in con-
gratulating Azerbaijan on the 101st anniver-
sary of its Republic Day.

MEMORIAL HONORING ST. LOUIS
POET LAUREATE SHIRLEY
LEFLORE
HON. WM. LACY CLAY
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mr. CLAY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
pay tribute to a great American poet who, as
a child, fell in love with words and turned that
love of words into a life’s work.
On Mother’s Day, Sunday, May 12, 2019,
my dear friend, Shirley Bradley Price LeFlore
passed into ancestry. She was 79. Her pass-
ing gave Mother’s Day ‘‘a new meaning,’’ one
daughter said in a local media report. A Cele-
bration of Life and Homegoing Service was
held on Friday, May 17 at Christ Church Ca-
thedral, in St. Louis, Mo., where many came
and paid loving homage to her life and her
works. The visitation and service included nu-
merous speakers, musicians, dancers, family,
friends and fellow poets.
To her dear daughters—Hope Lindsay of
Silver Springs, Md., Jacie Price of St. Louis
and Lyah LeFlore-ltuen of St. Louis—the
depths of my sadness at her loss moves me
beyond the ties of friendship. She was like
family. I pray for heavenly grace for her family:
her daughters, a niece Karen Bohr and four
grandchildren—Noelle Lindsay-Stewart, Jullian
Price-Baez, Jordan Lindsay and Bella Grace
Ituen—and all who loved and honored her.
Shirley has been interwoven into the fabric
of St. Louis, Mo., this nation and the world.
She has shared her love of poetry, writing and
many talents with the rest of us, and we are
better off because of her.
On November 9, 2018, Shirley LeFlore was
named St. Louis’ second Poet Laureate. She
was the first African-American and woman so
honored. The event was held in St. Louis City
Hall, with Ms. LeFlore surrounded by family,
friends and admirers.
At the time Poet Michael Castro, St. Louis’
first Poet Laureate called the honor ‘‘the cap-
stone’’ of a long career; a career The St. Louis
Post-Dispatch noted that spanned some 50
years of ‘‘performing, mentoring and teach-
ing.’’ As her story was told and retold, one dis-
covers that not only did she find poetry in ev-
erything, she lived a poetic life.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch covered the
City Hall event and on November 17, pub-
lished a story about her appointment. Reporter
Jane Henderson noted Ms. Leflore’s’ life jour-
ney and how she was led by the power of
words to international fame. ‘‘As a girl,’’ Hen-
derson wrote, ‘‘she listened to women in her
mother’s beauty shop as they told stories. She
listened in as strangers gossiped on street-
cars, when churchgoers talked and when fe-
male relatives chatted at the kitchen table.
Young Shirley would make up plays about
some of the people she’d overheard and start-
ed writing in grade school. As an adult, she
turned talk into an art, becoming a pioneer in
spoken-word poetry in St. Louis.’’
At City Hall, President of the Board of Alder-
men Lewis Reed presented the honor to Ms.
LeFlore. And Castro, who has known Ms.
LeFlore since the 1970s, called her an ‘‘iconic

and loved figure.’’ He told the Post-Dispatch:
‘‘Her performances were very memorable. She
had a strong presence and charisma. She
read her poems kind of with a jazz beat. Her
poems were not like anyone else’s, full of rich
imagery.’’
Madam Speaker, that career includes more
than 50 years of performing, mentoring and
teaching. Some call her a ‘‘wordsmith’’ and
others call her a ‘‘word warrior,’’ noted Alder-
man Terry Kennedy, a longtime friend. He
read part of her poem ‘‘Rivers of Women’’ not-
ing that her writing cause people to ‘‘think dif-
ferently.’’
Born, Shirley Bradley Price in 1940 in St.
Louis, Ms. LeFlore graduated from Sumner
High School and attended Lincoln University
before graduating from then Webster College
and later from Washington University with a
degree in psychology. Among her many
achievements, she is founder of the Creative
Arts and Expressions Lab, was an original
member of the Black Artists Group (co-found-
ed with her late husband, jazz musician Floyd
LeFlore) and another underground activists
poetry organization called Harmony.
An artist-in-residence at University City pub-
lic schools, she taught at several colleges in-
cluding Lindenwood University, Webster Uni-
versity, Harris-Stowe State University and the
University of Missouri-St. Louis. As an assist-
ant dean of students at Webster she inspired
students such as ‘‘Black-ish’’ actress Jenifer
Lewis, who credits LeFlore with having ‘‘saved
my life,’’ the Post-Dispatch reported.
Though getting on in age, ‘‘She’s always
had an intergenerational perspective,’’ said her
daughter, Lyah LeFlore-Ituen, in the news arti-
cle. ‘‘She wants to inspire young poets.’’
‘‘The fire is still there,’’ and as poet laureate,
LeFlore can be an inspiration to young people,
her daughter added.
A TV producer and writer, her daughter di-
rected ‘‘Rivers of Women’’ for the Missouri
History Museum. She called her mother a ‘‘liv-
ing legend’’ and is working on a documentary
about her. Also, she helped compile her moth-
er’s 2013 book, ‘‘Brassbones & Rainbows.’’
Among the greats she performed with in-
clude saxophonist Oliver Lake, trumpeter
David Jackson and singer Fontella Bass. Peo-
ple flocked to hear her read at St. Louis’ Duffs
restaurant as part of the River Styx artist se-
ries. Her mentors and influences include poet
Margaret Walker, writer Gwendolyn Brooks,
poet Sonia Sanchez, playwright and poet
Ntozake Shange and author James Baldwin.
In New York she performed at the
Nuyorican Poets Café and at Weill Hall, a part
of Carnegie Hall. And her works have been
presented as plays, including ‘‘Deliverance,’’ a
production centered on HIV/AIDS.
Poet Amina Baraka has called Ms. LeFlore
a ‘‘literary griot, writing and telling stories, cre-
ating lyrics we can sing and dance to.’’ Other
honors include: the Warrior Poet Award, a
board member for Word in Motion, featured in
another documentary ‘‘Word Warriors III’’ and
other anthologies.
Her activism of the 1960s led her to March
on Washington and to join the Poor People’s
Campaign. Politics became a part of her po-
etry. But it was the voices heard in her youth
that set the stage for the rest of her life and
career.
Last fall Poet Laureate LeFlore was featured
in The St. Louis American newspaper, and
later reproduced by St. Louis Public Radio.
The article noted she toured the world, playing
venues both large and small, from Powell
Symphony Hall in St. Louis to ‘‘quaint . . . tiny
. . . churches’’ or a ‘‘hole in the wall’’ night-
club or lounge.’’
‘‘Some of the places I’ve gone, you wouldn’t
want anybody to know you went there to read
poetry,’’ Leflore said. ‘‘But if people asked me,
I would go.’’ ‘‘If you’re serious about what you
do, keep doing it, keep studying it, keep mas-
tering it and let it live inside you.’’ And ‘‘Lis-
ten—especially when you first start out. You
need to listen.’’ It was her listening—her
eavesdropping on her mother’s beauty salon
clients—that caught her ear and helped
shaped her poetry in the years to come.
‘‘They thought I was sitting around playing
jacks, but I would be listening,’’ to the way
they talked, what they said, LeFlore told the
American. Later, she would go home and write
in her black and white composition book, not-
ing that often the way they said things was
more striking than what they said. Over time
she would note that black people have a ‘‘spe-
cial way with language—in every part of the
world—but especially in St. Louis.’’
Of her funeral on May 17, 2019, the Amer-
ican reported the near-capacity homegoing
service for ‘‘Saint Shirley’’ at Christ Church
Cathedral ‘‘stretched nearly four hours.’’ Acco-
lades and memories were offered from speak-
ers from far and near, among them poets, ac-
tors, writers and politicians. Actor and writer
Kevin Powell called her a ‘‘supernatural word
warrior’’ created from ‘‘black girl magic.’’
Poet Laureate of East St. Louis Eugene
Redmond said LeFlore ranked among the
great jazz poets for her ability to turn musical
form and history into ‘‘the cross-fertilization’’ of
literary musical forms and techniques, he said.
‘‘She eloped with language and stayed mar-
ried to music all her days.’’
And while people of faith offered words of
tribute, LeFlore’s own poems, spoken by the
living meant LeFlore ‘‘essentially eulogized
herself,’’ the American’s Kenya Vaughn wrote.
Daughter Hope Price-Lindsay said she grew
up wanting a mother more like television’s
‘‘Leave it to Beaver’s’’ June Cleaver but in-
stead got Ms. LeFlore, an Afrocentric artist
who remained true to her craft, whether life
served her ‘‘caviar and champagne’’ or ‘‘bone
soup.’’ We learned that LeFlore inherited her
poetry from her mother, who inherited it from
her mother, who inherited from her mother.
Retired 18th Ward Alderman Terry Kennedy
spoke again at her funeral, having grown up
with Ms. LeFlore and calling her ‘‘a mighty
spirit amongst us’’ who was ‘‘small in stature,
big at heart.’’ He comforted guests with Ms.
LeFlore’s own words from her poem,
‘‘Breathprints.’’
‘‘Light a candle for me,’’ he recited. ‘‘Say a
prayer. Whisper me into the wind. Lay a love
wreath on the altar of your heart and remem-
ber my good days amongst you. Weep if you
must. It’s good to unburden your tears, but
make brief your grief.
‘‘Let the joy of my laughter comfort you,’’
Kennedy continued in her words. ‘‘My spirit
will be the music above your head, my love
like the wind beneath your wings to lift you in
your weary years so that you may see the
sunrise. All is well with my soul.’’
Madam Speaker, today I give to Congress
and the people of America, a glimpse into the
life and times of a world-renown and re-
spected poet from St. Louis, Missouri, and her
vision for seeing, touching, feeling the world
around us—St. Louis Poet Laureate Shirley
LeFlore.
I urge members of Congress to join me in
honoring the life and career of St. Louis Poet
Laureate Ms. Shirley LeFlore and her art of
language and her expression in words, of our
life and times. May she rest in peace.

state of Michigan. For 50 years, they have
provided comprehensive support services for
some of the most vulnerable members of our
community.
Founded in 1969, Ozone House is a com-

RECOGNIZING COMMAND CHIEF
MASTER SERGEANT MELANIE K.
NOEL
HON. LARRY BUCSHON
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mr. BUCSHON. Madam Speaker, today I
wish to recognize and congratulate a tremen-
dous Airman and native of Vincennes, Indiana,
Command Chief Master Sergeant Melanie K.
Noel, on the occasion of her retirement from
the U.S. Air Force after 27 years of distin-
guished military service to this great Nation.
Chief Master Sergeant Noel’s outstanding
career has culminated with her final assign-
ment as the Command Chief Master Sergeant
for the Air Force District of Washington. Chief
Noel represents the highest enlisted executive
level of leadership in the Air Force District of
Washington and advises the commanding
general on all issues regarding the readiness,
training, welfare, morale, proper utilization,
and progress of more than 40,000 Air Force
military and civilian members in more than 500
locations across 108 countries. Prior to as-
suming her current position, Chief Noel faith-
fully served as the 6th Air Mobility Wing’s
Command Chief Master Sergeant and was
also the Senior Enlisted Advisor for the U.S.
Air Force’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Re-
sponse Office.
Chief Master Sergeant Noel entered the
U.S. Air Force on April 9, 1992 as a security
forces specialist and was later chosen for re-
training into the field of personnel administra-
tion. Her honorable service has spanned nu-
merous overseas and stateside assignments
including two European countries, three
States, the District of Columbia, and a deploy-
ment in support of Operation IRAQI FREE-
DOM. In 2006, Chief Noel was competitively
selected to become a First Sergeant, spending
several years caring for the service’s newest
Airmen at the ‘‘Gateway to the Air Force.’’
Recognizing her leadership potential, the Air
Force continued to challenge her with in-
creased responsibilities as an instructor at the
U.S. Air Force First Sergeants Academy. Ex-
celling in this demanding position, Chief Noel
taught fellow senior noncommissioned officers
the intricacies of equitable discipline, profes-
sional development, and esprit de corps. Her
superb performance at the First Sergeants
Academy garnered the attention of Chief Mas-
ter Sergeant of the Air Force James Roy, who
selected Chief Noel to become the service’s
first-ever Enlisted Legislative Fellow in the Na-
tion’s Capital.
As a true testament to Chief Master Ser-
geant Noel’s exceptional career, she served
as not only the U.S. Air Force’s first Enlisted
Legislative Fellow but also its sole enlisted
representative on Capitol Hill in 2013. During
this period, Chief Noel was assigned to the of-
fice of Representative Niki Tsongas from Mas-
sachusetts. With the Congresswoman’s posi-
tion as Ranking Member on the House Armed
Services Oversight and Investigations Sub-
committee, Chief Noel played a key role as
her lead staffer during the headline-making
Benghazi hearings. Moreover, she worked dili-
gently to increase congressional awareness of
impacts to both the Department of Defense
and national security community caused by
the 2013 federal government shutdown. Fi-
nally, her tireless efforts were critical to the bi-
partisan passage and implementation of the
2014 National Defense Authorization Act.
Chief Master Sergeant Noel clearly epito-
mizes the finest qualities of a military leader.
Throughout her tenure, she has been instru-
mental in advocating for Airmen across the
globe while strengthening the total force team
through innovative solutions, focused resil-
iency, and exceptional leadership develop-
ment. Her unrivaled expertise and exemplary
professionalism have further resulted in nu-
merous accolades, including the Legion of
Merit, Meritorious Service Medal with four oak
leaf clusters, Air Force Commendation Medal
with two oak leaf clusters, Air Force Achieve-
ment Medal with one oak leaf cluster, as well
as annual award recognition at the squadron,
group, and wing levels within the U.S. Air
Force. Additionally, Chief Noel was the recipi-
ent of the Distinguished Honor Graduate
Award at the Joint Special Operations Forces
Senior Enlisted Academy.
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United
States Congress and a grateful Nation, I ex-
tend our deepest appreciation to Chief Master
Sergeant Melanie K. Noel for her many years
of extraordinary dedication and selfless mili-
tary service. There is no question that the U.S.
Air Force, Department of Defense, and United
States have significantly benefited from Chief
Noel’s visionary leadership and devotion to the
cause of freedom. I wish nothing but the very
best for her and her family in the future.

HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Everett Whitcher for winning the
Citizen of the Year Award through the
Kewanee Chamber of Commerce. Mr.
Whitcher’s dedication to organizations in the
Kewanee community is admirable.
Mr. Whitcher is a graduate of Wethersefield
High School and went on to pursue his career
in the grocery business. Since 1989, Mr.
Whitcher has been the owner of the Super
Value grocery store, which is now Save-A-Lot
in Kewanee, Illinois. In 2015, Mr. Whitcher
needed to keep up with the demands of the
community so he moved his Kewanee store to
a bigger location on South Main Street where
he expanded his food and meat inventory. Mr.
Whitcher is an active participant in the local
community and has contributed a great deal to
Kewanee’s economy. In addition to running his
business, he assists all the food pantries in
Kewanee and donates pet food to the Hu-
mane Society. Mr. Whitcher has been an ac-
tive member of the Kiwanis Club since 2007
and serves on the Board of Directors in a con-
tinued effort to give back to his neighbors. I
admire Mr. Whitcher’s service to the commu-
nity and thank him for his many contributions
as he accepts the Citizen of the Year Award.
It is because of community leaders like Mr.
Whitcher that I am especially proud to serve Il-
linois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam

gratulate Everett Whitcher for winning the Cit-
izen of the Year Award given by the Kewanee

Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, l rise
today to recognize the St. Augustine Art Asso-

founding in 1924.
Founded by Spanish explorers in 1565, St.
Augustine, Florida, is the oldest continuously
inhabited European-established settlement in
the continental United States, making it our
nation’s first city. The STAAA plays an integral
role in preserving and promoting the artistic
heritage of St. Augustine, and has been de-
scribed as the epicenter of the local art com-
munity. The STAAA Art Center is open year-
round and is free to the public, welcoming
roughly 10,000 visitors annually. Its gallery
hosts exhibitions, concerts, workshops, class-
es, lectures, and other art-related events.
More than 1,000 artists of all backgrounds dis-
play their artwork during the gallery’s season
of juried exhibitions. These contemporary art-
ists make up St. Augustine’s present-day art
colony.
The STAAA outreach programs serve many,
including the blind, local public school stu-
dents, and patients and caregivers at Flagler
Hospital. Additionally, elder groups, community
businesses, and others all benefit from
STAAA’s user-friendly gallery in the heart of
St. Augustine. I am pleased to recognize
STAAA for its contributions to our unique local
culture, history, and community.

OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize Vandalia, Illinois, which is cele-

Located in Fayette County, Vandalia was
the state’s first capital city. Situated on the
Kaskaskia River, the Illinois General Assembly

at his home, while the auditor and secretary of
state worked in the brick building that housed
the state bank.
The first capitol building was destroyed by
fire in 1823 and a second capitol building was
built in haste the following summer. Two years
later people refused to enter the building for
fear it would collapse, and so a third capitol
building was constructed, which is the one that
stands today.
Abraham Lincoln began his political career
in Vandalia in 1834, and five years later the Il-
linois General Assembly met for the last time
in the Vandalia Statehouse. In one of its final
acts, the legislature deeded the building to
Fayette County and the town of Vandalia. The
State of Illinois purchased the old statehouse
and public square in 1918 to ensure its pres-
ervation for future generations, and in the dec-
ades following carried out a major effort to re-
store the building to its Lincoln-era appear-
ance.
Madam Speaker, with four days of activities
planned, the celebration promises to highlight
the city’s rich history. It is an honor to recog-
nize the City of Vandalia as it celebrates its bi-
centennial, and I wish it all the best for the fu-
ture.

IN HONOR OF JANE LAIRD FOR
HER EXEMPLARY SERVICE
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Jane Laird for her excep-
tional service to the United States of America.
Mrs. Laird’s instrumental role as a Rosie, riv-
eting during World War II, is worthy of com-
mendation.
The daughter of a coalminer, Jane Laird
was born in Bearcreek, Montana. In 1943, be-
fore she could graduate high school, Mrs.
Laird moved to Dearbom, Michigan to work for
the Ford Motor Company. During World War
II, she helped construct the B–24 bomber, The
Liberator, riveting the cockpit of the aircraft.
Mrs. Laird’s efforts as a riveter at Ford Motor
Company highlight the many significant con-
tributions of young women during World War
II. After riveting for the Ford Motor Company,
Jane Laird worked part time at E.J. Korvette,
where she remained until her retirement.
Jane Laird’s work embodies the duty we
have to our community and our nation. A
breast cancer survivor, Mrs. Laird stands as a
model of strength, sacrifice, and service. Her
generation’s critical contribution to progress
will always be remembered. Beloved for her
sense of humor and tenacity, Mrs. Laird will fi-
nally receive her high school diploma this
weekend. We thank Jane Laird for her instru-
mental work as a riveter and congratulate her
on her graduation. We are grateful for her
dedicated service to this nation.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring Jane Laird for her exemplary
service as a riveter. Her graduation this week-
end stands as a testament to the dedication,
perseverance, and sacrifice she has displayed
over her lifetime.
RECOGNIZING CHIEF KAREN
COMSTOCK OF CHINO
HON. NORMA J. TORRES
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor my constituent, Chief
Karen Comstock of the Chino Police Depart-
ment. After almost 35 years of public service
and dedication to the Chino community, she is
finally retiring and will be sorely missed.
Chief Comstock honorably rose through the
ranks of the Chino Police Department. Begin-
ning her career in 1985, she served as a
cadet and reserve officer for five years before
being brought on as an official police officer.
Comstock held many other positions including
field training officer, patrol supervisor, and de-
tective bureau supervisor, as well as serving
at the Criminal Investigations Bureau as a de-
tective and as a member of the Crisis Negotia-
tions Team.
In recognition of her excellent leadership,
Comstock was promoted to Chief in 2014. She
served as Chino Police Department’s first fe-
male police chief and is now retiring as one of
only 22 female police chiefs in California.
Chief Comstock not only established stand-
ards of excellence, but also carved out new
pathways for future female leaders in the
Chino Police Department.
Chief Comstock was not only a leader within
the Chino Police Department, but also served
a mentor in the community, committing more
than 14 years to Chino Police Department’s
Explorer Program to assist young adults with
entering law enforcement careers.
She has left a lasting mark on the Chino
Police Department. As a lifelong citizen of
Chino, she has demonstrated bravery, dedica-
tion and loyalty to her hometown and profes-
sion—earning her the esteem of the men and
women of the Chino Police Department and
the community at large.
For her remarkable accomplishments, it is
my honor to recognize Chief Karen Comstock
on the House floor today. Her decades of
commitment and contributions to the City of
Chino are worthy of admiration.

Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to
congratulate the Teutopolis High School base-
ball team on winning the 2019 Illinois Class
2A championship. Teutopolis defeated Pleas-
ant Plains 12–6 for the title, capping a 28–8–
1 season for the Wooden Shoes.
The team’s dedication and hard work were
evident again, as the Wooden Shoes ad-
vanced to the state championship game for
the third straight season and added a second
title to the one captured in 2017. Head Coach
Justin Fleener formed a team with both high
production in the batter’s box and resilient de-
fense in the field.
I extend my sincere congratulations to the
entire team: Mitch Hemmen, Mitch Hardiek,
Brady McMahon, Trenton Schwerdt, Tyler
Runde, Andy Niebrugge, Justin Hardiek,
Derek Deters, Evan Addis, Hayden Ruholl,
Dawson Smith, Evan Wermert, Brock Deters,
Matt Deters, Clint Weber, Brayden Will, Luke

the graduating seniors the best in their future
ventures and good luck to those who will re-
turn for a chance to make it back-to-back
championships next season.

HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the sacrifice of our nation’s
servicemembers at Dearborn’s 95th Memorial
Day Parade. On this day of remembrance, we
recognize our veterans for their selflessness
and courage.
Organized by the Dearborn Allied War Vet-
erans Council and the City of Dearborn, the
city’s Memorial Day Parade is one of the larg-
est in the United States and the oldest contin-
uous parade in the state of Michigan. The
ceremony draws the Dearborn community to-
gether to honor those that have made the ulti-
mate sacrifice in defense of our country. This
year, the event recognizes Gold Star families
and honors the many nameless soldiers who
have died in service of this country. This trib-
ute serves as an important reminder of the pa-
triotic sacrifice of the families of our
servicemembers.
The contributions of our veterans embody
the duty we have to our community through
tireless work, compassion, and leadership. On
Memorial Day, we honor their selfless public
service, and remember those who have given
their lives in service of our country. On this
day we reaffirm our commitment to supporting
our veterans as they continue to protect our
nation and commend their families for their
sacrifice. We thank our brave servicemembers
for their selflessness and sacrifice, and we are
grateful for their commitment to serving the
American people abroad and at home.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring the many servicemen and
women of our nation for their distinguished
service. I wish the Dearborn 95th Memorial
Day Parade a successful celebration to mark
this special occasion.
CONGRATULATING AMBER PATCH-

THROUGH THE KEWANEE CHAM-

HON. CHERI BUSTOS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize Amber Patch-Troxell for winning
the Meritorious Service Award through the
Kewanee Chamber of Commerce. Ms. Patch-
Troxell’s dedication to the Kewanee commu-
nity is admirable, and I commend her for win-
ning this award.
Ms. Patch-Troxell graduated from
Wethersfield High School in 1999 and went on
to pursue a career in insurance. She has been
with Farmers Insurance for 11 years, and is
an asset to the Kewanee community. So much
so that she has been recognized in the com-
munity already by receiving the Elks Club Cit-
izen of the Year award and the Kewanee Park
District’s Child’s Best Friend award. Ms.
Patch-Troxell also started Patchy’s Toy Drive
and has provided Christmas gifts to children
and teenagers in need in the community, while
also providing a helping hand to families who
are faced with loss due to fire or a medical
emergency. Her fundraising events have be-
come community happenings where her kind-
ness and generosity have not gone unnoticed.
I admire Mr. Whitcher’s service to Kewanee
and thank her for her many contributions to
the community.
It is because of community leaders like Ms.
Patch-Troxell that I am especially proud to
serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional District.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE BALTIMORE
MINE TUNNEL DISASTER
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate the 100th anniversary
of the Baltimore Mine Tunnel Disaster, one of
the deadliest mining accidents in Pennsylva-
nia’s history.
On June 5, 1919, more than a hundred min-
ers entered the Delaware & Hudson Coal
Company’s Baltimore Mine Tunnel No. 2 in
Wilkes-Barre. Disaster struck when 12 barrels
of blasting powder ignited, killing 92 miners
and injuring dozens. Historians believe the
blast was caused by a loose power cable that
came into contact with the trolley, causing the
powder from the rear cart to ignite. Unfortu-
nately, only seven miners escaped unscathed.
Following the disaster, legislators ques-
tioned the official procedures and safety regu-
lations in mining plants. They believed regula-
tions were not followed entirely, and many
blamed the Baltimore Mine Tunnel Disaster on
an ambiguous and lax mining code. Historians
believe the incident could have been avoided
if the Pennsylvania mining code had explicitly
prohibited the transportation of powder in the
same trolley cart as miners. As a result, legis-
lators passed sensible protections that re-
stricted the access and distribution of blasting
powder by employees. To this day, the Balti-
more Mine Tunnel Disaster remains one of the
deadliest industrial accidents in Pennsylvania’s
history.
It is our responsibility to commemorate this
day in Northeastern Pennsylvania’s history, re-
member our region’s roots in anthracite coal,
and honor the legacy of those who lost their
lives in the mines.

IN RECOGNITION OF GUS GARCIA
HON. HENRY CUELLAR
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to commemorate the life of Gus Garcia, Aus-
tin, TX’s first Hispanic mayor and the first His-
panic to serve on the Austin school board.
Mr. Garcia was born in Zapata, TX and
moved to Laredo when he was ten years old.
After serving in the Army, he utilized the GI bill
to afford college and graduate from the Uni-
versity of Texas at Austin with a degree in ac-
counting. Later, he would become a Certified
Public Accountant and eventually start his own
firm. While searching for housing in Austin, he
and his wife, Marina, were subject to discrimi-
nation in neighborhoods around the university.
He also faced professional challenges from
those still reluctant to hire a Hispanic account-
ant. These experiences led Mr. Garcia into the
realm of politics and shaped his commitment
to representing Hispanics in Austin, TX.
Mr. Garcia served as a member of the Aus-
tin School Board, city council, and, eventually,
as the Mayor of Austin. His colleagues re-
member him as a dedicated and industrious
civil servant who always inspired those around
him through his tireless efforts. The Gus Gar-
cia Young Men’s Leadership Academy, a mid-
dle school in East Austin, was named in honor
of his groundbreaking career.
Mr. Garcia is survived by his three sons,
five grandchildren, and wife, Marina. However,
he will be remembered by countless others for
his commitment to civil rights and a career
that changed the face of politics in Austin.

OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the 150th anniversary festival of
the Wakamatsu Tea and Silk Farm Colony. As
staff, families, and community members gather
to celebrate this momentous occasion, I ask
all of my colleagues to join me in recognizing
this outstanding historic landmark and all the
Japanese cultural history it has represented
over the past 150 years.
Wakamatsu Farm was established by a Jap-
anese colonist in California in June 1869.
Today, the Wakamatsu Farm represents rich
Japanese-American history and is home to
several organic farming projects and historic
features. The Farm, now owned by the Amer-
ican River Conservancy, hosts two farming
businesses that lease land and buildings on
the property and provide sustainably grown
produce and goods to the community.
I have seen firsthand the incredible impact
the Wakamatsu Farm has had on their sur-
rounding community. For 150 years, the
Wakamatsu Farm has built a community
space that cultivates an appreciation for nat-
ural resources, sustainable agriculture, and
cultural history. The volunteers and partners
have helped preserve the land and create a
beautiful space for visitors to learn about the
Colony’s roots.
Madam Speaker, as the Wakamatsu Farm
and the community it serves gather to cele-
brate the Farm’s 150th anniversary, I ask all
my colleagues to join me in honoring their
commitment to the preservation of such a rich
site for cultural history and to maintain a bio-
logically diverse landscape for the benefit of
the community.

Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Pam Dubois on her 31 years of serv-

Over the last 31 years, Pam has made
countless contributions to our area. She start-

1988 as an accountant and retires today as
Senior Deputy County Manager.
Pam has experienced a very successful ca-
reer and rose through the ranks of the
Cabarrus County Finance Department to be-
come the Finance Director and Deputy County
Manager. Through her leadership, Cabarrus
County has earned the Government Finance
Officers Association (GFOA) Distinguished
Budget Presentation Award for 16 consecutive
years and the GFOA Certificate of Achieve-
ment for Excellence in Financial Reporting for
29 consecutive years.
Pam serves on a distinguished North Caro-
lina Association of County Commissioners
committee, where she advises other counties
with sound fiscal advice, and also on the
North Carolina Finance Certification Program,
from which she received her certification in
1994. She obtained her GFOA of the United
States and Canada Certified Finance Officers
Certificate in June 2001. Pam has also served
for years on the Cabarrus County Convention
and Visitors Bureau Board of Directors.
In addition to her career, Pam is heavily in-
volved with her church—she’s served as an
Elder for Orphan Care, as a parking lot attend-
ant and on the Building and Grounds Com-
mittee. Pam also volunteers in numerous ways
to help veterans, animals and special-needs
children.
Pam is married to Steve Dubois and has
two cats, Brooklyn and Isabell. A graduate
from the University of South Carolina, Pam is
also known as one of the most passionate
Gamecock fans around, despite residing in the
Tar Heel State. I know I speak for everyone in
the community when I say she will be missed
but is well deserving of a long and happy re-
tirement.

ice to our community.

Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor the World War II, Korean War, and Viet-

Chicago, a program that provides World War
II, Korean War, and Vietnam War veterans the
opportunity to visit their memorials on The Na-
tional Mall in Washington, D.C. These memo-
rials were built to honor their courage and
service to their country.
The American Veteran is one of our great-
est treasures. The Soldiers, Airmen, Sailors,
Marines, and Coast Guardsmen who traveled
here on June 5th answered our nation’s call to
service during one of its greatest times of
need. From the European Campaign to the
Pacific Asian Theatre to the African Theater,
these brave Americans risked life and limb,
gave service and sacrificed much, all while
embodying what it is to be a hero. We owe
them more gratitude than can ever be ex-
pressed.
I welcome these brave veterans to Wash-
ington and to their memorials. I am proud to
include in the RECORD the names of these
men and women for all to see, hear, and rec-
ognize, and I call on my colleagues to rise and
join me in expressing gratitude.

FOSTER YOUTH SHADOW DAY
HON. JERRY McNERNEY
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, more
than 415,000 children are currently living in
the foster care system in the United States. As
a member of the Congressional Foster Youth
Caucus, I’m dedicated to strengthening our
nation’s child welfare system for the children
of today and for future generations.
I participate in the annual Congressional
Foster Youth Shadow Day, where current and
former foster youth from across the country
come to Washington to meet with Members of
Congress.
Today I had the privilege of hosting Erica
Hickey, a bright young woman from my home
state of California who has been a foster
youth advocate with California Youth Connec-
tion (CYC) since she went into the foster care
system at the age of sixteen. Today, Erica
serves as a member of CYC’s Board of Direc-
tors and attends UC Davis, where she is
studying political science. She aspires to go to
law school after graduation to study anti-trust
and government fraud law.
Erica is passionate about advocacy and
policies that support youth mental health, fos-
ter youth, homeless youth, and juvenile justice
youth. It’s been a pleasure to host her in our
nation’s capital today, and I wish her the best
in her future endeavors.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE ANT-
WERP HIGH SCHOOL SOFTBALL
TEAM ON THEIR 2019 DIVISION IV
STATE CHAMPIONSHIP
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is my great
pleasure to recognize the Antwerp High
School Lady Archers of Paulding County on
their victory in the 2019 Division IV state
championship in softball. This was the team’s
first-ever state championship, the second state
title in any sport for Antwerp, and one of a
handful of state titles in Paulding County his-
tory.
The Archers held their opponent, Mechan-
icsburg, at bay, winning in a 5–0 shutout—the
first for their opponent in the entire season.
Another highlight of this historic win was the
impressive performance of Pitcher Carlie
Hanes, who tied the state record of 15 strike-
outs in state DIV play and got her 300th
strikeout of the season.
Congratulations to Antwerp softball for their
state title.

GIRLS OF STEEL
HON. MICHAEL F. DOYLE
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania.
Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend the
Girls of Steel Robotics team for qualifying for
the FIRST World Championship for the 9th
year in a row. They received a Wildcard slot
as a Regional Finalist, and they also won the
Gracious Professionalism® award at the 2019
Greater Pittsburgh Regional FIRST Robotics
Competition in California, PA. Gracious Pro-
fessionalism® celebrates outstanding dem-
onstration of FIRST Core Values by working
together both on and off the playing field.
The students are proud that their robot
qualified them to attend the FIRST World
Championship, which has been held in Detroit
since 2018. I think that the remarkable accom-
plishment of continuously making it to the
Championship speaks volumes about the
dedication these young women have in pur-
suing Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Math (STEM) careers, sustaining their team,
and spending thousands of hours collectively
doing outreach in the community. Girls of
Steel are often referred to as the home-town
favorite robotics group and continue to be fea-
tured in videos, print media, and blog posts.
The Girls of Steel attended the FIRST World
Championship in Detroit, Michigan at the end
of April—one of the largest competitions of its
kind, sometimes referred to as the Super Bowl
of Smarts—where they competed against top
teams from all over the world.
FIRST, which stands for ‘‘For Inspiration
and Recognition of Science and Technology,’’
is an organization dedicated to engaging our
students in STEM fields. Hundreds of thou-
sands of students gain practical, team-based
engineering experiences through FIRST every
year.
As a founder and co-chair of the Congres-
sional Robotics Caucus, I believe competitions
like these are important opportunities for our
young people to explore potential careers in
STEM. I’ve witnessed firsthand the incredible
economic growth and development that these
fields have brought to my home district, and I
strongly believe that these fields are crucial to
our nation’s future prosperity.
The FIRST Robotics Competition allows stu-
dents to apply creativity and critical thinking in
the demanding and competitive field of robot-
ics, all while instilling a strong sense of pride

Additionally, I want to convey my deep ap-
preciation to the faculty and staff of Carnegie
Mellon University’s Field Robotics Center, who
have mentored the Girls of Steel since 2010.
Because of their efforts, more young women
have experienced real-world technological
challenges and learned from some of the na-
tion’s best at solving these problems. These
experiences will certainly benefit these young
women in the future.
I congratulate the Girls of Steel and wish
them all continued success in their academic
and professional endeavors.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA POLICE HOME
RULE ACT
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Police Home
Rule Act. This bill is necessary to eliminate
the President’s authority to federalize the Met-
ropolitan Police Department (MPD), the local
District of Columbia police department. The
President has no authority to federalize any
other local or state police department. Under
the Home Rule Act, ‘‘whenever the President
. . . determines that special conditions of an
emergency nature exist which require the use
of the [MPD] for Federal purposes, he may di-
rect the Mayor to provide him, and the Mayor
shall provide, such services of the [MPD] as
the President may deem necessary and ap-
propriate.’’
Under the section of the Home Rule Act that
would be repealed by this bill, the President
may federalize MPD for a period of not more
than 30 days, unless a resolution passed by
Congress extending such federalization is en-
acted into law. Congress may also terminate
the federalization at any time by enacting a
resolution. This bill is necessary, even with
these protections, because, under the principle
of home rule, the President should not have
control over the District’s local police depart-
ment.
While it does not appear that a President
has exercised this authority over MPD, this la-
tent power is totally unnecessary, should not
exist and is an affront to MPD, which has al-
ways voluntarily assisted federal authorities.
MPD’s first responsibility is to protect District
residents and visitors, and it must always re-
main under the authority of the D.C. Mayor to
accomplish its mission. Moreover, federaliza-
tion is outdated in light of current practice.
MPD regularly assists the federal government
as a matter of comity, not as an arm of the
federal government, just as I am sure other
local police departments do in the region.
There are approximately 30 federal police de-
partments under the President’s control in the
District. In the case of a federal emergency,
the President can unilaterally deploy these
federal officers, as well as the D.C. National
Guard, to address it, and also request the
support of our local police department, as the
President would do in any other jurisdiction.
This is an important step to increase home
rule for the District, and I urge my colleagues
to support this bill.

HONORING THE LIFE OF COL.
SCOTT COLSON MARCY
HON. DAVID P. JOYCE
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life of Col. Scott Colson
Marcy, a decorated military officer with twenty-
seven years of service, and express my pro-
found condolences to his family and friends on
his passing.
Born in Conneaut in 1950, Scott was a clear
leader from a young age. Upon graduating
high school, he was accepted into the Class of
1972 at the U.S. Military Academy at West
Point only to be diagnosed with Hodgkin’s
lymphoma just two years later. Through sheer
determination and strength, he became the
first cadet in West Point’s history to be re-
admitted after battling cancer, graduating as a
second lieutenant with the Class of 1973.
Throughout his storied military career, Scott
served honorably both on and off the front
lines all over the world, from an armored cav-
alry troop commander in Germany, to the Di-
rector of Strategy, Plans, and Policy in Italy,
for a U.S. Joint Task Force with Allied Forces
Southern Europe in the War for Kosovo, to an
advisor to the Army National Guard, to the Di-
rector of Alaska Operations for the ground
based missile defense program. Over the
years, Scott also held teaching positions at the
U.S. Military Academy, Dickinson College, and
the Naval Postgraduate School, helping to
shape the minds of our nation’s next genera-
tion of leaders. By the time he retired from ac-
tive duty in 2000, Scott’s exemplary service
had earned him several prestigious awards,
such as the Bronze Star, the Army Com-
mendation Medal and the National Defense
Service Medal.
Equally as impressive as Scott’s career was
the family he built alongside it with his wife,
Suzanne, and their son, Preston. As the son
of a veteran myself, I cannot speak more high-
ly of Scott’s commitment to his country and his
loved ones. In 2013, Scott fully retired to
spend time with his family, enjoy fishing, boat-
ing, traveling, visiting friends and perfect the
art of making sauerkraut. He is survived by
both his wife and son.
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring
the life, service, and legacy of Col. Scott
Colson Marcy.

IN RECOGNITION OF WORLD WAR
II VETERAN ALVIN H. PERRY
HON. BRETT GUTHRIE
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize World War II veteran Alvin H.
Perry, of Wilmore, Kentucky, who will receive
the Legion of Honor Medal from France this
week on the 75th anniversary of the D-Day
Landings. The Legion of Honor Medal is the
highest honor presented by France for military
service to the French people.
Pfc. Perry served in the 331st Infantry Regi-
ment, 83rd Infantry Division. He fought in the
Battle of Normandy from June 18, 1944, to
July 19, 1944, when he was wounded and
captured by enemy forces. He has been
awarded the Prisoner of War Medal, the Pur-
ple Heart Medal, the Good Conduct Medal,
and the WWII Victory Medal for his valiant
service.
Pfc. Perry truly represents the greatest gen-
eration, answering the call to defend freedom
and to liberate Europe from Nazi control. I am
incredibly grateful for his service. I can think of
no one more deserving of this prestigious
honor.

FOSTER YOUTH SHADOW DAY 2019

Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to both acknowledge the hardships
many foster youths have had to endure, and
to celebrate their persistence and determina-
tion as they navigate a complex system and
transition into adulthood.
In Arkansas, we have almost 5,000 children
currently in the state’s foster care system. As
a Member of the Congressional Caucus on
Foster Youth, I am proud to join them as an
original cosponsor of H. Res. 340, which rec-
ognizes the month of May as National Foster
Care Month.
For the past four years, I have had the
pleasure of a former foster youth personally
shadowing me for a day. This year, I am hon-
ored to host Michaella Halbert, a former foster
youth from my district. The proud mom of two
boys, Michaella is a passionate advocate for
children within the foster care system. Many
foster youths do not have access to a commu-
nity to help support them in finding a career

I am proud to stand with the Congressional

ence firsthand the foundations and principle of
the United States Congress, instilling the char-
acteristics of leadership that they can continue

TRIBUTE TO WISCONSIN SUPREME
COURT JUSTICE SHIRLEY
ABRAHAMSON
HON. GWEN MOORE
OF WISCONSIN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Ms. MOORE. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay
tribute to the career and ongoing legacy of
Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Shirley
Abrahamson, the first woman and longest
serving justice on our state’s highest court.
Born and raised in New York City, Justice
Abrahamson often says, ‘‘At first I intended to
be a teacher, but somewhere around 5 or 6
years old, I decided to be a lawyer, and when
I really looked back to before wanting to be a
teacher, I was going to be President of the
United States, and don’t count me out yet.’’
Her path to the potential presidency led her
to the Indiana Law School in 1953 after grad-
uating magna cum laude from New York Uni-
versity. Justice Abrahamson was one of the
only two women enrolled during a time when
there were not a lot of women in the law prac-
tice. While attending, her fellow classmates
stood in awe of her performance and ability to
recite cases and make arguments. According
to her it was often the gossip amongst the stu-
dents that whoever finished top in the class
would automatically get an offer from large
leading Indianapolis law firms, but the Dean
thought that they wouldn’t hire a woman.
Despite that belief, she persisted, grad-
uating with high distinction from the Indiana
School of Law, she was then hired and quickly
promoted to partner at a law firm in Madison,
Wisconsin. As she continued her private prac-
tice, Justice Abrahamson served as a pro-
fessor at the University of Wisconsin Law
School. Her career would be redirected in
1976 when she was appointed to be an Asso-
ciate Justice on the Wisconsin Supreme
Court. Justice Abrahamson would be repeat-
edly elected to 10-year terms on the bench
with clear majorities each time and would be
later sworn in as Chief Justice of the Wis-
consin Supreme Court in 1996.
When she joined the court, she was given
a voice—a voice that she was never reluctant
to use. At times when our state and court’s
fundamental values were continuously chal-
lenged, she expressed her views off the bench
when necessary. She is an unshakable de-
fender of progressive values, a protector of
victims and a voice who fought against the
special interests, and corporate wrong-doing.
She is a judicial heavyweight, one of the most
respected justices in United States history,
and a trailblazer for women everywhere.
Justice Abrahamson often says that her ac-
complishments are due to the generations of
women who blazed that trail so that she can
walk on it. However, Madam Speaker, in a
time when very few women were in the law
practice, she took that risk, picked up the
mantle and continued to pave the way so
women like myself, in this Congress and
across the nation could walk on it. As Justice
Abrahamson heads to retirement, her absence
will leave a void in our state, but the legacy
she leaves behind will inspire generations to
come.
Madam Speaker, Justice Shirley Abraham-
son has helped change the course of Amer-
ican History for the better, and I applaud her
for everything she has contributed to the state
of Wisconsin and our nation.
IN RECOGNITION OF MELISA D.
MONTEMAYOR
HON. HENRY CUELLAR
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, June 4, 2019
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, Melisa D.
Montemayor was born in Duval County,
Texas, and graduated from the University of
Texas at Austin in 1990 with a bachelor’s de-
gree in biology.
Mrs. Montemayor served the state of Texas
for 29 years, including the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department and the Texas Depart-
ment of Transportation (TxDOT). Mrs.
Montemayor also worked as the Laredo Dis-
trict Advance Transportation Planning Director
and managed long-range and short-range
transportation planning for the district. She
also arranged transportation improvement
plans with the Laredo Metropolitan Planning
Organization.
Through her extensive work with local and
federal legislators, consulting firms, and fellow
TxDOT staff, she developed essential projects
for Laredo and the state of Texas. For her ef-
forts she received the U.S. Department of
Transportation’s ‘‘Design for Transportation
2000 National Award’’ and the Texas Depart-
ment of Transportation Environmental
Achievement Award.
Mrs. Montemayor’s involvement has been
essential to the Laredo community. I have
confidence that she will continue to aid her
community in any way she can and I wish her
well on her retirement. Today, Mrs.
Montemayor lives in Laredo, Texas with her
husband, Adrian, and their daughter, Ari.
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to recog-
nize Mrs. Montemayor and her outstanding ca-
reer.
