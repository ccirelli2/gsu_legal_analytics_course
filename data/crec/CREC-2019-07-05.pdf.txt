CONGRATULATING THE UNIVER-
SITY OF VIRGINIA CYBER DE-
FENSE TEAM
HON. DENVER RIGGLEMAN
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, July 5, 2019
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Madam Speaker, con-
gratulations to the University of Virginia Cyber
Defense Team on their national championship
victory at the 2019 National Collegiate Cyber
Defense Championship.
The students won the Alamo Cup by defeat-
ing 139 other teams over the course of the
competition. The NCCDC is a competition built
to simulate the defense of cyber security net-
works. Each student team assumes adminis-
trative and protective duties for an existing
‘‘commercial’’ network and is responsible for
protecting the network and responding to out-
side threats. I am proud that these UVa stu-
dents are taking the lead to protect our econ-
omy and keep our nation safe and I look for-
ward to what they will accomplish in their blos-
soming careers.
These future leaders showcased their deter-
mination, ingenuity, and teamwork to bring
home their second national title in as many
years. Congratulations to the University of Vir-
ginia students for their continued leadership.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EAST
ST. LOUIS AMERICAN LEGION
POST 53
HON. MIKE BOST
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, July 5, 2019
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the 100th anniversary of East St. Louis
American Legion Post 53. During the last cen-
tury, this post has provided countless local
veterans with services, support, and fellow-
ship. Such commitment to our heroes has
helped the American Legion become one of
the largest non-profit organizations in the
United States.
After World War I ended with the signing of
the Armistice in November 1918, veterans
came back to America wanting to remain a
close-knit community. After Congress char-
tered the American Legion later that year,
Post 53 in East St. Louis became a pillar of
the national organization. As a Marine and the
father of a Marine, I am so grateful for all of
the work the American Legion at Post 53 has
done over the years to bring our heroes to-
gether and ensure they receive the benefits
they deserve.
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing this momentous occasion and com-
mend the East St. Louis American Legion
Post 53 for the great achievements they have
achieved over the last 100 years.

HONORING DALE DERR ON HIS RE-
TIREMENT AS DIRECTOR OF
VETERANS AFFAIRS FOR BERKS
COUNTY
HON. DANIEL MEUSER
OF PENNSYLVANIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, July 5, 2019
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is with
great respect and admiration that I rise today
to honor Berks County Director of Veterans
Affairs, Dale Derr. After 43 years serving our
country and making an impact in our commu-
nity, Dale is retiring this July.
Dale’s commitment to service is remarkable.
Beginning his military service in 1976 in the
Marine Corps, Dale would spend 24 years in
uniform, retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel in the
Air Force in 2000. As Director of Veterans Af-
fairs for the last nine years, Dale has earned
a reputation for his commitment to community
and for getting things done for veterans and
their families. He has touched countless lives
in this capacity, helping veterans access bene-
fits, supporting families, and organizing the na-
tion’s oldest Armed Forces Day Parade. Dale
leaves an incredible legacy in Berks County
and an unmatched example of public service
for our community.
Dale, his wife, Susan, and their family rep-
resent the very best in community service. I
ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing
Dale Derr for his decades of dedicated service
to our country, to our veterans, and for his
many contributions to the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania and Berks County. I wish him
the best as he enters this next chapter in life.
f
REMEMBERING THE LIFE AND
LEGACY OF DAVID MARCUS
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, July 5, 2019
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to remember the life and legacy of Mr.
David Marcus, a larger-than-life personality,
passionate supporter of our community, and a
great friend to many, who passed away on
June 28, 2019 after his seventh battle with
cancer. A resident of Bakersfield, California,
David will be remembered throughout our
community for his contagious positive attitude,
his dedicated faith in God, and his ubiquitous
presence—he was known locally as ‘‘Mr. Ba-
kersfield.’’
David was born on December 22, 1958 in
Passaic, New Jersey, and later moved to Ba-
kersfield. He developed his job skills working
at the Bakersfield Association of Retarded Citi-
zens and quickly found a career working at
Albertson’s, where he inspired everyone he
met. David was often seen cheering on dif-
ferent high school sports teams, like his
niece’s Centennial Golden Hawks. With his
can-do spirit and positive attitude, David quick-
ly became known for being their biggest sup-
porter, cheering on our community’s student-
athletes as they competed for championships.
Despite his cancer diagnosis, David was con-
stantly at games, events, and community cele-
brations, sharing the power of positivity with
everyone he came in contact with. In recogni-
tion of this, he was announced as the winner
of the 2018 Greatest Community Supporter
Award, which was presented to him by the
Kern High School District.
David, a loud supporter of everything Ba-
kersfield, would make friends anywhere he
went as he cheered on and championed dif-
ferent events in the community. From wel-
coming home veterans as they returned from
an Honor Flight to cheering on players with
disabilities during the League of Dreams to at-
tending our community’s annual Relay for Life,
David was someone our community united
around. In fact, in just a few days, members
of the Bakersfield community came together to
raise money to ensure that he received a star
on the historic Fox Theatre’s Walk-of-Fame in
downtown Bakersfield.
For those of us lucky enough to call him a
friend, it was not surprising to see that David
never lost his vision of the power of positivity
and prayer. David prayed for everyone in his
family, our community, and even for the mem-
bers of this legislative body, asking that we be
given the wisdom to make the right decisions
for our country. Despite battling cancer seven
times, David never became angry or bitter. In-
stead his warm, positive personality shined
brighter than ever as the battles got longer
and tougher. He will be remembered as a war-
rior who never gave up and fought valiantly
until the end. On behalf of California’s 23rd
Congressional District, I want to extend my
most heartfelt condolences to David’s family,
including his sister Arlene and husband Virgil;
his sister Debbie and husband George; his
nieces Bee, Alexandria, and GloriAnn; and his
nephews George, Gino, and Guy.
David’s life, actions, and love for his com-
munity will undoubtedly continue to inspire us,
as will his words: Thumbs Up, Cancer Down.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DR.
GERALD V. CAMMACK
HON. BRIAN BABIN
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, July 5, 2019
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life of Dr. Gerald V. ‘‘Jerry’’
Cammack, a United States Air Force Veteran,
long-time dentist, and integral member of the
Southeast Texas community. Jerry passed
away on June 26, 2019 at the age of 79.
Dr. Cammack was born in Jasper, Texas
and lived most of his life in Pineland, Texas.
In high school, Jerry graduated as the valedic-
torian of his class at Pineland High School in
1958. After graduation, he received a basket-
ball scholarship from Lamar University. After
finishing his undergraduate degree, Jerry
moved to Houston, Texas to attend the Uni-
versity of Texas Dental Branch.
While a dental student, Jerry met and mar-
ried the love of his life, Glenda Sanders. After
completing his degree, he joined the United
States Air Force and served as a Captain from
1967 to 1969. When his tour of duty was over,
he moved back to Jasper, Texas to start both
his dental practice and a family. After 39 years
of dedicated service to his clients, Dr.
Cammack turned the business over to his son
and enjoyed a life of retirement doing the
things he loved, like spending time with his
family. Dr. Cammack is survived by his wife,
Glenda Cammack, their two sons, Dr. Van
Cammack and Decker Cammack, and four
grandchildren.
Dr. Cammack leaves a special legacy of
service to his neighbors through his dentistry
and his friendship to all in the community. He
was a great friend to me, and I will miss him
dearly.
Madam Speaker, my prayers and condo-
lences are with the family, friends, and com-
munity of Dr. Gerald V. Cammack.
