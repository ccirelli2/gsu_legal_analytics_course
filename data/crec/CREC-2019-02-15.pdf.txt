Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life of an American hero,
Bloyce Bradford, who passed away at 90
years old on Tuesday, January 29, 2019.
Mr. Bradford was born Christmas Day in
1928. He went on to enroll in the Army, where
he served during the Korean War. While in
Korea, Mr. Bradford was wounded multiple
times and, at one point, was considered miss-
ing in action. According to Mr. Bradford’s son,
for more than 30 days, Mr. Bradford avoided
capture and eventually was able to find his
way back to the American forces. Mr. Bradford
received the Purple Heart and several other
military awards for his distinguished service.
After his retirement from the Armed Forces,
Mr. Bradford started his own business in
Northeast El Paso, showcasing his entrepre-
neurial drive and his commitment to the com-
munity.
Mr. Bradford will be remembered as one of
the oldest-living veterans in El Paso and be-
loved by many across the city who will miss
his mentorship and kindness. His legacy lives
on through his sister Gwendolyn, his five chil-
dren and their families, as well as his com-
panion of 43 years and her family. The El
Paso community mourns his loss and thanks
him for his contributions to our nation.

COMMEMORATING THE ONE HUN-
DREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE
TIOGA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
HON. TOM REED
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, February 15, 2019
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
commemorate the one hundredth anniversary
of the Tioga County Chamber of Commerce.
On June 4, 1919, citizens of Tioga County
joined together and signed a charter to create
the Owego Chamber of Commerce. The char-
ter stated that the purpose of the corporation
would be to promote the general welfare of
Owego and the surrounding communities.
Even though their name may be different
these one hundred years later, their mission
remains the same.
The Owego Chamber of Commerce began
as a corporation to encourage the growth of
business in the Greater Owego area through
the management of real estate. By purchasing
properties and then improving those prop-
erties, the Chamber helped to create environ-
ments that welcomed new businesses.
As the times have changed, so has the
Chamber. In its early years, it overcame the
adversity of the Great Depression and worked
to help their community through economic
struggles. During World War II, the Chamber
assisted with the selling of war bonds to aid in
the war effort. Today, the Chamber continues
a tradition started in 1999 with their annual
business show. The business show brings
new businesses and existing businesses to-
gether, putting them in contact with each other
and the general public.
One hundred years of service to the com-
munity is certainly a cause for celebration. I
congratulate the Tioga County Chamber of
Commerce for their impressive record of hard
work and look forward to many more years of
them supporting businesses in our commu-
nities.
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to
celebrate the Tioga County Chamber of Com-
merce’s one hundred years of service.
