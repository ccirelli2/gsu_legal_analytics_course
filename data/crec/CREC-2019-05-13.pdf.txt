PRAYER
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer:
Let us pray.
God of our destinies, keep our spirits
attuned to the graciousness of Your
loving providence. Deliver us from
emotions and actions that thwart Your
purposes for our lives.
Lord, guide our lawmakers and en-
gender in them a spirit of unity, as
they respect the integrity and patriot-
ism of their colleagues.
Give us the wisdom to use this day to
strive to do Your will on Earth even as
it is done in Heaven. As You show us
the way to advance Your Kingdom on
Earth, provide us with goodness and
mercy, wisdom and strength.
We pray in Your mighty Name.
Amen.

HAWLEY). The Senator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

VETERANS HISTORY PROJECT
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I
would like to tell my colleagues in the
Senate about a project I worked on in
Iowa on getting history from various
veterans.
This morning, I delivered 20 stories
from veterans to the Veterans History
Project at our Library of Congress.
These stories will be preserved in the
permanent collection of the Library of
Congress, making accessible the per-
sonal accounts of American war vet-
erans so that future generations may
hear directly from veterans and better
understand the realities of war.
I want to thank all of our veterans,
including those who were interviewed,
who have sacrificed for the defense of
our freedoms. Their service ensures
that all Americans will live in peace
and prosperity for generations to come.
f
NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, May
is National Foster Care Month.
Due to the opioid crisis and other
substance abuse issues plaguing com-
munities in Iowa and all across Amer-
ica, the number of kids in foster care is
rapidly rising. In 2017, there were
443,000 kids in care. Ninety-six thou-
sand entered foster care because of pa-
rental substance abuse.
These families need help. That is why
Congress passed the Family First Pre-
vention Services Act, which will allow
States to receive Federal reimburse-
ment for services to help keep kids
with their parents. These services in-
clude substance abuse treatment pro-
grams.
As we celebrate this month of May as
National Foster Care Month, I hope we
will think about the number of kids
who are there and do what we can to
help those kids have permanency and
parents. As chairman of the Caucus on
Foster Youth, those are the two things
I hear from them when listening to
them talk about going from foster
home to foster home, sometimes two or
three times a year. They tell me they
would like to have parents and they
would like to have a home. They want
stability.
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa.
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this
week marks National Police Week,
which is dedicated to the brave men
and women of law enforcement. Police
officers prioritize the safety of their
neighbors and fellow citizens above
their own.
This week gives us an opportunity to
reflect on the dedication and persever-
ance of law enforcement officers across
the country. We should also honor
those who made the ultimate sacrifice
while serving our communities. It is
because of the commitment and brav-
ery of police officers, firefighters, first
responders, and other public safety of-
ficers that we can feel safe in our
homes, places of work, and our commu-
nities.
I am particularly grateful for the
men and women in blue who serve my
fellow Iowans.
I would also like to thank the offi-
cers who serve in Washington, DC. The
Capitol Police work diligently every
day to ensure that those of us who
work here and everyone who visits this
Capitol are safe. Each member of the
Capitol Police works selflessly to pro-
tect us, and their dedication to service
doesn’t go unnoticed.
National Police Week serves as a re-
minder to thank specific members of
law enforcement whom we know and
care about; however, we can’t forget to
honor those who sacrificed their lives
to protect ours. These individuals are
heroes.
According to the National Law En-
forcement Officers Memorial Fund, a
total of 1,582 officers died in the line of
duty during the past 10 years. That is
an average of one death every 55 hours.
In 2018, 158 officers were killed in the
line of duty.
At the National Law Enforcement Of-
ficers Memorial, the names of some 200
Iowans are inscribed amongst those
who made the ultimate sacrifice. Each
name represents a unique individual
who answered the call of duty. We are
indebted to each and every one of those
people.
To that end, I am pleased that the
Senate Judiciary Committee recently
approved three bills, two of which I co-
sponsored and one that I introduced.
My bill, the Protecting America’s
First Responder’s Act, seeks to fix
issues in the Federal Public Safety Of-
ficers’ Benefits Program. Officers
whose lives have been transformed by
injury in the line of duty deserve our
support, and that bill lends to their
support and makes sure that it is actu-
ally accomplished. Unfortunately, the
Federal program that was created to
assist them has fallen short in respond-
ing to claims efficiently. This impor-
tant bill improves this program to en-
sure that disabled or fallen officers re-
ceive the benefits they deserve.
My bill enjoys the wide support of
multiple groups, including the Fra-
ternal Order of Police, Federal Law En-
forcement Officers Association, Ser-
geants Benevolent Association, Na-
tional Association of Police Organiza-
tions, Peace Officers Research Associa-
tion of California, Wounded Blue,
How2LoveOurCops, Billings Montana
Police Department, National Volunteer
Fire Council, National Association of
School Resource Officers, and the Vio-
lently Injured Police Officers Organiza-
tion.
I look forward to passing this bill
into law, and I thank all of the bill’s
cosponsors for helping to move this bill
forward.
In addition to the Protecting Amer-
ica’s First Responder’s Act, we also
moved two other bills out of the Judi-
ciary Committee.
The first is the Patrick Leahy Bullet-
proof Vest Partnership Grant Program
reauthorization. This bill allows State
and local law enforcement officers to
purchase lifesaving bulletproof vests
for those officers working in the field.
I am happy to cosponsor this legisla-
tion and support my colleague Senator
LEAHY’s tireless efforts to improve the
availability of bulletproof vests to our
police.
The other bill that passed out of
committee last week is the Supporting
and Treating Officers in Crisis Act.
Mental illness and suicide among po-
lice officers continue to grow. Senator
HAWLEY introduced this bill, and I am
proud to cosponsor it with him because
it addresses a critical issue that far too
many officers face. This bill seeks to
provide necessary resources to law en-
forcement on mental health and sui-
cide prevention.
I urge my colleagues to support all
three of these bills. Passing them into
law is one way to say thank you to the
brave men and women who serve us so
selflessly.
I would like to conclude my remarks
by once again thanking all members of
law enforcement for their dedication
and sacrifice.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, this
week the Senate will continue to
promptly and reasonably consider a
number of well-qualified nominees for
important positions.
Several weeks ago we put an end to 2
years of unprecedented, systematic
partisan obstruction that had kept
abundantly qualified nominees on the
sidelines for no substantive reason. The
Senate took a modest but important
step to turn back toward the institu-
tional traditions that had shaped our
work in nominations throughout our
history. We put in place a reform to
speed up the postcloture floor time
that we spend debating on lower level
nominations—or, in many cases, I
should say, supposedly debating them.
Since then we have been able to fill
several important posts in the execu-
tive branch, along with seats on the
bench, at a more reasonable pace. In
many cases, these unobjectionable can-
didates have received the over-
whelming support they deserve—90 to
8, 90 to 8, 95 to 3.
Over the next few days, four more
will receive consideration on the floor.
We will begin by processing the first of
two more well-qualified nominees to
our Nation’s district courts, such as
Michael J. Truncale, of Texas, to serve
as U.S. district judge for the Eastern
District of Texas.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2777
May 13, 2019
Mr. Truncale is a graduate of Lamar
University, the University of North
Texas, and the Southern Methodist
University School of Law. Over more
than three decades of private practice,
he has amassed a distinguished record
in both litigation and appellate law. In
addition, Mr. Truncale has served on
the board of regents for the Texas
State University System and the Texas
Prepaid Higher Education Tuition
Board in the Texas Comptroller’s Of-
fice.
His nomination has earned a well-
qualified rating from the ABA and has
twice been favorably reported by our
colleagues on the Judiciary Com-
mittee. So I hope each of our col-
leagues will join me and add Mr.
Truncale’s nomination to the growing
list of uncontroversial nominees passed
in an orderly, bipartisan fashion.
Following consideration of the
Truncale nomination, we will vote on
Kenneth Lee’s nomination to the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals and Wendy
Vitter’s nomination to serve as U.S.
District Judge for the Eastern District
of Louisiana.
Then we will consider the nomina-
tion of Brian Bulatao, of Texas, to
serve as Under Secretary of State for
Management. This is, effectively, the
COO job at the Department of State,
responsible for such critical things as
embassy security. His nomination was
first submitted to the Senate in June
of 2018, nearly a year ago.
Following those four individuals, the
Senate will also consider this week the
nomination of Jeffrey Rosen to serve
as our next Deputy Attorney General.
Mr. Rosen is a graduate of North-
western University and Harvard Law
School. He built a strong record in pri-
vate practice as a litigator before en-
tering public service in 2003. Prior to
his current position, he has served as
the Deputy Secretary at the Depart-
ment of Transportation and at the Of-
fice of Management and Budget and as
an adjunct professor at the Georgetown
University Law Center.
The American people deserve that
their Department of Justice be fully
staffed, fully operational, and fully
committed to upholding our Nation’s
laws. So I hope that each of my col-
leagues reviews this impressive nomi-
nee and then votes to confirm him this
week.
DISASTER RELIEF
Mr. President, as we continue our ef-
forts in the personnel business, work is
also ongoing to reach an agreement for
providing supplemental relief funding
to communities hit hard by natural
disasters.
Last year’s deadly hurricane season
swept away thousands of homes across
the Southeast and left hundreds of
thousands more without power. The re-
cent spate of tornadoes killed 23 and
injured dozens more in Alabama and
Georgia, and the devastating floods
created more than $1 billion of damage
to homes, businesses, and infrastruc-
ture all across the Midwest this spring.
Bipartisan efforts are ongoing to pro-
vide aid to cover those in need—from
our Territories to those who suffered
west coast wildfires and east coast hur-
ricanes. Disaster assistance in the past
has not been a partisan issue. It has
been over a half-year since many of
these disasters hit, and our country is
in need.
I am grateful to Chairman SHELBY
and our colleagues on the Appropria-
tions Committee for continuing to
push toward a bipartisan solution that
addresses these most urgent needs. I
would urge Democrats and Repub-
licans, in the House as well as the Sen-
ate, to identify our common ground
and produce an outcome for the Amer-
ican people. They have been waiting
entirely too long.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I
ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.

dered.
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
Democratic leader is recognized.
FOREIGN ELECTION INTERFERENCE
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
Secretary of State Pompeo will meet
with Vladimir Putin tomorrow, and
there is something important he must
do.
The Mueller report, for all its revela-
tions about the President’s conduct,
also reminded us of things we know to
be true and must resist at all costs.
The Mueller report documented the
‘‘sweeping and systematic’’
disinformation campaign directed by
President Putin to undermine our 2016
elections. Whatever you may think of
the President’s behavior, foreign inter-
ference in our elections cannot be ig-
nored.
It was an attack on democracy itself,
and in my view, America’s response has
not been adequate. What happened in
the past has happened, as bad as it was,
but the point of looking at this is to
prevent it from ever happening again
in the future. We don’t know what
country will try to change our elec-
tions and who it might support—Rus-
sia, China, Iran, North Korea. So we
have to bolster ourselves, and until we
get a full, full description of what hap-
pened and a plan to stop it from hap-
pening in 2020, America should not rest
because it is an attack on democracy
itself.
America’s response, thus far, has not
been adequate. Congress passed sanc-
tions, but then President Trump failed
to implement some and watered others
down. Only a few months ago, the
Treasury Department cut a sweetheart
deal on sanctions relief for Russian oli-
garch and Putin crony Oleg Deripaska.
Even rhetorically, the President and
members of his administration have
shown an unbelievable willingness to
look past President Putin’s actions of
2016. A little over a week ago, just after
the Mueller report came out, President
Trump held a phone call with President
Putin in which he reportedly brought
up the Russian hoax, and he did not
warn Putin not to meddle in our elec-
tions. Of course, the press conference
in Helsinki last year was the epitome
of President Trump’s inability to con-
front President Putin about his inter-
ference in our elections.
This matters a great deal because
any softness on the administration’s
part will be read by Putin and other
foreign powers as an invitation to try
and interfere with our elections again.
We know, thanks to the testimony
from FBI Director Wray and our na-
tional intelligence chiefs, that foreign
adversaries are gearing up right now to
try again and interfere with our elec-
tions in 2020. Yet it may not be just
Russia next time; it might be China,
North Korea, or Iran. Who knows?
So it is long past time for the Trump
administration to make it crystal clear
that another interference campaign by
Putin will not be tolerated. The Sec-
retary of State, Michael Pompeo, has
an obligation to warn President Putin
that any action to interfere in our elec-
tions will be met with an immediate
and robust response. Secretary of State
Pompeo must make clear that the cost
of trying to interfere with American
elections will be dear. Secretary of
State Pompeo must deliver a shot
across the bow to Putin and any other
foreign adversary who would dare
think about trying to influence our
elections. Anything else from Sec-
retary Pompeo will be a failure of di-
plomacy.
Here in Congress, our response must
also be strong. In the wake of multiple
warnings about future election inter-
ference, we must do everything we can
to harden our election infrastructure
before 2020. There are multiple bills—
bipartisan, sponsored by Democrats
and Republicans—that are in com-
mittee right now that would do just
that, but Leader MCCONNELL will not
commit to bringing them to the floor,
which is another example of his legisla-
tive graveyard. Instead, he just sched-
ules nomination after nomination. This
is now the third week in a row that the
Senate will spend processing only
nominations. Leader MCCONNELL is,
slowly but surely, changing the Cham-
ber into a legislative graveyard, where
even the most urgently needed, bipar-
tisan bills on election security and
Russia sanctions get buried.
HEALTHCARE
Madam President, on healthcare, it is
not just election security, of course,
that finds itself in the McConnell
graveyard. Bipartisan bills, like back-
ground checks, paycheck fairness, and
the Violence Against Women Act, have
all passed the House with Republican
support but have languished in the
Senate. I wouldn’t be surprised if
healthcare legislation will soon be

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2778 May 13, 2019
added to the list of tombstones in
Leader MCCONNELL’s graveyard.
At the end of last week, the House
passed a crucial piece of legislation
that would reverse the Trump adminis-
tration’s attempts to weaken protec-
tions for Americans with preexisting
conditions—a policy supported by the
vast majority of Americans and pub-
licly supported by several State Senate
Republicans who are up for reelection.
This week, the House is poised to pass
another great package of healthcare
legislation to further protect pre-
existing conditions and help people
sign up for quality healthcare cov-
erage.
Compare that to the Trump adminis-
tration’s policies, which have only in-
creased costs and lowered the number
of Americans who have health insur-
ance. The uninsured rate had been on a
steady decline until President Trump
took office. Now, for the first time
since 2013, the number of Americans
without insurance has been on the rise.
As the leader of the majority in the
Senate, Senator MCCONNELL has a re-
sponsibility to use our time here to
help the American people. As insurance
rates fall, protections for preexisting
conditions are under attack, and prices
go up for middle-class Americans. I be-
lieve the Senate must act to improve
the Nation’s healthcare system, and we
have multiple House-passed bills await-
ing action. Leader MCCONNELL need
only call them up for debate. Instead,
the legislative graveyard—where good
legislation doesn’t even get debated or
amended, let alone passed—is upon us.
PUERTO RICO
Madam President, finally, on disaster
relief, last week, our colleagues in the
House passed yet another bill that
would provide crucial aid for disaster-
stricken communities, including for
our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico who
are still suffering. Importantly, the bill
passed with 34 Republicans voting in
favor.
Negotiations on a disaster package
continue, but I believe the House vote
is a sign that the Republicans in both
Chambers are beginning to realize the
people of Puerto Rico cannot be left be-
hind—and rightly so. There will not be
any bill if it doesn’t treat all of Amer-
ica fairly.
Don’t complain just about your
State. Go to those in the Republican
leadership, if you are a Republican
Senator, and tell them we must pass a
bill that protects everybody.
The President’s animus for the peo-
ple of Puerto Rico is antithetical to
our values as Americans. Americans
help each other in times of need. We
wouldn’t shortchange the farmers in
Iowa or the people of Texas or Cali-
fornia or Florida. So why should we
ask 3 million fellow citizens—the peo-
ple of Puerto Rico, I remind my col-
leagues, who are U.S. citizens—to keep
waiting for help to rebuild from a
storm that made landfall over a year
and a half ago? The bottom line is very
simple: We have to help everybody.
Our Republican colleagues are begin-
ning to realize their constituents are
complaining and asking, what is the
holdup? We all know the story. It
wasn’t the original idea of the Repub-
licans in the Senate to treat Puerto
Rico unfairly. President Trump came
to a lunch and demanded that aid for
Puerto Rico be eliminated or greatly
diminished, and our Republican friends
went along. They thought we would
just bow down as they did, and we have
not neither in the House nor in the
Senate.
Now let’s get moving. It is encour-
aging that the Republicans are begin-
ning to realize that Puerto Rico needs
help or that it at least has to be a part
of the aid package. I hope these green
shoots soon bear fruit, and we can send
something to the President’s desk and
give relief to all of those who need it in
California, Texas, Iowa, Nebraska, Ala-
bama, Florida, and Puerto Rico.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

TRIBUTE TO DEAN LEWIS
Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, we
are called upon many times to do many
things in this Chamber, and in 21 years
I have been called to do a lot of dif-
ferent things, but today may be the
most different of all.
In a way, it is something that is a joy
to do. It is about a place in Bartow
County, GA, in White, GA, a small
rural town that is being caught by the
urban growth of the city of Atlanta,
one of the biggest cities in the United
States of America. White, GA, is a
great town. The first Sunday of every
month, there is a breakfast at 7 a.m.
for the guys in town, where we all go
and talk politics, talk about the future
of the county, talk about what is hap-
pening, share good and bad ideas, tell
jokes for the week, and come back a
month later to see how things are
going. It is something I relish doing. It
is something I started doing because I
am a politician. You go where two or
more are gathered, and you go to talk
to them and to try to get them to know
you and to make sure they know you
are on the ballot the next time.
I have been in politics a long time—
41 years. I have learned a lot of things.
I have learned that in politics the best
thing to know is your next-door neigh-
bor and people. The best thing for them
to know is to know you.
But I also learned some interesting
things about our economy and about
business. The No. 2 producer of revenue
to our governments around the country
is revenue off of tourism. Tourism is
the No. 2 industry in the country in
terms of revenue at the local level—for
sales and use taxes, for bed taxes, for
hotel-motel taxes, for entertainment
taxes, and for all kinds of taxes. They
generate money to help our cities and
counties buy and build facilities that
attract tourism to come in the future,
whether it is convocation centers, edu-
cational centers, or whatever.
I am always paying close attention
everywhere I go to see what somebody
new is doing around the country that
we might not have done in Georgia be-
fore. But I have been sitting on a ham
sandwich, starving to death, because
every first Sunday of every month,
when I go to the breakfast in White
County, GA, I am going to something
that is exactly that, unique to the
country. So I thought I would bring it
to the floor of the Senate today and
tell you a little bit about it.
It is about a guy named Dean Lewis
and Dean’s family’s home place.
Dean’s family’s home place is in
Bartow County, GA. Dean grew up on a
piece of property that in 2009 was a
junkyard. It was just a junkyard of old
cars—in fact, 40 years’ worth of old
cars. There was kudzu. I don’t know if
the Presiding Officer knows what
kudzu is. The South is full of it. It was
a great idea to stop erosion, but it was
a horrible idea because you can’t kill
it. It just gets bigger and bigger. We
have 40 years’ worth of kudzu that has
grown through these cars, wrecked
tractors, buses, and everything. They
are almost canopy hidden by the
kudzu.
Dean Lewis was sitting on the front
porch of his house, looking across the
street at what he has now named Old
Car City, and said: You know, that
would be an interesting place for peo-
ple to come and visit, because people
are always looking for parts on old cars
that they might get to help restore the
old cars they have.
It started out as just a place where
people who wanted to come and tear
some old parts off of an old car to fix
their jalopy or their old car would
come and get them from Dean.
One day Dean had somebody come
from the Atlanta Ballet and said: You
know, this would be a big, great back-
ground for our ballerinas in a photo
contest to talk about how agile they
are.
So the Atlanta Ballet used the back-
drop of Old Car City for photos for
their calendar a few years ago. The At-
lanta Falcons have used it. All kinds of
businesses have used it. Businesses
from around the world have used it. It
has become a famous place. It is not a
famous place because it is handsome or
beautiful. It is not famous because it is
famous but because it is unique.
Dean Lewis and his family took
something of theirs that was unique to

the same thing with Old Car City. They
took a useless, rusted-out old junkyard
and turned it into something people
would want to come to see, someplace
where they would want to come to get
old parts for cars or come to get their
pictures taken with the cars. Inter-
national companies want to come to do
business there, to where it is now one
of the most attractive places we have
in North Georgia.
I thought I would come to the well
for no other reason but to pay tribute
to Dean Lewis in White, GA, because
he has taken an old car in a junkyard—
a jalopy—and turned it into something
that raises money for the community,
that memorializes our heritage and our
past, that takes the use of something
everybody thought was wasted and
turns it into something good. If we can
always try to do that, as well as make
something new good, then we would all
be doing well as business people, as
tourist promoters, and as builders of
local government.
I rise tonight to commend Dean
Lewis on what he and his family have
done, to commend Old Car City on
what has turned into a great money-
making project for the State and for
our local property—the tourist attrac-
tion they have created there—and to
tell them to keep on doing the work
and making chicken salad out of good
fried chicken. Georgia chicken is the
best that you can have, and there is no
better chicken than a junkyard in
Georgia called Old Car City.
God bless you.

RECOGNIZING THE 54TH ANNIVERSARY OF HEAD
START AND THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF EARLY
HEAD START
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to
celebrate the 54th anniversary of Head
Start and the 25th anniversary of Early
Head Start on May 18.
We know that in January of 1964,
President Lyndon Baines Johnson de-
clared the War on Poverty in his State
of the Union Address. Sargent Shriver,
who was the then-Director of the Office
of Economic Opportunity, assembled a
panel of experts to develop a com-
prehensive child development program
to help communities meet the needs of
disadvantaged preschool children. It
resulted in Project Head Start’s
launching in the summer of 1965.
Over 50 years later, Head Start and
Early Head Start have served hundreds
of thousands of children with high-
quality, comprehensive early learning
and wraparound services. Just to give
the Senate a reminder of what Head
Start is in terms of the ages, Head
Start serves children who are ages 3 to
5. Early Head Start serves children who
are up to the age of 3—so under the age
of 3.
We know that these early learning
experiences provide children with the
tools they need to develop and succeed
in school. When children learn more
earlier in life, they earn more later in
life. It is not just a rhyme. All the evi-
dence and research show that there is a
direct connection between early learn-
ing and later earning. A study of Head
Start children in Harrisburg, PA, found
that they had higher scores in the fifth
grade than a control group on all aca-
demic and executive functioning out-
comes.
These benefits stay with children
through adulthood. Research shows
Head Start children have a higher like-
lihood of graduating from high school
and receiving postsecondary degrees.
These benefits even flow to the next
generation. The children of Head Start
graduates are significantly more likely
to finish high school and enroll in col-
lege, and they are significantly less
likely to become teen parents or to be
involved in the criminal justice sys-
tem.
One of the core tenets of Head Start
that has made it so successful is its re-
sponsiveness to local community
needs. In Pennsylvania, for example, as
in many other States, the opioid epi-
demic has hit far too many commu-
nities, and Head Start has responded to
that crisis with innovative program-
ming.
For example, the SafeStart Program
in Allentown, which is an Early Head
Start program, provides early interven-
tion to assist the development of in-
fants and toddlers who have suffered
abuse or neglect. After having com-
pleted SafeStart—the new program in
Allentown—68 percent of 3-year-olds
were on age developmentally, and 100
percent of the children showed signifi-
cant improvement in their drug-im-
pacted symptoms, with 53 percent hav-
ing shown resolution. Of the women
who became pregnant while their sub-
stance-impacted children were enrolled
in SafeStart, 88 percent gave birth to
full-term, drug-free, and healthy sec-
ond children.
The whole family approach and inte-
gration with local community partners

have created not just better outcomes
for families but have resulted in sig-
nificant savings. Through this pro-
gram, 91 percent of the children
achieved stable, permanent homes and
caregivers, and it is estimated that the
SafeStart Program has resulted in
nearly $1.5 million in foster care sav-
ings and in over $9.5 million in child
welfare involvement by stabilizing 106
families. So we are grateful for those
results from the SafeStart Program in
Allentown.
Head Start is a critical program for
lifting families out of poverty, obvi-
ously, and providing children with the
early learning experiences they need to
start kindergarten and to be ready to
learn. Unfortunately, only about a
third of eligible children still have ac-
cess to Head Start, and less than 10
percent—these are national numbers—
have access to Early Head Start.
Again, Early Head Start serves those
who are up to 3 years old, and Head
Start serves those who are 3 to 5 years
old. So funding for these programs is
critical.
To give you an example of those
numbers in Pennsylvania—and the
numbers are even a little lower—just 27
percent of eligible 3- to 5-year-olds
have access to Head Start, and only 7
percent of eligible children under 3
years old have access to Early Head
Start. Even with a lot of children being
eligible but not being served, this is
purely a question of funding.
As we celebrate over 50 years of Head
Start on May 18, we must work to en-
sure these programs receive robust
funding and continue to serve low-in-
come children and families across the
Nation.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION
Oatar—AH–64E Apache Helicopters with
Spare Parts and Related Equipment
The Government of Qatar has requested to
buy twenty-four (24) AH–64E Apache Attack
helicopters; fifty-two (52) T700–GE–701D en-
gines (2 per aircraft, 4 spares); twenty-six (26)
AN/ASQ–170 Modernized Target Acquisition
and Designation Sight (MTADS) (1 per air-
craft, 2 spares); twenty-six (26) AN/AAQ–11
Modernized Pilot Night Vision Sensors (1 per
aircraft, 2 spare); eight (8) AN/APG–78 Fire
Control Radars (FCR) with Radar Elec-
tronics Unit (LONGBOW component); eight
(8) AN/APR–48 Modernized-Radar Frequency
Interferometers (MRFI); twenty-nine (29)
AN/AAR–57 Common Missile Warning Sys-
tem (CMWS) (1 per aircraft, 5 spares); fifty-
eight (58) Embedded Global Positioning Sys-
tems with Inertial Navigation (EGI) (2 per
aircraft, 10 spares); two thousand five hun-
dred (2,500) AGM–114R Hellfire missiles; and
twenty-five (25) Hellfire Captive Air Training
Missiles (CATM) (1 per aircraft, 1 spare).
Also included are twenty-eight (28) 30mm
automatic chain guns (1 per aircraft, 4
spares), AN/AVR–2B laser detecting sets, AN/
APR–39 Radar Signal Detecting Sets, AN/
AVS–6 Night Vision Goggles, M299 Hellfire
missile launchers, 2.75 inch Hydra Rockets,
30mm cartridges, CCU–44 impulse cartridges,
M206 and 211 countermeasure flares, M230
automatic guns and associated components,
2.75 inch rocket launcher tubes, AN/ARC–231
and AN/ARC–201D radios with associated
components, AN/APX–123 transponders,
image intensifiers, MUMT2i systems, AN/
ARN–153 tactical airborne navigation sys-
tems, chaff, spare an repair parts, support
equipment, training and training equipment,
U.S. Government and contractor engineer-
ing, technical, and logistics support services,
and other related elements of logistics and
program support. The estimated cost is $3.0
billion.
This proposed sale will support the foreign
policy and national security of the United
States by helping to improve the security of
a friendly country that continues to be an
important force for political and economic
progress in the Middle East. Qatar is host to
the U.S. Central Command forces and serves
as a critical forward-deployed location in the
region. The acquisition of these helicopters
will allow for integration with U.S. forces for
training exercises, which contributes to re-
gional security and interoperability.
The proposed sale of the AH–64E Apache
helicopters will supplement the Qatar Emiri
Air Force’s previous procurement of twenty-
four (24) AH–64Es, which are capable of meet-
ing its requirements for close air support,
armed reconnaissance, and anti-tank warfare
missions. The helicopters will provide a
long-term defensive and offensive capability
to the Qatar peninsula as well as enhance
the protection of key oil and gas infrastruc-
ture and platforms. Qatar will have no dif-
ficulty absorbing these helicopters into its
armed forces.
The proposed sale of this equipment and
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.
The prime contractors will be The Boeing
Company, Mesa, Arizona; Lockheed Martin
Corporation, Orlando, Florida; General Elec-
tric, Cincinnati, Ohio; Lockheed Martin Mis-
sion Systems and Sensors, Owego, New York;
Longbow Limited Liability Corporation, Or-
lando, Florida; Thales Corporation, Paris,
France; and Raytheon Corporation. There
are no known offset agreements proposed in
connection with this potential sale.
Implementation of this proposed sale will
require the assignment of three (3) U.S. Gov-
ernment and five (5) contractor representa-
tives to Qatar to support delivery of the
Apache helicopters and provide support and
equipment familiarization. In addition,
Qatar has expressed an interest in expanding
their planned Technical Assistance Fielding
Team for additional in-country pilot and
maintenance training to support this addi-
tional quantity of aircraft. To support the
requirement a team of twenty (20) personnel
(up to three military team members and 17
contractors) would be deployed to Qatar for
approximately three years.
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed
sale.

Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the
Arms Export Control Act
Annex Item No. vii
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology:
1. The AH–64E Apache Attack Helicopter
weapon system contains communications
and target identification equipment, naviga-
tion equipment, aircraft survivability equip-
ment, displays, and sensors. The airframe
itself does not contain sensitive technology;
however, the equipment listed below will be
either installed on the aircraft or included in
the sale and carries technology transfer sig-
nificance. The highest level of information
that could be disclosed through the sale of
the Apache in the configuration proposed for
sale to Qatar is SECRET.
2. The AN/APG–78 Fire Control Radar
(FCR) is an active, low probability of inter-
cept, millimeter-wave radar, combined with
the AN/APR–48, a passive Radar Frequency
Interferometer (RFI) mounted on top of the
helicopter mast. The FCR Targeting Mode
detects, locates, classifies and prioritizes
stationary or moving armored vehicles,
tanks and mobile air defense systems as well
as hovering and moving helicopters and fixed
wing aircraft in normal flight. The highest
level of information associated with the FCR
and RFI is classified SECRET.
3. The AN/ASQ–170, Modernized Target Ac-
quisition and Designation Sight (AN/AAQ–
11), Modernized Pilot Night Vision Sensor
(M–TADS/M–PNVS) is an enhanced version
of its predecessor. It provides second genera-
tion day, night, and limited adverse weather
target information, as well as night naviga-
tion capabilities. The M-PNVS provides sec-
ond generation thermal imaging that per-
mits safer nap-of-the-earth flight to, from,
and within the battle area. The M–TADS
provides the co-pilot gunner with improved
search, deletion, recognition, and designa-
tion by means of Direct View Optics (DVO),
television, and second generation Forward
Looking Infrared (FLIR) sighting systems
that may be used singularly or in combina-
tions. M–TAD/M–PNVS hardware is UN-
CLASSIFIED. The technical manuals for au-
thorized maintenance levels are UNCLASSI-
FIED. Specific information related to effec-
tive system performance parameters (e.g.
range, accuracy, etc.) is classified CON-
FIDENTIAL.
4. The AN/AAR–57(V)7, Common Missile
Warning System detects threat missiles in
flight, evaluates potential false alarms, de-
clares validity of threat, and selects appro-
priate Infrared Countermeasures (IRCM). It
includes Electro Optical Missile Sensors,
Electronic Control Unit (ECU), Sequencer,
and the Improved Countermeasures Dis-
penser (ICMD) that consists of the Dispenser
Assembly and the Payload Module. The
ICMD dispenses decoy expendable objects
(chaff, flares, etc.) to confuse threat radar
devices. In-country repair capability will not
be provided. Reverse engineering is not a
major concern. The hardware is UNCLASSI-
FIED when the software is not loaded. The
software is classified SECRET.
5. The AN/APR–39, Radar Signal Detecting
Set is designed to operate on rotary wing
and slow moving fixed wing aircraft to de-
tect, categorize, and prioritize pulse radio
frequency emitter illuminating the host
platform to allow appropriate counter-
measures. This is the 1553 data bus compat-
ible configuration. In-country repair capa-
bility will not be provided. Hardware is UN-
CLASSIFIED when the software is not load-
ed. The software is CONFIDENTIAL. The
system can be programmed with threat data
provided by the purchasing country.
6. The AN/AVR–2B Laser Detecting Set is a
passive laser warning system that receives
processes, and displays threat information
resulting from aircraft illumination by laser
designators, rangefinders, and beamrider
missile guidance systems. The AN/AVR–2B
uses the existing AN/APR–39A/D interface for
control status and crew warning. The threat
information is processed by the AN/APR–39
RSDS, displayed on the aircraft multi-func-
tion display and announced by the AN/APR–
39 RSDS via the aircraft Inter Communica-
tion System. In-country repair capability
will not be provided. Reverse engineering is
not a major concern. The hardware is classi-
fied CONFIDENTIAL; releasable technical
manuals for operation and maintenance are
classified SECRET.
7. Embedded Global Positioning System
(GPS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS).
GPS/INS utilize GPS satellite signals to cor-
rect or calibrate a solution from an INS. In-
ertial navigation systems usually can pro-
vide an accurate solution only for short du-
ration. The INS accelerometers produce an
unknown bias signal that appears as a gen-
uine specific force. The EGI is Selective
Available Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM)
based on navigation platform that combines
an inertia sensor for position information
and is UNCLASSIFIED. The GPS crypto
variables need the highest GPS accuracy and

COMPACT OF FREE ASSOCIATION
VETERANS REVIEW ACT
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, due to a
clerical error, the senior Senator from
Alaska, Ms. MURKOWSKI, was not added
as an original cosponsor and co-lead of
the Compact of Free Association Vet-
erans Review Act when we introduced
the bill together on April 29, 2019. Sen-
ator MURKOWSKI has been a tireless ad-
vocate of veterans from the Compact
States and a strong partner in our ef-
fort to expand Department of Veterans
Affairs care to those veterans still liv-
ing in the Federated States of Micro-
nesia, the Republic of the Marshall Is-
lands, and Republic of Palau. I thank
her for her partnership to fulfill our
commitment to provide veterans ev-
erywhere with the access to high-qual-
ity care they have earned and deserve.
Thank you.

TRIBUTE TO MICHIGAN’S
VETERANS
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President,
today I wish to pay special tribute to
Michigan residents who have given
their lives while serving in our Na-
tion’s Armed Forces and their families.
As long as Michigan has been a
State—and even before—our people
have been willing to put their lives on
the line in defense of this Nation. From
the War of 1812, to the Civil War, the
World Wars, Korea, Vietnam, the Cold
War, and the fight against terrorism,
the people of Michigan have raised
their hand when called upon and stood
to the very end.
That was never more true than on
December 7, 1941.
That morning, 2,341 American
servicemembers lost their lives when
Pearl Harbor was attacked. More than
30 of those who died were from Michi-
gan.
This spring, I had the opportunity to
honor their sacrifice in person when I
visited Pearl Harbor with Senate col-
leagues.
It is difficult to explain just how
moving it is to see Battleship Row and
to gaze down at the USS Arizona, so
quiet and still in those clear blue
waters. I thought about what it must
have been like that Sunday morning, a
day that began like any other, but
which would live in infamy.
Imagine being barely out of high
school, far from home, and on the,
threshold of war. Imagine being aboard
a ship that is coming under attack.
Imagine the fearful realization that
this might be where your story ends.
These veterans gave everything for
us. It is our solemn duty to keep the
promises we have made to them.
My own father served in the Navy
during World War II. Being there at
Pearl Harbor reminded me of his sac-
rifice and the sacrifices made by all of
our veterans, especially those we have
lost. On Memorial Day and every day,
let’s give them our heartfelt thanks,
surround their families with love, and
honor their sacrifice.
Thank you.

REMEMBERING JACQUELINE L.
FALK
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I
wish to honor Jacqueline ‘‘Jackie’’
Louise Falk. Jackie was an incredible
force in Democratic politics for dec-
ades. She left behind a tightknit fam-
ily of relatives and a political family
that stretches around the world.
Jackie is best known for holding a
key role in nearly every Democratic
National Convention from 1972 through
2004. She also was on staff at the Demo-
cratic National Committee (DNC), as
an aide to then-treasurer Robert
Strauss, during the time of the Water-
gate break-in; she served as assistant
to the counselor to the President dur-
ing the Carter Administration; and
served as administrative assistant and
chief of staff to U.S. Representative
Leo Zeferetti in the early 1980s.
Jackie suffered a stroke last week
and passed away on Wednesday, May 8,
surrounded by her loving, extended
family. Jackie never sought the spot-
light. but left her mark on our party
and our country by bringing a sem-
blance of order to the sometimes-cha-
otic world of nominating the President
of the United States.
Today, I would like to honor Jackie’s
memory by sharing some of her re-
markable story. To tell the story of
Jackie Falk is more than politics, al-
though it is weaved throughout her
life. As one friend, Yolanda Caraway,
described her: ‘‘Jackie was one of the
sweetest, kindest and funniest people
I’ve ever known and I’m really going to
miss her, especially her wonderful
laugh.’’
Jackie was born in Trenton, NJ, to
Minnie and Arlo Falk. She grew up
with her brother Albert and sister Lisa.
Jackie got hooked on politics and pub-
lic service at a young age thanks to her
Aunt Violet (Williams Biglane), who,
after service in the Navy WAVES, went
on to work as the personal secretary to
former Senator and former Vice Presi-
dent Hubert Humphrey.
Jackie would tell stories of inter-
acting with Hubert Humphrey and
passing out flyers for his campaign. In
1964, Jackie accompanied Aunt Violet
to the Democratic National Convention
in Atlantic City, NJ, to see Humphrey
nominated as Vice President. Aunt
Violet helped Jackie make her way to
the Democratic National Committee,
where she started working in 1972 for
then-DNC Treasurer Robert Strauss.
Jackie went on to work closely with
every Democratic Party chairman from
Strauss through Terry McAuliffe.
When Terry McAuliffe, former Gov-
ernor of Virginia and former chairman
of the DNC, heard of Jackie’s death, he
had this to say: ‘‘We lost a legend. The
Democratic Party and Democratic Na-
tional Conventions will never be the
same. Jackie’s convention
credentialing was a labor of love and
truly a work of art. She conducted her
credential operation like Mozart con-
ducted his symphonies. She never
ceased to amaze. I and so many others
will forever be in her debt and will miss
her deeply.’’
In 1975, Jackie moved to Atlanta to
work on the Presidential campaign of
Jimmy Carter. She returned to Wash-
ington to work on his White House
staff in the Office of the Counselor to
the President. The Washington region
would remain her home, even as she
would take up temporary residence
every 4 years in whatever city was the
latest to host the Democratic nomi-
nating convention. Oftentimes, she was
one of the first people working on a
convention and one of the last to wrap
things up.
After President Carter lost relection,
Jackie worked on Capitol Hill, where
she served as chief of staff, administra-
tive assistant, to Congressman Leo
Zeferetti from January 1981 to January
1983. She then was hired early for the
Democratic Convention in San Fran-
cisco, which was the start of her run
overseeing credentials and a larger
swath of the conventions.
From 1984 on, she was responsible for
credentials—who gets the precious ac-
cess passes and where they could go—

either as credentials director or as dep-
uty convention manager. This made
her one of the most sought after and
powerful women in Democratic poli-
tics.
In the 1990s, between conventions and
DNC work, Jackie started an interior
decorating business. Clients came from
among her political contacts, including
Mary Matalin and James Carville.
Jackie loved her family; she cheered
on their milestones and loved cele-
brating holidays together. She is sur-
vived by her brother and sister-in-law
Albert and Debbie Enourato; sister
Lisa Enourato; nieces Whitney and
Hannah McNees; nephews Will, Luke,
and Eli McNees and Wyatt and Gunnar
Enourato. Her great love also was for
her Great Pyrenees; the latest was
Bree, who we know misses her dearly.
Jackie also built an immensely loyal
political family that came together
every 4 years for conventions and as
often as possible for happy hour or din-
ner at Jackie’s house. She was an in-
credible mentor and role model. She
demonstrated how a woman in politics
could be both strong and gentle, funny
and serious.
Let me close by saying that May is
National Stroke Awareness Month. Ev-
eryone is encouraged to know the signs
and understand how important it is to
get help quickly. The minutes and
hours right after stroke occurs are cru-
cial. According to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control—CDC—stroke, while pre-
ventable, is the fifth leading cause of
death in the United States and a lead-
ing cause of severe disability. Jackie
Falk died of a stroke, and the CDC says
that approximately 60 percent of indi-
viduals who die from strokes are
women. I urge the women and the men
out there not to ignore the signs, such
as sudden numbness, confusion, trouble
seeing, trouble walking, and severe
headache.
The political world will never again
see someone the likes of Jackie Falk.
Her memory will be a blessing to her
family, all those who knew her, and all
those who benefited from her hard
work, dedication, and love of the
Democratic Party and the good it can
accomplish.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO LARRY GAMMON
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, today I
would like to recognize the retirement
of Mr. Larry Gammon of Bedford, NH,
after 47 years of service to Easterseals.
Larry started his career with
Easterseals New Hampshire in 1971,
serving as the facilities director and
helping out with everything from
teaching to driving the bus.
In 1985, Larry was named president
and CEO of Easterseals New Hamp-
shire, Vermont, and Maine and, for the
past 33 years, has overseen the pro-
grams and services offered to individ-
uals who experience disabilities in

ily services, early supports and serv-
ices, autism services, residential and

RECOGNIZING PEET SHOE DRYER,
INC.
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a mem-
ber and former chairman of the Senate
Committee on Small Business and En-
trepreneurship, it is my privilege to
recognize an Idaho small business that
exemplifies creativity, hard work, and
dedication to improving their commu-
nity. The small business I am honoring
today is a shining example of the many
Idaho businesses that are led by inno-
vative individuals who are not afraid to
harness creativity to bring new and in-
ventive ideas to market. In honor of
the U.S. Small Business Administra-
tion’s National Small Business Week,
it is my pleasure to name PEET Shoe
Dryer, Inc., of St. Maries, ID, as the
Senate Small Business of the Day.
Founded in 1968 in the heart of one of
the most beautiful locales in the
United States, PEET Shoe Dryer has
been a supporter of American outdoor
enthusiasts for the last 50 years.
Searching for a quicker way to dry his
boots after hiking, founder Gene Peet
designed the original shoe dryer for his
own personal use. Soon, however, his
friends and family began requesting
shoe dryers for themselves. Realizing
the demand for his new invention, Gene
opened PEET Shoe Dryer.
Starting from humble beginnings,
Gene and his son Blair began building
their shoe dryers in the kitchen of
their family home. Gene’s first cus-
tomers were loggers and hunters in the
local St. Maries area, who depend on
having dry and comfortable shoes for
their workday. Not having enough
money for advertising, Gene simply re-
lied on the quality of his product and
satisfaction of his customers to help
spread the word for his new invention;
and as word spread, Gene’s enterprise
quickly grew into a thriving business.
Today, PEET Shoe Dryer, now run by
Gene’s son Blair Peet, continues to
succeed. They have improved the man-
ufacturing of their boot and shoe dry-
ers, as well as expanded their offerings.
Serving millions of customers over the
years, PEET Shoe Dryer has never
compromised on its commitment to
quality and service.
Having grown from a small, word-of-
mouth business to a successful inter-
national exporter, PEET Shoe Dryer is
an outstanding example of the Amer-
ican dream. It is with great pleasure
that I extend my congratulations to
the Peet family and all of the employ-
ees at PEET Shoe Dryer, Incorporated,
for being named the Senate Small
Business of the Day. I wish them well
as they continue serving the people of
Idaho and look forward to watching
their continued growth and success.∑

As a student at Seminole Elementary
School in the 1990’s, Jade participated
in a weekly culture class on the Brigh-
ton Reservation to learn about Semi-
nole history. This was her favorite
class and served as an inspiration for
her continued learning of Native Amer-
ican affairs.
Like her students, Jade is a second
language learner of Creek. She believes
teaching the language to her students
is very important, as there are only 33
speakers of the language left in the re-
gion. She is dedicated to doing every-
thing she can to keep the language
alive for future generations.
Jade teaches Creek 1 and 2 at
Pemayetv Emahakv Charter School to
seventh and eighth grade students. She
graduated from Edison College in 2004
and was offered a job teaching Semi-
nole history. The weekly program
helped the creation of the charter
school in 2007, where Jade taught Semi-
nole history until 2015.

they are accepted, heard, and sup-
ported while in school. Justin memo-
rizes the names of each student prior
to their first day of class to ensure
they know they matter to him.
Justin is an Advanced Placement cal-
culus teacher at Jensen Beach High
School and has taught for 16 years, the
last in the Martin County School Dis-
trict. He also works as a student men-
tor at Indian River State College’s
Take Stock in Children scholarship
program, assists students with SAT
and ACT test preparation, and served
as a sponsor for his school’s math
honor society.
I would like to thank Justin for the
good work he has done for his students
over the years. I wish all the best to
him, and look forward to learning of
his continued success in coming years.∑

TRIBUTE TO SHANE SWEZEY
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I
recognize Shane Swezey, the Sarasota
County Teacher of the Year from Oak
Park School in Sarasota, FL.
Shane received this award at the
Education Foundation of Sarasota
County’s Ignite Education Awards
Celebration in front of a crowd of more
than 300 people. Shane provides music
education and therapy services to stu-
dents at Oak Park School, the dis-
trict’s center school for special needs.
He is a staunch advocate for students
with special needs, preferring to focus
on the abilities of his students, rather
than dwell on their disabilities. He
views music as an engaging, moti-
vating, and accessible medium to sup-
port his students’ academic goals.
Shane’s colleagues note he uses cre-
ative teaching methods to engage his
students and build trust with them. He
plays songs and sings with his students
to cue certain words from them. When
a student says the word in question, his
attempt is successful, and this is part
of what makes his job so worthwhile to
him.
I extend my sincere thanks and ap-
preciation to Shane for his tireless
work to help teach his students. I look
forward to hearing of his continued
good work in the years to come.∑

TRIBUTE TO JESSICA WOOD
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I
recognize Jessica Wood, the Monroe
County Teacher of the Year from Key
West High School in Key West, FL.
Jessica teaches Advanced Placement
biology and biology and is the science
department chair. Her work has an im-
pact on the entire school as she leads
the school’s recycling club efforts and
serves as a sponsor for Keys to Be the
Change, a school club focused on devel-
oping student character through serv-
ice.
Jessica also works with members of
outside agencies to read to younger
students and promote substance abuse
prevention outreach throughout the
community. The main thing that in-
spires Jessica as an educator is the
ability to effect positive change on her
students by serving as a role model and
to continue learning herself.
Jessica is active in her field, working
on her pedagogy and assisting others.
She has held numerous professional de-
velopment trainings at her school and
throughout the school district. She has
been a part of the STEM fair and is
also a member of the building level
planning team.
I extend my best wishes to Jessica
for her work as a teacher and look for-
ward to learning of her continued suc-
cess in the years to come.∑

TRIBUTE TO ROBERT A.
ALTENKIRCH
∑ Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I
wish to commend Dr. Robert
Altenkirch for his leadership at the
University of Alabama in Huntsville.
Dr. Altenkirch led the university as
president from 2011 to 2019. While serv-
ing in this capacity, he implemented
many strategic growth initiatives and
promoted economic development
throughout the campus and the city of
Huntsville, AL.
Under Dr. Altenkirch’s leadership,
UAH provided assistance in recruiting
numerous corporations to north Ala-
bama. Those corporations include Blue
Origin, Aerojet, Rocketdyne, GE Avia-
tion, and Polaris. He also spearheaded
the purchase of a 58-acre business park
that is adjacent to the campus and
serves as a town center for the students
and faculty.
Continuing to add to his legacy, Dr.
Altenkirch established the D.S. David-
son Invention to Innovation business
incubator. This regional initiative fos-
ters, promotes, and accelerates the
commercialization of technology-based
ventures through incubation, co-work-
ing, mentorship, funding, and strategic
support.
Not only did Dr. Altenkirch expand
the university physically and economi-
cally, but he also contributed to the
university’s growth in total enrollment
over the past 5 years. By the fall of
2019, the enrollment at UAH sky-
rocketed by more than 10,000 students.
The average ACT score for incoming
freshman reached an alltime record
high at the university under Dr.
Altenkirch. By fall 2018, the average
score was 28.5, which is the highest
among the State of Alabama’s public
universities.
Studying mechanical engineering,
Dr. Altenkirch earned a B.S. from Pur-
due University, an M.S. from the Uni-
versity of California, Berkley, and a
Ph.D. from Purdue. He was recognized
as one of the 101 Most Influential Peo-
ple in the State of New Jersey in 2009,
as Dr. Altenkirch served as the presi-
dent of New Jersey Institute of Tech-
nology for 9 years prior to his tenure at
UAH.
Dr. Altenkirch deserves the highest
recognition for his outstanding leader-
ship at the University of Alabama in

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE
REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION
OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY
WITH RESPECT TO YEMEN THAT
WAS ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN
EXECUTIVE ORDER 13611 OF MAY
16, 2012—PM 16
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message
from the President of the United
States, together with an accompanying
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Banking, Housing, and
Urban Affairs:
To the Congress of the United States:
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90
days before the anniversary date of its
declaration, the President publishes in
the Federal Register and transmits to
the Congress a notice stating that the
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to
the Federal Register for publication the
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive
Order 13611 of May 16, 2012, with respect
to Yemen is to continue in effect be-
yond May 16, 2019.
The actions and policies of certain
former members of the Government of
Yemen and others continue to threaten
Yemen’s peace, security, and stability,
including by obstructing the political
process in Yemen and the implementa-
tion of the agreement of November 23,
2011, between the Government of
Yemen and those in opposition to it,
which provided for a peaceful transi-
tion of power that meets the legitimate
demands and aspirations of the Yemeni
people. For this reason, I have deter-
mined that it is necessary to continue
the national emergency declared in Ex-
ecutive Order 13611 with respect to
Yemen.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS
By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Ms.
CANTWELL, Mr. CARDIN, Mr.
WHITEHOUSE, Mr. BROWN, and
Ms. HASSAN):
S. 1428. A bill to amend the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 to permit treat-
ment of student loan payments as elec-
tive deferrals for purposes of employer
matching contributions, and for other
purposes; to the Committee on Fi-
nance.
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I
have introduced the Retirement Parity
for Student Loans Act. This legislation
would permit employers to make
matching contributions to workers
under 401(k) and similar types of retire-
ment plans as if worker student loan
payments were salary reduction con-
tributions to the retirement plan. This
legislation will help workers who can-
not afford to both save for retirement
and pay off their student loan debt by
providing them with employer con-
tributions to build their retirement
savings. This legislation is a common
sense fix to our nation’s laws that gov-
ern employer-sponsored retirement
plans and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation.
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the text of the bill be printed
in the RECORD.
There being no objection, the text of
the bill was ordered to be printed in
the RECORD, as follows:
S. 1428
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Retirement

MENTS AS ELECTIVE DEFERRALS

TRIBUTIONS.

tion 401(m)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986 is amended by striking ‘‘and’’ at the
end of clause (i), by striking the period at
the end of clause (ii) and inserting ‘‘, and’’,
and by adding at the end the following new
clause:
‘‘(iii) subject to the requirements of para-
graph (13), any employer contribution made
to a defined contribution plan on behalf of an
employee on account of a qualified student
loan payment.’’.
(b) QUALIFIED STUDENT LOAN PAYMENT.—
Paragraph (4) of section 401(m) of the Inter-
nal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by add-
ing at the end the following new subpara-
graph:
‘‘(D) QUALIFIED STUDENT LOAN PAYMENT.—
The term ‘qualified student loan payment’
means a payment made by an employee in
repayment of a qualified education loan (as
defined in section 221(d)(1)) incurred to pay
qualified higher education expenses of the
employee, but only—
‘‘(i) to the extent such payments in the ag-
gregate for the year do not exceed an
amount equal to—
‘‘(I) the limitation applicable under section
402(g) for the year (or, if lesser, the employ-
ee’s compensation (as defined in section
415(c)(3)) for the year), reduced by
‘‘(II) the elective deferrals made by the em-
ployee for such year, and
‘‘(ii) if the employee certifies to the em-
ployer making the matching contribution
under this paragraph that such payment has
been made on such loan.
For purposes of this subparagraph, the term
‘qualified higher education expenses’ means
the cost of attendance (as defined in section
472 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as in
effect on the day before the date of the en-
actment of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997)
at an eligible educational institution (as de-
fined in section 221(d)(2)).’’.

FIED STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS.—Subsection
(m) of section 401 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 is amended by redesignating
paragraph (13) as paragraph (14), and by in-
serting after paragraph (12) the following
new paragraph:
‘‘(13) MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS FOR QUALI-
FIED STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS.—
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of para-
graph (4)(A)(iii), an employer contribution
made to a defined contribution plan on ac-
count of a qualified student loan payment
shall be treated as a matching contribution
for purposes of this title if—
‘‘(i) the plan provides matching contribu-
tions on account of elective deferrals at the
same rate as contributions on account of
qualified student loan payments,
‘‘(ii) the plan provides matching contribu-
tions on account of qualified student loan
payments only on behalf of employees other-
wise eligible to make elective deferrals, and
‘‘(iii) under the plan, all employees eligible
to receive matching contributions on ac-
count of elective deferrals are eligible to re-
ceive matching contributions on account of
qualified student loan payments.
‘‘(B) TREATMENT FOR PURPOSES OF NON-
DISCRIMINATION RULES, ETC.—
‘‘(i) NONDISCRIMINATION RULES.—For pur-
poses of subparagraph (A)(iii), subsection
(a)(4), and section 410(b), matching contribu-
tions described in paragraph (4)(A)(iii) shall
not fail to be treated as available to an em-
ployee solely because such employee does
not have debt incurred under a qualified edu-
cation loan (as defined in section 221(d)(1)).
‘‘(ii) STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS NOT TREATED
AS PLAN CONTRIBUTION.—Except as provided
in clause (iii), a qualified student loan pay-
ment shall not be treated as a contribution
to a plan under this title.
‘‘(iii) MATCHING CONTRIBUTION RULES.—
Solely for purposes of meeting the require-
ments of paragraph (11)(B) or (12) of this sub-
section, or paragraph (11)(B)(i)(II), (12)(B), or
(13)(D) of subsection (k), a plan may treat a
qualified student loan payment as an elec-
tive deferral or an elective contribution,
whichever is applicable.’’.
(d) SIMPLE RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS.—Para-
graph (2) of section 408(p) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding
at the end the following new subparagraph:
‘‘(F) MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS FOR QUALI-
FIED STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS.—
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—Subject to the rules of
clause (iii), an arrangement shall not fail to
be treated as meeting the requirements of
subparagraph (A)(iii) solely because under
the arrangement, solely for purposes of such
subparagraph, qualified student loan pay-
ments are treated as amounts elected by the
employee under subparagraph (A)(i)(I) to the
extent such payments do not exceed—
‘‘(I) the applicable dollar amount under
subparagraph (E) (after application of sec-
tion 414(v)) for the year (or, if lesser, the em-
ployee’s compensation (as defined in section
415(c)(3)) for the year), reduced by
‘‘(II) any other amounts elected by the em-
ployee under subparagraph (A)(i)(I) for the
year.
‘‘(ii) QUALIFIED STUDENT LOAN PAYMENT.—
For purposes of this subparagraph—
‘‘(I) IN GENERAL.—The term ‘qualified stu-
dent loan payment’ means a payment made
by an employee in repayment of a qualified
education loan (as defined in section
221(d)(1)) incurred to pay qualified higher
education expenses of the employee, but only
if the employee certifies to the employer
making the matching contribution that such
payment has been made on such a loan.
‘‘(II) QUALIFIED HIGHER EDUCATION EX-
PENSES.—The term ‘qualified higher edu-
cation expenses’ has the same meaning as
when used in section 401(m)(4)(D).
‘‘(iii) APPLICABLE RULES.—Clause (i) shall
apply to an arrangement only if, under the
arrangement—
‘‘(I) matching contributions on account of
qualified student loan payments are provided
only on behalf of employees otherwise eligi-
ble to elect contributions under subpara-
graph (A)(i)(I), and
‘‘(II) all employees otherwise eligible to
participate in the arrangement are eligible
to receive matching contributions on ac-
count of qualified student loan payments.’’.
(e) 403(b) PLANS.—Subparagraph (A) of sec-
tion 403(b)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the
following: ‘‘The fact that the employer offers
matching contributions on account of quali-
fied student loan payments as described in
section 401(m)(13) shall not be taken into ac-
count in determining whether the arrange-
ment satisfies the requirements of clause (ii)
(and any regulation thereunder).’’.
(f) 457(B) PLANS.—Subsection (b) of section
457 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is
amended by adding at the end the following:
‘‘A plan which is established and maintained
by an employer which is described in sub-
section (e)(1)(A) shall not be treated as fail-
ing to meet the requirements of this sub-
section solely because the plan, or another
plan maintained by the employer which
meets the requirements of section 401(a),
provides for matching contributions on ac-
count of qualified student loan payments as
described in section 401(m)(13).’’.
(g) REGULATORY AUTHORITY.—The Sec-
retary shall prescribe regulations for pur-
poses of implementing the amendments

ments, as defined in sections 401(m)(4)(D) and

payments under the plan, including an an-
nual deadline (not earlier than 3 months

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask

S. 1437
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Drug-price
Transparency in Communications (DTC)
Act’’.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) Direct-to-consumer advertising of pre-
scription pharmaceuticals is legally per-
mitted in only 2 developed countries, the
United States and New Zealand.
(2) In 2018, pharmaceutical ad spending ex-
ceeded $6,046,000,000, a 4.8-percent increase
over 2017, resulting in the average American
seeing 9 drug advertisements per day.
(3) In 2015, pharmaceutical companies
spent more than $100,000,000 on advertising
with respect to each of the 16 most adver-
tised brand-name drugs and biological prod-
ucts, primarily new and relatively high-cost
medications.
(4) The 10 most commonly advertised drugs
have list prices ranging from $535 to $11,000
per 30-day supply or usual course of therapy.
(5) According to a 2011 Congressional Budg-
et Office report, direct-to-consumer adver-
tising is used to promote only a small set of
specific drugs, typically the expensive,
brand-name medications. And the top-selling
drugs in any given year are frequently
among the drugs with the largest expendi-
tures for direct-to-consumer advertising.
(6) According to a 2011 Congressional Budg-
et Office report, pharmaceutical manufactur-
ers advertise their products directly to con-
sumers in an attempt to boost demand for
their products and thereby raise the price
that consumers are willing to pay, increase
the quantity of drugs sold, or achieve some
combination of the two.
(7) Studies show that patients are more
likely to ask their doctor for a specific medi-
cation and for the doctor to write a prescrip-
tion for it, if a patient has seen an advertise-
ment for such medication, regardless of
whether the medication is clinically appro-
priate for the patient or whether a lower-
cost generic may be available.
(8) According to a 2011 Congressional Budg-
et Office report, the average number of pre-
scriptions written for newly approved brand-
name drugs with direct-to-consumer adver-
tising was 9 times greater than the average
number of prescriptions written for newly
approved brand-name drugs without direct-
to-consumer advertising.
(9) Approximately half of Americans have
high-deductible health plans, under which
they often pay the list price of a drug until
their insurance deductible is met. All of the
top Medicare prescription drug plans use co-
insurance rather than fixed-dollar copay-
ments for medications on nonpreferred drug
tiers.
(10) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services is the single largest drug payer in
the Nation. Drug price inflation accounts for
a significant portion of the 22-percent, 32-
percent, and 42-percent growth in Medicare
parts D and B and Medicaid expenditures, re-
spectively, on a per beneficiary basis be-
tween 2013 and 2016.
(11) The 20 most advertised drugs on tele-
vision cost Medicare and Medicaid a com-
bined $24,000,000,000 in 2017.
(12) Price shopping is the mark of rational
economic behavior, and markets operate
more efficiently when consumers have rel-
evant information about a product, including
its price, before making an informed decision
about whether to buy that product.
(13) The American Medical Association has
passed resolutions supporting the require-
ment for price transparency in any direct-to-
consumer advertising.
(14) The Kaiser Family Foundation found
that 88 percent of the public favors the Fed-
eral Government requiring prescription drug
advertisements to include a statement on
how much the drug costs.
(15) Pursuant to its existing authority
under sections 1102 and 1871 of the Social Se-
curity Act, on May 10, 2019, the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services published reg-
ulations (subpart L of part 403 of title 42,
Code of Federal Regulations) to require di-
rect-to-consumer television advertisements
of prescription drugs and biological products
for which payment is available through or
under Medicare or Medicaid to include the
wholesale acquisition cost of that drug or bi-
ological product.
(16) To support the permanence and clarity
of this policy, and to facilitate future plan-
ning, Congress finds a benefit to codifying
such regulation.
SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT THAT DIRECT-TO-CON-
SUMER ADVERTISEMENTS FOR PRE-
SCRIPTION DRUGS AND BIOLOGICAL
PRODUCTS INCLUDE TRUTHFUL
AND NON-MISLEADING PRICING IN-
FORMATION.
Part A of title XI of the Social Security
Act is amended by adding at the end the fol-
lowing new section:
‘‘REQUIREMENT THAT DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER AD-
VERTISEMENTS FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND
BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS INCLUDE TRUTHFUL
AND NON-MISLEADING PRICING INFORMATION
‘‘SEC. 1150C. (a) IN GENERAL..—The Sec-
retary shall require that each direct-to-con-
sumer advertisement for a prescription drug
or biological product for which payment is
available under title XVIII or XIX includes
an appropriate disclosure of truthful and
non-misleading pricing information with re-
spect to the drug or product.
‘‘(b) DETERMINATION BY CMS.—The Sec-
retary, acting through the Administrator of
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Serv-
ices, shall determine the components of the
requirement under subsection (a), such as
the forms of advertising, the manner of dis-
closure, the price point listing, and the price

Mr. ROBERTS (for himself and Mr.

lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary:
S. RES. 201
Whereas in 1950, 9-year-old Linda Brown,
the daughter of Oliver L. Brown, was denied
entry into the all-white Sumner Elementary
School in Topeka, Kansas, and forced to at-
tend the all-black Monroe Elementary
School in Topeka, Kansas;
Whereas on February 28, 1951, the com-
plaint in Brown v. Board of Education was
filed with the United States District Court
for the District of Kansas, with Oliver L.
Brown as the lead plaintiff;
Whereas the plaintiffs in Brown v. Board of
Education appealed the ruling of the district
court to the Supreme Court;
Whereas, at the Supreme Court, the case of
Brown v. Board of Education was combined
with other cases from South Carolina, Dela-
ware, Virginia, and the District of Columbia
regarding segregation in public schools;
Whereas Thurgood Marshall argued the
case of Brown v. Board of Education before
the Supreme Court as lead counsel for the
appellants;
Whereas on May 17, 1954, the Supreme
Court delivered a unanimous opinion holding
that—
(1) separate educational facilities are in-
herently unequal; and
(2) the ‘‘separate but equal’’ doctrine vio-
lated the 14th Amendment to the Constitu-
tion of the United States, which states that
no citizen may be denied equal protection
under the law;

(1) overruled the 1896 decision in Plessy v.
Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896);
(2) ended discriminatory Jim Crow laws;
and
(3) invalidated the ‘‘separate but equal’’

Kansas and across the United States;
Whereas, in a second opinion issued on
May 31, 1955, the Supreme Court decreed that
schools should be desegregated with all de-
liberate speed;
Whereas, because of the role that Linda
Brown played in ending racial segregation in
the United States, Linda Brown became a
civil rights icon and continued to be a voice
for school desegregation in Topeka, Kansas;
Whereas Linda Brown passed away on
March 27, 2018, at the age of 75 in Topeka,
Kansas; and
Whereas Congress established the Brown v.
Board of Education National Historic Site,
which is located at Monroe Elementary
School in Topeka, Kansas, the school that
Linda Brown attended: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate recognizes and
celebrates—
(1) the 65th anniversary on May 17, 2019, of
the landmark decision of the Supreme Court
in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483

SENATE RESOLUTION 202—CON-
GRATULATING THE STUDENTS,

LEADERS OF CHARTER SCHOOLS
ACROSS THE UNITED STATES
FOR MAKING ONGOING CON-
TRIBUTIONS TO EDUCATION, AND
SUPPORTING THE IDEALS AND
GOALS OF THE 20TH ANNUAL
NATIONAL CHARTER SCHOOLS
WEEK, TO BE HELD ON MAY 12
THROUGH MAY 18, 2019

PERDUE, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. SCOTT of South
Carolina, Mr. TOOMEY, Mr. WICKER, Mr.
YOUNG, Mr. LANKFORD, and Mr. MCCON-
NELL) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed
to:
S. RES. 202
Whereas charter schools are public schools
that do not charge tuition and enroll any
student who wants to attend, often through
a random lottery when the demand for en-
rollment is outmatched by the supply of
available charter school seats;
Whereas high-performing public charter
schools deliver a high-quality public edu-
cation and challenge each student to reach
the student’s potential for academic success;
Whereas public charter schools promote in-
novation and excellence in public education;
Whereas public charter schools throughout
the United States provide millions of fami-
lies with diverse and innovative educational
options for their children;
Whereas high-performing public charter
schools and charter management organiza-
tions are increasing student achievement
and attendance rates at institutions of high-
er education;
Whereas public charter schools are author-
ized by a designated entity and—
(1) respond to the needs of communities,
families, and students in the United States;
and
(2) promote the principles of quality, ac-
countability, choice, high performance, and
innovation;
Whereas, in exchange for flexibility and
autonomy, public charter schools are held
accountable by the authorizers of the char-
ter schools for improving student achieve-
ment and for sound financial and operational
management;
Whereas public charter schools are re-
quired to meet the student achievement ac-
countability requirements under the Ele-
mentary and Secondary Education Act of
1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) in the same man-
ner as traditional public schools;
Whereas public charter schools often set
higher expectations for students, beyond the
requirements of the Elementary and Sec-
ondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301
et seq.), to ensure that the charter schools
are of high quality and truly accountable to
the public;
Whereas 44 States, the District of Colum-
bia, and Puerto Rico have enacted laws au-
thorizing public charter schools;
Whereas, as of the 2017–2018 school year,
more than 7,000 public charter schools served
approximately 3,200,000 children;
Whereas enrollment in public charter
schools grew from approximately 400,000 stu-
dents in 2001 to approximately 3,200,000 stu-
dents in 2019, an eightfold increase in 18
years;
Whereas, in the United States—
(1) in 214 school districts, more than 10 per-
cent of public school students are enrolled in
public charter schools; and
(2) in 21 school districts, more than 30 per-
cent of public school students are enrolled in
public charter schools;
Whereas public charter schools improve
the achievement of students enrolled in the
charter schools and collaborate with tradi-
tional public schools to improve public edu-
cation for all students;
Whereas public charter schools—
(1) give parents the freedom to choose pub-
lic schools;
(2) routinely measure parental satisfaction
levels; and
(3) must prove the ongoing success of the
charter schools to parents, policymakers,
and the communities served by the charter
schools or risk closure;
Whereas a 2015 report from the Center for
Research on Education Outcomes at Stan-
ford University found significant improve-
ments for students at urban charter schools,
and compared to peers of traditional public
schools, each year those students completed
the equivalent of 28 more days of learning in
reading and 40 more days of learning in
math;
Whereas parental demand for charter
schools is high, and there was an estimated
5 percent growth in charter school enroll-
ment between the 2016–2017 and 2017–2018
school years; and
Whereas the 20th annual National Charter
Schools Week is scheduled to be celebrated
the week of May 12 through May 18, 2019:
Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) congratulates the students, families,
teachers, leaders, and staff of public charter
schools across the United States for—
(A) making ongoing contributions to pub-
lic education;
(B) making impressive strides in closing
the academic achievement gap in schools in
the United States, particularly in schools
with some of the most disadvantaged stu-
dents in both rural and urban communities;
and
(C) improving and strengthening the public
school system throughout the United States;
(2) supports the ideals and goals of the 20th
annual National Charter Schools Week, a
week-long celebration to be held May 12
through May 18, 2019, in communities
throughout the United States; and
(3) encourages the people of the United
States to hold appropriate programs, cere-
monies, and activities during National Char-
ter Schools Week to demonstrate support for
public charter schools.

SENATE RESOLUTION 203—RECOG-
NIZING THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY
OF THE AIRCRAFT OWNERS AND
PILOTS ASSOCIATION
Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Ms.
DUCKWORTH, Mr. CRAMER, Mr. MORAN,
Mr. ROBERTS, Mr. WYDEN, Mr. DAINES,
Mr. BOOZMAN, Mr. SULLIVAN, and Mr.
VAN HOLLEN) submitted the following
resolution; which was considered and
agreed to:
S. RES. 203
Whereas on May 15, 2019, the Aircraft Own-
ers and Pilots Association (referred to in this
preamble as ‘‘AOPA’’), will celebrate 80 years
of successfully representing the interests of
general aviation pilots and private aircraft
ownership across the United States;
Whereas AOPA was formed on May 15, 1939,
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the years
leading up to the entry of the United States
into World War II;
Whereas AOPA has grown into the largest
aviation association in the world;
Whereas AOPA has an ongoing legacy of
successfully representing the interests of
general aviation pilots and private aircraft
owners across the United States;
Whereas general aviation plays an impor-
tant role in the economic vitality of commu-
nities across the United States, creating jobs
and opportunities for growth throughout the
United States;
Whereas approximately 5,000 public-use
airports and 15,000 other landing facilities
support the United States general aviation
fleet of nearly 200,000 aircraft and approxi-
mately 600,000 pilots;
Whereas AOPA tirelessly advocates for and
contributes to improving the safety of avia-
tion;
Whereas AOPA is committed to growing
the pilot population by introducing young
people to career opportunities and wel-
coming more women and minorities into
aviation;
Whereas in the 80 years since AOPA was
formed the organization has been led by only
5 presidents: Joseph B. ‘‘Doc’’ Hartranft,
John L. Baker, Philip B. Boyer, Craig L.
Fuller, and Mark R. Baker; and
Whereas AOPA remains committed to pro-
tecting and promoting aviation in the United
States: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate, on the occasion
of the 80th anniversary of the Aircraft Own-
ers and Pilots Association, recognizes the ef-
forts of the association in—
(1) helping to ensure the freedom to fly;
and
(2) leaving a lasting legacy for future gen-
erations of aviators.
