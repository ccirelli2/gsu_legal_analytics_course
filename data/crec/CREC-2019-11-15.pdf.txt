GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION
(Mr. ROUDA asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I rise
today for former Representative Katie
Hill and the people of California’s 25th
District.
Madam Speaker, 261 days ago, Repub-
licans and Democrats came together in
this Chamber to pass meaningful legis-
lation to address our Nation’s gun vio-
lence epidemic.
Madam Speaker, 261 days ago, Mem-
bers representing cities, suburbs, and
rural America did their job and voted
to pass commonsense reforms that 89
percent of Americans support.
Madam Speaker, 261 days ago, Senate
Majority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL
could have done his job and brought
those bills to the floor of the United
States Senate, but he did not; and now,
once again, we watch shooting after
shooting occur across our country.
Yesterday, Saugus High School in
Santa Clarita, California, was added to
the lengthy list of sites of senseless
tragedy.
We fought for the will of the people—
89 percent of Americans. We crafted
legislation that will save lives. We
passed the bill. We did our jobs. It is
time for Senate Majority Leader MITCH
MCCONNELL to do his.
Enough is enough. Children are
dying.
f
RECOGNIZING THE 75TH RANGER
REGIMENT
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the 75th
Ranger Regiment for their role in the
historic elimination of ISIS leader al-
Baghdadi.
On Saturday, October 26, the 75th
Ranger Regiment, along with other
Army Special Forces, flawlessly exe-
cuted an operation that led to the re-
moval of one of the world’s most dan-
gerous terrorists.
This operation is a moment of pride
for all Americans because of the atroc-
ities he and his group have committed
against innocent men, women, and
children. It is an especially proudful
moment for Georgia, in the First Con-
gressional District that I have the
honor and privilege of representing, be-
cause of the reported role of the 75th
Ranger Regiment.
Mr. Speaker, while the 75th Ranger
Regiment is headquartered at Fort
Benning, I am proud to represent one
part of it through the 1st Ranger Bat-
talion, stationed at Savannah’s Hunter
Army Airfield.
I thank all of those in the 75th Rang-
er Regiment for their service to our
Nation and for their bravery.
While details will be restricted, I am
proud of the regiment’s continued role

IN MEMORY OF U.S. ARMY
CAPTAIN ANTOINE LEWIS
(Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I
rise to remember the late U.S. Army
Captain Antoine Lewis of Matteson, Il-
linois, in the Second Congressional Dis-
trict.
I was shocked and saddened to learn
that Captain Lewis was among the 157
people killed in the tragic plane crash
in Ethiopia on March 10. His funeral
was November 9 because his family just
received his remains.
This incredible young man had so
much more to give the world and con-
stantly gave of himself to others. He
possessed an irrepressible curiosity and
a desire to make the world a better
place.
Captain Lewis was a man of pas-
sionate commitment to his family, to
the Matteson community, to our coun-
try, and to his faith. He was a one-man
recruitment team when it came to get-
ting so many in his own family to en-
list. An honorable man, he represented
the very best of America whenever he
served in uniform or wherever he trav-
eled in the world.
Captain Lewis was a patriot who
proudly served his country. He had
been stationed in Afghanistan, South
Korea, and Canada.
He had an adventuresome and free
spirit and was filled with wonder and
curiosity about other people and cul-
tures. While he was raised in Matteson,
he belonged to the world.
He, like many others, went to Africa
to offer hope and opportunity to others
through mission work. As called to do
by St. James, he put his faith into ac-
tions and deeds that uplifted others
and worked to build a better world.
As we grieve with his family and
friends, we are comforted by the
knowledge that he did fulfill his desire
to make the world a better place by the
love he gave to every person and mis-
sion that he encountered.
f
HONORING AMERICA’S DEPARTED
HEROES
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise
today to thank Jeremiah Heesaker and
Theresa Miller of Ely, Minnesota, for
their dedication to our Nation’s vet-
erans.
Last week, in freezing cold tempera-
tures, Jeremiah and Theresa led a
small group of Minnesotans in laying
wreaths decorated with American flags
on top of 130 veteran graves in the Ely
Cemetery. They laid all the wreaths
out before Veterans Day weekend, hop-
ing to bring happiness to all the fami-
lies who would be visiting the grave of
a loved one.
For Jeremiah and Theresa, the care
of our veterans is an issue close to
their hearts. Jeremiah served in the
Army in the 101st Airborne; Theresa’s
husband is also a veteran.
Mr. Speaker, American heroes de-
serve to be treated in death with the
same amount of respect and admira-
tion that they earned in life. I am
grateful to Jeremiah and Theresa for
taking action to honor America’s de-
parted heroes and their families this
Veterans Day.
We must never forget those who have
bravely served so that we can continue
to live in the land of the free.
f
AFFORDABLE PRESCRIPTION
DRUGS FOR AMERICANS
(Mr. KILDEE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, yesterday
was World Diabetes Day.
Diabetes is a disease that affects mil-
lions of Americans, including my own
daughter, Katy, who was diagnosed as a
type 1 diabetic when she was 8 years
old, almost 20 years ago.
We have to do more to make sure
that hardworking families have access
to affordable prescription drugs, often,
lifesaving drugs.
Sadly, under the Trump administra-
tion, the President has rolled back ac-
cess to healthcare and undermined the
Affordable Care Act, raising prices for
lifesaving drugs and eliminating pro-
tections for those with preexisting con-
ditions. That is the aim of this admin-
istration.
One in five Americans are skipping
doses, cutting pills in half, and skip-
ping their insulin because they just
don’t have the money it takes to keep
themselves healthy.
It costs about $5.60 to produce a vial
of insulin. Americans sometimes have
to pay hundreds of dollars just to have
that drug that was brought into this
country, invented in the 1920s, and
hasn’t changed substantially.
We have to make sure to pass H.R. 3,
which will make sure that Americans
have access to prescription drugs at an
affordable price. It is the right thing to
do. Congress has to act.
f
PROVIDING EFFECTIVE COUN-
SELING RESOURCES TO LEARN-
ERS OF ALL AGES
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of
the Counseling for Career Choice Act, a
bill I cosponsored with my fellow Ca-
reer and Technical Caucus co-chair,
Congressman JIM LANGEVIN. The Coun-
seling for Career Choice Act aims to
empower students by providing effec-
tive counseling resources to learners of
all ages.
Unfortunately, many students go to
college without being fully aware of
their education and career opportuni-
ties and options. According to the Coa-
lition of Career Development, about
one-third of high school graduates do
not go to college right away and often
struggle to find meaningful work.
Additionally, a business roundtable
survey found that more than 90 percent
of CEOs agree the skills gap is a sig-
nificant threat to their organizations.
There are approximately 7 million un-
filled jobs in the United States, but
equipping students with the necessary
tools to succeed will help us close this
gap.
With increased counseling opportuni-
ties, students can take control of their
professional futures with confidence.
Whether students choose the tradi-
tional college route or apprenticeships
and trade schools, proper counseling
can make a positive impact in the lives
of students of all ages.
f
STOP EITC AND CTC SEIZURES
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker,
the earned income tax credit and the
child tax credit are some of the most
effective, bipartisan antipoverty pro-
grams to come out of Congress; yet
many hardworking individuals are un-
able to access well-earned EITC or CTC
refunds.
In some cases, the U.S. Treasury has
seized an individual’s tax credits if
they owed student loan debt. These tax
credit seizures, in many cases, have
pushed families into homelessness.
Some have lost their homes; some have
lost their cars; others can’t even put
food on the table for their loved ones.
I am filing a bill this morning that
seeks to protect these most vulnerable
people from EITC and CTC seizures. It
would prohibit the Secretary of the
Treasury from automatically seizing
an individual’s EITC or CTC refund for
the purpose of paying back student
loan debt.
This is the right thing to do. No one
should have to decide between paying
off their student loan debt and pro-
viding for their family.

APPRENTICESHIPS CAN HELP
CLOSE THE SKILLED TRADES GAP
(Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.)
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr.
Speaker, it is National Apprenticeship
Week.
We have 7 million unfilled jobs in
this country, and many of them are in
the skilled trades. We have got to close

that gap, and I think apprenticeships
can help. There are companies like
Midwestern Mechanical in Sioux Falls
who understand that and have created
their own in-house apprenticeship pro-
grams.
Their apprentices get free classes
while they work 40 hours a week in
their field. They earn while they learn.
Unlike many college students, they fin-
ish their program with a license, with
a skill, with a job, and without college
debt.
Now, as we look forward to how do
we grow this economy and how do we
do a better job, we have to understand
that, yes, 4-year degrees are important,
but they are not the only way to close
that skill gap.
I think that in-house apprenticeships
like those at Midwestern Mechanical
show us an important way forward.
f
EXPAND REGISTERED
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS
(Ms. BONAMICI asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, it is
National Apprenticeship Week.
In Oregon and around the country,
registered apprenticeships and pre-ap-
prenticeships are helping people access
good-paying jobs, improving economic
security, and increasing opportunities
for women, people of color, and dis-
located workers.
Last week I met with more than 30
apprentices and union leaders at the
UA 290 Training Center in Tualatin,
Oregon. Their stories are inspiring. I
heard from apprentices like Sade with
Steamfitters Local 290, who said, ‘‘I
love what I do, and people who look
like me coming into these spaces mat-
ters.’’
Jackie, who was once incarcerated, is
now helping others overcome barriers
and enter the workforce. She said
IBEW ‘‘gave me a chance.’’
In discussing the Constructing Hope
Pre-Apprenticeship Training Program,
Sarah, a single mom, said that, with-
out it, ‘‘I would never be here providing
a better life for my kids and myself.’’
During National Apprenticeship
Week, I say to all of my colleagues,
join me. Let’s work together to protect
and expand registered apprenticeship
programs to provide workers with qual-
ity training, portable credentials, high
wages, support services, and a pathway
to a permanent job.
These programs do more than train a
workforce; they change lives for the
better.
f
IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute.)
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, this week
the American people saw the first pub-
lic impeachment hearings in a genera-
tion. These hearings are happening
after weeks of a sham process where
witnesses auditioned, questions were
rehearsed, and testimony was selec-
tively leaked by Democrats as they
tried to craft their narrative.
Unfortunately, despite the start of
public hearings, Democrats are con-
tinuing to audition witnesses, holding
two more secret depositions in a SCIF
this week.
This sham impeachment of President
Trump is continuing despite four unde-
niable facts that the Democrats have
ignored since day one:
One, the transcript of the phone call
shows there was no discussion of condi-
tionality;
Two, both President Trump and
President Zelensky said there was no
pressure;
Three, Ukraine didn’t know the mili-
tary aid was being withheld; and
Four, the aid was ultimately re-
leased, and Ukraine didn’t have to do
anything.
There is no ‘‘there’’ there. It is time
to move on and work on things that
will benefit the American people, like
passing the USMCA, truly bipartisan
prescription drug reform, fully funding
our military, and taking care of our
veterans.
Let’s move past this partisan process
and get to work on the issues that will
benefit every American family.

UNITED STATES EXPORT FINANCE
AGENCY ACT OF 2019
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.
BONAMICI). Pursuant to House Resolu-
tion 695 and rule XVIII, the Chair de-
clares the House in the Committee of
the Whole House on the state of the
Union for the further consideration of
the bill, H.R. 4863.
Will the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.
DANNY K. DAVIS) kindly take the chair.

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
Accordingly, the House resolved
itself into the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union for the
further consideration of the bill (H.R.
4863) to promote the competitiveness of
the United States, to reform and reau-
thorize the United States Export Fi-
nance Agency, and for other purposes,
with Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois
(Acting Chair) in the chair.
The Clerk read the title of the bill.
The Acting CHAIR. When the Com-
mittee of the Whole rose on Thursday,
November 14, 2019, amendment No. 9
printed in House Report 116–289 offered
by the gentleman from California (Mr.
RUIZ) had been disposed of.
AMENDMENT NO. 10 OFFERED BY MS. MENG
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 10 printed
in House Report 116–289.
Ms. MENG. Mr. Chairman, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 7, line 17, insert ‘‘Asian American-
and Native American Pacific Islander-serv-
ing institutions,’’ before ‘‘Tribal colleges’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 695, the gentlewoman
from New York (Ms. MENG) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York.
Ms. MENG. Mr. Chair, my amend-
ment would ensure that the United
States Export Finance Agency’s efforts
to diversify its workforce include out-
reach to Asian American and Native
American Pacific Islander-serving in-
stitutions, AANAPISIs.
AANAPISIs, like other minority-
serving institutions, can provide path-
ways for underserved communities to
earn a degree and secure a job in the
economy.
The underlying bill includes outreach
to historically Black colleges and uni-
versities, Hispanic-serving institutions,
and Tribal colleges and universities.
Whenever there are discussions of mi-
nority communities, it is essential that
we remember to include Asian Ameri-
cans and Pacific Islanders.
For those who are the first in their
family to attend college, minority-
serving institutions can open doors and
fulfill their dreams. If we are to have a
workforce that reflects our diversity,
we must ensure that our government is
reaching into all underserved commu-
nities.
The AAPI community is the fastest-
growing minority group in the U.S. By
2060, the AAPI population is projected
to reach 40 million.
By engaging with minority-serving
institutions like these AANAPISIs, we
can help people achieve their goals,
find fulfilling careers, and ensure our
Nation remains globally competitive.
Again, with my amendment, I am re-
questing that the U.S. Export Finance
Agency is inclusive and engages
AANAPISIs in its workforce outreach
efforts.
Mr. Chair, I urge support for the
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I claim
time in opposition to the amendment,
although I am not opposed.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from North Caro-
lina is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, first, I
want to commend the gentlewoman
from New York (Ms. MENG) for offering
this in the series that she is offering. I
think they are constructive amend-
ments to this reauthorization and im-
portant insights on what we should be
doing to recruit in the Federal work-
force.
And we have a major need, though it
is not in the financial services jurisdic-
tion, but it is really important for all
of us to acknowledge that we have a
need in the Federal workforce for a
wider set of views and expertise coming
into the Federal workforce. I think
this is a thoughtful attempt to do
those things, so I do appreciate the
gentlewoman’s efforts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8886 November 15, 2019
I would say this: The bill encom-
passes historically Black colleges,
women’s colleges, and others, and Ex-
Im will tell you that it doesn’t engage
in a lot of recruitment efforts named in
this legislation, not because it doesn’t
care about diversity, but because it is a
small agency of around 400 staff. But I
think it is important they have this as
a part of their charter.
But let me just say this: This bill and
this reauthorization is unnecessarily
doomed. Chairwoman WATERS and I ne-
gotiated a bipartisan deal, a bill that is
in the Clerk’s office called H.R. 3407,
which would have reauthorized this in-
stitution for a 7-year term, increased
its size, and focused on really impor-
tant things that relate to our national
security and our economic security, in-
cluding combating the rise of Chinese
aggression.
And that bill is still an opportunity
for bipartisanship. What we have before
us today is not. So, while I appreciate
the gentlewoman’s efforts on this
amendment, this bill is not going any-
where in the Senate. The President
said he is going to veto it. Because of
those things, this bill is unnecessarily
doomed.
This reauthorization of the Ex-Im
Bank is unnecessarily put in jeopardy
because of the approach taken here in
the House, and that is unfortunate. I
hope that cooler heads will prevail, and
we will be able to extend and keep the
bank open, the institution open, for a
longer term. I think that will happen
in the appropriations process or in the
continuing resolution, and I would sup-
port those measures.
But the bill before us today Repub-
licans will largely oppose. So, Mr.
Chair, I would encourage my colleagues
to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. MENG. Mr. Chair, I yield back
the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Ms. MENG).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 11 OFFERED BY MS. MENG
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 11 printed
in House Report 116–289.
Ms. MENG. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 8, line 4, after ‘‘internships’’ insert
‘‘(including paid internships)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 695, the gentlewoman
from New York (Ms. MENG) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York.
Ms. MENG. Mr. Chair, my amend-
ment would direct the U.S. Export Fi-
nance Agency to develop and place mi-
norities and women in paid internships.
While the agency has done important
work to expand market opportunities
for American businesses around the
globe, diversity in the workforce is
equally as important.
In today’s economy, internships
often act as the gateway to a profes-
sional career for a recent graduate.
These experiences allow people to
make connections and gain valuable
experiences that prepare them for a
full-time job.
Unpaid internships can be a barrier
to entering a desired career field. While
some young people can take an unpaid
internship, many people lack the re-
sources to do that. This barrier has a
disproportionate impact on minorities,
low-income individuals, and women.
When we do not have adequate diver-
sity in internships and low-level posi-
tions, the pool of diverse individuals
who can grow to serve in leadership po-
sitions in our businesses is severely
stunted.
That is why I introduced this amend-
ment, to highlight the importance of
paid internships. All entities should
focus their efforts on compensating in-
terns for the valuable work they con-
tribute to their workplaces.
Mr. Chair, I urge support for the
amendment, and I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Chair, I claim
time in opposition, although I am not
opposed to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Ohio is recog-
nized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Chair, first, I
want to commend the gentlewoman
from New York for her work on this. I
think it is a great idea to have paid in-
terns at the Ex-Im Bank. The sad part
is it is not going to happen because
this bill is not going to become law.
Republicans agreed unanimously to
support a bipartisan compromise, the
Waters-McHenry bipartisan deal on Ex-
Im Bank, that would have actually re-
authorized the Ex-Im Bank and done it
in a bipartisan way.
Unfortunately, we are here on a par-
tisan process. I have always supported
the Ex-Im Bank. I signed the discharge
petition last time for the Ex-Im Bank,
but I can’t support this product.
Luckily, we have a path forward
through the appropriations process,
and we will be reauthorizing the Ex-Im
Bank on the CR.
I think this general idea is a good
idea, and I hope the gentlewoman will
push it in the version that gets in the
CR because this version, unfortunately,
MITCH MCCONNELL has said is dead in
the Senate and it is under a veto
threat.
So I do encourage my colleagues to
support this amendment, but, unfortu-
nately, it is not going to become law.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.

The Chair recognizes the gentle-

Ms. MENG. Mr. Chair, my amend-
ment would ensure that community
colleges are included in the U.S. Export
Finance Agency’s efforts to diversify
its workforce. We must ensure commu-
nity colleges are not left out of the
broader target of colleges and univer-
sities in the agency’s recruitment ef-
forts.
Approximately 6 million students are
enrolled in public 2-year colleges.
These institutions offer nontraditional
students, like those experiencing finan-
cial obstacles, working parents, or stu-
dents who are embarking on new career
paths, the opportunity to earn a de-
gree.
I am proud to have a community col-
lege, Queensborough Community Col-
lege, in my district in Queens, New
York. I know that community colleges
provide an affordable career pathway
for many students of underserved com-
munities.
That is why I offer this amendment
to ensure that the U.S. Export Finance
Agency engages with community col-
leges across the country in its work-
force outreach efforts.
I urge support for the amendment,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Chair, I claim

to sound like a broken record here, but
Republicans have supported, unani-
mously, a bill that was bipartisan, the
Waters-McHenry deal that would have
reauthorized the Bank. Unfortunately,
we are not here debating that. We have
a much more partisan version in front
of us.
I agree with the gentlewoman from
New York, and I thank her for her
work on a diverse workforce at the Ex-
port-Import Bank. Our community col-
leges do an incredible job. Having sev-
eral community colleges in my dis-
trict, I want to recognize them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8887
November 15, 2019
I encourage my colleagues to support
this amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.
Ms. MENG. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentleman for his words, and I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Chair, I yield back
the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Ms. MENG).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 13 OFFERED BY MS. MENG
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 13 printed
in House Report 116–289.
Ms. MENG. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 10, after line 19, insert the following:
(f) ADDITIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEM-
BERS.—Section 3(d) of such Act (12 U.S.C.
635a(d)) is amended—
(1) in paragraph (1)—
(A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ‘‘17’’
and inserting ‘‘19’’; and
(B) in subparagraph (B), by inserting
‘‘higher education,’’ before ‘‘State’’; and
(2) in paragraph (2), by adding at the end
the following:
‘‘(D) 1 member appointed to the Advisory
Committee shall be representative of 4-year
institutions of higher education.
‘‘(E) 1 member appointed to the Advisory
Committee shall be representative of com-
munity colleges.’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 695, the gentlewoman
from New York (Ms. MENG) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York.
Ms. MENG. Mr. Chair, my amend-
ment adds two advisory positions to
the U.S. Export Finance Agency’s Ad-
visory Committee, one who represents
4-year colleges and one who represents
community colleges.
The Advisory Committee, which cur-
rently is comprised of 17 members, pro-
vides recommendations on agency fi-
nancing programs to strengthen Amer-
ican exports. The committee has rep-
resentatives of environment, produc-
tion, commerce, finance, agriculture,
labor, services, State government, and
textile industries, and the small busi-
ness and labor communities. Adding
two members from the education com-
munity would enhance the committee’s
ability to inform and advise the Export
Finance Agency’s work.
Those who work in our education sys-
tem and with students who study inter-
national trade and finance or go on to
run businesses are uniquely positioned
to provide suggestions on improving
these agency programs. Adding these
instructions would ensure U.S. eco-
nomic competitiveness.
I urge support for the amendment,
and I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Chair, I claim
time in opposition, although I am not
opposed to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Ohio is recog-
nized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Chair, I want to,
again, remind everybody that Repub-
licans unanimously voted for a bipar-
tisan version of Ex-Im authorization,
the Waters-McHenry bipartisan com-
promise. Unfortunately, that deal isn’t
on the floor. We have a version that is
under a veto threat and that the Sen-
ate says is dead on arrival.
While this amendment is great to add
our colleges and community colleges to
the advisory board, it is not going to
become law. Luckily, we do have a
path forward through the appropria-
tions process, and I hope my colleague
from New York will be talking to not
only the Financial Services Committee
staff but the Appropriations Com-
mittee staff to get this in the version
that will become law through the CR.
I encourage my colleagues to support
this amendment. It is too bad it is not
going to become law in this version be-
cause it is dead on arrival in the Sen-
ate and under a veto threat. But I do
hope that the gentlewoman works
through the appropriations process to
make this amendment happen because
our colleges and universities can add a
lot to the advisory board at the Ex-Im.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. MENG. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentleman for his words, and I yield
back the balance of my time.

AMENDMENT NO. 14 OFFERED BY MR. BROWN OF
MARYLAND

in House Report 116–289.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair,
I have an amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 4, after line 15, insert the following:
‘‘(4) TRAINING.—The Agency shall make
available to its employees appropriate inclu-
sion and diversity training, not less fre-
quently than every 2 years, to ensure em-
ployees have an understanding of the specific
challenges facing minority- and women-
owned businesses.’’.

‘‘(5)’’.
Page 5, line 24, strike ‘‘(5)’’ and insert

Page 7, line 7, strike ‘‘(6)’’ and insert ‘‘(7)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 695, the gentleman
from Maryland (Mr. BROWN) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Maryland.
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair,
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.
I want to recognize the hard work of
my colleague from California, Chair-
woman MAXINE WATERS, on the under-
lying bill and the outstanding effort of
the gentlewoman’s entire committee to
bring this bill to the floor.
The Export-Import Bank plays an
important role in helping U.S. busi-
nesses maintain and expand their pres-
ence in the global economy, increasing
exports and creating jobs at no expense
to American taxpayers.
Ninety percent of customers sup-
ported by the Export-Import Bank are
small businesses, not counting the tens
of thousands of companies in the sup-
ply chain of larger exporters.
The Export-Import Bank helps create
a level playing field for American busi-
nesses by countering more than 100 for-
eign export credit agencies. China
alone provides $130 billion in financing
to bolster its exports.
Without Ex-Im, U.S. companies and
workers will be left at a significant dis-
advantage when facing foreign com-
petitors and will struggle to enter com-
petitive markets. This diminishes both
our economic and national security.
The underlying bill reauthorizes the
Bank for 10 years, increases the agen-
cy’s lending capacity to $175 billion,
and gives U.S. companies the tools
they need to have a fair shot in today’s
increasingly competitive trade envi-
ronment.
Mr. Chairman, H.R. 4863 also makes
workforce and supplier diversity a pri-
ority by establishing an Office of Mi-
nority and Women Inclusion at the
agency. A diverse workforce and an in-
clusive workplace have been shown to
enhance financial performance and the
ability to accomplish the mission.
However, there continues to be a trend
of low representation of minorities and
women in the financial services indus-
try and disparities in access to credit,
capital, and banking.
Chairwoman WATERS was one of the
original authors of a section of the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act
that created an Office of Minority and
Women Inclusion at most Federal fi-
nancial service agencies. Now, the new
Export Finance Agency will have such
an office as well. These offices have the
important responsibilities of over-
seeing all diversity matters in manage-
ment, employment, business activities,
and procurement.
My amendment would build on the
existing model by requiring the agency
to offer inclusion and diversity train-
ing to ensure employees understand
the specific challenges facing minority-
and women-owned businesses. This will
allow for the agency to adopt the best
and most up-to-date processes and
practices to ensure we are increasing
contracting opportunities and services
available to minority-owned and
women-owned businesses.
Women- and minority-owned business
exporters is one the fastest growing
market segments, and my amendment
will help more of these firms turn ex-
port opportunities into real sales that
will maintain and create American
jobs.

H8888 November 15, 2019
Now, more than ever, we must work
together to ensure that there are di-
verse perspectives at the table and that
these historically disadvantaged busi-
nesses have the opportunity to grow
and be successful.
I strongly encourage my colleagues
to support this amendment and the un-
derlying bill.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I claim
time in opposition, though I am not op-
posed.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from North Caro-
lina is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, let me
say, to begin with, that, again, Repub-
licans and the Financial Services Com-
mittee unanimously supported the
agreement that Chairwoman WATERS
and I reached on a bipartisan bill that
would strengthen the Bank and combat
Chinese aggression, both their eco-
nomic and military aggression, around
the globe. It forced the Ex-Im Bank to
not subsidize Chinese state-owned en-
terprises that are engaged in especially
the service to the military and intel-
ligence bureaus or the repression of the
people in Hong Kong or religious mi-
norities. That is the focus of it.
Rather than focus on those impor-
tant economic interests for us as
Americans, we are getting into a num-
ber of issues of social policy. That was
the main set of policy changes that we
have before us in this partisan bill that
we are debating, that the Senate ma-
jority leader already says they won’t
take up, and the President already said
he is going to veto.
At the end of the day, we are going to
have a clean reauthorization of the
Bank. It could have been different. We
could have had a different outcome.
I commend Mr. BROWN for offering
the amendment. Look, diversity and
inclusion, we have a subcommittee. It
has been a priority of Chairwoman
WATERS, and we have heard testimony
in that committee from witnesses em-
phasizing the need to change the cor-
porate culture to improve recruitment
and retention of women and minorities,
not for just the social purpose of re-
cruiting more diverse people, but for
the economic outcome that a better
workforce, a more diverse workforce,
both experientially and every type of
measure of diversity, leads to better
economic returns for the shareholders
of those companies.
I think it is really important, what
the gentleman is emphasizing with his
amendment. It has an important social
purpose. It does. But it also has an im-
portant economic outcome. It means
that we get better policies as a result
of better workforce and better inclu-
sion processes for recruiting new folks
and also, once you have folks inter-
nally, how we work with each other.
Quite frankly, the Congress could
use, I think, a little bit of this, a little
bit of the medicine we are giving to
agencies.
Mr. Chair, I support the amendment,
and I yield back the balance of my
time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. BROWN).
The amendment was agreed to.

AMENDMENT NO. 15 OFFERED BY MR. LAMB
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 15 printed
in House Report 116–289.
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 27, line 3, strike ‘‘and’’.
Page 27, line 13, strike the 1st period, the
close quotation marks and the 2nd period
and insert ‘‘; and’’.
Page 27, after line 13, insert the following:
‘‘(3) details the effects of exports and
projects financed by the Agency on the num-
ber of jobs created or retained in the energy
and related technologies industries of the
United States.’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 695, the gentleman
from Pennsylvania (Mr. LAMB) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Pennsylvania.
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Chairman, I thank
Madam Chairwoman for her work on
the underlying bill.
Mr. Chairman, I am offering this
amendment because one of the most
pressing problems in my district in
western Pennsylvania and in America
as a whole has been the massive ero-
sion of our manufacturing and indus-
trial base, particularly in the last 20
years. Many people view this as an
older problem, but, in fact, it is since
the year 2000 that we have shed mil-
lions and millions of jobs, lost mostly
to China and some to Mexico.
But today, in my district, there still
remains a plant that makes large steel
components for nuclear reactors and
nuclear power plants and the Navy’s
nuclear fleet. They are organized by
the IBEW. These are good-paying jobs
in the manufacturing base that have
remained.
And so the question is: How did those
jobs get there, and why did they re-
main? The answer is because the
United States Government has per-
formed its historic role to drive open
and create a new market and preserve
that market with the partnership of
private industry—and that is the mar-
ket for nuclear energy.
If the United States hadn’t made its
investments in the 1940s and 1950s, they
never would have opened the first nu-
clear reactor for civilian use in my dis-
trict in Beaver Valley; we never would
have had 15,000 people working in nu-
clear energy directly in Pennsylvania
today: 71 additional companies and
thousands and thousands of more man-
ufacturing jobs that allow us to sell
nuclear technology all around the
world.
Of the many tools the U.S. Govern-
ment has used for this purpose, the Ex-
port-Import Bank is an important one.
They have helped drive open these new
markets overseas and make it possible
for historic companies like Westing-
house to sell their technology all over
the world, with it still being made and
manufactured in the United States.
And so, today, as we vote to reau-
thorize this Bank, I would ask to add
an amendment that will make sure
that not only will we defend the jobs
we have already created, but we will
play some offense and create some new
jobs. And if we are going to play of-
fense, we will keep score; we will make
sure we know exactly how many jobs
are both preserved and created in the
energy and related manufacturing sec-
tors.
In our district, there is a company
called Eaton that makes software and
hardware products to integrate clean
energy into the grid both in the United
States and overseas. They are one of
the biggest users of Ex-Im financing in
my district. For them to create new
manufacturing jobs to sell new ways to
integrate clean energy all over the
world, they need this reauthorization.
Just earlier this year, I met a Penn-
sylvanian who is working on a design
for wind turbines that look a lot more
like helicopter blades than they do like
the windmills we tend to see today. An
entrepreneur like this will benefit from
the role his government plays in reau-
thorizing the Ex-Im Bank, and we need
to take careful account of every single
new job that is created from new op-
portunities like this one.
Mr. Chair, this is the United States
Government at its finest. We will keep
score on the work we do on the Ex-Im
Bank so that we will win. These jobs
and these markets will be created
somewhere. Our duty is to make sure it
is here.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I
claim the time in opposition to the
amendment, even though I am not op-
posed to it.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from North Caro-
lina is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, let me
say this. Chairwoman WATERS and I ne-
gotiated a bipartisan deal, and it was a
priority for me to ensure that this
agency of government didn’t discrimi-
nate against different energy sources—
high priority for Republicans and some
Democrats.
Coal country was at risk in these ne-
gotiations because there is an extreme
element of my colleagues on the other
side of the aisle who want to limit our
capacity to export American tech-
nology that uses coal, which is far
cleaner than what is being used around
the globe, and limit the export of our
natural resources that power our econ-
omy. So I am grateful that the par-
tisan bill before us did not go to that

very far left position that would have
limited our coal technology from being
used to export.
So my colleague, Mr. LAMB, rep-
resents a significant piece of historic
coal country. It makes it easier for
someone like him who represents the
interests of his district in that regard
to vote for this bill because they didn’t
include those extreme measures that
would have limited and particularly
hurt coal country and the technology
developed here in the United States on
the use of fossil fuels. So that is a laud-
atory thing.
Now, there are minor measures in
here that have sort of minor discrimi-
natory effects against the use of nu-
clear power and the measurement of
carbon, but not to the extent that I
feared in this bill. So I am grateful
that what is before us isn’t the most
extreme. It is just merely not helpful
to the export of certain American tech-
nologies and energy.
I am grateful that Chairwoman
WATERS didn’t decide to go to that far
left element that would have gone to
the extreme of saying we are not going
to export, specifically, coal technology
using the Export-Import Bank. That
limitation is not in here, and so I am
grateful for that.
So we have an amendment before us
that Mr. BURGESS of Texas offered to
say that, in particular, nuclear tech-
nology would be a helpful thing and an
emphasis for the Export-Import Bank.
My colleagues on the other side of the
aisle voted against that by voice vote,
and then they asked for a rollcall vote.
I anticipate that they will have a nega-
tive vote on their side on this, but it
shows that Republicans are interested
in the diverse array of energy sources
and making sure that we don’t dis-
criminate against our American tech-
nology being exported that is useful
globally.
So this amendment is fine. I think it
is important that we do measure jobs
and impact, specifically, on energy
jobs. In the bipartisan bill that Chair-
woman WATERS and I negotiated, I
pushed hard for a similar provision,
where the Bank would need to provide
job creation information to Congress.
That was stripped out. It is not before
us today.
So what the gentleman is offering is
constructive. It is good. It should have
a bipartisan vote. I thank the gen-
tleman for offering this, for having the
view and the eye of his constituents in
mind, specifically when it comes to en-
ergy production.
I know that western Pennsylvania
still has this great, strong, vibrant en-
ergy production capacity; and so I am
grateful that my colleague would offer
something that not only helps his dis-
trict, but also helps American job cre-
ation and ensures the Bank measures
that job creation.
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of
my time.
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentleman for his words, and again, I
would commend the chairwoman for in-
cluding all energy sources and tech-
nology in this bill.
I think our debate going forward will
be more honest and accurate when we
have a score of how many jobs have
been created, so we not only are talk-
ing about energy sources in the ab-
stract, but we can tie them to a spe-
cific job number for hardworking
American families.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from California (Ms.
PELOSI), the Speaker of the House of
Representatives.
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentleman for yielding, and I thank
him for his leadership in bringing this
amendment to the floor.
It is very important for us to quan-
tify just what this means as you re-
quire the agency to detail the effects of
exports and projects financed by the
agency on American jobs in energy and
related fields and industries. This en-
ergy issue is an essential issue to so
much of what commerce is about, espe-
cially in relationship to China as we
are discussing that today.
Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup-
port of the reauthorization of the Ex-
port-Import Bank, which, for nearly a
century, has been a force for creating
jobs, strengthening small businesses,
and advancing America’s entrepreneur-
ship and ingenuity in the world.
Mr. Chair, I thank Chairwoman
WATERS for her extraordinary leader-
ship. She has been relentless and per-
sistent in working on this legislation,
after a lifetime commitment to cre-
ating good-paying jobs and powering
growth that lifts up all communities.
We are blessed that she is in the posi-
tion that she is in as chair of the Fi-
nancial Services Committee, having
the authority and the authorization
power over the Ex-Im Bank.
When I was on the Appropriations
Committee, I chaired the State, For-
eign Operations, and Related Programs
Subcommittee, which funded the Ex-
Im Bank, so I know well the good work
that the Ex-Im Bank does, especially
reaching down into communities and
small businesses and suppliers across
the country.
Let me just say this about China. Mr.
MCHENRY and I share some similar
views on this subject, but I don’t think
that we should be taking the view of—
I can immodestly say, as I said to my
colleagues yesterday, I take second
place to no one in this Congress in
criticizing China for their human
rights violations, whether it is what
they are doing in Hong Kong now, anti-
democratic actions; what they are
doing to Uyghurs, the Muslims, 1 mil-
lion, 2 million, 3 million, who knows
how many people put into education
camps and then putting other people in
the homes of the people whom they
have put into the camps—it is against
humanity—what they are doing to un-
dermine the culture of Tibet, whether
it is the religion, the language, the cul-
ture of Tibet to resettle Hans there to
dilute the Tibetan culture; whether it
is what is going on all throughout
China: jailing journalists, human
rights lawyers, Christians, democracy
activists throughout the mainland.
So that is something that I have
fought with China for 30 years. I have
also fought them on their trade poli-
cies for 30 years, as well, all of this
since Tiananmen Square.
When we first started this fight, we
had a trade deficit with China of $5 bil-
lion a year, which I thought would be
useful in trying to improve the human
rights situation, freeing the prisoners
of Tiananmen Square, gaining access
to their markets, stopping their pri-
vacy of intellectual property and stop-
ping their proliferation of technologies
that could be used in weapons of mass
destruction to world countries.
$5 billion a year, oh, they would
never want to give that up. We could
get concessions. But the powers that be
and corporate America and all de-
manded that, no, we couldn’t do that.
If we just had peaceful evolution, that
would lead to all this democratization
and fairness in trade and stopping hos-
tile activities regarding weapons of
mass destruction and the rest.
It didn’t, and here we are 30 years
later. We won every vote in the House.
We couldn’t override vetoes of Demo-
cratic and Republican Presidents. I put
it at both doorsteps.
Here we are 30 years later. The trade
deficit is not $5 billion a year anymore;
it is more than $5 billion a week—a
week.
So I share your concerns about
human rights and other policies with
regard to China, but we cannot let Chi-
na’s inhumanity and cruelty take a
toll on America’s small businesses and
our economic opportunities.
And so, as I say, I established those
credentials to brag because I was right,
but also to say I work with China on
issues that relate to energy and cli-
mate and the rest of that because they
are big players in that.
It is very disappointing because, as I
have said, if, for commercial purposes,
we decide to ignore the human rights
violations perpetrated by China, we
lose all moral authority to challenge
anyone anyplace.
And so we continue to challenge
them, but we cannot empower them to
hurt our economy. And that is exactly
what we would do today if we were to
reject this reauthorization of the Ex-
Im Bank because of China.
I salute those who have put amend-
ments forward providing financing. The
Bank will not provide financing for any
individual sanctioned for human rights
and free speech violations, including in
China and including Hong Kong, or pro-
vide financing for those sanctions for
opioid trafficking, human trafficking,
or sex trafficking.
So I thank Chair WATERS for that,
and I congratulate Congresswoman
TORRES SMALL, Congressman
MCADAMS, Congressman ROSE, and
Congressman LAMB for their leadership

on so many pieces of improving this
legislation.
But I do urge our colleagues to recog-
nize what President Reagan said. The
Export-Import Bank ‘‘creates and sus-
tains jobs for millions of American
workers and contributes to the growth
and strength of the United States econ-
omy. The Export-Import Bank contrib-
utes in a significant way to our Nation.
. . .’’—Ronald Reagan.
This legislation ensures that the Ex-
Im Bank can continue to contribute to
our Nation’s strength in a way that is
good for American workers, American
businesses, and our values. I urge a
strong bipartisan vote.
I again commend the chairwoman for
her extraordinary leadership in getting
us to this point and associate myself
with some of the concerns that Mr.
MCHENRY has put forth.
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Chair, I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
If I may begin by commending the
Speaker, Speaker PELOSI. You won’t
hear this often, and probably won’t
hear it often from her, that she agrees
with me nor I with her; but when it
comes to China, we see it very simi-
larly.
Her track record is, indeed, long and
it is, indeed, strong when it comes to
human rights abuses, in particular
around religious minorities in China.
But, also, she has spoken out consist-
ently in her term of service here in
Congress against Chinese abuses.
b 1000
I think we should have a bipartisan
understanding. Sadly, when she says
that the earlier fight that she had with
China was hijacked by corporate Amer-
ica, sadly, the language that Chair-
woman WATERS and I attempted to
pass out of committee in good faith
was hijacked by corporate America, be-
cause they don’t want to see any limi-
tation on their capacity to get sub-
sidization from Ex-Im to export.
So I hope that we can come back to-
gether after this bill doesn’t go any-
where in the Senate, and we can come
back together on strong enough lan-
guage so that we can do something
proactive and together when it comes
to China.
Small businesses, indeed, need more
emphasis from the Ex-Im Bank, and
that is why I am saddened that it takes
10 years for this bill to actually raise
the small business mandate and tell
Ex-Im to prioritize small businesses.
So, again, it is a special moment
when, I think, we have folks on the left
and the right together on an important
economic issue like China. That is why
the underlying bill that we negotiated
was really important, and this is a bad
bill.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. COX of Cali-
fornia). The question is on the amend-
ment offered by the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. LAMB).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 16 OFFERED BY MR. ROUDA
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 16 printed
in House Report 116–289.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 5, beginning on line 2, strike ‘‘the ra-
cial, ethnic, and gender diversity’’ and insert
‘‘diversity in race, ethnicity, gender, sexual
orientation, and gender identity’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 695, the gentleman
from California (Mr. ROUDA) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Chair, I rise today
in support of my amendment to add
sexual orientation and gender identity
to the agency’s Office of Minority and
Women Inclusion standards for work-
force diversity.
The bill already requires the agency’s
newly established Office of Minority
and Women Inclusion to develop stand-
ards for equal employment opportunity
in the racial, ethnic, and gender diver-
sity of the workforce and senior man-
agement of the agency.
This agency, which aims to develop a
level playing field for American busi-
nesses in the global economy, must be
representative of and able to under-
stand all businesses across the country.
True diversity includes representation
of the LGBTQ community.
That is why I have offered this
amendment to add consideration of
sexual orientation and gender identity
as part of the agency’s equal oppor-
tunity and diversity standards for its
own workforce.
Mr. Chair, I ask that my colleagues
join me in supporting this amendment.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I claim
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment, although I am not opposed to it.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from North Caro-
lina is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I think it
is important that we promote these
policies. Again, what Chairwoman
WATERS and I negotiated in H.R. 3407,
which was a bipartisan product to re-
authorize the Export-Import Bank,
prioritized economic policy and na-
tional security policy. It prioritized in-
novative technologies, especially when
it comes to energy development, and it
put limitations on Ex-Im Bank sub-
sidizing Chinese foreign policy and eco-
nomic policy.
So additional social legislating is
fine. This is a social legislating reau-
thorization of the Export-Import Bank.
That is the emphasis Chairwoman
WATERS chose. The Democrats chose to
bring a bill that prioritized social pol-
icy over economic policy, so this is
probably a fine addition to it.
But if we are going to talk about di-
versity and ensuring diversity in the
workforce of the Export-Import Bank,
shouldn’t we also be talking about pro-
tection of religious minorities and
making sure that we are not sub-
sidizing products that are used to re-
press people in Hong Kong or religious
minorities in China? That is what cur-
rent Ex-Im policy permits.
There are examples of this. We have
strategic competitors, we have compa-
nies that have significant abuses, and
yet we are still doing business with
them through the Export-Import Bank.
I think that is bad policy.
We need to look no further than
Hong Kong or the Uighurs in China to
see the Chinese true intent here.
I wish there was the same vigor from
social policy applied by my Democratic
colleagues applied to thwarting the
ever-expanding Chinese Communist
Party’s actions through their state-
owned enterprises.
So, Mr. Chair, it is a fine amend-
ment, we should agree to it. I reserve
the balance of my time.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentleman from North Carolina for his
comments. I also thank the chair for
her leadership on this bill.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I yield
back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tleman from California (Mr. ROUDA).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 17 OFFERED BY MR. ROUDA
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 17 printed
in House Report 116–289.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Chair, I have an
amendment at the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:

persons with disabilities’’ and insert ‘‘per-
sons with disabilities, and individuals self-
identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, or queer’’.

from California (Mr. ROUDA) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from California.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Chair, I rise today
in support of my amendment to add
LGBTQ-owned businesses to the United
States Export Finance Agency’s small
business outreach plan.
American businesses, specifically
small businesses, are the backbone of
our economy and a cornerstone of the
American Dream.
The bill before us today requires the
agency to develop a comprehensive
outreach plan to ensure small business
owners are aware of the financing op-
tions available to them through the
agency. This plan already includes an
emphasis on outreach to businesses

I believe it is critical we include an
emphasis on outreach to LGBTQ entre-
preneurs as well, who create jobs
across the country and contribute hun-
dreds of billions of dollars to the U.S.
economy every year.
My amendment ensures all Ameri-
cans, regardless of who they are or who
they love, can access the tools needed
to jump-start their American Dream
and contribute to our economy.
It is a simple, but meaningful, step to
ensure greater equality on Main
Streets across the United States.
Mr. Chair, I ask that my colleagues
join me in supporting this amendment.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I claim
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment, although I am not opposed to it.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from North Caro-
lina is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, Repub-
licans unanimously voted for a bipar-
tisan agreement that Chairwoman
WATERS and I negotiated in the Finan-
cial Services Committee. I just want to
reiterate that.
The focus there was combating Chi-
nese aggression, it was focused on eco-
nomic policy. There were a number of
bipartisan tradeoffs in order to ensure
that the Bank was focused on economic
policy, not mainly on social policy, but
what we have before us is mainly a so-
cial policy-related reauthorization of
this important economic institution.
I think it is important that all busi-
nesses be considered and have signifi-
cant small business outreach by the
agency. This is a significant addition
to it, and I think it is worthy of sup-
port.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
vote ‘‘yes.’’
Unfortunately, what we have before
us is really a sideshow and a waste of
time while the impeachment hearings
are going on. It is quite a filler for the
House floor for a bill that won’t make
it into law.
So here we go. We have wasted a sig-
nificant week here on the House floor
with something that is not going to ac-
tually end up anywhere.
So there we go. The amendment is
fine to support, but let’s just get this
thing over with.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Chair, I thank the
gentleman from North Carolina for his
support for the bill, and once again I
thank Madam Chair for her extraor-
dinary leadership on this bill.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

AMENDMENT NO. 18 OFFERED BY MS. STEVENS
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 18 printed
in House Report 116–289.
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Chair, I have an

(D) an emphasis on outreach to small busi-
nesses in sectors impacted by retaliatory
tariffs.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 695, the gentlewoman
from Michigan (Ms. STEVENS) and a
Member opposed each will control 5
minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan.
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Chair, I rise
today to encourage my colleagues to
support my amendment, which would
direct the newly titled United States
Export Finance Agency to include in
its outreach plan an emphasis on small
businesses in sectors impacted by re-
taliatory tariffs.
For nearly a century, the Export-Im-
port Bank has been a powerful force for
creating the good-paying jobs of the fu-
ture by ensuring that small businesses
can compete on a fair and global play-
ing field.
Mr. Chair, today we recognize our
phenomenal chair of the Financial
Services Committee for her leadership
and stewardship in seeing us to this
point.
It has been through consistency, it
has been through commitment to our
small businesses that we arrive at this
place where today we will be voting
this bill into law, for we must compete
in foreign markets, we must not cede
any ground to China, and we certainly
must prevent any uncertainty making
its way into our marketplace here in
America.
So that is why today is particularly
significant if we reflect on the past
when it was called into question if this
Export-Import Bank would be reau-
thorized. Today we are renaming it and
reclaiming our ground.
Just this year, the Export-Import
Bank has financed approximately $9
million of exports from companies in
my district in southeastern Michigan,
helping small and mid-size businesses
reach global markets that they would
not otherwise be able to access, selling
best-in-class products from a best-in-
class workforce in southeastern Michi-
gan to the markets who desire it.
This bipartisan initiative is critical
for advancing America’s economic pre-
eminence in the world and lifting up
communities in a place where I call
home.
Many of us have heard from busi-
nesses in our districts about the nega-
tive impact of tariffs on their bottom
lines and on their export activities. In
no short order have I heard that being
repeated in southeastern Michigan, in
the hub of American manufacturing,
particularly for automotive.
Taxpayers in Michigan alone have
paid $1.6 billion so far in additional tar-
iffs that were placed on imported prod-
ucts between May 2018 and August 2019.
Our Michigan businesses, including
manufacturers and farmers, have faced
$589 million in new retaliatory tariffs
as a direct result of the trade actions
taken by the current administration.
This isn’t winning.
It is no coincidence that exports from
my State as a result are projected to
drop 7 percent this year alone.
b 1015
Now, more than ever, we must be
paying attention to the needs of our
small and midsized businesses, which
are bearing the brunt of a self-inflicted
and go-it-alone trade war. Our friendly
reminder is that small businesses are
the lifeblood of our U.S. economy,
making up over 99 percent of all firms
in this country.
As the Export-Import Bank con-
tinues to help businesses access new
markets—small businesses that have
been harmed by retaliatory tariffs—
they must be a part of this central mis-
sion.
The reauthorization that we are pass-
ing here today has the support of a
wide range of stakeholders—quite re-
markable—from the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce to the National Association
of Manufacturers to the AFL–CIO.
Our workforce will benefit from this
action. Our economy will benefit from
this legislation.
I urge my colleagues on both sides of
the aisle to join me in ensuring our
small businesses reeling from the tar-
iffs know that they are supported by
the great resources of the U.S. Export
Finance Agency.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Chair-
man, I claim the time in opposition, al-
though I am not opposed to the amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman is recognized for 5
minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Chair-
man, once again, we are on the floor
talking about the importance of the ex-
port agency to small business. It is im-
portant to small business, which is
why, in the Waters-McHenry bipartisan
compromise, we had a strong, well-ar-
gued, well-focused, well-delivered pol-
icy for small business that, unfortu-
nately, Mr. Chairman, is now not in
the bill before us today.
I want to compliment Mr. MCHENRY
and Ms. WATERS for their work to-
gether. I wish the Speaker had come to
their aid in June to whip the vote for
their well-argued compromise. Al-
though, I want to associate myself, as
well, with the Speaker’s strong com-
ments about China and the 30 years
that America has tried since
Tiananmen Square to change China’s
mercantilistic trade policy and be part
of the world economy, and it hasn’t

worked. The Speaker outlined it beau-
tifully today. She talked about her 30-
year commitment there.
Again, if we want to stop retaliatory
tariffs and worrying about retaliatory
tariffs, we should use every tool in our
armory here to push back against
China, to change China’s mercantilistic
policy. We have done that with CFIUS
reform in this House on a bipartisan
basis. We have done that with the Asia
Reassurance Act in this House on a bi-
partisan basis. We could have used the
Export Finance Agency on a bipartisan
basis in a very conscious manner to
make sure that the Ex-Im agency cred-
its don’t benefit China and their ability
to extend their One Belt, One Road
work around the world.
I appreciate my friend from Michi-
gan’s amendment. I appreciate her sup-
port of small business. I appreciate her
support of trying to measure the im-
pact of retaliatory tariffs on small
business and agriculture, for that mat-
ter.
But we would be much more effec-
tive, Mr. Chairman, if we had adopted
the underlying bill with its better posi-
tion to support small business and its
better position to strike back against
the mercantilistic trade policies of
China.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Chairman, I
think ringing throughout this amend-
ment is the importance of our manu-
facturing economy. That is also what
we are standing up here today to de-
liver for manufacturers, small busi-
nesses, and our labor force here in
Michigan.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from California (Ms.
WATERS), the chairwoman of the Fi-
nancial Services Committee.
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentlewoman for offering this
thoughtful amendment.
This amendment strengthens the
bill’s emphasis on small business.
While we have a lot in this bill for
small businesses, the gentlewoman’s
amendment further strengthens these
efforts by requiring that the agency
emphasize outreach to small businesses
in sectors that have been impacted by
retaliatory tariffs.
Mr. Chairman, I strongly support the
gentlewoman’s amendment to further
help small businesses that have been
caught up in this tariff war.
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Chairman, I yield
back the balance of my time.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Chair-
man, again, I don’t oppose this amend-
ment. I urge its adoption. But I, again,
remind this House that we had a better
policy in the bipartisan Waters-
McHenry bill that would do more for
small business and that Republicans
support a reauthorization of the Ex-
port-Import Bank, the export agency.
We want that opportunity.
This bill, as designed, is not going to
be voted on in the Senate and not
going to become law. I look forward to
the day when we are back on the House
floor doing a bipartisan reauthoriza-
tion of the Ex-Im Bank.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at
the desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:
Page 33, after line 22, insert the following:
SEC. ll. GAO REPORT ON THE EFFECT OF
AGENCY CLOSURE ON BUSINESSES
THAT USE AGENCY SERVICES.
Within 1 year after the date of the enact-
ment of this Act, the Comptroller General
shall submit to the Congress a written report
on the effect that closure of the United
States Export Finance Agency would have
on businesses that use services of the United
States Export Finance Agency.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 695, the gentlewoman
from Oklahoma (Ms. KENDRA S. HORN)
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Oklahoma.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time
as I may consume.
Mr. Chairman, the Export-Import
Bank is a critically important tool in
the economic toolbox for Oklahoma
businesses and workers. The Ex-Im
Bank has long helped Oklahoma busi-
nesses sell their products to the global
marketplace, opening the door for our
economy to enter global commerce.
Over the last 5 years alone, the Ex-Im
Bank’s partnership with businesses
across my State has resulted in the ex-
port of more than $500 million in goods
around the world.
My amendment would require the
GAO to submit to Congress, within 1
year, a report about the impact that
closure of the Export-Import Bank
would have on businesses that utilize
the Bank’s services.
I have visited with businesses across
my State and district about the use of
the Export-Import Bank and learned
from them how the services of the Ex-
Im Bank helped them to export their
products. One important service that
they shared with me is the Export-Im-
port Bank’s credit insurance program.
This program allows businesses to pur-
chase insurance and acts as a safety
net in the case where a foreign buyer
does not fully pay for the product that
was exported.
One company in my district is the
Mills Machine Company, located in
Shawnee, Oklahoma. This small busi-
ness, established in 1908, is a family-
owned custom manufacturer and world-
wide exporter of earth drilling tools
and bits. Chuck Mills, the president of
Mills Machine Company, shared that
the Export-Import Bank’s credit insur-
ance program allows his company to
offer open account terms to their cus-
tomers with minimal risk.
When the Ex-Im Bank’s reauthoriza-
tion lapsed in 2015, Mr. Mills searched
the private market for similar insur-
ance to the Ex-Im Bank but couldn’t
find anything remotely comparable.
His business slowed until the Bank’s
reauthorization later this year.
The Bank’s lapsed reauthorization in
2015 gave us but a small window into
the economic hardship that would re-
sult if the Export-Import Bank perma-
nently closed for the Mills Machine
Company and many other similar busi-
nesses across this country. My amend-
ment would help us further understand
the impact closure of the Export-Im-
port Bank would have on businesses
across this country.
I urge my colleagues to support this
amendment and the reauthorization of
this bill so American businesses across
this country and in Oklahoma can con-
tinue to utilize the Bank to grow their
businesses and export American prod-
ucts to the world.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Chair-
man, I claim the time in opposition, al-
though I am not opposed to the amend-
ment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman is recognized for 5
minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Chair-
man, first, let me say, as we talked
about this morning, the Republicans
supported unanimously the Waters-
McHenry bipartisan deal to reauthorize
the Bank with a long, constructive re-
authorization.
Let me also thank the gentlewoman
from Oklahoma for offering the amend-
ment to think about the idea of what
would be the downside to her constitu-
ents and to American business were the
Bank to close. I would argue that is
not a prospect here but will be useful
information to future policymakers.
Why do I have that point of view?
Well, there is a plan to extend this
Bank. It will not lapse.
If we had done the Waters-McHenry
bill, we wouldn’t even be on the House
floor today. We would already have
this signed into law, through the Sen-
ate, and on its way to the President’s
desk. But we are here today because
this bill is not going to be taken up in
the Senate, and this Bank is, most

likely, in the interim, going to be reau-
thorized through the appropriations
process. But I think informing policy-
makers of the risks of it being closed is
good.
Let me also say that President
Trump considers the export agency an
important tool in his economic outfit,
his economic choice of opportunities to
support American business, to increase
trade in exports, to counter the One
Belt, One Road initiative of China.
Again, the Waters-McHenry bill would
have done a better job on that.
The President has appointed Direc-
tors of the Ex-Im Bank that are fully
functioning. The new President, Kim
Reed, is doing a good job in running
the Ex-Im Bank. So the Ex-Im Bank is
in good shape with a good board and
with a good mission and would have
been made stronger and better by the
Waters-McHenry bill.
I think this information that the
gentlewoman from Oklahoma suggests
will be useful to future policymakers,
and I certainly don’t have a problem
with the amendment going forward.
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance
of my time.
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Mr. Chairman, I will close by saying,
the information that this amendment
would provide will help us to have a
broader picture of the economic impact
and benefits of the services and the
benefits of the Export-Import Bank.
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues
to support this amendment and the un-
derlying bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman
from Michigan.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair-
man, my amendment seeks to recog-
nize the role that workers everywhere
play in supporting American exports
and to ensure that this vital constitu-
ency has a voice in projects that im-
pact them directly.
While the Export-Import Bank works
to help grow American jobs, we must
not forget the impact American export
projects have on workers and their
communities abroad.
International trade is crucial to a
strong American economy, but it must
go beyond benefiting corporations
only. It must raise the standard of liv-
ing for workers in all countries in-
volved. Trade should not come at the
cost of foreign workers any more than
it should come at the cost of the Amer-
ican middle class.
b 1030
In fact, only when we help raise the
standard of living in other countries
will we end the hemorrhage of Amer-
ican jobs to countries with rock-bot-
tom wages and inadequate protections
for workers’ safety and the environ-
ment.
This bill already requires consulta-
tion with communities potentially im-
pacted by the projects it finances, and
my amendment simply makes clear
that the workers in these communities
must be consulted as well. This way
workers will have a voice in the
projects that directly affect them.
My amendment also works to ensure
that Congress has the best information
possible in determining how these poli-
cies are implemented. The bedrock of
good policy is good information, and
the only way for us to truly judge the
quality of our actions today is to en-
sure that we know how our ideas are
carried out.
The law already includes robust re-
porting requirements, and my amend-
ment includes a simple addition to re-
quire an explanation of the ways in
which these potentially impacted com-
munities, including workers, are con-
sulted.
Back in my district, I am consist-
ently heartened to see the solidarity
among teachers, autoworkers, and so
many others in Macomb County and
Oakland County, Michigan. By passing
my amendment, we can make clear
that we, too, stand in solidarity with
workers all around the world.
I urge my colleagues to support this
simple, yet necessary, amendment, and
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I claim
the time in opposition, although I am
not opposed to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-

lina is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, we did
have a bipartisan bill that we nego-
tiated. That is not before us today.
That bill would have combated Chinese
aggression.
What we have before us is a partisan
bill, and the partisan bill is focused
more on social policy than economic
policy. It doesn’t link up our American
foreign policy and economic interest
with the charter of this institution, so
it is a huge, missed opportunity.
This amendment would take a good
step in promoting accountability for
the effects of projects financed by the
Bank. I appreciate the gentleman’s in-
terest in helping communities and en-
suring the Bank has that focus. We
welcome this transparency and ac-
countability.
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of
my time.
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair-
man, I appreciate the gentleman’s
words, and I look forward to con-
tinuing to work with him in the spirit
of bipartisanship.
I yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN).
The amendment was agreed to.
AMENDMENT NO. 21 OFFERED BY MS. TORRES
SMALL OF NEW MEXICO
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order
to consider amendment No. 21 printed
in House Report 116–289.
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico.
Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the
desk.
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will
designate the amendment.
The text of the amendment is as
follows:
Page 21, line 9, strike ‘‘or’’.
Page 21, after line 9, insert the following:
‘‘(C) sanctions relating to human rights
abuses, including engaging in human traf-
ficking, including sex trafficking, and any
sanctions imposed under Executive Order
13581 (Blocking Property of Transnational
Criminal Organizations); or’’.
Page 21, line 10, strike ‘‘(C)’’ and insert
‘‘(D)’’.
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to
House Resolution 695, the gentlewoman
from New Mexico (Ms. TORRES SMALL)
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes.
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New Mexico.
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico.
Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as
I may consume.
Mr. Chair, I rise to offer amendment
No. 21 to H.R. 4863, the United States
Export Finance Agency Act of 2019.
Today’s world shows an alarming
trend: Human trafficking is on the rise.
A report published earlier this year by
the United Nations Office on Drugs and
Crime found the global trend has in-
creased steadily since 2010.
This is an issue found worldwide, in
the United States, and in my home
State of New Mexico. Women and girls
are especially targeted.
We know that these victims are sexu-
ally exploited and forced into labor,
slavery, or forms of servitude by per-
petrators who manipulate them using

coercion, fraud, deception, and abduc-
tion.
That is why New Mexico has
launched a number of interagency ini-
tiatives and collaborations with non-
profits and the Federal Government to
prevent, prosecute, and protect sex
trafficking survivors.
That is why the Ex-Im reauthoriza-
tion bill we are voting on today in-
cludes forcefully stated and required
exclusions to prohibit the Bank’s board
of directors from approving trans-
actions with end users, obligors, and
lenders involved in sanctionable activi-
ties and other violations of law.
But to reinforce the point about this
particularly menacing crime, I am of-
fering this amendment to make it clear
that these prohibitions against entities
and individuals sanctioned for global
human rights abuses include those who
recruit, transport, transfer, harbor, re-
ceive, or facilitate the trafficking of
men, women, and children.
Sanctions alone are rarely, if ever,
the entire solution to human rights or
corruption crises, but they play an
enormously important role to stop
money from going to bad actors who
seek to do bad things around the world.
Every time we use these tools to dis-
rupt that flow of money, we keep our
country safer.
This applies to individuals, but also
to the transnational criminal organiza-
tions which, among other bad acts,
manage the networks that exploit and
facilitate the abuse of sex trafficking
victims in the U.S. and abroad.
Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues
to join together to support this amend-
ment and the underlying bill to offer a
united, bipartisan front against human
trafficking.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chairman, I
claim the time in opposition, although
I am not opposed to the amendment.
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from North Caro-
lina is recognized for 5 minutes.
There was no objection.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, going
back to the bill that Chairwoman
WATERS and I negotiated that we filed
as H.R. 3407, we took on some of these
tough issues about human rights
abuses and did it in an aggressive way,
especially when it pertains to China.
The amendment here is fine. It actu-
ally will have zero effect, though, be-
cause, if you are a sanctioned entity,
American businesses are prohibited
from doing business with you. So what
this says is not only are you prohibited
from doing the business, you also can’t
get financing for the business you are
not permitted to do.
Okay. That is fine. You can put it in
the bill or you cannot put it in the bill.
Ex-Im will not finance a business that
is prohibited under law.
So now the gentlewoman is saying
they are prohibited under law from get-
ting financing. Okay. That is good.
Again, it is a nice cover for what was
gutted out of the bill that Chairwoman
WATERS and I negotiated, which actu-
ally did tough things. In that legisla-
tion, Republicans sought to restrict
Ex-Im assistance for entities involved
in sanctionable human rights abuses,
including human trafficking and sex
trafficking.
It goes beyond this amendment.
Rather than support those provisions,
Democrats decided to allow this
amendment, which is simply a watered-
down version of that provision that Re-
publicans supported in committee.
It will do nothing. It will do nothing
in fact; it will do nothing in law. And
so this is much more about political
cover, and I will tell you how I will
know.
I am not going to ask for a rollcall
vote on this, but I would suspect my
Democrat colleagues will ask for a roll-
call vote on this amendment so it gives
them political cover rather than actu-
ally do something of substance.
Tens of millions of individuals,
worldwide, are victims of human traf-
ficking. It is a tragedy. It is awful.
This amendment will not have any ef-
fect on stopping human trafficking and
human rights abuses, and, in fact, it
merely restates existing law rather
than striking meaningful steps toward
ending these horrific practices. So that
is fine.
I commend my colleague for offering
this. It gives a number of their col-
leagues who wish to have a watered-
down bill before us, it gives them polit-
ical cover, but it is simply a restate-
ment of existing law.
I reserve the balance of my time.
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico.
Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the
gentlewoman from California (Ms.
WATERS).
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I thank
the gentlewoman for offering this
thoughtful amendment.
This amendment prohibits the Bank
from providing financing to a person
involved in sanctionable activity relat-
ing to human rights abuses, specifi-
cally human trafficking, including sex
trafficking.
I strongly support the gentlewoman’s
amendment to strengthen this bill with
respect to combating human traf-
ficking, including sex trafficking, and,
of course, I urge all of my colleagues to
do so.
This makes our bill stronger. This is
the most important piece of legisla-
tion, and the Export-Import Bank is
significant in the fact that it has pro-
vided 1.5 million jobs over the past 10
years, supported businesses to the tune
of $255 billion, and made money for our
Treasury to the tune of about $3.4 mil-
lion.
Every amendment that has come be-
fore us today has made this a stronger
and stronger piece of legislation.
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the
gentlewoman has expired.
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico.
Mr. Chair, I yield the gentlewoman
from California an additional 1 minute.
Ms. WATERS. I am sorry that the
gentleman from North Carolina is still
bemoaning the fact that the first bill
that we negotiated is not before us.
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Chair, I yield
myself the balance of my time.
As we close this debate, and this is
the last amendment before us, I do
want to reiterate that I am grateful to
Chairwoman WATERS. Again, I want to
thank the gentlewoman for ignoring
the requests from the extreme left of
her own party and their demands for
having the Bank ban coal technology
exports.
There are some minor environmental
provisions in here that have a negative
impact on American industries and
their ability to sell overseas, but I am
grateful that she ignored the request
from members of her party on the ex-
treme left and their demands to tell
the Bank to stop funding coal and only
fund clean energy projects; so the Bank
will continue to be able to fund coal
and cleaner coal technology exports in
adherence with the environmental
standards of the regime they are send-
ing.
It could have been absolutely dev-
astating in terms of the consequences
on energy production, but they simply
chose to do minor things. I think that
is a laudatory thing that deserves some
bipartisan praise that the extreme left
did not win the day in terms of that
piece of policy in this bill.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
vote ‘‘no’’ on final passage of this bill.
We will have an extension of the Bank.
We will continue to use Export-Import
financing for perhaps up to 2 percent of
our exports. That will be a helpful
thing.
But what we need to do is focus, also,
on combating the rise of Chinese ag-
gression economically, and I think we
have that capacity. This is not the way
to do it. This bill is going nowhere in
the Senate. The President has already
said that he will veto it.
So let’s get on with the business of
the American people, and let’s get back
to sensible policy discussions here.
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to
support this amendment—though it
will have no impact whatsoever; it is a
restatement of existing law; it is fine,
but it doesn’t actually have real teeth
to it—and vote ‘‘no’’ on the final pas-
sage of this bill.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. TORRES SMALL of New Mexico.
Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairwoman
WATERS and the advocates fighting for
the Bank’s reauthorization.
Again, we must ensure that bad ac-
tors who seek to do bad things around
the world don’t profit from their
crimes. I urge my colleagues to support
this amendment and final passage of
the bill.
I yield back the balance of my time.
The Acting CHAIR. The question is
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from New Mexico (Ms.
TORRES SMALL).
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE ACTING CHAIR
The Acting CHAIR (during the vote).
There is 1 minute remaining.
b 1117
Messrs. GARCIA of Illinois and COX
of California changed their vote from
‘‘aye’’ to ‘‘no.’’
So the amendment was rejected.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
Stated against:
Mr. VELA. Mr. Chair, during a long vote se-
ries today, I unintentionally voted aye on the
Flores Amendment to H.R. 4863 United States
Export Finance Agency Act, on rollcall number

SEC. ll. LIMITATION ON FINANCIAL ASSIST-
ANCE FOR THE CHINESE GOVERN-
MENT.
Section 2 of the Export-Import Bank Act of
1945 (12 U.S.C. 635), as amended by the pre-
ceding provisions of this Act, is amended by
adding at the end the following:
‘‘(n) LIMITATION ON FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
FOR THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT.—
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The Agency may not
provide a loan, guarantee, or insurance bene-
fitting the Government of China (whether as
a lender, obligor, or end user), with respect
to which credit assistance from the Agency
is first sought after the effective date of this
subsection, if the lender, obligor, or end user
knowingly provides significant financial,
material, technological, or other support to,
or significant goods or services in support of
any of the following policies, activities, or
entities of the Government of China:
‘‘(A) The People’s Liberation Army.
‘‘(B) The Ministry of State Security.
‘‘(C) The Belt and Road Initiative (or any
successor or comparable initiative of that
government).
‘‘(D) Gross violations of internationally
recognized human rights (as defined in sec-
tion 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act of
1961 (22 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1))), including such vio-
lations with respect to ethnic or religious
minorities in China.
‘‘(E) The theft of United States intellec-
tual property or the illicit transfer of tech-
nology from a United States person.
‘‘(2) EXEMPTION.—Paragraph (1) shall not
apply to a loan, guarantee, or insurance
which—
‘‘(A) would enable exports directly by
United States small business concerns; or
‘‘(B) is required for the export of humani-
tarian goods or services, including life-
saving, rescue, and medical equipment (such
as ambulances, firefighting vehicles, hospital
supplies, and medical devices).
‘‘(3) PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER.—The President
may waive any requirement of paragraph (1)
for up to 1 year at a time, on reporting in
writing to the committees specified in para-
graph (1) that the waiver is essential to the
national interest of the United States, with
a detailed explanation of the reasons there-
for.
‘‘(4) DEFINITIONS.—In paragraph (1):
‘‘(A) GOVERNMENT OF CHINA.—The term
‘Government of China’ means—
‘‘(i) the state and the Government of
China, as well as any political subdivision,
agency, or instrumentality thereof;
‘‘(ii) any entity owned or controlled, di-
rectly or indirectly, by any of the foregoing,
including any corporation, partnership, asso-
ciation, or other entity in which any of the
foregoing owns a 50 percent or greater inter-
est or a controlling interest, and any entity
which is otherwise controlled by any of the
foregoing;
‘‘(iii) any person that is or has been acting
or purporting to act, directly or indirectly,
for or on behalf of any of the foregoing; and
‘‘(iv) any other person which the Secretary
of the Treasury determines is included in
any of the foregoing.
‘‘(B) KNOWINGLY.—The term ‘knowingly’,
with respect to conduct, a circumstance, or a
result, means that a person has actual
knowledge, or should have known, of the
conduct, the circumstance, or the result.’’.
Mr. RIGGLEMAN (during the read-
ing). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous
consent to dispense with the reading.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia?
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from
Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes in
support of his motion.
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, this
amendment will not kill the bill but
simply strengthen it so the House can
send a strong message to China.
I offer this MTR for a very simple
reason: China is a problem. China is a
major human rights violator; China is
responsible for unprecedented amounts
of personal data and intellectual prop-
erty theft; and China’s military seeks
to extend its reach throughout the
world.
Based on my experience in the De-
partment of Defense and in intelligence
communities, I can personally attest to
the multitude of threats China poses.
If my colleagues across the aisle be-
lieve that part of a healthy Ex-Im
Bank is ignoring the issues China pre-
sents, then go ahead and vote against
this MTR and guarantee uncertainty
for long-term Ex-Im reauthorization.
But if, like me, you understand and
care about what happens to freedom
and democracy around the world, and if
you care about human rights around
the world and you want to see the
Bank reauthorized with a purpose, then
please join me in supporting this MTR
that imposes necessary and just re-
quirements for entities wishing to do
business with Chinese state-owned en-
terprises.
I want to share a quote from our
Speaker of the House on China. When
speaking to a group of survivors at the
30-year anniversary of Tiananmen
Square, Speaker PELOSI said: ‘‘We can-
not allow economic interests with
China to blind us to the moral injus-
tices committed by China.’’ And about
an hour ago, the Speaker came to the
well and documented Chinese human
rights abuses and actions and said, ‘‘It
is against humanity.’’
Well said, Madam Speaker. I couldn’t
agree more. I would also like to add
that missing from that quote is that
we should not allow economic interests
with China to blind us to the threats of
national security.
In that same vein, earlier this week,
the Financial Services Committee held
a hearing focused on multilateral de-
velopment banks. My colleague, Mr.
SHERMAN, who is the chair of the Asia,
the Pacific, and Nonproliferation Sub-
committee of the House Foreign Af-
fairs Committee, attended that hearing
and spoke eloquently and forcefully,
arguing: ‘‘As long as China benefits one
penny from this institution, it is an at-
tack on the national security of the
United States.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8900 November 15, 2019
Well, if Mr. SHERMAN is alarmed by
World Bank loans benefiting small-
scale farmers in China, surely he and
his colleagues don’t want Ex-Im assist-
ance supporting China’s largest semi-
conductor manufacturer, China’s major
technology providers such as Huawei,
or China’s Export-Import Banks or
their state-owned shipping groups that
are taking over ports in Europe, South
America and other parts of the world
as we speak.
The questions we face today are not
partisan. The question is: Do we as
Americans, as Members of Congress
that have sworn an oath to protect this
country, allow Ex-Im to finance Chi-
nese Government-controlled entities
that are building military installations
in the South China Sea, installations
which one day may threaten the lives
of U.S. servicemembers?
Do we allow Ex-Im to support Chi-
nese companies that support Beijing’s
brutal oppression of religious minori-
ties in western China or the surveil-
lance of freedom-loving protesters in
Hong Kong?
I use these examples to make the
point that we are united in this body,
and we should be. It is easy, it is sim-
ple, and it is good for America and
American businesses and good for the
millions of oppressed people in China
that we pass this MTR.
To make this amendment even easier
to implement, it does not mandate any
particular bureaucratic procedures for
Ex-Im. My amendment achieves the
same objective of the original bipar-
tisan Waters-McHenry agreement, but
provides more flexibility so that Ex-Im
can remain nimble.
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like
to say to all of my colleagues who
claim to be interested in helping Amer-
ican workers and American businesses
two things: pass USMCA, pass an Ex-
Im reauthorization that is tough on
China and also good for American
workers. These things are not mutu-
ally exclusive.
To borrow the phrase so many of my
colleagues like to use: We can walk and
chew gum at the same time. And we
could do it easily today with bipartisan
support. If the people’s House does the
people’s business, then the Senate will
take those measures up and the Presi-
dent will sign them into law and your
constituents will thank you for it.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. HECK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in op-
position to the motion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Washington is recognized
for 5 minutes.
Mr. HECK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today
in strong opposition to this motion, be-
cause I also rise, as I have so many
times before, as a strong supporter of
the Export-Import Bank, and I am
going to tell you why.
It is because I want us to be a nation
that builds things. I want the most ad-
vanced factories in the world, building
the most complex goods invented, to be
located in America and filled with
American workers. That is what I
want. And I actually think we all, all
435 of us, want that.
We vote for manufacturing tax
breaks. We vote for infrastructure to
improve the shipment of manufactured
goods. We vote for programs to develop
a manufacturing workforce.
Those bills are not controversial, be-
cause we all want American manufac-
turers to keep their production facili-
ties here. We want them to tap into
new markets and add more ships and
keep increasing good-paying jobs that
don’t require a mountain of college
debt.
But to do that, we must have a ro-
bust export credit agency. Private mar-
kets simply cannot meet the needs of
our smallest and largest exporters.
Every other major economy in the
world has figured this out. They all set
up export credit agencies to boost their
manufacturers. Only the U.S. alone
sabotages itself.
For 7 years I have been fighting to
end this sabotage and to restore the
Bank to its rightful place supporting
manufacturing jobs, and we are slowly
succeeding, but none of it has come
easy.
Over 7 years, the opponents of the
Bank have evolved in their tactics.
At first, they outright opposed the
Bank and called for it to be shuttered.
Ultimately, those arguments failed, be-
cause we didn’t want to unilaterally
disarm.
Next, they claimed to support the
Ex-Im, but only if the agency’s charter
was crippled in its support for our most
advanced manufacturing goods. They
would restrict the Bank from backing
sales in—listen to this, Mr. Speaker—
U.S. locomotives and aircrafts and tur-
bines to our largest foreign markets.
Again, these arguments failed, because
we knew our purpose was to support
American workers.
Finally, in the last few weeks, we
have come to this point where support
of Ex-Im is conditioned on turning it
into a foreign policy agency, but these
arguments must fail too.
Everyone on both sides of the Cham-
ber wants to do more to combat the
near peer competition of China and all
the threat that they pose to our system
of government and our values, but pas-
sion untempered by expertise can lead
to some very bad outcomes.
The truth is, the Financial Services
Committee does not have the expertise
necessary to make China policy. The
Ex-Im Bank does not have the exper-
tise either, and I fear that making it to
do so will lead to very bad outcomes,
loss of U.S. goods and lost jobs for U.S.
workers.
The MTR would create one-way sales.
They are going to sell to us, but we
can’t sell to them.
A version of this amendment was re-
jected in committee not once, not
twice, not three times, but seven
times. No more sales to railroads or to
utilities or of airplanes.
There is a better way, and it is in-
cluded in the underlying bill, that is
sharply focused and targeted to hold
China accountable.
I understand the frustration with
China, as I have sat on this floor be-
fore. You know what? If we want to re-
litigate admission of China into the
WTO, bring it out. Let’s have that de-
bate, but let’s not do it under the sub-
terfuge of trying to cripple and hamper
the Export-Import Bank.
There is an exemption in this bill
supposedly for small businesses. Mr.
Speaker, when are the Republicans
going to get into their heads the notion
of a supply chain? Big businesses have
massive supply chains made up of
what? Small businesses.
If we pass this MTR, I guarantee this
is what is going to happen: increased
bankruptcy, factory workers laid off,
factories closed in America. That is
what will happen. Let’s not shoot our-
selves in the foot.
Mr. Speaker, if the Republicans want
us to be a nation that builds the most
sophisticated machines on land, on sea,
in the air, in space, if the Republicans
want us to be a nation that sends its
goods around the world, defeat this mo-
tion, support this bill, and put the Ex-
Im on a strong footing to meet the
challenges of the decade to come.
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance
of my time.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit.
There was no objection.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
question is on the motion to recommit.
The question was taken; and the
Speaker pro tempore announced that
the noes appeared to have it.
RECORDED VOTE
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I de-
mand a recorded vote.
A recorded vote was ordered.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair
will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum
time for any electronic vote on passage
of the bill.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE
The SPEAKER pro tempore (during
the vote). There are 2 minutes remain-
ing.
b 1204
So the bill was passed.
The result of the vote was announced
as above recorded.
A motion to reconsider was laid on
the table.
f
PERSONAL EXPLANATION
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, on
rollcall No. 619, I was detained. If I was
present, I would have voted ‘‘aye’’ on
the McAdams amendment to H.R. 4863,
the United States Export Finance
Agency Act.
f
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I
yield to the gentleman from Maryland
(Mr. HOYER), for the purpose of inquir-
ing from the majority leader the House
floor schedule next week.
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
On Monday, the House will meet at 12
p.m. for morning-hour debate and 2
p.m. for legislative business, with votes
postponed until 6:30 p.m.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the
House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-
hour debate and 12 p.m. for legislative
business.
On Thursday, the House will meet at
9 a.m. for legislative business. Last
votes of the week are expected no later
than 3 p.m.
Madam Speaker, we will consider
several bills under suspension of the
rules, including H.R. 4634, the Ter-
rorism Risk Insurance Program Reau-
thorization Act, a very significant and
very bipartisan bill.
The complete list of suspension bills
will be announced by the close of busi-
ness today.
In addition, Madam Speaker, the
House will be considering a continuing
resolution through December 20 to
keep the government open and oper-
ating on behalf of the American people.
Madam Speaker, I am deeply dis-
appointed by the Senate’s failure to
complete their work on appropriations,
forcing us to consider another con-
tinuing resolution. This is evidence of
failure, not of success. It is absolutely
essential that we pass the CR to keep
our government operating, but it is an
indication that we have not gotten our
business done as we should.
I would remind House Members that
we passed 96 percent of the funding of
government by June 26 this year, or ap-
proximately 3 months before the end of
the fiscal year, a little over 3 months.
By the end of the fiscal year, the
United States Senate had passed not a
single appropriations bill. I am dis-
appointed by that but recognize that
passing a CR is absolutely essential.
Rather than kick the can further
down the road, however, we must use
that time between now and December
20 to work on an agreement on 302(b)
allocations, which will allow us to
move appropriation bills done in line
with the bipartisan budget caps agree-
ment.
Lastly, Madam Speaker, the House
will consider H.R. 1309, the Workplace
Violence Prevention for Health Care
and Social Service Workers Act. This
bipartisan bill directs the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration to
issue a standard requiring healthcare
and social service employers to write
and implement a workplace violence
prevention plan to prevent and protect
employees from violent incidents at
work.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for walking
through the schedule.
As we have been hearing about the
CR, I express similar disappointment
that we have not been able to get the
full-year appropriations bill agreed
upon by both the House and the Sen-
ate, as we worked incredibly hard to
get a 2-year budget deal, a very bipar-
tisan agreement.
The objective of getting a 2-year
budget deal in last year’s Congress was
to ensure that we could agree on levels
of funding for our troops, which we did
to make sure that, instead of having
CRs, we were actually able to have a
full-year spending bill that is agreed to
by both sides so that we can get cer-
tainty to our troops. They are not get-
ting the tools they need.
We already agreed on the levels of
funding, and yet, there is still not an
agreed negotiation. This is not a case
where the House can just sit back and
wait for the Senate to do something.
We are in a CR now where there is a
limited amount of time. I understand
this CR will go through December 20,
so for a few more weeks.
It is not a matter of waiting for the
Senate to come to an agreement be-
tween Republicans and Democrats
there. It is a matter of getting the
House and the Senate to get an agree-
ment.
At some point, somebody in the lead-
ership of the House majority is going
to have to go sit down with somebody
in the leadership of the Senate major-
ity. Everybody has their different par-
ties and their different ideas, and they
are going to have to stay in that room
until they get an agreement. It has
happened before. It has to happen this
time. It hasn’t happened yet.
I don’t know if those honest, earnest
negotiations are going on between who-
ever in your House majority is going to
be in the lead position to head that ne-
gotiation and whoever it is on the Sen-
ate side. It might be their appropria-
tions chairs and your appropriations
chairs, whoever has been designated by
the House.
There has to be a commitment that
they are just going to go sit in a room
until they figure out their differences.
We agreed on a number. We passed a bi-
partisan 2-year budget deal for the pur-
pose especially of making sure our
military doesn’t go in limbo, and these
other Federal agencies that are impor-
tant, too, that need to get the agreed
numbers that they can come to an
agreement on to spend.
But, ultimately, we know the cost—
we are hearing the cost from our mili-
tary generals—of the CR. It is probably
$1.5 billion a month that they lose,
that they are not able to properly go
and buy the equipment our troops need
when we are operating under a CR.
I hope we get to that agreement soon
where whoever it is on your side that is
going to be the point person that is au-
thorized to get a deal can go sit down
with the Senate and just stay until
they get that deal.
b 1215
And I know there are a lot of other
things going on over here. We are not
going to get into the impeachment in-
fatuation and what it has taken away
from. I hope it has not taken away
from the ability to get this agreement.
This is something both sides are
going to have to do: House, Senate, Re-
publican, Democrat. Until both sides
get that agreement, we are at an im-
passe. And the most disappointing
thing is, we already agreed on the
budget numbers. That is usually the
big fight.
We had that fight and we had an
agreement. Bipartisan. This is how
much we are going to spend on defense.
This is how much we are going to spend
on nondefense and, yet, even with that
agreement, we can’t get the final bills
brought to the floor. Not partisan bills,
but bipartisan bills that can ultimately
get signed. And so I hope that gets
done soon.
It is both sides that are going to have
to do it: House, Senate, Republican,
Democrat. I would yield to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, the
gentleman talks about a bipartisan
agreement. He does not talk about the
stark fact that the House did its job.
We passed bills. We passed 96 percent of
the funding of the government.
The Senate, led by Republicans, prior
to the end of the fiscal year, passed 0
percent. It is hard to come to an agree-
ment when the Senate doesn’t pass
anything. Nothing. Zero. Mainly be-
cause they needed the President to say:
Simon says.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8903
November 15, 2019
I know that, for a fact—based upon
conversations with the leadership of
the Senate, that the President signing
off, and we know that the Acting Chief
of Staff, when he was here in this body,
voted to shut the government down
and voted against opening up, and said
we ought to have a sequester for this
fiscal year—that that was his position.
It was Mr. Vought’s position as well,
who is the acting director at OMB. A
mirror, Madam Speaker, in my opin-
ion, of the Acting Chief of Staff.
So for the Republican whip to say,
oh, gee whiz, we are wringing our
hands, and we passed partisan bills, of
course we passed partisan bills because
the gentleman’s side would not work
with us on our bills. That was the
strategy, I would suggest, Madam
Speaker, not simply a difference of
opinion.
As a matter of fact, on the defense
spending that the gentleman mentions,
I know for a fact, because I talked to
them on the Republican side in both of
the committees on appropriations and
authorizing, the 733 figure that we used
was an acceptable figure. A figure, by
the way, acceptable to the Joint Chiefs
of Staff. But it is very hard to reach an
agreement if one side doesn’t say any-
thing, doesn’t send any bill, doesn’t
take any action.
There was nothing to negotiate on.
And the gentleman talks about a bill.
First of all, the only thing that was
agreed to was how much money we are
going to spend overall on discretionary
spending, about 30 percent—a little
over 30 percent of the entire budget.
But there was no agreement on the dis-
tribution of those dollars to the var-
ious committees.
Now, the gentleman says so much on
defense side, so much on nondefense
side. The gentleman is correct. But,
very frankly, what the Senate Demo-
crats are concerned about is that they
will be passing bills, and money will be
cut from programs that we feel are
very important, to build a wall, a wall
that somebody bought a $100 saw at
Home Depot and cut a hole in.
So I would reiterate my disappoint-
ment with the total failure of the
United States Senate, led by Repub-
licans, to enact any bill that appro-
priated money for the operations of
government prior to the end of this fis-
cal year.
So I say to my friend, there are peo-
ple meeting. As the gentleman knows,
the Speaker and Mr. Mnuchin had an
agreement. Now, what does that re-
flect? Simon says. Because the Senate
will not act as an independent body,
coequal branch of the Government of
the United States. Mr. MCCONNELL has
said as much. We won’t pass anything
unless the President will sign it, as if
we have no mind of our own; as if—the
Representatives of the American peo-
ple who vote by majority and pass
something or by 60 votes in the Sen-
ate—only one vote counts, the Presi-
dent of the United States.
And I say, I lament that fact, Madam
Speaker. I tell the minority whip that
I regret, and I will tell him—and I hope
he believes me, because I believe it—if
it were a Democratic President, I
would be prepared to vote for bills on
this floor that I believe the American
people would support and that this
body would support.
And if the President signs it. He
signs it. If he doesn’t, then we see if we
have two-thirds under our Constitu-
tion. And if we don’t, the bill does not
become law. That is the way the sys-
tem ought to work. But, no, we are ne-
gotiating with Mr. Mnuchin, not with
the Senate, not with Mr. LEAHY, not
even, apparently, with Senator MCCON-
NELL. We are simply waiting for the
President to tell the Senate: This allo-
cation is okay.
That is why, in my view, they didn’t
pass a single bill before the end of the
fiscal year. But I hope we pass the CR.
I hope it is as clean as it can be. There
are anomalies that have to be taken
care of, and we will take care of those,
things that have to be extended be-
cause they are going to expire on the
21st of the month, this month.
So I hope we do that, and I hope we
can join together in a bipartisan way
to do that. And then I join my friend,
the minority whip, Madam Speaker,
and hope we can get to bipartisan
agreement. There is nobody in this
body that served with me for any
length of time that doesn’t know I
work toward that end, and I will con-
tinue to work toward that end.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, let’s
be clear that we both know the Senate
operates differently than the House.
The Senate has a 60-vote requirement,
which means for the Senate to move
anything, it actually takes Repub-
licans and Democrats to come to an
agreement.
The gentleman can talk about issues
where Republicans are in disagree-
ment. I could surely go through areas
where Democrats are in disagreement;
for example, funding over border secu-
rity, which is a clear sticking point,
one of the holdups in getting an agree-
ment.
We probably have a pretty good
agreement on defense, even though
while the gentleman says the House did
its job, the House’s job is to pass bills
that can ultimately become law to ad-
vance all the things that we agree
upon, and there is a President that is
part of this process.
So like in previous administrations,
when we have these negotiations, of-
tentimes it is not just the House and
Senate. Clearly, we need more serious
agreements and negotiations between
House and Senate leaders to come to
an agreement. But, ultimately, you
also have to produce a bill that the
White House is in agreement with
where they will sign. It doesn’t mean
you take what they want. In fact, the
President is not getting many of the
things he requested. But at some level,
if the President is going to veto a bill,
it is probably worth having negotia-
tions to see if you can get beyond that.
So this would not be the first admin-
istration where the House and Senate
negotiated with the White House. The
gentleman has been in meetings, as I
have been in meetings, with many
Presidents where we negotiate and try
to come to an agreement. It doesn’t
mean they all end up being signed into
law. It might be vetoed.
The President has the power of veto,
so it is worth all of our time to see if,
not only the House and Senate can get
an agreement, but also we can get an
agreement with the White House, too.
This is not the first time that has hap-
pened. Those negotiations are going on,
but the wall is a big sticking point.
We are building a wall. Probably
about $8.5 billion this previous year
was allocated, and we are going to ne-
gotiate what that is going to be next
year. That is part of the negotiation.
And, hopefully, we can come to an
agreement over it. It shouldn’t be that
difficult to do it, but it is one of the
sticking points. There are a number of
sticking points, but as those sticking
points happen, we all acknowledge it
costs us.
It costs our defense. Our Nation’s de-
fense suffers when we operate under
CRs. The CR that is being talked about
currently goes through December 20.
My question to the gentleman is: Cur-
rently, the week of December 16, the
House is scheduled not to be in session.
And that would be the same week that
the CR that is being contemplated
would expire.
Are we planning on coming back into
session that week of December 16 if De-
cember 20 is going to be the expiration
of this current CR that is being nego-
tiated? I yield to the gentleman.
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding.
Madam Speaker, I would advise all
Members on both sides of the aisle not
to schedule any business outside of
Washington, D.C., between the 16th and
the 20th of next month. And I will ad-
vise them further if, in fact, we do not
fund the government by the 20th, they
may well be here longer than that. We
will not leave here without funding the
Government of the United States of
America.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate that update from the gen-
tleman on the schedule. Obviously,
next week we will have a number of
other items. I yield to the gentleman.
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, it is
December 20, not November 20.
Mr. SCALISE. So the week of Decem-
ber 16, you are suggesting we should
keep that open?
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I am
advising all Members to ensure that
their schedules accommodate sessions
between the 16th and the 20th of De-
cember, which was originally, as the
gentleman points out, not scheduled.
But that was on the thought that we
would rationally get past the only bills
we really have to pass, and that is ap-
propriation bills.
By the way, Madam Speaker, the way
that should work is we pass a bill, the

HOUSE
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8904 November 15, 2019
Senate passes a bill, and, yes, they re-
quire 60 votes. Well, what does that
mean? It means they have to come to a
compromise at a higher number.
We didn’t have to do that. We got
some Republican votes for some of the
bills. But the fact is, we did our busi-
ness and, frankly, we did it before—it
has been done since I have been here—
96 percent of the government funded,
and we sent them to the Senate.
The Senate has not considered a sin-
gle one of those bills because they had
no stomach for compromise, which was
why we are negotiating with Mr.
Mnuchin and not the Senate leadership
to listen to what, apparently, the
President will accept.
I agree with the minority whip that
considering the administration’s views
is important because, of course, we
want the bills signed. But we have
known for a very long time that the
Republicans could not—on this floor—
neither Speaker Ryan, nor Speaker
Boehner could negotiate with Mr.
Mulvaney.
The minority whip knows that,
Madam Speaker. As a matter of fact, a
lot of the Republicans have talked to
me, Madam Speaker, about how dif-
ficult Mulvaney is to deal with. But we
waited for checkoff, either from Chief
of Staff Mulvaney or the President
himself. But we waited. Not we in the
House, in the Senate.
So I tell my friend, the Senate was
not prepared to bring their bills, not
our bills, to the floor to try to achieve
that bipartisan agreement of which the
minority whip speaks. Not a single bill
was brought to the floor before the end
of the fiscal year.
You are not going to get any kind of
an agreement if you don’t try to move
forward, if you just wait for what Mr.
Mulvaney wants us to do.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I was
just working with Mr. Mulvaney yes-
terday on USMCA, something I would
hope to see us bring to this House
floor. Clearly, by the end of this year,
it should have been done a long time
ago, but something I know he and
many others in the administration—
Mr. Lighthizer has been taking the
point on trying to get a negotiation
concluded so that we can create more
jobs in this country and create better
trade opportunities for our families
that we represent.
Even if Mr. Mnuchin were to get an
agreement, we all know that Mr.
Mnuchin doesn’t have a vote in the
Senate. And even if every Republican
in the Senate agreed with Mr.
Mnuchin, you still can’t pass a bill in
the Senate because it takes Democrats
working as well.
The families that we represent are
much less concerned about whose side
thinks they are right, as they are
about saying, just go in a room and
work it out. It has been done before. It
ought to be done this time. And I
would just encourage that between now
and December 20—we don’t have to
wait until December 16—I would hope
that those leaders on your side in the
majority would go get with the leaders
in the Senate and come to an agree-
ment.
I am sure they will have conversa-
tions along the way with the White
House, too, but at a minimum, to get
the House and Senate to come to agree-
ment, not complain about who passed
bills and who didn’t.
The NDAA was passed here in par-
tisan way. It never had happened be-
fore in the history of Congress. The
gentleman’s side chose to do a partisan
bill where there was a bipartisan bill to
be had, and, yet, that was put on the
side.
b 1230
So there is a bipartisan way to do it
or a partisan way to do it. Ultimately,
you are in the majority; you get to de-
cide that.
The Senate has their own different
set of rules, and we might want to
change them, but that is how they op-
erate.
At the end of the day, both sides have
to get in a room and work it out, and
I would just encourage both sides to do
that.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland.
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I
thank the gentleman for yielding. I
just make one additional comment.
It is ironic that the minority whip,
Madam Speaker, addresses such great
concern about funding the Armed
Forces of the United States. We passed
a bill at a figure that the Joint Chiefs
of Staff thought was a figure that was
acceptable and supportive of our na-
tional security, and almost every Re-
publican—maybe every one—
Mr. SCALISE. Every Republican.
Mr. HOYER.—voted against it.
Mr. SCALISE. Because it had poison
pills in it. The level of funding wasn’t
the issue. It was the limitations on the
Defense Department to be able to do
their job properly that were added in,
when everyone knew those were par-
tisan additions that had never been in
previous bills.
So we can get it done without par-
tisan bills. If you want to do the par-
tisan poison pills, it is your preroga-
tive, but it is not going to get signed
into law. Our job should be to make
law and to put the differences on the
side and work through and get it done.
It has always been done before, by
the way. NDAA has never been a par-
tisan bill until this year.
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman.
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I would
say that is not accurate.
But having said that, we hope we can
move forward. But to absolve the
United States Senate, led by Repub-
licans, have a majority of Republicans
controlling the Senate Committee on
Appropriations and controlling what
goes on the floor—Democrats don’t
control that; the Republicans control
it—they didn’t bring a single appro-
priations bill to the floor.
Now, if you don’t like our ideas, put
your ideas on the floor. Have them
voted up or down. If they lose, then you
either have to get a compromise or you
don’t get a bill passed.
I will leave it to the American public,
Madam Speaker, to determine who is
being partisan on this issue and who is
not.
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker,
again, we know the rules of the Senate.
They operate differently. We might
both agree that we would do things dif-
ferently. We do things differently in
the House than they do. Ultimately,
both sides have to come to an agree-
ment, and, hopefully, that happens in
the next few weeks, not at the mid-
night hour by December 20.

EAGLE SCOUT WILLIAM MCLEES
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker,
today, I would like to commend Wil-
liam McLees of south Jersey on achiev-
ing the admirable rank of Eagle Scout.
William led his fellow boy scouts of
Troop 79 in his Eagle Scout project to
install an information kiosk at Somers
Mansion. This information booth will
educate visitors about the past of this
old historic building, which is one of
the oldest buildings in the region, dat-
ing back to 1725.
McLees carefully outfitted the kiosk
with solar panels for lighting and a wa-
terproof exterior so the structure will
now be as long-lasting as Somers Man-
sion itself.
Madam Speaker, I applaud William’s
craftsmanship and his leadership in co-
ordinating this project, and I thank
him for this informative addition to
our entire south Jersey community. I
congratulate him on his high title of
Eagle Scout, and I wish him the very
best.
Americans look for heroes all over
the world. Our hero is William McLees.
He truly deserves our praise.

minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the city of Murray,
Kentucky, home of Murray State Uni-
versity, for its recent distinction as
one of the top 50 safest college towns in
America. Murray is a beacon of edu-
cational excellence and is an invalu-
able asset to the First Congressional
District of Kentucky.
Through analysis of violent crime
rates across the Nation, SafeWise, a
safety-focused consumer research firm,
found that Murray exhibited exception-
ally low crime rates. This finding fur-
ther highlights an already notable
community in my district.
I applaud the work Murray has done
to achieve this recognition and com-
mend Murray State University on the
collegial environment it has developed
for its more than 8,000 students. When
students come to Murray State, they
not only join the academic community,
but they also become citizens of the en-
tire Murray family.
Once again, I congratulate the resi-
dents and leaders of Murray on this
award and urge them to continue their
tradition of excellence.
f
GUN VIOLENCE PROTECTION AND
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker,
the shooting in Santa Clarita yester-
day marks the 365th mass shooting this
year. At least one of those shootings
rocked my own community.
Today is exactly 9 months since the
senseless workplace shooting in Au-
rora, Illinois, that took the lives of
Trevor Wehner, Clayton Parks, Russell
Beyer, Vicente Juarez, and Josh
Pinkard. Some of the heroic police offi-
cers who responded to that shooting
just returned to full duty this week.
This does not have to be the norm.
This year, the House passed bipartisan
legislation that would save lives by im-
plementing universal background
checks for every gun purchased. The
Senate needs to pass it and to send it
to the President.
And we should do more still. I sup-
port legislation that would prevent gun
violence by: one, committing Federal
funds to study it for the public health
crisis that it is; two, keeping guns out
of the hands of known domestic abus-
ers; and, three, just this week, I co-
sponsored the Assault Weapons Ban of
2019, because weapons of war do not be-
long in our neighborhoods.
These are commonsense policies that
would save countless lives: children’s
lives, first responders’ lives, our own
neighbors’ lives.
f
TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT JOSEPH
RICHARD III
(Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute and to revise
and extend his remarks.)
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to
Sergeant Joseph Richard III, a Lou-
isiana native who gave his life fighting
for our country during a third tour in
Iraq in his 5 years of U.S. military
service.
Sergeant Richard was deeply devoted
to his family and his country. He was a
loving husband, son, brother, and uncle
who dedicated much of his life to en-
suring his loved ones—and every single
one of us—were able to enjoy the many
freedoms we too often take for granted.
Sergeant Richard was the recipient
of 12 distinguished service medals, in-
cluding the Bronze Star and the Purple
Heart.
He made the ultimate sacrifice on
the battlefield fighting against one of
our Nation’s fiercest enemies, and, for
that, he will never be forgotten.
In fact, his parents, Joe and Elaine
Richard, were both here in D.C. with us
last week to memorialize forever their
son’s sacrifice in the Library of Con-
gress’ Veterans History Project.
I take this moment to extend my sin-
cerest and deepest appreciation to
them and the countless others whose
lives were blessed by Sergeant Richard.
No one understands the true life of
freedom more deeply.
I pray that God’s grace continues to
comfort them, and I thank them for
their service and sacrifices over the
many years. We know our soldiers
don’t serve alone.
Mr. and Mrs. Richard, thank you for
raising a hero. We will also work hard
here in Congress to honor your sac-
rifice and the sacrifices all of our sol-
diers make.
f
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
(Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute.)
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker,
over 7 million American men, women,
and children depend on insulin to keep
themselves alive; but, between 2012 and
2016, the price of insulin nearly dou-
bled, forcing many of these Americans
to ration this lifesaving drug.
It is unacceptable.
What we hear over and over again
from big pharmaceutical companies is
that these price hikes are necessary to
pay for new research. But insulin isn’t
new. The first patent for insulin came
out in 1923—almost 100 years ago.
The simple truth is that the drug
companies keep hiking their prices on
us because they can get away with it.
As a result, Americans are made to suf-
fer and make impossible sacrifices
while the same drugs get sold in for-
eign countries for much cheaper.
That is why I am proud to support
the Lower Drug Costs Now Act, smart
legislation which would allow Medicare
to negotiate lower drug prices for
American citizens.
TAMAQUA FOOTBALL AND PENN
STATE SCHUYLKILL CROSS-
COUNTRY
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize several impressive
athletic accomplishments that have re-
cently taken place in Pennsylvania’s
Ninth Congressional District.
Last Friday night, Tamaqua football
made history as they secured their
first-ever district championship. After
coming close to winning the champion-
ship for the past several seasons, I ap-
plaud the team’s resilience and grit.
But football isn’t the only sport to
talk about in the Ninth Congressional
District these days. For the third con-
secutive year, Penn State Schuylkill
women’s cross-country team took
home the conference title at the Penn-
sylvania State University Athletic
Conference Championships. This is the
first time Penn State Schuylkill has
achieved a three-peat. They are truly a
sports dynasty.
Congratulations to both Sam Bonner,
head football coach at Tamaqua High
School, and Joe Muldowney, head
cross-country coach at Penn State
Schuylkill, for leading their teams to
victory.
Perseverance and dedication are de-
fining characteristics of Pennsylva-
nians. I am incredibly proud of the
Tamaqua football and Penn State
Schuylkill women’s cross-country
teams for these accomplishments.
And always, I am very honored to
represent the great Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania’s Ninth Congressional
District.

SANTA CLARITA
(Mr. LEVIN of California asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to address yet an-
other tragic school shooting. Yester-
day, a gunman killed two students and
wounded three others in Santa Clarita,
California.
While we continue to gather the facts
and pray for everyone in that Cali-
fornia community, we must also con-
tinue to fight for action on gun vio-
lence.
It has been 261 days since the House
passed the Bipartisan Background
Checks Act. That bill is buried in
MITCH MCCONNELL’s legislative grave-
yard. In that time, at least 320 mass
shootings have occurred.
While I don’t expect Senate Repub-
licans to agree with every word of
every bill that we pass here in the
House, I do expect them to do their job.
They need to hold hearings. They need
to have a vote.
The American people deserve better.

IN MEMORY OF BRETT WILSON
(Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Madam
Speaker, on November 2, 2019, the com-
munities of Olmsted Falls and Colum-
bia Township of northeast Ohio
mourned the loss of firefighter Brett
Wilson.
Brett was off duty the morning of Oc-
tober 27 when a car struck a nearby
utility pole, causing power lines to fall
onto the roadway. Brett and his
girlfriend, without hesitation, ran to
help the victims of the accident.
Brett was electrocuted after coming
into contact with the electrified
ground near the accident and passed
away immediately. Both his girlfriend
and the driver were injured but, luck-
ily, survived.
Our community honored Brett’s her-
oism and life on Saturday, November 2,
with a funeral procession held in his
honor. Unsurprisingly, the community
lined the streets, waving American
flags and holding their hands over their
hearts to honor the 2015 Olmsted Falls
High School graduate.
We are heartbroken by the loss of the
Olmsted Falls resident and Columbia
Township firefighter, Brett Wilson.
Brett, the son of an Olmsted Township
police officer, was a true hero and pub-
lic safety servant.
Brett will be deeply missed by his
friends, family, and the community.
We thank him and his family for their
service, and we keep them in our pray-
ers.

RECOGNIZING CIVIL RIGHTS
LEADER CLAUDETTE COLVIN
(Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ asked and was
given permission to address the House
for 1 minute and to revise and extend
her remarks.)
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize
Claudette Colvin, a Parkchester resi-
dent and American civil rights pioneer
who, on March 2, 1955, at the age of 15
years old, was arrested in Montgomery,
Alabama, for refusing to give up her
seat to a young passenger, becoming
one of the many to be arrested for chal-
lenging Montgomery’s bus segregation
policies.
Nine months after Claudette Colvin,
Rosa Parks was famously arrested for a
similar act of civil nonviolence.
Claudette’s heroic story was nearly
forgotten by history. Her actions led to
monumental progress in our Nation’s
history. Not only that, her heroic ac-
tions amplified and set the stage for
other great African American civil
rights leaders and their actions.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues
to join me in recognizing Ms. Claudette
Colvin’s courage to stand in the face of
injustice and demand recognition of
her inalienable rights. Because, in her
courage to fight for her freedom, she
paved a path for millions of others to
do the same.

WE MUST NEVER FORGET
LESSONS OF THE PAST
(Mr. BACON asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, in an
anti-Semitic attack this last week,
cowards desecrated over 75 headstones
of the Temple Israel Cemetery in
Omaha. Countless headstones were
pushed from their bases, with many
broken in the process. It is vile. It is
reprehensible. It is disgusting.
This hateful action toward the Jew-
ish community causes great pain in my
heart. As Rabbi Abraham of Beth El
Synagogue in Omaha recently re-
minded us, cemeteries are one of the
most holy places, and the Talmud
teaches us that ‘‘gravestones are fairer
than royal palaces.’’
This attack happened around Vet-
erans Day, which provided a dark re-
minder that the cause of defending
freedom and combating hate never
rests.
On that note, I call upon the leader-
ship of Congress to move H.R. 943, the
Never Again Education Act by Con-
gresswoman CAROLYN MALONEY.
Education is a powerful weapon com-
bating anti-Semitism, and this bill will
provide valuable tools in that fight.
As we near the 75th anniversary of
the end of World War II, one of the
darkest chapters in human history, we
must never forget the lessons of the
past so that we never again repeat
those horrors in the future.
f
PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICING
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker,
every day I hear from constituents who
are going broke trying to pay for their
prescriptions, and more often than not
they are seniors—seniors like Cheryl,
who often has to decide whether to
forgo one of her monthly medications
or to pay a $600 pharmacy bill.
Stories like Cheryl’s are becoming
both all too common and unacceptable.
We are committed to lowering the
cost of prescription drugs so that
Americans can afford their lifesaving
medications.
That is why I have introduced legis-
lation to eliminate some of the bar-
riers that seniors and people with dis-
abilities have to getting the medica-
tions they need.
The Better Tools to Lower Costs Act,
which has been included in H.R. 3,
would eliminate the asset requirement
for CMS’s Extra Help program.
As a result, low-income Medicare re-
cipients with modest retirement sav-
ings or a small rainy-day fund would
get help to pay for deductibles, pre-
miums, and copays.
Families should not have to drain
their life savings or sell their homes to
afford lifesaving medication. Common-
sense solutions like this and others in
H.R. 3 will address the prescription
drug crisis, and I look forward to vot-
ing for it.

RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF OKLAHOMA INTER-
COLLEGIATE LEGISLATURE
(Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend her remarks.)
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.
Madam Speaker, today I rise to recog-
nize the 50th anniversary of the Okla-
homa Intercollegiate Legislature, a
student run and led mock-government
organization.
OIL has brought together thousands
of young people from every corner of
my State to learn how to effect change
and to make their voices heard in our
democracy.
OIL replicates every part of Okla-
homa’s State government, from our
legislative branch to the Governor’s of-
fice to the judiciary.
The college students who participate
in this program draft their own legisla-
tion, build lifelong and often bipartisan
friendships, and learn what it takes to
move an idea from concept to reality.
They learn how to craft policy, nego-
tiate and compromise, and how to lead.
I know because, as a young college
student, I was a member of OIL and
learned these lessons myself, as have so
many of Oklahoma’s current leaders in
government, civic, and business com-
munities.
So, today, please join me in cele-
brating OIL’s 50th anniversary and the
impact it has and will have on Okla-
homa’s students and future leaders.

NATIONAL RECYCLING DAY
(Ms. SCHRIER asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.)
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker,
today is National Recycling Day.
As a Nation and world, we are accu-
mulating single-use plastics at an
alarming rate. By 2050, there will be
more plastic than fish in the world’s
oceans.
This is why recycling is critical, and
we need more education for all of us
about how best to recycle.
We also need help from industry to
either avoid plastic altogether or pack-
age their goods with the most desirable
and recyclable types of plastic.
As consumers, though, our standard
should be ‘‘Made from 100 percent recy-
cled materials’’ and not ‘‘Made from re-
cyclable materials.’’ There is a vast
difference.
We all know the three Rs: reduce,
reuse, recycle. But we can’t just recy-
cle. That is the third choice. Our top

priorities should be reducing and
reusing.
So what can we do? We can start by
making good personal choices, and here
is an easy one: Don’t use plastic uten-
sils.
More than 100 million plastic utensils
are used and thrown away into landfills
every day across the country. They
can’t be recycled.
We can think twice about whether we
really need our water to come in plas-
tic bottles. There are far better
choices.
And for Democrats, the party that
commits to careful environmental
stewardship, we absolutely, positively
must lead by example.
Madam Speaker, in the coming
months I will be reaching out to my
colleagues to take action on this issue.
Happy recycling day.

HONORING BERNARD TYSON
HON. NANCY PELOSI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 15, 2019
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise today
with my colleague, Congresswoman BARBARA
LEE, to honor the life and legacy of Mr. Ber-
nard Tyson, a devoted husband, father, and
health advocate. His passing is a great loss
for our country and all those committed to
quality, affordable health care, as well as a
deeply personal loss for all of those who were
privileged to call him a friend. We extend our
deepest condolences to his wife, Denise Brad-
ley-Tyson, his three sons, Bernard Jr., Alex-
ander, and Charles, and the Kaiser
Permanente family on their loss.
Bernard Tyson was a proud son of the Bay
Area who embodied our city’s values of equal-
ity and opportunity for all. Born in Vallejo, Cali-
fornia, on January 20, 1959, Mr. Tyson was
one of seven children of Billie and Moses
Tyson. He spent his formative years in Vallejo,
CA, where he graduated from Vallejo High
School with the class of 1977. Mr. Tyson and
his family spent much time in and out of hos-
pitals with his mother, who had diabetes.
These visits helped shape and develop his in-
terest in the field of medicine, and inspired
within him a dream of running his own hospital
one day.
After graduating from high school, Mr.
Tyson attended Golden Gate University in San
Francisco, California. While in university, he
worked as an administrative analyst for Vallejo
General Hospital. In 1982, he earned his
Bachelor’s Degree in Health Service Manage-
ment and in 1984, he earned his Master of
Business Administration from Golden Gate
University.
Mr. Tyson spent much of his professional
career at Kaiser Permanente, which he loved.
He joined the company in 1987 as an Assist-
ant Administrator. In 1992, he was appointed
CEO of the Kaiser Foundation Hospital in
Santa Rosa. From 1993 to 1999, he held the
positions of Vice President, Senior Vice Presi-
dent (SVP), and Central East Division presi-
dent for Kaiser Permanente. From 1999 to
2006, he was the SVP, Chief Operating Offi-
cer for regions outside California, and SVP of
brand strategy. From 2006 to 2010, he served
as the Executive VP of Health Plan and Hos-
pital Operations. From 2010 to 2013, he was
President and COO of Kaiser Permanente.
From 2013 to 2014, he was promoted to CEO
and from 2014 to 2019, he had been Chair-
man and CEO.
To say that Mr. Tyson knew the interworking
of the Kaiser would be an understatement. He
worked his way to the top one step at a time,
mastering all he could along the way. Mr.
Tyson’s innovative, pioneering and effective
leadership was recognized by many. In 2017,
Mr. Tyson was named one of Time’s 100 most
influential people.
As one of our nation’s most prominent Afri-
can American CEOs and health care leaders,
Mr. Tyson blazed a trail for countless other
health care advocates and leaders of color to
bring their vision, values and expertise to im-
proving the health and well-being of our com-
munities. While he made his mark as a leader
of the health care community, his reach ex-
tended to every part of our Bay Area commu-
nity: to the arts, education, sports, and local
activism. He brought a commitment to diver-
sity and inclusion to everything he did, from
the grassroots to the corporate suite. His
bright smile encouraged others to participate.
He gave people hope.
From when we first met Mr. Tyson, his vi-
sionary approach to health care stood out. His
passionate advocacy for the Affordable Care
Act helped protect and strengthen this land-
mark legislation, ensuring that every family, in
every community had access to the care they
needed to grow and thrive. For his many con-
tributions to the health of families and the
strength of our nation, we are deeply grateful.
Today, on behalf of California’s 12th Con-
gressional District, I join Congresswoman LEE
in celebrating Bernard Tyson’s impactful life
and legacy. May it be a comfort to Denise,
Bernard Jr., Alexander, and Charles that so
many mourn with and pray for them during
this sad time. May Bernard rest in power and
in peace.

CELEBRATING THE 95TH
BIRTHDAY OF PHYLLIS LYON
HON. NANCY PELOSI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 15, 2019
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise with
joy to recognize an icon of San Francisco, a
trailblazer in the fight for civil rights and a dear
friend, Phyllis Lyon, who recently celebrated
her 95th birthday.
Beginning in the 1950s, Phyllis and her late
wife, Del Martin, were on the vanguard in the
fight to make real the promise of equality for
LGBTQ Americans, forming our nation’s first
lesbian civil rights organization, Daughter of
Bilitis, and establishing the first nationally dis-
tributed lesbian newsletter, the Ladder. They
worked tirelessly to ensure that every woman
could live without fear of violence or persecu-
tion.
As a journalist, community organizer and
clarion voice for justice and equality, Phyllis
has dedicated her entire life to uniting diverse
communities to create fundamental change.
From working to decriminalize homosexuality,
successfully advocating to outlaw employment
discrimination in San Francisco and ensuring
that our city respected the dignity of everyone,
Phyllis’s work has had a powerful impact that
has strengthened our communities and our
democracy.
For 40 years, the Lyon-Martin Health Serv-
ices, named in honor of their dedication to the
health and well-being of all women, has been
a model for community-based health care that
provides lifesaving services, case manage-
ment and care for women of every age, race,
disability, socio-economic condition and sexual
orientation. Phyllis’ unwavering commitment to
caring for our most vulnerable continued as
my appointee to the 1995 White House Con-
ference on Aging, where she was a strong
voice for the rights of lesbian seniors and all
women.
Phyllis and Del’s relationship and service to
our community has been a source of inspira-
tion to me and all who are fortunate enough
to know them. In 1996, during the Floor de-
bate on the so-called Defense of Marriage Act,
I was privileged to display their picture, asking
my colleagues, ‘‘If you knew Phyllis and Del
. . . why would you not want them to be treat-
ed equally?’’ This year, I once again recog-
nized them on the House Floor as we voted
to pass the landmark Equality Act to finally,
fully end discrimination against LGBTQ individ-
uals and guarantee the civil rights of all Ameri-
cans, regardless of who they are or whom the
love.
Phyllis and Del’s marriage in 2004, the first
same-sex wedding to be recognized in San
Francisco, was a joyous celebration. When the
California Supreme Court voided their mar-
riage, they recommitted to the fight for equality
until the decision was finally overturned in
2008, when they became the first LGBTQ cou-
ple to be legally married in California.
While Del sadly passed away a few months
later, Phyllis continues to be a blessing to our
community, using her vision, values and voice
to build a brighter future for San Franciscans
and all Americans. On behalf of the House of
Representatives, it is a pleasure to wish Phyl-
lis Lyon a happy 95th birthday and a year
filled with peace, love and joy.

RECOGNIZING MELVIN MATHIAS
ON HIS 90TH BIRTHDAY
HON. BRADLEY SCOTT SCHNEIDER
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 15, 2019
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Mr. Melvin Mathias, a resi-
dent of Illinois who will celebrate his 90th
birthday on November 23rd. I came to know
Melvin’s story through his cousin and my
friend, Sidney Mathias of Buffalo Grove, and I
wish to share it today because it embodies so
much of the opportunity, perseverance, and
immigrant heritage that makes our nation spe-
cial.
Mr. Mathias was born in Fulda, Germany, to
Erich and Kathinka in 1929. A Holocaust sur-
vivor, he immigrated to the United States in
October 1936 with his parents and maternal
grandparents, to escape religious persecution
by the Nazis.
Mr. Mathias and his family eventually settled
on Chicago’s South Side. He became a United
States citizen on July 7, 1943. In 1951, he
was drafted into the U.S. Army and served in

the Korean War until 1953. After he was dis-
charged from the military, he began working
for his uncle Ernest at Quality Sheet Metal
Works. He worked hard at the company and
eventually became the co-owner with his
cousin Sidney. He led the company until it
closed in 1992.
Mr. Mathias built his first house in Chicago
after marrying Joanne Decker in 1955. Soon
after, they had two children, Linda and Larry.
The family relocated to Homewood in 1970,
where Joanne passed away in 1990. Mr. Ma-
thias later remarried Adrienne Cohen in 1993,
and the couple remained together until her
passing in 2012.
Presently, Mr. Mathias is active and en-
gaged member of his local community. He is
involved in several veterans groups including
the Homewood VFW 807 and the Pvt. Sam
Veivelt Post of the Jewish War Veterans of
America, where he serves as Quartermaster
and Corresponding Secretary. In recognition of
his service in the Korean War, he participated
in the Chicago Honor Flight in 2016 to visit the
Memorial in Washington, D.C. He also enjoys
traveling and spending time with family.
I heartily congratulate Mr. Mathias on his
90th birthday, and thank him for his service to
our community and nation.

SERVICE-DISABLED VETERANS
SMALL BUSINESS CONTINUATION
ACT
SPEECH OF
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, November 13, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in
strong support of H.R. 499, the ‘‘Service-Dis-
abled Veterans Small Business Continuation
Act.’’
H.R. 499 amends the Small Business Act to
clarify the treatment of surviving spouses for
purposes of the service-disabled veteran-
owned small business definition.
This act will provide the surviving spouse of
a service-disabled veteran with federal con-
tracting preference as a Service-Disabled Vet-
eran Owned Small Business with the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Small
Business Administration (SBA).
On Monday we celebrated Veterans Day to
show our veterans and military families how
important they are to us and how grateful we
are for them each and every day.
I offer my deepest gratitude to our nation’s
troops and reservists, their families, and the
21.6 million veterans, including 29,126 here in
the 18th Congressional District. 21.6 million
brave men and women are veterans of our na-
tion’s military service.
This includes more than 2 million women,
2.7 million African American men and women,
1.5 million Hispanic men and women, 342,000
Asian American Pacific Islanders, and 178,000
American Indians.
The memory of the fallen are never forgot-
ten.
Each Veterans Day, Americans come to-
gether to remember those who have served
our country around the world in the name of
freedom and democracy.
The debt that we owe to them is immeas-
urable.
Their sacrifices, and those of their families,
are freedom’s foundation.
This bill will help veteran families by extend-
ing additional benefits to the surviving spouses
of deceased veterans across the country, in-
cluding at home in Harris County.
By allowing the spouses of deceased serv-
ice-disabled veterans to retain their status as
a Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small
Business, they will remain competitive in the
federal contracting market.
After the years of service their family mem-
bers provide to our country in support of their
loved ones who severve the military, veterans’
spouses have earned the reliability this bill
provides to them and their businesses.
Current law allows surviving spouses of 100
percent service-disabled veteran business
owners to continue receiving preferences for
contracts with the VA, but the benefit does not
extend to the spouses of veterans with a dis-
ability less than 100 percent.
The bipartisan bill introduced today will ex-
tend the benefit to these spouses for three
years, helping ensure their businesses are not
upended after the death of their veteran
spouse.
I thank my colleague, Congressmen CHABOT
for sponsoring this legislation to support fami-
lies of Veterans who so bravely supported the
freedoms of the United States.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join
me in supporting H.R. 499 to amend the Small
Business Act to clarify the treatment of sur-
viving spouses for purposes of the service-dis-
abled veteran-owned small business definition.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DOCTOR
BILL NOBLE
HON. DAVID B. McKINLEY
OF WEST VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 15, 2019
Mr. MCKINLEY. Madam Speaker, last week,
Wheeling lost a compassionate doctor and an
all-around good man. So, I rise today to honor
the life of Dr. Bill Noble of Wheeling, West Vir-
ginia. Bill was a beloved husband, father,
grandfather, friend, teacher and cardiologist.
My wife, Mary, a nurse, worked with Bill for
many years at Ohio Valley Medical Center
where he not only served as chief of cardi-
ology, but was also a dedicated teacher. He
was recognized as teacher of the year several
times by the medical residents, but his great-
est passion was for his work as a cardiologist.
Bill touched the lives of thousands in the area
and our thoughts and prayers are with his wife
Dawn, his two children and his extended fam-
ily as they mourn his passing. He will be
missed.

RECOGNIZING STEVE FARUS AND
HIS 40 YEARS OF SERVICE TO
THE DUNCAN FALLS FIRE DE-
PARTMENT
HON. TROY BALDERSON
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 15, 2019
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Duncan Falls Fire Depart-
ment’s 1st Assistant Chief, Steve Farus, for
the forty years he has dedicated to Wayne
Township and the surrounding area.
Assistant Chief Farus’s career, now span-
ning more than four decades, exemplifies a
selfless commitment to public service. After
graduating from Philo High School in 1971,
Steve joined the U.S. Navy, where he served
honorably for four years. Upon his return to ci-
vilian life, Assistant Chief Farus graduated
from college and joined the Duncan Falls Vol-
unteer Fire Department. In this role, Steve has
continually gone above and beyond his call of
duty. His dedication has manifested itself in
numerous ways, including in his co-founding
of Duncan Falls Safety Town—an educational
program through which he has delivered
countless safety demonstrations to school,
church, and other civic groups across the
Wayne community.
In addition, Steve is a long-serving member
of the Muskingum County Firefighters Associa-
tion, where he was instrumental in acquiring a
Fire Safety Trailer for the Duncan Falls Fire
Department. Today, the trailer is used for chil-
dren’s safety demonstrations and is a favorite
stop on the many station tours that Steve co-
ordinates for members of the community. For
his remarkable service, Assistant Chief Farus
has been honored with several awards, includ-
ing the Zanesville Sertoma Service to Mankind
Award and the Gardner Insurance Community
Protector Award.
Beyond his work with the Fire Department,
Steve has further served Wayne Township as
the owner and operator of the Clyde Thomp-
son Funeral home since 1985. He and his
wife, DuAnne, are the proud parents of Scott,
Matthew, and Stacey, and now have 6 grand-
children.
As family, friends, and Wayne Township
gather to recognize Steve’s outstanding ca-
reer, I salute him for his commitment to advo-
cating for safety and for his ongoing service
above self. Assistant Chief Farus can take
great pride in all he has accomplished and the
positive impact that his work has had and will
continue to have.
I thank Steve for his devotion to bettering
Wayne Township, Ohio, and in turn, I honor
him for his incredible record of achievement.

HONORING AMBASSADOR JOHN

HON. DAVID E. PRICE
OF NORTH CAROLINA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 15, 2019
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ambas-
sador John O’Keefe, who is retiring after a dis-
tinguished diplomatic and public service career
including, most recently, eleven years at the
helm of the Open World Leadership Center at
the Library of Congress.
Open World is a unique exchange program
for emerging democracies, particularly former
Soviet and communist states. This program
leverages the energy of Members of Congress
and their constituents, bringing current and ris-
ing foreign leaders to Washington and other
communities throughout our country for dia-
logue and cultural exposure. Open World now
maintains a vast network of more than 29,000
alumni.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1451
November 15, 2019
As a member of Open World’s Board of
Trustees, I have seen firsthand the impact of
Ambassador O’Keefe’s visionary leadership.
As Chairman of the House Democracy Part-
nership, I have worked with him to increase
the synergy between our two programs, great-
ly increasing the number of Parliamentarians
with whom we can interact.
Under Ambassador O’Keefe’s leadership,
Open World expanded to seventeen countries
and created direct agreements with fourteen
American embassies in Open World program
countries, thus strengthening the United
States legislative branch’s relationship with
U.S. missions abroad. Open World also ex-
panded programming to bring Members of
Parliament from Central Asia to the United
States by virtue of Ambassador O’Keefe’s
knowledge of the region.
John O’Keefe became ambassador to the
Kyrgyz Republic in 2000. As Ambassador, he
made lasting contributions to the country and
the region. He negotiated the treaty that es-
tablished a military base in Kyrgyzstan that
could be used by Coalition forces in support of
operations in Afghanistan. He worked with the
President of Kyrgyzstan to establish an invest-
ment advisory council to attract foreign capital
to the country, and he worked with the Min-
ister of Education to ensure merit-based uni-
versity acceptance for students. Ambassador
O’Keefe also helped to create an outreach
program to the Kyrgyz Muslim community.
After serving as Ambassador, Mr. O’Keefe
returned to the State Department, where he
served as Deputy Assistant Secretary for the
Office of the Director General, Bureau of
Human Resources, and head of the Office of
Career Development and Assignments. He
served as Acting Director General in 2006 and
then as Deputy Director of the Foreign Service
Institute of the Department.
Ambassador O’Keefe’s commitment to diplo-
macy earned him many awards and accolades
for his service throughout his career at the
State Department, including the Distinguished
Honor A ward and the Presidential Perform-
ance Award. He was later recognized with the
prestigious Replogle Award for Management
Improvement, the Presidential Meritorious
Service Award, and the Secretary of State
Award for Lifetime Achievement.
Madam Speaker, I am privileged to know
John O’Keefe as an exemplar of our country’s
values, an accomplished diplomat, and a val-
ued partner in many endeavors. I ask my col-
leagues to join me in honoring him for his long
and dedicated service to the State Depart-
ment, to the Open World Leadership Center,
and to our country.

IN HONOR OF THE EXTRAOR-
DINARY LEGACY OF MALCOLM
THOMAS
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 15, 2019
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor the remarkable legacy of
Malcolm Thomas, a selfless community serv-
ant and business leader, whose many con-
tributions to the state of Alabama have served
to uplift the state socially and economically.
From his impressive career as CEO of his
own engineering service firm, to his support
for historically black colleges and universities
(HBCUs), to his exemplary leadership as Ex-
alted Ruler of R.E. Nelms Elk Lodge No. 977,
Malcolm Thomas has spent much of his life in
the pursuit of success and excellence, not
only for himself, but for the greater community.
Born in Selma, Alabama to the late Rev-
erend George Thomas and the late Mrs. Lovie
Thomas, Malcolm Thomas was taught the im-
portance of high-quality education from an
early age. He attended college at Alabama
A&M University in Huntsville, Alabama, where
he earned his bachelor of science degree in
business administration. It was during his time
at Alabama A&M that two lifelong interests
were sparked, in business and in the preser-
vation and continued vitality of HBCUs.
Founded in 1875 by a former slave, Dr. Wil-
liam Hooper Councill, Alabama A&M is a
proud member of the HBCU system. As a stu-
dent there, Mr. Thomas saw first-hand the im-
portance of ensuring that A&M and other insti-
tutions like it, historically established for the
African American community who had been
barred entry to traditionally white institutions,
be fully funded, providing students with top tier
professors and facilities. Mr. Thomas’ commit-
ment to ensuring the continued vitality of
HBCUs was recognized by Governor Riley,
who asked Mr. Thomas to serve on the Gov-
ernor’s Commission on Historically Black Col-
leges and Universities between 2003 and
2008.
After graduating from Alabama A&M, Mr.
Thomas worked in several corporate positions
before becoming the owner and CEO of
Malcom Thomas Industries, a certified engi-
neering services firm. Now semi-retired, Mr.
Thomas has extensive expertise in marketing,
negotiating and event planning. Today, he
works part-time as an event planner, based in
Huntsville, Alabama.
A selfless community servant, Mr. Thomas
boasts membership (past and present) to
countless boards and charitable organizations,
including the Huntsville Housing Authority
Board of Appeals, the North Alabama Sickle
Cell Board of Directors and the Vocational
Education Advisory Council for Huntsville City
Schools. He was formerly Chairman of the En-
gineering Technology Advisory Committee at
Alabama A&M, a founding board member of
the Alabama A&M University Foundation and
a charter member of 100 Black Men of Hunts-
ville. Politically active, Mr. Thomas served on
the Executive Committee of the Madison
County Republican Men’s Club and on Presi-
dent George H.W. Bush’s Personal Advisory
Committee. Further, he claimed membership
to the Black Americans for President George
H.W. Bush Committee of 100.
Mr. Thomas has been a member of the fra-
ternal organization the Improved Benevolent
Protective Order of the Elks since June 17,
1957. Mr. Thomas has held many positions
within the organization, including serving as
state photographer, Chairman of the State
Nominating Committee, First Vice President of
the Alabama Association of the Improved Be-
nevolent Protective Order of the Elks of the
World and ultimately State President. Mr.
Thomas served as President for twelve years,
during which time the organization introduced
a state choir, the Past State President degree
and a golf tournament. He has been further
recognized as an Esteemed Lecturing Knight,
a trustee and Exalted Ruler of R.E. Nelms
Elks Lodge No. 977. His tenure as Exalted
Ruler spanned 1983 through 2008 and 2009
through 2019, during which time the Lodge
gave money to the Boys and Girls Club, the
Harris Home for Children and Homeless Per-
sons and the Boy Scouts of America, in addi-
tion to providing scholarships for students at
Alabama A&M. Mr. Thomas is also a member
of Alpha Kappa Alpha Fraternity Inc., Delta
Theta Lambda Chapter.
A man of steadfast faith, Mr. Thomas has
been a dedicated member of Phillips Christian
Methodist Episcopal Church where he serves
as Chairman of the Board of Trustees. He is
married to the love of his life, Dr. Mattie Dan-
iels Thomas with whom he shares two chil-
dren, three grandchildren and two great-grand-
children.
On a personal note, I have known ‘‘Uncle
Malcolm’’ all my life and count him as both a
mentor and an extended part of my family. His
business acumen and legendary leadership in
the Elks has been an inspiration to us all. As
a beloved mentor and political advisor, Uncle
Malcolm ensures his legacy in investing in the
hearts and minds of the next generation. I
know that I would not be Alabama’s first Black
Congresswoman without the love, support and
guidance of dear family friends like Uncle Mal-
colm and Auntie Mattie. As you prepare to
succeed from your many years of service to
the R.E. Nelms Elks Lodge No. 977, know that
your work has strengthened the organization
and set a high bar for others to follow.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring the life and great works of Mr.
Malcolm Thomas that has left an indelible im-
print on the Huntsville community and the
State of Alabama.

IN RECOGNITION OF WAYNE
OLIVEIRA
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 15, 2019
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in recognition of the retirement of Mr. Wayne
Oliveira, a veteran of the Fairhaven Fire De-
partment with forty-two years of service.
In 1977 Wayne Oliveira started his career
as a call firefighter. Years later, Wayne would
be appointed a full-time firefighter and EMT by
Fire Chief Donald Bernard. Shortly after his
appointment, Wayne began taking on numer-
ous responsibilities. Wayne was elected sec-
retary of the firefighter’s union, a position he
would hold for the next twenty years. He be-
came a Public Fire Educator in 1989,
prioritizing informing children and seniors
about the importance of fire safety. Developing
the SAFE program, Wayne taught classes in
child car seat installation as well as CPR.
Continuing his outreach efforts. Wayne orga-
nized Public Safety Open Houses for the pub-
lic long before prevention programs became
standard practice.
Wayne was named Standard Times Man of
the Year in 2012 for his wide array of volun-
teer work. From cleaning the traffic island out-
side of the local high school to fundraising for
a new memorial sign which he personally
maintains. Wayne sets an incredible example
of selflessness in the work he takes on. He

IN RECOGNITION OF DENISE
DALRYMPLE FOR A DISTIN-
GUISHED CAREER WITH THE
GIRL SCOUTS OF SOUTH-
EASTERN MICHIGAN
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 15, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to congratulate Denise Dalrymple on her
retirement and recognize her years of distin-
guished service with the Girl Scouts of South-
eastern Michigan. Ms. Dalrymple’s contribu-
tions to the Michigan community are worthy of
commendation.
In 1912, the first Girl Scout troop was estab-
lished in Savannah, Georgia by Juliette Gor-
don Low. She envisioned gathering a group of
women who would empower each other, build
courage, confidence, and character, and al-
ways strive to make the world the better place.
Over a century later, the Girl Scouts continue
to honor their founder’s dutiful vision by offer-
ing girls a chance to cultivate leadership, ex-
perience adventure, and to aspire for success.
Through the Girl Scouts’ wide breadth of pro-
grams, thousands of girls have learned they
are strong, capable, and powerful leaders who
can tackle challenges, solve problems, and
achieve anything they set their minds to.
Since joining the Girl Scouts of South-
eastern Michigan as Chief Executive Officer in
2008, Denise Dalrymple has been instru-
mental in the Girl Scouts’ continued success.
Under her leadership, the organization has
provided its services and programs to over
24,000 girls in eight Michigan counties:
Sanilac, St. Clair, Genesee, Lapeer, Oakland,
Macomb, Wayne, and Monroe. Beloved by
many, Ms. Dalrymple is known amongst her
friends, family, and colleagues as a dedicated,
humble, and effective leader who endeavors
to make everyone’s lives a little brighter. Be-
yond her service in a professional capacity,
Ms. Dalrymple also serves as a role model
who leads by example and inspires thousands
of girls across our community. She has
touched the lives of many and truly embodies
the Girl Scout Promise every day.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring Denise Dalrymple for her
years of service to Girl Scouts of Southeastern
Michigan. We thank her for her outstanding
and impactful work and wish her the best of
luck in all her future endeavors.
IN RECOGNITION OF SWOPE
HEALTH’S FIFTIETH ANNIVER-
SARY
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 15, 2019
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to commemorate Swope Health and
their fifty years of service to the Greater Kan-
sas City metro area. Since they were founded
in 1969, Swope Health has expanded to pro-
vide an extensive number of services to citi-
zens of all backgrounds around the city and
have become an indispensable part of the
Fifth Congressional District of Missouri.
Swope Health opened in 1969 as an inte-
gral part of President Lyndon Johnson’s Model
Cities Program. President Johnson created the
program, as well as its offshoot, the Model Cit-
ies Health Corporations, as a precursor to the
contemporary oversight seen in American cit-
ies. Championing this moment of opportunity,
Swope Health took its mandate seriously. The
first clinic opened by Swope Health operated
in the basement of Metropolitan Missionary
Baptist Church with a total of twenty employ-
ees. These twenty valiant health care profes-
sionals successfully cared for over 2,000 pa-
tients in their first year. Today, the organiza-
tion has grown exponentially, serving over
40,000 patients throughout western Missouri
and eastern Kansas, and their spirit of exem-
plary service and tireless energy persists.
Swope Health operates under an integrated
healthcare model, which means they success-
fully provide a wide range of services for
adults and children, men and women’s health,
and even dental care. The list of specific serv-
ices they provide is extensive and impressive.
To best accomplish this, Swope Health em-
ploys over 500 associates from a diverse
range of professional backgrounds and ca-
reers. Moreover, their dedication to diversity
and inclusion is readily apparent, not only in
the range of employees, but also executives
that are proud to represent Swope Health.
Swope Health’s executive leadership, from
CEO Dave Barber to Community Engagement,
Development & Outreach Coordinator Michelle
Keller, reflect the best and brightest from a
wide range of ethnic and social backgrounds,
all of whom share a dedication to providing
high quality, affordable, and accessible
healthcare.
Furthermore, Swope Health has taken its
role as a community partner seriously by ex-
panding its outpatient offerings around the
city, opening safety-net clinics for low-income
and uninsured Kansas Citians, and hosting
fun, creative, and beneficial events throughout
the year. From Swope Health Socks and
Hops, which encouraged individuals to enjoy
craft beer while supporting the area’s home-
less shelters, to hosting Kansas City’s Na-
tional Health Center Week, Swope Health al-
ways takes their place as a regional leader se-
riously.
Madam Speaker, please join me and the
Fifth Congressional District of Missouri in hon-
oring Swope Health for their dedicated leader-
ship, service, and care over the last fifty years.
RECOGNIZING JUDGE SADIE
HOLLAND
HON. TRENT KELLY
OF MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 15, 2019
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize Judge Sadie Holland,
who retired as the Lee County Justice Court
judge after 16 years of service.
Judge Holland made history as Lee Coun-
ty’s first female justice court judge. She is a
lifelong public servant, previously serving as a
Tupelo court administrator and is the former
Mayor of Nettleton, Mississippi. She also was
a school bus driver for 17 years. Judge Hol-
land’s influence in the community is so signifi-
cant that Lee County proclaimed November
3rd as ‘‘Sadie Holland Day.’’
Although she is retired from public service,
Judge Holland will remain active in the com-
munity and will continue to work as a funeral
director for Holland Funeral Directors in
Tupelo, Mississippi. Judge Sadie Holland is a
remarkable Mississippian who has set a shin-
ing example for others to follow. I wish her
many more years of good health.

RECOGNIZING JAKE PLUMMER
FOR HIS INDUCTION INTO THE
COLLEGE FOOTBALL HALL OF
FAME
HON. GREG STANTON
OF ARIZONA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 15, 2019
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize and honor Jake Plummer, a leg-
endary former student athlete at Arizona State
University who has earned induction into the
College Football Hall of Fame.
‘‘Jake the Snake’’ made his first pass as a
Sun Devil quarterback count: a 78-yard touch-
down in the team’s shutout win over the Uni-
versity of Utah. It’s clear that the world should
have known at that time, at that place, that
Plummer’s Sun Devil career would be one for
the ages. But few could have predicted the
heights the young gunslinger from Boise,
Idaho would take the program.
The Sun Devils needed a savior. After the
team consistently earned bowl game appear-
ances in the 1970s and 1980s, it was in the
midst of a decade-long drought as Plummer
entered his senior year as the team’s captain.
That year, 1996, there was renewed promise.
And under the guidance of head coach Bruce
Snyder, the team began the season with a
gritty roster and a Top 25 ranking.
Hopes for a Pac-10 championship nearly
ended as soon as they began. During the sea-
son opener, ASU squandered a 42–21 lead,
allowing the University of Washington to score
three straight touchdowns to tie the game.
With just a minute left in the fourth quarter, the
Sun Devil offense took the field and Plummer
orchestrated a 42-yard drive that set up a
game-winning field goal. Plummer and the
team showed they could overcome adversity—
an inner-strength they would need several
times throughout the season.
The nation finally took notice of this special
Sun Devil squad when it shut out two-time de-
fending national champion and top-ranked Ne-
braska Cornhuskers before more than 74,000

fans at Sun Devil Stadium on September 21,
1996. Plummer sparked the team’s stellar per-
formance, leading the team 80 yards down the
field on its first offensive drive and connecting
with wide receiver Keith Poole for a 25-yard
touchdown to put ASU on the board. The Sun
Devils’ 19–0 victory ended Nebraska’s 26-
game winning streak and marked just the sec-
ond time a No. 1 team had been shut out in
college football history.
For Plummer, highlights continued through-
out the year. After the Sun Devils fell behind
on the road to the UCLA Bruins, Plummer de-
livered on what is now one of the most memo-
rable plays in ASU history. With 6:45 left in
the fourth quarter, and the Devils on the Bru-
ins’ 16-yard line, Plummer handed the ball off
to halfback J.R. Redmond. Redmond moved
right, then faded back to throw the ball back
to Plummer, who caught it at the 10-yard line
before slithering past four Bruin defenders and
into the end zone for a touchdown.
After vanquishing its remaining Pac-10 op-
ponents, Plummer and the Sun Devils pum-
meled their arch-rival Arizona Wildcats with a
56–14 win in Tucson.
The undefeated Sun Devils earned the Pac-
10 championship and represented the con-
ference in the 1997 Rose Bowl.
Plummer’s season—and career—remains
one of the best in Sun Devil history. After the
1996 season, during which he threw 24 touch-
downs and for more than 2,500 yards, he was
named a finalist for the Heisman Trophy, rec-
ognized as the Pac-10 Offensive Player of the
Year, a second team All-American, and was a
two-time All-Academic All-Conference player.
Jake Plummer went on to be drafted into
the National Football League by the Arizona
Cardinals and also started for the Denver
Broncos, but it is his time at ASU—and espe-
cially his legendary senior season—that
earned him his spot in the Hall of Fame. He
remains a fan favorite in Tempe, and I am
honored to recognize his career and contribu-
tions to Arizona.

HONORING THE SACRIFICE OF PRI-
VATE FIRST CLASS JOSEPH ROB-
ERT LIVERMORE
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 15, 2019
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, it was
only two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor
when Joseph Robert Livermore chose to enlist
in the United States Marine Corps. At just the
young age of 19, he felt compelled to answer
the call to serve in the second World War, a
war that would take him across the globe to
defend this great nation.
Bob was a Private First Class and had been
serving in the military for nearly two years
when he arrived at the Battle of Tarawa. He
and his division initially survived the fight; a
presidential unit citation even lauded his unit’s
‘‘outstanding performance in combat’’ Sadly,
however, that same battle would eventually
cost Bob his life when he was fatally wounded
by an enemy bayonet.
Bob was laid to rest with 1,000 brothers-in-
arms on then Japanese-held Betio Island
where he would remain for nearly 80 years. It
wasn’t until July 30th of this year, that through
advances in technology and by the grace of
God, Bob’s remains were identified to be re-
turned home.
Though it has been nearly eight decades
since Bob’s passing, we must never forget
that he is much more than a name inscribed
on a memorial. He was a young man from Ba-
kersfield whose deep sense of patriotism and
love of country was instilled in him from an
early age. He attended East Bakersfield High
School where he was a star athlete of both
football and track. He was President of his
junior class. He was a loving brother and a
thoughtful son. And perhaps most importantly,
he was taken from this earth before his full po-
tential could be realized.
To Bob’s family here in attendance, please
know that we will never forget his sacrifice,
and we humbly join you in celebrating his life
today and commemorating his memory which
will far outlive any of us.
Bob’s story is a meaningful reminder that to-
morrow isn’t guaranteed, and that we should
be particularly grateful for our servicemen and
servicewomen who willingly put themselves in
harm’s way to defend our freedoms.
And to Bob, who I’m sure is smiling at us
from above, at long last, welcome home.
We’ve been waiting for him.

IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 4803 CITIZEN-
SHIP FOR CHILDREN OF MILI-
TARY MEMBERS AND CIVIL
SERVANTS ACT
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 15, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise
in strong support of H.R. 4803, the ‘‘Citizen-
ship for Children of Military Members and Civil
Servants Act.’’
H.R. 4803 establishes that a foreign-born
child of a U.S. citizen member of the Armed
Forces or government employee may auto-
matically acquire U.S. citizenship even if the
child is not residing in the United States.
This bill is necessary because the Trump
Administration announced on August 28, 2019
that it was changing its policy guidance and
ending automatic American citizenship for chil-
dren of U.S. service members and other fed-
eral workers stationed abroad.
With these changes, government employees
stationed abroad who are green card holders
would have to move back to the U.S. and live
there for three to five years in order to apply
for citizenship for their child.
Previously, children born to U.S. citizen par-
ents were considered to be ‘‘residing in the
United States,’’ and therefore would be auto-
matically granted citizenship under the Immi-
gration and Nationality Act § 320.
Without this legislation, children born abroad
to U.S. service members and government em-
ployees in U.S. military hospitals or diplomatic
facilities, will not be residing in the United
States, and thus will not considered American
citizens.
This disadvantages children of parents who
serve our country abroad.
Under H.R. 4803, necessary requirements
would be fulfilled if a foreign-born child is living
in the legal and physical custody of the citizen
armed services member or government em-
ployee who has been stationed abroad (or the
accompanying spouse of such a citizen), and
lawfully admitted for permanent residence in
the United States.
It is critical for the United States Congress
to stand with the women and men who have
served our country and allow their children citi-
zenship.
By allowing lawful, permanent resident chil-
dren of members of the U.S. Armed Forces or
federal government employees who are resid-
ing overseas to automatically acquire citizen-
ship once certain conditions are met, parents
avoid the inconvenience, expense, and paper-
work delays required under current law, and
continue their service commitment without
interruption.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in supporting H.R. 4803, and allow for-
eign-born children of U.S. citizens who have
served as a member of the Armed Forces or
are government’ employees, to automatically
acquire citizenship for their foreign born Amer-
ican child.

TRIBUTE TO DR. JAMES I. ‘‘BUD’’
ROBERTSON, JR.
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 15, 2019
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I offer rise
in tribute to Dr. James I. ‘‘Bud’’ Robertson, Jr.,
longtime professor at Virginia Polytechnic In-
stitute and State University in Blacksburg, Vir-
ginia, who passed away on November 2 at the
age of 89. Dr. Robertson, sometimes called
‘‘Mr. Virginia,’’ was a distinguished scholar of
the American Civil War.
Dr. Robertson was a native of Danville, Vir-
ginia. He earned his bachelor’s degree in his-
tory at Randolph-Macon College and his mas-
ter’s degree and doctorate in the same subject
at Emory University.
As the United States commemorated the
centennial of the Civil War in the 1960s, Presi-
dent Kennedy asked Dr. Robertson to serve
as executive director of the United States Civil
War Centennial Commission. After his suc-
cessful leadership of the commission, he
joined the Virginia Tech faculty in 1967. Over
the course of his career, he taught thousands
of students, wrote more than 20 books, be-
came founding director of the Virginia Center
for Civil War Studies, and educated the public
at large on the war. His biography of Stone-
wall Jackson earned acclaim as a definitive
account of the legendary general’s life, but the
experiences of the common soldiers who
served on both sides, ‘‘Billy Yank’’ and ‘‘John-
ny Reb,’’ occupied much of his study as well.
In the preface to Civil War Sites in Virginia:
A Tour Guide, Dr. Robertson told of a ceme-
tery at Appomattox, where a Federal soldier is
buried next to Confederates. He wrote: ‘‘They
sleep side by side, and it is fitting that they do;
for these American heroes who lived not so
long ago struggled greatly against something
greater than themselves. Often fighting for
nothing more than the realization of a dream,
they bravely marched down the undiscovered
road to tomorrow. What they gave, we now
share. What they lost, we gained. Their sac-
rifice is the nation’s legacy.’’
Dr. Robertson devoted himself to the study
of that legacy. He did it with skill and with an

enthusiasm that could affect anyone who
heard his lectures or commentary.
Among the many awards he earned over his
career were three commendations from the
Virginia General Assembly, the Virginia Press
Association’s 2004 Virginian of the Year, the
Best NonFiction Book Award by the Library of
Virginia in 1997, and the Outstanding Pro-
fessor Award of the Virginia Council for Higher
Education. In turn, Dr. Robertson strongly sup-
ported Virginia Tech financially and through
the donation of a large portion of his enor-
mous collection of Civil War books.
After his retirement from Virginia Tech, Dr.
Robertson resided in Virginia’s Northern Neck.
He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth ‘‘Betty
Lee’’ Robertson; his sons, James I. Robertson
III and Howard Robertson; his daughter, Beth
Brown; his stepson, William W. Lee Jr.; his
stepdaughter, Elizabeth A. Lee; seven grand-
children; and four great-grandchildren. I would
like to express my condolences to them and to
the Virginia Tech community on the loss of
this fine scholar and gentleman.

30 YEARS AFTER THE FALL OF
THE BERLIN WALL: HONORING
HIS EXCELLENCY LECH WAŁȨSA,
THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF PO-
LAND
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 15, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, it is my great
pleasure to be here today to help welcome
back to Washington a true hero of democracy,
former President Lech Wałȩsa.
Thirty years ago, we all watched with sur-
prise and jubilation at the fall of the Berlin
Wall, for decades the symbol of repression
and tyranny that had fallen over the states be-
hind the Iron Curtain. As it happens, that was
my first year as a member of Congress. What
followed the fall of the wall was the collapse
of the totalitarian regimes and the restoration
of those countries to their place among the
world’s democracies. This was an incredibly
momentous occasion, we in Congress under-
stand that.
In November of 1989, a humble electrician
from the working-class Polish city of Gdansk
spoke before a joint session of the United
States Congress. I remember it well. He de-
scribed his years-long struggle for freedom
and asked for support from the United States.
That man, of course, was soon-to-be Presi-
dent Wałȩsa.
More than anyone else, President Wałȩsa
helped us understand the heroic and honor-
able fight that the people of Poland and others
throughout central and eastern Europe were
waging to win their freedom over dictatorship.
We understood that the people of Europe
needed our help in this struggle for freedom.
And U.S. support was indeed critical in helping
those countries transition to democracy.
Thirty years later, some of those countries
need our help again. While the specter of
communism has faded, many countries in cen-
tral and eastern Europe face renewed threats
to democracy. Today at a hearing of the Euro-
pean subcommittee, President Wałȩsa and
other experts described some of these new
threats, in countries like Poland, Hungary, and
Turkey, where increasingly authoritarian lead-
ers are undermining democracy and the rule
of law. We owe it to President Wałȩsa and all
the others who continue to fight for democracy
in the region to show our support.
I want to close by thanking President
Wałȩsa for everything he has done in support
of freedom and democracy, and for visiting
with us today. And I want to urge everyone
that we can best honor President Wałȩsa’s
legacy by continuing the fight against
authoritarianism wherever we may find it.

and Bertha Duncan in Appleton, WI. He at-
tended Menasha High School and graduated
in the Class of 1965. Jim then served in the
U.S. Army in Korea during the Vietnam War
as a medic. Upon returning home from serv-
ice, Jim was employed as the fourth ever
paramedic in the state of Wisconsin through
Gold Cross Ambulance where he aided the
community for 30 years.
Jim continued to serve his community from
1998 to 2019, holding various leadership posi-
tions on the Outagamie County Board. He uti-
lized his extensive background as an Army
medic and an emergency responder during his
time on the Public Safety Committee. Jim was
an advocate for rehabilitation and a supporter
of jail diversion programs, like drug treatment
court and veterans treatment court.
In addition to his service on the County
Board, Jim was actively involved with several
organizations throughout the Fox Valley. He
assisted in fundraising, event planning, and
medical care for the Special Olympics, was a
foster father for over 15 years, and volun-
teered with the food pantry through Fox Valley
Christian Fellowship.
Jim was a true altruist who was tireless and
tenacious in his efforts to help others. He al-
ways went the extra mile to serve when others
around him would not. His goal was not to
surpass all others at any cost, but to serve
others whatever the cost. Jim’s leadership will
be missed by all.
Madam Speaker, it is truly an honor to rec-
ognize Jim’s selfless service to our country.
His love of country and service to the Fox Val-
ley community will always be remembered. I
offer my sincerest condolences to Jim’s family.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1455
November 15, 2019
In the summer of 1984, while on vacation in
Europe, John McDonald, founder of Boulevard
Brewing Company, discovered his love and in-
trigue for Belgian beers. It was this curiosity
and interest, coupled with the opportunity to
address a gap in the market that fueled
McDonald’s dream. Kansas City was once
home to more than a dozen breweries, pro-
ducing a wide array of beers, but had suc-
cumbed to the industrial onslaught, leaving the
city left with none. This, in conjunction with the
homogenous nature of American beers being
produced at the time, encouraged McDonald
to continue to pursue this interest, embarking
on an endeavor that would come to be a so-
cial and cultural pillar of Kansas City.
After attending art school, McDonald began
home brewing, put together a business plan,
sold his house to raise money, and sought
necessary resources to start the brewery. In
line with his creative background, McDonald’s
vision for the brewery was innovative, unique,
and stood in stark contrast to what many
breweries across the country looked like and
produced.
McDonald began renovation in an old brick
building along the historic Southwest Boule-
vard, which once housed the laundry for the
Santa Fe Railroad. In November 1989, after
more than a year of working tirelessly to ret-
rofit the building, the first keg of Boulevard
Pale Ale was loaded into the back of McDon-
ald’s pickup truck and delivered to a res-
taurant down the street.
For the first year, the small crew worked
lengthy hours brewing, kegging, cleaning, and
working to persuade bar and restaurant own-
ers to put Boulevard beers on tap, as the
company initially only produced draft beers.
Knowing that the bottling of Boulevard’s prod-
uct would open doors to new opportunities
and growth, McDonald worked to secure fund-
ing for bottling lines. After overcoming rejec-
tion by bank after bank, one institution saw
promise in Boulevard’s vision and enabled the
brewing company to install a very small, used
bottling line. With this line in place, Boulevard
quickly found itself becoming the talk of the
town and built a notable reputation for itself.
With its rapid growth came concerns of out-
growing the space in which Boulevard Brewing
Company was founded. Faced with the deci-
sion to relocate or revitalize, McDonald chose
to revitalize the historic building on Southwest
Boulevard in 2006 in a $25 million project that
expanded into a new building with a 150–bar-
rel brewhouse, packaging halls, and hospitality
spaces. With sales reaching nearly 300,000
barrels, this renovation allowed the company
to increase their potential brewing capacity to
700,000 barrels annually. In the years fol-
lowing, McDonald continued to create new
products and grow Boulevard’s presence.
Boulevard soon found their products spanning
coast-to-coast, from California to Washington,
D.C. by the mid-2000s.
Eventually, their progress came full-circle
when McDonald was approached by Michael
Moortgat, President and fourth generation
leader of Duvel Moortgat, maker of Duvel
beer, which first set John McDonald on his
journey in brewing. In 2014, Boulevard be-
came part of the Duvel Moortgat family, a col-
lection of artisanal breweries dedicated to the
highest expression of the brewers’ art.
Today, Jeff Krum serves as President of
Boulevard Brewing Company, Brewery
Ommegang of Cooperstown, NY, and Duvel
Moortgat USA. Krum has been with Boulevard
since its founding and is committed to taking
the brewery even further. Krum has also been
an active contributor to our Kansas City com-
munity in other ways, founding Ripple Glass,
which created a local and regional glass recy-
cling solution, and serving on the board on di-
rectors of the Kansas City Streetcar Authority,
the Downtown Transportation Development
District, and the Kansas City Economic Devel-
opment Corporation.
To this day, Boulevard remains steadfast in
its commitment to the original vision and mis-
sion set forth by McDonald, helping to redefine
American beer while having a lasting positive
impact on the Kansas City community.
Through these efforts, Boulevard Brewing
Company has established itself as the Mid-
west’s largest specialty brewer.
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Boulevard Brewing Company’s thirtieth
anniversary and celebrating their innovation,
vision, and impact in Kansas City and beyond.

IN HONOR OF CLAUDETTE COLVIN
FOR HER COURAGE DURING THE
CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND
CONTRIBUTION TO AMERICAN
HISTORY
HON. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 15, 2019
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Madam Speaker, I
rise to recognize Claudette Colvin, an Amer-
ican Civil Rights pioneer, who on March 2,
1955, at the age of 15, was arrested in Mont-
gomery, Alabama for refusing to give up her
seat to a young white woman passenger, be-
coming one of many to be arrested for chal-
lenging Montgomery’s bus segregation poli-
cies. Nine months later, Rosa Parks was fa-
mously arrested for performing the same act
of defiance. Although there were hundreds of
people arrested before Claudette and Rosa
Parks, Claudette along with Aurelia Browder,
Susie McDonald, and Mary Louise Smith,
were the first to challenge the law in the Ala-
bama courts.
Prior to her historic 1955 stand against ra-
cial injustice, Claudette had been studying
Black leaders like Harriet Tubman and So-
journer Truth during Negro History Month in
her segregated school. Claudette’s classroom
conversations led to discussions around the
current day Jim Crow laws she and all her
peers were experiencing. In describing the sig-
nificant moment when a bus driver ordered
her to give up her seat to a young white
woman, and she refused, Claudette says:
‘‘Whenever people ask me: ’Why didn’t you
get up when the bus driver asked you?’ I say
it felt as though Harriet Tubman’s hands were
pushing me down on one shoulder and So-
journer Truth’s hands were pushing me down
on the other shoulder. I felt inspired by these
women because my teacher taught us about
them in so much detail.’’
After a year-long battle in the courts, being
ostracized by her peers and the community,
an older man befriended her, and she became
pregnant. In addition, she was a 15-year-old
teenager, from a low-income family, and she
had very dark skin. Therefore, the leaders
deemed Claudette inappropriate to be the face
of the Bus Boycott.
Claudette’s heroic story was nearly forgotten
by history. The story of Claudette illustrates
how the role of women in the Civil Rights
movement has been largely overlooked. Her
actions led to monumental progress in our na-
tion’s history. Not only that, her heroic actions
led to the rise of other great African Ameri-
cans. If not for Claudette’s brave act, there
may not have been a Thurgood Marshall,
Robert L. Carter, Martin Luther King, Jr., or
Rosa Parks. She truly paved the way for our
nation’s history.
Claudette, Aurelia Browder, Susie McDon-
ald, and Mary Louise Smith were among the
four women plaintiffs to testify in the federal
court case filed by civil rights attorney Fred
Gray on February 1, 1956, as Browder v.
Gayle. On June 13, 1956, the three- judge
panel that heard the case in the United States
District Court determined that the state and
local laws requiring bus segregation in Ala-
bama were unconstitutional. The case went to
the United States Supreme Court, which
upheld their ruling on December 17, 1956.
Three days later, the Supreme Court issued
an order to Montgomery and the state of Ala-
bama to end bus segregation. This order not
only ended bus segregation in Alabama, but
also impacted public transportation throughout
the Unites States, including airplanes, taxis
and trains.
In 1987, The 100th Congress designated
March as ‘‘Women’s History Month’’ in honor
of the tremendous contributions of women to
society, and to recognize that despite these
contributions, the role of women in history has
consistently been overlooked and undervalued
in our history books. Claudette is testament to
the fact that we are still discovering new ac-
complishments of historical women, and we
will continue to shine a light on these amazing
icons for years to come. Though their historic
acts of civil disobedience were separated by
nine-months, Claudette and Rosa Parks re-
main intertwined in the same movement.
Claudette knew Rosa very well, was active in
Rosa’s youth group, and considered Rosa an
inspiration to her own beliefs and actions.
Rosa and Claudette’s mother, Mary Jane Aus-
tin (Gadson), grew up together in Pine Level,
Alabama. Her mother used to play with Rosa
and her brother Sylvester at Ms. Leona’s
house, Rosa’s mother. Rosa also knew
Claudette’s great grandfather, Gus Vaughn,
who has been mentioned in several of her
books.
Madam Speaker, I ask our colleagues to
join me in recognizing Ms. Claudette Calvin’s
courage to stand in the face of injustice and
demand her recognition of her inalienable
rights. Because in her own courage to fight for
her freedom, she paved a path for millions of
others to do the same—because it was her
constitutional right.

the competitiveness of the United States, to
reform and reauthorize the United States
Export Finance Agency, and for other pur-
poses:
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chair, I rise
today in strong support of H.R. 4863, the
United States Export Finance Agency Act.
This legislation will reauthorize the United
States Export-Import Bank for a decade, in-
crease the agency’s capabilities to keep ex-
porters here in the United States competitive
worldwide, and ensures that the Export-Import
Bank is prepared for the future by establishing
offices within the agency focused on clean en-
ergy.
Four years ago, Republicans and Demo-
crats in this chamber came together to sign a
discharge petition overruling the desire of a
vocal minority that was ill informed about the
important role the Export Import Bank plays in
ensuring that products produced here in the
United States can find buyers around the
world. They wanted to shut this agency down.
Thankfully, cooler minds prevailed, and the
agency was reauthorized.
This agency is vital to the many farmers,
small businesses, and manufacturers who ex-
port their products around the world from
Texas. Approximately 12 billion dollars in ex-
ports from Texas are reliant on the Export-Im-
port Bank. Businesses like Continental Elec-
tronics Corporation in my district, which
produce radio frequency broadcast trans-
mission equipment, rely on the Export-Import
Bank to ensure their high-quality products can
be sold to potential buyers across the world.
Without the Export-Import Bank, buyers would
have to settle for mediocre knockoff products
produced in places like China.
Mr. Chair, being from a state where our
economy thrives thanks to trade, I understand
the importance of this legislation. But it’s not
just me, labor groups like the AFL–CIO, along-
side business groups like the Chamber of
Commerce support this import legislation. It’s
not often that you can get those two groups to
agree on something. I urge my colleagues to
pass this legislation and for the Senate to take
this up immediately so that we can provide
certainty to our exporters and continue to grow
our economy in the right direction.
