Vol. 165 WASHINGTON, MONDAY, JULY 22, 2019 No. 123

The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was

tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).
f
PRAYER
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The
Chaplain of the House of Representa-
tives, Father Patrick Conroy, will open
the Senate with prayer.
The guest Chaplain offered the fol-
lowing prayer:
Let us pray.
Righteous God, deliver Your people
from evil. Set our lawmakers on safe
paths, protecting them from dangers.
Preserve them and their loved ones,
keeping them from stumbling.
Provide our Senators with counsel,
even in the night sessions where they
may prevail against the evil that seeks
to destroy our Nation and world. As
they trust Your loving-kindness, may
their hearts rejoice in Your salvation.
Lord, deal bountifully with them and
the members of their staffs.
We pray in Your marvelous Name.
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The President pro tempore led the
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

MEASURES PLACED ON THE
CALENDAR—H.R. 582 AND H.R. 748
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first,
I have a duty to perform for the leader.
I understand that there are two bills
at the desk due a second reading en
bloc.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will read the titles of the bills for
the second time.
The bill clerk read as follows:
A bill (H.R. 582) to provide for increases in
the Federal minimum wage, and for other
purposes.
A bill (H.R. 748) to amend the Internal Rev-
enue Code of 1986 to repeal the excise tax on
high cost employer-sponsored health cov-
erage.
Mr. GRASSLEY. In order to place
the bills on the calendar under the pro-
visions of rule XIV, I object to further
proceedings en bloc.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion having been heard, the bills will be
placed on the calendar.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask
to speak as in morning business for 1
minute.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
f
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA
TRADE AGREEMENT
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, pass-
ing the United States-Mexico-Canada
Agreement means more market access
for our farmers and businesses and
more protection for our workers. This
agreement includes new commitments
in critical areas such as customs, dig-
ital trade, services, environment, and
labor that are crucial to bringing high-
er wages and more jobs to American
workers.
Of course, enforcement is key to a
strong and durable trade agreement
that will deliver all of the benefits that
I just listed. We need enforcement
measures that work for all aspects of
this agreement.
It is time to bring NAFTA into the
21st century, and that is what the U.S.-
Mexico-Canada Agreement will do. The
time for USMCA is now.
I yield the floor.
I suggest the absence of a quorum.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
clerk will call the roll.
The bill clerk proceeded to call the
roll.
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
I ask unanimous consent that the order
for the quorum call be rescinded.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
BLACKBURN). Without objection, it is so
ordered.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY
LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
f
NOMINATION OF MARK T. ESPER
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,
the Senate’s first order of business this
week will be confirming a thoroughly
well-prepared nominee to a post of
vital national importance. Later today,
we will vote to advance the nomination
of Dr. Mark Esper to serve as Secretary
of Defense, and we will vote on his con-
firmation tomorrow.
When Dr. Esper was nominated in
July of 2017 to serve as Secretary of the
Army, he already possessed an impres-
sive record that spanned public service,
the private sector, and, of course, his
distinguished service in uniform. As a
student, he excelled at West Point. He
served honorably in combat during the
Gulf war as an infantry officer with
Kentucky’s own 101st Airborne, the
Screaming Eagles. He then later ob-
tained a master’s degree from the Ken-
nedy School at Harvard and a Ph.D.
from George Washington University.
In the years since, Dr. Esper has con-
tinued to serve his country, compiling
an outstanding record in public service.
He has served as Deputy Assistant Sec-
retary at the Pentagon; as a Senate-ap-
pointed member of the U.S.-China Eco-
nomic and Security Review Commis-
sion; and, of course, as a trusted staff
expert right here in the Capitol.
As a result, many of our colleagues
have been familiar with this nominee
for more than a decade. Members on
both sides remember Mark Esper from
his time on staff with our former col-
league Chuck Hagel. Some knew him
during his tenure with the Foreign Re-
lations Committee or with what was

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4958 July 22, 2019
then the Governmental Affairs Com-
mittee, and many of us inevitably
crossed paths with the smart and level-
headed national security adviser for
Majority Leader Bill Frist.
So, when President Trump first nom-
inated Dr. Esper to be Secretary of the
Army 2 years ago, my colleagues and I
were well acquainted with his exper-
tise, his professionalism, and his patri-
otic dedication to the men and women
who serve to keep us safe. It is no won-
der that this body confirmed him to
that post by an overwhelming bipar-
tisan margin. Since then, Secretary
Esper has continued to impress. He has
continued to earn the praise of experts
and colleagues from every corner of the
national security landscape.
‘‘He’s highly regarded inside the
Army. Soldiers like him.’’
He is ‘‘someone who can work across
the aisle . . . somebody who can work
with Congress.’’
Additionally, he is ‘‘superbly well
qualified by experience and tempera-
ment for the position.’’
Another quote: ‘‘The nation would be
lucky to have Mark serve in any capac-
ity . . . He is particularly well-suited
to step into one of the most important
jobs in the world.’’
This is high praise from former Pen-
tagon officials of the Obama years and
from widely recognized national secu-
rity professionals. Just last week, our
colleagues on the Armed Services Com-
mittee offered a ringing endorsement
of their own by voting by voice to fa-
vorably report his nomination to the
floor.
It would be hard to draw up a more
compelling case than the one in front
of us for confirming Dr. Mark Esper,
and it is hard to imagine a more per-
suasive argument for doing it right
away—with no further delay—than the
front pages of newspapers all around
the world every day.
The world is full of serious threats to
America, to our allies, and to our in-
terests. Not the least among them, ob-
viously, is Iran’s insistence on con-
tinuing to ratchet up tensions in the
Middle East. Having a Senate-con-
firmed Secretary of Defense, especially
one of this quality, could not have
come a moment too soon.
In closing, when Secretary Esper
took his last job, he wrote Army per-
sonnel a letter that laid out three pri-
orities: readiness, modernization, and
reform. Since then, he has played an
active role in this administration’s ef-
forts to restore the primacy and
lethality of America’s fighting forces,
and the success of defense authoriza-
tions and ongoing operations abroad
bear his fingerprints.
We are reminded every day that this
work continues, and we are reminded
why. My colleagues should be proud to
join me today in voting to advance the
Esper nomination and in putting the
right man on the job.

ator from Texas.
BORDER SECURITY
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, over
a week ago, I traveled to the Texas-
Mexico border with the Vice President,
as well as the Presiding Officer and
other Republicans on the Senate Judi-
ciary Committee. We visited McAllen,
which is located in the heart of the Rio
Grande Valley, which is a beautiful re-
gion with a thriving economy, but
folks in the region continue to struggle
to manage the growing humanitarian
crisis caused by the massive influx of
migrants arriving at our southern bor-
der.
The Rio Grande Valley has been
disproportionally impacted by this mi-
grant crisis, with 46 percent of all ap-
prehensions last month occurring in
that sector. It has taken a toll, as you
might expect, on the Border Patrol, the
Department of Health and Human
Services, local communities, and the
nongovernmental organizations work-
ing to provide care for these migrants.
Our trip provided the opportunity for
the Vice President and members of the
Judiciary Committee to meet with the
men and women who are on the
frontlines of this crisis and hear about
the challenges they face every day. We
also discussed what Congress needs to
do to help them address this crisis.
Chairman LINDSEY GRAHAM invited
all the members of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, both Republicans and Demo-
crats, to go on the trip, but unfortu-
nately none of our Democratic col-
leagues accepted that invitation. In-
stead of going on a bipartisan basis,
Senate Democrats chose to wait a week
and go on what was clearly a partisan
messaging mission.
The minority leader said the purpose
of the trip was to ‘‘investigate, inspect
and evaluate conditions for migrants
at facilities on the border.’’ They trav-
eled to McAllen—exactly where we
were 1 week before—and they had a
very similar itinerary, but they had a
very different mission. Our mission was
to find out what Congress needed to do
to help fix the problem; theirs was to
shine a light in a partisan fashion on
conditions of migrants, which are
largely of Congress’s own making as a
result of congressional inaction on
dealing with the underlying causes.
We both met with Chief Patrol Agent
Rudy Karisch, toured the Donna hold-
ing facility, heard from Border Patrol
agents, and had the chance to speak to
the migrants themselves, but our
takeaways from these nearly identical
trips were quite different. This was like
ships passing in the night.
I left that trip feeling immense grati-
tude for our professional Border Patrol
agents, whom we met, working tire-
lessly to fulfill their duties with the
utmost professionalism and compas-
sion. As this crisis has grown, they
have been asked to do more and more
with less and less. They go to work
each morning not knowing exactly
what the day will bring. Will they en-
counter a group of hundreds of mi-
grants? Will they find abandoned chil-
dren left for dead by smugglers? Will
they rescue a drowning family from the
Rio Grande or, worse, find the remains
of those who have succumbed due to
the dangerous journey in very hot
weather?
This growing crisis is not the fault of
our professional law enforcement offi-
cials working along the border, and de-
spite what our colleagues across the
aisle claim, it is not a side effect of the
2016 Presidential election either. This
migrant crisis has been bubbling up for
years. We got a glimpse of how bad it
could be in 2014 when then-President
Obama announced there was a ‘‘human-
itarian and security crisis’’—his
words—on the southern border. In May
of 2014—the height of apprehensions
that year—nearly 69,000 people were de-
tained at the southern border. In May
of this year, that number more than
doubled to 144,000 in 1 month alone. So
President Obama called it a ‘‘humani-
tarian and security crisis’’ in 2014, and
the problem has roughly doubled since
that time.
If there is one thing I hope our col-
leagues found on their trip, as the mi-
nority leader said, to investigate, in-
spect, and evaluate, I hope it is this: I
hope their investigation confirmed
what they have reflexively denied for
months on end—that there is, in fact, a
crisis at the border. I hope their inspec-
tion revealed that the problem isn’t
with the administration’s policies or
with the actions of our Border Patrol;
it is our broken immigration system.
And I hope they evaluated that with-
out some type of action—real action—
by Congress, the situation along the
border will only continue to get worse.
As this senseless partisanship over
border security carries on, people liv-
ing and working along the border are
also hurting. When we were in McAllen
a week and a half ago, we heard from
one Border Patrol agent, Oscar
Escamilla, who talked about the role
Border Patrol plays at the centralized
processing centers. He said:
We wear different hats. Sometimes we’re
fathers, sometimes we’re mothers, brothers,
sisters, play pals, and even counselors. We do
this because we care. We do this because
there is a real need.
There is certainly a need.
Last month, we passed bipartisan
legislation to send much needed hu-
manitarian relief, which will provide
some temporary help. That bill also in-
cluded funding for the departments and
agencies that have depleted their re-
sources trying to manage this crisis
the best they can, and it made $30 mil-
lion available for impacted commu-
nities to apply for reimbursement from
the Federal Government. In other
words, they have had to pay out of
their own pockets for something that
is the Federal Government’s responsi-
bility, and I am glad that at least we
provided $30 million for reimburse-
ment.
This was a long-overdue and impor-
tant step to support those who have
been working day in and day out, hour

by hour, minute by minute, to manage
this crisis, but, as the folks we talked
about in McAllen reiterated, the under-
lying problem still exists. In other
words, you can treat the symptoms, or
you can treat the cause. But we
shouldn’t be confused. We have been
maybe addressing some of the symp-
toms; we have done nothing to address
the underlying cause.
These officers and agents work in-
credibly hard to enforce our laws and
provide compassionate care for those in
their custody, but without meaningful
action from Congress, we are sending
them into a losing battle. Without fix-
ing the loopholes and repairing the bro-
ken system that facilitated this hu-
manitarian crisis in the first place, we
will find ourselves experiencing deja vu
every few months. If you think $4.5 bil-
lion was needed for this emergency just
a couple of weeks ago, wait for 6 more
months, when there will be another $4.5
billion required and thereafter and
thereafter and thereafter.
Well, what is the answer to the un-
derlying root cause? What does Con-
gress need to do in order to fix it and
to staunch this flow of humanity
across our border?
Well, there is only one bill out there
with bipartisan support—with support
both in the House of Representatives
and the U.S. Senate—that would pro-
vide relief along the border, and that is
the HUMANE Act. It is an honest, non-
partisan attempt to fix the problem—
no poison pills, no radical proposals,
just reasonable policy designed to solve
the problem.
This bill would close what has be-
come known as the Flores loophole,
which is often exploited by human
smugglers as a way to gain entry into
the United States. This is an effective
way to stem the flow of those trying to
game—to game—our immigration sys-
tem without inhibiting legitimate
trade or travel.
In addition, the HUMANE Act would
improve the way we process individuals
entering into our country. We got the
recommendation for the legislation
from the bipartisan Homeland Security
Advisory Committee. It would, for ex-
ample, establish regional processing
centers, which would have personnel on
hand from across the government to
assist, including medical personnel and
asylum officers right there at the bor-
der in regional processing centers.
Finally, it would improve standards
of care for individuals in our custody—
something we all want to see happen.
It would require the Department of
Homeland Security to keep families to-
gether during court proceedings and
ensure that migrants have timely ac-
cess to medical assistance, as well as
recreational activities, educational
services, and even legal counsel.
The HUMANE Act also requires addi-
tional training for Customs and Border
Protection and ICE officers, otherwise
known as Immigration and Customs
Enforcement—in other words, everyone
who deals with children.
The HUMANE Act is the only bipar-
tisan bill currently proposed, and I
would urge all of our colleagues to give
it serious consideration.
I can only hope that this trip our
Democratic colleagues took convinced
them that it is time to quit playing
games and get serious about finding a
solution to the humanitarian crisis on
our southern border.
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO JUDY SCHNEIDER
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to recognize and thank an
extraordinary public servant, one who
has contributed greatly to the U.S.
Senate.
Next week, my constituent Judy
Schneider will retire after a long and
very distinguished career serving the
U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives, and the Congressional Re-
search Service, where she has earned a
reputation as one of the Nation’s top
experts on the workings of the Con-
gress. She has joined us in the Gallery
today, so I hope all my colleagues will
make sure we pay attention and play
by the rules.
When I was a new Member of Con-
gress, a Member of the House of Rep-
resentatives, one of my very first meet-
ings was with Judy Schneider. I was
proud Judy was my constituent in
Maryland’s Eighth Congressional Dis-
trict, and I was glad to have the benefit
of her advice. Since then, I have sought
her counsel many times during my
years in the House and the Senate.
Judy’s service at the Congressional
Research Service has been nothing
short of extraordinary. Over the past
four decades, she has educated hun-
dreds of Members of Congress and their
staff on congressional operations and
procedures. As the author of numerous
articles and the coauthor of the ‘‘Con-
gressional Deskbook: The Practical
and Comprehensive Guide to Con-
gress,’’ Judy’s expertise on the intrica-
cies of congressional structures and
procedures is unmatched. Judy is
known equally well for the positive
personal impact she has had on each of
her students. From giving lectures to
countless conferences, to her ‘‘Direct
Connect to Congress’’ series, Judy’s
impact has been far-reaching. Through
her dynamic, informative, and humor-
ous style, she has been described as
having a life-changing impact on her
students.
For her remarkable work, Judy
Schneider has received a number of
well-deserved and prestigious awards.
She received the 1988 PLEN Mentor
Award for her work educating and
training women in public policy, a fel-
lowship in the 108th Congress through
the Stennis Center for Public Service
Leadership, and the Distinguished
Member Award from Women in Govern-
ment Relations. In 2015, Women in Gov-
ernment Relations created the Judy
Schneider Fellowship in recognition of
her efforts to educate women about
congressional procedure and policy.
Judy has mentored thousands of
women, and this fellowship will ensure
that her legacy is felt by many more.
Last year, Judy received the Life-
time Achievement in Democracy
Award from the Congressional Manage-
ment Foundation in recognition of her
outstanding impact and important
work in Congress. This award truly ex-
emplifies the role Judy Schneider has
played for so many of us. Her mission
has always been clear. Because of her
deep love for this institution and for
our country, she has used her unique
talents to try to help make our democ-
racy work better. She has trained gen-
erations of staff and Members, includ-
ing a number of staff who later became
Members of Congress themselves.
She represents the very best of public
service. She exemplifies the spirit of
service in a way few have, bringing the
legislative process to life with humor
and passion. Her presentations—packed
with information and insight and deliv-
ered with wit and humor—were de-
signed to train Members of Congress
and their staff so we as a body function
better and, consequently, so our de-
mocracy functions better. If some of us
are finding that the Senate is not func-
tioning particularly well at the mo-
ment, we can’t say we weren’t taught
better. As they say, you can lead a
Senator to ‘‘Riddick’s Senate Proce-
dure,’’ but you can’t make him or her
read.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4960 July 22, 2019
Some have been heard to say they
have found Judy to be just a little bit
intimidating. What is intimidating
about Judy is the depth of her knowl-
edge of this institution, her pursuit of
excellence in her work, the exacting
standards she practiced and demanded
of others, and her unyielding commit-
ment to quality. Most importantly, her
deep love and concern for the U.S. Con-
gress is reflected in all she does.
I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing the transformative impact
Judy Schneider has had on this body
and in thanking her for her career at
CRS, her dedication to public service,
and the lifetime of work that has truly
made a difference in the lives and ca-
reers of Members of Congress. I know
that while we will miss her daily pres-
ence in these halls, Judy Schneider’s
commitment to Congress will continue
to inspire us to serve this institution
and the people we represent to the best
of our abilities. I know that would be
the highest tribute to Judy we could
pay.
Since Judy Schneider is a stickler for
procedure, I now suggest the absence of
a quorum.

HEALTHCARE
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to
speak about an issue that, candidly, we
don’t talk enough about around here,
and that is the threat to the Affordable
Care Act and the lawsuit that was filed
and is now in a Federal court. This
time, it is in the Circuit Court of Ap-
peals for the Fifth Circuit.
Earlier this month, there were oral
arguments. This case could be decided
in a short timeframe, maybe even this
fall. I guess, because it is not an issue
that is being debated in the Halls of
Congress by way of hearings or votes or
otherwise, it doesn’t get the attention
it warrants.
This lawsuit, which is now a direct
challenge to the constitutionality of
the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act, would be every bit as dev-
astating and harmful as the repeal ef-
forts that were undertaken two sum-
mers ago, in 2017, and the consequences
of the success in that lawsuit would
put the country in the same place it
would have been had the repeal effort
been successful.
If you want to simplify it, the Afford-
able Care Act has two parts to it. We
know, for example, of the protections
that were put in place in the Affordable
Care Act, one was new protections, and
the other was new coverage. So, rough-
ly, 20 million people got coverage who
didn’t have coverage before. Most of
those 20 million, at the time—or a
higher number at least—were folks who
had gained their healthcare coverage
through Medicaid expansion. As we
now know, Medicaid expansion has had
a number of positive impacts on the
American people.
It really came into force—came into
effect—right in the middle of or in one
of the early stages of our broader
awareness of the opioid crisis, of the
addiction crisis. Were it not for the ex-
pansion of Medicaid, a lot of people in
my home State of Pennsylvania and
around the country would not have had
treatment for opioid misuse or for the
broader category of substance use dis-
order conditions. Medicaid expansion
has helped a lot of people with treat-
ment, which is essential to freeing
yourself from the grip of an addiction
we have seen so often.
This lawsuit was successful in the
district court. If it were to be affirmed,
for example, in the Fifth Circuit, it
would mean this court would declare
the Affordable Care Act as unconstitu-
tional. The effect of that would be that
Medicaid expansion would go away—
protections for a much larger number
of Americans, not simply those who
need opioid treatment or treatment for
opioid addictions or for substance use
disorder conditions and not just for
those who have been newly enrolled—
for the roughly 20 million who have
gotten coverage.
When you are talking about the pro-
tections, you are talking about a much
larger number of Americans—maybe as
high as 150 million Americans or
more—who have protections not only
in the circumstances in which they had
preexisting conditions but also protec-
tions against capping the coverage one
would get or the treatment one would
get over a year or over a lifetime,
which is just to mention two or three
new protections. For example, it would
go away for all of those young people
who have been able to stay on their
parents’ health insurance plans until
the age of 26. So you are talking about
a tremendous coverage loss of at least
millions of people—potentially as high
as 20-plus million people—and the
elimination of protections for tens and
tens and tens of millions of Americans.
You would think, in that cir-
cumstance, those who have been most
determined to have the Affordable Care
Act struck down—because they have

had about 8 years now, give or take, to
prepare something with which to re-
place it—would have a replacement
ready to go, maybe a replacement en-
acted into law, but at least a replace-
ment that is ready to go on day one
that would have all of the details
worked out. This would not be just any
replacement—not just a replacement
that has words like ‘‘preexisting condi-
tions’’ in the title of the bill—but
something real and substantial and
credible on a complicated subject like
healthcare, meaning that the replace-
ment would cover at least 20 million
people, would provide all of the protec-
tions for all of those Americans,
whether it is on protections against a
preexisting condition or otherwise, and
would be comparable in its positive im-
pact on Americans. You would think
this bill would be ready to go and ready
to be enacted into law, but that is not
the case.
I shouldn’t say I was surprised, but I
was somewhat concerned when—I guess
it was last week, about a week ago—I
picked up POLITICO and read that a
number of Republican Senators were
expressing the hope that the lawsuit
would be successful, the hope that the
Affordable Care Act would be declared
unconstitutional. Yet what I didn’t see
in that article and didn’t see in a lot of
other places is a replacement that will
provide a comparable, if not identical,
measure of protection. That is what
they told us all along—right?—that
they have another way to do it and
that all of the American people are
going to be better off because of it.
That is the basic promise that has been
made by the Republicans in the Senate
and in the House over many years. So
you would think it would be ready, but
it apparently is not ready.
I hope that maybe in the month of
August, the plan will be developed and
be ready to go and not just any old
plan that has a nice title on it and a
surge of protections that can’t be
brought to fruition—or brought into ef-
fect—because, when you provide the
kind of protections the Affordable Care
Act provides, you have to make the
math work. You have to make sure you
can pay for it, and you have to make
sure the policy will support what you
promise in the details of the legisla-
tion.
We will see what happens. If this law-
suit were to be affirmed at the circuit
court level, I am assuming there would
be an appeal by one side or the other.
Yet, if we reach a point at which a
court says the ACA is unconstitu-
tional, I hope there is going to be a re-
placement that will provide all of the
protections, all of the coverage, and all
of the essential elements that were in
the Affordable Care Act but that they
will be done in a better way because
that is what they have all promised on
the other side. I don’t think it is likely
to happen. Something is going to give.
Something will be cut. Something will
be taken away or a lot more than that.
By way of an example, I will use only
one number for today—642,000. I think
it is 642,700. That is the estimate of the
number of children who live in Penn-
sylvania who have preexisting condi-
tions. So any change in law by way of
a court—a Federal court or the Su-
preme Court or otherwise—or any
change in law pursuant to congres-
sional action has to make sure, among
many things, that every one of those
642,700 children in Pennsylvania has
protections in place by law for pre-
existing conditions in addition to cov-
ering all of the other adults across
Pennsylvania.
Basically, it is almost one out of
every two Americans who has a pre-
existing condition. That is the rough
estimate. That is a lot of people across
the country. Some people believe, as
well as there being some credible, reli-
able estimates, that it is north of 130
million Americans. So those are the
only two numbers I will give.
The lawsuit is problematic. If that
were all, that would be bad enough, but
there are two things that are problem-
atic when it comes to healthcare. One
is that of the proposed cuts by the ad-
ministration. Now, I realize House Re-
publicans and Senate Republicans may
not agree with the President’s pro-
posal, but he is in the same party, and
his Budget Director is in the same
party, and the Congress of the United
States has to react to that budget pro-
posal.
The administration proposed a 10-
year Medicaid cut of $1.5 trillion, and
that is with a ‘‘t’’—trillion—not bil-
lion. The administration proposed a
$1.5 trillion cut to Medicaid. It pro-
posed a similar cut—or, I should say, a
comparable cut but actually a lower
number—to Medicare over 10 years of
$845 billion. You have to be able to say:
OK, if it is the case that there is a
credible replacement that provides the
identical protections and coverage that
the Affordable Care Act provided, what
would happen to healthcare if you were
to cut Medicaid by $1.5 trillion and
Medicare by $845 billion?
You have to answer those questions
if you are serious about healthcare.
Now, if you are just kind of moving
things around and having a talking
point for a campaign, maybe that is
different, but if you are serious about
healthcare and if you are serious about
coverage and if you are serious about
there being an adverse impact on kids,
on people with disabilities, and on sen-
iors, you can’t cut Medicaid by $1.5
trillion.
One way to describe Medicaid is in
the nursing home program for the mid-
dle class, in many instances. Medicaid
is not a program for someone distant
out there who is not worthy of our sup-
port and our help. Medicaid is about us.
Medicaid is who we are because we de-
cided more than 50 years ago that we
are the United States of America, and
we are the strongest country in the
world for lots of reasons. Thank good-
ness we have the strongest military,
and thank goodness we have the
strongest economy. Yet we are also the
greatest country in the world because
folks around the world have seen they
can follow our example once in a while.
They saw more than 50 years ago that
we said, if you are a child in a low-in-
come family or if you have a disability
or if you are a senior who is trying to
get into a nursing home, Medicaid is
going to help you do that. We also
passed Medicare at the same time.
So if you are serious about
healthcare, you have to be really con-
cerned about these budget cut pro-
posals by the administration.
The third and last topic on this is the
efforts undertaken by the administra-
tion, when in the midst of failing to re-
peal the Affordable Care Act and,
thereafter, the efforts to sabotage the
Affordable Care Act—and not in any
way an overstatement—when you have
an advertising budget to let people
know that they can go to the ex-
changes—not the Medicaid expansion
but the exchanges—to get healthcare
coverage and to get a subsidy to help
them purchase healthcare—maybe for
the first time, millions of people got
that opportunity, and millions still
have it—in order for folks to know
about that, to know about their eligi-
bility, to know about the benefits of
that, you have to advertise. We know
that. The administration cut the ad-
vertising budget by only 90 percent—
not quite 100 but a 90-percent cut in the
advertising budget.
There are also other ways they have
undermined and sabotaged the system.
If you are concerned about healthcare,
you have to be concerned about that
sabotage, you have to be concerned
about Medicaid and Medicare cuts, and
you have to be concerned about this
lawsuit.
We have a lot of work to do just to
protect the gains—the coverage gains
and the protection gains—that have
been hard won over many years that
benefit tens and tens of millions of
Americans. I am not sure I can put a
total number on them. So I hope those
who are rooting for this lawsuit to be
successful will have factored in all of
that when that day comes, if it were to
come, to change healthcare radically
and dramatically for the American
people.

S4962 July 22, 2019
Logan’s granddaughter wanted to pub-
licly honor his lifetime of service and
success in western Kentucky. I have
had the privilege to call John a friend
for more than three decades, and I en-
joyed reading the stories of his youth,
his early medical career, and his many
contributions to his community and
our Commonwealth.
Growing up, John’s baseball talent
was apparent at an early age. In fact,
he was still in middle school when he
caught the local high school coach’s at-
tention. As the varsity team’s catcher,
John quickly stood out. One sports re-
porter even called him the best catcher
in all western Kentucky. His skill was
matched only by his passion for the
game, even a broken elbow didn’t stop
him from playing in the 1955 State
tournament.
During his senior year of high school,
however, John began to hear a calling
to help other people. It was a drive
that took him away from the diamond
and into medical school. After grad-
uating from Western Kentucky Univer-
sity, John earned a rural medical
scholarship to study at Vanderbilt Uni-
versity. His career in medicine began
with a commitment to serve rural Ken-
tucky communities most in need.
As a doctor, John and his new wife
Jackie made a home in Sebree, KY,
where his gifts were in high demand.
Caring for Kentuckians across three
counties, John quickly honed his skills
and provided quality care to those in
need. During his time in this small
community, John learned that a physi-
cian must treat more than a patient’s
body. He began getting involved in a
number of community organizations,
and has dedicated his efforts to
projects through the years to make
Kentucky a better place.
Moving to Henderson and opening a
private family practice, John also
began working with the Henderson
Fine Arts Center, the Depot on the
Riverfront, and the YMCA. He worked
to help provide scholarships for young
people to attend college, paying for-
ward the aid he received to fund his
studies years before.
Many of Henderson’s landmarks sim-
ply wouldn’t exist without John’s lead-
ership. One of them, the Henderson
Riverwalk, gave me a chance to join
John’s team to get the project done. It
now bears a plaque recognizing his
lasting imprint on this community.
When this honor was unveiled, I was
proud to recognize his life spent work-
ing for others. As he enjoys his well-de-
served retirement, John continues to
inspire others to contribute to their
communities and improve our beloved
Commonwealth.
I would like to thank Ashton Brooks
Logan, John’s granddaughter, for shar-
ing these stories about his many
achievements. It is my pleasure to rec-
ognize my dear friend today. I ask my
Senate colleagues to join me in thank-
ing Dr. John Logan for his years of
dedication to western Kentucky, which
is better because of him.
The Gleaner in Henderson, KY, re-
cently published a profile of John’s re-
markable life. I ask unanimous consent
that the article be printed in the
RECORD.
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:
[From the Gleaner, June 15, 2019]
JOHN LOGAN WENT FROM CHASING HOME RUNS
TO MAKING HOUSE CALLS
(By Ashton Brooks Logan)
In the summer of 1950, there wasn’t much
to do in historical Edmonson County, Ken-
tucky, other than get a few local kids to-
gether and enter a baseball tournament, in
Bowling Green.
‘‘We didn’t have equipment, we didn’t have
uniforms, and we didn’t have a coach, we
just had nine guys,’’ Dr. John Logan said re-
cently.
But John’s quick arm attracted the eye of
Louis Durbin, the Brownsville High School’s
baseball coach, when the team was short a
catcher.
Logan was just in the sixth grade when
Coach Durbin gave him an offer to play on
their varsity team in 1951.
‘‘I started without a mask and I still have
the scar under my left eye to prove it,’’
Logan said. Logan’s passion for baseball,
paired with an eye for throwing out players
who stole second base, led him to play for
the Bowling Green American Legion team.
Even now, his eyes brighten and cheeks lift
with a smile as he talks about his time on
the team. He believes his claim to fame was
the 1955 state tournament when he played
three games with a broken right elbow—
without ever letting the fact on to the other
team.
‘‘I couldn’t even warm up the pitcher. I
could barely step in front of the plate and
flip it to him,’’ he said. ‘‘The coach and I had
a little plan and it was unbelievable, but it
happened.’’
To his advantage, his team had already
faced its opposition in the previous year’s
state tournament and won. He can’t remem-
ber how many runners tried to steal second
in that first go-round, but he recalls throw-
ing out every one of them.
Apparently they were still scared of
Logan’s arm.
‘‘Now tell me somethin’,’’ the opposing
coach said a little later in the hotel lobby,
after Logan’s team won the tournament. ‘‘I
don’t recall you throwin’ a single ball to sec-
ond base, you got a problem or something?’’
John simply looked at him, smiled and
said, ‘‘Well, just a broken elbow, but other
that I’m fine!’
Later that year, a sports reporter wrote in
a local paper that he believed Logan was the
best catcher in all of Western Kentucky.
Logan was at a crossroads. He had a pas-
sion to play ball but a burning drive to help
those around him.
Dr. Eugene Farmer, a family physician in
Brownsville took Logan under his wing, al-
lowing him to shadow his work at a young
age. And after transferring to Bowling Green
High School his senior year, Logan buckled
down on his studies.
A week following his graduation from
BGHS, he was enrolled in summer school at
Western Kentucky University in 1955. He
then went straight through undergraduate,
graduating in 1957 and that fall enrolled in
medical studies at Vanderbilt University.
He was on a rural medical scholarship that
clearly stated for every year he attended
school, he must spend a year in rural Ken-
tucky. So he settled in Sebree, Kentucky,
the Webster County hometown of his new
wife, Jackie Barnett Logan, and opened his
own practice.
‘‘I made house calls and took care of three
different counties . . . I admitted patients to
hospitals that were 16 miles away on a two-
lane road,’’ Logan says. ‘‘I must have aged 15
years in that period of time.’’
He recalls times that he had no idea what
he was coming up on.
Remembering a time that a woman called
him to a car accident outside of her house,
he describes jumping in his car and riding to
the scene to see a car turned over in a ditch
and hearing a child’s cries.
Working his way in the ditch, he imme-
diately saw a child’s leg hanging out of the
door and thought to himself, her limb has
been severed.
Finally, after laying the child on the bank
and checking her vitals, he looks at the
child’s face only to realize it was his second
eldest daughter, Sarah. His initial fears were
unfounded; she walked away that day with
nothing more than a few bruises.
‘‘Talk about something shocking,’’ Logan
said. ‘‘We dealt with things that you never
thought would happen.’’
After leaving his practice in Sebree in 1967,
he and Dr. Kenneth Eblen formed a partner-
ship to open a private family practice in
Henderson.
In 1986 Logan moved to hospital adminis-
tration at Methodist Hospital where he held
the position of medical director.
During his time as medical director he
started and managed the intern and resident
program among various other duties until he
retired in the spring of 2018.
Dr. Logan still has an passion for playing
ball, and those who also share a love for the
sport.
While still practicing medicine in Sebree,
he was approached by a man who was inter-
ested in baseball and wanted to better the
current field in the county. Almost 50 years
later and the baseball park is still func-
tioning, seeing hundreds and hundreds of ball
players coming through its diamonds in the
years.
‘‘I feel strongly that professional people,
too many times, in their own community use
the excuse of not helping out in community
organizations because they are too busy,’’
Logan said.
‘‘(But) these things made an impact. These
things made an impression. These things
help people’s lives. That is what you feel
good about as well as helping people, phys-
ically.’’
Logan has been deeply involved in the
community of Henderson through major
projects such as the Henderson Fine Arts
Center, the Depot on the Riverfront the
Riverwalk, the YMCA, and the Colonels to
College scholarship that ensures students
graduating from Henderson County High
School will get to attend two years of col-
lege.
According to Logan, baseball taught him
so much more than how to throw out the
runner at second base.
‘‘One of the biggest things, sugar, is dis-
cipline. Sometimes you go when you feel like
you can’t go but you’ve to do to get job done
and baseball, to me was that’’ Logan said.
‘‘It was a team effort to reach a certain
goal and my goal in life and what I went into
medicine for, was to help people. I’ve done a
lot in the community that has nothing to do
with medicine because it’s the same thing. I
think everybody owes something back and
that, I think, is a driving force.’’
Dr. Logan is now retired and resides in
Henderson with his wife Jackie. He still
serves on various charitable boards and loves
to spend time in his garden when he isn’t
busy catching crappie on Barkley Lake.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4963
July 22, 2019
TRIBUTE TO DR. CHRISTOPHER J.
SCOLESE
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, just be-
fore the July recess, the Senate con-
firmed the nomination of Dr. Chris-
topher J. Scolese to serve as Director
of the National Reconnaissance Office,
NRO. I doubt there is any individual
more qualified for the job. I supported
the nomination, but it was bittersweet
because Chris has left his post as Direc-
tor of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight
Center in Greenbelt, MD. Chris was the
longest serving Director in Goddard’s
illustrious history.
Chris is well-suited to run the NRO.
To put the matter simply, he knows
how to put stuff into space and make it
work. I will provide just one example:
the Terra mission. Chris was the
project manager. Terra was supposed
to be a 5-year Earth science mission
that has now lasted 20 years. Terra ex-
plores the connections between Earth’s
atmosphere, land, snow and ice, ocean,
and energy balance to further our un-
derstanding of our home planet.
I know the NRO is headquartered in
Virginia, but with Chris at the helm,
we Marylanders will consider it part of
our State, just as we consider the Wal-
lops Flight Facility to be part of Mary-
land. I was down at Wallops on April 17
for the successful commercial resupply
services, CRS launch to the Inter-
national Space Station and I visited
Goddard on March 4 to discuss the im-
pact of the 35-day government shut-
down and the budget picture going for-
ward with Chris and the Goddard work-
force.
Chris certainly has the academic cre-
dentials for the job. He holds a bach-
elor of science degree in electrica1 and
computer engineering from the State
University of New York at Buffalo, and
he earned a master’s degree in elec-
trical and computer engineering and a
Ph.D. in systems engineering from
George Washington University. After
Chris earned his bachelor’s degree,
ADM Hyman Rickover personally se-
lected him to serve at Naval Sea Sys-
tems Command, NAVSEA, where he
worked on the development of instru-
ment and multi-processor systems for
the U.S. Navy and the Department of
Energy. I think anyone who could pass
muster with Admiral Rickover can
handle just about anything, including
running the NRO.
Chris’s stint in the Nuclear Navy
from 1978 to 1986 was just the beginning
of a long, distinguished career in public
service. In 1987, he joined Goddard’s
Earth Science team and became Earth
Science Program Manager and Deputy
Director of Flight Projects. Later, he
moved to NASA Headquarters as Dep-
uty Associate Administrator for Space
Science for 3 years before returning to
Goddard where he rose to become Dep-
uty Director. Chris then returned to
NASA Headquarters, first as Chief En-
gineer and then as Associate Adminis-
trator, which is the top civil servant at
the Agency. He served as Acting Ad-
ministrator from January to July of
2009. He went back to Goddard, where
he became Director in 2012.
I think. that moving over to the
helm of NRO is a natural fit for Chris
since Goddard manages many of
NASA’s space telescope programs, in-
cluding the Hubble Space Telescope
and the Wide-Field Infrared Survey
Telescope, WFIRST, that have a tech-
nology heritage from NRO’s satellites.
I have enjoyed getting to know and
working with Chris over the past sev-
eral years. He developed great relation-
ships with the Maryland delegation and
with local officials. He is a subject
matter expert and an excellent man-
ager. He has an upbeat, amiable, and
collegial personality that brings out
the best in the people who work with
him. Goddard employees from
custodians and bus drivers to Nobel
laureates felt free to engage with
Chris. He listens and relates to every-
one as a colleague. Former Dodgers’
manager Leo Durocher famously said
that nice guys finish last. He didn’t
know Chris. Chris is a genuinely nice
guy who has come out on top, and de-
servedly so.
Chris instituted a culture of diversity
and inclusion at Goddard, and I am
sure he will do the same at NRO. He is
committed to inspiring the next gen-
eration. He has a great interest in
STEM and talking with students. God-
dard hosted over 500 interns every year
while Chris was Director. He routinely
referred students and young adults
whom he met to Goddard’s education
director so they could learn more
about working at Goddard. He has been
committed to early career profes-
sionals and always included their voice
in senior staff retreats. Above all,
Chris is a dedicated public servant with
the accolades and awards to prove it,
including the 2018 American Institute
of Aeronautics & Astronautics Von
Karman Award, the Presidential Rank
Award of Meritorious Executive, and
the NASA Distinguished Leadership
Medal, among many others.
Whenever we talk about public serv-
ants, it is important to mention their
spouses and other family members
whose own sacrifices enable and sup-
port that service. I would be remiss if
I failed to mention Chris’s wife,
Dianne, and their children: daughter
Jenni and her husband Mark; son Dan
and his wife Maura and their daughter
Maddie who is Chris and Dianne’s
granddaughter; daughter Lauren and
her fiancé Ian; and daughter Anna.
Chris may be from New York, and he
may live and now work in Virginia, but
we Marylanders will always consider
him as one of our own, and we are
grateful for his distinguished service to
our Nation. I have no doubt that he
will be a superb NRO Director.

TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL
BARBARA R. HOLCOMB
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I
wish to honor MG Barbara R. Holcomb
for her 32 years of service in our Armed
Forces, most notably, as the first fe-
male commanding general at the U.S.
Army Medical Research and Develop-
ment Command at Fort Detrick and
chief of the U.S. Army Nurse Corps.
Major General Holcomb grew up in the
small town of Miles City, MT, and
joined the Army Reserve Officer Train-
ing Corp, ROTC, following her first
year of nursing school at Seattle Uni-
versity. She completed her education
as a distinguished military graduate
with a bachelor of science in nursing.
She continued her exceptional career
with service to our country and contin-
ued Montana’s proud heritage of mili-
tary service and firsts in female leader-
ship.
Major General Holcomb goes above
and beyond as a leader and, as such,
was chosen to speak at the 2018 Women
in Leadership Summit at the Aberdeen
Proving Ground. She shared her experi-
ence in finding balance as a leader and
the importance of a leader getting to
know themselves and their peers. Even
though she was not allowed to serve in
a battalion commander position as a
cadet in ROTC, she became a com-
mander as a captain and commanded at
every rank thereafter. It is this com-
mitment to strong leadership and per-
sonal growth that has led her to a long
and successful career in the Army and
distinguishes her as an exceptional
Montanan.
It is not without good reason that
Major General Holcomb has received
many awards, including a Distin-
guished Service Medal, Bronze Star,
and membership in the Order of Mili-
tary Medical Merit. Between her focus
on the personal, human aspect of
healthcare, her commitment to contin-
ued education, and the selfless passion
with which she serves her country,
Major General Holcomb embodies what
it means to be an outstanding leader
and individual.
Upon her retirement, the U.S. Army
will be losing one of their most valu-
able assets; however, the example of
leadership that she has set for so many
will leave a lasting impact on the qual-
ity of this nation’s Army Nurse Corps
and, consequentlv, the quality of care
that our Nation’s soldiers will receive.
Montana is proud to call her one of our
own.
I would like to recognize Major Gen-
eral Barbara R. Holcomb, her personal
accomplishments, and contributions to
this country.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO DAVID BLOM
∑ Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise
today to recognize the career and serv-
ice of David P. Blom, who will retire
later this month after serving as the
president and CEO of OhioHealth since
2002. Under David’s leadership,
OhioHealth has grown its legacy of pro-
viding high-quality care to patients
across central Ohio, including residents
of my hometown, Mansfield.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4964 July 22, 2019
In the 17 years since David became
CEO, OhioHealth has tripled in size.
David spearheaded initiatives like the
OhioHealth Research & Innovation In-
stitute, which makes significant con-
tributions to the field of research
around new drugs, medical devices, and
procedures. His focus on installing new
technology has helped to drastically
reduce errors in medication and pa-
tient identification across the
OhioHealth system.
During David’s tenure as CEO,
OhioHealth has been named one of the
top 100 places to work by Fortune Mag-
azine for 12 consecutive years. In 2016,
David was honored with the Columbus
Award, and in 2009, he was inducted
into the Central Ohio Business Hall of
Fame. He currently serves on the
boards of the Columbus Foundation,
Columbus Downtown Development
Commission, Columbus Partnership,
Vizient, and Healthy Roster. But be-
yond all that, it is David’s commit-
ment to the communities OhioHealth
serves that truly sets him apart as a
leader.
David was instrumental in estab-
lishing Wellness on Wheels Women’s
Health, a mobile health clinic which
provides prenatal care to women in
high-risk communities. This program
has been invaluable in saving the lives
of the most vulnerable among us.
In 2015, David was selected as one of
15 members to serve on the Veterans
Affairs Commission on Care, a task
force that developed critical reforms to
veterans’ healthcare. Out of this came
the VA MISSION Act, which aims to
improve veterans’ access to effective
and timely health care. These reforms
would not have been possible without
David’s expertise and sense of service.
We are fortunate to be able to count
David among the ranks of great Ohio-
ans. His innovative leadership has
touched lives in my State and across
the Nation. I wish David all the best in
his retirement and thank him for his
years of service in central Ohio.∑
∑ Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today
I wish to recognize the career and ac-
complishments of David Blom, retiring
CEO of OhioHealth.
David began his career with
OhioHealth in 1983. Working through
various roles in the health care system,
he was named CEO of OhioHealth in
2002.
In his first year as CEO, after several
tough years with losses, David led
OhioHealth to report a $23 million prof-
it. Over the last 17 years at the helm,
he has presided over expansion in and
beyond central Ohio. OhioHealth has
nearly tripled system revenue and has
grown its central Ohio market share
while working to unite the culture of
multiple hospitals, outpatient sites,
and physician practices.
Today, OhioHealth is a $4 billion sys-
tem of 12 hospitals and more than 200
outpatient sites. The organization has
29,000 associates, 3,600 physicians, and
3,000 volunteers across 48 counties in
Ohio.
Under David’s leadership, OhioHealth
has become a major central Ohio em-
ployer and economic driver.
David also cares deeply about the
central Ohio community that he has
called home for so many years. He has
served on the boards of the Columbus
Partnership, the Columbus Downtown
Development Corporation, and the Co-
lumbus Foundation. He was also in-
strumental in creating Columbus 2020,
the economic development arm for cen-
tral Ohio.
Under David’s leadership, OhioHealth
has had a substantial positive impact
in Ohio, and I want to thank him for
his service and leadership.
I wish David the best in the next
chapter of his life.∑

TRIBUTE TO COLONEL JOEL
WARHURST
∑ Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today, I
wish to honor COL Joel Warhurst as he
relinquishes command of the Anniston
Army Depot, effective on July 25, 2019.
In July 2017, Colonel Warhurst became
the 35th commander of the depot. His
command tenure oversaw an annual
$850 million operating revenue and led
a workforce consisting of 2,800 people.
He has devoted over 20 years of loyal
service to our country and has acquired
important leadership positions and no-
table recognitions along the way.
Colonel Warhurst is a graduate of the
Dwight D. Eisenhower School for Na-
tional Security and Resource Strategy
at Fort McNair, VA. He holds a bach-
elor of science degree in industrial
technology from the Technical Univer-
sity in Cookeville, TN, and a master of
science degree in logistics management
from the Florida Institute of Tech-
nology in Melbourne, FL. He is deco-
rated with a Bronze Star Medal, which
is the fourth highest individual mili-
tary award.
Thank you, Colonel Warhurst, for
your dedication to our Nation and for a
job well done serving at the Anniston
Army Depot. Your tenure as com-
mander will be remembered by your re-
markable leadership. The commitment
you have shown during your time in
Alabama is inspiring, and your com-
mand serves as an example for Alabam-
ians, as well as Americans, from all
across the country.
I join Colonel Warhurst’s friends,
family, and colleagues in wishing him
the best of luck as he transitions into
a new chapter of his life, and I thank
him for his commitment to Alabama
and to the United States.∑

RECOGNIZING THE DAKOTA ALLI-
ANCE SOCCER CLUB’S 14U GIRLS
SOCCER TEAM
∑ Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I
wish to recognize the Dakota Alliance
Soccer Club’s 14U Girls soccer team.
On July 14, 2019, the Dakota Alliance
Soccer Club, DASC, 14U Girls won the
U.S. Youth Soccer, USYS—National
Presidents Cup in Murfreesboro, TN.
Their 1–0 overtime win over Century V
East 05 from Pennsylvania-West se-
cured South Dakota’s first ever USYS
national championship at any level or
age group.
The DASC 14U Girls went undefeated
during the 2019 National Presidents
Cup, with wins over teams from Penn-
sylvania, Texas, and California. Im-
pressively, the team did not surrender
a single goal throughout the tour-
nament, while tallying 13 goals in just
four games.
For their outstanding play through-
out the tournament, DASC players
Tessa Van Overbeke, Elsie Odney, Mia
Mullenmeister, and Hailee Christensen
were given Best 11 honors. Addition-
ally, Cambell Fisher received the Gold-
en Glove award as outstanding goal-
keeper, and midfielder Hailee
Christensen received the Golden Boot
as the competition’s top goal scorer.
The DASC 14U Girls earned their spot
at the National Presidents Cup by win-
ning the Midwest Presidents Cup, at-
taining wins over teams from Iowa,
Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin. In
May, they won the South Dakota
Youth Soccer State Cup, with a pair of
wins over the Black Hills Rapids Soc-
cer Club.
While a perfect postseason record of
11–0 is certainly notable, it is also im-
portant to highlight this team’s entire
42-member roster. As a group, these la-
dies spent considerable hours together
for practice sessions, community serv-
ice projects, and competitive tour-
naments throughout their successful
2018–2019 season.

S4970 July 22, 2019
HONORING SERGEANT MIKE
STEPHEN
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise
today to honor the service and sacrifice
of Sergeant Mike Stephen of the Stone
County Sheriff’s Office. Sergeant Ste-
phen was mortally wounded in the line
of duty on July 18, 2019.
As a veteran of the U.S. Army who
spent 20 years in law enforcement,
Mike Stephen was a true public serv-
ant. He bravely wore many of the uni-
forms we associate with serving and
protecting communities. And his work
didn’t stop in his own community; he
also advocated for his brothers and sis-
ters in blue before the Arkansas State
Legislature.
Mike’s second home was the fire sta-
tion. He started serving at the Pine-
ville Fire Department when he was 16
years old, and for the last 11 years, he
served as chief. His colleagues at the
fire department had great respect and
admiration for him. He was known as a
leader who put 110 percent into every-
thing he did.
Sergeant Stephen’s colleagues in the
sheriff’s office will remember him as a
man who led from the front and pushed
everyone to do better.
Sergeant Stephen truly was a hero.
We honor his service and sacrifice. Cer-
tainly my thoughts and prayers are
with his wife Susan, along with many
other family members, friends, and col-
leagues in the law enforcement com-
munity. I humbly offer my sincere con-
dolences as they grieve Mike’s passing.
I stand with all Arkansans in ex-
pressing our heartfelt gratitude for
Sergeant Stephen’s steadfast devotion
to serve as a law enforcement officer.
It takes a special person to put their
life on the line every day to protect our
communities. Sergeant Stephen exem-
plified what it meant to serve and pro-
tect, running toward danger as an
Army veteran, a member of the Stone
County Sheriff’s Office, and as Pine-
ville fire chief. Arkansas will be for-
ever grateful for his sacrifice.
SUMMER FOOD SERVICE PROGRAM
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, to-
day’s heat index is a brutal reminder
that we are in the height of summer.
While we all struggle to stay cool, too
many children across the country have
to deal with an additional discomfort
this time of the year—hunger.
We can’t control the temperature
outside, but we do have an opportunity
to help relieve their hunger pangs by
modernizing USDA’s Summer Food
Service Program, which offers children
from low-income families free lunch
and snacks in the summer.
The Summer Food Service Program
is hamstrung by rules that date back
to the 1960s and dictate a one-size-fits-
all approach to the problem. Because of
this, five out of six of the children who
participate in the school lunch pro-
gram during the school year miss out
on meals during the summer. The pro-
gram falls short because it is inflexi-
ble. It requires that children travel to
a central location and eat their meals
together. While this works well in
some communities, too many children
still go hungry during the summer.
More than 14 million low-income
children across the country live in
communities that are ineligible to op-
erate an open summer meals site. Even
in communities where there are sites,
access can be far from easy. Lack of
transportation and extreme weather
often keep children away. In rural
areas, where roughly 3 million low-in-
come children live, the closest site
could be several miles away.
Senator LEAHY and I are leading a bi-
partisan charge to overcome this chal-
lenge and make Federal child nutrition
programs more efficient, flexible, and
better equipped to reach children in
need. Our bill, the Hunger-Free Sum-
mer for Kids Act of 2019, brings to-
gether Senators from different regions
with views across the political spec-
trum in an effort to address this issue.
It counts the majority leader as one of
its original cosponsors, as well as Sen-
ators BROWN, HYDE-SMITH, BENNET, and
HOEVEN. I am grateful for their sup-
port. We hope to add more names to
this coalition moving forward.
The bipartisan group teamed up be-
cause we have seen the need for more
options to end hunger in our commu-
nities and share a belief that the best
solutions to this problem come from
the ground up. The changes we have
put forward come directly from the
leaders of organizations in our commu-
nities who are dedicated to ensuring
children do not go hungry during the
summertime. They have seen firsthand
how difficult these summer months are
for children who are unable to access
meals at a central location. Their ex-
pertise and ideas helped us fashion al-
ternative options to provide States
with flexibility that will help fill the
gaps where the programs fall short.
The solution proposed by the Hunger-
Free Summer for Kids Act of 2019 chan-
nels the energy and want-to of these
helpers to make the summer meals pro-
gram work for all areas of the country.
Kathy Webb, executive director of the
Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance, is
one of those leaders on the ground in
my State. She said the Hunger-Free
Summer for Kids Act of 2019 will make
a ‘‘significant difference’’ because it
‘‘provides the options families need to
overcome barriers to access nutritious
food their kids need in the summer.’’
I would stress that the organizations
that provide summer meals at central-
ized locations do an excellent job. Not
only do they supply nutritious meals
children need to ensure their develop-
ment does not suffer while out of
school, but they also provide edu-
cational and recreational activities in
a social setting. But, again, this
doesn’t work for every child in need.
Too many are falling through the
cracks. In fact, summer meals cur-
rently reach less than 20 percent of
children who participate in similar
programs during the school year.
Our bill proposes two alternative op-
tions States could utilize through the
Summer Food Service Program to
reach these kids. The first would allow
for meals to be consumed off-site
through innovative means, like mobile
feeding, and other programs, such as
the backpack meals. The other option
would authorize the summer EBT pro-
gram, which would provide eligible
families $30 per summer month per
child, with a maximum of $100 per child
per year, to purchase food from ap-
proved retailers. Summer EBT was
shown to reduce child hunger by over
30 percent in USDA pilot programs.
To my colleagues, as you plan your
itinerary for the August work period, I
encourage you to visit summer feeding
programs in your communities. Talk to
those on the frontlines of this effort
and ask them about our proposed
changes to the Summer Food Service
Program. I think you will find they
face similar challenges to those we are
seeking to overcome with the Hunger-
Free Summer for Kids Act of 2019. Au-
gust is the ideal time to see how orga-
nizations in your communities are
using the program to help those in
need and how these proposed changes
will help them increase their reach.
I yield the floor.

HONORING MELINDA WALKER ON
HER RETIREMENT AS CHIEF RE-
PORTER OF DEBATES
HON. NANCY PELOSI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, July 22, 2019
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Melinda Walker, the Chief Reporter of
Debates, on her retirement in August after
more than 20 years of outstanding service to
the House of Representatives.
Ms. Walker has brought great effectiveness
and integrity to this critical position, which has
long been vital to the transparency and acces-
sibility of Article I, the Legislative Branch, to
the American people. She carries on the long,
storied tradition of shorthand reporters of de-
bates, upon whom the House has relied for
nearly two centuries to ensure that the Peo-
ple’s House can be open and accountable to
the American people.
A proud native of Texas, Ms. Walker came
to the House in 1999 after serving as a court
reporter for the UN International Criminal Tri-
bunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania. Her
career began after graduating from the
Stenograph Institute of Texas in 1989, and her
skills took her around the country and the
world, with positions in England, the Carib-
bean, and South Africa.
Ms. Walker has led a career of great distinc-
tion in the House. She has reported both
House committee hearings and Floor pro-
ceedings, and has taken down committee tes-
timony from two Chief Justices of the United
States and three Secretaries of State, among
many others. On the Floor, Ms. Walker has re-
ported the State of the Union messages for
three Presidents as well as the speeches of
numerous foreign dignitaries during Joint
Meetings of Congress.
Upon her promotion to Chief Reporter in
2015, she led the team of court reporters and
staff in charge of the production of the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD. She has distinguished
herself by the excellence with which she has
mastered intricate parliamentary nuances of
House proceedings and by her passion for
and commitment to this institution. Among her
many contributions to the House is the legacy
she leaves through the 200-page style and
format manual that she fully revised and up-
dated for the Office of Official Reporters,
which will serve as a resource for years to
come.
Ms. Walker is recognized by the National
Court Reporters Association as a Registered
Professional Reporter, a Certified Manager of
Reporting Services, and is a Certified Short-
hand Reporter in Texas. She plans to return to
her hometown of San Saba, Texas, and spend
more time with her family and faithful hound
dog, Bleu.
Madam Speaker, Ms. Walker has joined a
long and distinguished tradition of dedicated,
nonpartisan service to the House, and I join
her staff and many others in wishing her the
very best in retirement.
COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE ‘‘APOLLO 11’’
MOON LANDING
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, July 22, 2019
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, on
July 20 our nation commemorated the 50th
Anniversary of the Moon Landing.
I remember July 20, 1969, when astronauts
Neil Armstrong and Edwin ‘‘Buzz’’ Aldrin be-
came the first humans ever to land on the
moon.
With the words ‘‘the Eagle has Landed,’’
their place in history was secured.
I hold the men and women who made that
day possible in great regard for their tireless
work to make it possible in my lifetime to see
people depart our tiny blue planet and visit an-
other world.
To young people listening today this may
sound like science fiction, but for those of us
fortunate enough to have witnessed the event
it is science fact.
Since the beginning of mankind, we have
been driven by curiosity and a wonder of what
is next for humanity.
In 1865, Jules Verne’s ‘‘From the Earth to
the Moon’’ was published.
‘‘From the Earth to the Moon,’’ was a hu-
morous science fantasy story about three
members of a post-American Civil War gun
club efforts to build a spaceship to the moon.
A little over a century later, the men and
women of NASA made that science fiction
story science fact.
People have wondered about our place in
the cosmos for as long as we have been able
to look up into the night sky and see the stars.
And of course, after witnessing the moon
landing, we have been dared by our own
sense of imagination and possibility to slip the
surly bonds of earth, ascend to the heavens.
The visionary who made this possible was
the nation’s’ youngest elected president, John
Fitzgerald Kennedy, the 36th President of the
United States of America.
His election as president fired the imagina-
tion of a nation that was redefining its role on
the world stage following World War II.
He said in his inaugural speech ‘‘Ask not
what your country can do for you, ask what
you can do for your country.’’
President Kennedy understood that for free-
dom to prosper in the world America must
lead the way and that we did not have a per-
son to waste—that we needed everyone’s tal-
ents.
Most of all, John Kennedy was a man who
never stopped thinking about tomorrow or
working to realize the full promise of America.
And he understood that we all had a place
in that future and a role to play in bringing it
about.
John Kennedy believed there was nothing
America could not achieve once it set its mind
to it.
In September 1962, President Kennedy de-
livered his famous Moon Speech at Rice Uni-
versity in the city of Houston, Texas, and com-
mitted America to send a man to the moon
and to bring him safely home before the end
of the decade.
Asked why we should go to the moon,
President Kennedy said:
‘‘We choose to go to the moon in this dec-
ade and do the other things, not because they
are easy, but because they are hard.’’
To anyone who might doubt America’s abil-
ity to make good on this commitment, Presi-
dent Kennedy said, ‘‘this country of the United
States was not built by those who waited and
rested and wished to look behind them.
‘‘This country was conquered by those who
moved forward—and so will space.’’
It is with an awe of that sense of exploration
that I commemorate the 50th Anniversary of
the Apollo 11 moon landing.
In one-fell swoop, President Kennedy har-
nessed our competitive drive and merged it
with mankind’s relentless pursuit of discovery
and information and knowledge.
‘‘It was a bold proposition, not because of
this challenge, but also because of our stand-
ing in the Space Race.
Just four years before Kennedy’s Moon
Speech, the Soviets had released Sputnik into
orbit, as the first unmanned satellite, and in
the process taken the lead in the global space
race.
Our confidence shaken, we set out to work
on the mission before us.
The 1960s were a tumultuous time in our
pursuit of the moon’s surface—Vietnam, Civil
Rights, and the Cold War vied for our atten-
tion.
A few years ago, the book ‘‘Hidden Fig-
ures,’’ about three African American women
who made significant contributions to the
space program was made into a motion pic-
ture.
Their contributions and those of hundreds of
women was revealed for the first time.
There are thousands of hidden figures who
contributed to the pinnacle of human achieve-
ment—human space flight and men walking
on the moon.
More important, it revealed the capacity of
an America absent discrimination to out-
perform the world on the most difficult of
human endeavors—landing a man on the
moon and returning him safely to Earth.
Our path to the moon was not linear and not
without setbacks.
Before we could celebrate the triumph of the
Apollo 11 crew and the valor of Neil Arm-
strong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, we
mourned the crew of Apollo 1, Gus Grissom,
Edward White, and Roger Chaffee who died
tragically during a launch test.
Before we could walk on the moon, it was
necessary first to orbit the Earth.
Indeed, the journey to Mare Tranquillitatis
was long, and a collective, national endeavor.
The challenge would be the pursuit of three
presidents until, on July 20, 1969, the crew of
Apollo 11 touched down on the Moon’s sur-
face.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E952 July 22, 2019
The words uttered by Neil Armstrong were
instantly immortalized, and can be recited by
every child, then and now: ‘‘One small step for
man, one giant leap for mankind.’’
This was a moment for joy and celebration
for the entire nation.
But for those of us from Houston, this mo-
ment is an occasion of unique pride.
The flight to the Moon, and indeed all
manned flights, have been guided by the bril-
liant and hardworking men and women work-
ing in Mission Control at the NASA Johnson
Space Center of Houston, who, for close to 60
years, have been the steady hand, guiding
manned space exploration.
I thank them for all that they do and urge all
who will hear these words to maintain that
same sense of discovery and exploration and
wonder for what lies next for us.
And, I invoke President Kennedy’s admoni-
tion to us from 58 years ago, that we should
not be motivated simply by what is easy, but
that we should meet the difficult challenge and
savor what can be accomplished by our col-
lective efforts.
Therefore—I seek out ways each day to
touch this part of American exceptionalism—
our ability to take all that we know about
science, seek out new knowledge, bring the
talents of all our people regardless of gender,
race, or ethnicity and apply our resources to
solving problems.
We can prevail against global climate
change, cure cancer, end pandemics, and
poverty—by pursuing these ends with the
same focus and determination that our nation
brought to bear in facing the challenge of
landing people on the moon.
I congratulate the men and women of NASA
past, present and future in making science fic-
tion—science fact.
Today, we celebrate our trip to the moon.
I look forward to our celebration of our na-
tion sending the first humans to Mars.

HONORING LUCINDA MARIE LOPEZ
FOR RECEIVING THE GIRL
SCOUT GOLD AWARD
HON. FILEMON VELA
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, July 22, 2019
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Lucinda Marie Lopez, who has earned
the Girl Scouts of the USA Gold Award.
Lucinda joins a select group of scouts to ob-
tain this recognition. The Gold Award symbol-
izes an individual’s outstanding accomplish-
ments in leadership, community service, ca-
reer planning, and personal development. The
award requires earning four interest project
patches, the Career Exploration Pin, the Sen-
ior Girl Scout Leadership Award, and com-
pleting the Senior Girl Scout Challenge. A
scout must also complete a Gold Project, in
which scouts identify and lead a project on a
pressing issue in the community.
Inspired by the work and leadership of Girl
Scout’s founder Juliette Low, Lucinda assem-
bled a replica of Low’s childhood home for dis-
play at Brownsville’s Holiday Village. Her
model helped to inspire our children and instill
in them values championed by the Girl Scouts.
This project required remarkable creativity and
attention to detail in order to bring an exhibit
of such magnitude to life. Additionally, she de-
signed a patch of the Holiday Village, which
her fellow Girl Scouts earn by visiting the vil-
lage.
It is a great honor to recognize Lucinda
Marie Lopez for her dedication and unwaver-
ing service. I am confident that the skills and
life lessons she learns through Girl Scouts will
prove to be invaluable in her future endeavors.
I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing
her achievements, work, and service.

WOMEN’S HISTORY HONOREE:
CATHERINE ELIZABETH MCCAR-
THY
HON. DARREN SOTO
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, July 22, 2019
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I retract the
Congressional recognition of Ms. Catherine
Elizabeth McCarthy.
Congressional recognition of one’s accom-
plishments is a solemn honor and privilege
conferred to people that have earned it
through their service to their community. Cath-
erine Elizabeth McCarthy is wholly
undeserving of this honor, as she deceived
the community about her medical credentials
and did not perform any of the actions de-
scribed in the recognition. While I understand
that I cannot make a retraction of my March
11, 2019 remarks made in the CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD, I formally submit this statement as a
substitute for my earlier comments.

HONORING COLONEL L. OMAR
LOMAS
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, July 22, 2019
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to honor Colonel L. Omar Lomas,
an Army veteran, and a dedicated community
leader. On July 18, 2019, he took command of
42D Military Police Brigade.
Colonel Lomas is a native of Texas’s 15th
Congressional District, born in McAllen, Texas.
In 1996, he graduated from Texas State Uni-
versity, formerly known as Southwest Texas
State, as a Distinguished Military Graduate
through their ROTC program, earning his
Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice. In Au-
gust 1996, Colonel Lomas enlisted and served
as an Army soldier in Operations Desert
Shield/Storm. After serving, he obtained two
Masters degrees, one in Business and Secu-
rity Administration from Webster University
and another in Strategic Studies from the U.S.
Army War College. Colonel Lomas engaged in
a variety of impressive learning opportunities
including the Military Police Officer Basic
course, the Captain’s Career course, the Com-
bined Arms Services Staff School, Command
and General Staff College, the U.S. Army War
College, the U.S. Army Air Assault and Air-
borne courses, and the Army Force Manage-
ment Course.
Colonel Lomas has honorably served in key
leadership roles in our military; serving as a
Platoon Leader to Commander for the Military
Police at Fort McClellan, Fort Polk, Fort Hood,
Fort Riley, Schofield Barracks, and in
Kandahar, Afghanistan. Colonel Lomas also
served as Operations Officer, Directorate of
Emergency Services, Fort Riley Kansas; Mili-
tary Police Observer Coach/Trainer, Mission
Command Training Program, Fort Leaven-
worth, Kansas; Deputy Director, Defense
Forensics and Biometrics Agency, Pentagon;
and Strategic Initiatives Group Chief, Office of
the Provost Marshal General, Pentagon.
Colonel Lomas has received several awards
and distinctions, including the Bronze Star
Medal (3 OLC), the Meritorious Service Medal
(4 OCL), the Joint Commendation Medal, the
Army Commendation Medal (3 OLC), the
Army Achievement Medal (3 OLC), the Na-
tional Defense Service Medal (1 Bronze Star),
the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, the
Southwest Asia Service Medal (3rd Bronze
Star), the Afghanistan and Iraqi Campaign
Medals, the Global War on Terrorism Expedi-
tionary and Service Medals, the Liberation of
Kuwait Medal, the Defense of Saudi Arabia
Medal, the Order of the Marechaussee
(Bronze), the Combat Action, Air Assault and
Parachutist’s badges, and the Army Staff

Madam Speaker, Colonel L. Omar Lomas
has dedicated his life to defending our country
and the freedoms we hold dear. It is an honor
to represent a hero who has exemplified lead-
ership, scholarship, and selfless service.
There is no doubt in my mind that Colonel
Lomas will excel with 42D Military Police Bri-
gade. I wish Colonel L. Omar Lomas, his wife
Edtna Georgina Garcia, and his children
Maria, Miguel, Mateo, and Diego the best in
their future endeavors.

HONORING THE MOYE FAMILY’S
COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITY
AND FAMILY
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, July 22, 2019
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the rich history of
the Moye Family and their commitment to
maintaining the values of loyalty and commu-
nity.
Jacqueline Johnson, a constituent and Buf-
falo resident who worked for many years in
the Buffalo Public School District, brought the
Moye family history to my attention as they
gather in Buffalo to celebrate their 39th annual
family reunion.
The Moye family history begins in South
Carolina, with the marriage of Ezra Moye to
Sarah Howard. This union produced six chil-
dren, Willis, Sonny, Ezra Moye Jr., aka ‘‘Bud’’,
Millie, Rachel, and Margaret. From these six
children, the Moye family has grown exponen-
tially.
The firstborn in the next generation of
Moye’s is Lawrence Moye, the son of Willis
and Mattie. Prior to Lawrence’s birth, all pre-
vious Moye ancestors had lived under the
crushing burden of slavery. In 1865, Lawrence
was freed from slavery, and in his first display
of true freedom he chose to marry two weeks
later. His love for his new wife Charlotte was
unbounded by slavery, and he seized this op-
portunity to benefit the generations of his fam-
ily to come.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E953
July 22, 2019
Willis, Sonny, Ezra, Millie, Rachel, and Mar-
garet endured the unspeakable hardships of
slavery. Even after slavery was legally abol-
ished, injustices in education, employment,
and law enforcement have had an impact on
African Americans in our society. Despite this,
communities of strength and virtue have pre-
vailed, as we bear witness today at this Moye
family reunion.
While this is the 39th annual Moye family
reunion, it is the first one being held in Buffalo,
and the city is honored to be the site of cele-
bration for a family with such rich history and
traditions. Family members descending from
Eugene and Minnie, Daisy and Joseph, and
Georgia and Neb live in Buffalo today. Moye
family members began moving to Western
New York as early as the 1930’s, and thanks
to the Moye Family Historian, Gregory Moye,
we are able to recount some aspects of the
family history today.
The Moye family is the embodiment of a vir-
tuous family with a rich history of obstacles
that ultimately led to great perseverance and
triumph. Family members from all around the
country have traveled and sacrificed to be
here today, for the simple and beautiful reason
of celebrating family with one another. Buffalo
is honored to have been called home for many
members of the Moye family and I would ask
my colleagues to join me in extending a warm
welcome to each member of the Moye family
and extend our best wishes for an enjoyable
successful celebration this year and for gen-
erations to come.

HONORING ANDREA AGUILAR FOR
RECEIVING THE GIRL SCOUT
GOLD AWARD
HON. FILEMON VELA
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, July 22, 2019
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Andrea Aileen Aguilar, who has earned
the Girl Scouts of the USA Gold Award.
Andrea joins a select group of scouts to ob-
tain this recognition. The Gold Award symbol-
izes an individual’s outstanding accomplish-
ments in leadership, community service, ca-
reer planning, and personal development. The
award requires earning four interest project
patches, the Career Exploration Pin, the Sen-
ior Girl Scout Leadership Award, and com-
pleting the Senior Girl Scout Challenge. A
scout must also complete a Gold Project, in
which scouts identify and lead a project on a
pressing issue in the community.
For her Gold Project, Andrea installed a bi-
cycle rack and a repair station with sidewalks
and landscaping at the National Historical
Park—Resaca De La Palma Battlefield in
Brownsville, Texas. Andrea worked with local
businesses to secure labor and material. I am
proud of her work ethic and ability to improve
community access to an historic landmark
through this project.
It is a great honor to recognize Andrea
Aileen Aguilar for her dedication and unwaver-
ing service. I am confident that the skills and
life lessons she learns through Girl Scouts will
prove to be invaluable in her future endeavors.
I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing
her achievements, work, and service.
RAISE THE WAGE ACT
SPEECH OF
HON. DAVID B. McKINLEY
OF WEST VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, July 18, 2019
Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, working Amer-
icans are rightfully concerned with their sala-
ries and wages. H.R. 582, the ‘‘Raise the
Wage Act’’ was an attempt to address this
issue by increasing the minimum wage up to
$15/hour. Unfortunately, this is not the right
approach. The nonpartisan Congressional
Budget Office (CBO) stated that this could re-
sult in the loss of up to 3.7 million jobs.
Incremental increases in the federal min-
imum wage are appropriate, and I was proud
to support West Virginia’s recent increase of
the minimum wage to $8.75/hour. But the fact
is, H.R. 582 did not account for regional dif-
ferences in cost of living. $15/hour may work
for places like Manhattan and San Francisco
but would devastate small businesses in the
Mountain State.
Further, such a drastic increase in the min-
imum wage would harm those workers that
this bill claims to help. CBO has estimated
that of the millions of jobs lost, 46 percent will
be young workers and 38 percent will be
those without a high school diploma. For every
person lifted out of poverty by this bill, another
1 to 3 jobs would be put at risk.
If Democrats in Congress are serious about
addressing issues surrounding the minimum
wage, they should have proposed legislation
that accounts for regional factors and slowly
increases it to a more reasonable level, in-
stead of pushing a one size fits all 107 per-
cent increase nationwide. Unfortunately, this
legislation would have been unworkable for
West Virginia and I was given no other choice
but to oppose it.

TRIBUTE TO DR. SUZANNE EATON
HON. DENVER RIGGLEMAN
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, July 22, 2019
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Madam Speaker, our
hearts are heavy as we mourn the loss of Dr.
Suzanne Eaton, an American biologist who
was murdered in Greece on July 2nd. Dr.
Eaton worked at the Max Planck Institute at
Dresden University in Germany, where she
was a leader in the field of molecular biology.
Her colleagues described her as a woman
with an insatiable curiosity and a humble, lov-
ing heart.
The legacy she leaves behind is not one of
sorrow. Instead, it is a legacy of discovery. Dr.
Eaton’s work advanced our understanding of
the building blocks of life, and in doing so,
provided an invaluable contribution to the un-
derstanding of humankind. For this, and for
her, we are grateful.
Today, it is my hope that we can remember
here in this chamber her work, her life, and
her legacy.

HON. FILEMON VELA
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, July 22, 2019
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Abigail Elizabeth Rocha, who has
earned the Girl Scouts of the USA Gold
Award.
Abigail joins a select group of scouts to ob-
tain this recognition. The Gold Award symbol-

ments in leadership, community service, ca-
reer planning, and personal development. The

patches, the Career Exploration Pin, the Sen-
ior Girl Scout Leadership Award, and com-
pleting the Senior Girl Scout Challenge. A
scout must also complete a Gold Project, in
which scouts identify and lead a project on a

For her Gold Project, Abigail built five librar-
ies, three in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico
and two in Brownsville, Texas. An avid reader,
Abigail excelled in her goal of providing both
communities with access to books. I applaud
her vision and ambition as she diligently
worked on both sides of our border to get the
communities involved in this project. Her
imagination and leadership helped improve
educational opportunities for children and fam-
ilies.
It is a great honor to recognize Abigail Eliza-
beth Rocha for her dedication and unwavering

lessons she learns through Girl Scouts will
prove to be invaluable in her future endeavors.
I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing

HONORING THE CAREER OF JUDY
SCHNEIDER
HON. ZOE LOFGREN
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Monday, July 22, 2019
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor Judy Schneider who is retiring
from the Congressional Research Service
after over forty years of service on Capitol Hill.
Last year, when Judy Schneider received a
lifetime achievement award from the Congres-
sional Management Foundation, the Roll Call
article on the event stated that ‘‘hundreds of
members of Congress know how to legislate
because Judy Schneider taught them.’’ If any-
thing, that does not capture the extent and
depth of Judy Schneider’s influence on Con-
gress and the legislative process.
Judy, who received both Bachelor’s and
Master’s degrees from American University
has also worked for the Senate Ethics Com-
mittee, the Senate Select Committee to Study
the Senate Committee System, and the House
Commission on Administrative Review. She
has been with CRS since 1979. She has also
been active with Women in Government Rela-
tions, who recognized and honored her work
through their program ‘‘Direct Connect to Con-
gress’’ series by creating a fellowship in her
name.
Congress depends on rules and precedents,
decades and sometimes centuries old. We, as
legislators, must rely upon guides and path-
finders to navigate the legislative process and
to make sure that the institution operates as it
should. There have been few, if any, guides
and pathfinders as instrumental in serving this
institution and in lighting the way for all of us
to assist us in working to ensure that this na-
tion meets the challenge of its promise.
I thank Judy Schneider for her years of
service to all of us and wish her the very best
in her retirement.

Monday, July 22, 2019
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Kathryn Thalia Leos, who has earned
the Girl Scouts of the USA Gold Award.
Kathryn joins a select group of scouts to ob-
tain this recognition. The Gold Award symbol-
izes an individual’s outstanding accomplish-
ments in leadership, community service, ca-
reer planning, and personal development. The
award requires earning four interest project
patches, the Career Exploration Pin, the Sen-
ior Girl Scout Leadership Award, and com-
pleting the Senior Girl Scout Challenge. A
scout must also complete a Gold Project, in
which scouts identify and lead a project on a
pressing issue in the community.
Kathryn’s project, ‘‘Kat’s Closet,’’ focused on
meeting the professional-attire needs of stu-
dents at South Texas Academy for Medical
Professions. The school serves as an alter-
native to larger high schools of local inde-
pendent school districts for students interested
in pursuing careers in health care. Equipping
our next generation of leaders is critical as
they embark on their careers. Kathryn’s work
has made a lasting, positive impact on the
lives of many.
It is a great honor to recognize Kathryn
Thalia Leos for her dedication and unwavering
service. I am confident that the skills and life
lessons she learns through Girl Scouts will
prove to be invaluable in her future endeavors.
I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing
her achievements, work, and service.
