PRAYER
Pastor Deamon Scapin, Triumph
Church DC, Washington, D.C., offered
the following prayer:
Father of all nations, release Your
power to heal our Nation.
We know that You see everything,
even secret and hidden things. God of
Heaven, let truth reign. Let what is
done in secret be shouted from the
housetops. Bring justice and righteous-
ness to this House. Forgive us when
pride, selfishness, and greed have been
the motivators for evil behavior. We
seek Your face today, believing that
You will heal our fractured system and
expose all dishonesty.
Bind the lying spirit of Satan and re-
move corruption, falsehood, and bias.
Let discernment rule and wisdom per-
meate our decision makers. Reveal
what needs to be revealed and cover
what needs to be covered. May a spirit
of unity and harmony come over both
Chambers of Congress. Silence the
voices of contention and division, am-
plify voices of healing and progress for
Your glory and the good of this land.
In the name of Jesus, we pray.
Amen.

RECOGNIZING EUGENE P. VUKELIC
FOR HIS SERVICE TO OUR COUN-
TRY AND COMMUNITY
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Eugene P. Vukelic, a
business leader who has devoted his life to
service, giving back again and again to the
people of Western New York.
Gene joined the United States Marine Corps
in September of 1955 and served active duty
with the United States Marine Corps 3rd Ma-
rine Division. He was stationed in Japan, rose
to the rank of Corporal, and continued his mili-
tary service until his discharge in April of
1963.
Following his military service, Gene became
president of Try-It Distributing Co., Inc. in
1960, when he took over the company from
his father, Stephen. The company originated
as a small beer distributor with 12 stake-
holders in the late 1920s, and today has over
625 stakeholders and serves Western New
York clients from a state-of-the-art sales and
service center in Lancaster, New York. Try-It
Distributing is the exclusive Western New York
distributor of Budweiser beer and related An-
heuser-Busch products, and now includes
subsidiaries Balkan Beverage and Saratoga
Eagle Sales & Service. Try-It is the largest
distributor of Labatt products worldwide. Gene
has now been with Try-It for more than six
decades.
Gene and his wife Carole Rose were mar-
ried in 1958, and are parents to eight children,
including six sons: Gregory (who passed away
in 1981), Paul, Tim, Matt, Jeff and Peter; and
two daughters Mary Ellen Sullivan and Su-
zanne Mahoney. Four sons work for Try-It,
continuing the company’s family legacy that
has now spanned three generations.
Gene’s focus has always been to give back
to our community. He has contributed an ex-
tensive amount of volunteer leadership over
the course of his career. Not-for-profit agen-
cies, institutions and charities including Mus-
cular Dystrophy Association, Nardin Academy,
Canisius College, Roswell Park Cancer Insti-
tute, Our Lady of Victory Services, in addition
to Father Baker Charities have all benefited
from Gene’s generosity.
Gene is the recipient of numerous profes-
sional and civic awards and recognitions for
his leadership of Try-It and his civic endeav-
ors. Gene was awarded the Caritas Award
from the St. Joseph’s Hospital Foundation in
2003, recognized as Humanitarian of the Year
from Hope of Tomorrow in 2008, and was the
recipient of the Buffalo Niagara Business Eth-
ics Award in 2018. In 2019, Gene was in-
ducted into the Buffalo Business Hall of Fame.
Gene has also served as president of several
local organizations, including Mercy Hospital
Foundation Board of Trustees and the Buffalo
Executives Association.
Madam Speaker, I recognize an honorable
military veteran and a pillar of our community,
Eugene P. Vukelic, and I hope that you and
our colleagues will join in honoring Gene for
his lifetime of service to the people of Western
New York.

HONORING MAJ. CARL A.
NUNZIATO
HON. TIM RYAN
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Maj. Carl A. Nunziato, for his continued
work to assure veterans in the Youngstown
area have access to the treatment they de-
serve.
Maj. Carl A. Nunziato proudly served his
country during two tours in Vietnam. During
his first volunteer tour he served as a senior
lieutenant commander of door gunners over
300 men located in seven locations throughout
Vietnam; Nunziato also secured air bases and
camp perimeters during this first tour as an in-
telligence officer and commander. Nunziato
went on to serve as an artillery battery com-
mander with the 25th Division and then re-
turned to Vietnam to assist infantry in Ku-Chi.
In 1966, during his second tour, he fought in
Operation Adelborough, but near the comple-
tion of this operation he was struck by a mor-
tar which resulted in the amputation of both
his legs and a 23-month stay at the Walter
Reed Hospital in recovery.
Nevertheless, Maj. Nunziato did not allow
this event to derail his life. Returning home a
hero, he chose to pursue an education and
graduated from Case Western Reserve Uni-
versity’s School of Law in 1971. He went on
to work in law and served nearly 30 years in
the banking industry.
As a result of his injuries, Maj. Nunziato be-
came an advocate for veterans with disabil-
ities. His efforts to assure that all veterans re-
ceived adequate care in the Youngstown Area
helped lead to the establishment of the Vet-
erans Outpatient Clinic on Youngstown’s North
Side in the early 1990s. This clinic now serves
about 45,000 veterans annually, and to this
day Nunziato continues to work tirelessly. The
Department of Veterans Affairs recently an-
nounced the construction of a new, larger,
35,000-square-foot clinic near the old clinic. In
May 2018, the Veterans Resource Center on
Wick Avenue in Youngstown was renamed in
his honor and he also helped to establish the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Youngstown’s
Central Square which commemorates the 104
Mahoning County soldiers who lost theirs lives
during the war.
I am proud that Maj. Nunziato is a con-
stituent of my district. The work he has done
has been invaluable to our community and he
has contributed an immense amount to the
people of Youngstown through his service in
both military and in the community.
I thank Maj. Nunziato for his service to our
community and wish him the best of luck in
his future efforts to assure the veterans and
residents of Youngstown with disabilities re-
ceive the attention they deserve.

RECOGNIZING THE ASIAN
AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with
sincere admiration that I recognize the Asian
American Medical Association, which will host
its 43rd Annual Gala on Saturday, November
9, 2019, at Avalon Manor in Merrillville, Indi-
ana. Each year, the Asian American Medical
Association pays tribute to prominent, out-
standing citizens and organizations for their
contributions to the community. In recognition
of their efforts, these honorees are awarded
the prestigious Crystal Globe Award.
The Asian American Medical Association
has been a tremendous asset to Northwest In-
diana. Its members have dedicated them-
selves to providing quality medical services to
the residents of Northwest Indiana and have
served their communities through many cul-
tural, scholastic, and charitable endeavors.
At this year’s Annual Gala, the Asian Amer-
ican Medical Association will present the Crys-
tal Globe Award to one of Northwest Indiana’s
finest citizens, Dr. William J. Pierce.
Dr. William Pierce’s career in the medical
field has been remarkable and noteworthy.
After graduating from the University of Illinois
College of Medicine, Dr. Pierce joined the
Medical Corps of the United States Army,
where he served proudly and reached the
rank of captain. Subsequently, in 1973, he
opened his private practice, Pierce Medical
Clinic, which has been very successful and re-
mains in operation today. During his illustrious
career, Dr. Pierce has remained active in the
medical community throughout Northwest Indi-
ana, practicing at Community Hospital, Meth-
odist Hospital, Saint Mary’s Hospital, Saint
Catherine’s Hospital, Saint Anthony’s Hospital,
and Pinnacle Hospital. He also played a major
role in the establishment and development of
Pinnacle Hospital in Crown Point. In addition,
he has served on numerous hospital and med-
ical boards, chairing many of them. Dr.
Pierce’s expertise and leadership is highly re-
spected, and he continues to go above and
beyond for the healthcare community through-
out the region. While his commitment to medi-
cine and to his patients is most impressive,
Dr. Pierce has also given much of his time
and efforts to numerous charitable organiza-
tions in Northwest Indiana, and he has been
very active in the Rotary Club for many years.
For his dedication and important work, Dr.
Pierce is to be commended.
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my
other distinguished colleagues join me in com-
mending the members of the Asian American

HONORING THE ACCOMPLISH-
MENTS OF NORMA MALONE
COOK
HON. MARCY KAPTUR
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to recognize the accomplishments of Norma
Malone Cook of Huron, Ohio. On Sunday, No-
vember 17, 2019, the Huron United Methodist
Church will honor Norma for 50 years of serv-
ice to their congregation.
Norma began playing the organ at age 15
for the Huron United Methodist Church on
September 14, 1969.
Norma tells the story of the night that her
parents dropped her off at the church to prac-
tice music and forgot to pick her up. She re-
called the darkness and the sounds of the
heat registers, and, there being no telephone
near the choir loft, Norma just waited at the
back door until her apologetic father showed
up around midnight. Despite that event,
Norma continued to serve her church with a
smile.
There have been many changes at the
Huron United Methodist Church during the
time that Norma has served, and she has im-
provised and changed alongside the church.
One such change that marked the end of an
era was in 1995, when the Hemry Organ
Company increased the organ from 7 to 11
ranks, which made the organ four feet higher
and moved to another location. Previously, the
organist was in a sunken pit and could not see
the activity of the sanctuary aisles. The organ-
ist relied on taking cues from the minister as
to when music should commence or end,
making it extremely difficult to play for a wed-
ding as one could not see the bride walking
down the aisle. Norma and Rev. Carothers
formulated a communication strategy during
his ministry by which the Reverend would
crack open the parlor folding doors to bare the
light. He would switch the light on and off as
the cue for Norma to start the Wedding March.
The wedding observers in the pew never sus-
pected anything.
Over the decades, Norma has brought over
300 brides down the aisle for weddings and
comforted more than 400 families with funeral
music.
An active member of the Huron United
Methodist Church congregation, Norma works
with choirs of all ages and serves on multiple
church committees. She always brings a
sense of humor to choir rehearsals and helps
make music fun for all who work with her or
hear her play.
Norma has played ecumenical services at
almost every church in Huron, serving as an
asset to the entire Huron community.
Norma has been married to her husband
Ron for over 35 years. Norma has three chil-
dren and three grandchildren.
We congratulate Norma on all her accom-
plishments and dedication to her service to the
Huron United Methodist Church and the entire
Huron community.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ROBERT
ERNEST SCHAEFER
HON. RUSS FULCHER
OF IDAHO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mr. FULCHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the life of Robert Schaefer of
Nampa, Idaho. An astute thinker, Robert used
his passion for liberty to advocate for the fun-
damental principles of our divinely inspired
constitution and form of government we enjoy
as Americans. For 28 years, Bob, as most
called him, attentively represented his con-
stituents in the Idaho Legislature as a man of
honor, integrity, and resounding character.
Colleagues described him as a deliberate law-
maker, a diligent friend, and an honest critic of
bad policy. In his spare time, Bob was pas-
sionate about modifying and rebuilding several
Ford Thunderbirds—an icon that will always
remind us of him. This year, Bob and his wife,
Betty, celebrated their 54th wedding anniver-
sary. As a follower of Christ, his faith was
ever-more present when he was diagnosed
with a terminal illness that ultimately claimed
his life. Despite being away from the Idaho
Legislature in his later years, he would still
write letters to the editor, engage with other
local officials, and work to protect the Con-
stitution. Bob kept every piece of correspond-
ence he ever received in the Idaho Legisla-
ture, and fondly enjoyed the time he was
given to make a difference as a defender of
liberty. I honor the passion of this great Ida-
hoan, a humble, caring individual, dear to so
many in Idaho. Bob will be missed by many,
and remembered by all as a friend of freedom.

HONORING HY-VEE AS A 2019 COM-
MUNITY OUTREACH AWARD WIN-
NER
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE
OF IOWA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
celebrate, honor, and thank Hy-Vee and Hy-
Vee employees in my district. For those not
from the Midwest, you might not know the
name of the grocery store with a helpful smile
in every aisle. That’s why I’m here today to let
this Chamber know about the important and
valuable work that Hy-Vee has done to sup-
port Iowans.
In March this year, Iowa was hit with severe
flooding. Entire communities were underwater,
homes destroyed, farm land ruined, and
Iowans wondering how they were going to re-
cover. For some Iowa residents, the flooding
was so catastrophic that they had to flee their
houses with only the clothes on their back.
The situation was dire and tragic for all those
impacted.
Hy-Vee stepped in during this difficult time
to address the immediate food and water
needs of these communities. They filled 8
semi-trucks with bottled water to make sure
that those who were impacted had fresh,
clean water. And they didn’t stop with just do-
nations. They helped raise money for these
communities. They held a monthlong cam-
paign and let their customers chip in to do-
nate. They raised nearly $158,000 dollars—
and then Hy-Vee pitched in an additional
$50,000. This money is helping Iowan families
recover and rebuild.
So it’s not a surprise that Hy-Vee was
picked as a 2019 Winner for the Community
Outreach Award for their work to address food
insecurity issues and help Iowans get back on
their feet. I’m proud to have such a great com-
pany in my district, working to help their com-
munity.
Congratulations again to Hy-Vee and all
their employees for their tremendous work on
behalf of Iowa.

HONORING SAINTS CYRIL AND
METHODIUS PARISH ON ITS
135TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the 135th anniversary of Saints Cyril
and Methodius Parish in Lemont, Illinois. On
Sunday, November 3rd, the church held a
celebration to commemorate their long history
of faith and service to the community, and I
am pleased to join them.
Founded in 1884, Saints Cyril and
Methodius Parish has remained an unwaver-
ing example to our local community. Father
Leopold Bonaventura Maria Moczygemba es-
tablished this parish at the direction of the
Archbishop of Chicago, the Most Reverend
Patrick Augustine Feehanas. Saints Cyril and
Methodius became a place of worship to serve
the spiritual and cultural needs of Lemont’s
growing Polish-American community.
Father Witusik, who was assigned as an as-
sociate pastor in 1979, founded the Polish
Club of Lemont and helped introduce a Polish
Mass at Saints Cyril and Methodius to better
serve the Polish-speaking parishioners. To this
clay, the parish continues to support the Pol-
ish community and its heritage.
In the 135 years since Father Moczygemba
presided over the first mass, Saints Cyril and
Methodius Parish has undergone many ren-
ovations and improvements to accommodate
its ever-growing congregation. In 1898 and
1928, tragic fires struck Saints Cyril and
Methodius. Each time the parishioners banded
together to ensure that the church was rebuilt.
This endeavor required hard work, commit-
ment, and sincerity, all unifying characteristics
of the church’s parishioners.
What has remained constant through all the
changes is the commitment of Saints Cyril and
Methodius’s parishioners to come together
and work towards the fulfillment of their faith
and the betterment of their community. This
hard work has not gone unnoticed by the local
community who benefit from the services that
the church provides. The parish has a Ministry
of Care which provides prayer, comfort, and
healing to those who are unable to physically
attend Mass. Father Stawiarski and his con-
gregation also organize the Helping Hands
program to distribute food items and other
products to those in need.

In addition to the Parish, Saints Cyril and
Methodius School serves our community and
provides the children of Lemont an opportunity
for an outstanding Catholic education. The
school has been honored with the prestigious
2019 U.S. Department of Education National
Blue Ribbon School Award. In 1982, the De-
partment of Education established the National
Blue Ribbon Schools Program to recognize a
select group of public and private schools with
high or significantly improved achievement. I
am proud that Saints Cyril and Methodius
School has been honored as one of these ex-

lating the Parish on its many accomplish-
ments. May Saints Cyril and Methodius con-

IN RECOGNITION OF THE OPENING
OF THE IHA HEALTH CENTER
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the opening of the IHA
community health center. The new facility will
transform patients’ access to health care and
improve the lives, health, and well-being of
many within the Ypsilanti community. This en-
deavor is worthy of commendation.
Eastern Michigan University (EMU) is the
cornerstone of Ypsilanti. Founded in 1849,
EMU is renowned for its distinguished pro-
grams that not only provide students a stellar
higher education, but also have a significant
community impact. Over the span of 170
years, EMU has demonstrated a clear commit-
ment to this mission, striving to find new ways
to serve the EMU community and beyond.
The launch of the new health center exem-
plifies EMU’s continued dedication to strength-
ening the Ypsilanti community and represents
the culmination of years of work between EMU
and other community health care providers.
Thanks to the collaboration of EMU, Saint Jo-
seph Mercy Health System, and IHA, the new
health facility will provide high-quality and in-
novative health care services to members of
the Ypsilanti community, as well as EMU stu-
dents, faculty, and staff. The state-of-the-art
facility will offer comprehensive health care
and 7-day-a-week urgent care services,
among a host of other critical services and
tools that will improve patients’ health care ex-
periences. The IHA community health center
will be an important resource to many,
strengthening health care offerings for both
residents and students alike.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring and celebrating the opening of
the new IHA health center on the EMU cam-
pus. It is critical that health care providers
adapt to meet the changing medical needs of
communities nationwide, and I am grateful for
Eastern Michigan University’s, Saint Joseph
Mercy Health System’s, and IHA’s continued
commitment to this cause. Their advocacy and
efforts help provide quality, accessible, and af-
fordable health care to patients community-
wide, truly making a meaningful impact in their
lives.

HONORING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF MERCED IRRIGATION
DISTRICT
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Merced Irrigation District (MID) on the
occasion of their 100th anniversary. Since its
founding, MID has provided water and power
to many Merced, California residents and
farmers in the greater Merced region.
MID began in 1919 when the community
voted to establish its own public irrigation dis-
trict. In 1922, MID purchased the Crocker
Huffman Land and Water Company irrigation
system and subsequently chose the Excheq-
uer Mining Company on the Merced River as
the ideal location to construct their first dam.
Once constructed, Exchequer Dam allowed for
storage of 281,000 acre-feet of water.
MID was looking to expand in the 1950s
and began planning for more water storage. In
1964 the Federal Power Commission granted
a license for MID to expand irrigation and
power facilities on the Merced River. During
this time, Pacific Gas and Electric Company
entered into a contract with MID to sell all
electricity produced by the project, which al-
lowed them to finance it with no additional
fees on taxpayers or growers. When com-
pleted, the New Exchequer Dam increased
Lake McClure’s storage to 1,024,600 acre-
feet. By 1967, MID completed New Exchequer
and McSwain Dams, enabling them to
produce tens of thousands of megawatt hours
of electricity while increasing their water stor-
age.
In 1970, improvements to areas behind the
dams at Lakes McClure and McSwain were
completed, allowing them to become popular
public recreational facilities. During the same
time period, MID undertook initiatives to im-
prove its fisheries and in the 1980s, renovated
the Lake Yosemite Dam and launched the
Double-Barreled LeGrande Replacement
Project.
Today, Merced Irrigation District provides
water to 2,200 local farmers, produces clean
renewable energy, replenishes groundwater
and helps protect the quality of groundwater,
and provides multiple recreation facilities to
the public. Due to the investments and deci-
sions made early on, MID continues to be a
regional leader in water and energy.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring the Merced Irrigation District
during their centennial year celebration. It is
both fitting and appropriate that we honor and
recognize the significant impact they’ve had
on the development of Merced and its outlying
communities.
HONORING UNITED HEBREW OF
NEW ROCHELLE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, it is an honor
to recognize an institution in my district, United
Hebrew of New Rochelle, as it celebrates its
remarkable 100th anniversary this year.
Founded in 1919 as The United Home for
Aged Hebrews, the home quickly grew over its
first decade to include 51 elderly men and
women in need in a large two-story frame
house surrounded by three park-like acres on
Pelham Road in New Rochelle. In 1934, a
three-story, red-brick addition to the original
building was made possible by a generous
contribution from Adolph Arber. The United
Home was at that time the largest institution of
its kind in Westchester County with 155 resi-
dents.
In 1954, ground was broken for a $1.5 mil-
lion building to replace the original house and
1934 wing. The new development, the Saul
and Ada Gutner Pavilion, opened 3 years later
and this new 102-bed facility was hailed as
‘‘an entirely new concept in living for the elder-
ly in need and the first major departure from
the institutional atmosphere of the traditional
old age home.’’ The building incorporated the
newest architectural concepts with modem so-
cial thought. In 1976, the Lola and Saul Kra-
mer Pavilion, a $5.25 million skilled-nursing fa-
cility, was built with the assistance of a mort-
gage loan from the New York State Medical
Care Facilities Finance Agency. The four-story
building brought the United Home to a 270-
bed capacity.
From there, United Home continued to
grow. In 1983 it launched a Long-Term Home
Health Care Program. In 1996, AZOR Li-
censed Home Health Care was launched, ex-
tending our award-winning services into the
community to serve those who chose to stay
in their own home. In 2003, the Beverly and
Alfred J. Green Pavilion—Willow Towers As-
sisted Living—opened its doors. And in 2009,
in its 90th year, United Hebrew Geriatric Cen-
ter was renamed United Hebrew. The new
name and logo honored their founders while
reflecting the essence of United Hebrew’s
comprehensive services: united for its resi-
dents, caregivers, and their families.
Madam Speaker, this is the 100-year legacy
of United Hebrew: a dedication to caring for
those in need. As we mark this special occa-
sion, I want to congratulate and thank the
leadership and team at United Hebrew for
serving our community with great distinction
for a century.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY
OF JAMES C. BOHAN
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO
OF CONNECTICUT
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is with
the heaviest of hearts that I rise today to re-
member and pay tribute to my dear friend,
James Bohan, who was taken from us much
too soon as he lost his hard-fought battle with
cancer. I am heartbroken for his wife Janice,
and his two children, Jim Jr. and Jennifer. Jim
was one of a kind and I, like all those fortu-
nate enough to have known him, will miss
him.
If there were two things you knew about Jim
Bohan, it was that he ‘‘worked for the City’’ for
too many years to count and that he was
enormously proud of his Irish heritage. Jim
had a story for any occasion, with most of
them starting ‘‘when I worked for the City
. . .’’ and the rest of them some adventure or
antic that had ensued at ‘‘the Parade.’’ He
was a storyteller and would impart his knowl-
edge to anyone willing to listen.
Jim dedicated his professional life to hous-
ing and community development. He began
his career at the New Haven Redevelopment
Agency as an Administrative Assistant with the
Hill Project Office where he served as a liai-
son between federal officials and the City and
developed planning proposals for neighbor-
hood schools, housing, and parks. He went on
to spend nearly a decade at the organization
as a Development Officer where he was re-
sponsible for monitoring construction projects
across the City as well as liaising with state
and local elected officials and community
groups. In 1976, he began his career with the
City of New Haven as the Coordinator of the
Neighborhood Preservation Program. Jim
would eventually go on to serve in the City’s
Development Administration where he was
really a jack-of-all-trades. He was the Coordi-
nator of Protocol, organizing major public
events around the City; a liaison between var-
ious City Departments and local engineering
firms; and the manager of the site selection
process for the City Infill Housing Program to
name just a few. It was from the Development
Administration that Jim retired from City serv-
ice in 1990.
Jim’s retirement from the City turned out to
be one of my most fortunate opportunities.
Having been elected to my first term in the
United States Congress, I found myself in
search of trusted staff who would be able to
manage the volumes of constituent services
that were in demand. Jim was one of the first
members of my staff. From his long history
with the City of New Haven, Jim was not only
familiar with the City at its heart but also with
neighboring communities that made up Con-
necticut’s 3rd Congressional District. Over the
decade Jim worked with me, we spent count-
less hours traveling to events and meeting
across the District. He became so much more
than a staff member and friend—he became
family. And though he left the Congressional
office in 2002, he stayed in touch through fre-
quent visits and passing on a variety of con-
stituent requests.
As I mentioned, Jim was extraordinarily
proud of his Irish heritage and he made every
effort to celebrate and share his heritage with
everyone he knew. Nothing demonstrates that
more than his dedication to the Greater New
Haven St. Patrick’s Day Parade—the City’s
annual tribute to all things Irish. Jim was a
dedicated member of the parade committee
for many years and served as Grand Marshal
in 1981. He went on to serve as the Parade’s
Executive Chairman for nearly a decade and,
even after stepping down from the Executive
Committee, Jim served as the Parade Coordi-
nator—perhaps the most thankless of jobs—
for a number of years. Even after he and Jan-
ice bought a home in Florida, Jim would make
frequent trips to New Haven for parade meet-
ings and, of course, the parade itself. The
shrine in his home, a collection of memorabilia
and keepsakes, speaks to the special place
the Parade and the Committee held in his
heart.
In his retirement, Jim also followed another
of his passions—firefighting. The son of Cap-
tain in the New Haven Fire Department, Jim
proudly followed in his footsteps becoming a
volunteer with the Branford Fire Department
for many years. Jim’s fascination with his fa-
ther’s legacy could be seen in his collection of
hundreds of carefully crafted fire engine mod-
els which he painstakingly built in his free
time. One of his other favorite pastimes was
serving in the Connecticut Foot Guard’s 2nd
Company—a historical state military organiza-
tion whose members volunteer their time and
talents to events and programs across Con-
necticut.
I consider myself fortunate to have called
Jim my friend and, like for so many others, his
absence will leave a hole that will never quite
be filled. I extend my deepest sympathies to
Janice, Jim Jr. and Jennifer. I hope that they
know what an incredible impact he had on the
lives of his friends and colleagues. Jim will be
missed but never forgotten.

dear friend, and forever Chairman, Elijah
Cummings of the Oversight and Reform Com-
mittee, who passed away last month. The op-

HOW WE WILL REMEMBER OUR BOSS, CHAIR-
MAN ELIJAH CUMMINGS: MORAL CLARITY IN
ALL HE DID
(By Current and Former Staff of Rep. Elijah
Cummings)
As current and former congressional staff
of the late Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, chair-
man of the House Oversight and Reform
Committee, we had the great honor and
privilege of working with him over the
course of more than two decades.
Many public figures have praised the chair-
man in recent days, extolling his unmatched
integrity, courageous leadership and com-
mitment to service and justice. To these
well-deserved tributes, we would like to add
our own eulogy, based on our experience
working by his side.
He was inspiring, both in public and even
more so in private. He brought moral clarity
to everything he did, and his purpose was
pure—to help those among us who needed it
most. He taught us that our aim should be to
‘‘give a voice to the voiceless,’’ including
families whose drinking water had been
poisoned, sick patients who could no longer
afford their medicine and, most of all, vul-
nerable children and ‘‘generations yet un-
born.’’
Whether in a hearing room full of members
of Congress or in a quiet conversation with
staff, his example motivated us to become
our best selves in the service of others.
He was genuine. He insisted on personally
interviewing every staff member he hired so
he could ‘‘look into their eyes.’’ Each of us
has a personal memory of sitting down with
him for the first time, and it was like noth-
ing we had experienced before. He would ask
why we were interested in public service,
how we thought we could contribute and
what motivated us.
Then he would lean in and ask in his low
baritone voice, ‘‘But . . . what feeds your
soul?’’
More than a few of us left those interviews
with tears in our eyes, perhaps feeling that
we had learned more about ourselves than
about him. He made that kind of personal
connection with everyone he met, from the
people of his district, to witnesses who testi-
fied at hearings, to whistleblowers who re-
ported waste, fraud or abuse. Since his pass-
ing, we have been inundated with messages
from many whose lives he touched.
He was demanding. He would boast that he
had the hardest working staff in Congress
and that he sometimes would call or email
us in the middle of the night, which was ab-
solutely true. His directive to be ‘‘effective
and efficient in everything you do’’ still
rings in our ears.

In exchange, he listened to us, respected us
and trusted us. He made sure we knew he was
truly proud of us—memories we each now
cherish. The result of his unwavering sup-
port was fierce loyalty from every member
of his staff. We committed to doing every-
thing in our power to fulfill his vision.
He was a unifying force, even in this era of
partisanship. He would command order with
a sharp rap of his gavel, elevate debate by
noting that ‘‘we are better than that’’ and
urge all of us to seek ‘‘not just common
ground, but higher ground.’’
Guided by his faith and values, he would
look for and bring out the good in others,
forming bridges through human connection.
He fully grasped the moment in which we
are now living. He invoked history books
that will be written hundreds of years from
now as he called on us to ‘‘fight for the soul
of our democracy.’’ As he said, this is bigger
than one man, one president or even one gen-
eration.
He was acutely aware of his own transience
in this world, He reminded us repeatedly
that we are here ‘‘only for a minute’’ and
that all of us soon will be ‘‘dancing with the
angels.’’
He would thunder against injustice, or on
behalf of those who could not fight for them-
selves, and he would vow to keep battling
until his ‘‘dying breath.’’ He did just that.
His final act as chairman came from his hos-
pital bed just hours before his death, as he
continued to fight for critically ill children
suddenly in danger of deportation.
He had so much left to accomplish, but he
has left it for us to complete. As he told us
presciently, ‘‘These things don’t happen to
us, they happen for us.’’
It is difficult to describe the emptiness we
now feel. His spirit was so strong, and his en-
ergy so boundless, that the void is dev-
astating.
But, of course, he left us with instructions:
‘‘Pain, passion, purpose. Take your pain,
turn it into your passion, and make it your
purpose.’’ He lived those words, and he in-
spired us to do the same.
Sometimes, after a big event, he would
take us aside for a quiet moment and say, ‘‘I
just want to thank you for everything you do
and for being a part of my destiny.’’
Today, we thank him for being part of
ours. And we commit to carrying forward his
legacy in the limited time allotted to each of
us—to give voice to the voiceless, to defend
our democracy, and to always reach for high-
er ground.

HONORING ALUMINUM CASTING
COMPANY
HON. RUSS FULCHER
OF IDAHO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mr. FULCHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor a hometown business in Hay-
den, Idaho that is receiving the Department of
Labor’s Honoring Investment in Recruiting and
Employing (HIRE) Vets Medallion Award
today. Founded as the Los Angeles Aluminum
Casting Company in 1947, LA Aluminum has
been a staple of the local community in Hay-
den since 1972. LA Aluminum makes castings
for critical components that support the aero-
space, automotive, dental, and military indus-
tries. As a third-generation family-owned busi-
ness in Idaho, Robert Oswald and his daugh-
ter Sarah continue the great tradition of mak-
ing American products for American compa-
nies in Idaho. That’s why I am proud to honor
the Oswald family and the wonderful employ-
ees of LA Aluminum for their investments in
recruiting, employing, and retaining military
veterans in Idaho. Our veterans answer the
call to serve, protect our way of life, our sys-
tem of government, and the freedoms that we
want to enjoy every day. The HIRE Vets
Award is the only federal-level veterans’ em-
ployment award that recognizes companies
committed to hiring and retaining veterans. I
thank the employees of LA Aluminum for
prioritizing our veterans and those that an-
swered the call to service. The HIRE Vets Me-
dallion Award is a symbol of their culture, pas-
sion, and love for our country and our armed
services.

RECOGNIZING DON GUINNIP’S CON-
SISTENT PRODUCTION OF HIGH-
QUALITY SOYBEANS
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS
OF ILLINOIS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise to
recognize Don Guinnip, a member of my Ag
Advisory Board in the 15th district of Illinois,
who was recently cited by the Illinois Soybean
Association High Yield PLUS Quality program
for consistently producing soybeans that rank
very high in livestock feed value.
Don is a farmer in the Wabash River Valley
near Marshall, IL., who makes a point to know
the nutritional makeup of the soybeans he
grows. He feels that this knowledge is essen-
tial to meeting the specific needs of the soy-
bean industry’s largest and most important
customer, the livestock producer. Livestock
consume more than 70 percent of the U.S.
soybean crop each year.
Don has submitted soybean samples for nu-
tritional analysis for seven years. His 2018
sample of Stine Seed Company variety
38LE02 yielded a composite feed value of
$347.40 per ton, putting him in the top 15
growers in Illinois for feed value.
Madam Speaker, I congratulate Don
Guinnip on choosing soybean varieties that
best serve livestock producers, and I encour-
age other farmers to maximize the U.S. feed-
market opportunities as well.

the sole purpose of recognizing and thanking
those who put their lives on the line on behalf
of our communities.
This is exactly the type of initiative that rep-
resents the true values of the good people in
my district. While I am humbled by, and grate-
ful for, their efforts, I am not surprised by this
true reflection of their priorities and their char-
acter.
The often thankless undertakings of our
men and women in public safety are what
keep the fabric of our great nation together by
saving our lives, protecting our property and
providing peace of mind in an often chaotic

HONORING THE ADIRONDACK
DAILY ENTRPRISE’S 125TH ANNI-
VERSARY
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor The Adirondack Daily Enter-
prise on their 125th year in operation.
Charles W. Lansing of Plattsburgh and Carl
D. Smith of Malone established the Adiron-
dack Enterprise in 1895 and on February 21st
of that year, the first issue of the paper was
published. Through mergers with other papers
and continual improvement, they soon became
one of the preeminent newspapers in northern
New York. They have seen highs and lows
over the years notably, when the Harrietstown
Town Hall, which housed the paper, burned to
the ground. Despite this setback, the paper
continued to publish uninterrupted. In 1926,
from their historic headquarters at the Old En-
terprise Building, the Adirondack Enterprise
ramped up to daily publication and became
the institution we know today. The Adirondack
Daily Enterprise remains a historic institution
in the North Country. It is the only daily paper
to serve the Adirondack Region, delivering im-
portant local news so that residents can stay
informed about their community.
On behalf on New York’s 21st Congres-
sional District, I want to congratulate the Adi-
rondack Daily Enterprise team for reaching
this historic milestone. Local news outlets are
an important component of the long-term
health of a community and I look forward to
them continuing to serve in that role into the
future.

RECOGNIZING SERGEANT MAJOR
MICHAEL GRINSTON ON HIS SE-
LECTION TO BECOME THE SIX-
TEENTH SERGEANT MAJOR OF
THE U.S. ARMY
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I would
like to recognize Sergeant Major Michael
Grinston on his selection to become the six-
teenth Sergeant Major of the United States
Army.
Having grown up in Jasper, Alabama, in
Alabama’s Fourth Congressional District, Ser-
geant Major of the Army Grinston enlisted in
the Army in 1987 to serve as an artilleryman.
During his thirty-two years in the Army, his de-
ployments included two tours each to Oper-
ation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom,
as well as Desert Shield/Desert Storm and a
deployment to Kosovo. He also served as the
senior enlisted leader for the Army’s first de-
ployment of a division headquarters, with the
First Infantry Division, in support of Operation
Inherent Resolve from October 2014 to June
2015.
In addition to serving as the I Corps Com-
mand Sergeant Major, Sergeant Major of the
Army Grinston most recently served as the
senior enlisted leader for U.S. Army Forces
Command (FORSCOM), the U.S. Army’s larg-
est command. He is a combat veteran who
has served in every level of leadership from
gunner to his current role as the United States
Army’s senior enlisted leader.
His awards and decorations include the
Army Distinguished Service Medal, Defense
Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit (two
awards), and five Bronze Stars (two with ‘‘V’’
devices). He has earned the Ranger tab, Mas-
ter Parachutist Badge, Air Assault Badge, Drill
Sergeant Identification Badge, and the Com-
bat Action Badge.
Sergeant Major of the Army Grinston earned
a Bachelor of Arts degree in Business Admin-
istration from the University of Maryland Uni-
versity College.
Madam Speaker, it is a great privilege to
recognize such an accomplished and dedi-
cated leader. I join his family, friends and col-
leagues in wishing him the greatest success in
this new role.

INTRODUCTION OF THE VETERANS
LEGAL SUPPORT ACT OF 2019
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Veterans Legal Support Act of
2019, which would allow the U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide support to
law school clinical programs that provide pro
bono legal and support services to veterans,
including assistance with disability claims and
appeals and foreclosures. There are already
at least 22 law schools that have clinics de-
voted to veterans’ legal needs, including the
William & Mary Law School Veterans Benefits
Clinic, which serves as a national model for
this idea and was the first recipient of a ‘‘best
practice’’ certification from the VA. There are
many other law schools, such as the Univer-
sity of the District of Columbia’s David A.
Clarke School of Law, that are interested in
starting their own VA-certified clinics.
More than 400,000 veterans are waiting for
their disability claims to be processed by the
VA. With the assistance of lawyers and law
professors, clinical programs provide free legal
resources to assist veterans in processing
their claims. My bill would merely build on
what some law schools have begun to do for
the last several years. More needs to be done
to sustain and increase these programs.
I was a tenured professor of law and contin-
ued to teach one seminar after being elected
to Congress. I saw the expert assistance that
clinical programs provide.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill, a
concrete measure that would assist our vet-
erans, who have repeatedly put their lives on
the line for this country.

RECOGNIZING AMERICAN LEGION
AUXILIARY’S 100TH ANNIVERSARY
HON. BILL HUIZENGA
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor and celebrate the 100th Anni-
versary of the American Legion Auxiliary, the
nation’s largest wartime veterans service orga-
nization.
The American Legion Auxiliary is a premier
service organization that has been a vital
asset to our community. By providing support
for our veterans, our military, and their fami-
lies, the American Legion Auxiliary shapes a
positive future in an atmosphere of fellowship,
patriotism, and peace.
Founded in 1919, the American Legion Aux-
iliary boasts almost one million members from
a range of different backgrounds. This past
year, the organization oversaw more than 40
million volunteer hours and raised $37 million
for charities across the US.
Specifically, the American Legion Auxiliary’s
West Michigan chapter, Roger B. Chaffee
Post 154, has been a pillar in our community
through their support of veterans, sponsorship
of local events, and youth development. Their
tireless work has dramatically increased the
quality of life for veterans and their families
across West Michigan.
The post gets their name from the late
Roger B. Chaffee, an American naval officer,
aeronautical engineer, and NASA astronaut in
the Apollo program. Roger B. Chaffee grew up
in West Michigan and graduated from Central
High School in Grand Rapids, Michigan,
where he excelled in academics and became
an Eagle Scout. Sadly, Roger perished in the
Apollo 1 fire on January 27, 1967, but his leg-
acy continues to live on throughout our coun-
try and in West Michigan.
Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating the American Legion Auxiliary and
the Roger B. Chaffee Post 154 for their 100
years of dedicated service to veterans
throughout our country and in West Michigan.

values. In 1974, the organization began its
fruitful relationship with then-Governor Ronald
Reagan, asking him to take on a nationally
syndicated radio program. President Reagan
continued his strong support of YAF by
hosting the organization’s annual summer stu-
dent conference at the White House from
1981 until 1988. In gratitude to this giant of
American Conservatism, YAF saved and took
ownership of the colloquially-dubbed ‘‘Western
White House’’ in 1998, using it as a space of
learning for our Nation’s Conservative-minded
youths.
YAF’ s incredible grassroots success is a di-
rect result of investing in the future of Amer-
ica. Young people are provided with seminars,
conferences, educational materials, access to
prominent speakers in the Conservative move-
ment, and internships. I saw YAF’s broad im-
pact firsthand when asked to speak to their
student audiences this past July at the organi-
zation’s National High School Leadership Con-
ference. It was inspiring to see so many young
people devoted to carrying on the legacy of
President Reagan and our Nation’s founding
values. So long as YAF continues its vocation
of service to our Nation’s youth, the future of
America’s Conservative movement remains
bright.
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s Tenth Congres-
sional District, I commend and congratulate
the Young America’s Foundation for 50 years
of tireless advocacy on behalf of individual
freedom, a strong national defense, free enter-
prise, and traditional values.

IN RECOGNITION OF MAYOR DINA
LONG
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR.
OF NEW JERSEY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I would
like to congratulate the Honorable Dina Long
on her retirement this year as Mayor of Sea
Bright, New Jersey. The Mayor’s 17 years of
service to Sea Bright are indicative of her
dedication to the community and her leader-
ship is highly deserving of this body’s recogni-
tion.
Following three terms on the Sea Bright
Borough Council, Mayor Long was elected as
mayor and began her term on January 1,
2012. Less than 10 months later, Superstorm
Sandy struck New Jersey, devastating several
coastal communities, including Sea Bright.
Leading the recovery efforts, Mayor Long es-
tablished important partnerships within the
community and state to bolster resources and
programs available to the town and its resi-
dents. Her vision, determination and proactive
response helped rebuild and revitalize the
town.
Mayor Long has been an outstanding public
servant, receiving commendations for her
leadership. Her tireless efforts in the wake of
Superstorm Sandy earned her an appointment
as a local Advisory Group member on the
President’s Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task
Force, a Telly Award and an American Shore
& Beach Preservation Association Local Gov-
ernment Award. As a speaker and panelist,
she has shared her insight and experiences
with several organizations and institutions
such as Brookdale Community College
Women in Learning and Leadership, the Jew-
ish Foundation of Monmouth County Sandy
Teen Fellows Program and the NJ Council of
Grantmakers, among many others.
In addition to her service to the Borough of
Sea Bright, Mayor Long has also established
a successful career as an educator, teaching
at Brookdale Community College and pre-
viously at Rutgers University, her under-
graduate alma mater. She also holds a mas-
ter’s degree from The New School.
Madam Speaker, I sincerely hope that my
colleagues will join me in congratulating Mayor
Dina Long on her retirement. Her impact on
the Sea Bright community is evident and
serves as an example of what steadfast com-
mitment and perseverance can accomplish.

HONORING THE CAREER AND
SERVICE OF MAYOR PAUL DYSTER
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the life and legacy
of city of Niagara Falls mayor, Paul Dyster, as
he prepares to step down from public office.
Mayor Dyster has served his community with
dignity and consistently strived to revitalize Ni-
agara falls. He leaves behind an outstanding
legacy of progress and growth in his commu-
nity.
Mayor Dyster began his political career in
2000, when he was elected to the Niagara
Falls City Council and served for three years.
In 2006, the Niagara Gazette named Paul
Dyster ‘‘Citizen of the Year.’’ That same year
the Niagara Falls Memorial Medical Center
granted him the ‘‘Good Neighbor Award.’’
Mayor Dyster has often taken his leadership
outside of politics as a youth mentor, serving
as scoutmaster of Boy Scouts of America
Troop 801 and Whirlpool Little League basket-
ball coach for a season.
In 2017, Mayor Dyster won the hotly con-
tested mayoral race and was subsequently re-
elected in 2011 and 2015. I have had the
pleasure of working closely with Mayor Dyster
throughout his three terms in office as he
made great advancements to the City of Niag-
ara Falls and contributed to the revitalization
of the city. He saw to the completion of a new
courthouse and public safety building, as well
as a new Amtrak train station. He restored the
historic customhouse in Niagara Falls and
began the destruction of the Niagara Falls
Scenic Parkway to begin development of New
Niagara Gorge State Park. All these accom-
plishments made Niagara Falls a more desir-
able destination for visitors and for residents.
Mayor Dyster strives to better the world out-
side of his mayoral duties and will continue to
do so after his term is over. Environmental
causes are near to his heart which is evi-
denced by his roles as Board Emeritus for
Buffalo-Niagara Riverkeeper, spokesman for
the Niagara River Environmental Coalition,
and as a founding member of the Niagara Wa-
terfront Revitalization Task force.
Mayor Dyster is, in his own words, a servant
leader who has always promoted the revital-
ization and preservation of his community. His
work always emphasizes community activism,
restoration, and conservation. In his time away
from public office, he will be able to focus on
his other passions, home brewing and fishing,
and quality time with his wife Rebecca and
sons, Ian and Bert. I have no doubt that he
will remain dedicated to serving his community
in other roles. As he steps down from the of-
fice he has occupied for over a decade, he
leaves big shoes to fill.

VETERAN TRANSITIONAL HEALTH
CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO
SABLAN
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Veteran Transitional Health Care
Improvement Act, which would provide vet-
erans one year of VA health care after they
separate from active service in the Armed
Forces or from active status with the National
Guard or Reserve. By providing health cov-
erage during this transition period, our nation
can better assist veterans to succeed as they
move into civilian life.
The transition to civilian life presents a num-
ber of challenges for veterans and their fami-
lies. Figuring out their next steps in education,
employment, housing, and health care is dif-
ficult. Our legislation, removes the burden of
health care, at least during that critical first
year of re-entry.
Knowing they have this coverage, including
the mental health care that can be so impor-
tant during transition, will free veterans to
focus on re-establishing their family relation-
ships and finding a new career.
Our bill requires the VA, the Pentagon, and
the Department of Labor all to make sure that
veterans are well informed about their eligi-
bility for this transitional health care coverage.
The Veteran Transitional Health Care Im-
provement Act will help the over one million
men and women serving our country in the ac-
tive and reserve components including those
from my district, the Northern Mariana Islands.
The Act has the endorsement of the Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars, American Legion and
Reserve Officers Association.
The gentlelady from American Samoa, Mrs.
RADEWAGEN, is an original cosponsor of the
bill.
I urge my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan legislation.

with the United States Forest Service. In 1973,
Bob accepted a position with the Rolla District
Rangers, relocating to Missouri. After twenty-
eight years of employment with the USFS,
Bob retired from federal service and turned his
focus to representing his community at the
state level.
Bob was elected to the Missouri House of
Representatives, serving from 2001 to 2008. It
was during this time that our paths first
crossed. He gave me my first job in govern-
ment as a legislative intern in Jefferson City
where I saw firsthand how he always placed
people over politics.
Bob has been married to his loving wife
Carlene for over 64 years. He and Carlene
have been active members of the First Pres-
byterian Church since they moved to Rolla
and he now serves as an Elder and is in-
volved in the church in countless ways. Bob is
the former President of the United Way and is
also a founding member of the Community
Partnership and the Rolla Public Schools Part-
nership in Education Committee. In addition,
Bob is active in the Rolla Optimist Club, Amer-
ican Legion Post 270, Korean War Veterans
Association Chapter 281, the Missouri Vet-
erans Home Assistance League, and Preven-
tion Consultants of Missouri. Following the
passing of their 24-year-old son, Pat, after a
battle with cancer, Bob and Carlene became
active with Compassionate Friends, a support
group for bereaved families of deceased chil-
dren.
Bob has had a profound impact on my life
and I will always have the utmost respect for
his political understanding, polite courage, and
unwavering dedication to service. It is truly an
honor to know this amazing person and call
him a friend. I am privileged today to recog-
nize Bob May before the United States House
of Representatives.

HON. LIZ CHENEY
OF WYOMING
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to congratulate Troy Reichert, of Guernsey,
WY on receiving the Medal of Honor Excel-
lence in Character Education Award from the
Congressional Medal of Honor Society.
Troy is an industrial technology teacher at
Guernsey-Sunrise High School and is known

awarded several grants from national organi-
zations and has earned a reputation as a
leader among his peers, and beloved teacher
by his students.
The Medal of Honor Excellence in Character
Education award is given to a teacher who
has taught students about the Congressional
Medal of Honor and the character and leader-
ship of the those who have earned it. The fact
that this award was presented by Staff Ser-
geant Sal Giunta, a Medal of Honor recipient,
is a testament to the honor that comes with
this prestigious award.
Again, Madam Speaker, I extend my con-
gratulations to Troy Reichert on this incredible

RECOGNIZING THE 2019 TABLE
ROCK LAKE CHAMBER OF COM-
MERCE AWARD WINNERS
HON. BILLY LONG
OF MISSOURI
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
commend Terry Plumb, Ken Bowling, Tanco II
Lumber Company, and the Reeds Spring unit
of Boys and Girls Club of the Ozarks for their
dedication and selfless contributions to the
Table Rock Lake community. On November
15, 2019, Lake Splash will recognize these
four individuals and organizations by pre-
senting them with awards for their service, and
I join Lake Splash in applauding these recipi-
ents.
Mr. Terry Plumb is a volunteer battalion
chief with the Southern Stone County Fire
Protection District and is this year’s recipient
of the Guardian Award for the bravery he ex-
hibited in the line of duty. The Guardian Award
is presented to a first responder in recognition
of their fearless or selfless service to the com-
munity. Mr. Plumb didn’t hesitate to risk his
own life to assist a motorist whose car had
caught fire; his actions and rapid response
prevented casualties or injuries during the inci-
dent. I applaud him for his selfless actions and
receiving this well-deserved recognition.
Tanco II Lumber Company is this year’s
Business of the Year for exemplary and high-
quality customer service while maintaining a
strong commitment to the community. This
year, Tanco II recently completed a new local
facility, expanded their product offerings, and
created several new jobs, making them an at-
tractive candidate for this award. They have
demonstrated a remarkable commitment to in-
vesting in their local community, and I con-
gratulate them on receiving this award.
Mr. Ken Bowling, owner of Ken Bowling
Construction, will receive this year’s Trail-
blazer Award for his contributions to the com-
munity during his tenure as a Stone County
Commissioner, and for his work as a member
of the Kimberling City Board of Alderman and
former Chairman of the Table Rock Lake
Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Bowling has al-
ways tirelessly served his community so it is
only fitting that he receives an award that rec-
ognizes leaders that forge a path for others in
their community.
The final award is presented to the Reeds
Spring unit of the Boys and Girls Club of the
Ozarks for providing vital after-school care and
education programs for children within this
community. The Community Service Award is
presented to an individual or organization who,
through their service or commitment, has im-
proved the quality of life, economy, edu-
cational opportunities, beauty, serenity, or
safety in their community. The Boys and Girls
Club of America offers invaluable resources to
families across the nation, and I applaud this
local branch’s work in the Table Rock Lake
area.
All of the recipients of the 2019 Lake Splash
Awards have made a significant impact on
their community and deserve this recognition.
I am honored to recognize their achievements,
and I thank each recipient for their contribu-
tions to Missouri’s 7th District.

HONORING GEORGE
MERGENTHALER
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, as we ap-
proach the 75th Anniversary of the Battle of
the Bulge, I would like to take a moment to
honor a true American hero, George Mergen-
thaler.
George was born on August 5th, 1920 and
was the only child of Alice and Hermann Mer-
genthaler of Rye, NY. He grew up in Rye and
was later accepted into Princeton University in
September of 1939.
A gifted athlete, dedicated student, hand-
some and charismatic, ‘‘Merg’’ as he was
known, was well liked by all who knew him.
With studies that focused on History and
English, George’s time at Princeton was ev-
erything he could have hoped for.
All that changed on December 7, 1941
when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor.
Like many of his generation, George enlisted
soon after the attack, but his enlistment was
deferred until he graduated in January 1943 in
an accelerated program. Just days later he
was sent to Camp Hood in Texas for basic
training. Discovering his fluency with German
and French, the army assigned George to the
28th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop.
Following overseas training in Wales,
George and the rest of the Recon Troop en-
tered the European Theater of Operation in
mid-July 1944 with the 28th Infantry Division
and would fight their way through France, into
Belgium and on to Luxembourg. In mid-No-
vember the Troop arrived in Eschweiler, Lux-
embourg, their home for the next month.

REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1411
November 8, 2019
Because of his ease with language, George
more than any of the other soldiers, endeared
himself to the people of the small farming
town. Together they shared meals, church
services, hopes and dreams. Then on Decem-
ber 16th, 1944, the Germans launched a sur-
prise attack in the Ardennes Forest. The Battle
of the Bulge was underway. By mid-afternoon
on December 18th, the German attack had
pushed deep into Luxembourg, and
Eschweiler was nearly surrounded. The Recon
Troop held the town as long as possible be-
fore pulling out. Just a mile outside of town,
their convoy drove into a German ambush.
Pinned down on the narrow, treelined road,
death or capture were their only options. Real-
izing their desperate situation, George sprang
to action. Showing no regard for his personal
safety, George jumped into the back of a jeep,
manned a 50-caliber machine gun and pro-
vided enough covering fire for the rest of the
Recon Troop soldiers to make their escape.
Seconds later the machine gun jammed. As
George tried to clear the breach, German bul-
lets cut him down. George’s selfless and he-
roic actions that day allowed the rest of the
Recon Troop to survive not only that ambush
but the war. Madam Speaker, George Mer-
genthaler made the ultimate sacrifice that day
so that others could live in peace. I would like
to thank this body for posthumously recog-
nizing George Mergenthaler, a true American
hero.

TRIBUTE TO HONOR THE LIFE OF
MARY MARGARET ‘‘MOO’’ AN-
DERSON
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the life of an extraordinary woman
and legendary supporter of art and artists,
Mary Margaret Anderson, affectionately known
to all as ‘‘Moo’’.
Moo was born in Boston in 1926 and died
on October 22, 2019, at the age of 92. She
was a graduate of D’Youville College and met
her husband Harry, known as Hunk, in 1948.
While in college, Hunk started a food service
business, Saga Corporation. After Moo and
Hunk married in 1950, they moved to Ohio
and then to California to expand the business.
A trip to Europe and a visit to the Louvre in
the 1960’s ignited Moo and Hunk’s love for
contemporary art. They began collecting art
which reflected their beliefs in the importance
of ‘head and hands’, or ingenuity as well as
masterful craftsmanship. They wanted to see
the creativity of the artist but also wanted to
know that real work went into the art. Much of
the family’s art collection was hung in their
one-story Silicon Valley home and in the Saga
headquarters in Menlo Park. The collection
contained important Abstract Expressionists,
Color Field Painting, Post-Minimalism, Cali-
fornia Funk Art, Bay Area Figurative Art, and
Contemporary abstract painting. Many of the
most significant works are now housed in the
Anderson Collection at Stanford University, a
collection of 121 works by 86 artists which the
Andersons donated in 2014. Two important
works by Jackson Pollock and Willem De
Koonig were donated shortly before Moo’s
death, adding to paintings by Helen
Frankenthaler, Agnes Martin, Joan Mitchell,
Robert Motherwell, Frank Stella, Wayne
Thiebaud and many other important American
artists.
In addition to the eponymous museum at
Stanford, the Andersons donated works to the
San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and
the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco,
among others.
Moo loved her husband, daughter, grand-
daughter, philanthropy, and golf. She gave
generously of her time and considerable tal-
ents in service to Sacred Heart Schools, St.
Francis Center, and Stanford Hospital, and
she taught children through Art in Action in
Menlo Park.
On hearing of Moo’s death, Stanford Univer-
sity President Marc Tessier-Levigne, said
‘‘Moo Anderson will forever be remembered
for her love of art, but also for her love of
sharing art. She opened her home so that stu-
dents could have that same experience of
looking and learning about art. We are so
deeply grateful that Moo and Hunk trusted
Stanford to be stewards of their remarkable
collection and enable people of all ages to ex-
perience it on a daily basis.’’
Moo was predeceased by her husband
Hunk, and leaves her daughter Mary Patricia
‘‘Putter’’ Anderson Pence and her beloved
granddaughter, Devin Pence. She will be
deeply missed by them and by all who had the
good fortune to know her. Her legacy will live
on through the magnificent art she and Hunk
have so generously shared with Stanford and
all of us.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in honoring the extraordinary life of an ex-
traordinary woman and expressing our condo-
lences to her daughter, granddaughter and the
thousands who loved her and mourn her pass-
ing.

TRIBUTE TO VETERANS OF THE

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise
to pay tribute to all the men and women who
have served in the Armed Forces of the
United States and risked their lives to defend
our freedoms and way of life and took and
lived the oath to ‘‘support and defend the Con-
stitution of the United States against all en-
emies, foreign and domestic’’ and bore true
faith and allegiance to the same, an obligation
they took freely, without any mental reserva-
tion or purpose of evasion.’’
Veterans are truly heroes walking among
us.
I want to thank all of our armed servicemen
and women for their selfless dedication to our
protection every day.
Veterans Day is a reminder to all of us who
live in freedom that as President Kennedy
said, ‘‘The price of freedom is high, but Ameri-
cans have always paid it.’’
This Veterans Day is a welcome opportunity
to remember that the fallen who gave the last
full measure of devotion to their country on
battlefields around the world—in places whose
names may be unforgettable—or locations that
have slipped into the pages of history.
We will never forget:
Revolutionary War: Valley Forge; York
Town.
Civil War: The Battle of Antietam; The Battle
of Gettysburg.
World War I: The Battle of Argonne; Flan-
ders Field; Verdun.
World War II: Pearl Harbor; Battle of Ba-
taan; The Battle of Midway; D-Day; Battle of
the Bulge; Battle of Anzio; Battle of Cor-
regidor.
Korean War: Inchon; Heart Break Ridge;
Pork Chop Hill.
Vietnam: Tet Offensive; Battle of Hue.

have served our country around the world in
the name of freedom and democracy.
The debt that we owe to them is immeas-
urable.
Their sacrifices, and those of their families,
are freedom’s foundation.
Without the brave efforts of all the soldiers,
sailors, airmen, marines and Coast Guards-
men and women and their families, our coun-
try would not live so freely.
I offer my deepest gratitude to our nation’s
troops and reservists, their families, and the
21.6 million veterans, including 29,126 here in
the 18th Congressional District.
21.6 million brave men and women are vet-
erans of our nation’s military service.
This includes more than 2 million women,
2.7 million African American men and women,
1.5 million Hispanic men and women, 342,000
Asian American Pacific Islanders, and 178,000
American Indians.
Nine in ten military families believe the pub-
lic does not understand or appreciate their
sacrifices.
We use Veterans Day to show our veterans
and military families how important they are to
us and how grateful we are for them each and
everyday.
November is National Caregivers Month to
show our caregivers how grateful we are for
them.
It is only fitting that we thank those care-
givers who serve our military today.
5.5 million spouses, parents, children, and
other loved ones care for our wounded war-
riors and 15 percent of caregivers spend 40+
hours a week providing care for our military
families.
As a senior member of the House Commit-
tees on Judiciary and Homeland Security, I
care deeply about our veterans.
I Congress, I have sponsored many legisla-
tive proposals and co-sponsored more than 50
pieces of legislation that will positively benefit
our veterans and their families.’’
On the battlefield, the military pledges to
leave no soldier behind.
As a nation, let it be our pledge that when
they return home, we leave no veteran behind.
This day and every day let us honor their
service with actions that fulfill our commitment
to our troops, their families, and our vet-
erans—and that are worthy of our grateful na-
tion.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE NAMING
OF THE DON H. BARDEN SEC-
ONDARY STREET
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Don H. Barden and cele-
brate his legacy through the naming of the
Don H. Barden Secondary Street. Don Barden
was an influential leader in Detroit and his
contributions to our community are worthy of
commendation.
Don Barden was a trailblazer in politics,
business, and philanthropy. In the 1960s, Mr.
Barden served as the first black city council-
man in Lorain, Ohio, where he learned about
the intersection of business and politics. Ad-
mired by many in Congress, Mr. Barden also
developed life-long friendship with countless
mayors, state representatives, and city council
members, among a variety of other political
leaders nationwide.
Don Barden was also an astute business-
man who successfully developed, owned, and
operated several businesses in multiple indus-
tries. Mr. Barden was renowned for his work
in real estate, broadcasting, international
trade, and casinos, and received widespread
acclaim for his efforts. In the 1980s, Mr.
Barden became a leader in Michigan’s cable
industry, establishing and operating cable sys-
tems throughout Metro Detroit. Under Mr.
Barden’s guidance and expertise, Barden Ca-
blevision was designated as one of the na-
tion’s largest urban cable systems. Later, Mr.
Barden became the first black owner of a Las
Vegas casino after his purchase of Fitzgeralds
in 2001. In addition to a host of other posi-
tions, Mr. Barden also served as President
and CEO of Barden Companies, Inc.
Throughout his professional endeavors, Mr.
Barden was devoted to community involve-
ment and volunteerism. He embedded a mis-
sion within his businesses to make a dif-
ference in the communities where they oper-
ated and conducted business and encouraged
others to follow in stride. Mr. Barden was also
committed to personal philanthropy, supporting
countless organizations, people, and entities
throughout the Metro Detroit region. Mr.
Barden will always be remembered for his
generous and thoughtful heart.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me today in celebrating the legacy of Don H.
Barden. Mr. Barden was a pillar of Detroit, and
the naming of the secondary street in honor of
Mr. Barden is a touching tribute to his life’s
work. Mr. Barden was cherished by so many
within our community, and I am glad the street
will bear his name for generations to come.

HONORING THE USS ‘‘INDIANAP-
OLIS,’’ THE UNITED STATES
NAVY’S NEWEST LITTORAL COM-
BAT SHIP
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise to
honor the U.S. Navy’s newest addition to its
fleet, the Freedom-class Littoral Combat Ship,
USS Indianapolis.
On October 26, before a crowd of thou-
sands, the USS Indianapolis (LCS–17) was
commissioned in Burns Harbor, Indiana, on
the shore of Lake Michigan. I thank the Navy,
particularly former Secretary Ray Mabus, for
having the foresight to name a ship being con-
structed on the Great Lakes after Indiana’s
capital city and the decision by the current
Secretary of the Navy, Richard Spencer, to
host the commissioning ceremony in Burns
Harbor.
LCS–17 was constructed in Marinette, Wis-
consin, utilizing steel produced by hard-work-
ing steelworkers in Northwest Indiana. She will
soon transit to her new homeport, Naval Sta-
tion Mayport in Jacksonville, Florida, where
she will begin her service to our country. As
the fourth USS Indianapolis in U.S. naval his-
tory, this ship will carry on the proud legacy of
representing Indiana’s capital city around the
globe.
Today, it is also fitting to honor the prior
ships that bore the name USS Indianapolis.
The first (ID 3865) was a cargo ship that
served at the end of World War I. The second
(CA 35) was the heavy cruiser that was lost
while completing a mission that would directly
contribute to the end of World War II. Of the
1,195 crewmen aboard, only 316 survived. It
was an honor to have four of those sur-
vivors—Fire Controlman Third Class Robert
Witzig, Aviation Machinist Mate Third Class
James Jarvis, Seaman Richard Thelen, and
Sergeant Edgar Harrell—present at the com-
missioning ceremony. The third (SSN 697)
was a Los Angeles-class fast attack sub-
marine that was a valuable Cold War asset
from 1980 through 1998.
I am grateful for the Commanding Officer,
CDR Colin Kane, as well as the entire crew of
the USS Indianapolis. I am also thankful for
the unsung heroes—the families and loved
ones—whose sacrifices and support ashore
allow the crew to stand the watch that the
U.S. Navy has stood for 244 years.
Additionally, I’d like to recognize the efforts
of so many in Northwest Indiana who have
been supportive of the work of the USS Indi-
anapolis Commissioning Committee. Thanks
in part to these efforts, I know the USS Indian-
apolis will serve our community and country
with pride. The crew will have many days of
deployment ahead of them. I know that they
have the unwavering support of the nearly 6.7
million residents of Indiana,
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me in wishing the following women and men
of the USS Indianapolis fair winds and fol-
lowing seas:

HONORING ALEX GRAHAM
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to ask the House of Representatives to join
me in remembering the life of the District of
Columbia 2018 Firefighter of the Year, Alex
Graham, a 17-year veteran of the District of
Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Serv-
ices Department, who died in the line of duty.
Alex Graham suffered a heart attack while
on duty, and later died on October 27, 2019,
surrounded by family at George Washington
University Hospital.
Graham was raised in Annapolis, Maryland,
and attended Bowie High School. He was a
humble and dedicated public servant and
technician. As a firefighter with Engine 21 in
Adams Morgan, known as the Alley Rats, he
worked to protect the lives of D.C. residents.
Graham was known to go above and beyond,
ensuring that fire station equipment was top
grade. He meticulously worked behind the
scenes, researching equipment issues and fix-
ing them, which at times meant traveling from
firehouse to firehouse restringing 500 ladders.
For his efforts repairing fire trucks, maintain-
ing ladders and managing water flow, Graham
was named Firefighter of the Year in 2018.
While the limelight did not come naturally, the
award was undeniably well-deserved.
Graham is an irreplaceable member of En-
gine 21. He will be remembered for his skills,
dedication and humility. His death sheds light
on the tireless work of the department’s men
and women to protect D.C. residents.
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in recognizing the life
of Alex Graham and his dedication to the safe-
ty of District of Columbia residents. We re-
member him with tremendous gratitude for his
service.

HONORING MRS. ERIN TIDERMAN-
GROSS AND MRS. DEIRDRE
ABRAMS
HON. RUSS FULCHER
OF IDAHO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mr. FULCHER. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor two wonderful teachers from
Idaho: Mrs. Erin Tiderman-Gross of Meridian,
Idaho, and Mrs. Deirdre Abrams of Donnelly,
Idaho who have been awarded the Presi-
dential Award for Excellence in Mathematics
and Science Teaching. This award is the high-
est honor bestowed by the United States gov-
ernment for teachers in science, technology,
engineering, mathematics, and computer stud-
ies. I am proud today to recognize the hard
work of Mrs. Abrams and Mrs. Tiderman-
Gross and their dedication, commitment, and
passion for our students’ success in the
sciences.
At Rocky Mountain High School in Meridian,
Idaho—my hometown—Mrs. Tiderman-Gross
teaches advanced placement biology and has
acted as a mentor to hundreds of students in
the National Honor Society. Mrs. Tiderman-
Gross is an adviser in one of the largest,
most-active National Honor Society Chapters
in Idaho. She has impacted countless families,
students, and community members through
her work, and after 24 years, continues to
share her passion for biology with her stu-
dents. At Donnelly Elementary School, Mrs.
Abrams has taken the world to her students
through place-based learning. Mrs. Abrams
has given her students hands-on educational
trips to study rainbow trout populations, polli-
nator gardens, and cattle data to improve
water quality. Her students even share their
water quality data with local government agen-
cies. Mrs. Abrams has been an educator for
23 years and continues to be a shining exam-
ple of innovative teaching in the sciences. I
thank Mrs. Erin Tiderman-Gross and Mrs.
Deirdre Abrams for their passion and commit-
ment to their students. This honor bestowed
upon them is a testament to their dedication
and I am so proud of their representation of
the great State of Idaho.

HONORING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF AMERICAN LEGION
BRAXTON-PERKINS POST 25
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT
OF VIRGINIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I
rise today to commemorate the 100th anniver-
sary of the American Legion Braxton-Perkins
Post 25 in Newport News, Virginia. Since its
inception, the American Legion has advocated
for benefits for veterans and helped create
many important programs for families, children
and communities. While the American Legion
has posts all over the nation, I want to high-
light the history and work of Braxton-Perkins
Post 25.
In 1918, when the Armistice was signed and
World War I ended, the process of demobiliza-
tion began. This brought many Army and Navy
veterans back to the city of Newport News.
Many ex-service members were war-weary but
looking for ways to keep the spirit of comrade-
ship alive with the men and women with whom
they served overseas. In August 1919, Fred
H. Skinner, a young lawyer who served as a
captain in the 119th Infantry, tapped his local
social circle of former servicemembers and
gathered the required number of signatures to
apply for a charter from the Legion. The char-
ter was approved on August 25 of that year.
The first meeting of Braxton-Perkins was
held in Newport News City Hall in September
of 1919. After that, the Post contacted the War
Camp Community Service to use their building
for meetings and office space. Later, this
building was purchased by the Post from the
War Camp Community Service after they had
stopped utilizing the facility.
Post 25 is named after two local Newport
News men who died overseas during World
War I. Elliott Muse Braxton was killed in action
in the Meuse-Argonne fighting and Lieutenant
Pryor Richard Perkins, a member of the Air
Service, died in a plane crash on the Argonne
front.
The Post began its activity in earnest in
1920 with a variety of social activities and civic
endeavors. Since then, it has come to be one
of the most respected organizations in New-
port News because it has constantly given
back to our community. The Post set up a kin-
dergarten and free health clinics for children,
they aid the sick and wounded and have
helped many veterans financially. The Post
has provided many veterans with food, cloth-
ing and access to employment. They also help
arrange hospitalization and military funerals for
veterans regardless of whether or not they
were members of the Legion.
Madam Speaker, as our nation observes
Veterans Day this Monday, Newport News is
fortunate to have an organization like Braxton-
Perkins Post 25 serving and supporting our
veterans and their families for the last 100
years. I look forward to seeing all the good
they will continue to do in the years ahead as
a pillar of our community.

HONORING THE EVANS MILLS PRI-
MARY SCHOOL 1ST AND 2ND
GRADE VETERANS DAY CONCERT
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK
OF NEW YORK
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to honor the Evans Mills Primary School
1st and 2nd Grade Veterans Day Concert.
For the past five years, the Evans Mills Pri-
mary School Veterans Day Committee and its
chair, Mrs. Lewis, have organized this wonder-
ful concert in honor of our veterans. Beyond
the concert itself, the committee has led a
food drive for veterans with all donations going
to ‘‘Feed Our Vets,’’ a local program in Water-
town. In addition, the committee arranged for
veterans to come to the school and speak di-
rectly with students about their experiences.
Students have created art projects around the
theme of honoring our veterans and those
pieces will be displayed during the concert
alongside real uniforms and gear. The com-
mittee has partnered with Fort Drum’s 1st Bri-
gade Combat Team, under the command of
Lieutenant Colonel MacDonald, to organize
this and other veteran’s events at the school.
Events like this highlight the community spir-
it in the North Country. Veterans and active
duty service members make up a large part of
our community and it is important for individ-
uals of all ages to recognize and celebrate
their service to our nation. On behalf of New
York’s 21st Congressional District, I want to
thank the Evans Mills Primary School Vet-
erans Day Committee and everyone who do-
nated or helped organize this event for their
work honoring our veterans.

AND THE VINKEMULDER FAMILY
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in honor of our country’s veterans on the 81st
observance of Veterans Day as a national hol-
iday and the 101st anniversary of the armi-
stice that ended World War I.
I would specifically like to recognize the
Vinkemulder family. Philip C. Vinkemulder
proudly served in the US Army infantry during
WWI. He went on to marry his wife Frances,
start a family of 6 sons and 2 daughters, and
move to the area known today as Coconut
Creek, Florida. Following their father, all six of
the Vinkemulder sons served honorably in the
U.S. military when their time came. I thank
Phil, Paul, Bob, Neal, Gordon, and Dale, for
their service to our country. Several members
of the Vinkemulder family will dedicate trees
planted in Veteran’s Park in their honor.
I would also like to recognize the seven vet-
erans who participated in the Honor Flights
this year. Bernard Hurowitz, Navy, WWII. John
DeChant, Marines, Vietnam. Stanley Hirsch,
Navy, Korea. George Waldspurger, Air Force,
Vietnam. Martin Pines, Army, Korea. Stephen
Del Gaudio, Army, Korea. Angelo Campione,
Army Air Corps, WWII. I thank them all for
their service.
As a country, we are eternally grateful for all
our active duty troops and veterans who sac-
rificed everything for our freedoms. Please join
me in recognizing the Honor Flight Veterans,
the Vinkemulder Family, and all veterans on
this holiday.

IN HONOR OF FRANK BOUDREAU
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, November 8, 2019
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor Frank Boudreau, who is retiring after
45 years of service to the citizens of New
Hampshire. Throughout his distinguished ca-
reer, Mr. Boudreau has served as a Program
Planner for the Southern NH Services, a
CETA Program Operations Director, a Mem-
ber of the NH Job Training Council, SNHS NH
Employment Program and, most recently,
overseeing SNHS’s workforce activities and
services to TANF public assistance recipients.

self as a person of the highest integrity and a
champion of public service. He received a
bachelor’s degree in Political Science from
Saint Anselm College and a master’s degree
in Public Administration from the University of
New Hampshire.
For the better part of the past five decades,
Mr. Boudreau has helped support our commu-
nities through his critical work at SNHS. He
has led programs which assist low income
residents of New Hampshire in securing em-
ployment, attaining adequate education, and
addressing critical needs such as access to
quality health care and housing. Throughout
his career, Mr. Boudreau’s commitment to
serving his community has left an indelible im-
pact on countless Granite Staters.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to
thank Frank Boudreau for his decades of dedi-
cation to our community. I congratulate him on
his accomplished public service career, and I
wish him all the best in his well-deserved re-
tirement.
