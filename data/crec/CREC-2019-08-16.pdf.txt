HONORING JORDAN HALL
HON. GREG PENCE
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 16, 2019
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize a member of my staff that has been
with me since the beginning of my campaign.
Jordan Hall, 23, has served in my District
office since January. Before that, he traveled
with me across the District during our cam-
paign.
Folks across the 6th District know Jordan
for his work ethic, warm smile, and friendly de-
meanor.
We are losing a strong member of the team,
but Jordan will remain a member of our Hoo-
sier, and 6th District, family.
Jordan will be studying at the Indiana Uni-
versity Robert H. McKinney School of Law on
the campus of IUPUI in Indianapolis.
I wish Jordan luck, though I know it will be
his work ethic and determination that gets him
though this next chapter of life.
I wish Jordan, and his wife Chelsea, all the
best as they continue to pursue their dreams
and ambitions.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF
LOUISE MAUDE BEATON
HON. JIMMY PANETTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 16, 2019
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
on behalf of Louise Maude Beaton, an indi-
vidual who gave more than half a century of
diligent volunteer service to American veterans
at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Fres-
no County, California.
Beginning in 1963 and until her passing in
May of 2019, Ms. Beaton devoted her life to
serving as a volunteer to better the lives of the
veterans in her community. Initially working as
a switchboard operator for the Medical Center,
she extended the scope of her work consider-
ably over the next five decades. Eventually,
she became an indispensable part of the hos-
pital’s operations, taking on positions in nearly
every department. Ms. Beaton applied herself
to her volunteer positions with an admirable
degree of consistency, dedication, and altru-
istic spirit, culminating in her completion of
55,617 hours of volunteer work.
Now, Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to
recognize the legacy of Louise Beaton. I ask
my colleagues to join me in honoring her, her
tireless work, and her incredible contributions
to the health and wellbeing of our veterans.
HONORING ALBERT A. CODERNIZ
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 16, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Albert A. Coderniz, an upstanding mem-
ber of the Dos Palos community, who has
been recognized as an honoree for the 2019
Harvest of Hope Dinner by Catholic Charities
of Merced, California.
Mr. Coderniz was born on March 4, 1934 in
Manteca, California to Frank and Maria
Coderniz, who had immigrated to the United
States in 1920 after marrying in the Azores a
week prior. His family settled in California’s
San Joaquin Valley and entered the dairy
business after buying a small herd of dairy
cattle. They moved throughout various towns
in the north Valley and eventually settled in
Dos Palos in 1951. Raised in a Portuguese
dairy family, the values of hard work and a
strong Catholic faith were instilled in Mr.
Coderniz and his siblings early on.
Mr. Coderniz attended Dos Palos High
School where he was active in sports and
music while also serving as student body
president and participating in Portuguese cele-
brations. It was during this time that he met
his future wife, Arlene. After attending UC
Davis for a year, Mr. Coderniz returned to Dos
Palos to help his father on their farm and
dairy, which would later become the first
Grade A Dairy in the Dos Palos area. While
he has enjoyed the successes of his family’s
business, he has always been a stellar com-
munity servant.
For 70 years, Mr. Coderniz’s involvement
and dedication to the Dos Palos community
has never wavered. He is a Sacred Heart
Catholic School founding member and has
served on their board as a member and presi-
dent. He is a Fourth Degree Knight with the
Knights of Columbus and involved in many ca-
pacities with his parish, Sacred Heart.
In addition to the involvement with his
church, Mr. Coderniz is a member of the Cali-
fornia Milk Advisory Board and the Dos Palos
Portuguese D.E.S. Association, among other
various civic engagements. He often gives of
himself by driving people to appointments and
helping others with various tasks when asked.
Mr. Coderniz and his wife Arlene are the
parents of daughters Karen and Kristy and
grandparents to Marlynn, Mark, Catherine, and
Joey. They have been loyal supporters of
Catholic education and were present at many
of their grandchildren’s Catholic school events
throughout the Valley.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in honoring the exceptional life of Al-
bert A. Coderiz. It is both fitting and appro-
priate that we honor him as he is recognized
at the 2019 Harvest of Hope Dinner in
Merced.
HONORING AMY SHIMBERG FOR
HER SELFLESS DEVOTION TO
HELP THE PEOPLE OF THE
TAMPA BAY COMMUNITY
HON. KATHY CASTOR
OF FLORIDA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 16, 2019
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I
rise today in admiration and respect to honor
the life and unselfish works of Amy Shimberg.
Amy’s remarkable contributions to our home-
town of Tampa had a tremendous impact on
our neighbors and is worthy of recognition.
She is survived by her five children and their
spouses, 15 grandchildren, brother and nu-
merous nieces and nephews who she loved
very much.
Amy was born, raised and educated in New
York City. She obtained her bachelor’s degree
from New York University and her master’s in
education from Columbia University. After
teaching in New York, she followed her par-
ents to Florida where she continued teaching.
Amy met the love of her life and life partner
in doing good, Jim, on a blind date. Jim and
Amy started their 50-year marriage and settled
in Tampa in 1958.
Amy was a tireless community volunteer
with a very strong interest in public education.
She served as PTA president of every school
her children attended and continued her in-
volvement with the PTA after her youngest
graduated from high school. Many organiza-
tions in the Tampa Bay Area benefited from
her tireless advocacy and passion. She served
on the Citizens Advisory Board to the
Hillsborough County School Board and the
board of the Hillsborough Education Founda-
tion. She also volunteered for Meals on
Wheels in the 1970s and continued serving for
more than 25 years, twice as president. She
loved helping her neighbors in such a direct
and personal way. In a window into Amy’s
heart, she believed that she gained more from
neighbors she visited and delivered meals to
than they did. In addition to her direct work
delivering meals, she was instrumental in rais-
ing funds for Meals on Wheels and was the
honorary chairperson of the capital campaign
to build a new facility. Her dedication to this
cause that brightens the days of so many is
unmatched and one of the main reasons
Meals on Wheels is such a success and Amy
is so revered in Tampa Bay.
Amy was instrumental in helping not just our
senior neighbors, but children as well. She co-
chaired a fundraising campaign for Nature’s
Classroom to benefit future generations of
sixth graders. She was recognized for her
wonderful work, including receiving the Com-
munity Hero Award from the Tampa Bay Light-
ning Foundation in 2014. The philanthropic
contributions of Amy and Jim improved the
lives of many people in the Tampa Bay area
and the James and Amy Shimberg Charitable
Trust and the James and Amy Shimberg
Foundation, will keep the good deeds going
for more generations.

HONORING THE LEADERSHIP AND
SERVICE OF RUSS BURNS TO
THE OPERATING ENGINEERS
LOCAL 3
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 16, 2019
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize Russ Burns upon his retire-
ment as the Business Manager for the Oper-
ating Engineers, Local 3. As a third-generation
operator and Local 3 member, Russ Burns
grew up living and breathing Local 3. He
began his career with Local 3 in 1979 as a
crane operator for various construction
projects such as high rises, bridges, refineries,
and large treatment plants throughout North-
ern California. In 1994, Russ joined the staff of
the union as a business representative in the
Fairfield District. Russ was unanimously ap-
pointed treasurer, serving until 2005 when he
was sworn in as financial secretary. In 2006,
he was elected Business Manager. Russ
Burns has influenced and inspired countless
Operating Engineer members beginning with
their apprenticeship training to being fully
qualified journeyman level professionals. Russ
Burns has been an integral part of the Oper-
ating Engineers Local 3, and he will be greatly
missed as he moves on to the next chapter of
his life. Please join me, and the men and
women of California’s 3rd Congressional Dis-
trict, in thanking Russ Burns for his out-
standing service. We wish him all the best in
his retirement and his future endeavors.

COMMENDING MR. RICHARD D.
MILTON ON HIS CONTRIBUTION
TO THE HELLFIRE MISSILE
HON. MO BROOKS
OF ALABAMA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 16, 2019
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Madam Speaker,
I rise today to recognize Mr. Richard D. Milton,
a key contributor to the development of the
Hellfire missile.
In the 1960s, Mr. Milton worked with a team
at the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Re-
search, Development, and Engineering Center
(AMRDEC) on Redstone Arsenal to find prac-
tical uses for lasers in the medical and military
fields. By 1965, Mr. Milton found a unique role
for lasers on the battlefield, and that by illu-
minating a target with a laser, a missile could
be guided to that target.
In March of 1979, Richard Milton’s inven-
tion, the Missile System Using Laser Illu-
minator, became U.S. Patent 4,143,835. U.S.
Patents 6,166,803, 6,296,803, and U.S. Patent
6,305,797 can also be attributed to Mr. Milton.
The invention of laser guided missiles contrib-
uted to the creation of the Hellfire missile, and
this revolutionized America’s defense. The
ability to be launched from various platforms,
the use of missiles by military personnel under
the protection of cover, the ability for long
range and multiple launches, and accuracy of
hit are all battlefield advantages of the Hellfire
missile.
Mr. Milton’s coworkers often refer to him as
‘‘Dick’’ and speak highly of his brilliance and
everyday problem-solving skills. Mrs. Debbee
Jordan, a coworker, says, ‘‘Working with Dick
and watching how he thought and attacked
each problem was a great gift for a just out of
college engineer.’’
Madam Speaker, the new-age ideas Rich-
ard Milton offered in the 1960s revolutionized
many U.S. ally’s missile systems and the U.S.
precision in missile defense we have today.
I commend Mr. Richard D. Milton for his in-
novation and passion for public service to the
American people.

IN HONOR OF RUTH LINDSAY
BURGESS
HON. ANDY BARR
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 16, 2019
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the life of a special woman, Ruth Lind-
say Burgess, of Lexington, Kentucky. Born in
1923 in Connersville, Pennsylvania as the only
daughter in her family, she grew up hunting
with her father and brothers. She was known
as quite a sharp shooter.
Ruth Lindsay enlisted in the Army on May
15, 1945. She bravely served in the South Pa-
cific as a nurse, caring for injured American
soldiers during heavy fighting. She earned the
rank of 2nd Lieutenant and earned a Victory
Medal.
Ms. Lindsay was discharged on March 11,
1946. She returned home where she met and
married her husband Frank Burgess, who also
served in World War II. They had three daugh-
ters. Mrs. Burgess worked as a hospital nurse
and then did private care nursing until she re-
tired. She was an avid volunteer for American
Legion Post 24. Ruth Lindsay Burgess passed
away on July 27, 2019 at the age of 95.
Mrs. Burgess and her fellow veterans are
true heroes. As members of the ‘‘Greatest
Generation’’, they willingly served to protect
and defend the freedoms that we enjoy today.
I am humbled to honor the service of Mrs.
Ruth Burgess before the United States Con-
gress.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE
OF MARTIN M. MEDELLIN
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 16, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor and recognize Mr. Martin Morin
Medellin. Martin passed away on July 24,
2019 at the age of 93. Martin was a distin-
guished WWII veteran and beloved member of
the Madera, California community.
Martin was born on January 30, 1926 in
Texas. During his grade school years, his par-
ents and their eight children moved to Madera,
where they set deep roots in the community.
Martin attended Howard Elementary School
and left Madera High School before he could
graduate to join the United States Army. Mar-
tin and his four brothers honorably served our
country during World War II. During his serv-
ice in the Army, Martin was deployed to
France.
Martin was awarded multiple medals for his
honored military service, including the Silver
Star, Bronze Star, and the Purple Heart. Addi-
tionally, in 2014 Martin received an honorary
high school diploma from Madera High
School. Several of these medals were in rec-
ognition of his act of bravery on a French bat-
tle field that saved the lives of 283 U.S. sol-
diers. Martin and his commander rescued sol-
diers who were pinned down by a German
machine gun nest. Despite being shot through
his shoulder and neck by a German sniper,
Martin pushed on and was only treated later
despite his injuries. After the conflict, Martin
was promoted to the rank of Sergeant.
Upon his return from military service, Martin
settled in Madera and married the love of his
life Madeline. Together they were the proud
parents of two daughters and a son. Martin
was very involved in local organizations and
forged many lifelong friendships. Martin was a
member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars
(VFW) Post 1981 of Madera and was a mem-
ber of the distinguished Honor Guard for the
post.
Martin was preceded in death by his wife
Madeline, his daughter Judie, and Grandson
Kevin. He is survived by daughter Toni, son
Reg, grandchildren Rob, Nina and Jamie, and
great grandchildren Maddie, Tommy,
Cheyanne, and Alyssa.
Madam Speaker, it is with great respect that
I ask my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in paying tribute to
honored veteran Martin Morin Medellin. His
service to our country and community will not
be forgotten.

INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION TO
SUPPORT THE GOALS AND
IDEALS OF THE AMERICAN LE-
GION ON THEIR 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY
HON. ANDRÉ CARSON
OF INDIANA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 16, 2019
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I
rise to introduce a resolution to support the
goals and ideals of the American Legion on
their 100th anniversary. The American Legion
is our country’s largest wartime veterans serv-
ice organization and has advocated for a
countless number of veterans,
servicemembers, families, and communities.
Federally chartered by Congress in 1919,
the American Legion evolved from a group of
war-hardened World War I veterans to one of
the most influential nonprofit organizations in
America today. The Legion is committed to
mentoring youth, sponsoring beneficial pro-
grams in our communities, advocating patriot-
ism and honor, promoting strong national se-
curity, and continuing devotion to our fellow
servicemembers and veterans.
The nonpartisan, not-for-profit organization
has given countless hours of service and pro-
duced millions of dollars in donations at local,
state, and national levels. While American vet-
erans have valiantly served to protect our
country and interests around the world, the
contributions from the Legion assist these vet-
erans and their families during times of need
and stand behind the issues most important to
our nation’s veterans.
The Legion now has approximately 2 million
members of the Armed Forces and veterans in
its membership in over 13,000 posts world-
wide. A gift from the people of Indiana, the
National Headquarters of The American Le-
gion is located in Indianapolis near the Indiana
War Memorial Plaza. As the Representative
for the 7th Congressional District of Indiana, I
am proud to have such an important and
meaningful organization, headquartered in In-
dianapolis, especially one that has done so
much for the well-being of our country’s vet-
erans and communities.
Among other notable members, three Hoo-
siers have served as National Commander of
the American Legion. Paul V. McNutt, George
N. Craig, and Frank I. Hamilton all served in
the highest echelons of leaderships at the Le-
gion as National Commander.
Paul McNutt was an American diplomat and
politician who served as the National Com-
mander of the American Legion (1928 to 29),
34th Governor of Indiana (1933 to 37), high
commissioner to the Philippines, administrator
of the Federal Security Agency, and Chairman
of the War Manpower Commission and am-
bassador to the Philippines.
Craig was the 39th Governor of the State of
Indiana from 1953 until 1957. A lawyer and
veteran of World War II who was promoted to
serve as a division command staff, Craig first
gained popularity in the state as National
Commander of The American Legion (1949 to
50). Craig served four years with the 80th U.S.
Infantry Division in General George Patton’s
hard-hitting Third Army. He participated in all
the bitter fighting of the Patton campaigns in
northern France, in the Rhineland, in the
Ardennes and in Germany. Through battlefield
promotions he reached the rank of Lieutenant
Colonel.
Hamilton was born in Indianapolis, the home
of American Legion National Headquarters, on
January 6, 1923. He attended public schools,
graduating from Wiley High School in Terre
Haute; earned his BS degree from Indiana
University, and received his LLB and Doctor of
Jurisprudence degrees from the Indiana Uni-
versity Law School. He enlisted in the U.S.
Army Reserve in 1942, and went on active
duty later that same year. In 1945 he was
commissioned a Second Lieutenant at the In-
fantry School in Ft. Benning, Georgia, and
served with the U.S. Army of Occupation in
Japan. He was separated from active service
in 1946 but held his commission until 1953,
when he resigned with the rank of First Lieu-
tenant.
Hamilton was a practicing attorney in his
home community of Greensburg. He was a
member of the Decatur County and Indiana
State Bar Association. He served as chairman
of the Indiana State Veterans Commission and
as a member of the Governor’s Economic
Committee of the Ninth District of Indiana.
Hamilton was extremely active in a number of
civic, fraternal, professional and service orga-
nizations including: Past Exalted Ruler, Benev-
olent Protective Order of Elks, Lodge 475;
President and Chairman of the Board of
Lambda Corporation of Sigma Chi social fra-
ternity; Chairman, Indiana University Varsity
Club of Decatur County; President, Decatur
County Bar Association, and Deacon of the
Presbyterian Church. He held membership in
many other social and fraternal organizations,
including several Masonic Orders.
Another notable figure in the Legion’s his-
tory includes former Marine Corps Lieutenant
General Carol Mutter. She is the first woman
in the history of the United States Armed
Forces to be appointed to a three-star grade.
She retired from the Marine Corps on January
1, 1999, and her last active duty assignment
was as Deputy Chief of Staff, Manpower and
Reserve Affairs (DC/S, M&RA) at Marine
Corps Headquarters in Washington, D.C. Mut-
ter currently resides in Indianapolis, Indiana
and is a member of Legion Post 438.
Finally, I applaud The American Legion for
its more recent efforts in recognizing the mili-
tary contribution of African-Americans and
working to reflect that historical contribution in
their leadership ranks. For example, Willie D.
Ransom was appointed national sergeant-at-
arms of The American Legion on August 30,
2018, at the 100th National Convention in Min-
neapolis. The sergeant-at-arms preserves the
order at national meetings and performs such
other duties as may be assigned by the Na-
tional Executive Committee or national offi-
cers.
A Vietnam-era veteran, Mr. Ransom retired
from the U.S. Army as a master sergeant.
Willie is a member of Maj. Charles A. Ransom
American Legion Post 186 in Midlothian, Va.
The post was named in honor of Willie’s son,
U.S. Air Force Maj. Charles A. Ransom, who
was killed in action on April 27, 2011, while
serving in Kabul, Afghanistan. Willie is a past
department commander of Virginia and has
also served as the Veterans Affairs and Reha-
bilitation chairman for the department.
I recognize the organization and its mem-
bers for their unrelenting dedication to improv-
ing the lives of servicemembers and veterans
across the country. With the American Le-
gion’s success depending on active member-
ship, participation, and volunteerism, I look for-
ward to working alongside the organization to
ensure another 100 years of excellence.
I urge my colleagues to join me in passing
this resolution to recognize The American Le-
gion on its 100th anniversary.

RECOGNIZING VERMALENE
SMITH’S VSO SERVICE
HON. ERIC A. ‘‘RICK’’ CRAWFORD
OF ARKANSAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 16, 2019
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise
today in recognition of Vermalene Smith of
Jonesboro, Arkansas, who faithfully served as
the Craighead County Veterans Service Offi-
cer the past 12 years. Without a doubt, our
country’s 18-plus million veterans would be
much better served if every VSO had Ms.
Smith’s knowledge, determination, and pas-
sion.
When I first took office in 2011, Ms. Smith
literally opened her office doors to my vet-
eran’s caseworker, allowing her to observe
and learn the VA processes so we could best
serve veterans in the first congressional dis-
trict of Arkansas. Since then, Ms. Smith read-
ily made herself available to my office, offering
us advice and direction when veterans experi-
enced complex issues or bureaucratic red
tape.
If a veteran had a need, Ms. Smith pin-
pointed a resource to fill it. She often located
suits or clean clothes for veterans facing job
interviews. She found places for veterans to
live while in transition, even contacting local
hotels to provide lodging. She made sure no
veteran was buried without a proper funeral.
And in situations where Ms. Smith did not
have an available resource, she organized ef-
forts to create one.

Yes, finding Ms. Smith’s replacement will
prove daunting. She, however, leaves behind
the most treasured legacy of all—that of in-
vesting in people, including the veterans for
whom she cares so deeply and the individuals
seeking to help them. Consequently, I have no
doubt Craighead County is left in good hands
based on the leadership example Ms. Smith
set.
My office formally congratulates Ms.
Vermalene Smith on her retirement, and we
wish her many happy years ahead reflective of
the stellar service she provided veterans in
Northeast Arkansas.

HONORING THE SERRANO FAMILY
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 16, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the Serrano Family, who have been rec-
ognized as honorees at this year’s Harvest of
Hope Dinner by Catholic Charities in Merced,
California. Their strong faith and commitment
to serving others have distinguished them as
stellar members of their church community
that are very deserving of this recognition.
David Serrano was born to Florencio and
Anita Serrano on August 13, 1941. The family
lived in Chowchilla, California before moving
across the highway to Le Grand in the late
50’s when the family purchased their farm.
Raised in a family with a strong Catholic faith,
David joined the Newman Club while attending
Fresno State, where he met his future wife,
RoseAnn Burkhart, who had also grown up in
a strong Catholic household and was an inte-
gral member of their parish, Our Lady of
Lourdes (OLL).
The commitment to faith exhibited by David
and RoseAnn guided them as they raised their
family and instilled this faith in each of their
children: Christine, Danielle, Matthew, and Mi-
chael. Their family remained active in the OLL
parish throughout their childhood and volun-
teered for various ministries in the church.
David and RoseAnn became mentors for
many and over the years, were asked to be
Godparents for multiple children and adults.
David and RoseAnn’s unwavering commit-
ment to their religion undoubtedly contributed
to the strong character present in each of their
children, all of whom continue to remain active
in the Catholic faith. Each of their children has
remained committed to passing their faith tra-
ditions along to the next generation while con-
tinuing to serve others.
Their daughters Christine and Danielle, in
addition to their son Michael, his wife Erika
and daughter Catalina, are all active members
of OLL. Christine and Danielle continue to
pass along their family’s faith traditions as
Godparents to Catalina. Their son Matthew
and his wife Kimberly are active in Sacred
Heart Schools, where their children Isabela
and William attend. Though RoseAnn passed
suddenly on June 25, 2017, her exceptional
family continues to carry on her legacy she
built.
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
join me in honoring an exceptional family that
has been guided by their strong Catholic and
distinguished service to their community. I
wish the Serrano family and Catholic Charities
of Merced the best as they are recognized as
honorees at the 2019 Harvest of Hope Dinner.

RECOGNIZING THE CLEAR LAKE
AME CHURCH FOR ITS CHRIS-
TIAN MINISTRY
HON. BRIAN BABIN
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 16, 2019
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the Clear Lake African Methodist
Episcopal Church (AME) for nearly three dec-
ades of Christian ministry in the Clear Lake
area of Houston, Texas, and the dedication of
their new church home. The church is grow-
ing, both in membership and spiritual richness,
and has embraced its mission statement,
‘‘Kingdom Building, One Soul at a Time.’’
The first meeting to organize an AME
church in the Clear Lake City area began with
prayer and praise on August 18, 1992, in the
home of Reverend Brenda Payne and her
family. Bro. Jerry Payne led the praise service,
Presiding Elder X.L. Williams of the South
Houston District read the scripture, and Rev.
Payne offered prayer. There were nine adults
and five children present at the very first wor-
ship service.
In October 1992, at the Texas Annual Con-
ference held at Shiloh AME Church in Gal-
veston, Texas, Bishop John R. Bryant formally
gave Rev. Brenda Payne an appointment to
begin a mission church in the Clear Lake
area. On November 29, 1992, Clear Lake
AME held its first 11 AM worship service at
the Piper’s Meadow Community Center in
Webster, Texas. Bible study continued initially
in the home of the pastor until it was moved
to the Piper’s Meadow Community Center in
July 1993. Clear Lake added Sunday Church
School at Piper’s Meadow on January 9,
1994.
On March 3, 1995, Clear Lake AME glorified
God for the first time in a new ‘‘home’’ located
on El Camino Real road. The Nehemiah Min-
istry, under the direction of Wilbert Williams,
built an altar and carpeted the pulpit area,
helping to transform the former office space
into a church sanctuary. On April 16, 1996,
Clear Lake AME Church purchased 3.5 acres
near the NASA Johnson Space Center and
the University of Houston—Clear Lake. This
land is believed to be the first church property
purchased by African Americans in the historic
Clear Lake area.
In October 1999, Clear Lake AME Church
joined with Primm Chapel AME Church,
LaMarque, Reedy Chapel AME Church, Gal-
veston, and St. James AME Church, Dickin-
son to form the ‘‘Mainland 4.’’ The four
churches, though small in numerical size,
hosted the Texas Annual Conference.
At the 134th Session of the Texas Annual
Conference in October 2000, Bishop McKinley
Young appointed Rev. Arthur Ferguson Pastor
of Clear Lake AME Church. Rev. Arthur Fer-
guson preached the gospel of peace, love,
and reconciliation, preparing the church to
grow and become a beacon in the Clear Lake
community.
On Saturday, November 18, 2006, at the
Post Conference Planning Meeting of the
Texas Annual Conference, Bishop Gregory
G.M. Ingram, Presiding Prelate, appointed
Reverend Kevin L. Hodge to serve as Pastor
of Clear Lake AME Church. Pastor Hodge and
his new bride, First Lady LaShawn Hodge,
came with a vision to take the congregation
‘‘to the next level’’ of spiritual growth, church
construction, and church expansion. On Sun-
day, July 1, 2007, Clear Lake AME moved the
congregation to its current location on Sea
Lark Road.
On Sunday, February 17, 2013, Bishop
Vashti Murphy McKenzie moved Pastor and
Sister Hodge to a ministry at Shiloh AME
Church in Galveston, Texas. On Saturday,
March 8, 2013, Reverend Derrick Cyprian was
appointed Pastor of Clear Lake AME Church.
Rev. Cyprian, his wife Chalita, and their two
sons, Derrick and Jared, came with excite-
ment and a desire to help the community
reach their committed goals: to grow spir-
itually, increase God’s kingdom, and build a
home sanctuary to house Clear Lake AME
Church ministries.
The Clear Lake African Methodist Episcopal
Church is committed to fulfilling the Great
Commission through worship, fellowship,
youth programs, outreach initiatives, and
Christian education. The Lord has used this
church as an amazing witness, and we are
privileged to have such a place of worship in
the 36th Congressional District of Texas.

his retirement.
For the last six years, John Rudd has
served as the President and CEO of Cayuga
Medical Center. Upon its creation in 2014,
John was also named President and CEO of
Cayuga Health System. Before that, John

and wealth of experience has ensured the
highest of quality service, that Cayuga Medical
Center is known for, to people in the Finger
Lakes Region.
Under John’s leadership, Cayuga Medical
Center has grown and experienced a major
expansion of their services. He oversaw the
opening of the Cayuga Wellness Center as
well as the opening of the hospital’s first cath
lab. John is responsible for forging partner-
ships and collaboration with organizations
such as Mayo Laboratories, University of
Rochester Medical Center, and Roswell Park.
He was also instrumental in the efforts to join
Cayuga Medical Center and Schuyler Hospital
as Cayuga Health System, producing a suc-
cessful system with both hospitals performing
well.
John’s dedication to the well-being of his
community extends far beyond his place of
work, as he has served on numerous commu-
nity boards. He has worked with organizations
such as Franziska Racker Centers, OAR,
United Way Tompkins County, Tompkins

CELEBRATING THE 150TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE AI ROOT COM-
PANY
HON. ANTHONY GONZALEZ
OF OHIO
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 16, 2019
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I
rise to pay tribute to Root Candles of Medina,
Ohio on their 150th anniversary. Founded in
1869, this family owned, and operated com-
pany has consistently produced the highest
quality candles our country has to offer. Now
in its fifth generation, the Root family con-
tinues to uphold the same values that their
founder, Amos Ives Root, first instilled: hon-
esty, integrity, and diligent craftsmanship.
Today, Root Candles continues to be a
leader of industry; combining the latest tech-
nology in manufacturing with five generations
of mastered craftsmanship to create un-
matched fragrances and sophisticated color
palettes. With their rich history, tradition of ex-
cellence, and commitment to customer satis-
faction, the next 150 years are sure to be just
as successful as the last.
I am pleased to have this opportunity to
share the history of Root Candles with the
House and want to join in congratulating them
and their fine employees as they prepare to
celebrate 150 years of service to the people
and communities of Northeast Ohio.

IN HONOR OF AMERICAN LEGION
POST 12
HON. ANDY BARR
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 16, 2019
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor the American Legion ‘‘Jesse M. Dykes’’
Post 12 in Richmond, Kentucky. Post 12 is
celebrating its 100th anniversary on August
17, 2019. The Post is celebrating this impor-
tant anniversary by dedicating a memorial to
veterans.
Post 12 has a long and important history in
the Richmond community. After the American
Legion was organized, a group of veterans in
Richmond decided to apply for a post charter
in August of 1919. They were the 12th Post
chartered in Kentucky. Lt. Harry D. Rice led
efforts to secure the charter for Post 12 and
was later named the first Post Commander.
The Post’s name, Jesse M. Dykes, is in
honor of the first Madison County soldier killed
in action in WWI. Dykes was killed in battle in
the Argonne Forest on October 4, 1918. He
was buried in France and later reinterred in
the Richmond Cemetery.
The American Legion provides a voice for
veterans at the national level, builds future
leaders through youth programs such as Boys
State, supports young people in the commu-
nity, provides camaraderie with fellow veterans
and patriotic Americans, and much more. The
present commander of Post 12 is Cecil Walk-
er.
I thank Commander Walker and all past and
present members of American Legion ‘‘Jesse
M. Dykes’’ Post 12 for their service to our
country. I am grateful for their work through
American Legion to honor and serve their fel-
low veterans. It is my honor to recognize them
on this 100th anniversary before the United
States Congress.

IN CELEBRATION OF FRANK
GARCIA’S BIRTHDAY
HON. J. LUIS CORREA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 16, 2019
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today
to honor the 75th birthday of Frank Garcia, my
constituent, friend, and the founder and owner
of La Casa Garcia.
Mr. Garcia and his wife, Sylvia Garcia,
opened La Casa Garcia in 1973 and have
since expanded to three locations in Orange
County. La Casa Garcia and its authentic, de-
lectable Mexican food has become a staple in
our community over the past four decades.
Beyond being a successful restaurateur, Mr.
Garcia has also become a well-known philan-
thropist in Orange County as the founder of
the We Give Thanks Foundation. Mr. Garcia’s
passion for giving back earned him the Points
of Light Foundation Medal from former Presi-
dent Bill Clinton. In addition, his restaurant, La
Casa Garcia, received the designation of
‘‘Small Business of the Year’’ from California
State Senator Tom Umberg.
Mr. Garcia began his career in the res-
taurant industry at the young age of 13 as a
dishwasher in a restaurant in Texas. He also
worked in the fields picking cotton and onion
with his father, Luis Majin Garcia. During his
time as a dishwasher, Mr. Garcia worked hard
to master cooking skills and was soon pro-
moted to chef himself. It was through these
formative experiences that Mr. Garcia learned
the value of hard work, the power of food as
a way of bonding, and the importance of con-
necting with the community. Mr. Garcia credits
God for his success and expresses his grati-
tude through every meal that he serves.
Growing up, his mother, Elvira Garza Gar-
cia, one of the founders of LULAC, instilled in
him a strong sense of philanthropy. After the
success of La Casa Garcia, Mr. Garcia fol-
lowed his mother’s philosophy of charity and
founded We Give Thanks Inc., a nonprofit that
has been hosting a Thanksgiving feast every
year for the past 32 years. The annual We
Give Thanks feast began as a small-scale
event attended by a few thousand people in
the parking lot of one of the La Casa Garcia
restaurants. Since then, it has expanded to
the lot of the Honda Center, where 1,500 vol-
unteers serve around 17,000 people each
year. It has become the largest Thanksgiving
feast hosted in Orange County. Mr. Garcia’s
dedication to serving others also extends be-
yond Orange County; when Hurricane Harvey
hit Houston, Texas in 2017, Mr. Garcia partici-
pated in efforts to raise money for victims and
personally flew out to Houston to provide hot
meals for those in need and displaced by the
hurricane.
In his 75 years of life, Mr. Garcia has be-
come a beacon of light for the Orange County
community. He is a constant and consistent
supporter of numerous community events and
has become known for his community service
and volunteer work. His dedication for pro-
viding quality food and his passion for helping
others brings warmth and comfort to the lives
of Orange County locals every day. Mr. Gar-
cia’s story is a moving example of the power
of hard work, dedication, and charity. For
these reasons, I ask my colleagues to join me
in wishing Mr. Garcia many more years of
health, success, and prosperity and in thank-
ing him for his invaluable contributions and
presence in our community. Happy Birthday.

HONORING CHANCELLOR DOROTHY
LELAND
HON. JIM COSTA
OF CALIFORNIA
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 16, 2019
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor Chancellor Dorothy Leland on her last
day as Chancellor of the University of Cali-
fornia, Merced. Chancellor Leland leaves a
legacy of leadership and advocacy.
After earning her bachelors, masters, and
PhD from Purdue University, Chancellor Le-
land began an impressive career in academia
and became the President of Georgia College
& State University in 2004. Though she had
planned to retire in that job, she answered the
call to serve as UC Merced’s chancellor in
2011 because she was intrigued about leading
a young university.
When Chancellor Leland arrived at UC
Merced, the university lacked the resources
and infrastructure present at more established
schools and California’s education budget was
still severely impacted by the recession. Chan-
cellor Leland rose to these unique challenges
and envisioned the 2020 Project: one that
brought together $1.3 billion of state and pri-
vate funding to significantly increase the size
of campus and provide the necessary facilities
to support the longterm growth of this premier
21st century research university.
Upon completion, the 2020 Project will add
classroom space, student housing, student life
facilities and more labs that will further the
University of California’s mission to improve
and advance society through research. The
changes will accommodate 10,000 students.
Chancellor Leland has been an outspoken
advocate for underserved student populations
during her tenure. UC Merced is a minority-
majority campus-many students are the first in
their family to attend college. Under her lead-
ership, UC Merced has implemented programs
and initiatives to support these students.
Chancellor Leland has championed the cam-
pus’s Dreamers and has even traveled to
Washington, D.C. to advocate on their behalf.
As the leader of the UC’s newest campus,
Chancellor Leland has fostered relationships
to ensure UC Merced’s positive impact on the
future of the San Joaquin Valley. Under her
guidance, the university has increased its visi-
bility in the Merced community with its Down-
town Campus Center, which opened in early

cation who has paved the way for the suc-
cessful future of UC Merced and the San Joa-
quin Valley. I am proud to join Chancellor Le-
land as University of California Merced cele-

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE ANN ARBOR
FARMERS MARKET
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL
OF MICHIGAN
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 16, 2019
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise
today to recognize the 100th anniversary of
the Ann Arbor Farmers Market. It is my honor
and privilege to recognize its century of dedi-
cation and service to the Ann Arbor commu-
nity.
Since 1919, the Ann Arbor Farmers Market
has striven to connect local businesses with
members of the Ann Arbor community. Every
week, the market invites vendors to sell fresh
produce, flowers, artisanal products, baked
goods, crafts, and a host of other Michigan
goods. All products are sold exclusively by the
people who grow or make them, allowing pro-
ducers and community members to establish
meaningful and lasting relationships with one
another. People in the Ann Arbor area are in-
vited to stroll the farmers market year-round to
experience all it has to offer.
Over the course of 100 years, the Ann
Arbor Farmers Market has significantly trans-
formed. From humble beginnings on 4th Ave-
nue in Ann Arbor in 1919, the farmers market
has since grown to become a pillar of our
community. Today, the farmers market creates
a space for over 100 vendors and countless
community members to gather. In addition, the
farmers market hosts an array of additional
special events for all of Ann Arbor to enjoy.
Throughout the year, members of our commu-
nity look forward to the food truck rallies, live
music opportunities, cooking demonstrations,
and holiday gatherings that the farmers market
offers. The Ann Arbor Farmers Market truly
fosters an inclusive, lively, and enjoyable envi-
ronment where all feel welcome, and I cannot
thank it enough for its century of exceptional
service to our community.
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join
me today in honoring the 100th anniversary of
the Ann Arbor Farmers Market. We are grate-
ful for its impactful contributions to our com-
munity and wish it many more years of contin-
ued success.

RECOGNIZING THE MINISTRY AND
SERVICE OF REVEREND ARLESS
R. GLASS
HON. BRIAN BABIN
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 16, 2019
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
recognize the service and ministry of Rev-
erend Bishop Arless R. Glass who has served
the Lord in ministry for nearly seven decades
at the United Pentecostal Church International.
Arless Glass was born to Robert Newton
and Allie Glass on August 17, 1929, in
DeRidder, Louisiana. He graduated from
DeRidder High School in 1947.
Shortly after high school, Glass joined the
United States Air Force and served as a Wel-
fare Supervisor in the Chaplaincy with rota-
tions at Kadena Air Force Base in Okinawa,
Japan, in 1951 and Carswell Air Force Base
in 1953. Chaplain Glass was the first person
to baptize someone in Jesus’ name while sta-
tioned in Okinawa.
Following his honorable service in the Air
Force, Arless Glass was licensed as a min-
ister in the United Pentecostal Church in Feb-
ruary of 1951 and ordained in July of 1953.
Initially, Glass served as an evangelist across
the United States and Canada. In November
of 1956, Rev. Glass accepted the pastorate of
the La Marque United Pentecostal Church in
Texas.
In August of 1962, the Lord called Arless
Glass to the Pasadena United Pentecostal
Church where he has served ever since. He
served as pastor of Pasadena United Pente-
costal Church for forty-two years. For the past
fifteen years, he has also served as Bishop of
The Church Triumphant.
Rev. Glass was one of the founding fathers
of the Texas Bible College in 1964 and served
as an instructor from 1964 to 1970, as well as
a member on the Board of Directors from
1964 to 1976. Glass also earned a Bachelor
of Theology degree from Texas Bible College
in 1975. He later received an honorary doc-
toral degree in Pentecostal Studies in 1991,
from the Apostolic Bible Institute in St. Paul,
Minnesota. In 2008, Bishop Glass earned his
Master’s in Apostolic Studies from World
Academy of Letters.
In addition to his day-to-day role as a pas-
tor, Bishop Glass has served in countless
other denominational leadership positions on
the local, state, and national level within the
United Pentecostal Church International. He
has also served as an appointed police chap-
lain for the Pasadena Police Department from
1974 to the present-day. Glass was also an
active member of the United States Air
Forces’ Auxiliary, commonly known as the
Civil Air Patrol, from 1974 to 2006 where he
served as a Lieutenant Colonel.
After forty-two years of marriage, his wife,
Geraldine, passed away. He later married
JoAnn Cannon, who passed away in 2002.
Bishop Glass is currently married to Joan
Carouthers of Arlington, Texas. He is the fa-
ther of three children, daughters Cathy Glass
and Letha Wise (deceased) and son Richey
Glass. Glass has six grandchildren: Arlessa
Wise, Kayci Dougherty, Garrett Dennard, Tay-
lor Wise, Chelsea Wappler, and Krislyn Glass.
He also has three great-grandchildren: Adalyn
Sonnier, Grayson Dougherty, and Shay
Corossan.
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize
my brother in Christ, Bishop Arless R. Glass,
for his devotion to ministry, service to the
community and nation, and in recognition of
his 90th birthday on Saturday, August 17,
2019.
IN HONOR OF CHARLIE BEACH III
HON. ANDY BARR
OF KENTUCKY
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 16, 2019
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to
honor a special man, Mr. Charlie Beach III, of
Beattyville, Kentucky. This year marks Mr.
Beach’s 50th year with People’s Exchange
Bank.
People’s Exchange Bank was founded in
1912 by Charlie Beach, Sr. where he served
from 1912 to 1966. Charlie Beach III, grand-

Chairman of the Board of Directors and is re-
sponsible for business development and public

of young people and their families, providing a
sense of community, care and stability.
We also recognize Aaron ‘‘Cliff’’ Webster,
the Executive Director of Kingman, for over 40
years of leadership. His background managing
multifaceted programs on a shoestring budget
has made him essential to maintaining the
success of Kingman over the years. Mr. Web-
ster has successfully led Kingman through dif-
ficult and changing times with a commitment
to nurturing D.C.’s youth. He has worked to
create an environment where young people
can thrive in their academic and athletic pur-
suits, and we thank Mr. Webster for being a

WELCOMING CHIEF MINISTER Y.S.
JAGAN MOHAN REDDY TO NORTH
TEXAS
HON. KENNY MARCHANT
OF TEXAS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 16, 2019
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I stand
today in recognition of India’s newly-elected
Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Y.S. Jagan
Mohan Reddy. It is my honor to congratulate
him on his recent election and to welcome him
on his visit to Dallas, Texas on August 17,
2019.
The Chief Minister’s visit represents an on-
going effort to promote economic development
between the United States and India, and his
participation will help facilitate a discussion
about business opportunities that currently
exist between both countries. This bilateral re-
lationship that has been fostered over the
years has proven especially valuable to the
economies of Texas and Andhra Pradesh,
both of which benefit from strong business
ties.
The 24th District of Texas is home to a
booming information technology industry,
world-class medical facilities, and the Dallas/
Fort Worth International Airport. It is also
home to a large Indian-American population,
many of whom immigrated from Andhra
Pradesh and have contributed to the District’s
status as a magnet for world-class profes-
sionals. Cultivating a mutually beneficial rela-
tionship is clearly valuable to the economies of
Texas and Andhra Pradesh and we look for-
ward to the continued collaboration between
our countries.
Madam Speaker, I ask all my distinguished
colleagues to join me in welcoming Chief Min-
ister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to the United
States of America and to the great to the
State of Texas.
NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGE
VITALIZATION ACT
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO
SABLAN
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 16, 2019
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Native American Language Vital-
ization Act, which would help preserve the in-
digenous languages of the United States
through grants to postsecondary institutions to
support Native American language education
programs and the pipeline of language instruc-
tors.
Native American languages are part of our
nation’s cultural heritage and are as diverse
as the rich cultures of American Indians, Alas-
ka Natives, Native Hawaiians and the Native
peoples of the Pacific U.S. territories. Over the
course of our nation’s history, Native Ameri-
cans have faced discrimination and govern-
ment policies that restricted or banned the use
of their indigenous languages. These policies
have contributed to the decline in speakers of
Native American languages. Without action,
many of these languages, from Chamorro to
Refaluwasch to Cherokee, are at risk of dis-
appearing. Congress recognized this urgency
in passing the Esther Martinez Act in 2006 to
strengthen Native American language immer-
sion programs. However, we must do more at
the postsecondary level so that future genera-
tions have the programs and quality instruc-
tors necessary to not only preserve but in-
crease the use of their ancestral languages.
The Native American Language Vitalization
Act invests in indigenous language education
by creating a dedicated grant program under
the Higher Education Act to provide the re-
sources Native-serving colleges and univer-
sities need to develop or strengthen their in-
digenous language programs. Schools can
use the grant to provide in-service training for
language teachers, develop curriculum, pro-
fessional development of faculty, and create
innovative programs, including language im-
mersion. Eligible institutions can also partner
with other organizations to reach students in
early childhood education programs through
grade 12.
I thank Representatives SCHRIER, GABBARD
and CASE for cosponsoring the bill. I urge my
colleagues to support this legislation to help
preserve the indigenous languages of the
United States for future generations.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 150TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE GRAND IL-
LUMINATION CELEBRATION
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING
OF MASSACHUSETTS
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, August 16, 2019
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today
in recognition of the 150th anniversary of the
Grand Illumination celebration in Oak Bluffs,
Massachusetts.
Each year, since 1869, friends, family, and
visitors to the island have gathered in the Oak
Bluffs Campgrounds to share in this wonderful
tradition. What started as an annual ceremony
welcome the Governor of Massachusetts to
Martha’s Vineyard has become the vibrant and
beloved celebration that we know today. Led
by the Martha’s Vineyard Camp Meeting Asso-
ciation, those who live in the beautiful Vic-
torian cottages lining the campground, deco-
rate their houses with scores of colorful lan-
terns. Many of the lanterns have been passed
down from friends and families for genera-
tions, with some in use for over 100 years.
As the Grand Illumination evening settles in,
thousands of people come to the Oak Bluffs
Campgrounds to observe the quiet beauty of
the dancing lights before them. Neighbors and
strangers alike share a serene and spiritual
moment of reflection and contemplation as the
Grand Illumination ignites the dark night. For
150 years, the people of Oak Bluffs have set
an example of togetherness and community
for others around the country, setting aside
any differences in a show of unity—especially
in challenging times when our nation has been
in need of unity.
Madam Speaker, on this milestone 150th
anniversary of the Grand Illumination, I am
proud to honor the Martha’s Vineyard Camp
Meeting Association and the people of Oak
Bluffs for their dedication to unity and tradition
in the community. I ask that my colleagues
join me in thanking those who have organized
the event, the Martha’s Vineyard Camp Meet-
ing Association and all those who have helped
to make it happen. I wish them all the best in
the many years to come.

ding anniversary on their native island of
Terceira. Mr. and Mrs. Neves are great pillars
in their community and act as examples to us
all with the longevity of their marriage and
their commitment to their children and the

Frank and Natalia were born and met on the
small island of Terceira in the Azores Archi-
pelago off the coast of Portugal. In 1969 the
Neves left Terceira and their dairy farm which
they had owned for 10 years and immigrated
to the United States. After they arrived in the
United States, they settled in the small town of
Hilmar, in the San Joaquin Valley. Once in
Hilmar, Frank and Natalia started their family
and extensive community service.
Throughout her career, Natalia worked at
the local Foster Farms plant in Livingston for
over 30 years. Frank was the plant manager
of Besnier USA for 23 years. Natalia and
Frank are the proud parents of three children,
Frank, Lee and Leanna. Frank went on to be
a Police Officer, Leanna received her master’s
degree and currently works for EJ Gallo Win-
ery and Lee received his law degree and now
works as a political consultant. They have 5
grandchildren, one of which, served as the
California Dairy Princess, representing and ad-
vocating for the Dairy industry on local and
state levels. Their children credit their success
in life to their parents’ commitment and dedi-
cation.
