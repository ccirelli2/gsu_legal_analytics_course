Vol. 165 WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 2019 No. 178
House of Representatives
The House was not in session today. Its next meeting will be held on Friday, November 8, 2019, at 1 p.m.
Senate
THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 2019
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was
called to order by the President pro
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).
f
PRAYER
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The
prayer will be given by the Senator
from Oklahoma, Mr. INHOFE. He will
lead us in prayer.
Mr. INHOFE. Let us pray.
Almighty God, Creator of all, as we
gather here today, we are grateful for
the servicemembers who are deployed
in the defense of our great Nation
under God. We ask for Your comfort for
the families who continue their duties
at home with the courage to maintain
the homefront in the absence of their
loved ones.
Protect our service men and women
with the shield of Your strength as
they discharge their sacred mission,
and keep them safe from all evil and
harm. May the power of Your love en-
able them to return home in safety,
that with all who love them, they may
ever praise You for Your loving care.
Assist with Your spirit of counsel and
fortitude for the President and other
government leaders of these United
States. May they always seek the ways
of righteousness, justice, and mercy.
Grant that they may be enabled by
Your powerful protection to lead our
country with honesty and integrity.
Lord, we know all too well our weak
and infallible human nature, and we
recognize that the work which lies be-
fore us is demanding and complex. Yet,
O God, I thank You for calling us to
this difficult and rewarding work.
Lead our troops and all of us, O Lord,
in the way of peace. Unite us in the
spirit of service.
We pray these things in the Name of
our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
Amen.
f
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
The President pro tempore led the
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
CRAMER). The Senator from Iowa.
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak in morn-
ing business for 1 minute.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
f
VETERANS DAY
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this
year on Veterans Day, I will join all
Americans in honoring those who have
served in our Armed Forces. As a na-
tion, we owe those who have served a
debt of gratitude for the sacrifices they
have made to protect our country, our
way of life, and the principles of liberty
and natural rights. Too often, we for-
get to thank the families who are left
behind while they are in service. They
deserve our consideration as well.
The least we can do in return is work
to ensure that all veterans have the
healthcare and benefits they have
earned. We owe it to veterans to ensure
that they are never forsaken, nor for-
gotten.
I yield the floor.
f
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY
LEADER
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.
f
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, this
week, the Senate will continue to con-
firm President Trump’s well-qualified
judicial nominees. This President and
this Senate have prioritized confirming
impressive men and women to these
lifetime appointments—talented indi-
viduals who believe in the quaint no-
tion that the job of a judge is to apply
our Nation’s laws and Constitution as
they were actually written, not as they
might wish they were written.
At the close of business today, it so
happens, one in every four judges on
the Federal courts of appeals will have
been nominated by President Trump
and confirmed by us here in the Sen-
ate.
There is nothing about this that
ought to be viewed as a partisan ac-
complishment or an accomplishment
only for this President or only for one
side. That is the wrong way to look at
it. Every American should be proud of
this. Citizens deserve a judiciary of
fairminded men and women who don’t
confuse their jobs with the job of a leg-
islator. Every Member of this body
should be proud to confirm Federal
judges who understand that our job is
to make the laws, and their job is to
apply them fairly.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6454 November 7, 2019
If the concept of faithful judges ful-
filling their proper role strikes anyone
as a partisan development or a threat
to their political agenda, I would sug-
gest it is their agenda that needs modi-
fying and not the judicial branch that
our Founders intended.
f
COAL INDUSTRY
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on
another matter, one of the untold sto-
ries of the Obama administration was
the dramatic geographic inequality
that deepened on the Democrats’
watch.
From 2010 to 2016, the Nation’s larg-
est metro areas captured nearly 75 per-
cent of the new jobs and 90 percent of
the population growth. Big cities did
OK, but unfair and regressive policies,
like the War on Coal, left many other
communities—smaller cities, small
towns, and rural areas—literally in the
dust.
Homegrown American energy, includ-
ing coal, has supported entire commu-
nities in Kentucky and throughout the
country for generations, but even be-
fore he took office, President Obama
declared a war on coal. Here is what he
said: ‘‘If somebody wants to build a
coal-fired power plant, they can; it is
just that it will bankrupt them.’’
Of course, that approach didn’t only
hurt American businesses, it hurt
American workers. In 2009, 23,000 Ken-
tuckians made their living mining
coal. By the end of 2016, that number
had dropped to barely more than 6,500.
It went from 23,000 to 6,500 during the
Obama years. Nearly three-quarters of
the State’s coal jobs were gone in the
span of one Presidency.
So since the earliest days of the
Trump administration, we have
prioritized ending the War on Coal and
trying to repair the damage. We have
repealed hostile regulations and cre-
ated tailwinds instead of headwinds for
America’s energy dominance. But 8
years of damage is not easy to unwind.
Many coal communities are still suf-
fering. There are more mine closures
and more bankruptcies. Workers’ pay-
checks and retirees’ pensions are
thrown into uncertainty. So our work
continues.
A few years back, I worked to secure
permanent health benefits for thou-
sands of retirees. Yesterday, a bipar-
tisan group here in the Senate, led by
Senators CAPITO, MANCHIN, and me,
took a major step toward addressing
the emergency of underfunded pensions
for thousands of miners, retirees, and
their families. We introduced new leg-
islation to expand that healthcare fix
to include 13,000 more miners and pro-
tect the pensions of nearly 92,000 min-
ers into the future.
Earlier this week, I personally raised
the subject with President Trump. We
discussed the importance of working
toward a solution for these retirees.
Just yesterday, I hosted Kentucky
miners here in the Capitol to hear their
concerns and discuss a potential path
forward.
I have spent my entire career in the
Senate fighting for all Kentuckians. I
have worked to protect coal commu-
nities from bad ideas and to promote
their future, and I will keep working
with the Trump administration and my
colleagues on both sides to support our
mining families.
f
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now on another
matter, Mr. President, earlier this
week, the Securities and Exchange
Commission took a significant step
into the 21st century. When public
companies put business decisions up for
a vote by their shareholders, it stands
to reason that large asset managers
who own many shares on behalf of
their clients have enormous power to
determine the outcome. Since these in-
stitutional investors lack the band-
width to study every single company in
great detail, many rely heavily on out-
side advisory firms.
In principle, there is nothing wrong
with institutional investors getting ad-
vice, but in practice, things get pretty
interesting. This cottage industry of
proxy advisory firms is extremely con-
centrated in a very few hands. I believe
the two largest firms have something
like 97 percent market share between
them, and their advice is often taken
uncritically. One analysis of major
asset managers found that 95 percent of
their voting followed one advisory
firm’s recommendation.
So we have a small concentration of
voices wielding enormous power over
American business, and questions have
arisen about whether they really exer-
cise that power to serve the best finan-
cial interests of the investors. In some
cases, the proxy advisers seem less in-
terested in the particular interests of
the particular company and more in-
terested in advancing a preconceived
ideological agenda. In other words,
these firms are accused of leveraging
their incredible influence to force cor-
porations to conform to their own vi-
sion of social justice.
That is why, as the Chairman of the
SEC explained, he receives letters from
ordinary American investors express-
ing ‘‘concern that their financial in-
vestments, including their retirement
funds, were being steered by third par-
ties to promote individual agendas,
rather than to further their [own] pri-
mary goals’’ of saving for retirement
and leaving something behind for their
kids and grandkids.
These proxy advisers are regulated
by the SEC, and as it happens, some
parts of these rules had not been up-
dated since 1954. So this week the SEC
has updated these Eisenhower-era
guidelines for the 21st century. The
new rules will enable more trans-
parency and accountability. They will
help ensure that these powerful voices
have meaningful skin in the game and
are not simply searching for a conven-
ient vehicle to advance their pre-
conceived interests.
I applaud the step forward by Chair-
man Clayton and the SEC.
f
VETERANS DAY
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now
on one final matter, on Monday, our
Nation will observe Veterans Day.
Some will gather here in our Nation’s
Capital at the proud monuments that
pay enduring tribute to the service and
sacrifice of generations of brave serv-
icemembers. Many more will mark the
day in ceremonies in small towns and
cities across our country. And, of
course, many Americans will have vet-
erans to thank firsthand in their own
families and neighborhoods.
My own father’s Army service took
him to the heart of the battle for Eu-
rope in 1945. His company sustained
heavy losses. When he returned home,
he traded his uniform for a briefcase
and went back to work in our commu-
nity.
Perhaps the only thing more remark-
able than the heroic service that gen-
erations of veterans have offered at
home and overseas is the fact that they
come home and keep right on serving
in new ways—as fathers and mothers,
as skilled workers, as entrepreneurs, or
as educators, and in every case, as a
custodian of a unique part of our Na-
tion’s collective memory.
It is a cliche, but it is a cliche for
good reason: the land of the free be-
cause of the brave.
The Senate will not be in session on
Monday, as we honor Veterans Day,
but I hope that each of our Members
will be remembering and giving thanks
for all veterans and for those brave
men and women serving today. Their
efforts are the reason why this Cham-
ber exists, why it still stands, and why
American self-government and Amer-
ican freedom endure.

The senior assistant legislative clerk
proceeded to call the roll.
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask
unanimous consent that the order for

APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, Sen-
ate Democrats had hoped to work with
our Republican colleagues this year on
a fully bipartisan process. It got off to
a great start when the four congres-
sional leaders reached a budget deal
over the summer, but it quickly went
awry.
Senate Republicans departed from
the bipartisan process by unilaterally
proposing their own allocations to the
various agencies. This was not part of
the agreement. This was not in the
spirit or concept of the agreement. It
was always, when we agreed, that we
would work out the 302(b) allocations.
Instead, the Republicans went ahead,
unilaterally, and they proposed moving
$12 billion—$12 billion—from critical
health programs and military families
to pay for the President’s border wall,
and that was way out of bounds.
The Republican leader has accused
Democrats, myself included, of break-
ing our budget deal by not going along
with these very partisan bills. He
knows—and every Member of this
Chamber, Democrat and Republican,
knows well—that Democrats are not
going to support a unilateral move by
the Republicans to take $12 billion
away from military families, edu-
cation, opioids, and NIH and put it into
the President’s vanity, partisan wall.
So, until Republicans get serious about
negotiating a bipartisan way forward,
the partisan appropriation bills are all
we have and they cannot move forward.
Now, in the last few days, after con-
versations that I had with Leader
MCCONNELL, Speaker PELOSI, and Lead-
er MCCARTHY, we are seeing some posi-
tive signs that we can get the process
back on track. This month, Democrats
and Republicans worked through a
package of bipartisan appropriation
bills on the floor with few issues. Now,
as we speak, both parties, both sides—
Democrats and Republicans, House and
Senate appropriators—have started
talking again about restarting the
good-faith negotiations on the remain-
ing bills.
We hope this moves forward in a bi-
partisan way. Each side has to agree. I
will repeat my view. If President
Trump stays out of it, we will come to
an agreement. If President Trump
messes in, if the Republican leader
feels so in obeisance to Donald Trump,
who doesn’t have any concept of how to
get things done around here, then we
will not get it done, and we may have
a second Trump shutdown with the
leader going along, which will not suc-
ceed. It will not succeed in getting
them what they want.
So I hope that with a little effort and
compromise, we in Congress can find a
way forward on appropriations by
working together.
WHISTLEBLOWERS
Mr. President, on the whistleblower,
yesterday, the House Intelligence Com-
mittee announced the schedule for its
first week of public hearings in the
House impeachment inquiry, including
testimony from the current and former
top U.S. diplomats in Ukraine. These
public hearings are a reminder that the
whistleblower’s account has already
been corroborated many times over by
officials with firsthand knowledge of
the situation.
Yet there remains a searing focus by
the President and one Member of this
Chamber on the whistleblower. Even
though his or her account has been
verified by other sources, the White
House and, most particularly, the jun-
ior Senator from Kentucky, seem com-
mitted to discrediting the whistle-
blower, disclosing the whistleblower’s
identity, and turning the rightwing
media machine on this person—and
they can be vicious.
The junior Senator from Kentucky
went so far as to block a simple resolu-
tion from my friend the Senator from
Hawaii, MAZIE HIRONO, that would have
reconfirmed the Senate’s support for
whistleblower protection laws—laws
that have been on the books for a very
long time.
The whole concept started with the
Continental Congress, even before the
Constitution. We are going down a dan-
gerous road when Members of this body
are refusing to stand up for our Na-
tion’s laws, particularly those laws
that enforce the rule of law and make
sure our government is doing what the
people want.
These attempts to expose the whis-
tleblower are unfortunately not the
only example of how a few of my col-
leagues are taking the defense of this
President too far. It seems that with
each coming week, sometimes each
coming day, the President’s allies in
Congress come up with a new tortured
defense of his actions. House Repub-
licans have gone from attacking the
process because it was closed to at-
tacking it because it was opened. They
have gone from insisting on ‘‘no quid
pro quo’’ to saying ‘‘maybe quid pro
quo but who cares?’’
Here in the Senate, we heard a new
one from the chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, who said the Trump policy
on Ukraine was so ‘‘incoherent’’ that
the administration was ‘‘incapable of
performing a quid pro quo.’’ That is a
good one. Seriously, he said that. They
are reaching. They are reaching as far
as they can because they know that the
facts—at least as we have heard from
the House; we will wait until they
come over here, if they do—that the
facts about what the President did are
so damning.
There was even a Member of this
Chamber who went so far as to insult
the Speaker’s intelligence at a polit-
ical rally—a childish and nasty smear
that is far out of bounds.
Nobody is happy about the fact that
the House is examining the potential
impeachment of a President. It has al-
ways been a sad and somber process.
But there is no excuse for jumping to
conclusions, advocating for
lawbreaking, or resorting to nasty in-
sults. This is a time when we must
check partisanship at the door, study
the facts in the case, and make our
own independent judgments. That is
our duty. I will remind all of our col-
leagues that history will one day judge
whether or not we lived up to it.
PRESIDENT ERDOGAN
Mr. President, on ISIS, next week
President Trump will welcome Turkish
President Erdogan to the White House.
Frankly, it is confounding that Presi-
dent Trump is rolling out the welcome
mat to an autocrat whose recent ac-
tions have threatened our allies and
partners.
For over 5 years, American and coali-
tion troops, including our Syrian Kurd-
ish partners, worked shoulder to shoul-
der in northern Syria to bring ISIS to
the brink of defeat. But after the Presi-
dent’s calamitous decision to green-
light Erdogan’s military operation and
precipitously withdraw American
troops, Turkish forces and their prox-
ies have advanced far into northern
Syria, committing atrocities without
accountability. It is a shameful be-
trayal of our Syrian Kurdish partners,
and it has thrown our efforts to defeat
ISIS into chaos. At least 100 ISIS de-
tainees have reportedly broken out of
prison and disappeared, and they could
be very dangerous to us in our home-
land.
While we are glad that terrorists like
al-Baghdadi have been taken off the
field, a fundamental question remains:
What is the administration’s plan to
secure and defeat ISIS?
It is unacceptable that a month into
this crisis, the President has chosen to
welcome Erdogan to American soil be-
fore explaining to Congress his plan to
defeat ISIS. So ahead of Erdogan’s ar-
rival next week, I and several of my
Democratic colleagues are sending a
letter to President Trump demanding
that he submit to Congress a com-
prehensive plan to secure the enduring
defeat of ISIS.
There are questions that need to be
answered immediately. How many ISIS
members have been accounted for in
the wake of our withdrawal? How are
we going to stabilize former ISIS terri-
tory? What training will we give to the
forces on the ground to continue fight-
ing ISIS? These questions need to be
answered at once. They are far more
urgent than welcoming an autocrat
who just bullied the President into giv-
ing him everything that this autocrat
wanted.
NOMINATION OF STEVEN J. MENASHI

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6456 November 7, 2019
Steven Menashi of New York. His nom-
ination should not be allowed to con-
tinue.
Mr. Menashi has a very troubling
record on race, women’s equality,
LGBTG rights, and the rights of immi-
grants. His conduct before the Judici-
ary Committee was insulting, his con-
tempt for the Senate reprehensible,
and his refusal to be forthcoming about
his record is outright disqualifying.
But if members of the committee
needed any more evidence to vote
against Menashi’s nomination, they
should read this morning’s New York
Times. The headline reads ‘‘Appeals
Court Nominee Shaped DeVos’s Illegal
Loan Forgiveness Effort.’’ The Times
reports that during Mr. Menashi’s ten-
ure working with Secretary DeVos at
the Department of Education, he
played a leading role in designing an il-
legal effort to deny debt relief to thou-
sands of students swindled by for-profit
colleges.
Let me repeat. Mr. Menashi con-
cocted a plan to illegally use the pri-
vate Social Security data of defrauded
student borrowers to deny them debt
forgiveness after they were preyed
upon by for-profit schools. A Federal
judge ruled that these efforts violated
privacy laws.
This is someone the President wants
us to make an appellate court judge? A
judge is supposed to uphold the law, in-
terpret the law, and have a reverence
for the law, not someone who schemes
to break the law, as Mr. Menashi did.
Mr. Menashi’s nomination is an em-
barrassment to this country. It is an
insult to millions of hard-working
young Americans saddled with student
debt. It is an insult to women and
LGBTQ Americans, to African Ameri-
cans and immigrants, and to everyone
who believes in the rule of law.
If anyone has not earned the privi-
lege of a lifetime appointment to the
bench, it is Mr. Menashi. I urge every
Member of the Judiciary Committee to
vote against his nomination.
I yield the floor.

DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, on Tues-
day morning, I visited with Secretary
of Defense Mark Esper. We talked
about the military’s needs and national
security priorities, and we talked
about the fact that more than a month
into the new fiscal year, Congress still
hasn’t funded the military for fiscal
year 2020. We shouldn’t have needed to
talk about that. We should have passed
the Defense appropriations bill for 2020
weeks ago, but Democrats won’t let us.
Last week, Democrats blocked con-
sideration of the 2020 Defense appro-
priations bill for the second time. Ap-
parently they have every intention of
continuing to block military funding.
This is politics at its worst. And make
no mistake—this is politics. A couple
of months ago, Democrats and Repub-
licans got together and agreed on de-
fense and nondefense funding levels for
2020 and 2021. The idea was to pave the
way for the passage of appropriations
bills in a timely fashion. It seemed for
a moment that despite Democrats’ fix-
ation on partisan politics and impeach-
ment, we could actually go about fund-
ing the government and the military in
a somewhat bipartisan fashion, but ap-
parently that was too much to ask of
the Senate Democrats. Senate Demo-
crats are currently running from the
agreement, attempting to derail the
defense funding bill with poison pills
that would prevent the bill from ever
being enacted into law.
Funding our military should be the
first priority of every Member of Con-
gress. The safety of our country de-
pends on the strength of our military.
If we don’t get national security right,
the rest is conversation. Getting na-
tional security right means making
sure our military is adequately funded,
making sure we are funding the needs
of the current military and preparing
for future priorities. It should go with-
out saying that an essential part of
this responsibility is getting that fund-
ing passed in a timely fashion.
Right now, since we haven’t passed
the 2020 funding bill, the military is op-
erating under a continuing resolution
that maintains funding levels from last
year. There are multiple problems with
that.
In the first place, the military is op-
erating without all the funding it
needs. For example, the Pentagon can’t
fully support the pay increase military
members should be getting.
In addition, the continuing resolu-
tion prevents the military from start-
ing key projects that will help ensure
our men and women in uniform are pre-
pared to meet the threats of the future.
The Pentagon can’t start new procure-
ment projects. New research and devel-
opment initiatives that keep us a step
ahead of our adversaries are put on
hold.
All told, under a continuing resolu-
tion, the military’s purchasing power
is reduced by roughly $5 billion each
quarter. Five billion dollars each quar-
ter that we continue to operate under a
continuing resolution is the amount of
purchasing power that is lost to our
military to meet their critical prior-
ities. To put that in perspective, that
is the equivalent of losing out on about
56 F–35 Joint Strike Fighter planes, de-
pending on the variant, every 3
months; or nearly 2 complete Virginia-
class attack submarines, like the re-
cently commissioned USS South Da-
kota; or about 5,000 Joint Air-to-Sur-
face Standoff Missiles, like those used
to clean up the site of the Baghdadi
raid or strike Syrian chemical weapons
facilities in 2018. That $5 billion isn’t
spare change; it is funding for critical
military priorities.
In November of 2018, the bipartisan
National Defense Strategy Commission
released a report warning that our
readiness had eroded to the point
where we might struggle to win a war
against a major power, like Russia or
China. That is a dangerous situation
for our country to be in, and we need to
keep working to rebuild our military.
That starts with making sure our mili-
tary is fully funded in a timely fashion.
On the floor last week, I noted that
Democrats would like us to believe
that they are serious about legislating
and that their years-long obsession
with impeaching the President isn’t
distracting them from doing their job.
After the Democrats’ defense filibuster
last week, it is becoming clear that the
Democrats are incapable of putting
anything ahead of partisan politics, in-
cluding the safety of our country and
the well-being of our military.
It is particularly ironic that the
Democrats are blocking this defense
funding bill, which would provide $250
million in assistance to Ukraine, at the
same time they are trying to impeach
the President for allegedly delaying
Ukraine funding. Think about that.
It is hard to know what to say to my
Democrat colleagues. It should not be
this hard to convince them that fund-
ing our military is more important
than scoring points against the Presi-
dent.
I hope the leader will continue to
bring up the defense funding bill and
that enough of my Democratic col-
leagues will decide to join us in getting
this funding to our military. It is the
very least we can do for the men and
women who spend every day working
to keep us safe.
VETERANS DAY
Mr. President, Veterans Day is com-
ing up on Monday, and our Nation will
pause to remember all those who have
served in our military. I will be calling
my dad, who will be 100 in December—
a World War II vet who flew Hellcats in
the Pacific—to thank him again for his
service.
As a U.S. Senator, I have had the
privilege of meeting many veterans—
men and women who decided they were
willing to lay down their lives if nec-
essary to ensure that their families,
communities, and fellow countrymen
could enjoy the blessings of freedom.
Members of the military give up a lot
for us. They forgo physical comforts
and embrace sacrifice.
They accept long deployments and
days of duty that start before dawn or
stretch long into the night. They ac-
cept the fact that they will miss
Thanksgivings and birthdays and
Christmases, first steps and first days
of kindergarten, date nights and little

opinions in safety. It can be too easy to
forget that we enjoy these tremendous
blessings because men and women have
been willing to go out and put their
lives on the line for them.
Veterans Day is a chance to remind
ourselves—to remember that we live in
peace and freedom every day because
men and women were willing to answer
the call to serve our country. We owe
our veterans a debt we can never repay.
Yet we can make sure that we never
forget what they have done for us, and
we can resolve to lead the kinds of
lives that make us worthy of their sac-
rifice.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington.
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am
here to once again shine a spotlight on
Senate Republicans’ unwavering sup-
port for President Trump’s efforts to
remake the Federal judiciary and to
make clear how this is going to hurt
families, women, and communities in
Washington State and across our Na-
tion.
I have come here before to call out
Senate Republicans for rubberstamping
this President’s judicial nominees—
many of whom have no business sitting
on the Federal bench—and for gutting
precedent and norms to allow this
President to jam-pack our courts with
his hard-right, ideological picks from
Neil Gorsuch to Brett Kavanaugh and
down the line.
In fact, earlier this week, the major-
ity leader pointed out how Senate Re-
publicans have cleared the way on the
floor for the Senate to take up even
more Trump judges by poisoning the
appropriations process and generally
turning the Senate into a legislative
graveyard. Led by the majority leader,
Senate Republicans have ignored the
standards we have held for decades
when considering judicial nominees
and opened the door to people who lack
even the most basic qualifications to
sit on the Federal bench.
For starters, today the Senate is
slated to take up the nomination of
Lee Rudofsky for Arkansas’ Eastern
District. Mr. Rudofsky has a long his-
tory in Arkansas of working to deny
women access to reproductive
healthcare. He defended Arkansas’ law
that would ban abortion at 12 weeks as
an ‘‘ideal vehicle’’ for the Supreme
Court to ‘‘reevaluate’’ and ‘‘overturn’’
Roe v. Wade. On top of that, Mr.
Rudofsky has also previously argued in
favor of efforts to cut off Medicaid
funding to Planned Parenthood. He de-
fended a State law that could have re-
sulted in the closure of every reproduc-
tive healthcare clinic that provides
abortions in the State, and he has
worked against hard-fought progress
for equality for LGBTQIA people.
Does that sound like a judge who is
going to protect the rights of women
and others and who will put aside his
own partisan notions to ensure equal
protection under our laws for every-
one? It does not.
Take Sarah Pitlyk, whom President
Trump has nominated to a district
court in Missouri. Missouri is reeling
from this administration’s repeated at-
tacks on women’s healthcare and re-
productive health where there is cur-
rently only one clinic in the entire
State that can perform abortions. Ms.
Pitlyk has worked throughout her ca-
reer to limit access to a wide array of
reproductive healthcare services, not
just abortions. She has expressed oppo-
sition to surrogacy, in vitro fertiliza-
tion, and even the use of contraception.
To be more explicit, she called birth
control ‘‘evil’’ and a ‘‘grave moral
wrong’’—birth control. It is the 21st
century, and no matter what the ex-
treme anti-abortion men in the White
House want us to believe, birth control
is healthcare, full stop. We cannot have
judges on the bench who are so ideo-
logically driven as to think women are
morally wrong for using it.
Even beyond her rigid ideology, Ms.
Pitlyk is also woefully unfit on the
merits to become a Federal judge. In
fact, the American Bar Association
unanimously determined that Ms.
Pitlyk is ‘‘not qualified,’’ writing that
Ms. Pitlyk ‘‘has never tried a case as a
lead or co-counsel’’ and ‘‘has never ex-
amined a witness.’’
Does that sound like someone who
will uphold the rule of law justly and
apply the laws of our land fairly—
someone rated as ‘‘objectively unquali-
fied’’ and who has demonstrated no
commitment to protecting individuals’
fundamental rights? Again, unfortu-
nately, the answer is no.
Then there is Steven Menashi, whom
President Trump has nominated to the
Second Circuit Court of Appeals. We
know Mr. Menashi has a deeply dis-
turbing history of disparaging com-
ments against women, against commu-
nities of color, against immigrants,
and the LGBTQIA community. As if his
extreme views aren’t bad enough, we
know that in his role in the Office of
the General Counsel at the Department
of Education, Mr. Menashi also worked
on Secretary DeVos’s cruel rollback of
title IX protections for survivors of
sexual assault and protections for stu-
dents regardless of sex. Under his ten-
ure, Secretary DeVos has moved us to-
ward a dangerous system of
unaccountability and secrecy where
LGBTQIA students could be subject to
cruel discrimination at school.
Additionally, I am incredibly con-
cerned about Mr. Menashi’s confirmed
role in being one of the architects of
Secretary DeVos’s efforts to violate
the law by undermining protections for
student borrowers who were cheated by
predatory for-profit colleges—students
whose rights are, at this moment,
being undercut by people in our Fed-
eral Government, such as Mr. Menashi,
who should be doing just the opposite.
People deserve to trust that the
women and men who serve as our Fed-
eral judges will ensure equal protection
for all and apply the law fairly and
without bias.
I ask again: Considering Mr.
Menashi’s troubling record of under-
mining critical rights and questions
surrounding his involvement in Sec-
retary DeVos’s shameful efforts to ig-
nore the law, does he sound like some-
one who deserves a lifetime appoint-
ment to our Federal bench, someone
who will uphold our rule of law?
Confirming judges to our Federal
courts is one of our most important du-
ties as Senators. It is one that I take
very seriously. I am deeply disturbed
by the harm these individuals, if con-
firmed, may inflict upon women, on
families, and some of the most vulner-
able members of our communities.
Let me be clear about these nomina-
tions. Nothing less is at stake than the
integrity of our judicial system and the
future of our democracy. We have to
maintain the high bar we set for Fed-
eral judges, and these judges I have
mentioned are just three examples of
how far we have fallen.
It is not too late. I know my Repub-
lican colleagues know what a farce this
process has become and how supremely
unqualified these nominees are. I know
they are aware of the irreparable harm
people like these will have on the
credibility of our judicial system. That
is why we have to stop this parade of
unqualified, ideologically rigid nomi-
nees to our Federal judiciary. When it
comes to our courts, nothing is more
important than ensuring we are sus-
taining a system that people can
trust—one that upholds our laws, one
that seeks justice without bias or favor
or agenda.
I urge my colleagues to join me in re-
jecting Mr. Rudofsky’s nomination, as
well as the nominations of Ms. Pitlyk
and Mr. Menashi and any nominee of-
fered by President Trump who does not
meet our high standards, and in return-
ing to a thoughtful, rigorous, bipar-
tisan process of selecting only the most
qualified judges to a lifetime appoint-
ment on our Federal courts.
I yield the floor.

ator from Virginia.
VETERANS DAY
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise
today to say just a word about Vet-
erans Day, but then to talk about our
Nation’s historically Black colleges
and universities and other minority-
serving institutions.
We will celebrate Veterans Day as a
nation on Monday, so this will be an
opportunity to stand as a Member of
the Armed Services Committee and as
a Senator from a very militarily con-
nected State to echo the words of Sen-
ator THUNE from a few minutes ago
that we owe a huge debt to our vet-
erans.
Also, November 10 is the 244th anni-
versary of the Marine Corps. As a fa-
ther of a U.S. marine, I also want to
specifically offer my congratulations
to the Corps.

ate and being on the Armed Services
Committee from a State that has the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6458 November 7, 2019
military tradition of Virginia is the
ability to meet wonderful leaders all
around my commonwealth, all around
the country, and all around the globe.
For those serving our country, we are
in their debt.
I do want to point out that we are
having a debate on the floor over the
Defense appropriations. The Senator
from South Dakota spoke a little bit
about that. I just want to lay out from
the Democratic perspective what is at
stake. It is not support of the military
that is at stake. As an Armed Services
Committee member, I am devoted to
making sure we get to the right appro-
priations level for the Department of
Defense.
What is holding this up is not one
party or the other not supporting the
military. What is holding this up is
that Democrats do not approve of the
practice that has been engaged in by
President Trump of rummaging
through the Defense Department’s
budget to come up with money for a
border wall, which our military leader-
ship says is a nonmilitary issue.
We do not believe that once Congress
appropriates money for a defense budg-
et, the President should be able to use
an emergency declaration to go into
the coffers of the Pentagon and can-
nibalize projects that affect our mili-
tary families to use for the border wall.
To the extent there is a dispute right
now, that is what the dispute is about.
It is not support for the Defense De-
partment or not; it is whether we
should allow a rummage sale in the
Pentagon budget to fund a border wall.
If you are going to have a discussion
about border wall funding, let’s do that
separately, but let’s not cannibalize
the Defense Department’s budget to do
it.
FUTURE ACT
Mr. President, I said that I want to
talk a little bit about our historically
Black colleges and universities and
other minority-serving institutions.
Many of my colleagues have been on
the floor this week talking about a bill
called the FUTURE Act, which is bi-
partisan. It passed from the House over
to the Senate, fostering undergraduate
talent by unlocking resources for edu-
cation. It also has bipartisan support
in the Senate. I am hoping that be-
cause it has bipartisan support, we
might be able to move forward with it
promptly.
Congress put in place a mandatory
funding stream in title III of the High-
er Education Act to invest in these in-
stitutions. Historically Black colleges
and universities—commonly called
HBCUs—Tribal colleges and univer-
sities, Hispanic-serving institutions,
and other minority-serving institu-
tions help boost educational oppor-
tunity for all students but especially
for students of color. These schools
serve a disproportionate number of stu-
dents from low-income families, and 75
percent of the students at HBCUs and
90 percent of the students at Tribal col-
leges and universities are Pell grant-el-
igible and receive Pell grants. Com-
bined, our minority-serving institu-
tions serve nearly 6 million students,
which is about one-quarter of all un-
dergraduate students in the country.
The $255 million in annual mandatory
funding of these institutions accounts
for nearly half of all Federal funding
for these institutions.
Unfortunately, the mandatory fund-
ing expired more than a month ago on
September 30 because of inaction by
the Senate—inaction by the Senate;
the House has acted—and that jeopard-
izes the future of these colleges, par-
ticularly the students they serve.
The FUTURE Act, which I cospon-
sored with Senator DOUG JONES and
Senator TIM SCOTT, extends this man-
datory funding for all minority-serving
institutions for 2 years. The bill is bi-
partisan. The bill has the support of
the White House. It is fully paid for,
and it is budget neutral. There are no
budget gimmicks involved. Yet we are
not able to take up the bill for a reason
I don’t understand.
Let me talk about HBCUs in Virginia
because we have five: Virginia Union
University, which is in my neighbor-
hood where I live in Richmond; Vir-
ginia State University in Ettrick,
south of Richmond; Hampton Univer-
sity in Hampton, VA; Norfolk State in
Norfolk; and Virginia University of
Lynchburg. These five institutions re-
ceived almost $50 million in this an-
nual mandated funding over the last 10
years.
Norfolk State University’s president,
Dr. Adams-Gaston, said that if the FU-
TURE Act is not passed, ‘‘Norfolk
State’s educational programs in both
teacher preparation and the STEM
fields will be put at risk at a time when
we are working to increase diversity in
the front of our classrooms, and grow
the pipeline of diverse STEM graduates
to fill the jobs of the new economy.’’
Virginia State University uses its
funding to keep student-faculty ratios
low, to provide distance education pro-
grams, to support curricular updates,
faculty training, and technology en-
hancement, especially for social work,
computer science, nursing, and edu-
cation degree programs. It also uses
the funds to prepare and support stu-
dents to attend graduate or profes-
sional schools and to award scholar-
ships to deserving students.
Virginia Union University is in my
neighborhood. Yesterday, Jaylynn
Hodges, who is a junior biology major
at Union, was in the Senate. She spoke
about the impact of title III funds and
its impact on her own education.
Jaylynn wants to pursue a career in
medicine, and fortunately Virginia
Union uses the funds on neuroscience
and chemistry laboratories, where
Jaylynn has been able to develop her
technical and analytical skills.
Virginia Union also uses funding for
technology resources, workforce devel-
opment programs in STEM and future
careers, academic support services,
such as academic counseling, updates
to historic buildings, and hiring fac-
ulty. Without passing the FUTURE
Act, all of these programs are in seri-
ous jeopardy.
The HBCUs serve as strong economic
drivers and generate significant eco-
nomic returns year after year in Vir-
ginia’s communities. I have also had
the good fortune to be on HBCU cam-
puses in Florida, and I know they have
the same impact within their commu-
nities and with students and in the en-
tire State as those in Virginia. The
UNCF—the United Negro College
Fund—found that, in Virginia alone,
the direct economic impact of our five
HBCUs is more than $913 million.
It is not just the impact on the Com-
monwealth that matters but the im-
pact these institutions have on indi-
vidual students. In one more quote, the
current student body president at Nor-
folk State University, Linei Woodson,
expressed:
Norfolk State University’s supportive and
culturally aware learning environment
helped me to grow as a leader and put me on
a path to success. I would likely not have
had these opportunities at other schools. All
students regardless of their socio-economic
background deserve access to quality higher
education and the opportunity to realize
their full potential.
In closing, the Thurgood Marshall
College Fund, which was named after
the titanic civil rights leader and Su-
preme Court Justice—on a personal
note, I was proud to have Thurgood
Marshall’s son John Marshall serve as
my secretary of public safety when I
was Governor—wrote a letter to Senate
leadership. It read that even in the
week since this program expired, which
was at the end of September, campuses
have already notified employees that
their positions and programs might be
terminated as of September 30, 2020, if
not sooner. In the letter, it is noted:
‘‘These are real jobs, held by people
who interact with students every day,
in programs that play a critical role in
graduating and retaining students in
the STEM fields, among other dis-
ciplines.’’
As a former Governor—and the Pre-
siding Officer and I share that experi-
ence—I know that the budget-creating
process begins well in advance of the
budget’s becoming effective. These mi-
nority-serving institutions, most of
which do not have significant endow-
ments, face unique fiscal challenges,
and they count on this mandatory
funding. Any uncertainty in the fund-
ing creates a significant planning chal-
lenge for them, and they run the risk
of creating a financial nightmare for
the students.
Today marks 51 days since the House
passed the FUTURE Act unani-
mously—these days, it is hard to act
unanimously on things in Congress,
but this bill passed the House unani-
mously—and 38 days since funding
lapsed for the schools in my State and
for minority-serving institutions
across the country. It is time for the
Senate to pass the bipartisan FUTURE
Act and pass it now. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in that endeavor.

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the
Senator from Connecticut, Mr.
BLUMENTHAL, and I have come to a
floor to offer a unanimous consent on a
bill called the Affordable Prescriptions
for Patients Act. We are in consulta-
tion with our colleagues on the other
side that have another bill that they
would also like to offer a unanimous
consent request for, and we are going
to talk and continue the conversation
during these two upcoming votes to see
if we can work out holds on their bill,
and we certainly would consider to do
that.
But Senator BLUMENTHAL and I do
expect to offer a unanimous consent on
our bill which would lower out-of-pock-
et costs for prescription drugs, which is
something I thought we were all for.
But working in good faith with our col-
leagues to try to work through these
two issues, we are going to give it a lit-
tle bit of time, as long as we can get
that done before we leave today.
I will just say there is no agreement
to pair these. If they could pass sequen-
tially, I have no objection to that, but
just to say that it would be nice, at a
time when we are so polarized here and
have put the ‘‘dys’’ back in ‘‘dysfunc-
tion’’ here in Washington, DC, that we
could actually show that we could
work together in a bipartisan basis and
pass a bill that passed unanimously in
the Judiciary Committee, of which my
friend from Illinois is a cosponsor.
I understand they want to use this
opportunity to get their bill passed.
Again, I have no objection to that and
do not intend to object, but there are
others who apparently have some con-
cerns that we need to check with.
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would
say that my friend and colleague, the
gentleman from Texas, has accurately
stated the situation, but let me add a
few sentences about the bill that we
are trying to couple with his effort. I
totally support what he and Senator
BLUMENTHAL are trying to do. The end
goal we all have in mind is to bring
under control or at least restrain the
increases in prescription drug prices.
The Senators from Texas and Con-
necticut have their approach. What
Senator GRASSLEY—a Republican from
Iowa—and I have suggested with this
approach is direct-to-consumer adver-
tising. The pharmaceutical industry
spends about $6 billion a year on ads on
television. If you have not seen a drug
ad on television, you clearly do not
own a TV.
We want to make sure that each one
of these ads contain, amid all the other
information they give you, one other
critical piece of information: the cost
of the drug.
We think that will be at least an in-
dication to the pharmaceutical indus-
try that we are watching how much
they are charging us. I think some peo-
ple will be shocked when they see the
actual cost of Humira and some other
drugs. But that is it, a complementary
approach. I hope we can do both. I
think the American people want to see
prescription drugs become more afford-
able.
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2755
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, it
is now several weeks since the Presi-
dent asked our troops to leave a crit-
ical sector in northern Syria, and, sub-
sequently, lots of things happened, in-
cluding at least 100 and probably more
ISIS prisoners escaping, an uncertainty
as to who is guarding the prisons where
ISIS prisoners are kept, and a whole
strategy as to how to continue the
fight against ISIS.
ISIS is not vanquished. ISIS is weak-
ened but not vanquished, and we all
know ISIS can come back. We all know
a small group thousands of miles away
can do untold damage in our homeland.
Yet we still have no plan, that we have
heard, from the administration on how
are we dealing with ISIS; how are we
dealing with the prisoners who escaped;
how are we dealing with the prisoners
who are still incarcerated; and how are
we dealing with ISIS overall.
This is one of the greatest security
threats America faces, and I would
hope we could pass this proposal, which
simply demands that the administra-
tion report to Congress on what their
plan is to deal with ISIS. It is that sim-
ple. That is the immediate danger.
I know my friend, the Senator from
Florida, wants to talk about what hap-
pened in the past. We can argue that
all day long, but the immediate danger
is ISIS, the ISIS prisoners who have es-
caped, the ISIS prisoners who are in-
carcerated, and the ISIS members who
still are around. We don’t have a strat-
egy, and it is one of the greatest
failings of foreign policy not only of
this administration but of any admin-
istration.
A resolution passed the House a
while ago. It has laid fallow here. All
we are asking in this legislation is very
simple: to require a report on the strat-
egy to secure the enduring defeat of
the Islamic State.
I hope we will not hear objection. I
don’t see how anyone could object
when the security of America is at risk
and when ISIS is still a danger. Every
one of us could come up with an
amendment to make it better. We
know we will not get it done if that
happens.
I hope we can move this forward, and
then we can debate other issues that
are not directly dispositive here be-
cause we have an immediate crisis, and
we need a report.
Madam President, I ask unanimous
consent, as in legislative session, that
the Senate proceed to the immediate
consideration of Calendar No. 281, S.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6460 November 7, 2019
2755, a bill to require a report on the
plan to secure the enduring defeat of
the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria;
that the bill be considered read a third
time and passed; and the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
objection?
The Senator from Florida.
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, reserving the right to object.
I thank the Democratic leader for his
concerns about the defeat of ISIS. If
there is one thing I hope we can all
agree on, it is that Turkey is not our
ally or friend right now. Turkey’s inva-
sion of Syria is benefiting ISIS, Iran,
and Russia, and hurting our great ally,
Israel.
The United States must stand up for
our partners, the Kurds, who helped us
fight ISIS. I am hopeful the ceasefire
will last, keeping American soldiers
and our partners, the Kurds, safe. No-
body wants our men and women in uni-
form involved in unnecessary, extended
military conflicts.
Bringing our troops home is a goal
we all share. In order to achieve that
goal, we need to have a fuller under-
standing of the crisis in Syria and what
got us there—with the hope our troops
can finally come home.
I also agree that the President should
always be clear with Congress on where
all U.S. troops are located and the pur-
pose of their deployment. Unfortu-
nately, my colleague’s proposal would
produce a report that only tells a small
part of the story.
In the name of transparency and a
fuller understanding of how we got
here, I am proposing a modification to
my colleague’s bill to require a report
that includes information on President
Obama’s plan for Syria.
We didn’t get here overnight. The
Democratic leader knows that. He said
himself it took us 5 years to get here.
So I think we all would like to see
what the strategy—or lack of strat-
egy—was from the last administration
that put us in this position today. Let’s
get all the facts on the table so law-
makers in Congress and Americans all
across the country can have all the in-
formation we need to keep Americans
and our allies safe.
Reserving the right to object, there-
fore, I ask that the Democratic leader
modify his request to include my
amendment, which is at the desk. I fur-
ther ask that the amendment be con-
sidered and agreed to; that the bill, as
amended, be considered read a third
time and passed; and that the motions
to reconsider be considered made and
laid upon the table.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the
Democratic leader so modify his re-
quest?
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President,
this is a diversion. We can all debate
history. Maybe Bush was to blame.
Maybe Obama was to blame. Who
knows. Maybe Harry Truman was to
blame when they set up CENTO. That
is something we can debate at a later
time.
We have an immediate crisis. We
need a report, and our Republican col-
leagues keep finding ways so they can
object so the President doesn’t have to
answer. That is wrong. It risks the se-
curity of America, and it is not what
we should be doing.
So I object, and I urge us to pass the
amendment without the modification,
which is still as valid as it was a few
minutes ago.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard on the modification.
Is there objection to the original re-
quest?
The Senator from Florida.
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, reserving the right to object. I
am disappointed in yet another polit-
ical stunt from the Democratic leader.
It is clear this is nothing but a polit-
ical attack on the President.
President Trump’s goal is to bring
American troops home and keep our
partners, the Kurds, safe and our ally,
Israel, secure. The Democratic leader
is requesting information from Presi-
dent Trump but refuses to join me in
asking for information about the se-
quence of events and the strategy
under President Obama that led us to
this point.
This is sad, but it is not surprising. It
is just another charade in a long list of
political games. Americans deserve a
safe Israel and a safe Syria, so I stand
today to object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Democratic leader.
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, if
they are worried about an attack, it is
not on this President or a previous
President. That is the political stunt
here, I would say to my friend in Flor-
ida. He knows what he is doing. He is
trying to stop this from happening.
The attack we are worried about is an
attack by ISIS on the United States.
Whether you are a Democrat, Repub-
lican, liberal, or conservative, the
country needs a plan. All of the diver-
sion, all of the games will not prevent
the American people from seeing that
we need that, and it is our job as Sen-
ators to push the administration to do
it.
So I would have hoped we could have
passed this amendment without the di-
versionary, partisan proposal made by
the Senator from Florida. I am sorry
we haven’t been able to move the
amendment. It is so wrong for the safe-
ty of this country.
I yield the floor.

November 7, 2019
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania.
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 1994
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I
rise this afternoon to offer a path for-
ward on the SECURE Act—the way
that I think we could actually do some
legislating around here and pass a con-
structive bill.
A little brief history, I think, is in
order and helpful for context. About 3
years ago, the Senate Finance Com-
mittee passed a reasonably similar leg-
islation out of committee unani-
mously. It was never considered on the
Senate floor. The House took up some
of these ideas and passed their own leg-
islation.
My own view is that most of the sub-
stance of this legislation is very con-
structive. Most of what it does is it
makes it easier for middle-class fami-
lies to save for their retirement. That
is constructive. However, the bill that
came over from the House is different
from the bill that came out of the Sen-
ate Finance Committee and was never
considered on the Senate floor. The
House bill dropped a number of provi-
sions that had bipartisan support. They
added some provisions that had never
been vetted by anybody on the Senate
side, at least not in a procedural way.
There is a proper way to resolve
these kinds of differences, and that is
to put this bill on the Senate floor,
open it up for amendments, and allow
the Senate to work its will. The Senate
will almost certainly pass some
version—probably very similar to the
House bill—and then we can iron out
whatever little differences there are.
This is the way we legislate. That is
what I am suggesting we do today. To
do otherwise would be to treat this
body as just a rubberstamp for the
House, and that is not the purpose of
having two legislative bodies.
I should also note that our Demo-
cratic colleagues have frequently criti-
cized Republican leadership and the
Republican majority for not legis-
lating. Sometimes they have a point.
The minority leader has said that the
Senate is a legislative graveyard. He
has criticized Leader MCCONNELL for
not putting bills on the floor and at
one point Senator SCHUMER said:
We want to debate these other issues. . . .
We are not saying our Republican friends are
going to think exactly as we do, but let’s
have a debate and vote.
I couldn’t agree more. I think we
should have a debate. I think we should
have a series of votes. I think we could
bang this out in a day, at the end of
which we would pass the SECURE Act,
preferably after considering amend-
ments from both sides. That is what I
am proposing. In fact, we have been
proposing this for weeks.
We have shared with our Democratic
colleagues several amendments that
the Republican Senators would like to
offer. One is mine. I have other col-
leagues who would like to offer them.
We have been asking our Democratic
colleagues for their list of amend-
ments. What things would they like to
do? What amendments would they like
to consider? We have restricted our
amendments to those which affect the
Tax Code. We have suggested that they
do likewise.
Amazingly, to me, we haven’t heard a
single suggestion yet from our Demo-
cratic colleagues. It is amazing because
I have heard plenty of criticism about
our Tax Code from our Democratic
friends, including criticism about the
limitation we put on State and local
tax deductions. I know there are Demo-
cratic colleagues who would like to ex-
tend the electric vehicle credit. There
are some who have proposed new taxes
on wealth. Chairman WYDEN has a pro-
posal to put a tax on unrealized mar-
ket-to-market gains on assets. There is
a long list of ideas we have heard from
the other side.
This is the opportunity to have some
votes and find out whether there is
support and to what extent there is
support for these things. On our side,
we are willing to vote. Every Repub-
lican Senator is in favor of this pro-
posal that I am going to suggest in a
few moments, whereby we would have
specific amendments on our side and
allow the Democrats to have an equal
number on their side. I don’t know
what could be more reasonable than
this approach.
Quickly, my amendment fixes a tech-
nical drafting error in our tax reform.
It is called the QIP. It is the acronym
that is used for it. It stands for ‘‘quali-
fied improvement property.’’
Here is the problem. Due to a draft-
ing error, businesses are now forced to
recognize the cost of improvements
over a long period of time rather than
to expense them in the years in which
the expenses occurred. It was a draft-
ing error. Everybody acknowledges it
was a drafting error and was unin-
tended.
Thirteen of my Democratic col-
leagues are cosponsors of my legisla-
tion to fix this, and every Republican
Senator supports fixing this error.
Those are 66 Senators right there. I am
not asking for a guaranteed outcome. I
am just asking for a vote. Let’s have a
vote on it. I have other colleagues who
would also like to have votes on their
amendments. As I said, our proposal is
that the Democrats pick an equal num-
ber of items that are important to
them, and let’s have votes on those. It
would look a lot like legislating. It
would be good to get back to legis-
lating. In a moment, I am going to
make a unanimous consent request to
do exactly that.
Before I do, I yield the floor to my
colleague from Texas, Senator CRUZ,
for his thoughts on this.
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I thank
the Senator from Pennsylvania for his
leadership on this issue.
I think Senator TOOMEY’s proposal is
an eminently reasonable, commonsense
proposal in that we take up the SE-
CURE Act with an equal number of
amendments from the Republicans and
the Democrats and that we vote on the
amendments on the Senate floor.
Now, everyone expects, in a few min-
utes, we are going to see the Demo-
crats stand up and object to that pro-
posal and say: No, we don’t want
amendments. We are not willing to
vote on amendments. We are going to
see the Democrats hold the SECURE
Act hostage because they are unwilling
to vote on amendments. We are going
to see the Democrats hold hostage bi-
partisan reform that would improve re-
tirement savings and also hold hostage
tax relief for Gold Star families that
should have passed a long time ago. It
is cynical for the Democrats to hold
this hostage, but because they are
afraid to vote, they are getting ready
to object and say that Gold Star fami-
lies don’t get their tax relief. The
Democrats are afraid to have a vote in
this body, and they are willing to hold
the Gold Star families hostage.
One of the proposals they are afraid
to vote on is that of commonsense edu-
cation reform that has bipartisan sup-
port. It concerns what are called 529
savings plans, which are immensely
popular tax advantage savings plans.
Over 18 million Americans use them
right now. The vast majority of those
who use 529 savings plans are middle-
class Americans. What 529 savings
plans allow is for parents and grand-
parents to save for the educational ex-
penses of their kids.
In 2017, as part of the tax reform, I
introduced an amendment to expand
529 savings plans not just to college but
to K–12 education. The Senate took up
that amendment, and it became the
only amendment the Senate adopted on
the floor of the Senate that added any-
thing to the tax cut. It passed this
body at about 1 o’clock in the morning,
by a 50–50 vote, with the Vice Presi-
dent’s having broken the tie.
It has become the most far-reaching
and significant Federal school choice
legislation that has ever been enacted,
benefiting up to 50 million school kids
across this country. That legislation is
already done, and it is actually not
what this fight is about. That fight was
about expanding 529s to K–12 edu-
cation. The American people won that
fight, and the Democratic opposition
lost that fight.
This amendment is, instead, a much
more modest amendment that takes
529 savings plans and expands them to
three groups of people.
No. 1, it allows the parents and
grandparents of kids with disabilities
to use 529s to save for educational
therapies for kids with disabilities and
to save for the additional assistance
those kids with disabilities need. That
is an eminently commonsense propo-
sition.
No. 2, it allows homeschooling fami-
lies to participate in 529 savings plans.
In 2017, the Democrats cruelly carved
out of 529s both kids with disabilities
and homeschooling families. There is
no reason kids with disabilities should

be discriminated against by the Demo-
crats in this body, and there is no rea-
son homeschooling families should be
discriminated against by the Demo-
crats in this body.
The third group of people it benefits
is that of public school students. What
this amendment says is that the par-
ents and grandparents who have kids in
public schools can use 529s to pay for
additional educational expenses. That
means they can use 529s to pay for
standardized test preparation. That
means they can use 529s to pay for tu-
toring costs or whatever additional
educational expenses they have above
and beyond their public schooling. This
would potentially benefit every child
in public school today.
We may see the Democrats suggest
that voting on this is somehow par-
tisan or divisive. The nice thing is that
we know as an absolute fact that it is
not. Why do we know that? My amend-
ment is for the expanding of 529s for
kids with disabilities, for
homeschoolers, and for public school
students.
My amendment was taken up in the
House Ways and Means Committee, and
it was adopted in the House Ways and
Means Committee—and this is impor-
tant—unanimously. That means every
single Republican on Ways and Means
voted for it and that every single Dem-
ocrat on Ways and Means voted for it.
The Democratic chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee voted for
this 529 reform. It was unanimous, bi-
partisan, commonsense reform. Unfor-
tunately, what happened after that is,
when the bill left Ways and Means and
went to the House floor, some political
leaders and teachers unions got upset,
and Speaker PELOSI essentially did a
drive-by shooting and, on the floor,
took the provision out.
Here is the part that is particularly
ironic. Do you know the single biggest
monetary beneficiary of the 529 reform
for which I am asking for a vote? The
single biggest monetary beneficiary
would be the public schoolteachers.
Why is that? It would allow public
school students and their parents to
have 529 savings accounts in order to
pay for tutoring. Who do you think
those parents are going to hire to tutor
their kids in public school? They are
going to hire other public school-
teachers. We are literally talking
about millions of dollars for public
schoolteachers that you are about to
see the Democrats block.
I would speak to the members of the
press corps. Just once, I would like to
see the press corps ask a Democrat:
Why are you blocking relief for chil-
dren with disabilities and their par-
ents? Why are you discriminating
against homeschooled kids, and why
are you hurting public schoolteachers
and stopping public school students
from being able to get tutoring and
test preparation?
It is worth noting that Senator
TOOMEY’s proposal is not even that this
proposal be adopted. It is simply that
we vote on it. Yet the cynicism of to-
day’s Democratic Party is such that we
are about to see them object to even
having a vote. That is unfortunate and
it is wrong.
I say let’s go back to the bipartisan
proposal for which every single Demo-
crat on the House Ways and Means
voted and every single Republican.
Let’s work together, and let’s actually
serve the people who elected us.
I yield to the Senator from Pennsyl-
vania.
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I
yield to the Senator from Ohio.
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I
thank my colleague.
I agree with him. As both my col-
leagues here know and as my friends
across the aisle know, I strongly sup-
port the underlying legislation.
I think the legislation is needed right
now. Unbelievably, if you are in a
small business, less than 50 percent of
the workers have access to retirement
plans. Two-thirds of Americans think
they will be in trouble in retirement
because they will not have enough
money to take care of their retire-
ments. Do you know what? They are
right to be worried, for we have a huge
problem in this country, and that is
what the underlying bill addresses. It
helps small businesses in their ability
to offer plans, which is where most of
the problem is in terms of there being
a lack of retirement savings and the
peace of mind in retirement that all of
our constituents want.
The problem is that the legislation
that came over from the House was
never considered here on the Senate
floor. In fact, if you go back to 2016,
when it was last considered, it was by
the Committee on Finance. So I think
it is reasonable to say, yes, this under-
lying bill is good, and I strongly sup-
port it, but let’s have a little debate
here on the floor. We shouldn’t be
afraid of that.
Let me make a point. I support what
my colleague from Pennsylvania
talked about in terms of the qualified
improvement property, and I support
what my colleague from Texas said in
terms of the 529 plans. Yet we are not
asking our colleagues on the other side
of the aisle to support these amend-
ments. I don’t have an amendment in
the mix, and we are not asking them to
support any of these amendments.
All we are asking is for them to allow
for a process by which we can have a
vote on their amendments, whatever
they are, that relate to retirement and
to tax policy—because this is a vehicle
through which we can talk about tax
policy—and to vote on our provisions
that my colleague from Pennsylvania
has laid out. Then let’s see what hap-
pens. That is how we are supposed to
operate around here. This is supposed
to be the world’s greatest deliberative
body, and sometimes we find ourselves
so tied up in knots that we can’t delib-
erate. We are just asking for delibera-
tion.
My hope is that this will work
today—that we will actually open up
this process and allow for a vote on the
SECURE Act, which is so important. It
came out of the House with a vote of
417 to 3. What an incredibly bipartisan
vote that was. Let’s have a little dis-
cussion on the floor about retirement
policy and about tax policy. Let’s vote
and let the chips fall where they may.
Then let’s actually send a bill to the
President that will help the people
whom we all represent.
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, in
reclaiming my time, as in legislative
session, I ask unanimous consent that
at a time to be determined by the ma-
jority leader, in consultation with the
Democratic leader, the Senate proceed
to the immediate consideration of H.R.
1994, the Setting Every Community Up
for Retirement Enhancement Act of
2019, the SECURE Act, which is at the
desk.
I further ask that there be a period of
general debate on the bill to be limited
to 10 hours, equally divided between
the two leaders or their designees, and
that following the use or yielding back
of that time, the only amendments in
order on the Republican side be the
amendments to be offered by Senators
TOOMEY, LEE, BURR, BRAUN, and CRUZ
or their designees, the texts of which
are at the desk, and five amendments
that propose changes to the Internal
Revenue Code to be determined by the
Democratic leader, with the concur-
rence of the chairman and ranking
member of the Committee on Finance.
I further ask that debate on each
amendment be limited to 30 minutes,
equally divided between proponents
and opponents, and that each amend-
ment, unless it would be considered
germane postcloture, be subject to an
affirmative 60-vote threshold and that
following the use or yielding back of
time on each amendment, the Senate
proceed to a vote on each amendment.
Finally, I ask that following the dis-
position of those specified amend-
ments, the bill, as amended, if amend-
ed, be read a third time and that the
Senate vote on the passage of the bill,
as amended, if amended, with no inter-
vening action or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs.
BLACKBURN). Is there objection?
The Senator from Washington.
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, in
reserving the right to object, earlier
this year, the House passed the SE-
CURE Act—a bipartisan package—in a
nearly unanimous vote of 417 to 3. This
bill has overwhelming bipartisan sup-
port, and it takes many good steps to-
ward improving retirement security for
families across our country. It would
help Gold Star families, small busi-
nesses, long-term and part-time work-
ers, and more.
With families in our country, nation-
wide, in the middle of a retirement cri-
sis, we should take the opportunity we
have right here in front of us today to
offer them some relief as soon as pos-
sible.
This bill, the SECURE Act, has wide
bipartisan support here in the Senate,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6463
November 7, 2019
and Democrats are ready to pass it
today as is. But now we have a few Re-
publican Senators who want to side-
track it with last-minute amendments,
including proposals that are not in the
interest of working families and will
kill any chance this bill has of becom-
ing law. For example, one of the
amendments strips out an important
provision the House made sure to in-
clude, while another one tries to jam
back in a proposal that the House took
out before it passed it so it could pass
by an overwhelming margin.
Well, let me be clear. Democrats
don’t think families relying on this re-
lief should have to wait while Repub-
licans try to chip away at it. We want
to pass this bill today as it is, which is
why I would like to ask the Senator
from Pennsylvania to modify his unan-
imous consent request; that the Senate
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of H.R. 1994, which is at the desk,
the SECURE Act, the bipartisan House
bill; and that the bill be considered
read a third time and passed and the
motion to reconsider be made and laid
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the
Senator from Pennsylvania so modify
his request?
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, I just will
say briefly that this is very dis-
appointing. What we are hearing from
our Democratic colleagues is that the
Senate is supposed to be a rubberstamp
for what the House has done. We are
not supposed to consider and deliberate
ourselves as a body. We are not sup-
posed to, apparently, entertain amend-
ments—equal numbers from both
sides—to attempt to reflect our con-
stituents’ interests and get to a legisla-
tive solution that would inevitably
have broad bipartisan support. I am
very disappointed.
Of course, I would reiterate, no Re-
publican has ever asked for a guaran-
teed outcome on any amendment. All
we are asking for is a vote, and appar-
ently that is asking too much, accord-
ing to our Democratic colleagues. I ob-
ject.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
Is there an objection to the original
request?
The Senator from Washington.
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, it
is very disappointing on this side that
there is an objection to this bill that
addresses so many important issues. It
has broad bipartisan support. Instead
of working to pass this bill in front of
us today, some Senators have focused
on tacking on amendments that don’t
help families and do not make this a
better bill; therefore, I object.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.
The Senator from Pennsylvania.
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask
unanimous consent to speak as in
morning business.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
objection, it is so ordered.
IMPEACHMENT
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise
today to discuss the impeachment in-
quiry currently underway in the House.
First, I want to recognize the coura-
geous public servants who have testi-
fied in the House in recent weeks in de-
fense of U.S. national security and in
defense of the rule of law and our
democratic institutions. I will cite just
four: Lieutenant Colonel Vindman,
Ambassador Yovanovitch, Ambassador
Taylor, and Ambassador McKinley.
Despite the two decades of military
service by Lieutenant Colonel Vindman
and the Purple Heart he earned for his
sacrifice for our country in Iraq, his
character has faced brutal attacks
from cable news and from some current
and former Members of Congress.
As former U.S. Ambassador to Russia
Michael McFaul put it in a Washington
Post column last week, ‘‘Such smear
tactics are revolting and un-American.
[Lt. Col.] Vindman has served our
country with honor and distinction,
both on and off the battlefield. . . .
And he is a patriot—as you would ex-
pect from someone with his out-
standing resume.’’
So said former Ambassador McFaul,
and I agree with him. I think most
Americans would agree with him.
Lieutenant Colonel Vindman is just
one of the many brave patriots who
have testified as part of this impeach-
ment inquiry.
Ambassador Yovanovitch has dedi-
cated over 30 years to U.S. foreign serv-
ice. She has rightfully earned the re-
spect and credibility that she has with-
in the U.S. national security commu-
nity for her anti-corruption efforts in
Ukraine and for her unwavering com-
mitment to U.S. national security in-
terests.
Ambassador McKinley has served
this country as Senior Advisor to the
Secretary of State and Ambassador to
Brazil, Afghanistan, Colombia, and
Peru. He has demonstrated fierce loy-
alty to his colleagues in the State De-
partment and to the United States
itself.
Ambassador Taylor’s life has been
marked by his service to our Nation,
from West Point to the 101st Airborne
in Vietnam, to his work as Ambassador
to Ukraine and other significant for-
eign policy roles.
We should all be inspired by these
and countless other public servants
who work to protect and serve the
United States every day. When I reflect
upon their service to our country and
their integrity, I am reminded of one of
the lines from ‘‘America the
Beautiful″: ‘‘Oh, beautiful for patriot
dream That sees beyond the years.’’
That is what these patriots are doing—
trying to understand and deliberate
about what their actions should be now
that will help America over time, to
see beyond the years. That is part of
the dream of a patriot, and these indi-
viduals have demonstrated that. They
have a care and a concern about our in-
stitutions, our government, our democ-
racy, our Constitution, and, of course,
a concern about what their actions
mean for the future.
Over the past week, the House com-
mittees leading the impeachment in-
quiry regarding President Trump’s, in
my judgment, abuse of power have pub-
licly released the first full transcripts
from several of their interviews with
State officials and diplomats. The
transcripts explain in rich detail how
the President employed Rudy Giuliani,
his personal attorney, to manage a
shadow diplomacy agenda focused on
personal vendettas and unfounded—and
that is an understatement—conspiracy
theories in Ukraine.
Ambassador Yovanovitch testified
that there was a ‘‘concerted campaign’’
to have her removed as Ambassador to
Ukraine and repeatedly discussed the
threatening and bullying behavior of
the President and Mr. Giuliani because
of her disagreements with Mr. Giuliani.
The Ambassador explained that a sen-
ior Ukrainian official expressed signifi-
cant concerns regarding Mr. Giuliani’s
behavior and told the Ambassador that
she ‘‘really needed to watch her back.’’
When asked whether she felt threat-
ened after President Trump told the
Ukrainian President that she was
‘‘going to go through some things,’’
Ambassador Yovanovitch responded
unequivocally ‘‘yes,’’ meaning yes, she
felt threatened.
And she indicated some of her friends
were ‘‘very concerned’’ about her per-
sonal safety.
Just imagine that. Imagine that. A
U.S. Ambassador concerned about what
would happen to her next. Even those
around her were concerned about her
personal safety because of what a
President was saying and doing—and
those around him.
Later in her testimony, Ambassador
Yovanovitch discussed the influence of
Rudy Giuliani in Ukraine. When asked
whether anyone at the State Depart-
ment tried to stop Giuliani’s efforts,
she explained as follows:
I don’t think so. I don’t think they felt
they could.
Now, let’s turn to Ambassador Tay-
lor. He described similar concerns
about Mr. Giuliani. Referencing the in-
vestigations President Trump wanted
Ukraine to pursue into his political op-
ponent—in this case, former Vice
President Joe Biden—Ambassador Tay-
lor described that the ‘‘irregular chan-
nel’’ of Ukraine policy directed by Mr.
Giuliani was focused on ‘‘one or two
specific cases, irrespective of whether
it helped solve the corruption problem’’
in Ukraine.
Ambassador Taylor further explained
that it was his ‘‘clear understanding’’
that ‘‘security assistance money’’ for
Ukraine would not be delivered until
President Zelensky ‘‘committed to pur-
sue the investigation.’’
Ambassador McKinley, a former sen-
ior adviser to Secretary of State
Pompeo, confirmed that he resigned
because of his concerns about the
President’s shadow diplomacy efforts

with Mr. Giuliani. When the chairman
asked Mr. MCKINLEY whether he re-
signed in part because of efforts to use
the State Department to dig up dirt on
a political opponent, Mr. MCKINLEY re-
sponded:
That is fair. And if I can underscore, in 37
years in the Foreign Service and different
parts of the globe and working on many con-
troversial issues, working 10 years back in
Washington, I had never seen that.
As the Washington Post reported on
September 21, the President’s behavior
related to this Ukraine matter has re-
vealed—in the opinion of this jour-
nalist at the Post, a reporter who has
covered the President very closely—No.
1, ‘‘a President convinced of his own in-
vincibility—apparently willing and
even eager to wield the vast powers of
the United States to taint a political
foe and confident that no one could
hold him back.’’
Let me move to the whistleblower
protections. Armed with this sense of
invincibility, the President has di-
rected some of his most pointed criti-
cisms at the brave whistleblower who
came forward to expose the President’s
call with the Ukrainian President.
On Twitter, the President has de-
manded to meet the whistleblower
face-to-face, despite laws that clearly
protect the whistleblower’s right to an-
onymity.
Just the other day, the whistle-
blower’s attorney confirmed that his
client offered to answer written ques-
tions under oath from House Repub-
licans as long as the questions did not
compromise the individual’s identity.
House Republicans immediately de-
nounced the offer, and the President
tweeted that ‘‘[w]ritten answers are
not acceptable,’’ despite the fact that
President Trump refused—refused to be
interviewed by Special Counsel
Mueller’s team and only answered writ-
ten questions during the special coun-
sel’s investigation into election inter-
ference.
Despite his own unwillingness to an-
swer live questioning, the President
has persisted in his desire to ‘‘out’’ the
whistleblower by tweeting that ‘‘we
must determine the Whistleblower’s
identity’’ and arguing that the press
would be ‘‘doing the public a service’’ if
it outed the whistleblower.
Nothing—nothing the President has
done or said in his more than 21⁄2 years
as President convinces me that he has
any understanding of public service or
doing the public a service, depending
on how you look at it.
President Trump has even demanded
to know who provided the information
to the whistleblower and suggested
that the source was ‘‘a spy’’ who would
have been executed ‘‘in the old days.’’
These comments follow the testi-
mony of Acting Director of National
Intelligence Joseph Maguire—a former
Navy SEAL with 36 years of military
experience and a Presidential Ap-
pointee—before the House of Rep-
resentatives in September.
Mr. Maguire said the following:
[W]e must protect those who demonstrate
courage to report alleged wrongdoing. . . .
The Inspector General is properly protecting
the complainant’s identity and will not per-
mit the complainant to be subject to any re-
taliation or adverse consequences for com-
municating the complaint to the Inspector
General.
Yesterday, in floor remarks, the jun-
ior Senator from Kentucky compared
the whistleblower to Edward Snowden
and argued that the current concerns
about the safety of the whistleblower
are nothing more than ‘‘selective out-
rage.’’
To be clear, Edward Snowden broke
the law. He abused his security clear-
ance and position of trust to leak clas-
sified information to the press. He
sought safe haven in Russia, and we are
unaware of any other information he
may have shared that could further
jeopardize national security.
The current whistleblower has strict-
ly followed the appropriate channels of
reporting, as confirmed by Director
Maguire, and the individual deserves
the full protection under the law.
The Senator from Kentucky ref-
erenced Edward Snowden in a con-
versation about blowing the whistle on
President Trump’s abuse of power. I
hope that anyone would not make a
comparison between the two cases.
Threatening a witness or retaliating
against a whistleblower is illegal. We
know that. The President’s public at-
tacks on the whistleblower only add to
the record of impeachable conduct.
His careless and extreme rhetoric not
only places the whistleblower’s per-
sonal safety in jeopardy, it undermines
the entire whistleblower program of
the intelligence community and across
the government.
The intelligence community and
Congress must continue to do all we
can to protect the current whistle-
blower’s identity and personal safety.
The current legal protections for whis-
tleblowers are insufficient to fully pro-
tect those who are courageous enough
to come forward and report wrong-
doing.
Of course, the reason we need the ad-
ditional protections is the President’s
conduct in threatening the whistle-
blower. No other President has ever
done this.
Congress must consider more ways to
protect whistleblowers, including crim-
inalizing the disclosure of the whistle-
blower’s identity. It should be clear
that should be a crime, if the statutes
do not provide for it now.
We must use this experience to en-
sure that whistleblowers will be pro-
tected from threatening rhetoric and
from actions by a President or any
other public official meant to intimi-
date whistleblowers. If you are threat-
ening a whistleblower, if you are trying
to ‘‘out’’ them, that is always—always
wrong. We do not have to worry about
whether a specific statutory provision
made it a crime. It is always wrong.
Until this President, that was well un-
derstood by people in both parties,
both Houses, and both branches.
This inquiry is not simply about
President Trump’s clear abuse of
power. This inquiry is about our de-
mocracy and the values our Founders
agreed should guide our Nation.
We owe the whistleblower, Lt. Col.
Vindman, Ambassadors Yovanovitch,
Taylor, and McKinley, as well as oth-
ers, our deepest gratitude and our ap-
preciation for their integrity and com-
mitment to American values. They are
real American heroes who, despite the
President’s bullying and harassment,
have stood up in defense of our demo-
cratic institutions and the values the
Founders fought to guide our Nation.

The Senator from Ohio.
BARKER HOUSE
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I
would like to take this opportunity to
talk about something positive that is
happening in Ohio with the help of the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
The Army Corps is involved with
some civic-minded community volun-
teers in something that will help pre-
serve our history in Ohio. It wouldn’t
be happening but for the vision of the
head of the Army Corps, Mr. R.D.
James, the Assistant Secretary of the
Army for Civil Works. It is a good-news
project regarding the preservation of
an important piece of the history of
the Northwest Territory and my home
State of Ohio. It is called the Barker
House. It is a historic home that dates
back almost 200 years. It was built by
the owner’s father, who was a Revolu-
tionary War officer and a famous early
settler and pioneer architect in Ohio. A
number of historic homes of his were
built along the Ohio River, and this is
one of them that is still left standing.
Colonel Joseph Barker, Sr., was his
name, and he is one of our most famous
early pioneers in Ohio.
The House was listed on the National
Register of Historic Places in 1979 for
its historic significance. In fact, Joseph
Barker, Sr., and the houses he built
play an important role in a new,
award-winning book by the great histo-
rian David McCullough, ‘‘The Pio-
neers,’’ and it tells the story of the
Northwest Territory and the founding
of Ohio in the wake of the Revolu-
tionary War. In ‘‘The Pioneers’’ book,
Colonel Barker’s stately homes were an
anomaly out on the frontier. His own
home was described as ‘‘a large, brick
house in the Federal style, with a
handsome front door, flanked by re-
cessed side windows and an elliptical
fanlight overhead. . . . [O]nce com-
pleted the whole house was painted
white, and soon became, as intended, a
‘distinguished seat of hospitality.’’’
This also describes the historic Bark-
er House we are trying to preserve.
These houses brought a level of ar-
chitectural refinement that stood in
sharp contrast to the log cabins on the
rugged landscape where these pioneers
were settling.
The Barker House is currently owned
by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
It is owned by them because it sits
right next to the Willow Island Locks
and Dam on the Ohio River. The house
was used as office space by the Corps
back in the 1960s, and today, the house
is still standing. It is vacant, in bad
shape, and unsafe to enter, but it is
savable.
I visited this historic Barker House
back in September of 2018. I learned
then that the Corps was proposing to
demolish the Barker House. They then
considered a proposal to move it brick
by brick to a new location off of Army
Corps’ land. Neither made sense.
That is when I met Jack Haessly,
who led a group—along with Wesley
Clarke, Bill Reynolds, Bob Ferguson,
and others—a local Barker House
friends group who said they would be
willing to raise the money to restore
this home on its historic site over-
looking the Ohio River. They wanted
to make sure it would be accessible to
visitors there and made into a mu-
seum.
I immediately called the Secretary,
Mr. R.D. James of the Army Corps, and

asked if he would reconsider the deci-
sion to demolish this historic home.
After hearing the story of the house
and the details of the group’s plan to
preserve it and after getting an assess-
ment from the Army Corps, Mr. James
agreed to reverse the Corps’ decision
and to work with us on preserving the
home. He deserves great credit for
that.
Congressman BILL JOHNSON, who rep-
resents the area, has also been an ex-
cellent partner in pursuing these sen-
sible solutions.
Right now, we are working on devel-
oping legislation that I hope to intro-
duce soon to convey the house and the
surrounding land to the friends group.
We have made a lot of progress so far.
Just last week, the Corps completed
drawings of the specific parcel pro-
posed to be conveyed, which also in-
cludes the creation of an access road so
that the house can be visited and en-
joyed by the public. We appreciate the
Ohio Department of Transportation
and Director Jack Marchbanks for
working with us on the road access.
The road access issue was critical, and
ODOT was very helpful. The Ohio State
Historic Preservation Office has also
jumped in and played a constructive
role.
This is an example of a true public-
private partnership, made possible by
Secretary James. I want to thank him,
the Army Corps, his team, the Barker
House friends group, the Ohio Historic
Preservation Office, and ODOT. All of
them are partnering with us to ensure
that this historic structure remains
standing so it can tell the story of our
rich history for generations to come.
S. 1431
Mr. President, I am on the Senate
floor today to talk about the oppor-
tunity we have here in Congress to
make substantial reforms to address an
issue that keeps a lot of Americans up
at night, and that is whether they are
going to have enough money in their
retirement.
I chair the Finance subcommittee
that handles retirement and pension
issues, and I have worked to pass bipar-
tisan legislation with then-Congress-
man BEN CARDIN, now-Senator BEN
CARDIN, over the years. That legisla-
tion has helped people save more in
their IRAs and 401(k)s and other retire-
ment plans, but we still have a long
way to go. In fact, according to a re-
cent study by Northwestern Mutual,
two-thirds of Americans believe they
will outlive their retirement savings.
People are right to be worried.
Right now, way too many workers
don’t have access to a retirement plan
at all, and too many Americans who do
have a plan are not saving enough.
Fewer than half of the employees at
businesses with fewer than 50 workers
have access to a plan, and only 34 per-
cent of them participate. That is where
the major problem is. These are work-
ers at mom-and-pop shops, small manu-
facturers, and countless other employ-
ers who make up the backbone of our
economy.
We can and should do more to make
sure these small business employees
are set up for retirement so that they
can find peace of mind in their retire-
ment. What is more, only 22 percent of
part-time workers today have access to
a plan—only 22 percent. More Ameri-
cans can have access to a retirement
plan just by our making some simple
changes in law.
A lot of Americans that do have a
plan haven’t saved enough, so they are
at risk of having their savings be inad-
equate for their increasing lifespans.
People are living longer, so this is a
bigger problem.
Social Security is absolutely essen-
tial. It is great that that safety net is
there. It is necessary to cushion the re-
tirement incomes for Americans. But
the average payout from Social Secu-
rity is 1,400 bucks a month. Try living
on that. It is tough. A lot of people
have a hard time with that, so they
need these extra retirement savings.
The lack of adequate retirement sav-
ings is made worse by the fact that we
have more and more baby boomers who
are retiring, so we have a bigger group
in this category. And people are living
longer. That is a good thing, but it cre-
ates an additional challenge with re-
gard to retirement savings.
For all these reasons, we need to
overhaul the laws governing the pri-
vate retirement system to help more
people get access to workplace savings
plans, encourage savings to help our
economy overall, and make sure people
don’t outlive their savings in their re-
tirement.
The good news is that we have that
package before us right now here in the
Senate. It would go a long way toward
making these changes. It is called the
SECURE Act, and it has already passed
the House of Representatives 51⁄2
months ago by an overwhelming bipar-
tisan vote of 417 to 3—that is right, 417
to 3. That never happens around here.
This is totally bipartisan. It is one of
these issues where we would have an
opportunity to pass it and then send it
directly to the President for his signa-
ture, and he has said he would sign it.
We are divided on so many issues in
Washington today, but this is one
where we have a rare chance for a truly
bipartisan solution to a problem that is
affecting people in every single State
represented in this body.
Today what was called a live UC was
tried. It was an attempt to get a vote
on the SECURE Act—this legislation I
am talking about—with five amend-
ments on each side. I support that, and
I supported my colleagues today who
came forward to offer that. The amend-
ments they outlined as our five Repub-
lican amendments all make sense to
me. Then the Democrats were told:
You should offer five amendments also.
You all pick them. Unfortunately, it
was objected to by the other side. That
didn’t surprise me because for the past
51⁄2 months, some of us have been try-
ing to get this legislation done, and
there are big concerns on both sides of
the aisle, but we are at a point now
where we know, having raised this live
UC, that we continue to have this
stalemate. After 51⁄2 months, I think it
is time for us to move forward on these
reforms.
Again, I like the amendments that
were proposed today. As an example, I
agree that allowing 529 plans to be used
for homeschooling expenses makes
sense. It is a reform Congress should
take up, but this underlying bill that
almost every Republican in the House
supported, even without this provision,
is one we also ought to take up. As dif-
ficult as it is for us to give up on
amendments on both sides, if that
can’t be done because it gets blocked,
then let’s go ahead and move the un-
derlying legislation, the SECURE Act.
It is a worthwhile piece of legisla-
tion. It helps in a category where we
need help badly; that is, small busi-
nesses. They have an easier time set-
ting up retirement plans under the SE-
CURE Act because the bill increases
tax credit for small businesses. In gen-
eral, you get $500 now for starting a re-
tirement plan. That would be raised to
$5,000. That is a tenfold increase.
Again, small businesses, where a major
gap in retirement plans are found, say
that would be a significant incentive
for them to set up a retirement plan.
Second, it provides an annual tax
credit to small businesses that intro-
duce automatic enrollment features
into their plan. Small business employ-
ees will have to opt out of saving for
retirement as opposed to opting in.
These autoenrollment features are fan-
tastic. The average participation in a
401(k) in a midsize business is about 75
percent of the employees. If it is
autoenrollment, where you automati-
cally enroll unless you opt out, it is
about 95 percent. This makes a lot of
sense to me. That is an innovative
change in this legislation.
Third, it streamlines a lot of the ex-
isting regulations associated with ad-
ministering a plan so small business
owners who already have a lot on their
plates can have an easier time focusing
on retirement for their employees rath-
er than bureaucracy and redtape.
Perhaps most important to me, the
bill allows small businesses to partici-
pate in what is called open MEPs—open
multiple employer defined contribution
plans. These are plans that allow busi-
nesses—some of these small businesses
we talked about earlier—even if they
are not in the same industry, they can
come together to work together to set
up a joint plan for their employees.
That becomes much more effective for
small businesses because they can
share the administrative costs and
share some of the liability expenses. It
has a lot of benefits for these small em-
ployers and will result in more people I
represent getting a retirement plan.
In all, the Joint Committee on Tax-
ation estimates this reform alone
would lead to 700,000 new retirement
accounts for small business workers
who need access.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6467
November 7, 2019
In my experience, that security real-
ly works. I grew up in a small family
business. My dad started his own busi-
ness. When he had five employees and
my mom was the bookkeeper, he said
they were going to set up a retirement
plan. It was called a profit-sharing plan
at the time. It was before a 401(k).
They had no profit the first few years,
so it was a little awkward, but when
they finally started making money, ev-
erybody had a stake. Everybody got a
little bit in their retirement nest eggs.
When 401(k)s came in, they imme-
diately started a 401(k) plan as well.
I meet people today whom I have
known my entire life who turned a
wrench their whole careers as a lift
truck technician—a lift truck me-
chanic—who have a retirement savings
plan now because of that. They have a
nice nest egg of about $500,000 to
$600,000 that they were able to accumu-
late. So I know this works. I know
small businesses have the opportunity
to do more for their workers if we help
them more here in Washington. I am
committed to trying to get this done.
Another important part of the SE-
CURE Act has to do with older Ameri-
cans. It says we should raise the age
limit that forces older American work-
ers to start depleting and paying taxes
on their retirement savings. Currently,
at 701⁄2 years old, you have to start tak-
ing money out of your retirement plan.
You have to do that whether you are
working or not. Many people at that
age are still working. My dad was still
working at 701⁄2. It drove him crazy
that he had to take money out while he
was still working. He wanted to keep
building it up. So in this legislation,
we say let’s expand that to age 72.
Then, as important, the bill actually
lifts the current prohibition on IRA
contributions by people over 701⁄2. That
means people can make the choice if
they want to keep investing in their re-
tirement for as long as they see fit. Re-
member, somebody who makes it to
701⁄2 is likely to live into his or her
nineties. So there is still a lot of time
in retirement where you need to have
that funding. That kind of flexibility is
how we allow people to manage their
own retirement savings that makes
sense.
The SECURE Act is good for small
businesses and good for older Ameri-
cans, but the reforms don’t end there.
It has a number of other good provi-
sions. In fact, one is particularly ur-
gent. It reforms the pension non-
discrimination laws I authored along-
side my friend Senator BEN CARDIN.
Our legislation is very simple. It says
we have a glitch right now in current
law. We introduced it as separate legis-
lation earlier this year, but it has now
been made part of the SECURE Act. It
is a critical piece of legislation to pass
because if it doesn’t pass—and pass
soon, like by the end of this year—
400,000-plus Americans are going to
have their benefits frozen in their de-
fined benefit plans. It will affect 400,000
people through no fault of their own.
In recent years, many companies
have transitioned from the traditional
defined benefit plans—think of that as
a pension plan—to a defined contribu-
tion plan like a 401(k). Some of them
have elected to grandfather existing
employees by closing down their tradi-
tional DB plans but allowing those who
are there to continue to have the bene-
fits. Unfortunately, what happened is,
as they build up seniority, one of the
rules in our current testing under
401(k) and profit-sharing plans and de-
fined benefit plans has come into ef-
fect. Inadvertently, it has resulted in
these plans not being able to continue
to approve benefits. It wasn’t meant to
work that way, but it has for a lot of
these people who are in these plans. As
a result, again, 400,000 autoworkers are
at risk of losing their benefits through
no fault of their own. Tens of thou-
sands of other workers have already
been affected by these flawed rules.
We have to fix this. We tried to pass
this by unanimous consent this fall.
This provision has no objection on the
Republican side or the Democratic
side. Yet we were not able to get it
done because some would like to make
it remain as part of the SECURE Act
and be sure the SECURE Act gets
passed. The way to do this is let’s pass
the whole thing. The SECURE Act
makes sense. This particular provision
is urgent. Let’s not wait. Do it now to
help those 400,000 Americans rep-
resenting States all over the United
States who are represented in this
Chamber.
Let’s pass the SECURE Act. It is a
bill that does a lot to put us on the
right path. Does it do everything? No.
Senator CARDIN and I introduced a
comprehensive bill called the Retire-
ment Security and Savings Act. We go
further in a lot of these regards than
we talked about today. That is a bill
that requires more hearings and a
markup and more consideration.
In the meantime, let’s do what we
can. Let’s provide more certainty,
more flexibility, and more retirement
savings. I am hopeful we can pass this
broader legislation I have with Senator
CARDIN soon. In the meantime, let’s
take advantage of the chance right
here in front of us. Let’s be sure we
boost the retirement security to the
American people through the SECURE
Act. I hope my colleagues will all join
me in this, and we can pass this legisla-
tion as the House did—on a strong bi-
partisan basis—and get it to the Presi-
dent for his signature.
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.

VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, one of my
top priorities has been to reauthorize
and modernize the Violence Against
Women Act. A survivor myself, I recog-
nize that VAWA provides the right re-
sources to tackle head-on domestic vio-
lence and sexual abuse in our commu-
nities in Iowa and throughout the
United States.
My good friend and colleague DIANNE
FEINSTEIN, ranking member on the Ju-
diciary Committee, agreed to work
with me on this important topic. For
months, Senator FEINSTEIN and I and
our staffs have worked closely and in
good faith with one another with this
shared goal in mind. We have met nu-
merous times, held discussions, and ne-
gotiated in a way that has produced
real progress.
But just this week, after months of
work and mountains of effort toward a
bipartisan bill, it all came to a screech-
ing halt. Once again, the Democrats
are putting politics ahead of people and
have decided to move forward on the
House-passed VAWA bill. The House
bill is a nonstarter and is chock-full of
partisan political talking points that
take us further away from rather than
closer to a bill we can get over the fin-
ish line.
I am all too aware of how this town
works. Election-year politics are in full
swing, and the grim reality is Demo-
crats cannot afford to be seen giving
Republicans a win. The far-left agenda
of the House has hijacked the process.
It sounds petty and it sounds unbeliev-
able, but, folks, that is the reality.
You would think that supporting sur-
vivors and preventing abuse would be
placed ahead of petty politics.
I want to be clear. I remain hopeful
that we can continue to work in a bi-
partisan way to get this law reauthor-
ized.
Soon, I plan to respond with a good-
faith proposal of my own. This bill will
support survivors and hold abusers ac-
countable. It is also a bill that I believe
can pass the Senate and get the Presi-
dent’s signature.
I invite my colleagues across the
aisle to join me in this very, very im-
portant effort.
I yield the floor.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan.
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise
today to discuss an issue that I hear
from families all across Michigan, the
rising cost of prescription drugs. Re-
cently, I held roundtables in several
communities across Michigan to hear
directly from families, local health
providers, and medical professionals
about the increasing cost of prescrip-
tion drugs. I want to share a few of
those stories.
I heard from Diane in Grand Rapids,
whose son, Jared, suffered a severe
asthma attack that tragically resulted
in his death. He was just 25 years old.
Diane said her son had insurance, but
it was not enough and he tried stretch-
ing out usage of his asthma medication
to deal with ever-rising costs. Diane
shared just how unimaginable her pain
was to lose her child to a condition

that should have been manageable,
with affordable life-sustaining medica-
tions.
I heard from Rachael from Greenville
who has three children with Type 1 dia-
betes, but insurance denied coverage
for her children’s insulin, making it
simply unaffordable. So Rachael’s fam-
ily drove across the border into Canada
where she said they were able to pur-
chase insulin for $71 per box, compared
to about $600 for the exact same insulin
in Michigan. Rachael is rightfully
angry that she needed to travel to an-
other country simply to get her chil-
dren the insulin they need to stay
alive.
Sheron from Detroit told me about
the financial challenges of treating
sarcoidosis, a rare disease, while also
fighting triple-negative breast cancer.
Sheron said that insurance was going
to charge her $5,000 for medication she
could easily take at home, but it would
completely cover it only if she went to
the hospital. The last thing Sheron
wanted to do was trek to the hospital
as she coped with the side effects of
chemotherapy.
And I heard from Jeanette from Bur-
ton, who had a nearly $500 co-pay for a
prescription while undergoing treat-
ment for thyroid cancer, but without
the help of a charitable patient group,
she could not afford the medication.
While working to get assistance, she
went without her medication and could
have suffered serious complications.
Unfortunately, these are not isolated
stories, and these are not isolated indi-
viduals. Too many Michiganders are
struggling with rising prescription
drug costs, and the consequences can
be literally life-threatening. Between
2012 and 2018, prices for brand-name
drugs in the United States have in-
creased 68 percent, making critical
medications out of reach for most fam-
ilies.
The list price in 2017 for a 1-year sup-
ply of Humira—the No. 1 selling brand-
name drug that treats arthritis, psori-
asis, and Crohn’s disease—was over
$58,000. That is more than the annual
median income for people in the State
of Michigan.
The price of insulin has spiked in re-
cent years, growing by 55 percent since
2014. That is simply outrageous, and it
is simply unacceptable. Guided by the
stories from Michigan families and
medical professionals, I am working to
examine and tackle the rising cost of
prescription drugs.
Earlier this week, through my work
as ranking member of the Senate
Homeland Security and Governmental
Affairs Committee, I announced I am
conducting an investigation into the
skyrocketing costs of prescription
drugs. I am also investigating the
growing shortages of critical medica-
tions affecting hospitals and patients
throughout the country.
Unaffordable prescription and hos-
pital-administered drugs—and the in-
creasing number and length of drug
shortages—have become an economic,
national security, and public health
crisis for Michigan, as well as for the
rest of the country.
Through my investigation, I am
working to: 1, identify solutions to ad-
dress increasing drug costs; 2, evaluate
the effect of drug shortages on patient
care; 3, examine the national security
implications of our growing reliance on
drugs manufactured overseas, pri-
marily in China and India.
This investigation builds on some of
my previous efforts, including my call
for the Food and Drug Administration
to share information on the Adminis-
tration’s efforts to counter drug short-
ages—and my bill advancing in the
Senate to lower healthcare costs for
seniors through Medicare Part B. For
many people in Michigan and across
the country, being able to afford your
medicine is a matter of life and death,
and we must take action.
We must allow certainly for safe drug
importation from Canada, but let me
be clear: Going to Canada is not a solu-
tion. You need to be able to purchase
affordable, quality, safe prescription
drugs in the United States.
We must improve competition, end
price gouging, increase price trans-
parency, and hold drug companies ac-
countable.
We must enable Medicare to nego-
tiate drug prices for seniors. We must
eliminate drug shortages to ensure
that all patients can get the medica-
tion they need when they need it, and
we must work to bring more affordable
generic medications to the market.
Families in Michigan and across the
country are counting on us. Families
should never be forced to choose be-
tween paying their bills or getting the
medication they need. But sadly, that
is the choice that too many families
are facing today.
I yield the floor.

ator from Alaska.
TRIBUTE TO PERRY GREEN
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is
Thursday afternoon, and that means it
is one of my favorite times in the U.S.
Senate because I get to come to the
Senate floor and recognize an Alaskan
who has done something that is great
for our State, great for the community,
great for the country—you name it. I
come here and brag about somebody I
represent in Alaska, and I call this per-
son the Alaskan of the Week. I know
the Presiding Officer likes it, and the
pages certainly do.
What I like to do when I am starting
this speech each week is talk to our
visitors in the Gallery and people who
are watching on TV to give a little up-
date on what is going on in Alaska and
encourage a visit. You will have the
visit of a lifetime, guaranteed, if you
come to Alaska.
Right now, as you can imagine, the
great white north winter is coming in
parts of the State. It has definitely ar-
rived in other parts. Winter is a great
time to be in Alaska, not just the sum-
mer. You can ski, snowboard, and at
the end of the day sit back, drink
something warm, and watch the north-
ern lights dance in our sky. So come
visit. You will love coming to visit
Alaska.
What is really nice to do if you come
and visit now is to wear a fur in Alas-
ka. We have some great furriers in
Alaska, but David Green Master Fur-
rier in Anchorage is one of the oldest,
most well respected, and certainly one
of the best in our State and, I think, in
the country. It is an Alaskan institu-
tion, and our Alaskan of the Week, Mr.
PERRY Green, one of the kindest, most
generous, most patriotic, hard-working
Alaskans, has worked throughout the
decades to keep this great institution
that way.
Let me tell you a little bit about
Perry Green. His father David was from
New York. He was enthralled with
Alaska, a huge fan of the characters
that Alaska attracts, as well as Jack
London’s ‘‘Call of the Wild.’’ So David
moved to Washington State to be close
to Alaska, where he eventually opened
stores many, many years ago.
Perry Green, David’s son, was born in
Seattle on March 17, 1936. That is St.
Patrick’s Day. How great is that? I al-
ways knew Perry had a little Irish in
him. He recalled:
My father would come back from Alaska
with such great stories, and all the Alaska
sourdoughs would come to visit him. They
sat at the dinner table and I was enthralled
with their tales.
Anyone who knows anything about
Alaska knows those stories, has heard
about them, read about them—bear at-
tacks, moose charges, frostbite, cross-
ing perilous rivers, traversing vast
landscapes under the dancing skies,
wolves howling in the distance, fires
barely starting at 40 below, and count-
less stories about being saved by the
kindness of strangers out on the trail.
Perry also came of age during World
War II. His father made fur ruffs for
the soldiers’ parkas, which set the
stage for Perry’s enduring patriotism
and support for our troops. He said:
I remember watching the troops head over-
seas, the wonderful parades. It all made me
swell up with pride.
I would say that Perry Green is the
most patriotic American I know, and
we have a lot of patriots in Alaska.
He met his beautiful future wife, the
beautiful Gloria, gracious Gloria, when
they were both young and began dating
as teenagers, and they have been to-
gether ever since. As a matter of fact,
that is 63 years of marriage. That is
something to be celebrated. Perry said
that marrying Gloria was the best deci-
sion he ever made. I know Gloria, and
I would certainly agree with Perry, and
I would certainly agree with this: Like
me, he definitely married up.
Like his father, he traveled back and
forth to Washington State often for
work. He went to Alaska to work on
the Alaska Railroad in order to save
enough money to buy Gloria a wedding
ring. He served in the U.S. Army for 3
years, and eventually he and Gloria

made their way to our great State to
forge a life together. They have been
there ever since, and what a life they
have lived.
Initially, Perry worked at his fa-
ther’s store in downtown Anchorage,
but for a time he broke out on his own
and started the Anchorage Fur Trading
Company, which became the largest fur
dealer in Alaska, and it was wildly suc-
cessful. He traveled all across the
State—300 villages in all, some of them
multiple times—buying furs from the
locals. He traveled by dog team, by
sled, by snow machine, by bush plane,
and everywhere he went he was greeted
warmly and generously by people in
rural Alaska in these villages. He said:
I learned so much from the Alaska Native
people. I was in awe of their kindness, their
respect for elders, and their rich, cultural
heritage.
That time in rural Alaska was one of
the best times of his life and laid the
foundation for what has been one of
Perry Green’s biggest loves—our State,
the great State of Alaska, which he has
given his all to.
His company, David Green Master
Furrier, is an iconic business in down-
town Anchorage because they sell some
of the best and most beautiful furs
around, no doubt, but also because of
Perry and his extended family, who
have done such a great job of running
the company for decades.
My daughters and I have a little tra-
dition on Christmas Eve. We head over
to this great store and look for some-
thing to buy my wife, their mom. It is
a fun, fun tradition that we do.
Perry has been the face of the store
for decades. People still remember his
quirky commercials featuring taran-
tulas, huge athletes chasing him
around, and always the tagline, ‘‘If you
don’t know your furs, know your fur-
rier.’’
It seems that all of Anchorage and so
much of Alaska knew their furrier. It
should be noted that they also know
this Alaska furrier in Las Vegas as
well. Perry Green is a very good poker
player and has won three World Series
of Poker bracelets and has made it to
the final table of the World Series of
Poker main event in Vegas two times.
How about that for an adventurous
life?
It wasn’t just his store and Perry’s
love of a good poker game that has en-
deared him to so many Alaskans. A
man of deep faith, he is one of the most
generous people in my State and one of
the most committed Alaskans to public
service and helping others.
‘‘I never was interested in being
rich,’’ Perry said. ‘‘I wanted to do
something positive for other people be-
cause that’s the greatest thing you can
do.’’
He has sat on nearly every board
there is. You name it—the taxicab
commission, the insurance board, the
planning and zoning board, the sym-
phony and opera board, the Rotary
board, and a member of the Elks Club,
the Masons, the Alaska Jewish Campus
and Museum. The list goes on and on in
terms of his service.
He also raises money for numerous
causes. ‘‘I can’t think of a fundraising
effort that his name isn’t a part of,’’
his longtime friend Gordon Glaser said
about Perry.
Perry is especially generous in causes
that raise money for our men and
women in uniform. On the eve of Vet-
erans Day, we can’t thank him enough
for that.
‘‘Anyone who’s been in Anchorage in
the last two generations knows that if
you need something done, Perry will do
it,’’ his friend Gordon said.
If you are down on your luck or if
you need a job, need a place to stay, or
need some assistance, Perry will help.
Every community, every State, has
leaders like this. We all know those
types of people. They are very special,
and he is one of them.
Perry and his wife Gloria are also
personally generous with their house—
a lively, happy place open to people all
across our State and, really, the world.
Anchorage Mayor Ethan Berkowitz,
another longtime friend of Perry’s,
credits him for teaching him and so
many others ‘‘how to be an Alaskan.’’
What does that mean? According to
Mayor Berkowitz, it means that he
brought the spirit of Tikkun Olam to
Alaska. That is a Hebrew phrase mean-
ing healing the world. Perry has
brought this to our State one generous
act at a time, one community at a
time.
Perry and Gloria will be honored at
Alaska’s Jewish Gala next week—one
of our State’s most fun and memorable
events. It will be next Saturday
evening, and I will be there for sure. It
is a time when we all can gather to-
gether, celebrate the vital role the
Jewish community has played in our
great State, and be reminded that
Alaska is a place where we can all
come together and take care of each
other the way the Greens have been
doing for decades.
Rabbi Yosef Greenberg, a good friend
of mine and another extremely gen-
erous man who has given so much to
our State, says that the mission of the
Alaska Jewish Campus that Perry
Green has been so generous to is
‘‘Warming up Alaska!’’
‘‘In the 60 years of Alaska’s state-
hood,’’ said Rabbi Greenberg, ‘‘Perry
Green has warmed up Alaska, not only
with his David Green fur coats but
even more so with the joys of his life,
big heart, and lending a hand to ordi-
nary Alaskans and anyone in need.’’
That is how he has warmed up our
great State.
Perry and Gloria have done so much
for Alaska. They are highly deserving
of this recognition they will be receiv-
ing at the Jewish Gala next week. Con-
gratulations to them and their 5 chil-
dren, 13 grandchildren, 8 great-grand-
children, and all of the extended Green
family, so many of whom continue to
serve our State and country so well.
Perry, from your friend, congratula-
tions on being our Alaskan of the
Week.

REMEMBERING KAY HAGAN
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is
great sadness that Marcelle and I
learned of the passing of Senator Kay
Hagan of North Carolina on October 28.
I have served in the U.S. Senate with
nearly 400 Senators. Like many of
them, Senator Hagan fought day and
day out for her constituents in North
Carolina and for the ideals and morals
on which our country was founded.
Senator Hagan followed a line of pub-
lic service in the Hagan family. Her fa-
ther and brother served in the Navy,
and her uncle, Lawton Chiles, rep-
resented Florida here in the U.S. Sen-
ate. Recognizing the sacrifice and im-
portance of our Nation’s service mem-
bers, Senator Hagan was a tireless ad-
vocate for our military members and
their families. During her time in the
Senate, she was an active partner in
our efforts to strengthen the National
Guard, and she authored such impor-
tant legislative initiatives as the Hire
a Hero Act. She was also a tireless ad-
vocate for women and children, for ef-
forts to support victims of crime, and
for the advancement of civil rights. Her
tenure in the Senate, in my view, was
too short.
After Senator Hagan’s work in the
Senate, she went on to become a senior
policy consultant for Akin Gump,
where she held a particular focus on
the health and financial services sec-
tors. Additionally, in 2015, Senator
Hagan became a resident fellow at the
Institute of Politics at Harvard Univer-
sity, where she studied the influence
money has in our politics. She said, ‘‘I
worry how we are going to get good
people to run for office if you have to
spend so much time raising money.’’ I
agree. Our public servants at every
level of our govemment should be more
focused on advocating for their con-
stituents, rather than raising a war
chest to fight against wealthy cor-
porate interests, pressure groups, or
dark money influencers.
Her tragic affliction with Powassan
virus, which ultimately led to her pass-
ing last month, robbed us of Senator
Hagan’s dedication to public service far
too soon. It was also a stark reminder
of how precious our time really is.
I know Marcelle and I join with
North Carolinians and our Senate fam-
ily in mourning the passing of Senator
Hagan. Our hearts go out to Chip, their

f
REMEMBERING JOHN CONYERS
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise
today to remember John James Con-
yers, Jr., of Detroit, MI, the longest
serving Black Congressman in history
and a champion for civil rights and so-
cial justice. Sadly, Mr. Conyers passed
away last week at the age of 90. Mr.
Conyers was passionate about serving
his country and his constituents, al-
ways fighting for those without a
voice.
Mr. Conyers was born in Detroit, MI
on May 16, 1929, to John and Lucille
Conyers. After graduating from North-
western High School, Mr. Conyers
worked as a welder for Lincoln auto-
motive while attending Wayne State
University. He served in the Michigan
National Guard before enlisting in the
U.S. Army during the Korean war,
where he served as a second lieutenant.
After 4 years of service, he was honor-
ably discharged and returned to Wayne
State University to obtain his bach-
elor’s degree in 1957 and his law degree
in 1958.
In 1958, Mr. Conyers continued his
life of service as a legal aide to Rep-
resentative John Dingell, Jr., of De-
troit. He then ran for Congress in 1964
and for the next 53 years, represented
metro Detroit in a career full of many
historic firsts for civil rights and the
Black community.
Mr. Conyers was on the frontlines of
the civil rights movement. He was a co-
sponsor of the Voting Rights Act of
1965 and worked with Martin Luther
King, Jr., in Selma, AL to advocate for
equal rights. In 1967, during the civil
unrest in Detroit, Mr. Conyers was in
the streets, encouraging peace and an
end to the rioting. After the tragic as-
sassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.,
in 1968, Mr. Conyers introduced legisla-
tion to forever remember Dr. King’s
legacy with a Federal holiday. He re-
introduced his bill every session until
it was signed into law in 1983. He also
hired civil rights legend Rosa Parks to
work in his Detroit office, where she
stayed for over 20 years.
In Congress, Mr. Conyers was a
founding member of the Congressional
Black Caucus. He also served on and
was chairman of the House Oversight
Committee and the House Judiciary
Committee. By the end of his service,
he was the longest serving African-
American Congressman in history, as
well as the dean of the House of Rep-
resentatives.
As an activist, trailblazer, and lead-
er, Mr. Conyers will be greatly missed
across Michigan, as he touched the
lives of many people throughout Michi-
gan. Mr. Conyers is survived by his
wife of 29 years, Monica, and his two
sons, John and Carl.
Mr. President, I cannot express
enough the impact Mr. John Conyers,
Jr., had on the city of Detroit and the
State of Michigan. He was a pillar of
our community and a model of humble
leadership. His passion and tenacity
will be missed. However, I am confident
his legacy will continue to inspire oth-
ers to serve and fight for justice and
equality for all.
f
VETERANS DAY
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I honor
the service and sacrifices of our vet-
erans and their families every day. As
we approach the 101st Veterans Day on
Monday, I want to take a moment to
pay special tribute to the men and
women who have worn a uniform in de-
fense of our great Nation, its people,
and our values.
Progress usually is a good thing, but
sometimes it comes with frightful con-
sequences. The industrial revolution
brought the development of weapons
and tactics that enabled humankind to
wage war and carnage upon itself at a
level never before seen. By the end of
World War I, there were approximately
40 million military and civilian casual-
ties. H.G. Wells predicted it would be
‘‘the war to end war.’’ Tragically, that
was not the case.
The United States played an instru-
mental role in ending World War I,
then known as the Great War. On the
11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th
month in 1918, Germany signed an ar-
mistice with the Allies in a railroad
car outside Compiegne, France. One
hundred years ago, on November 11,
1919—exactly 1 year after the signing of
the armistice with Germany—Presi-
dent Woodrow Wilson proclaimed the
first ‘‘Armistice Day’’ to commemorate
the day. On that occasion, he stated:
‘‘To us in America, the reflections of
Armistice Day will be filled with sol-
emn pride in the heroism of those who
died in the country’s service and with
gratitude for the victory.’’
Maryland played a critical role in
ending that conflict with victory.
Prominent military installations such
as Fort Meade and Aberdeen Proving
Grounds rapidly trained and deployed
troops to Europe, and about 2,000 Mary-
land servicemembers made the ulti-
mate sacrifice in defense of our free-
dom and ideals.
Congress passed legislation to estab-
lish Armistice Day as a legal holiday in
1938, ‘‘dedicated to the cause of world
peace.’’
The advent of World War II brought
new challenges to America. Just as be-
fore, countless brave men and women
stepped forward to do their part in
service of their country. And just as
before, Marylanders stepped forward
arm-in-arm with their fellow citizens.
The mighty Bethlehem-Fairfield Ship-
yard in Baltimore produced hundreds
of ships at dizzying speed to fight a war
across a great ocean. Just a few miles
from there, Glenn L. Martin Company’s
Aircraft produced A–22 Maryland
bombers among other critically impor-
tant aircraft in the battle for air supe-
riority.
Marylanders heroically fought on
battlefields across the European and
Pacific theatres. In all, 6,454 Maryland-
ers lost their lives in World War II.
Their names are memorialized in the
granite of the Maryland World War II
Monument in Annapolis.
In 1954, after the Korean war, vet-
erans service organizations urged Con-
gress to amend the 1931 act by striking
out the word ‘‘Armistice’’ and insert-
ing the word ‘‘Veterans.’’ With the ap-
proval of this legislation on June 1,
1954, November 11 became a day to
thank and honor all American veterans
who have served in wartime and peace-
time.
Successive conflicts and a rapidly
modernizing world have brought their
own unique national security chal-
lenges, but Americans’ bravery and
willingness to serve has never wavered.
Our Nation’s security has always de-
pended on the men and women of our
military, and for their service, we are
eternally indebted.
Maryland continues to play a stra-
tegic role in our Nation’s security in-
frastructure. The Old Line State is
home to 11 military installations.
Among the facilities are Joint Base
Andrews, which is home to the Presi-
dent’s two Boeing VC–25 airplanes,
which have the call sign ‘‘Air Force
One’’ while the Commander-in-Chief is
on board, and the United States Naval
Academy in Annapolis, which has been
training midshipmen since 1845.
We honor all those men and women
who have endeavored to protect our
country and preserve our democracy so
that Americans may live free from tyr-
anny. Maryland is fortunate to be
home to about 371,000 military vet-
erans. These servant-leaders live
amongst us as schoolteachers, small
business owners, homemakers, public
servants and most every other profes-
sion and they continue to give back to
our communities.
Let us all honor our veterans on this
solemn day and every day by holding
the values they fought so gallantly to
defend and by providing them with the
benefits they earned through blood,
sweat, courage, and perseverance.
On this Veterans Day, I join all
Americans in thanking our veterans
for their service, their sacrifice, and
for being role models for future genera-
tions of Americans who will pick up
the mantle of defending our great
country.
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, on this
Veterans Day 2019, I wish to pay trib-
ute to all veterans and thank them for
their service. The freedoms we enjoy in
America today are because of them.
For more than 200 years, our veterans
have fought across the globe defending
our freedoms, while their families
waited and worried at home. Thanks to
them, the forces of tyranny and oppres-
sion have been turned back and de-
feated time and again.
As Americans across the Nation
come together on Veterans Day, I will
be participating in a program in Fargo,

one of many being held in communities
across North Dakota. Next Wednesday
in Williston, several military organiza-
tions and Williston State College will
sponsor a presentation by Medal of
Honor recipient SSG Clinton Romesha.
As one of only 3,507 recipients in
American history to receive this honor,
Staff Sergeant Romesha was the fourth
living Medal of Honor recipient for the
Afghanistan and Iraq wars. It was pre-
sented in 2013 for his heroism during
the Battle of Kamdesh in October 2009,
a 12–hour battle that was significant in
the Global War on Terrorism.
During this intense attack by some
300 Taliban fighters, despite his own
shrapnel wounds, Romesha continued
to fight. His actions helped mount a
successful counterattack that elimi-
nated Taliban machine guns and al-
lowed for wounded soldiers to be taken
to an aid station.
In his bestselling memoir, ‘‘Red Pla-
toon: A True Story of American
Valor,’’ published in 2013, Romesha
shares the account of the Battle of
Kamdesh and how one person can make
a difference against seemingly impos-
sible odds.
Now a resident of Minot, ND, he trav-
els extensively as a motivational
speaker, sharing the message about
how the capacity for leadership and
bravery resides within everyone.
I commend Williston State College
and its Foundation, the Williston Basin
Chapter of the American Petroleum In-
stitute, Williston Post 37 of the Amer-
ican Legion, Military Affairs Com-
mittee, VFW–Post 12169, and Williston
Chapter 9 of the Disabled American
Veterans for bringing this inspirational
message by a true hero to their com-
munity.
Mr. President, on this Veterans Day,
may we be reminded to be thankful
every day for all who serve our coun-
try. May God bless all veterans and
their families. They are all heroes.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS
TRIBUTE TO TODD PORTUNE
∑ Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise
today to honor Mr. Todd Portune, a
dedicated public servant, who has spent
his career serving the people of Cin-
cinnati with dedication and enthu-
siasm. Commissioner Portune is retir-
ing from politics following this term
after more than a quarter century of
service, and I know how much he will
be missed by the people of Southwest
Ohio.
Commissioner Portune was born in
Cincinnati and from an early age was
known for his work ethic. Throughout
his education, Commissioner Portune
remained in Ohio, graduating from
Colerain High School, Oberlin College,
and serving as the president of the Stu-
dent Bar Association at the University
of Cincinnati Law School.
Commissioner Portune’s leadership
embodies good government in action.
He helped lead the way in improving
public health, from working to reduce
infant mortality to expanding oral and
dental care. Through projects to in-
crease housing and job opportunities
and secure funding for local first re-
sponders, he consistently focused on
what he believed to be the fundamental
goal of public service: to improve peo-
ple’s lives.
His service, from four terms in Cin-
cinnati City Council to six terms as
Hamilton County commissioner, in-
spired many to stand up for what they
believe in. Commissioner Portune’s
fight for human rights will be a lasting
part of his legacy. He advocated for
LGBTQ rights before it was popular,
and he always supported disability in-
clusion, those battling with addiction,
and people without a voice in govern-
ment.
His political triumphs can only be
matched this his incredible personal
tenacity throughout every obstacle
thrown his way. But no matter what,
he focused on serving the people in his
beloved county.
Commissioner Portune will be re-
membered for his good humor, passion
for public service, and strength to en-
dure battles of all kinds. I ask my Sen-
ate colleagues to join me in thanking
him for his service to our community
and our State.∑

TRIBUTE TO DR. W. MARK
DONALD
∑ Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, I
am pleased to commend Dr. W. Mark
Donald, who has been elected as speak-
er of the House of Delegates for the
American Dental Association, where he
will serve a 3-year term. Dr. Donald
has long been a leader in the dental
community in Mississippi, and I look
forward to seeing his success in this po-
sition with the American Dental Asso-
ciation, ADA.
A native of Louisville, MS, Dr. Don-
ald graduated from the University of
Mississippi School of Dentistry in 1988.
Following graduation, he completed
his general practice residency program
with the VA Medic Center and the Uni-
versity of Mississippi School of Den-
tistry in Jackson, MS. In 1990, Dr. Don-
ald opened his general dentistry prac-
tice in Louisville, MS. For three dec-
ades, Dr. Donald has been very active
in the dental community in Mis-
sissippi. He has served as speaker,
president, and as an ADA delegate for
the Mississippi Dental Association. In
addition, he served as speaker and
president of the Academy of General
Dentistry and as president of the Acad-
emy of General Dentistry Foundation.
His other experience includes serving
as a member of the ADA Council on
Dental Practice in 2018; as chair, vice
chair, secretary/treasurer, and parlia-
mentarian of the ADA 5th District; and
as Mississippi Mission of Mercy Project
chair in 2011, 2013, and 2019. Since 2015,
Dr. Donald has taught the next genera-
tion of Mississippi dentists as an ad-
junct faculty member at the University
of Mississippi School of Dentistry. In
2017, Governor Phil Bryant appointed
Dr. Donald to serve on the Mississippi
Board of Dental Examiners, where he
still currently serves.
Dr. Donald’s contributions, dedicated
service, and commitment to excellence
have made a difference for dentists and
dental patients across my State. In his
new role serving as speaker of the
House of Delegates for the American
Dental Association, I believe he will
continue to commit himself to
bettering the dental profession and im-
proving the lives of patients across the
nation.
Mr. President, Mississippi is ex-
tremely proud to have Dr. Mark Don-
ald serving as speaker of the House of
Delegates for the American Dental As-
sociation. He has my appreciation and
gratitude for all he has done for the
great state of Mississippi. I wish Dr.
Donald, and his family, all the best in
their future endeavors.∑

RECOGNIZING EAGLE ROCK
GALLERY
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a mem-
ber and former chairman of the Senate
Committee on Small Business and En-
trepreneurship, each month I recognize
and celebrate the American entrepre-
neurial spirit by highlighting the suc-
cess of a small business in my home
State of Idaho. However, in honor of
Veterans Day on November 11, this
month I will honor a veteran-owned
small business for each of the 10 days
the Senate is in legislative session. The
personal sacrifices made by America’s
veterans have protected the very free-
doms and values that give each of us
and our children the ability to achieve
the American dream. The skills vet-
erans learn as members of the military
are invaluable and undoubtedly con-
tribute to Idaho’s flourishing veteran
business community. I am proud of the
sacrifices veterans have made to pro-
tect our country and that they are
choosing Idaho to call home when they
complete their service in the military.
As your U.S. Senator from the great
State of Idaho, it is my pleasure to rec-
ognize Eagle Rock Gallery in Idaho
Falls as the Veteran-owned Idaho
Small Business of the Day for Novem-
ber 7, 2019.
Eagle Rock Gallery opened 6 months
ago in Idaho Falls. It is owned and op-
erated by U.S. Army veterans Gary
Jensen and his wife, Kathi Cheyenne
Jensen. The Jensens opened the gallery
to host a collection of nationally and
internationally recognized fine artists.
The gallery includes a portrait studio,
where clients can schedule portrait ses-
sions for their families, friends, and
even pets. In addition, the gallery fea-
tures a variety of art available for pur-
chase.
Kathi Cheyenne Jensen is an award-
winning photographer known for her
patriotic images, specifically those
that feature bald eagles. The Jensens

TRIBUTE TO COLONEL JAMES
LONG
∑ Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I
congratulate a former staff member of
mine, James Long, on his recent pro-
motion to colonel in the Air Force Re-
serve.
Jim served for a year as an Air Force
fellow on my staff back in 2011. He
worked hard and did a great job for us
as we worked to make sure the men
and women of the military were prop-
erly funded, organized, trained, and
equipped. In particular, Jim was very
helpful with respect to intelligence
community issues, having previously
served as a senior special agent at the
Central Intelligence Agency’s Office of
the Inspector General, where he con-
ducted and oversaw investigations of
CIA officers and contractor personnel.
After leaving my office, he went on to
work with the Air Force’s Office of
Special Investigations as the chief of
the Crime Integration Desk, as well as
being individual mobilization
augmentee to the Commander of the
Investigations Collections Operations
Nexus Center at Marine Corps Base
Quantico.
Last year, while continuing his work
in the Air Force Reserve, Jim was
hired by the Department of Homeland
Security’s Office of Inspector General
to build its first Major Frauds and Cor-
ruption Unit. He currently oversees
large-scale criminal investigations and
has put together a team of anti-fraud
professionals, including special agents,
forensic auditors, forensic accountants,
data scientists, and analysts, to inves-
tigate and uncover significant fraud
schemes. His team was also an integral
part of the recent high-profile fraud
case involving misuse of disaster relief
funds that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency administered in
Puerto Rico following Hurricane
Maria.
Jim has had a long and distinguished
career in the military, where he has
served for over 26 years. He first served
for 4 years in the Marine Corps, and
after going to college, he joined the Air
Force Reserve, where he has risen
through the ranks to his current posi-
tion as colonel.
Jim continues to have a stellar ca-
reer serving the Nation, including
being deployed to Kirkuk, Iraq, in 2008,
where he commanded 57 combat mis-
sions.
Again, I wish to congratulate Colonel
Long on his promotion and wish him
and his family the very best as he con-
tinues to serve our Nation, both in his
capacities at the Air Force Reserve and
at the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity.∑

TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL
GREGORY A. LUSK
∑ Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I rise
today to pay MG Gregory A. Lusk, the
Adjutant General of the North Carolina
National Guard, for his many years of
service to the great State of North
Carolina.
Major General Lusk has served as the
40th Adjutant General of the North
Carolina National Guard with distinc-
tion for nearly a decade. Major General
Lusk’s adept leadership over the rough-
ly 11,500 citizen soldiers and airmen
serving in the North Carolina Army
and Air National Guard has been
prominently displayed during the mul-
tiple harrowing natural disasters that
have struck North Carolina in recent
years. In 2018, Major General Lusk
oversaw a massive mobilization of N.C.
Guardsmen prior to the landfall of Hur-
ricane Florence. During the ensuing de-
ployment, 3,400 N.C. Guardsmen as-
sisted local, State, and Federal disaster
response teams on hundreds dangerous
search and rescue operations vital mis-
sions to provide lifesaving relief to
evacuated families. In total, more than
1,300 North Carolinians were safely
evacuated from dangerous floodwaters
due to the effective command of Major
General Lusk and the efforts of the
North Carolina National Guard.
The tireless leadership of Major Gen-
eral Lusk has been invaluable during
the numerous overseas deployments,
stateside military exercises, and nat-
ural disaster responses that the North
Carolina National Guard has partici-
pated in since his appointment to adju-
tant general in 2010. Major General
Lusk’s contribution to advancing the
overall readiness and operational capa-
bilities of the North Carolina National
Guard has been critical in maintaining
an effective and resilient Reserve
Force. Through operations including
Inherent Resolve, Enduring Freedom,
and Freedom’s Sentinel, as well as dur-
ing the Hurricanes Irene, Matthew,
Florence, and Dorian, Major General
Lusk has ensured that the men and
women of the Guard had the utmost
preparation and training for every mis-
sion that they embarked on.
Major General Lusk has selflessly
served the state of North Carolina and
our Nation for almost 40 years. Fol-
lowing his commissioning through the
Reserve Officer Training Program at
North Carolina State University in
1982, Major General Lusk was stationed
throughout the State and around the
world as he rose from a second lieuten-
ant to a major general. Major General
Lusk was mobilized twice to Iraq as
both an executive officer and a com-
mander of the 30th Heavy Brigade Com-
bat Team, commanding 4,000 North
Carolina Guardsmen in support of Op-
eration Iraqi Freedom.
As a U.S. Senator, a member of the
Senate Armed Services Committee,
and a North Carolinian, I am pleased to
congratulate Major General Gregory
Lusk on his retirement, for his impres-
sive career of military service and
steadfast commitment to our country.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and
were referred or ordered to lie on the
table as indicated:
POM–151. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Michigan urging the
United States Congress to speedily approve
the recently negotiated United States-Mex-
ico-Canada Agreement; to the Committee on
Finance.
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 73
Whereas, The North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) is a close tri-lateral re-
lationship between the United States, Can-
ada, and Mexico. For more than 25 years,
NAFTA has been economically, culturally,
and strategically important for all parties;
and
Whereas, NAFTA is significant for the
American economy. Trade with Canada and
Mexico supports nearly 12 million American
jobs, and nearly 5 million of those jobs are
supported by increased NAFTA trade. Since
the agreement began in 1994, trade with Can-
ada and Mexico has nearly quadrupled to $1.3
trillion, and the two countries buy more
than one-third of U.S. merchandise exports.
U.S. service exports to Canada and Mexico
have also tripled, rising from $27.5 billion in
1993 to $91.3 billion in 2017, thanks to the
trade agreement’s new market access and
clearer rules; and
Whereas, Trade with Canada and Mexico is
significant to U.S. states. For 43 states, our
contiguous international neighbors represent
the first or second largest export market,
and all but one state counts Canada or Mex-
ico as a top three trading partner. Canada is
Michigan’s largest export market, and Mex-
ico is Michigan’s third largest export mar-
ket. NAFTA has also contributed to a 300
percent increase in Michigan’s agricultural
exports to Canada and Mexico; and
Whereas, Small and medium-sized enter-
prises in the United States rely on trade
with Canada and Mexico to support and grow
their business. Canada and Mexico are the
top two export destinations for U.S. small
and medium-sized enterprises, more than

125,000 of which sold their goods and services
in Canada and Mexico in 2014; and
Whereas, Trade among our North Amer-
ican trading partners is made up predomi-
nantly of intellectual property (IP)-intensive
goods and services that employ millions of
Americans in high paying jobs and generate
billions of dollars in economic output. How-
ever, many of the IP-intensive goods, serv-
ices, and exchanges through which trade is
facilitated did not exist when the agreement
was drafted. This situation has resulted in
uneven and weak IP enforcement. Stronger
enforcement of IP rights will encourage
more foreign direct investment and increase
gross domestic product; and
Whereas, The United States-Mexico-Can-
ada Agreement (USMCA) creates a 21st Cen-
tury trade agreement for North America.
The renegotiated USMCA has provisions fa-
vorable to U.S. autoworkers that would help
level the playing field between U.S. and
Mexican autoworkers. The updated agree-
ment is also more beneficial to the agricul-
tural sector than NAFTA and will offer a
higher degree of certainty and stability to
Michigan farmers. The new IP provisions are
the most comprehensive of any multilateral
U.S. trade agreement and are vastly superior
to those included in NAFTA; and
Whereas, The USMCA is a win for all three
countries. Ratification will modernize North
American trade, reduce uncertainty by set-
ting the rules for every player, encourage in-
vestment and innovation, and support mil-
lions of well-paying manufacturing jobs. The
USMCA will also encourage automotive re-
search and development investments in the
United States and ensure that the U.S. auto-
motive industry, which is fundamental to
the Michigan economy, remains a leader in
the global economy; and
Whereas, A seamless transition between
NAFTA and the USMCA will ensure that
none of the benefits in trade accomplished by
the integration of the three North American
economies will be lost; Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate, That we urge the
Congress of the United States to speedily ap-
prove the recently negotiated United States-
Mexico-Canada Agreement; and be it further
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be
transmitted to the President of the United
States Senate, the Speaker of the United
States House of Representatives, and the
members of the Michigan congressional dele-
gation.
POM–152. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Michigan urging the
United States Congress to increase funding
for Sickle cell disease research; to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, and
Pensions.
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 80
Whereas, Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a dis-
abling inherited blood disorder that causes
the production of abnormally shaped (sick-
led) red blood cells that can stick together
and block the flow of blood and oxygen. SCD
leads to severe medical problems, including
unpredictable episodes of excruciating pain,
organ damage, anemia, increased suscepti-
bility to infection, stroke, and decreased life
span; and
Whereas, SCD poses a serious threat to
public health. SCD affects approximately
100,000 individuals in the United States, in-
cluding 1,000 babies born each year. The dis-
ease disproportionately impacts people of Af-
rican, Middle Eastern, and South American
descent. In 2016, there were approximately
134,000 hospital inpatient stays and nearly
250,000 emergency department visits related
to SCD, both leading to increased medical
costs, and
Whereas, There is no universal cure for
SCD. Stem cell transplantation is currently
the only cure, and it is not necessarily ap-
propriate for all SCD patients. There have
been advancements in treating the complica-
tions of SCD, but more research is needed to
study emerging treatments, including thera-
pies to address the underlying cause of the
disease; and
Whereas, SCD research is underfunded
compared to other rare inherited diseases,
such as cystic fibrosis. Additional funding
for SCD research is imperative to identify
new treatments and cures to help patients
with SCD and address the public health risks
posed by the disease; Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate, That we urge the
United States Congress to increase funding
for sickle cell disease research; and be it fur-
ther
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be
transmitted to the President of the United
States Senate, the Speaker of the United
States House of Representatives, and mem-
bers of the Michigan congressional delega-
tion.
POM–153. A resolution adopted by the
Board of Trustees of the Village of
Rhinebeck, New York urging the United
States Congress to pass the Energy Innova-
tion and Carbon Dividend Act; to the Com-
mittee on Finance.
POM–154. A resolution adopted by the Se-
lect Board of the Town of North Hampton,
New Hampshire urging the United States
Congress to pass the Energy Innovation and
Carbon Dividend Act; to the Committee on
Finance.
POM–155. A resolution adopted by the
Council of the Town of Red Hook, New York
urging the United States Congress to pass
the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend
Act; to the Committee on Finance.
POM–156. A resolution adopted by the
Commission of the Caddo Parish, Louisiana
urging the United States Congress to protect
funding for local public health services and
prevention programs made possible by the
Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF);
to the Committee on Health, Education,
Labor, and Pensions.

By Mr. MERKLEY (for himself
and Mr. DURBIN):
S. 2817. A bill to require the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services
to establish an annual reference price
for insulin products for purposes of
Federal health programs, and for other
purposes; to the Committee on Health,
Education, Labor, and Pensions.
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, Cana-
dian historian Michael Bliss wrote in
his 1982 book, ‘‘The Discovery of Insu-
lin,’’ that ‘‘[w]ith insulin, the stone
was rolled away, and diabetes became a
matter of the quality of life, not speed
of death.’’
For thousands of years, human
beings have battled diabetes. When the
pancreas stops producing insulin, all
kinds of bad things happen—heart at-
tacks, stroke, blindness, kidney fail-
ure, foot disease, foot amputations,
small blood vessels throughout the
body being impacted by that high blood
sugar. In some cases, within months,
individuals waste away, fall into dia-
betic comas, and die.
All that changed about a century ago
thanks to the work of four Canadian
scientists—Frederick Banting, Charles
Best, J.B. Collip, and John Macleod.
These four men discovered how to ex-
tract, develop, and refine a pure form
of insulin that could be injected into
the human body. It changed the world.
Thirty million Americans—almost 10
percent, 9.4 percent, of the American
population live with type 1 or type 2 di-
abetes today. Of those 30 million, 7.4
million depend on insulin for their sur-
vival, but one-quarter of the people
who depend on insulin for their sur-
vival have had to ration their insulin
in the past year because of the extraor-
dinary, over-the-Moon cost of this drug
that was developed a century ago.
Rationing the drug, and therefore
producing episodes or enduring levels
of high blood sugar, has extensive
health consequences. It does a lot of
damage. Diabetic Americans are being
gouged by the drug companies, and it
needs to stop.
Today I am introducing, in partner-
ship with Senator DURBIN, the End
Price Gouging for Insulin Act to end
this egregious practice. I want to en-
sure that every single one of those 7.4
million Americans who need insulin to
survive can afford it. I want to ensure
that not a single person has to ration
their insulin. I can tell you that vision
of every person having affordable insu-
lin is what the four scientists who in-
vented it nearly 100 years ago envi-
sioned. They didn’t ask for great
wealth from their work. They did re-
ceive recognition. A Nobel Prize went
to two of them for their role in this.
They certainly weren’t asking for huge
payouts or a high price. Do you know
what they did? For the health of hu-
manity, they sold their patent to the
University of Toronto for $3 to make
insulin available to the world. All they
cared about was saving lives. They
wanted everyone who needed it to have
it.
What do we see today? Almost a cen-
tury later, the price of insulin is going
higher and higher with the extensive
greed of the companies that produce it.
Over the last decade, the companies
selling the four most popular types of
insulin have tripled the price of their
product—essentially the same product.
They tripled the price. Nova Nordisk
has two of these drugs; Sanofi has one;
Eli Lilly has another—and they all tri-
pled the price.
In 2012, the average price of insulin
was about $234 a month. By 2016, it was
$450 a month. Now we have seen it con-
tinue to rise since 2016. They have
some explanations. There are some who
say: Well, it is due to their vast input
into research and development. Re-
member, these are drugs invented a
century ago. Sure, there are slight
variations, yes, but the money is going
largely to profit.
There are those who say the price is
higher because more people need it.
More people buying it means more effi-
ciencies, which means the price should
drop. The nonprofit Health Care Cost
Institute looked at the rising cost of
insulin and said the excuses given by
the drug companies just straight out
aren’t true. ‘‘It’s not that individuals
are using more insulin or that new
products are particularly innovative or
provide immense benefits. Use is pretty
flat,’’ said Ms. Fugelsten Biniek, one of
the authors. ‘‘And the price changes
are occurring in both older and newer
products.’’
The reason the prices are going up—
the companies are charging more—is
because they can because we don’t ne-
gotiate the price of drugs in America
by law for Medicare.
These companies have some tricks up
their sleeve. One is that when the ge-
neric competition gets all lined up,
they proceed to pay the generic compa-
nies not to produce the generic drug,
resulting in sustaining the price
gouging in America.
Now, I think this practice is ‘‘pay to
delay.’’ I think it is a horrific preda-
tory practice. It is a noncompetitive
practice. It should be against the law,
but we are not doing our job to make it
against the law, apparently.
The other thing is they make slight
changes. They produce a new patent on
every tiny, microscopic change—it is
called the evergreening of patents—so
then they can line up a vast array of
lawyers and say: If you produce generic
insulin, we will go after you in every
which way. We have more lawyers than
you have, and we have deeper pockets
than you have. So good luck.
The result is a continuation of the
extensive price gouging of Americans.
A quarter of those 7.4 million Ameri-
cans who need insulin to treat their di-
abetes are rationing their prescrip-
tions. Sometimes that means just
straight out skipping the doses alto-
gether.
Folks from Oregon have written to
me, people like Richard from Bea-
verton, OR.
Richard needs three lifesaving medi-
cations to get by, including the insulin
Humalog, which costs over $1,800 a
year. Richard doesn’t have $1,800 to
spare. He is 77 years old, blind, and re-
cently finished chemo treatments for
bladder cancer. Through it all, he has
continued to work odd jobs to supple-
ment his Social Security to be able to
put food on the table for him and his
wife, to be able to keep their house,
and try to pay for those prescriptions.
Another constituent whom I will call
Antonio is 58 years old and is living
with type 1 diabetes, but like so many
others, he has trouble affording the
prescription. Antonio either uses insu-
lin samples that he finds in his truck,
which are about 10 years old, or he ra-
tions out the insulin that he does have
to make it last until his monthly dis-
ability check comes in, which is when
he can afford to get a new refill on the
prescription.
This is a terrible strategy for man-
aging an illness. It has led to hospital
stays, diabetic ketoacidosis, kidney
failure, visual impairment, and other
diabetes-related ailments. Yet, from
Antonio’s perspective, what can he do?
He can’t afford the massive price in-
creases these major drug companies
have put on insulin. As for the generic
he would like to buy, those same com-
panies are blocking it from coming to
market.
There is also Maria. Maria has sores
on her feet because of her diabetes. She
has been to the emergency room sev-
eral times for foot infections. It turns
out that her feet keep getting infected
because she is forgoing her insulin to
be able to afford basic necessities for
her family—food, the cost of her hous-
ing, and transportation.
It turns out Maria’s insurance
doesn’t cover the $50 copay on diabetic
shoes or her insulin or the injection
medication that she takes to reduce
her insulin needs, all of which would
have reduced or eliminated the need
for Maria to go to the emergency room.
Yet her insurance does cover the emer-
gency room visits. So, time and again,
with her not being able to afford the
medicine, that is where Maria ends up.
Another Oregonian whom I will call
Phillip is living with type 2 diabetes.
He said he takes less insulin than his
doctor has prescribed. Why? He isn’t
able to afford the prescription. Yet
Phillip doesn’t want his provider to
know any of this, because he is embar-
rassed about it. So his blood sugars are

routinely at high levels and are doing a
lot of damage to his body. It has led to
the diabetic-related complications of
severe kidney damage, visual impair-
ment, peripheral vascular disease, and
heart disease.
Think about this for a moment. The
pharmaceutical companies are gouging
him on the price, but it is Phillip—he
who has the diabetes—who feels embar-
rassed. Shouldn’t it be the other way
around? Shouldn’t the companies be
embarrassed about gouging Americans?
I think so. The drugmakers are prof-
iting off of sick Americans, and their
predatory practices are designed to
keep competitors from coming to the
market. These are American citizens
who are being affected while living in
one of the wealthiest nations on the
planet—the United States of America.
Yet they can’t afford a century-old
drug that is meant to be freely shared
with the world.
It doesn’t have to be this way. The
same kind of insulin that costs $373
here in the United States costs $47 in
Australia. Why? The Australian Gov-
ernment negotiates the price. It is past
time we stood up for the American peo-
ple and put an end to the price gouging
of Americans.
In France, the drug Lantus is $47. In
Australia, it is $54. In Germany, it is
$61. In the United Kingdom, it is $64. In
Canada, it is $67. In the United States
of America, it is $373. That is six times
the median price of the drug in these
other developed nations.
Why don’t we insist that the compa-
nies that get all kinds of benefits from
being here in America sell to Ameri-
cans at the median price or at the aver-
age price—either one—which is what
they sell to the rest of the developed
world? Why is it a fair price for every
other country, but it is gouging for
Americans?
Americans pay the price. Those who
have diabetes but who cannot afford
that insulin start rationing it and start
to see the devastating impacts on their
bodies—from the kidneys, to the vi-
sion, to the feet, to the heart disease.
Then they end up in the hospital, as
well, with there being more costs to
the U.S. healthcare system. Don’t we
care about the health of Americans?
Are we here to protect greed for these
companies or the health of Americans?
Senator DURBIN and I have intro-
duced a bill that says you can’t charge
more in America than the reference
price that is charged in key developed
countries around the world—Canada,
Australia, Japan—or charge more than
the median price in the group of eight
of the largest European nations. It
doesn’t even have to be the lowest
price in the world under this formula-
tion. This is called a reference price
bill, wherein we essentially attach our-
selves to the fair prices charged to the
rest of the world.
The drug companies will say: We
want to make more money so we can
do more research.
Well, raise your price on these other
countries while you are dropping the
price for the United States. That is a
pretty simple solution that ends the
price gouging in the United States of
America.
If a company violates this reference
price, then it pays a fine of 10 times the
difference between the reference price
and the price it charges Americans.
Where does that money go? It goes to
the research and development of new
drug products in our bill.
That is the vision. There is no reason
that Americans should be paying six
times the median price of other devel-
oped countries—six times. This is not 6
percent more or 60 percent more, which
would be outrageous. This is six times
the price charged to other developed
countries.
It is way past time that we stood up
for the American people, not the greed
of the pharmaceutical companies. It is
way past time that we stood up for sick
Americans like Richard and Antonio
and Maria and Phillip and millions
more in every one of our States. Mil-
lions of Americans are forced to ration
their insulin or skip doses altogether
because of corporate greed. It is way
past time to end the price gouging of
Americans.
Let’s put this bill on the floor, and
let’s pass this bill for our citizens
across this great land.

November 7, 2019
submitted the following resolution;
which was considered and agreed to:
S. RES. 412
Whereas family service learning is a meth-
od under which children and families learn
and solve problems together in a multi-
generational approach with active participa-
tion in thoughtfully organized service that—
(1) is conducted in, and meets the needs of,
their communities;
(2) is focused on children and families solv-
ing community issues together;
(3) requires the application of college and
career readiness skills by children and rel-
evant workforce training skills by adults;
and
(4) is coordinated between the community
and an elementary school, a secondary
school, an institution of higher education, or
a family community service program;
Whereas family service learning—
(1) is multi-generational learning that in-
volves parents, children, caregivers, and ex-
tended family members in shared learning
experiences in physical and digital environ-
ments;
(2) is integrated into and enhances the aca-
demic achievement of children or the edu-
cational components of a family service pro-
gram in which families may be enrolled; and
(3) promotes skills (such as investigation,
planning, and preparation), action, reflec-
tion, the demonstration of results, and sus-
tainability;
Whereas family service learning has been
shown to have positive 2-generational effects
and encourages families to invest in their
communities to improve economic and soci-
etal well-being;
Whereas, through family service learning,
children and families have the opportunity
to solve community issues and learn to-
gether, thereby enabling the development of
life and career skills, such as flexibility and
adaptability, initiative and self-direction,
social and cross-cultural skills, productivity
and accountability, and leadership and re-
sponsibility;
Whereas family service learning activities
provide opportunities for families to improve
essential skills, such as organization, re-
search, planning, reading and writing, tech-
nological literacy, teamwork, and sharing;
Whereas families participating together in
service are afforded quality time learning
about their communities;
Whereas adults engaged in family service
learning serve as positive role models for
their children;
Whereas family service learning projects
enable families to build substantive connec-
tions with their communities, develop a
stronger sense of self-worth, experience a re-
duction in social isolation, and improve par-
enting skills;
Whereas family service learning has added
benefits for English language learners by
helping individuals and families to—
(1) feel more connected with their commu-
nities; and
(2) practice language skills;
Whereas family service learning is particu-
larly important for at-risk families because
family service learning—
(1) provides opportunities for leadership
and civic engagement; and
(2) helps build the capacity to advocate for
the needs of children and families; and
Whereas the value that parents place on
civic engagement and relationships within
the community has been shown to transfer
to children who, in turn, replicate important
values, such as responsibility, empathy, and
caring for others: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) supports the designation of the week of
November 4 through November 8, 2019, as
‘‘National Family Service Learning Week’’
to raise public awareness about the impor-
tance of family service learning, family lit-
eracy, community service, and 2-
generational learning experiences;
(2) encourages people across the United
States to support family service learning and
community development programs;
(3) recognizes the importance that family
service learning plays in cultivating family
literacy, civic engagement, and community
investment; and
(4) calls upon public, private, and nonprofit
entities to support family service learning
opportunities to aid in the advancement of
families.

S. RES. 416
Whereas the people of the United States
seek to strengthen relations with the People
of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and ensure that
they enjoy free and fair democratic elec-
tions, the rule of law, and the fundamental
freedoms of expression, association, and as-
sembly;
Whereas the Government of Cambodia has
taken a series of steps to undermine demo-
cratic institutions, human rights, and free-
dom of expression;
Whereas, on several occasions since 2017,
the Prime Minister of Cambodia, Hun Sen,
has urged opposition lawmakers to defect
and join the ruling Cambodian People’s
Party (CPP), and security forces coerced
many such defections under threat and du-
ress;
Whereas Cambodian authorities arrested
the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP)
opposition leader Kem Sokha on September
3, 2017, for allegedly committing treason, and
continue to restrict his movements and com-
munications to conditions amounting to
house arrest over two years later;
Whereas, having outlawed the CNRP on
November 16, 2017, having banned 118 of its
members from politics, and having passed
amendments to its Law on Political Parties
that were intended to stifle independent po-
litical parties, the CPP won all 125 National
Assembly seats in the July 29, 2018, national
election;

other unlawful or politically motivated
killings, arbitrary arrest or detention, denial
of fair public trial, and other violations;
Whereas Freedom House assessed Cam-
bodia to be ‘‘not free’’ in its Freedom in the
World 2019 report;
Whereas the crackdown by the Govern-
ment of Cambodia on the political opposition
and other independent voices has caused
many CNRP leaders to flee abroad;
Whereas, according to Human Rights
Watch, on March 12, 2019, a court criminally
charged and issued arrest warrants for eight
leading members of the CNRP who had left
Cambodia ahead of the July 2018 election:
Sam Rainsy, Mu Sochua, Ou Chanrith, Eng
Chhai Eang, Men Sothavarin, Long Ry, Tob
Van Chan, and Ho Vann;
Whereas the Government of Cambodia has
arrested many opposition party members
and democracy activists who remained in
Cambodia, including bringing charges
against more than 70 former CNRP members
and detaining at least 35 of them since CNRP
members announced in August 2019 that they
might return to the country;
Whereas a Cambodian court ordered a new
investigation into two Radio Free Asia jour-
nalists charged with espionage even after
two years of inquiry found insufficient evi-
dence of wrongdoing and after numerous
human rights experts and a bipartisan group
of United States Senators in a March 15, 2018,
letter to Hun Sen argued that the charges
were meritless;
Whereas former CNRP leader, Sam Rainsy,
and other members of the CNRP and sup-
porters of democracy intend to return to
Cambodia on November 9, 2019;
Whereas Prime Minister Hun Sen threat-
ened students that they would have one of
their ‘‘remaining fingers cut off’’ if they
joined the cause of the returning democracy
activists and ordered the military to attack
any CNRP gatherings on November 9, 2019;
Whereas according to Amnesty Inter-
national, two youth activists have been arbi-
trarily detained since July for attempting to
peacefully commemorate the murder of a
popular government critic;
Whereas, on November 16, 2017, the United
States Senate unanimously passed Senate
Resolution 279 (115th Congress), a bipartisan
resolution reaffirming the commitment of
the United States to promote democracy,
human rights, and the rule of law in Cam-
bodia; and
Whereas the Asia Reassurance Initiative
Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–409) prohibits the
authorization of appropriations to the Gov-
ernment of Cambodia until the Secretary of
State certifies that Cambodia is taking ef-
fective steps in several areas, including the
restoration of the civil and political rights of
the CNRP, media, and civil society organiza-
tions: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Senate—
(1) urges the Government of Cambodia to
immediately and unconditionally—
(A) release all political prisoners;
(B) drop all politically motivated charges
against the CNRP and civil society activists;
and
(C) restore full political rights to the
CNRP;

(A) the deterioration of democracy and
fundamental human rights in Cambodia;
(B) the continued imprisonment and judi-
cial harassment of journalists, prisoners of
conscience, and other political prisoners by
the Government of Cambodia;
(C) the breakdown of the rule of law and
the lack of due process in Cambodia; and
(D) the potential for mass arrests and vio-
lence if and when CNRP members currently
overseas return to Cambodia;
(3) holds Prime Minister Hun Sen directly
responsible for the safety, health, and wel-
fare of exiled CNRP leaders and their sup-
porters upon their return to Cambodia;
(4) calls on other governments throughout
the Indo-Pacific to—
(A) urge the Government of Cambodia to
allow the peaceful return of exiled CNRP
leaders and their supporters; and
(B) refrain from unjustly restricting the
rights of CNRP members to travel to and
through their countries as they return; and
(5) recognizes, in the absence of systemic
democratic reforms, the need for additional
United States Government measures, includ-
ing through legislation and executive action.
